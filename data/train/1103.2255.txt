    "the transversity of the nucleon has been one of the most important issues in hadronic physics well over decades .",
    "while the non - polarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and longitudinally polarized pdfs have been extensively studied experimentally as well as theoretically , the transversity of the nucleon suffers from experimental difficulties to measure it . only very recently",
    ", the tensor charges @xmath8 were extracted  @xcite from the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the qcdsf and ukqcd lattice collaborations reported also the tensor charges in the context of the spin structure of the nucleon  @xcite .    in this talk , we present recent results of the tensor and tensor anomalous magnetic form factors within the framework of the self - consistent su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath9qsm )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9qsm was known to describe successfully the mass splittings of su(3 ) baryons and static properties and form factors of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the model has certain merits : first it does not have any adjustable parameters .",
    "the cut - off parameter is fixed to the pion decay constant , the current quark mass is fitted in such a way that it reproduces kaon properties . the constituent quark mass , which is regarded as only one free parameter of the model , is also fixed to 420 mev with which the electric properties of the nucleon are well reproduced .",
    "secondly , it is a fully relativistic field - theoretic model .",
    "we will see why it is essential to describe the tensor properties of the nucleon .",
    "tensor charges of the nucleon were also investigated within this framework  @xcite .",
    "however , the old version of the su(3 ) @xmath9qsm was hampered by the symmetry - nonconserving quantization , which causes the breaking of gauge invariance .",
    "thus , it is necessary to revisit the tensor charges of the nucleon within the @xmath9qsm and we present in this talk the new results of the tensor charges and their form factors , and those of the anomalous tensor magnetic form factors , closely following refs .",
    "we will also compare the results of the present talk with the empirical data as well as those lattice calculation .",
    "the detailed formalism can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we briefly report the results of the tensor charges and anomalous tensor magnetic moments and their form factors .",
    "the tensor charges are identical to the axial - vector charges in the non - relativistic limit , i.e. the singlet and triplet parts are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . in table",
    "[ tab : tensor_charge ] , we summarize the results of the tensor and axial - vector charges from the su(2 ) and su(3 ) @xmath9qsm .",
    ".[tab : tensor_charge ] tensor charges for the singlet , triplet , and octet components in comparison with the axial - vector charges . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : ht ] , we draw the results of the scaled flavor tensor form factors in comparison with those of the lattice calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : ht ] shows that the lattice results decrease in general almost linearly as @xmath12 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the present results fall off more rapidly .",
    "this is not a surprizing result , because a similar behavior was also found in the @xmath13 electric quadrupole form factor as shown in ref .",
    "these differences of the @xmath12 dependence may be due to the fact that the heavy pion mass was employed in the lattice calculation .",
    "moreover , this has been shown explicitly for the nucleon isovector form factor @xmath14 on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "flavor tensor form factors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the proton .",
    "we compare the present results of the renormalization - independent scaled tensor form factors @xmath18 , @xmath19 with those of the lattice qcd  @xcite . the red ( solid ) curves designate the @xmath9qsm form factors of this work while the blue ( dashed ) ones corrrespond to the factors from the lattice qcd calculation.,title=\"fig : \" ]    flavor tensor form factors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the proton .",

    "being similar to the case of the tensor form factors , the lattice results decrease more slowly than those of the present work .",
    "however , the down form factor is comparable to the lattice one .     the comparison of the up and down anomalous tensor magnetic form factors with lattice results .",
    "the solid curves draw the results of the present work with @xmath20 mev , whereas the dashed ones depict the lattice results  @xcite . in the left panel ,",
    "the result of the up anomalous tensor magnetic form factor is compared to that of the lattice .",

    "in the present talk , we have reported the recent results of the tensor properties of the nucleon .",
    "the tensor charges and anomalous tensor magnetic moments were calculated .",
    "the results are in good agreement with those of the lattice calculation except for the down anomalous tensor magnetic moment .",
    "the tensor form factors and anomalous tensor form factors were also presented and compared with the lattice results .",
    "the present results can be used to describe the transverse spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "the corresponding investigation is under way .",
