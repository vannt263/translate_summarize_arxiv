    "interpreting observational properties of t  tauri systems is closely tied to understanding the complex dynamical evolution of gaseous protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) , both in terms of their chemistry , and in terms of the microphysics that govern the evolution of the embedded magnetic fields . moreover , with ppds being the birth sites for extrasolar planets , a sound physical picture of the dust @xcite and planetesimal @xcite evolution is needed to ultimately provide the building blocks for a comprehensive theory of planet formation .",
    "the fundamental drivers of disk evolution are mass loss processes and redistribution of angular momentum @xcite . in sufficiently ionized parts of the disk , the latter can be achieved by turbulent stresses . when accounting for the ionization structure of a typical ppd , large parts of the disk , however , remain laminar owing to the effect of ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) . in this situation",
    ", angular momentum is primarily transported via a magnetocentrifugal disk wind @xcite .",
    "while this picture is further complicated when accounting for the hall effect , it has nevertheless become clear that the thermal structure of the disk plays an important role in setting the mass loading of the disk wind @xcite , and hence the timescale on which the system evolves @xcite .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , we are solving the single - fluid mhd equations including ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion , that is , the electromotive force resulting from the mutual collision of ions and neutrals .",
    "the diffusion coefficients , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are specified by means of a look - up table , which has been obtained by solving a simple chemical ionization / recombination network .",
    "the resulting electromotive forces stemming from the ohmic and ambipolar diffusion terms are then given by @xmath3 @xmath4\\times{\\hat{{\\mathbf b}}}\\ , ,    \\label{eq : emf_ad}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 being the unit vector along @xmath6 , and where the double vector product results in an additional minus sign , such that positive coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 signify diffusion of magnetic fields , with the latter only being sensitive to currents perpendicular to the field direction .    for the typical number densities in the context of ppds , the frictional coupling between the ions and neutrals happens so quickly ( compared to dynamical timescales of interest ) that we assume the charged species move at their terminal velocity with respect to the neutrals , that is , where the lorentz force is balanced by the drag .",
    "because of the low degree of ionization , we formulate our continuity equation and momentum conservation in terms of the neutral component , although it does experience the lorentz force as mediated by particle collisions .",
    "we use a modified version of the nirvana - iii finite volume godunov code @xcite .",
    "the code adopts a total - energy formulation , in the total energy ( as it is sub - dominant in the problem we consider ) .",
    "we however retain the radiation flux in the momentum equation for consistency . ] with conserved variables @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . together with the conservation of radiation energy , @xmath10 , and defining the total pressure , @xmath11 , as the sum of the gas and magnetic pressures , the system of equations we solve reads @xmath12    \\partial_t(\\rho{\\mathbf v } ) + \\nabla{\\!\\cdot\\!}\\big[\\rho\\mathbf{vv}+p^{\\star}i-\\mathbf{bb}\\,\\big ] & = &            - \\rho \\nabla\\phi + \\rho{\\kappa_{\\rm r}}/c\\,{\\mathbf f_{\\rm r}}\\ , , \\\\[4pt ]    \\partial_t e + \\nabla{\\!\\cdot\\!}\\big[(e + p^{\\star}){\\mathbf v}- ( { \\mathbf v}{\\!\\cdot\\!}{\\mathbf b}){\\mathbf b}\\,\\big ] & = &    \\label{eq : ene }            \\nabla \\cdot \\big[\\ , ( { \\mathbf e_{\\rm o}}\\!+\\!{\\mathbf e_{\\rm ad}}){\\!\\times\\!}{\\mathbf b}\\,\\big ]          - \\rho ( \\nabla\\phi){\\!\\cdot\\!}{\\mathbf v}\\nonumber\\\\        & & + \\,c\\,\\rho{\\kappa_{\\rm p}}\\left({e_{\\rm r}}-{a_{\\rm r}}\\,t^4\\right )            + \\rho{\\kappa_{\\rm r}}/c\\,{\\mathbf f_{\\rm r}}{\\!\\cdot\\!}{\\mathbf v}+ { \\mathcal{q}^+_{\\rm irr}}\\ , , \\\\[4pt ]    \\partial_t { e_{\\rm r}}+ \\nabla{\\!\\cdot\\!}({e_{\\rm r}}{\\mathbf v } ) & = &                \\label{eq : erad }            -\\,c\\,\\rho{\\kappa_{\\rm p}}\\left({e_{\\rm r}}-{a_{\\rm r}}\\,t^4\\right )            - \\nabla{\\!\\cdot\\!}{\\mathbf f_{\\rm r}}- { \\mathcal{p}_{\\rm r}}\\!:\\!\\nabla{\\mathbf v}\\ , , \\\\[4pt ]    \\partial_t { \\mathbf b}-\\!\\nabla{\\!\\times\\!}\\big[\\ , { \\mathbf v}{\\!\\times\\!}{\\mathbf b}\\label{eq : ind }                             + { \\mathbf e_{\\rm o}}+ { \\mathbf e_{\\rm ad}}\\,\\big ] & = & 0    \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the radiation flux , @xmath14 is the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the rosseland and planck mean opacities , respectively , @xmath17 is the radiation density constant , @xmath18 is the gas temperature , and the gas pressure is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is chosen as appropriate for an ideal diatomic gas .",
    "the gravitational term @xmath21 represents the point - mass potential of the solar - mass star at the center of our spherical - polar coordinate system , and @xmath22 represents external irradiation heating due to the star .",
    "the above equations can only be solved once the radiation flux and pressure tensor are specified .",
    "an attractive method for obtaining the eddington tensor that relates @xmath14 with @xmath10 is to solve for the steady - state but angle - dependent radiation intensity and integrate the first ( for @xmath13 ) and second ( for @xmath14 ) order moments directly @xcite . in the interest of maintaining minimum algorithmic complexity and computational expense ,",
    "we instead adopt the classical _ ad hoc _",
    "closure @xmath23 that specifies @xmath13 in terms of a diffusive flux with diffusion coefficient @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a dimensionless number specifying how abruptly the radiation energy density varies compared to the length scale defined by the optical extinction coefficient @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) is a limiter function @xcite that guarantees @xmath29 in regions of low optical depth , that is , in regions where the diffusion approximation is not valid . in the optically thick limit , @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) , which corresponds to the eddington approximation .",
    "the described approach has its known shortcomings over characteristics - based methods @xcite , but in combination with stellar irradiation heating ( determined using a simplified ray tracing algorithm ) it has been deemed an acceptable compromise in terms of being able to incorporate radiation thermodynamics in fully dynamical 3d simulations , whereas more accurate monte carlo methods are comparatively expensive and have to deal with statistical noise @xcite .",
    "we currently treat both irradiation and diffuse redistribution in the _ gray _ approximation , but multigroup approaches are straightforward , especially for the irradiation component , wherein computational expenditure scales with the number of frequency bins , and where increased realism can be achieved for the thermal structure of the outer disk ( @xmath32 ) . for our ppd model , we precompute look - up tables for mean opacities , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , using d.  semenov s ` opacity.f ` , where a fixed dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath35 is assumed . to account for depletion of small dust by grain growth , we enable the reduction of the obtained opacities by a scale factor . since the opacity tables combine contributions from dust grains and gas molecules ,",
    "this is only valid for temperatures below the dust sublimation threshold .",
    "the thermodynamic coupling of the gaseous matter with the radiation field is described by the @xmath36 terms in eqns .",
    "( [ eq : ene ] ) and ( [ eq : erad ] ) , respectively . subsuming the @xmath37 term in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : erad ] ) with the definition of the diffusive flux ( [ eq : flux ] ) amounts to a diffusion equation for the redistribution of radiation energy .",
    "both effects can be combined into the subsystem @xmath38    \\frac{c}{\\hat{c}}\\ ; \\partial_t { e_{\\rm r } } & = &            -\\,c\\,\\rho{\\kappa_{\\rm p}}\\left({e_{\\rm r}}-{a_{\\rm r}}\\,t^4\\right )            + \\nabla{\\!\\cdot\\!}\\big [ d\\ , \\nabla{e_{\\rm r}}\\big]\\ , ,   \\label{eq : radif } \\ ] ] which we solve by means of operator splitting . unlike in ref .",
    ", we do not include the @xmath39 term in this subsystem but instead treat it as a regular source term when updating the main hyperbolic system of equations .",
    "since , for a large diffusion coefficient @xmath40 , the parabolic system ( [ eq : radif ] ) becomes stiff , the most common approach is to use implicit methods to solve it . especially in view of applications employing adaptive mesh refinement ,",
    "we have chosen to avoid an implicit update for @xmath41 , as it demands costly non - local communication patterns , and a potentially expensive matrix inversion .",
    "instead , we integrate the diffusion part of ( [ eq : radif ] ) in a time - explicit fashion , and use the _ reduced speed of light _",
    "approach @xcite to ameliorate the strict time - step constraints .",
    "this method has recently been employed in the context of simulations of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the approximation is valid as long as the radiative timescales resulting from the adopted artificial value of @xmath42 ( with @xmath43const.@xmath44 ) are still short compared to any relevant dynamical timescales . in the context of ppds , we are mainly interested in the role of radiative effects in setting the consistent temperature structure of the disk , and true radiation hydrodynamic effects",
    "are believed to only be of minor importance during the t  tauri phase @xcite .",
    "the approximation is introduced by amplifying the left - hand - side of ( [ eq : radif ] ) by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "it is crucial that , because all other terms remain unaffected , this implies the modification does not alter the late - time steady - state solution , where @xmath46 , but only changes the _ timescale _ on which this solution is achieved . on practical grounds ,",
    "we multiply ( [ eq : radif ] ) by @xmath47 , which implies replacing @xmath48 for @xmath49 in the radiation matter coupling , and attenuating the diffusion term by a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "this illustrates how the method works to weaken the stiffness of the diffusion term . to explicitly integrate ( [ eq : radif ] )",
    ", we employ the second - order accurate runge - kutta - legendre ( rkl2 ) super - time - stepping scheme @xcite , that is already used for the updates of the other parabolic terms ( such as , viscosity , thermal conduction , resistive and ambipolar diffusion ) in the code .",
    "[ sec : patankar ]    even with the reduced speed , @xmath42 , the radiation - matter - coupling term @xmath51 can itself contribute a severe timestep constraint in regions of high opacity , where the coupling becomes stiff .",
    "ignoring , for the moment , the diffusion term in ( [ eq : radif ] ) , the coupling amounts to an ordinary differential equation , similar to production / destruction equations that are common in other fields of science .",
    "while these are typically solved by explicit runge - kutta ( rk ) methods , higher order predictor / corrector schemes do not typically guarantee positivity or conservation of , in our case , the energy @xmath52 .",
    "there however exists a class of modified rk methods @xcite that employ the so - called patankar trick  an implicit weighting of the production / destruction terms with the ratio of the evolved quantity before and after the update .",
    "it can be shown that for a single - step update , such a weighting precludes that negative values are obtained . moreover , since the weighting factors are overall symmetric , conservation is guaranteed .",
    "specifically , we use the mprk scheme given by eqn .",
    "( 27 ) in ref .",
    "the resulting update is formally implicit , but can algebraically be manipulated into fully explicit form , that is , @xmath53 for the predictor step , and @xmath54\\ ] ] for the corrector step , where @xmath55 is the forward - euler predictor value of @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the time - averaged state . , and @xmath10 . ]",
    "compared to implicit methods , that demand iterative root - finding , or so - called @xmath58-schemes ( see , e.g. , section  3.4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the method presented here offers a relatively inexpensive , parameter - free non - iterative alternative .",
    "our existing global disk models @xcite have either assumed a locally - isothermal temperature @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being the cylindrical radius from the star , or have used an adiabatic equation of state with a newtonian cooling term in the energy equation that reinstated the @xmath61 profile on a specified timescale ( typically a short fraction of the local orbital period ) .    compared to this ,",
    "even relatively basic models @xcite of dust absorption and re - radiation of star light in the disk surface , obtain a much more complex temperature structure within the ppd  with superheated surface layers and cool interiors . to account for such effects ,",
    "we include a frequency - integrated radially attenuated irradiation flux @xmath62 from the central star with effective temperature @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , and where the optical depth , @xmath65 is obtained by integrating along radial rays .",
    "following previous work , we obtain the irradiation energy source term @xmath22 by computing the negative divergence of ( [ eq : firr ] ) over each grid cell . in regions of low optical depth",
    ", we use the integral formulation @xmath66 with @xmath67 instead , as this formulation has been found to produce a more accurate solution on the discretized mesh , when differences across cells are small .",
    "to verify our implementation of the radiation - matter - coupling term , we have performed a simple one - zone model @xcite , where the thermal energy density , @xmath68 , is initially out of balance with the radiation energy density @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_coupling ] , we show three cases with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , which all converge to the same final equilibrium state . for the purpose of plotting the curves ,",
    "we have limited the timestep artificially to sample timescales shorter than the radiative equilibration timescale .",
    "we have , however , tested that even for numerical time steps somewhat larger than the coupling timescale the scheme remains stable , as expected from the implicit - like integration scheme ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : patankar ] ) that we use .    , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : rm_coupling ] ]    a standard test case for assessing the interplay of the radiation - matter - coupling with the radiation diffusion are radiative shocks , for which there exist semi - analytic solutions in simplified situations @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] , we plot the solution of the @xmath76 case from ref .",
    "@xcite , using @xmath77 grid cells in the @xmath78  direction , as well as two levels of adaptive mesh refinement ( triggered by gradients in the thermal energy , @xmath68 ) , which are shown as gray shaded areas in the plot . as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] , apart from the shock location ( which has been shifted by @xmath79 with respect to the semi - analytic solution ) , all quantities agree to within @xmath80 accuracy .",
    "we have also successfully performed the harder @xmath81 test , which we omit here for brevity .",
