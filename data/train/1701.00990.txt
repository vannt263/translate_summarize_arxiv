    "hitherto , the main exoplanet detection technique relies on spectroscopic and photometric transits . if a planet passes in front of a star , the star will be partially eclipsed and its flux will be dimmed by the successive coverage and uncoverage of the stellar surface by the transiting planet , resulting in detectable dips in the stellar light curve . in the optical and infrared bands , where most of the transit detection occurred ,",
    "those transit depths are of the order of 13% , e.g. , 1.6% for hd  209458b @xcite , and 2.45% for hd  189733b @xcite .",
    "if the photospheric disk has a uniform emission ( i.e. , there is no limb - darkening ) , these depths are equal to the square of the ratio of the exoplanet radius ( @xmath4 ) to the stellar radius ( @xmath5 ) . from multi - wavelength light curves ,",
    "it becomes possible to characterize the atmosphere and exosphere of giant exoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but additional measurements are needed to estimate the mass of the planet , the orbital parameters , and the inclination angle .",
    "these results can be achieved thanks to radial velocity measurements , orbital brightness modulations , gravitational microlensing , direct imaging , astrometry , and polarimetry .",
    "the later is probably one of the most delicate methods since the anticipated white light polarization degree ( about 10@xmath6 , @xcite ) resulting from scattering of stellar photons onto the atmospheric layers of hot jupiters is expected to be just about detectable given the current limits of current optical , broad - band , stellar polarimeters @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported to have successfully achieved a @xmath7-band polarimetric detection of hd  189733b and found a peak polarization of 2@xmath810@xmath9 ( i.e. 0.02  % ) and a cosine - shaped distribution of polarization over the orbital period . from those results , @xcite inferred additional constraints on the size of the scattering atmosphere of hd  189733b , and on the orientation of the system with respect to the earth - primary line of sight . yet there is no reliable measurement of the true scattered light polarization from hd  189733b in the @xmath7-band , as @xcite and @xcite reported an absence of large amplitude polarization variations .",
    "even if their observations are consistent with a plausible polarization amplitude from the planet , the low significance of the polarimetric observations can not be used as a claim for detection .",
    "this highlights the difficulty of _ polarimetric _ measurements of exoplanets in the optical band .",
    "however , _ spectroscopic _ detection of exoplanets has been quite successful at all wavebands , except at x - rays energies .",
    "it is unfortunate since x - ray photometry , spectroscopy , and polarimetry could help to constrain the composition and morphology of the exoplanet s atmosphere .",
    "@xcite reported for hd  189733 the detection in the 0.252  kev energy band of a transit depth estimate ranging from 4.0@xmath102.7% to 7.3@xmath102.5% ( see in their table  6 the limb - brightened model ) , which might be larger than the transit depth in optical of 2.391@xmath100.001% , computed for a uniformly emitting disk using the planetary radius of @xcite .",
    "these values of transit depths in x - rays were obtained by fitting the x - ray broad - band light curve using the analytic chromospheric transit of @xcite that assumes a geometrically thin emission .",
    "however , the corona of the sun ( a normal star ) is by definition located above the chromosphere and the solar coronal plasma is extended above the photosphere ( see for a review on the solar corona , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , therefore , a zero thickness is not appropriate to describe the geometry of the corona of hd  189733a , a moderately active star .",
    "moreover , the normalized phase - folded x - ray light curve of hd  189733a is affected for a phase binning of 0.005 ( corresponding to 958  s ) by large statistical noise ( @xmath05% ; poisson noise from added - up raw count rate out transit in table  5 of @xcite ) and astrophysical ( white noise ) scatter ( @xmath04% ; see bottom right panel of fig .",
    "12 in the appendix of @xcite ) that hinders any fitting .",
    "therefore , more sensitive x - ray observations of the transit of hd  189733b are mandatory to obtain an accurate measurement of the shape of the planetary transit of the corona of hd  189733a and to better constrain its maximum depth .    in any case , the first indirect detection of an extra - solar planet in the 0.1  10  kev energy range opens new questions : what is the expected x - ray absorption radius and scattered flux from giant exoplanets ? is a _",
    "direct _ detection of giant exoplanets feasible in this energy band ? is , similarly to the optical band , a polarimetric detection within the reach of future instruments ? to solve those issues ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate the host - star flux reprocessed by the exoplanet gaseous surface first , and then to compute the resulting scattering - induced polarization .",

    "the extension and depth of the coronal transit is modified by the variations with energy of the coronal emission profile , the photon extinction cross - section ( determining the absorption radius ) , and the observed stellar flux .",

    "the flux reprocessed onto the atmospheric layers of hd  189733b strongly depends on the angle between the source , the exoplanet atmosphere and the observer ; this effect is due to the differential scattering phase function of incoherent scattering , as presented in fig .",

    "the middle panel of fig  [ fig : results ] is a visualization of the linear continuum polarization degree @xmath178 , ranging from 0 ( unpolarized ) to 100  % ( fully polarized ) .",
    "it is the polarization resulting from scattered light only , i.e. not diluted by the unpolarized stellar flux .",

    ", we find polarization maximums close to orbital phases @xmath190 , i.e. , near planetary greatest elongations , with @xmath178 = 64.9@xmath102.9  % which is slightly larger than in infrared . since the planet s orbital plane is inclined by 4@xmath19 , the polarization degree does not drop to zero at zero orbital phase as a small fraction of photons scatters onto the top of the atmospheric layers towards the earth .",
    "hence , we are sure that our model produces correct results and extends the near - infrared / optical investigation of @xcite to x - ray energies .",
    "the fourth panel of fig  [ fig : results ] also shows the star+planet linear polarization , now taking into account polarization dilution by the unpolarized stellar photons , i.e. , @xmath191 .",
    "the overall shape of the polarization curve , associated with a polarization degree below 0.003  % , is quite different from the intrinsic @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , maximum polarization is found when the exoplanet transits behind the plane - of - the - sky , with a local diminution to zero when hd  189733b is occulted by its primary star .",
    "the departure from a purely sinusoidal waveform is again due to the scattering phase function of incoherent scattering that promotes backscattering .",
    "associated with maximum fluxes from hd  189733b that are not located at maximal planetary elongations , the net diluted polarization degree peaks at orbital phases + 0.35 and + 0.65 .",
    "the highest degrees of @xmath178 are of the order of 0.0025  @xmath10  0.0002  % at 0.7  kev , similarly to the polarization found in the optical band @xcite .",

    "when hd  189733b does not transit on hd  189733a , its polarization angle is equal to 90@xmath19 ( the @xmath192-vector of the radiation is aligned with the projected rotational axis of the orbit ) .",
    "however , when the planet is about to transit in front of its primary star , @xmath180 oscillates around 90@xmath19 .",
    "the canceling contribution of unpolarized fluxes from the star and the 90@xmath19 oriented polarization position angle resulting from scattering prevent the @xmath180 value from stabilizing , resulting in a chaotic signal .",
    "this behavior is strengthened due to the edge - on orientation of the exoplanet s orbit . as the illuminated side of hd  189733b , producing the scattering - induced polarization signal , is facing the star , an observer situated on earth no longer detects the bright side of the atmosphere and the signal is almost canceled . only photons that have scattered on the top of the atmosphere carry a non - random polarization signal . since most of the radiation comes from hd  189733a , the resulting polarization signal is highly diluted and thus @xmath180 randomly oscillates .",
    "another variation of @xmath180 is detected when the planet passes behind hd  189733a : at the ingress ( egress ) point , the polarization position angle increases ( decreases ) by @xmath0  30@xmath19 , due to the partial obscuration of the reprocessing target .",
    "the inclination of the system and the partial obscuration of the planetary disk suppresses the averaging of polarization and results in @xmath180 variations before a pure cancellation of polarization due to the planet disappearance .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuation of @xmath180 is directly correlated with the orbital inclination of the exoplanet and could be , in principle , used to estimate the impact parameter of the transit .",
    "we presented the first quantification of the amount of x - ray flux reprocessed by the hot jupiter exoplanet hd  189733b , along with the first estimation of the net polarization a future x - ray polarimeter could detect .",
    "we find that the 0.7  kev flux of hd  189733b is three to five orders of magnitude lower than its primary main sequence k1.5  v star , depending on the orbital phase of the exoplanet . considering a stellar flux of 2.9@xmath810@xmath193erg  @xmath53  s@xmath14 at 0.7  kev and at a distance of 19.45  pc",

    ", one can only look for flux modulation with orbital phase . as a guideline",
    ", we can use a threshold @xmath196 of the planetary relative flux , @xmath197 , to divide the x - ray observation of @xmath186 planetary orbits ( of period @xmath178 in seconds ) in two parts . during the orbital phase @xmath198 , where @xmath197 is lower than @xmath196 , the x - ray count rate of hd  189733 is @xmath199 with @xmath200 the count rate of the host star and @xmath201 the average planetary relative flux on @xmath198 . during the orbital phase @xmath202 , where @xmath197 is larger than @xmath196 , the x - ray count rate of hd  189733 is @xmath203 , with @xmath204 the average increase of the relative planetary flux .",
    "the increase of count rate @xmath205 is statistically significant if @xmath206 with @xmath207 and assuming poisson noise @xmath208 . straightforward algebra leads to :    @xmath209    using @xmath210  pn  count  s@xmath14 ( sect .  [ model : corona ] ) , we find a minimum value of @xmath211 orbits for @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 . since the needed accuracy requires a total exposure time of 81  years , the modulation of the x - ray flux with the orbital phase can not be observed .",
    "[ fig : results ] shows that the continuum polarization degree resulting from the interaction of stellar photons with the inner layers of the hd  189733b s atmosphere is very low , ranging from 0 to 0.003  % . due to strong dilution by the unpolarized primary source",
    ", this level of polarization corresponds to an amplitude of @xmath0  10@xmath9 .",

    "we have estimated that the maximum transit depth is little sensitive to the metal abundance .",
    "since the maximum depth of the x - ray transit of hd  189733b estimated from the current modeling of its atmosphere is small , forthcoming deeper observations with the current x - ray observatories may not have the required x - ray sensitivity to accurately constrain the transit shape .",

    "<S> thousands of exoplanets have been detected , but only one exoplanetary transit was potentially observed in x - rays from hd  189733a . </S>",
    "<S> what makes the detection of exoplanets so difficult in this band ? to answer this question , we run monte - carlo radiative transfer simulations to estimate the amount of x - ray flux reprocessed by hd  189733b despite its extended evaporating - atmosphere , we find that the x - ray absorption radius of hd  189733b at 0.7  kev , the mean energy of the photons detected in the 0.252 kev energy band by xmm - newton , is @xmath01.01 times the planetary radius for an atmosphere of atomic hydrogen and helium ( including ions ) , and produces a maximum depth of @xmath02.1% at @xmath0@xmath1  min from the center of the planetary transit on the geometrically thick and optically thin corona . </S>",
    "<S> we compute numerically in the 0.252  kev energy band that this maximum depth is only of @xmath01.6% at @xmath0@xmath2  min from the transit center , and little sensitive to the metal abundance assuming that adding metals in the atmosphere would not dramatically change the density - temperature profile . regarding a direct detection of hd  189733b in x - rays , we find that the amount of flux reprocessed by the exoplanetary atmosphere varies with the orbital phase , spanning between 35 orders of magnitude fainter than the flux of the primary star . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the degree of linear polarization emerging from hd 189733b is @xmath30.003% , with maximums detected near planetary greatest elongations . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that both the modulation of the x - ray flux with the orbital phase and the scattered - induced continuum polarization can not be observed with current x - ray facilities . </S>"
