    "the question of when a manifold @xmath0 is homeomorphic ( or diffeomorphic ) to a real algebraic set @xmath1 is an old one .",
    "if we start with an imbedding @xmath2 and insist on finding an algebraic subset @xmath1 of @xmath3 which is isotopic to @xmath0 in @xmath3 , the problem encounters additional difficulties coming from complexification .",
    "hence it is natural to break the question into two parts : ( 1 ) stable : if @xmath0 homeomorphic ( or diffeomorphic ) to some real algebraic set .",
    "( 2 ) ambient : if @xmath0 isotopic to a real algebraic subset in @xmath3 .",
    "while the first problem has a complete solution , the second one has many interesting obstructions .",
    "here we give a quick summary of some of the related results .",
    "clearly this brief survey is by no means complete , and it is biased towards author s interest in the field . for the basics reader can consult to the book @xcite .",
    "by @xcite and @xcite every closed smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to a nonsingular real algebraic set , and by @xcite every closed pl manifold is homemorphic to real algebraic set .",
    "also if @xmath4 is a closed smooth submanifold of a nonsingular variety @xmath1 , we can ask whether @xmath0 can be made algebraic in @xmath5 for some large k .",
    "the complete solution of this is also known , to explain this we first need some definitions : we call a homology cycle of @xmath1 _ algebraic _ if it is represented by a real algebraic subset . for example",
    ", it is known that all the steifel - whitney and pontryagin classes of @xmath1 are represented by algebraic cycles @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the subgroup of @xmath7 generated by the real algebraic subsets .",
    "we call a real algebraic set _ totally algebraic _ if @xmath8 .",
    "cleary @xmath3 is totally algebraic , and the ( unoriented ) grassmannians @xmath9 of @xmath10 planes in @xmath3 are totally algebraic @xcite ( because its homology is generated by the schubert cycles which are algebraic subsets ) .",
    "( @xcite ) every closed smooth submanifold @xmath11 of a real algebraic set @xmath1 is isotopic to a real algebraic subset in @xmath12 for some large @xmath10 if and only if @xmath1 is totally algebraic . @xmath13    it should be noted that not every closed smooth manifold @xmath1 is diffeomorphic to a nonsingular totally algebraic set @xcite , but surprisingly every closed smooth @xmath1 is homeomorphic to a totally algebraic set @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "evidently the singularities of @xmath14 is related to the obstructions arising from @xcite .",
    "( @xcite ) every closed smooth submanifold @xmath15 is @xmath16 -isotopic to nonsingular points of an algebraic subset @xmath17 .",
    "that is @xmath0 is isotoping to a topological component @xmath18 of a real algebraic set @xmath1 which is nonsingular , and the other components @xmath19 are smaller dimensional .    here",
    "@xmath16 - isotopy means arbitrarily small isotopy . in the proof of the above theorem one can arrange so that the extra components @xmath20 are arbitrarily far away from @xmath21",
    "also this theorem implies that any @xmath2 is @xmath16 - isotopic to a nonsingular algebraic subset @xmath22 .",
    "this is because if @xmath23 and @xmath24 for some polynomials @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then we can take @xmath27    there is also a more sophisticated version of this theorem for immersed submanifolds , to explain it we need some definitions : recall that the thom construction associates an imbedding of any closed smooth manifold @xmath28 and element in the homotopy group of the thom space @xmath29\\in\\pi_{m+k}(mo_{k})$ ] , which classifies imbeddings up to cobordism in @xmath30 $ ] . in the more general case of @xmath31",
    "is an immersion , thom construction gives an element in the homotopy group of the iterated loop space suspension @xmath29\\in\\pi_{m+k}(\\omega^{\\infty}\\sigma^{\\infty } mo_{k})$ ] ; this is a group which classifies immersions up to immersed cobordisms in @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath32 be the subgroup generated by the cobordism classes of ` almost nonsingular ' algebraic subsets .",
    "we call an algebraic subset of @xmath33 an _ almost nonsingular algebraic subset _ if it is an image of a smoothly immersed manifold @xmath34 , and each sheet of the immersion is nonsingular . in particular",
    "if @xmath31 is an imbedding , then the almost nonsingular algebraic set corresponding to @xmath31 is a nonsingular algebraic subset .",
    "now we can state :    ( @xcite)an immersed closed smooth manifold @xmath35 is @xmath16- isotopic to an almost nonsingular algebraic subset of @xmath3 if and only if @xmath36\\in \\pi_{m+k}^{alg } ( \\omega^{\\infty}\\sigma^{\\infty } mo_{k})$ ] .    in particular , if an imbedding of a closed smooth manifold @xmath37 is cobordant through immersions to a closed smooth submanifold @xmath38 , then it is isotopic to a nonsingular algebraic subset .",
    "this is because , by the remarks following theorem 2 , @xmath39 is @xmath16-isotopic to a nonsingular algebraic subset of @xmath3 , then by theorem 3 we can isotope @xmath0 to a nonsingular algebraic subset of @xmath3 .",
    "so the relevant topological question is whether we can cobord @xmath15 into a lower dimensional subspace of @xmath3 :    \\(i ) when the normal bundle of @xmath2 splits a trivial line bundle ?",
    "\\(ii ) when @xmath40 $ ] lies in the image of the suspension map @xmath41 ?",
    "@xmath42    answering the first question would give conditions when @xmath0 immerses into @xmath43 , answering the second second question would help us decide if @xmath0 is cobordant to a submanifold of @xmath43 . ideally one would hope to reduce the answers to the conditions on characteristic classes of the normal bundle of @xmath0 , then ( ii ) would be sufficient conditions isotoping @xmath15 to a nonsingular real algebraic subset .",
    "surprisingly , we still do nt know whether a closed smooth submanifold @xmath44 is isotopic to a ( singular or nonsingular ) real algebraic subset ( though we came close to answering this in the affirmative in section 2 ) .",
    "so one can try to find obstructions .",
    "currently this can only be achieved either by relaxing the condition of smoothness of @xmath0 ( this section ) , or by strengthening the notion of non - singularity ( section 4 ) .",
    "underlying topological space of every algebraic set is a stratified space ( a polyhedron in particular ) , so it is natural to generalize the above questions from smooth manifolds to stratified subspaces of @xmath3 .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) _ there is a stratified space @xmath45 which is homeomorphic to an algebraic set , but can not be isotopic to an algebraic subsets of @xmath46 . _    to explain this , we need to review the general program of topologically characterizing real algebraic sets , in particular we need to recall some topologically defined structures ( ` topological resolution tower structures ' ) on stratified spaces , which enable us to identify the obstructions of making stratified spaces homeomorphic to algebraic sets .",
    "these structures on stratified sets give a topological model for algebraic sets .    in @xcite a topological characterization program for real algebraic sets is introduced , here is a brief summary : just like an algebraic number such as @xmath47 is determined by a pair of integers and a monomial @xmath48 ( integers are glued by a monomial ) , an algebraic set @xmath1 is determined by a collection of nonsingular algebraic sets and a collection of `` compatible '' monomial maps between them @xmath49 , and @xmath1 is obtained by gluing these nonsingular @xmath50 s by monomial @xmath51 s .",
    "we denote this by @xmath52 @xmath53 ( e.g. figure 2 is obtained by gluing an @xmath54 and two copies of @xmath55 together by a fold map ) this result is obtained by resolving various strata of @xmath1 .",
    "these objects @xmath49 are called _ algebraic resolution towers_. by imitating this , we can define analogous objects in the topological category @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are smooth manifolds and @xmath51 are certain topological version of monomial maps between them . as in ( 1 ) , by gluing the objects of @xmath58 by its maps",
    "we obtain certain stratified spaces @xmath59 , called _ topological resolution towers_. we have the following categories of sets :    @xmath60 : algebraic resolution towers    @xmath61 : topological resolution towers    @xmath62 : realization of algebraic resolution towers    @xmath63 : realization of topological resolution towers    we have the following maps , where the vertical arrows are gluings ( and they are onto by construction ) , the horizontal right - pointing arrows are the forgetful maps , and the bottom left - pointing arrow is the important _ algebraization map _ : it is a generalized version of theorem 1 ( it turns a collection of smooth manifolds and compatible topological maps between them into nonsingular algebraic sets and compatible rational maps , such a way that gluing them gives an algebraic set ) .",
    "@xmath64 therefore the stratified sets in @xmath65 topologically characterizes the real algebraic sets in @xmath66 .",
    "also if @xmath67 denotes the category of all real algebraic sets , by the above gluing process ( 1 ) we get a surjection @xmath68 .",
    "this appears to give a complete topological characterization of all real algebraic sets .",
    "unfortunately this is not quite so . for this",
    "we need that the elements @xmath69 in the image of @xmath70 to be _ submersive _ , that is we need the maps @xmath51 to be  submersive \" on each strata .",
    "we may impose this property as the part of the definition of @xmath71 ( this makes the diagram ( 2 ) commutative ) .",
    "this property is known to exits for algebraic sets of dimension @xmath72 , and it would hold in general provided that there is a certain map version of the `` resolution of singularities theorem '' , which we do nt know if exists or whether it follows from a modification of the usual resolution of singularities theorem of hironaka @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting subclass of stratified spaces in @xmath73 , called @xmath74-_spaces _ , which behave nicely on @xmath75 manifolds .",
    "for example , their existence on @xmath75 manifolds can be reduced to an algebraic topology problem , i.e. a bundle lifting problem ( fortunately with zero obstruction ) . furthermore @xmath74- spaces are submersive elements of @xmath71 .",
    "this is why all @xmath75 manifolds are homeomorphic to real algebraic sets .",
    "( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) _ every closed @xmath75-manifold is homeomorphic to an algebraic set .",
    "_    therefore any topological obstruction for a stratified space @xmath76 to lie in @xmath73 is an obstruction @xmath76 to be isomorphic ( as stratified space ) to an algebraic set .",
    "it is already known by sullivan , that every real algebraic set must be an _ euler space _ ( a stratified set such that the link of every point has even euler characteristic ) .",
    "it turns out that in dimensions @xmath77 this is also the sufficient condition for a stratified set to be homeomorphic to an algebraic set .",
    "this is proven by showing that every @xmath78-dimensional euler spaces lie in @xmath65 ( [ ak1 - 3 ] , @xcite ) . by studying the topology of @xmath56 carefully",
    ", one can start defining inductively a sequence of characteristic numbers on @xmath79-dimensional euler spaces @xmath80 ( here @xmath81 ) @xmath82 whose vanishing is necessary and sufficient ( or just necessary ) for @xmath80 to lie in @xmath73 , where @xmath83 is the @xmath84-skeleton of @xmath80 . in our context",
    "this means that the @xmath85 dimensional links of the verticies of @xmath76 , which are already in @xmath71 , should bound in @xmath71 .",
    "roughly @xmath86 are the the cobordism characteristic numbers of @xmath85 dimensional elements of @xmath71 .    in @xcite this program",
    "was carried out in the first nontrivial case of @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out @xmath88 .",
    "in fact it was shown that @xmath89 is homeomorphic to an algebraic set if and only if its characteristic numbers @xmath90 .",
    "it goes as follows : to every @xmath91-dimensional euler space @xmath92 we associate numbers @xmath93 @xmath94 , which are number of vertices of @xmath92 whose links has @xmath95 number of points .",
    "then to @xmath92 we associate the following ( well defined after subdivision ) @xmath96-tuple number ( e.g. figure 1 ) .",
    "@xmath97    hence to the verticies of any @xmath78-dimensional euler space @xmath98 we can associated @xmath96-tuple numbers ( because their links are @xmath91-dimensional euler spaces ) . for the example of figure 2 we calculated these numbers ( and drew the links of its verticies ) .",
    "now for @xmath99 , we can associate numbers to the verticies of any @xmath100-dimensional euler space : @xmath101 by @xmath102_number of vertices ( mod 2 ) in @xmath103 , with @xmath104_. then the definition of @xmath105 is given by the following expression @xmath106    for example , if @xmath89 is the suspension of the @xmath78-dimensional euler space of figure 2 , it is not homeomorphic to an algebraic set ; while the suspension @xmath14 of the euler space in figure 3 is homeomorphic to a real algebraic set .",
    "this @xmath14 has the property mentioned in theorem 4 .",
    "more recently the  necessary \" part of this program was generalized to dimension @xmath96 by @xcite and @xcite ( where @xcite generalizes this approach , whereas @xcite uses an alternative approach ) , and also @xcite finds sufficient invariants ( not all in @xmath107 but in a larger group ) .",
    "one difficulty with this is @xmath108 grows too fast to calculate , for example @xcite shows @xmath109 .",
    "note that in examples above the euler characteristic @xmath110 @xmath96 of the link of the @xmath91-dimensional strata is generically constant .",
    "this is no coincidence , in fact it was observed in @xcite that general real algebraic varieties @xmath111 satisfy the property ( * ) : the euler characteristic @xmath112 of the link of @xmath1 in @xmath76 ( @xmath113 ) is generically constant @xmath114 ( also see @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite this property",
    "is used to show that the set @xmath115 above satisfies the second claim of theorem 4 as follows : let @xmath116 be the arc , which is the suspension of the isolated point of @xmath117 . by",
    "( * ) in any algebraic model of @xmath14 , the zariski closure of @xmath118 is a @xmath91-dimensional algebraic subset @xmath119 such that @xmath120 generically lies in the @xmath100-manifold part of @xmath14 . now",
    "if @xmath115 were an algebraic hyper - surface , we can choose a square free polynomial equation @xmath121 of @xmath122 say , @xmath31 takes signs @xmath123 on the inside and outside regions @xmath124 separated by @xmath125 .",
    "define @xmath126 then @xmath127 mod @xmath96 is not generically constant ( it is @xmath78 or @xmath84 when @xmath128 is in the interior of @xmath118 or @xmath129 ) , this violates ( * ) .",
    "if we ask whether a smooth submanifold @xmath15 is isotopic to a nonsingular real algebraic set @xmath1 in a strong sense , then we can find genuine obstructions to doing this , even when @xmath0 is already nonsingular algebraic set in @xmath3 .",
    "here nonsingular in the `` strong sense '' means @xmath1 is the real part of a nonsingular complex variety in @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is identified with one of the standard charts .",
    "( @xcite ) there are smooth submanifolds of @xmath132 which are isotopic to nonsingular real algebraic subsets , but can not be isotopic to the real parts of nonsingular complex algebraic subsets of @xmath133",
    ".    we will break the proof into small elementary steps which are mostly special cases of more general results ( e.g. @xcite ) , some of which are already mentioned in section 1 .",
    "when possible we will outline the proofs from scratch for the benefit of non - specialist .",
    "@xmath134 _ * step 1 * : grassmannians of @xmath10-planes in @xmath3 is a nonsingular real algebraic set : @xmath135 where @xmath136 denotes the @xmath137 symmetric matrices .",
    "if @xmath138 is a compact nonsingular real algebraic set , the normal ( or tangent ) gauss map @xmath139 is an entire rational map ( non - zero denominator ) . hence in particular the duals of steifel - whiney classes of @xmath1 are represented by real algebraic subsets ( since steifel - whitney classes of the universal bundle is represented by shubert cycles in @xmath140 _",
    "we can identify @xmath141 with the algebraic set defined on the right via the map @xmath142 .",
    "since nonsingular @xmath1 can be covered by finitely many zariski - open sets @xmath143 , each of which is described in @xmath3 as the zeros of @xmath10 polynomials @xmath144 , @xmath145 , whose jacobian @xmath146 has rank @xmath10 . then by standard linear algebra @xmath147 . in particular",
