    "quantum tunneling attracts much interest because of its importance for such physical systems as helium surface structures , quantum dots , superconductors , that are among the most promising for realization of large scale quantum computers .",
    "being one of the most important manifestation of quantum mechanics , tunneling process occurs in many phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "large progress has been made in description of tunneling decay when the instanton technique was applied .",
    "being a nonperturbative method , it plays a fundamental role in description of such type of processes  @xcite .",
    "it became a powerful tool in physics and has got many applications .",
    "some of the advantages of the instanton technique ( it ) could be : ( i ) stronger than standard wkb . generally , it is hard to tell whether wkb result is accurate , whereas the it is controlled by well defined expansion parameters .",
    "( ii ) no connection formulas , in some cases it is more accurate  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) non - perturbative approach .",
    "( iv ) instantons , as elementary excitations are topological objects : configurations with different number of instantons are topologically distinct . ( v )",
    "crucial importance for higher dimensional field theories .",
    "the concept of quantum tunneling of vortices in superconductors ( e.g. refs in the review  @xcite about magnetic relaxation in htscs ) first appeared when measurements of magnetic relaxation at ultralow temperatures have been made  @xcite .",
    "the experiments have shown that the relaxation rate does not disappear at zero temperature .",
    "this phenomenon was attributed to the quantum tunneling .",
    "until now it is not well understood yet . neither vortex mass nor hall coefficient are known exactly .",
    "we speculate that the vortex quantum tunneling may be also exhibited in mesoscopic superconductors due to trapping potential formed by the surface barrier .",
    "this would result in higher vortex expulsion magnetic fields than expected from pure thermodynamical considerations .    due to the magnus force affecting the vortex dynamics in superconductor ,",
    "the situation is analogous to that of a particle in magnetic field .",
    "the problem of a charged particle tunneling in presence of magnetic field has itself both theoretical and practical interest .",
    "as the tunneling is strongly affected by magnetic field , applied in transverse direction , this could be efficiently used to control qubits in possible quantum computer realizations of the future . in absence of magnetic field",
    "the decay rate is related to the imaginary part of the free energy as @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the escape rate can be found making semiclassical approximations in the euclidean path integral .",
    "the term corresponding to the ground state gives the greatest contribution to the propagator transformed to imaginary times in the limit of large time interval .",
    "it makes possible to determine the imaginary part of the ground state energy .",
    "the same considerations must be valid when the magnetic field is applied .",
    "however , because of the broken time - reversal symmetry , a complex action appears under the path integral , when transformed to euclidean space .",
    "furthermore the imaginary time trajectories which extremize the action become complex and the operator corresponding to the second variation of the action is a non - hermitian one and as a result possesses complex eigenvalues  @xcite . in this case",
    "one could make analytic continuation of the path integral to a complex coordinate space or change the time contour in the complex plane .",
    "nevertheless we show that it is possible to make analytic continuation in cyclotron frequency to transform the action to a real one .",
    "this makes the task much more transparent because of analogy with common classical mechanics where everyone has got a good physical intuition .",
    "the coincidence with the result obtained by usual wkb technique  @xcite could also serve as a proof of validity of the method . of course it makes sense to make such trick only if we consider the task analytically , rather than numerically .",
    "otherwise we could not `` return back '' to real cyclotron frequencies after having got a numerical result with the real action .",
    "normally the polar coordinates are used to study the systems that possess rotational invariance .",
    "however , it becomes hard to work with path integrals in curved coordinates , because of additional terms appearing in the action  @xcite .",
    "usually one always begins with time - sliced path integral in cartesian coordinates before transformed to the curved ones , since change of variables in path integrals is not a direct procedure . everywhere in this paper",
    "we work with path integrals written in orthogonal coordinates .",
    "the barrier near the surface of type - ii superconductors was first studied by bean and livingstone  @xcite .",
    "it arises from competition of two forces : attraction two the image antivortex near the border and interaction with the meissner current .",
    "surface roughness is believed to suppress the barrier .",
    "however , one can notice that the influence of the surface irregularities is much less pronounced for leaving the barrier than for entry  @xcite .",
    "another possible source affecting flux dynamics in htscs in transverse magnetic field is the geometrical barrier  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not exhibited in superconductors of disk form .",
    "moreover , it is expected to dominate magnetic behavior of htscs of flat non - elliptic form at elevated temperatures .",
    "there are two main forces affecting vortex dynamics in superconductors : magnus ( hall ) force and dissipation .",
    "feigelman et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the magnus force is dominant in clean superconductors , while other authors  @xcite argued that the vortex tunneling may occur in an intermediate regime .",
    "as long as we consider the htscs , the dissipative term must not be crucial because of small coherence lengths ( as well as vortex cores ) .",
    "indeed , the evidence for a low dissipation regime in cuprate superconductors has been presented by  @xcite .",
    "the same authors  @xcite argued that the magnus force is also smaller than standard estimates  @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass of vortex can be relevant to the low - temperature physics of clean htscs in superclean limit  @xcite and should be taken into account in our model . in 1965",
    "two contributions to the vortex mass were calculated by suhl  @xcite : due to the kinetic energy of the vortex core and due to electromagnetic energy . recently",
    ", chudnovsky and kuklov  @xcite have shown that transversal displacements of the crystal lattice can give a significant contribution to the vortex mass .",
    "this contribution must be crucial in metals with high concentration of superconducting electrons . in our case of small coherence lenght @xmath1 , the most important contribution to",
    "the mass arises from the quantization of the electron states inside the vortex core ( the same paper  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown to exceed the core mass by the factor @xmath2 ( refs [ 7 - 9 ] in  @xcite ) .",

    ", then the asymptotics of the integral when @xmath29 is given by the contribution of the saddle points @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 , if @xmath32 is close enough to @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to make generalization of the theorem cited above in the case of path integrals , implying `` path integral '' instead of `` n - dimensional integral '' and `` trajectory '' instead of `` n - dimensional stationary point '' .",
    "we have only one parameter @xmath20 instead of the set of parameters @xmath22 and the condition @xmath28 corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "but we have a real solution of the equation of motion at @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from the theorem that the asymptotics of the path integral is given by the same analytic formula inside some circle around @xmath34 on the complex plane .",
    "thus if we calculate that one for which the stationary trajectories are real ones , the asymptotics inside all the circle can be found by continuation in @xmath20 .    to have even more basis",

    "thus at least for small @xmath20 we can reduce the stationary point ( steepest - descent ) method to that of laplace , which is more simple . as a result all the equations are real and the instanton trajectories correspond to that ones of a classical particle moving in the inverted potential with a transverse magnetic field .",
    "taking into account the considerations above and making transformation to imaginary times @xmath17 as well as @xmath39 ( in fact the sign in the last procedure must not be the matter ) we get the following lagrangian : @xmath40        the trajectories extremizing the action corresponding to this lagrangian are that ones , which correspond to a classical particle moving in the inverted potential @xmath41 and transverse magnetic field applied in the same direction as before .",
    "now we are going to make a little step back from the promise to work in cartesian coordinates and find the classical trajectories from the equations of motion written in polar coordinates .",
    "thus : @xmath42 equations of motion : @xmath43 @xmath44 we consider the limit @xmath45 as usual for description of ground state decay in the instanton approach .",
    "the classical trajectories that give the greatest contribution to the path integral are that ones , that spend almost all their time at the origin , as the action is zero there .",
    "this gives @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider the first equation of motion and the energy conservation law : @xmath43 @xmath47 because the trajectory comes from the center of the system , @xmath48 gives @xmath49 .",
    "suppose the opposite .",
    "then at least @xmath50 when @xmath48 .",
    "obviously this contradicts to the energy conservation law as the potential tends to zero under this limit .",
    "hence @xmath51 and the equations of motion transform to : @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the solution of this equation is : @xmath54 it corresponds to the instanton with the center at @xmath55 .",
    "there are many other classical trajectories with different positions of the centers .",
    "obviously , all of them have the same action : @xmath56 we will take them into account when taking integral over time zero - mode below .",
    "also , there are trajectories with the same position in time , but differing from each other by rotation around the origin .",
    "similarly , these ones will be counted by the integral over @xmath57-mode below .",
    "the instanton trajectory transformed to cartesian coordinates reads : @xmath58 where @xmath59 plays a role of the `` lifetime '' of the instanton , @xmath60 is the frequency of rotation around the center .",
    "for instance , when @xmath61 the instanton makes approximately one turn during his `` life '' , while for bigger @xmath60 the trajectories become spirals spinning around the center ( although in this considerations @xmath20 is not small already , still it is worthwhile to consider such trajectories by the reasons given below ) .",
    "let us calculate the contribution of quantum fluctuations near the classical trajectories .",

    "we can fix the one corresponding to @xmath63 .",
    "the other classical trajectories , as well as the fluctuations around them , will be taken into account later integrating over the rotation symmetry group .    in the semiclassical approximation",

    "an arbitrary quantum deviation can be decomposed through normalized eigenfunctions @xmath72 of the operator @xmath66 : @xmath73 substitution to the path integral leads to the gaussian integrations over the coefficients  @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes product of the eigenvalues of @xmath66 omitting the zero eigenvalues @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the negative one @xmath79 .",
    "they require special treatment and we will pay attention to them in the next sections .",

    "now we begin with evaluation of @xmath86 .    the system of four differential equations of the second order   written for the lagrangian   decouples into two subsystems , each one of the form : @xmath91 or in terms of the operator @xmath66 introduced above : @xmath92 the boundary conditions are : @xmath93 for the first subsystem ( for which @xmath94 ) , and @xmath95 for the second one ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "let us find 4 independent solutions of the system .",
    "two solutions of this problem are the zero eigenmodes , corresponding to the @xmath97- and @xmath57-symmetries .",
    "they can be easily found by differentiating the classical trajectory   with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath62 .",

    "there are two more solutions left .",
    "it could seem sophisticated to find them , however we will use the following trick .",
    "suppose we deal with a 1-dimensional case .",
    "if one solution of the second order homogeneous differential equation ( written in the liouville form ) is : @xmath100 then the second one can be found as ( for example  @xcite or  @xcite-2.7.4 ) : @xmath101 and if @xmath102 the second one is @xmath103 the idea to take the anzats in the similar form multiplied by sines or cosines turns out to be successful . indeed , making a straightforward substitution of functions @xmath104",

    "let us analyze the properties of this 4 independent solutions .",
    "it is easy to note that : @xmath106 @xmath107 these important properties will be used in future for further calculations .",
    "at last we are able to find the solution of the system , satisfying the desired boundary conditions   and  . expanding @xmath108 we get the coefficients @xmath109 for the vector @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "now let us look at their behavior in the limit @xmath45 . for simplicity we can choose @xmath9 in such a way that @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "obviously , the final result must not depend on our specific choice of @xmath9 , hence choosing @xmath9 in this way we get significant simplification : @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xmath118 bearing this in mind we rewrite our coefficients in the following asymptotic form : @xmath119 @xmath120 finally , the determinant @xmath86 can be found : @xmath121",
    "now we need to get rid of the zero eigenvalues in the determinant @xmath86 .",
    "this could be done by several ways .",
    "one could introduce eigenvalue @xmath122 as a small parameter , perturbating the system of differential equations and take the limit @xmath123 of the determinator divided by @xmath124 at the end ( as we have two zero eigenvalues ) .",
    "note , that this limit must be taken _",
    "after _ the limit @xmath45 , as the zero eigenvalues are not exactly zero but tend to it as an exponential of @xmath9 .",
    "however this requires the precision at least @xmath125 .",
    "thus it seems more convenient to eliminate @xmath77 and @xmath78 separately using the boundary perturbation method , just looking at the behavior of this eigenvalues at large @xmath9 .",
    "as was mentioned above we must expect exponential dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "consider the green function : @xmath126 the reason to introduce the minus sign into the definition will be clear below : we will receive just the same boundary conditions for the system of differential equations that was solved earlier .",
    "the boundary conditions for the green function are : @xmath127 then the general solution of @xmath128 is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath131 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath77 and @xmath132 can be calculated requiring @xmath133 and @xmath134 to be strictly zero ( note , that the zero modes that we have found early do not satisfy this boundary conditions exactly for finite values of @xmath9 , but only in the limit @xmath45 ) .",
    "this leads to the following conditions : @xmath135 where we have made the born approximation substituting @xmath136 by @xmath130 inside the integral as @xmath137 is small .",
    "first let us find @xmath138 .",
    "then the solution of homogeneous system can be expressed via @xmath57- zero mode and other solutions as : @xmath139 and the boundary conditions become @xmath140 in the last formula the corrections were neglected inside the integral , as they give less contribution than @xmath141 ( more strictly one can find the values of the coefficients from the equations below , substitute them into this integral and prove that it is indeed the case ) .",
    "taking the same @xmath9 , chosen so that @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we get : @xmath142    note , that we have the products of two functions of @xmath143 inside the integral , that are either even or odd  .",
    "thus only that terms contribute , that consist of functions , both even or odd at the same time . using the explicit form the green function from the next section   we get the following expression for the integral : @xmath144",
    "the two equations from which the desired eigenvalue can be determined are : @xmath145 in the limit of large @xmath9 this leads to ( see appendix ) : @xmath146    using the same procedure we find the second zero - eigenvalue @xmath78 .",
    "decomposing the solution of the homogeneous system as @xmath147 we write the boundary condition : @xmath148 eventually , we get : @xmath149 note , that @xmath78 has the same form as for the 1-dimensional case  @xcite ( there @xmath150 and the operator , for which the eigenvalue is calculated is defined two times smaller than our @xmath151 ) , but the frequency @xmath71 is dependent on magnetic field now : @xmath152 .",
    "the green function , satisfying   and   has the next matrix form : @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",
    "the equation   splits into two independent subsystems : @xmath155 and @xmath156 with zero initial conditions following from   for both of them .",
    "consider the first one .",
    "it corresponds to the homogeneous system considered above in the regions @xmath157 and @xmath158 . in that terms : @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "both `` left '' and `` right '' solutions must be connected in such a way , that the delta function comes out . if we integrate the system over a small interval with the joint inside : @xmath161 as @xmath1 and @xmath162 are continuous on the joint , the last terms at the left hand sides of the equations tend to zero . obviously , the solution in the `` left '' region ( @xmath157 ) is the trivial one : @xmath163",
    ". thus we get the initial conditions for the `` right '' one : @xmath164 together with two other conditions coming from the continuity on the border of two regions , we have : @xmath165 with the replacement @xmath166 this boundary conditions exactly coincide with   ( and   for the second subsystem ) .",
    "thus the coefficients ( that actually are functions of @xmath143 ) : @xmath167 @xmath168 hence the green function becomes @xmath169 using the asymptotic forms   for @xmath170 we have : @xmath171",
    "having found the determinator @xmath86 and the zero eigenvalues , the integrals over zero modes left to be evaluated explicitly , as they require special treatment . recall that the @xmath57- and @xmath97- modes were found differentiating the classical trajectory @xmath172 .",
    "we can express @xmath173 through these modes : @xmath174\\ ] ] @xmath175 so that : @xmath176 this teylor series needs to be compared with our expansion   over the normalized eigenfunction of the operator @xmath66 : @xmath177 where the zero eigenmodes were extracted from the sum explicitly . in order to complete the integration over the zero modes , the integrals over the coefficients @xmath178 , @xmath179",
    "must be transformed to the integrals over angular and time positions .",
    "the expressions above make clear the procedure of changing variables from @xmath178 , @xmath179 to @xmath57 , @xmath97 : @xmath180 the jacobian of this transformation is : @xmath181 where we have have substituted @xmath182 and @xmath183 , found to be ( see appendix ) : latexmath:[\\[||\\vec\\varphi_1||=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\omega } } \\quad \\text{and } \\quad     let us pay attention to the negative eigenvalue .",
    "physical intuition tells that there must be only one negative eigenmode , corresponding to the direction in the functional space associated with escape of the particle .",
    "one can use also oscillation theorems to determine how many eigenvalues less than @xmath78 and @xmath77 left . for one - dimensional shroedinger equation",
    "this is nothing but number of nodes of the eigenfunction that tells its position number in the ordered series of corresponding eigenvalues @xmath185 .",
    "we have managed with the negative eigenvalue just as it was done in one - dimensional case ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "there an analytical continuation of the gaussian integral over negative eigenmode has been used .",
    "a special feature is the factor @xmath186 , arising from a half of the gaussian peak .",
    "the integration over the other half axis turns out to be fake .",
    "thus the contribution of the negative eigenmode integral is : @xmath187 the sign here depends on how the analytical continuation is done . in future",
    "we will omit this sign as it is not important .",
    "the precise value of @xmath79 is not important also as it cancel with @xmath79 in the formula for the ratio of the determinants  .",
    "eventually , @xmath188 we will retain this integrals unsolved for some time . note , that the integration over the angular variable @xmath57 appears _ naturally _ from the integration over @xmath178 along the direction in the functional space corresponding to the @xmath57-symmetry zero mode .",
    "this is nothing to do with path integral written in polar coordinates , for which an additional care must be taken .",
    "the determinant @xmath87 of the jacobi fields along the trivial trajectory @xmath189 is estimated by analogy with @xmath86 .",
    "the calculation is rather simple now .",
    "@xmath190 so that the system @xmath191 reads : @xmath192 with the same boundary conditions   and  . the system can be solved by standard methods .",
    "we only write the final answer for the determinants of the jacobi fields in case of the pure parabolic potential : @xmath193",
    "finally , substituting the determinants and eigenvalues found above to   and  , we obtain the contribution of one instanton trajectory ( more strictly of a group of equivalent instantons with different time and angular positions , as we have integrated over the zero modes already ) : @xmath194^{-1/2 }   \\frac{i}{2\\sqrt{-\\lambda_{- } } } \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\sqrt{3}\\alpha } \\int_0^{2\\pi } d\\phi \\int_{-t}^{t } d\\tau= e^{-s_{cl } } k \\int_0^{2\\pi } d\\phi \\int_{-t}^{t } d\\tau\\ ] ] with @xmath195 we must also take into account the contribution of the multi - instanton trajectories .",
    "also , we must integrate over their positions both in time and angular space .",
    "thus @xmath196 represents the contribution of a trajectory with @xmath197 instantons distributed in the time interval @xmath198 and arbitrary directed with respect to the angular coordinate .",
    "finally , we must sum all the contributions to get the survival amplitude : @xmath199 thus the probability decay rate is : @xmath200 this simple expression is just that one , that we were looking for . to complete the calculation",
    "we must transform back to the real cyclotron frequencies @xmath201 , so that the frequency @xmath71 becomes a square root of the sum now : @xmath202 .",
    "we can rewrite the formula   in the following way using the expression for the classical action  : @xmath203 the factor @xmath204 has appeared twice here , just as much as the number of zero modes .",
    "this is a common situation in the instanton technique ( e.g. coleman , `` aspects of symmetry ''  @xcite p.337 gets 4 factors @xmath204 in case of four zero modes ) .",
    "now we will get the same result using different method .",
    "even the way , in what we deal with the magnetic field is different here .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to our initial system   is : @xmath205 using the same gauge @xmath10 , it can be rewritten as follows : @xmath206 where @xmath207 is angular momentum operator : @xmath208 and we have defined @xmath209 the important point here is that @xmath210 introduced above commutes with the angular momentum : @xmath211=0 $ ] .",
    "this is because of the rotational invariance of the system , as the potential ( including the magnetic field term ) in the hamiltonian @xmath210 is a pure function of radial distance @xmath212 .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath213 , rotating the vectors in the counterclockwise direction : @xmath214 then the angular momentum operator @xmath215 generates rotations of the wave function : @xmath216 this can be seen as follows ( e.g.  @xcite p.219 ) .",
    "one can find generator of the rotation unitary group by differentiating with respect to @xmath57 : @xmath217 thus @xmath215 is indeed the generator of the unitary group of rotations .    with all this in mind",
    ", the amplitude   becomes : @xmath218 as the rotation of the state @xmath219 is equal to itself .",
    "thus the problem has reduced to finding the decay rate of the particle in the potential of the same shape with the renormalized frequency @xmath220 in absence of the magnetic field : @xmath221 shroedinger equation in polar coordinates reads : @xmath222 \\psi = e \\psi\\ ] ] with @xmath223 and @xmath224 : @xmath225 f(r)=e f(r)\\ ] ] as we are interested in the tunneling from the lowest state we take @xmath226 .",
    "consider @xmath227 in the form @xmath228 with @xmath229 according to the standard wkb expansion :    [ rate equations ] @xmath230    substituting to the shroedinger equation above and equalizing terms near the same power of @xmath231 we get : @xmath232 @xmath233 from now we can assume @xmath7 .",
    "the first equation gives : @xmath234 dividing the second one by @xmath235 : @xmath236 that is also easily integrable .",
    "eventually , we get the underbarrier wkb wave function in polar coordinates : @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the first classical turning point corresponding to the energy @xmath239 .",
    "the constant @xmath240 can be found comparing the result with the normalized ground state wave function for the two - dimensional parabolic well : @xmath241 for the underbarrier wkb wave function near the bottom ( but far enough from the turning point , so that wkb works already ) the integral under the exponent is approximated by @xmath242 for @xmath239 as a small parameter .",
    "taking @xmath243 as the lowest energy level for two - dimensional parabolic well and equalizing the both wavefunctions , we get : @xmath244}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{\\omega r^2}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath245 was also decomposed up to the lowest order : @xmath246 .",
    "all this leads to @xmath247 the outgoing wave function ( @xmath248 , with @xmath249 as a second turning point outside the well ) : @xmath250 this is just the wave function , we are specially interested in . using it",
    ", we can estimate density of the probability current : @xmath251 we must integrate the current density over the circumference to get the total probability current coming outside the well : @xmath252 as the wave function inside the well is normalized , this expression corresponds to the transition probability through the barrier , i.e. decay rate .",
    "we have denoted @xmath253 . to link this result with the one , obtained by the instanton technique",
    ", we must represent the decay rate in terms of @xmath254 .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "we separate the integral into three parts : @xmath255 where the points @xmath256 and @xmath257 are chosen between the turning points @xmath238 and @xmath249 so , that the first integral is calculated keeping the quadratic term only of the potential , the second one is calculated making expansion in @xmath258 and the last integral is calculated approximating the potential by a linear function near the turning point  @xmath249",
    ". @xmath259 @xmath260 near the second turning point @xmath249 we approximate potential by a linear function with zero at the the point @xmath261 , such that @xmath262 : @xmath263 so that the third integral becomes @xmath264 combining this terms altogether and taking the limits @xmath265 and @xmath266 we obtain : @xmath267 that gives @xmath268 where @xmath269 what coincides with @xmath270  . evidently , using the different method we have got the same result   that was derived by the instanton technique .",
    "in deriving the formula for the decay rate using the instanton approach we have restricted ourselves to the small values of @xmath20 .",
    "as the standard wkb results gives the same formula , we conclude , that the obtained result is more general . therefore , it is worthwhile to look at the instanton trajectories even for @xmath271",
    ". obviously in this regime the trajectories are spirals , spinning out and in near the top of the hill .",
    "the question is how do the trajectories near the top `` feel '' the behavior of the potential on large distances and reproduce the right dependence of the decay rate on the 4th power term of the double well ?",
    "let us analyze this situation more carefully . during almost all the period of the instanton existence",
    "the spirals are perpendicular to the gradient direction whereas the velocities are small at the top , because of zero energy at the top .",
    "thus both the trajectories and the action must be strongly dependent on high order derivatives of the potential , i.e. the 4th power term .    although this problem can be reduced to itself under zero magnetic field as was shown above , we believe that the calculations aboce could serve at least as an instructive example of how the instanton technique works in case of a two - dimensional system with transverse magnetic field .    thus , ( i ) the instanton technique can be successfully applied to 2d models in magnetic field .",
    "( ii ) coincidence with standard wkb was obtained .",
    "( iii ) analytical continuation in @xmath20 works .",
    "now we are able to calculate the expulsion magnetic field , at what the vortex leaves superconducting dot . using the london approximation and the method of images ,",
    "the potential well inside the disk can be estimated  @xcite : @xmath272\\ ] ] where @xmath273 and @xmath274 is the distance from the center in units of the radius @xmath275 .",
    "the minimum exists until the field @xmath276 .",
    "however , due to quantum tunneling the vortex leaves the well at higher @xmath277 .",
    "we approximate this potential by the inverted double well and use the formula for the decay rate calculated above to estimate the expulsion field .",
    "this leads to the next dependance on the radius of the disk on the figure . for comparision we also present the typical dependance due to thermal activation process for some fixed temperature",
    "@xmath278    @xmath279    @xmath280",
    "zero eigenvalues can be eliminated using the faddeev - popov procedure  @xcite , that is very useful for systems with constraints in quantum field theory . as our initial path integral   is not properly defined because of overcounting of zero eigenmodes , we need to define correct measure of integration in order not to take into account the contributions from the equivalent trajectories related by symmetry group transformations ( in the field theory this usually corresponds to gauge transformations ) .",
    "thus , there are two constraints on our path integral : @xmath281\\equiv < \\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta),\\vec\\varphi_1(\\tau,\\phi_0)>\\ ] ] @xmath282\\equiv < \\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta),\\vec\\varphi_2(\\tau,\\phi_0)>\\ ] ] consider the identity : @xmath283,f_2[\\vec{r}(\\tau,\\phi_0 ) ] ] \\int_{-t}^{t } d\\eta \\int_0^{2\\pi } d\\theta \\delta(f_1[\\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta ) ] ) \\delta(f_2[\\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta ) ] ) \\equiv 1   \\label{delta}\\ ] ] where the faddeev - popov determinant @xmath284 $ ] is the jacobian of transformation of integration variables .",
    "@xmath285 , as well as the action along the trajectories close to the classical ones , is invariant under translations in time and @xmath57 : @xmath286,f_2[\\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta)]]= \\delta[f_1[\\vec{r}(\\tau,\\phi_0)],f_2[\\vec{r}(\\tau,\\phi_0)]]\\ ] ] indeed , this can be easily proved by shifting variables inside the integral  .    introducing the identity   to the path integral  : @xmath287}= \\\\ = \\int_{-t}^{t } d\\eta \\int_0^{2\\pi } d\\theta \\int d \\vec{r } e^{-s[\\vec{r}(\\tau,\\phi_0 ) ] }",
    "\\delta[f_1,f_2 ] \\delta(f_1[\\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta ) ] ) \\delta(f_2[\\vec{r}(\\tau+\\eta,\\phi_0+\\theta)])=   \\\\",

    "thus we have have transformed our integrations over zero modes to the integration over the groups of translational symmetry .",
    "the faddeev - popov determinant is found to be @xmath289= \\det \\begin{pmatrix }      \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial\\theta } & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial\\eta } \\\\",
