    "misans , mieze ( modulation of intensity with zero effort ) in the small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) geometry is a rather new technique to probe quasi - elastic scattering with extremely high energy resolution .",
    "the method is well understood @xcite and efforts are under way @xcite to establish the technique as a standard tool for measurements of slow dynamics .",
    "the general trend of new neutron sources to be accelerator driven and thus to provide pulsed neutron beams raises the question how misans will perform in a pulsed mode . in earlier experiments",
    "the feasibility of misans on pulsed sources was demonstrated @xcite , however these tests were only using the direct beam and relative low mieze frequencies .",
    "the goal of this experiment was to show that a mieze can be set up easily at a new beamline and works well in the time - of - flight mode with samples .",
    "therefore a compact turn - key misans setup from the frm ii in munich @xcite was installed at the hfir in oak ridge , tennessee , usa , at the beamline cg-1d @xcite .",
    "sketch of the setup used for the misans experiment during the second beam session , viewed from the side .",
    "the chopper ( ch ) provided a pulsed beam with a frequency of 40hz and a pulse length of 0.14ms , corresponding to a chopper opening of @xmath0 .",
    "the two polarizers ( p@xmath1 and p@xmath2 ) were placed before and after the zero field region ( hatched ) of the mieze box , which contained the two mieze coils ( c@xmath1 and c@xmath2 ) .",
    "three apertures ( a@xmath1 to a@xmath3 ) were installed so that the beam is restricted to the sample ( s ) , located inside a cryomagnet . the time - resolved detector ( d )",
    "was placed at the correct distance to fulfill the mieze condition ( eq . [ eq : miezecond ] ) . ]",
    "the used setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] : two sets of mieze coils inside -metal shielding @xcite are placed between two polarizers .",
    "the polarizers are polarising solid state benders @xcite , which polarise the transmitted beam , but keep the collimation intact @xcite .",
    "we used two approximately @xmath4mm@xmath5 apertures ( a@xmath1 and a@xmath3 in figure [ fig : setup ] ) in about 3 m distance from each other for a rough collimation and suppression of the reflected spin states from the polarizers .",
    "the frequencies in the rf coils ranged between 46 and 149khz and matched the static fields : @xmath6    in order to simplify the setup , the coupling coils were replaced by small guide fields and therefore all static fields were either parallel or anti - parallel to the strong magnetisation fields of the polarizers .",
    "this simplification of the setup removed the need for an adiabatic rotation of the neutron polarisation in the static fields by 90@xmath7 as usual in mieze experiments and thus allowed a quicker adjustment of the setup in a new environment .",
    "the trade - off is that the mieze coils can only be operated in a @xmath8-mode , since the initial polarization is parallel to the static field of the @xmath9 coils . in this mode ,",
    "each mieze coil must perform a @xmath8 flip to achieve the coherent splitting of two spin states that leads to the focused coherent overlap at the mieze point @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the usual mieze setup , which is preferred for all new developments , each mieze coil induces a @xmath10 flip , and in combination with a `` bootstrap '' arrangement a factor of four in time resolution is gained in comparison to our @xmath10/2 mode setup .    for this time - of - flight mieze instrument ,",
    "the rf amplitude needs to be modulated to match the condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 is planck s constant , @xmath13 is the rf coil thickness , @xmath14 the neutron velocity , @xmath15 its mass and @xmath16 its wavelength . in a time - of - flight instrument ,",
    "the wavelength of a neutron with time of flight @xmath17 at one component is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the component s distance from the source .",
    "as the mieze module was originally developed for operation at a reactor source , the rf current was not modulated with the time of flight in the present setup .    as detector",
    "we used a circular multi - channel - plate prototype @xcite , with a diameter of 40 mm and only about 1520% detection efficiency for cold neutrons , but it provided sufficient time resolution and a very good spatial resolution ( pixel size about 10 m ) , both of which might become very useful in future tests at higher time resolution .",
    "the detector was always positioned according to the mieze condition @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the distance between the coils , @xmath22 the distance between second coil and detector and @xmath23 are the rf frequencies .",
    "the chopper at cg-1d has an opening of 2@xmath7 and was running at 40hz , which results in a pulse length of 0.14ms . at the first mieze coil ,",
    "positioned 0.6 m from the chopper , this amounts to a wavelength spread of @xmath24 at @xmath25 and 8% at @xmath26 . at the detector position at 5.07 m distance",
    ", the @xmath27 reduced to 1.7% and 0.9% , respectively .",
    "we report the results from two separate beam sessions , where we implemented slightly different instrumental parameters .",
    "the goal in the first beam session was to set up the mieze devices for the first time at cg-1d , while the goal in the second beam session was to perform a first sample measurement .",
    "intensity modulation and resulting contrast for the direct beam wavelength spectrum for two different mieze frequencies , @xmath28khz and @xmath29khz .",
    "the contrast is calculated by binning the spectrum into 8 bins per oscillation and fitting a sinusoidal signal to the summation of 12 individual oscillations for each point .",
    "the black arrows indicate the bragg absorption edges of al .",
    "note that for better clarity , the spectrum for @xmath28khz has been shifted by 0.5 on the intensity scale . ]",
    "figure [ fig : twofreq ] shows the result of the first test , a mieze modulation on the time - of - flight spectrum of the chopped beam at cg-1d with two different frequencies .",
    "the absorption edges of aluminum ( marked with black arrows ) and silicon ( used in the solid - state polarizers ) are clearly visible as dips in the maxwellian shape of the spectra and were used to calibrate the time - of - flight to wavelength conversion .",
    "the rf frequencies were 46/69khz and 99/149khz , respectively , with distances @xmath30 m and @xmath31 m to fulfill the mieze condition .",
    "for calculating the mieze contrast in these and all other spectra , the spectrum is binned into 8 bins per mieze oscillation .",
    "each oscillation spans a time - of - flight interval @xmath32 . to improve statistics ,",
    "8 to 15 individual oscillations are summed before a sinusoidal signal @xmath33 with a fixed phase @xmath34 is fitted to the spectra .",
    "the contrast @xmath35 of the fitted signal is the mieze contrast .",
    "the maximum contrast in our tests was about 50% , which is most likely due to one of the mieze - coil sets having been damaged during the oversea transport causing static stray fields near the rf - coils and therefore interfering with the correct operation of the flippers .",
    "note that for @xmath29khz , the effect of not ramping the rf current becomes clearly visible : the @xmath8 flip is achieved for neutrons of 3 , which means that at the same current neutrons of 6 will be flipped by @xmath10 , which makes the contrast vanish completely in our mieze mode .",
    "if there was enough intensity at 9 , one should see a considerable contrast again , in this case making @xmath36 flips in the coils .",
    "all the following measurements were performed in a second beam time , using only one set of rf frequencies of 99/124khz .",
    "the frequency ratio was chosen differently because with eq .",
    "( [ eq : miezecond ] ) it results in a longer distance between second coil and detector , and allowed us to insert a cryomagnet at the sample position .",
    "contrast as a function of wavelength in the direct beam for various output voltages applied at the rf generator .",
    "the solid lines are guides to the eye .",
    "the mieze frequency was @xmath37khz .",
    "note that with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rfmod ] ) half the rf field should flip twice the wavelength ; this does not hold for the output voltage due to nonlinearities in the rf amplifier and circuit . ]    to elucidate the effect of rf current ramping , figure [ fig : amplscan ] shows the contrast as a function of wavelength in the direct beam for various output voltages in the rf generators . note that on the one hand , towards very short wavelengths the initial beam polarization decreases rapidly , and therefore the maximum mieze contrast decreases . on the other hand , for large wavelengths the effect of stray fields",
    "becomes more pronounced , which again influences the maximum contrast .",
    "intensity of the magnetic mnsi peaks as a function of position on the detector for various wavelengths .",
    "the detector was moved by 3 cm out of the direct beam for fulfilling the bragg condition and the intensity was summed over 1 intervals around the given wavelength .",
    "the vertical arrows represent a calculation of the expected bragg positions of the mnsi peak for the mean wavelength of the interval . ]    without changing the mieze setup we moved the detector 3 cm out of the direct beam in order to measure the neutrons scattered by the helical magnetic order in a mnsi sample placed inside the cryostat at zero field .",
    "mnsi is a weak itinerant ferromagnet that below @xmath38k forms a magnetic spiral with a pitch @xmath39 , and magnetic satellite peaks become observable at @xmath40@xmath41 in the @xmath42 directions @xcite .",
    "we aligned the sample such that one of the peaks falls onto the detector in the small - angle scattering condition : see figure [ fig : linescan ] .",
    "the vertical arrows on the plot are the calculated positions for the bragg peak from the helical order using @xmath43 with the position of the sample peak @xmath44@xmath41 , the planck constant @xmath12 , the neutron mass @xmath15 , the time of flight @xmath17 between the chopper and the detector for a distance @xmath45 m .",
    "the peak intensity moves further away from the direct beam for longer neutron wavelengths in order to maintain bragg s law .",
    "the intermediate scattering function @xmath46 of the mieze signal from mnsi at @xmath47@xmath41 is shown for @xmath48k as measured ( blue ) and after normalization ( black ) with the instrumental resolution function as determined at @xmath49k ( green ) .",
    "the spin - echo times are calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : miezetime ] ) . ]    for the data analysis , the part of the direct beam still visible on the detector has been subtracted in the form of a measurement at high temperatures , where no magnetic signal is present .",
    "the blue curve in figure [ fig : mnsi ] shows the contrast measured in the neutron beam scattered by the mnsi sample at @xmath48k at the bragg peak at @xmath47@xmath41 for different spin - echo times , corresponding to different wavelengths in the incoming beam according to @xmath50 with the sample ",
    "detector distance @xmath51 m .    to obtain the intermediate scattering function @xmath46 , shown as the black curve in figure [ fig : mnsi ] , this data was normalized to the contrast measured analogously at @xmath49k ( the green curve ) , serving as the reference measurement of the instrumental resolution @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this @xmath46 is equal to one , since the sample dynamics below @xmath52 are too slow to be observed at the present time resolution at the bragg peak @xcite .    to finally assess the field compatibility of the technique beyond what had previously been demonstrated , we moved the detector back into the direct beam and looked at the contrast of the mieze signal as a function of a horizontal magnetic field at the sample position .",
    "contrast of the mieze signal in the direct beam for various magnetic fields at the sample position .",
    "the small loss of @xmath53 with increasing field is due to the missing coupling coils and the insufficient -metal shielding . ]",
    "figure [ fig : bfield ] confirms that the mieze technique works with unshielded horizontal magnetic fields of up to 1 t .",
    "the observed drop in contrast to about 70% of its zero - field value we attribute to the fact that we performed this experiment without coupling coils and with a low - quality -metal shielding around the mieze coils .",
    "nevertheless the results show that mieze works even under unfavourable stray field conditions .",
    "the effort to establish misans as a measurement technique for tof applications is on the way and this paper documents important results along the path : the experiment establishes that misans can measure samples on pulsed neutron beamlines and the measurement of a mieze - signal in the direct beam with a 1 t horizontal field at the sample region demonstrates that this is a most promising technique for measurements of slow dynamics in high magnetic fields .    in the future",
    ", the setup could be extended to develop a mieze insert available as a standard option at several instruments at the sns or at a dedicated mieze - sans instrument at hfir .",
    "it is also planned to propose a misans - type instrument for the european spallation source ( ess ) . here",
    ", the instrument can benefit from the extended wavelength range , since the relaxed requirements on wavelength resolution typical for sans are also acceptable for mieze - sans .",
    "this means that similar gain factors can be expected .",
    "we acknowledge the support of ian s. anderson for making these tests possible at hfir .",
    "we are grateful for the help of mike fleenor and the staff at hfir during the beam times .",
