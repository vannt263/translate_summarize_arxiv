    "reliable mass estimates for the stellar components of compact binaries , i.e.  cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and x  ray binaries ( xbs ) , are notoriously difficult to obtain . except for the few",
    "double  lined eclipsing systems a successful mass determination hinges on an estimate of the orbital inclination and on subtleties in defining the effective dynamical centre of the emission from the donor star ( see e.g.  smith & dhillon 1998 ) .    in practice ,",
    "masses in short  period cvs or xbs are often estimated with the assumption that the donor star ( the secondary ) obeys a main  sequence mass  radius relation . a simple consequence of roche geometry and kepler s law is that in a semidetached binary the orbital period @xmath4 and the mean density of the donor are related via @xmath5 ( e.g.  king 1988 ) .",
    "here @xmath6 denotes the period in hr , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the radius @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 of the donor star in solar units .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 is a weak function of mass ratio @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the primary mass ) , with @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "if the secondary is in the core hydrogen burning phase its radius can be expressed as @xmath16 usually with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , so that ( [ eq1 ] ) reads @xmath19    in short ",
    "period ` j  driven ' compact binaries , where the orbital angular momentum losses drive mass transfer , the donor star can deviate from this standard mass  radius relation mainly for the two following reasons .",
    "+ ( i )  the secondary experiences continuous mass loss which perturbs thermal equilibrium .",
    "the surface luminosity is no longer in balance with the luminosity generated in the core by nuclear reactions , and the difference causes the star to expand or contract .",
    "losing main  sequence stars are smaller than in thermal equilibrium when they are predominantly radiative , i.e.  for @xmath20 , while they are oversized if they are predominantly convective , i.e.  for @xmath21 ( e.g.  whyte & eggleton 1983 ; stehle et al .",
    "1996 ; baraffe & kolb 2000 ) .",
    "+ ( ii )  the donor star could have evolved off the zero  age main  sequence ( zams ) prior to mass transfer .",
    "once mass transfer is under way the nuclear state at the onset of mass transfer is effectively frozen in . once sufficiently low ",
    "mass , these donors mimic stars that are older than a hubble time .",
    "recently , baraffe & kolb ( 2000 ; see also kolb & baraffe 2000 ) argued that the observed late spectral type of cv secondaries provide strong evidence that a large fraction of cv secondaries have evolved off the zams prior to mass transfer .",
    "similarly , theoretical arguments suggest that the majority of short  period neutron  star xbs form with fairly massive donors ( @xmath22 ) , allowing them to age prior to mass loss",
    ". the constant @xmath23 in ( [ eq2 ] ) can therefore vary significantly .    applying ( [ eq3 ] ) to estimate the donor mass",
    "would usually give a value which is larger than the real mass .",
    "the donor is _ undermassive _ compared to a zams star that fills the roche lobe in the given binary .    in the following",
    "we show that the effective temperature of the donor star  and hence its spectral type  is much less sensitive to the effects of mass loss and nuclear ageing than the radius . using the latest generation of low ",
    "mass star models we explore theoretically to what extent the spectral type provides a reasonable estimate of the donor mass . in addition , we reconsider beekman et al.s ( 1997 ) attempt to place a lower limit on the black hole ( or neutron star ) mass in soft x  ray transients .",
    "for our numerical experiments we employ the latest generation of low  mass star and brown dwarf models by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 , 1998 , henceforth summarized as bcah models ) which represent a significant improvement in the quantitative description of stars with mass @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the main strengths of the models are in two areas : the microphysics determining the equation of state in the stellar interior , and the non  grey atmosphere models which enter as the outer boundary condition .",
    "the equation of state ( saumon , chabrier and van horn 1995 ) is specifically calculated for very low  mass stars , brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "recent much improved cool atmosphere models ( hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 ; see also the review of allard et al .",
    "1997 ) now provide realistic atmosphere profiles , which we use as the outer boundary condition , and synthetic spectra .",
    "chabrier & baraffe ( 1997 ) have shown that evolutionary models employing a grey atmosphere instead , e.g.  the standard eddington approximation , overestimate the effective temperature for a given mass , and yield too large a minimum hydrogen burning mass .    for a more detailed description of the code and the numerous tests against observations we refer to baraffe & kolb ( 2000 ) , kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ; 2000 ) , and references therein .",
    "we obtain the spectral type of a stellar model from its calculated colour @xmath26 and the empirical spt@xmath27 relation established by beuermann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "one of the main uncertainty in stellar models is the treatment of convection .",
    "here we use the standard mixing length theory , with the ratio @xmath28 = @xmath29 of mixing length @xmath30 and local pressure scale height @xmath31 as a free parameter . except for the specific case of the sun",
    ", @xmath28 can not be calibrated very well by a comparison between observations and models .",
    "the chief reason for this is that the age and chemical composition of observed stars is usually not known independently ( see baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ; baraffe 1999 ) .",
    "according to such comparisons , the most likely range for @xmath28 is between 1 and 2 .",
    "recent 2dim .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( ludwig , freytag & steffen 1999 ) also show a variation of @xmath28 with effective temperature @xmath32 and surface gravity @xmath33 between typically 1 and 2 .",
    "we therefore adopt this range of values to characterize the present uncertainty due to convection .",
    "the spectral type of chemically inhomogeneous stars ( @xmath34 ) depends on the choice of @xmath28 , while unevolved , fully convective stellar models are insensitive to @xmath28 .",
    ".spectral type and corresponding donor mass @xmath10 along the sequences displayed in fig .  .",
    "the mass in the second column ( taken from the sequence with initial donor mass @xmath35 @xmath25 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) defines an approximate lower limit to the mass of any donor with spectral type spt , the mass in the third column ( from the unevolved sequence with @xmath39 @xmath25 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) an approximate upper limit . there is no lower limit for spt later than k6 .",

    "mass main  sequence stars is rather insensitive to their degree of thermal disequilibrium .",
    "they behave just like giant stars on the hayashi line , with nearly constant effective temperature .",
    "this is well understood in terms of the analytic hayashi line theory for fully convective stars ( e.g.  kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath32 is not very sensitive to the nuclear age of the star .",
    "star tracks in the hr diagram run almost vertical while on the lower main  sequence .",
    "using bcah models we quantify the deviation from equilibrium spectral type , as a measure of the surface temperature , for the donor stars in j ",
    "driven compact binaries with various evolutionary histories .",
    "we simplify the problem by considering sequences with constant mass transfer rate @xmath42 . to bracket the evolution of real systems where @xmath42 presumably varies with orbital period",
    "we calculate sequences with a high transfer rate and with a low transfer rate .",
    "test sequences where we computed the transfer rate self  consistently according to simple orbital angular momentum loss descriptions give indeed the same qualitative and quantitative results .",
    "we first discuss sequences calculated with solar metallicity and @xmath43 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : spm1 ] and [ fig : spm2 ] ) .    in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spm1 ] we show the _ standard sequence _ of baraffe & kolb ( 2000 ) . here",
    "mass transfer starts from an unevolved ( zams ) donor with mass 1 @xmath25 , proceeds at a constant rate @xmath44 @xmath45 , stops when the donor becomes fully convective ( at mass 0.21 @xmath25 ) , and resumes at the lower rate @xmath46 @xmath45 once the donor has settled back into thermal equilibrium .",
    "this sequence fits the period gap in the framework of disrupted orbital braking ( e.g.  king 1988 ) . in addition , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spm2 ] we plot two other sequences that start from a @xmath47 zams star ( thin lines ; henceforth `` unevolved sequences '' ) , one calculated with @xmath48 @xmath45 , the other with @xmath49 @xmath45 .",
    "the mass transfer rates in j  driven compact binaries are usually estimated to be well @xmath50 @xmath45 ( see e.g.  warner 1995 , his fig .",
    "9.8 , for cvs ; chen et al .",
    "1997 for xbs )",
    ". a white dwarf system with @xmath51 @xmath45 would not appear as a cv at all , but presumably as a supersoft x  ray binary ( e.g.  van den heuvel 1992 ; see also king et al .  2000 ) .",
    "[ fig : spm1 ] shows that the effect of thermal disequilibrium is negligible along the standard sequence ; this hardly differs from that for systems with a zams donor ( i.e.  in thermal equilibrium ) . if @xmath52 is higher than in the standard sequence , the spectral type is slightly later for a given mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spm2 ] ) .",
    "even the extreme sequence with @xmath51 @xmath45 never deviates by more than @xmath3 for a given spt from this relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spm2 ] , thin solid line ) .",
    "in other words , unevolved donor stars follow an almost unique spt@xmath10 relation , the one given by the zams .",
    "this relation is much less well  defined when we include systems where the secondary has already burned a significant fraction of its hydrogen supply in the detached phase prior to mass transfer .",
    "note that along these `` evolved sequences '' the donor is still in the core hydrogen burning phase , otherwise the system would evolve off to longer periods ( see.g .  savonije & pylyser 1988 ) .",
    "standard common envelope arguments predict that cvs form over the whole range of secondary masses , @xmath53 , hence the majority of cvs should have essentially unevolved donors ( politano 1996 , de  kool 1992 ) .",
    "yet the generally late spectral type in systems with @xmath54 suggests that a fair fraction of cvs actually contain an evolved secondary ( baraffe & kolb 2000 ; kolb & baraffe 2000 ; see also ritter 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , evolutionary considerations suggest that most short  period neutron  star xbs form with a somewhat evolved main  sequence donor with mass @xmath55 @xmath25 ( king & kolb 1997 ; kalogera & webbink 1998 ; kalogera et al .",
    "this is mainly because systems with a more massive secondary stand a greater chance of surviving the supernova explosion and associated mass ejection at neutron star formation .",
    "it is therefore important to consider evolved sequences .",
    "[ fig : spm1 ] shows  in addition to the standard sequence discussed above  a moderately evolved low @xmath52 sequence ( initial central hydrogen content @xmath56 , initial donor mass @xmath35 @xmath25 , @xmath57 @xmath45 ) and a significantly evolved , low @xmath52 sequence ( @xmath58 , @xmath35 @xmath25 , @xmath57 @xmath45 ) where the donor was almost at the terminal main sequence at turn  on of mass transfer .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : spm2 ] we see that the mass transfer rate has the same relative effect on evolved and unevolved sequences : the evolutionary track is shifted vertically downwards , to later spectral types .",
    "the tracks in heavy linestyle are evolved sequences , one with high mass transfer rate ( solid line ; @xmath59 @xmath45 ; @xmath58 , @xmath39 @xmath25 ) , the other with low mass transfer rate ( dashed ; @xmath57 @xmath45 , @xmath58 , @xmath35 @xmath25 ; same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spm1 ] ) .",
    "the highly evolved track with low transfer rate ( @xmath60 ) and the unevolved track with high transfer rate ( @xmath40 ) should bracket the location of compact binary secondaries .",
    "[ fig : spm3 ] shows the effect of the mixing length parameter @xmath28 on these limiting curves in the spt vs.  mass diagram .",
    "unevolved tracks become undistinguishable for predominantly convective donors ( @xmath61 ) , while the most evolved sequences are quite sensitive to @xmath28 .",
    "table  [ tab0 ] gives lower and upper limits to @xmath10 for a given spectral type .",
    "the range reflected in this table is to some extent due to our ignorance of the appropriate mixing length parameter .",
    "the metallicity @xmath62 of the donor can affect the mass  spectral type relationship as well .",
    "lower @xmath62 gives a lower mass for a given spectral type .",
    "however , as stressed by beuermann et al .  ( 1998 ) , there is no evidence for low metallicity secondaries in the currently observed sample of cvs .",
    "hence we restrict our analysis to systems with solar metallicity ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the observations compiled by smith & dhillon ( 1998 ) , when taken at face value , are broadly consistent with the band shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spm3 ] ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "they do not , however , help to constrain the mixing length parameter .",
    "four out of 22 systems in their sample fall outside the region defined by tab .",
    "[ tab0 ] , even when the quoted errorbars are taken into account : u gem , ip peg , cn ori and a0620 - 00 .",
    "the donor masses of two of these systems have recently been revised to much smaller values . for u gem ( m4m5 ) ,",
    "long & gilliland ( 1999 ) give @xmath64 as preferred value .",
    "given the uncertainty on the inclination we consider the remaining disagreement with the limits in tab .",
    "[ tab0 ] as too marginal to deduce any conflict with theory .",
    "similarly , beekman et al .",
    "2000 find the new value @xmath65 for the donor mass of ip peg .",
    "taking into account the range of spectral type determinations ( m2m5 ; ritter & kolb 1998 ; smith & dhillon 1998 ) this system is now in agreement with tab .",
    "[ tab0 ] . the mass estimate for the discrepant system",
    "cn ori is suspect as it is based on radial velocity curves exhibiting significant phase shifts ( smith & dhillon 1998 ) .",
    "finally , the donor star in a0620 - 00 clearly is very undermassive and must be highly evolved . as the accretor is a black hole the initial donor mass could have been much larger than @xmath66 ( the value considered here and representative for cvs and neutron ",
    "star lmxbs ) .    if the observed sample is restricted to double  lined , eclipsing cvs where the secondary mass can be determined independent of the main  sequence assumption ( [ eq3 ] ) for the secondary , the limits in tab .",
    "[ tab0 ] are acceptable in all but two cases ( data from ritter & kolb , 1998 , updated ) .",
    "the two cases where the agreement is only marginal are u gem ( see above ) and em cyg , where the recently re  determined donor mass , @xmath67 ( north et al .",
    "2000 ) , appears to be somewhat too large for the spectral type k3 .",
    "this work originally started as an attempt to improve on a a paper by beekman et al .",
    "( 1997 : hereafter b97 ) who considered limits to the primary mass in soft x  ray transients .",
    "although it turned out that our results do not significantly improve these limits , we wish to comment on the method suggested by b97 as a whole , and point out an error in their analysis , which so far has not been corrected in the literature .",
    "b97 made use of an inequality derived by king , kolb & burderi 1996 ( hereafter kkb ) , which expresses the condition for a short  period low  mass x  ray binary to have an unstable accretion disc and thus appear as a transient .",
    "unfortunately b97 misunderstood the definition of the quantity @xmath68 in this inequality .",
    "@xmath69 is defined by kkb as the ratio of the secondary mass @xmath8 to that of the zams star , @xmath70 ( in solar units ) , which would fill its roche lobe in a binary of the same orbital period , @xmath71 as is obvious from ( [ eq1 ] ) the relevant main  sequence star has the same _ mean density _ as the secondary ; hence the notation @xmath70 . b97",
    "confused @xmath69 with the ratio @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the mass ( in solar units ) of a zams star that has the same _ absolute radius _ @xmath9 as the secondary .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath74 so that a lower bound on @xmath69 ( which is required to obtain a primary mass limit ) is @xmath75^{3/2}.                                 \\label{3}\\ ] ] here @xmath76 is the mean density of the secondary , ( given directly by the binary period , see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and @xmath77 is the mean density of the main  sequence star with the same spectral type as the secondary . this is weaker by a factor @xmath78^{1/2}$ ] compared to b97 s limit , which in turn weakens the limits on @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to this obvious mistake , we caution that the limitations and uncertainties inherent in using the disc instability criterion are probably too severe to give a reliable mass limit .",
    "this criterion assumes that the binary transfers mass as a result of angular momentum losses ( ` j  driven ' ) rather than nuclear expansion of the secondary ( ` n  driven ' ) , but allows for the fact that this star may be somewhat nuclear  evolved before mass transfer begins .",
    "it is therefore only appropriate for short orbital periods .",
    "although the disc instability criterion correctly represents the statistical properties of the observed sample of soft x  ray transients , its application to individual systems is suspect for at least two reasons .    1 .",
    "the criterion is based on a comparison of the secular mean mass transfer rate driven by magnetic braking and the critical mass transfer rate for disc stability .",
    "hence uncertainties in the magnetic braking strength , in particular at long orbital periods , and in the critical rate ( see kkb ; king , kolb & szuszkiewicz 1997 ; dubus et al .  1999 ) propagate directly into the mass limit .    2 .",
    "it is not clear if a given system is j  driven , in particular if the period is @xmath79  h. the ultimate fate of a system as j or n  driven is determined by its orbital period @xmath80 when mass transfer begins .",
    "if this exceeds a certain ` bifurcation period ' @xmath81 ( pylyser & savonije , 1988 , 1989 ) the binary eventually becomes a diverging n  driven system , while if @xmath82 it ends up as j  driven .",
    "uncertainties in for example the strength of magnetic braking at periods @xmath83 hr make @xmath84 correspondingly uncertain .",
    "further , even given a definite value of @xmath81 , n  driven systems born near this period initially evolve to periods below it ( pylyser & savonije , 1988 , 1989 ) before nuclear evolution eventually wins out and drives the system to long periods .",
    "this comment is particularly relevant for the neutron ",
    "star transients cen x4 and aql x1 .",
    "we have applied up  to  date stellar models of low ",
    "mass main  sequence stars to investigate the mass  spectral type relation if these stars experience mass loss and are somewhat nuclear  evolved .",
    "unevolved stars follow an almost unique spt@xmath10 relation , whatever the mass transfer rate . nuclear  evolved stars have a somewhat earlier spectral type than a zams star with the same mass .",
    "the spectral type is earlier if the star is more evolved .",
    "accurate mass predictions for a given spectral type are hampered by the present uncertainty of the mixing length parameter .",
    "the mass @xmath0 of a zams star with the same spectral type as the donor is effectively an upper limit to the donor mass .",
    "the lower mass limit for a given spectral type depends on the mixing length parameter .",
    "if this is large , there is no lower limit if the spectral type is later than k6 .",
    "the band width decreases from @xmath1 at k6 to less than @xmath2 at k0 .",
    "if the mixing length parameter is small , there is no lower mass limit if the spectral type is later than m2 , and the band width decreases from @xmath2 at m2 to less than @xmath3 for types earlier than k0 .",
    "a logical next step is to consider the evolution of thermally unstable systems that start mass transfer from a fairly massive donor ( @xmath85 ) and reappear as j  driven short ",
    "period systems after reversal of the mass ratio .",
    "detailed calculations of such systems are underway ( schenker et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "these will allow us to assess how different descendants of thermal  timescale mass transfer are from the systems considered here , which had a more moderate initial mass ( @xmath86 ) and were j  driven from the start .",
    "the results presented here are rather robust and inevitable predictions of standard stellar structure and evolution theory that has been successfully tested against observations of isolated low  mass stars .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to test them by observational means , i.e.  by a reliable donor mass determination in systems with spectral type in the indicated range .",
