    "the three - body problem has been a topic of active research since the seventeenth century , initially most of the effort focusing on bound solutions and their long time stability .",
    "this problem was  solved \" through the work of ( a ) poincar 1893 , who showed that the general solutions of even the simplest variant of the problem ( apart from highly symmetric configurations ) , the restricted planar circular three - body problem , can not be written in the form of convergent series , and ( b ) marchal and bozis ( 1982 ) , who showed that in the general three body problem zero velocity curves do not exist , so that one of the bodies can always escape to infinity .",
    "however the  inverse \" problem , i.e. the interaction of a body coming from  infinity \" with a binary pair , has attracted less attention . from the astrophysical point of view , there are three distinctive special forms of this problem : ( a ) the binary members and the incoming body have similar masses ( interaction of a  passing \" star with a binary star ) , ( b ) the binary consists of a massive and a small body and the incoming body is massive ( a passing star interacting with a planetary system ) and ( c ) the binary consists of a massive and a small body and the incoming body is small ( a passing planet interacting with a planetary system ) .",
    "the first two forms have already been discussed in the literature ( e.g. see boyd & macmillan , 1993 ; mikkola , 1994 ; donnison , 2008 for the first , astakhov and farrelly , 2004 for the second ) .",
    "however the third one has attracted limited interest up to now ( e.g. see donnison , 2006 ) , probably because planets were considered always to be bodies revolving about stars .",
    "the discovery of free floating planets ( ffps ) a few years ago changed this picture .",
    "the initial report by zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the observation of free - floating planets with masses @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is jupiter s mass ) was regarded initially with scepticism , since it was not consistent with the generally accepted definition of a planet .",
    "however subsequent microlensing observations ( sumi et al . , 2011 ) showed that celestial bodies with masses @xmath3 really do exist in the milky way , and for that in numbers exceeding those of its stars , making the interaction of ffps with already existing planetary systems a noteworthy process . in any case , recent publications ( e.g. see adams _",
    "2006 ; malmberg it et al .",
    ", 2007 _ ) have shown that the probability of such an interaction is non - trivial within clusters of newborn stars , where a planet ejected from a young planetary system ( or condensed independently ) may remain within the cluster for long time intervals . in the present paper",
    "we study numerically the simplest possible model of such an interaction , namely a bound planet ( bp ) on circular orbit around a star , scattering a ffp approaching from  infinity \" on a coplanar orbit .",
    "the interaction of a ffp with an existing star - planet binary system has only four possible outcome states : the incoming body ( a ) goes to infinity , probably exciting the planet ( flyby ) , ( b ) replaces in orbit around the star the bp , which in turn goes to infinity ( exchange ) ( c ) is captured by the star - planet binary system , forming a two - planet planetary system ( temporary capture ) or ( d ) the system is disrupted ( disruption ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) .",
    "if the initial total energy of the system is negative , as in our numerical experiments , the fourth outcome is ruled out and we are left with only three possible outcomes .        from the purely dynamical point of view , however , the situation is more complicated",
    ". the interaction can be distinguished into  single- \" and  multiple - encounter \" events . in a single - encounter event",
    "the ffp interacts only briefly with the bp ( e.g. for a time interval less than one unperturbed period of the bp ) while in a multiple encounter event the ffp enters in orbit around the star and interacts for an extended period of time with the bp ( typically much more than one unperturbed period ) .",
    "therefore a single encounter event can result only in flyby or exchange , which may be thought of as  direct \" outcomes .",
    "to the contrary , a multiple encounter event ( temporary capture ) is not a  definitive \" outcome , since after some time interval one of the two planets may escape to infinity ( e.g. see marchal & bozis , 1982 ) .",
    "in other words , a temporary capture may ultimately decay to a flyby or an exchange , which , in this sense , may be considered as  indirect \" outcomes .",
    "therefore finally a more comprehensive classification of the possible outcomes may read as follows : flyby ( direct and indirect ) , exchange ( direct and indirect ) and  long - time \" capture .",
    "it is not possible to guarantee a permanent capture since , as we mentioned already , in the general three - body problem closed zero - velocity curves do not exist ( except from cases that are hill stable ) .",
    "but , as we show in section 4 , the statistical analysis of our results indicates that a percentage of temporary captures end up in  deep \" captures , in the sense that the resulting two - planet system may remain stable for very long times .",
    "in fact , if a fourth body exists nearby or other forces ( e.g. tides ) are taken into account , the 3-body system might be stabilized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the setting of our numerical experiments . in section 3",
    "we show that the scattering process is a fractal one , we calculate the uncertainty exponent and we give the probability of each one of the possible outcomes of the scattering . in section 4",
    "we present our main results , concerning ( a ) the dependence of the scattering outcomes on the mass of the incoming ffp , ( b ) the physics behind capture and ( c ) the orbital distribution ( in the cases of capture and exchange ) as a function of the mass and the impact parameter of the ffp . in section 5",
    "we deal with the decay of temporary captures and in section 6 we find the initial conditions that lead to prograde or retrograde orbits . finally in section 7",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "we perform numerical experiments of the three body scattering between a star  planet system and an incoming ffp .",
    "the three bodies are considered as point masses moving on coplanar orbits and are : a star of mass @xmath4 , a bp of mass @xmath2 in orbit around the star , and the ffp with mass @xmath5 similar to that of the bp , incoming from infinity .",
    "the initial configuration of the scattering experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the star is initially placed at rest at the origin of the inertial reference frame @xmath6 and the bp is placed at a distance @xmath7 with initial velocity , @xmath8 , corresponding to a circular orbit around the star .",
    "the ffp is coming from a fixed distance of 40@xmath7 with impact parameter @xmath9 and initial parabolic velocity @xmath10 with respect to the star .",
    "this distance is sufficient to ensure that the ffp and the original planetary system are not initially interacting strongly .",
    "the initial velocity , @xmath10 , of the ffp is estimated as a function of @xmath9 through the relationship :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 . keeping all other parameters fixed , the initial state of the system is determined by the impact parameter of the ffp , @xmath9 , and the initial phase of the bp , @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath9 can take both positive and negative values . by convention",
    ", we assign a negative value to @xmath9 when the angular momentums of the bp and the ffp have different signs ( @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and positive otherwise ( @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the initial values of the impact parameter are restricted in the interval @xmath16 , where exchange and temporary capture are mainly expected to occur ( see e.g. donnison , 1984a , b ) . within the configuration of fig .",
    "2 the total energy of the system at the center of mass is always negative , although it depends weakly on @xmath13 and @xmath9 .    it should be noted that the ( dimensionless ) interval of impact parameters chosen here is the one that yields dynamically interesting results .",
    "ffps passing at a larger distance have minor effects on the bp .",
    "that is why the most promising site for this kind of interaction is in dispersing clusters ( see , e.g. , perets & kouwenhoven , 2012 ) .",
    "but the _ dimensional _ value of impact parameters in aus depends on @xmath7 .",
    "if one is taking as example our solar system , then he could consider as  bound planet \" ( bp ) anyone of the giant planets .",
    "when considering jupiter as bp the impact parameter is 35 au , while when considering neptune it is 210 au .    .",
    "the bp is initially on a circular orbit around the star and the ffp is coming with parabolic co - planar velocity from a fixed distance , sufficient to ensure that it is not initially interacting strongly with the planetary system .",
    "the initial state of the system is determined by the impact parameter , @xmath9 , of the ffp and the initial phase , @xmath13 , of the bp .",
    "note that @xmath9 is negative for retrogade orbits ( @xmath14 ) and positive for prograde orbits ( @xmath15).,width=415 ]      our dynamical system is an autonomous one with six degrees of freedom and is described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the positions of the ffp , the star and the bp with respect to the inertial reference frame @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the corresponding momenta .",
    "the initial position and momentum of the three bodies are : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 for the star , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 for the bp and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for the ffp .    throughout the numerical experiments we fix the mass ratio of the star - planet system equal to the mass ratio of the sun - jupiter system and we set the radius of the planet s orbit ( @xmath7 ) equal to the semi - major axis of jupiter .",
    "we use a system of units where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that the mass , circular velocity and orbital period of the bp are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the initial velocity of the ffp is determined through eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath5 and is approximately equal to @xmath43 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq2 ] ) are integrated through a rosenbrock scheme , which is optimized for stiff ordinary differential equations ( rosenbrock , 1963 ; gear , 1971 ) .",
    "due to energy exchange between the three bodies the system may end up in four qualitatively different states , depending on the total energy of the system at the center of mass . in particular there are three types of unbound motion .",
    "these are : _ flyby _ , where the ffp is deflected from the planetary system leaving it bound , _ exchange _ , where the ffp displaces the bp and takes its place orbiting the star and _ disruption _ , where the planetary system is destroyed and the three bodies move independently .",
    "disruption is possible only when the total energy of the system is zero or positive .",
    "bound motion between the three bodies is called _ temporary capture _ and can occur only when the total energy of the system is negative . at temporary capture , the ffp and the bp are temporarily bound to the star . again , due to energy exchange between the bodies at every close approach , one of the bodies ( bp or ffp ) can gain enough energy and escape .",
    "so , temporary capture can result in _ indirect flyby _",
    "( escape of the ffp ) or _ indirect exchange _",
    "( escape of the bp ) .",
    "but it is not known _ a priori _ if and when a temporary capture will  break up \" and end in indirect flyby or exchange .",
    "the state of the system at a given time after scattering is a function of the initial configuration , which is determined by the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath9 , since we keep all other parameters fixed .",
    "we have to note that the center - of - mass energy of the system is a weak function of @xmath13 and @xmath9 , but it is always negative allowing for bound motion ( temporary capture ) and ruling out disruption .",
    "our purpose is to map the initial conditions ( @xmath44 ) to the final states of the system ( flyby , exchange or temporary capture ) . in order to do this ,",
    "we choose 500 values of @xmath13 and 700 values of @xmath9 uniformly distributed in the intervals @xmath45 ( @xmath13 in cycles ) and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "@xmath46 is the maximum impact parameter for which a direct exchange can occur and may be estimated , as a function of the ffp s mass , using known analytical approximations ( e.g. see donnison , 1984a ) .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated for each initial conditions set ( _ @xmath47_,@xmath48 until a certain time @xmath49 . at that time",
    "a test is made to decide the final state of the system .",
    "however , the exit test can not distinguish between direct and indirect , flyby or exchange , since the three final states are identified only on the basis of the relative energy of the bodies in pairs at time @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the center - of - mass energies of the pairs ffp - star , bp - star and ffp - bp , they correspond to the final states as follows :    * \\a .",
    "flyby : @xmath53 * \\b .",

    "temporary capture : @xmath55    the case of capture of the ffp as a satellite of the bp @xmath56 , although possible , never appeared in our numerical experiments .",
    "the exit test is performed at time @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the unperturbed orbiting period of the bp . at this time",
    "the ffp , moving at its initial velocity , would have traveled a distance twice its initial distance from the star .",
    "typical cases of ffp and bp escapes ( since we can not be sure whether temporary capture is a _ real _ final outcome , see section [ sec : decay ] ) are given in figs .",
    "[ fig:01 ] and [ fig:03 ] .",
    "it should be noted that _",
    "temporary capture _ appears for both prograde and retrograde orbits ( gayon , 2009 ) , which , as a rule , originate from corresponding initial positive or negative impact parameters .",
    "however the opposite is not rare ( initial negative ( positive ) impact parameter leading to prograde ( retrograde ) orbits ) . from this",
    "we see that the  hidden \" physics below a final outcome ( i.e. the exact path leading to a certain outcome ) is not unique .",

    "it is interesting to note that , for a relatively large interval , the exchange and flyby probabilities depend linearly on the ffp s mass .",

    "this upper bound is a result of energy conservation .",
    "in particular , the energy taken by the escaping bp is gained at the expense of the star - ffp energy . since the binding energy of the initial star - bp pair is @xmath128 and",

    "as expected , orbits with positive impact parameter end up mostly as prograde and those with negative impact parameter mostly as retrograde",
    ". however , there are orbits for which the ffp or the bp change their initial revolution direction .",
    "this happens for low values of the impact parameter , between @xmath163 and 2@xmath131 for which the ffp s orbit passes very close by the bp s orbit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8b ] where we have prograde orbits ( gray ) with @xmath164 and retrograde orbits ( black ) with @xmath165 ) . in the majority of the cases",
    "it is the ffp that changes its revolution direction .",
    "this is to be expected , since the ffp orbit is nearly parabolic and therefore can easily become a very eccentric ellipse . the angular momentum exchange between the ffp and the bp depends on the minimal distance and relative phase of the two bodies , during their encounter .",
    "thus , the smaller the impact parameter , the closer the two bodies can get .",
    "this increases the magnitude of the angular momentum exchanged and - depending on the relative phase - increases the probability that the ffp s orbit will change its revolution direction around the host star .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the gravitational scattering of a ffp by a star - planet pair and we have shown that it is chaotic , in the sense that the boundary of a region in initial conditions that leads to a specific outcome ( i.e. flyby , capture or exchange ) is fractal . in this way",
    "our statistical approach is fully justified .",
    "one interesting result , coming out from our analysis is that the probability of exchange , flyby or temporary capture is , for values of the ffp s mass spanning one order of magnitude , a linear function of the ffp s mass , decreasing in the case of flyby and increasing in the cases of exchange and temporary capture .",
    "it should be noted that for masses of the ffp below @xmath166 exchange is not possible , due to energy conservation .",
    "another interesting result is that , in the case of exchange or temporary capture , ffps can be captured in orbits with _ moderate _ values of ( @xmath121 ) , with the simultaneous excitation of the bp s orbital elements . in the case of temporary capture , orbits",
    "where both ffp and bp have moderate values of ( @xmath121 ) make up @xmath167 of all captured orbits ( depending on the ffp s mass ) . restricting ourselves to non - hill stable interactions",
    ", there is a cumulative 4% probability that a ffp , passing within a distance of @xmath168 from the star ( where @xmath7 is the radius of the bp s circular orbit ) will be captured in orbit around the star .",
    "this cumulative probability is the sum of direct exchange ( 0.2% ) , indirect exchange ( 2% ) and asymptotic captures ( 1.6% ) . according to donnison ( 2008 ) ,",
    "the extension to 3d should increase the probability of capture of the ffp by the star - bp pair .",
    "the scattering induces an excitation of the orbital elements of the final system in both exchange and temporary capture . in exchange",
    ", the ffp can be captured in highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath169 ) with semi - major axis up to @xmath170 ( where @xmath5 the mass of the ffp and @xmath2 , @xmath7 the mass and semi - major axis of the bound planet ) . in temporary",
    "capture , the majority of the ffp orbits that survive up to @xmath171 orbital periods of the bp have very large and elongated orbits ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) with the bp being only slightly perturbed from its initial orbit .",
    "nevertheless 75% of these orbits do not intersect .",
    "the above results come out from a model with two main simplifications :",
    "( i ) co - planar configuration and ( ii ) absence of dissipation and some minor simplifications : ( iii ) circular orbit of the bp , ( iv ) fixed planet to star mass ratio and ( v ) parabolic orbit of the ffp .",
    "it would be of great interest to perform further  experiments \" , by introducing ( i ) the third dimension and ( ii ) a mechanism of tidal dissipation acting _ after _ the capture , in order to study the long - time evolution of ffp s in high-@xmath103 and high-@xmath69 orbits .",

    "<S> namely , that exoplanets are not condensed from the protoplanetary disk of their parent star . in this novel scenario a free - floating planet interacts with an already existing planetary system , created in a tight cluster , and is captured as a new planet . in the present work we study this interaction process by integrating trajectories of planet - sized bodies , which encounter a binary system consisting of a jupiter - sized planet revolving around a sun - like star . to simplify the problem we assume coplanar orbits for the bound and the free - floating planet and an initially parabolic orbit for the free - floating planet . by calculating the uncertainty exponent , a quantity that measures the dependence of the final state of the system on small changes of the initial conditions , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the interaction process is a fractal classical scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty exponent is in the range @xmath0 and is a decreasing function of time . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we see that the statistical approach we follow to tackle the problem is justified . </S>",
