    "x  ray irradiation of dense and relatively cold material in the vicinity of accreting black holes can produce an x  ray reflection spectrum characterized by fluorescent emission lines ( most notably in the iron k regime around 67  kev ) , a compton hump around @xmath22030  kev , and a soft excess below 12  kev .",

    "we tend to consider our latest model superior from a physical point of view .",
    "in fact , our latest model is particularly appealing because it can describe the whole broadband x  ray spectrum with a minimal set of well justified spectral components , namely : galactic and intrinsic absorption , a power law continuum , and its reflection off the disc ( producing the broad relativistic fe line ) and off distant matter ( as indicated by the narrow fe line ) .",
    "so far , we have considered the time  averaged x  ray spectral properties of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 . however , nls1 galaxies are known for their often extreme x  ray variability which is primarily attributed to a relatively small black hole mass .",
    "the black hole mass of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 has been estimated by malizia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to be of the order of @xmath52 ( see masetti et al 2006 for the method ) .",
    "although this is not a particularly low black hole mass , short timescale variability should be present if , as indicated by our spectral analysis , x ",
    "rays originate in the innermost regions of the accretion flow . as a reference , the light ",
    "crossing time of @xmath53 for the given black hole mass corresponds to a timescale of @xmath54  s. in fig .",
    "[ lc ] we show the xis  3 light curve in the 0.510  kev band ( bins of 256  s ) which clearly exhibits variability of more than 50 per cent in a few ks with a r.m.s .",
    "fractional variability of @xmath55 .",
    "we have performed time  resolved spectroscopy by selecting 30 intervals of 23  ks duration ( i.e. the maximum length of uninterrupted data , see fig .  [ lc ] ) to search for spectral variability and , in particular , to investigate any broad fe line variability with respect to the continuum . for simplicity , and to avoid any soft excess complication , we restrict our analysis to the 310  kev band and we use only the xis  3 because the lack of sensitivity in the xis  1 above 78  kev prevents us from defining the hard x  ray continuum with the required accuracy . given the relatively poor quality of the time  resolved data , we use the simplest possible spectral model comprising a power law continuum and two gaussian emission lines ( one narrow and one broad ) modified by an absorbing column of neutral gas fixed at the time  averaged value .",
    "all parameters are fixed to the best  fitting values from the time  averaged spectrum , except the photon index , its normalization , and the broad line intensity ( see table  1).despite this restrictive set of simplifying assumptions , the data are not of good enough quality to claim any significant variation of the broad line intensity . the continuum photon index is also consistent with being the same throughout the observation . considering longer time intervals to improve the statistics would wash out most of the short timescale flux variability , and",
    "we then refrain from performing such analysis on the whole observation .",
    "the negative result could however be due , besides to the low quality of the time  resolved data , to forcing the line parameters to be the same , looking only for a line normalization change . to test for changes in the line profile on short timescales and with a better signal  to  noise ,",
    "we have constructed spectra from intervals a and b shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] ( about 56  ks of net exposure each ) and applied the same model as before , but now letting all the broad fe line parameters free to vary .",
    "the resulting spectra and best  fitting models are shown in fig .",
    "[ ab ] and indicate the presence of a spectral feature around 5.8  kev in the brighter spectrum only .",
    "the gaussian lines in intervals a and b are resolved ( @xmath56150  ev ) have energies of @xmath57  kev and @xmath58  kev respectively , and intensities of @xmath59  ph  @xmath11  s@xmath10 and @xmath60  ph  @xmath11  s@xmath10 .    the line parameters are then suggestive of some variability , at least in the centroid energy which is significantly redder in the brighter interval ( b ) .",
    "this is visually shown in fig .",
    "[ contab ] where we use the method outlined in miniutti & fabian ( 2006 ) and show the statistical improvement obtained by running a gaussian filter through the data for intervals a and b when both spectra are modelled with the power law plus narrow 6.4  kev gaussian emission line only .",
    "while an additional resolved line is confidently detected in interval b at @xmath25.8  kev , the detection of the line at @xmath26.6  kev during interval a is less significant ( about 2.5@xmath1 ) .",
    "no line at @xmath26.6  kev is detected in interval b , as no line at @xmath25.8  kev is seen during interval a. however , if all broad line parameters are forced to be the same in the two intervals , the statistical quality of the fit becomes @xmath61 for 145 dof with respect to @xmath62 for 142 dof when the broad lines parameters are allowed to be different .",
    "the line profile variability is then significant at the @xmath298 per cent confidence level only ( we also point out that this significance level is likely overestimated since we do not take into account the number of trials for simplicity ) .",
    "we conclude that the data quality is not high enough to study the reflection and fe line variability in detail , although some tentative evidence for line profile variability is found on timescales @xmath6310  ks .    attempting to explain the tentative variability we report is risky ( because of its low significance ) and we do not want to over  interpret our data . however , assuming that the variability is real , the line appears to be more redshifted in the bright interval .",
    "this is opposite to the behaviour predicted e.g. by the light bending model ( see miniutti & fabian 2004 ) which , under the assumption that flux variability is only due to general relativistic effects , associates bright phases with narrower and less redshifted lines",
    ". however , other interpretations may be viable and the 5.8  kev line may be associated with the blue peak of an additional line component rather than with the red wing of the broad line ( which may be too weak to be confidently detected in the time  resolved intervals ) .",
    "for instance , the bright interval b could correspond to a particularly strong x  ray flare above the disc , disconnected from the overall variability trend , and illuminating only a limited off centre region of the disc .",
    "the irradiated region then responds with fe fluorescent line emission with peak energy ( and width ) dictated by the location and size of the illuminated spot ( doviak et al .",
    "2004 ) , as suggested e.g. by iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the case of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( see also iwasawa , miniutti & fabian 2004 for an interesting case of flux and energy modulation of such a feature in ngc  3516 ) .",
    "the 5.8  kev feature we observe during the bright interval b may than be due to a transient flare above the receding part of the inner disc , which potentially explains the relatively large observed redshift of the line .",
    "we detect with very high significance a broad fe line in the x  ray spectrum of the nls1 galaxy swift  j2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "the line is consistent with being relativistic and most likely originates in reflection from the innermost regions of the accretion disc , close to the central black hole .",
    "the good quality of our _ suzaku _ observation is sufficient to provide a measure of the black hole spin in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 , a relatively rare opportunity in agn studies .    the black hole in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 appears to be a rotating kerr black hole with an intermediate spin of @xmath64 .",
    "a non  rotating schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath49 ) is statistically rejected but just at the 3@xmath1 level , while a maximally rotating kerr one ( @xmath65 ) can be excluded at the 5@xmath1 level ( fig .  [ goodness ] ) . since a black hole having accreted a significant fraction of its mass should spin at very high rate ( volonteri et al 2005 ) accretion in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 might proceed through short episodes with random hole  disc angular momentum alignment .",
    "accretion could then either add or remove angular momentum depending on the relative orientation in each accretion episode .",
    "the current accretion episode should be short enough to prevent the hole from having accreted a significant fraction of its mass thus reaching maximal or nearly maximal spin .",
    "if we assume a typical efficiency of 0.1 , and given that swift  j2127.4 + 5654 has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath66  erg  s@xmath10 ( see table  1 ) for a black hole mass of @xmath67 , the black hole in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 can double its mass in about 0.2 - 0.3  gyr .",
    "this sets a conservative upper limit for the duration of the accretion episode that is powering the agn in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "we must point out that our spin measurement is based on the assumption that the reflecting disc is truncated at the isco .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , but can introduce a systematic error on the inferred spin value if the disc is truncated near but not exactly at the isco , i.e. if material in the plunging region beyond the isco can still act as a reflector with low enough ionization to produce an observable contribution to the reflection spectrum .",
    "recent numerical simulations suggest that the uncertainty in the reflector inner edge could at most reduce the spin we have inferred by @xmath68 ( reynolds & fabian 2008 ) .",
    "a lower black hole spin would only add strength to the previous argument , favouring short  lived accretion episodes in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 as opposed to prolonged accretion .",
    "given that counter ",
    "rotating discs spin down black holes more efficiently than co  rotating discs spin them up because gas particles leaving the isco to plunge towards the black hole have larger angular momenta in the counter ",
    "rotating case ( see bardeen 1970 ; bardeen , press & teukolsky 1972 ) , the black hole spin distribution in this scenario should be skewed towards low values .",
    "king , pringle & hofmann ( 2008 ) , who investigated in detail the effect of chaotic accretion episodes on the black hole spin , conclude indeed that the spin distribution for black holes of @xmath69 should peak around @xmath70 with a spread @xmath71 , broadly consistent with our measurement , especially if the correction due to the uncertainty in the reflector inner edge is considered .    the second relevant result we have obtained concerns the shape of the reflection emissivity profile .",
    "we measure a rather steep index @xmath3 with a 90 per cent lower limit @xmath72 . a powerful and centrally concentrated irradiating x  ray source is required to achieve such steep profiles , possibly related to the magnetic extraction of the black hole rotational energy via magnetic fields ( see e , g , wilms et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion ) .",
    "relativistic light bending may also contribute to focus the irradiating x ",
    "rays towards the innermost disc regions , thus inducing an effective steeper emissivity ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) . here",
    "we stress that the emissivity index @xmath73 and the black hole spin are somewhat degenerate in spectral fitting : as shown in fig .",
    "[ spincont ] , a steep emissivity profile tends to force low values of spin ( or large values of the inner radius ) .",
    "therefore , we detect a spin @xmath74 despite ( and not because of ) a steep emissivity .",
    "moreover , from a physical point of view , if the steep profile is indeed associated with the extraction of the black hole rotational energy ( plus light bending ) , steep emissivity profiles should only be obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "rotational energy extraction tends to reduce the black hole spin , thus representing a possible alternative to chaotic accretion as an explanation for the intermediate spin we measure .",
    "if we assume prolonged accretion ( which tends to force a maximally spinning hole ) and rotational energy extraction ( which tends to spin the hole down ) via the blandford & znajek ( bz ) mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , the black hole spin evolution is different than with accretion alone , and an equilibrium spin value is reached .",
    "it is interesting to note that moderski & sikora ( 1996 ) , who analysed in some detail the interplay between accretion and bz mechanism in building up the black hole spin , predict an equilibrium spin of @xmath76 if the current mass accretion rate ( in terms of eddington , see table  1 ) of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 and a standard @xmath4viscosity parameter of 0.1 are assumed .",
    "this estimate is actually remarkably consistent with our spin measurement .",
    "we then consider it plausible that accretion in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 is prolonged , but that the spin is limited by rotational energy extraction which may power the x  ray source .",
    "such occurence may explain simultaneously the spin value and the steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral analysis .",
    "the intermediate spin of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 is then consistent with two competing scenarios , namely i ) chaotic accretion episodes , or ii ) prolonged accretion plus rotational energy extraction via magnetic mechanisms .",
    "tentative line profile variability is seen on timescales @xmath6310  ks .",
    "confirming such short  timescale variability in this and other similar sources with broad lines would allow us to confidently rule out any competing spectral model ( such as complex absorption ) and to probe the relativistic regime around supermassive black holes .",
    "continuous data sets would be very helpful in assessing the variability on short timescales ( e.g. observations with _ xmm  newton _ ) .",
    "on the other hand , a very significant improvement in effective area at @xmath26  kev with respect to current observatories is necessary to probe the shortest timescales .",
    "considering that the xis  3 effective area is @xmath2220  @xmath77 at 6  kev , @xmath21  m@xmath78 is required to perform time  resolved spectroscopy of bright x  ray sources on timescales shorter than the orbital one in the inner disc .",
    "future missions such as the international x  ray observatory ( ixo ) will be ideal to probe without ambiguity and with great accuracy the accretion flow properties in the relativistic region .",
