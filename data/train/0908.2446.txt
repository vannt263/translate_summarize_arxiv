    "despite all the phenomenological success of the standard model ( sm ) , the large quantum corrections to the higgs potential require a fine tuning that makes it unnatural as a complete theory .",
    "this fine tuning is known as the hierarchy problem and can be avoided if there is new physics at the tev scale , the energy scale that will be explored at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "finding a solution to the hierarchy problem that can also be tested soon by the upcoming experiments at the lhc provides a very strong motivation for building extensions to the standard model .    a recent proposal that solves the hierarchy problem is the lee - wick standard model ( lwsm )  @xcite , based on ideas of lee and wick  @xcite for a finite theory of quantum electrodynamics . in the lwsm",
    "each sm particle has a lee - wick ( lw ) partner of the same statistics .",
    "the only new parameters of the model are the lw mass matrices .",
    "lw particles have a kinetic term with the opposite sign to the usual one for sm particles , leading to partial cancellations in loop corrections that eliminate quadratic divergences .",
    "different theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the lwsm have been discussed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a very interesting and distinctive feature of the lwsm is its acausal behavior .",
    "this might be a serious problem of the theory if acausal effects could persist to macroscopic scales , leading to paradoxes . for a general discussion of causality see coleman lectures , ref .",
    "it has been argued that if lw particles decay fast enough the violation of causality would happen on a very small time scale and macroscopic causality would still be preserved as an emergent property  @xcite .",
    "besides its phenomenological interest , lw - type theories also give the theoretical framework to discuss acausality .",
    "a lw version of the o(n ) model has been used to check the consistency of the acausal theory to all orders in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that there is a well - defined s - matrix in scattering processes , that provides a one - to - one map from the past to the future .",
    "although a similar result for the lwsm would be much more difficult to obtain , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is encouraging .",
    "the properties in thermal equilibrium have also been examined to further check if multiple scattering can lead to macroscopic acausal behavior  @xcite .",
    "the main question we address here is the following .",
    "given a theory that allows for microscopic violations of causality , but which is still free from paradoxes at the macroscopic level : is it possible to propose an observable that could reveal a microscopic violation of causality by solely analyzing the _ in _ and _ out _ states of the s - matrix ?",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative and to this purpose we define a _",
    "wrong vertex displacement _ as a vertex displacement in which the decay products coming from the secondary vertex have a total momentum that points from the secondary to the primary vertex and its invariant mass corresponds to a new resonance . as we discuss in the next section , acausal theories give rise to wrong vertex displacements .    as a direct application of the general question here addressed and the above defined observable , we analyze in this article the possibility of measuring a wrong vertex displacement as a signature of a lw resonance at the lhc .",
    "we investigate which lw particles could have the smallest widths to produce the largest wrong vertex displacements .    to answer this question we study in detail the flavor interactions of the leptonic sector in the lwsm .",
    "we obtain that if the lw sector satisfies minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , the best candidate to produce wrong displaced vertices is the lw electron associated to the su(2 ) doublet . in order to investigate the possibility of measuring a wrong vertex displacement at the lhc",
    ", we perform monte carlo simulations using madgraph / madevent @xcite to study which are the conditions such that there is a lw particle stable enough to produce an observable wrong vertex displacement .",
    "we find that for lw masses satisfying @xmath4 , these particles would produce displacements in the transverse plane greater than @xmath5 at cross - sections that would be measurable in the lhc era .",
    "another good candidate to produce observable wrong vertex displacements is the lw partner of the electron in the singlet representation of the gauge group .",
    "other lw particles seem to be out of the reach of the lhc for these purposes , but could still be observed by direct production , although it would be more difficult to discriminate them from other candidates of new physics .",
    "a wrong displaced vertex on the other hand , would be a characteristic signature for an acausal particle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - wvd ]",
    "we show that acausal resonances lead to wrong vertex displacements and argue that , in the lwsm , lw leptons are the best candidates to observe them . in section [ sec - flavor ]",
    "we analyze the flavor structure in the leptonic sector of the lwsm , and we obtain the mass eigenstates and the interactions in this basis . in section",
    "[ sec - stable ] we compute the widths for different lw - leptonic physical states and conclude that the first generation of lw - charged leptons will have a considerably smaller width than other lw particles . in section [ sec - experiment ]",
    "we discuss which are the necessary conditions to identify the desired events and we design a set of cuts and procedures to isolate our signal at the lhc .",
    "we end with our conclusions in section [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "details of the diagonalization of the leptonic mass matrix and the interactions between mass eigenstates can be found in the appendices .",
    "one of the main purposes of this article is to propose the measurement of wrong vertex displacement associated to processes that go through lw resonances at the lhc .",
    "a normal ( non - lw ) resonant state , produced by some initial particle collision , propagates typically for the space of time allowed by its mean lifetime before it decays into lighter particles . unlike the usual case ,",
    "the opposite occurs for lw resonances : decay products precede production .",
    "however , for the theory to be consistent it should forbid the temporal exploration of this time - scale . on the other hand , it is possible to probe spatially this acausal behavior by means of the detection of displaced decay vertices corresponding to relatively ` long - lived ' lw resonances and through the measurement of certain kinetic variables related to the decay products .    when a normal resonance is created with non - zero momentum , the total momentum of the decay products points from the decay point ( secondary vertex ) , in the outgoing direction from where the resonance was created ( primary vertex ) mesons .",
    "after these particles are created , they travel some distance in the laboratory frame before they decay .",
    "one can infer the time elapsed between the production and decay points to obtain a measure of the @xmath6 mesons mean lifetimes .",
    "this kind of measurements have been performed by using different techniques at lep , tevatron and the @xmath6 factories  @xcite . ] .",
    "of course , this is a direct consequence of the outgoing direction of the momentum of the resonance .    on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of lw or any acausal resonances may be detected by observing an opposite pattern : the resulting momentum of the decay products heads inwards , from the secondary towards the primary vertex .",
    "this particular behavior may be understood by means of a quantum mechanical argument as well as in a formal way using an s - matrix description . in the first case ,",
    "lee and wick  @xcite and coleman  @xcite have argued that , in a process going through a lw resonance in the center of mass frame , decay products would appear _ before _ collision takes place . in this picture ,",
    "incoming particles collide in the same spatial point where decay products come from",
    ". moreover , incoming and outgoing particles have zero total momentum in this frame of reference .",
    "if this whole process is boosted in some direction and its events are accordingly lorentz transformed , one easily retrieves the wrong displaced vertex described in the previous paragraph .",
    "( moreover , just a galileo transformation is enough for this purpose . )",
    "we show pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig : acausal ] this production and decay process mediated by an acausal resonance in both reference frames .",
    ", when the decay products appear before the lw resonance is created . at long times before and after the collision ( @xmath7 ) the configuration seems equivalent to the causal case , except that the extrapolated secondary vertex lies to the _ left _ of the primary vertex and the decay products move _ towards _ the primary vertex instead of away from it . as it is explained in the text , the same final result ( @xmath8 as an _ out _ state of a @xmath9 _ in _ state )",
    "is rigorously derived using the s - matrix formalism without inquiring what happens _ during _ the process , that is , without a microscopic description between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ]    alternatively , and in a more formal way , a recent paper by grinstein , oconnell and wise  @xcite may also help us to understand this behavior .",
    "they compute the transition amplitude between arbitrary two - particle states mediated by lw resonances using the s - matrix description of quantum field theory .",
    "the final result of this calculation , which corresponds to eq .",
    "( 46 ) in their paper , is the following    _ | _ ( -m / ) ( -m / ) e^i m e^- /2 .",
    "[ amplitude ] the relevant argument for our analysis lies in the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 which essentially contain the information about the distribution of momenta in the initial and final states , respectively . both @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are peaked around is satisfied by a causal resonances .",
    "( 34 ) in ref .  @xcite . ] @xmath14 , where @xmath15 stands for the total four - momentum of the incoming / outgoing particles , @xmath16 is the space - time separation between the positions of the decay ( @xmath17 ) and production ( @xmath18 ) vertices associated to the intermediate lw - resonant state , and @xmath19 represents its mass . due to the relative sign between @xmath15 and @xmath20 , the secondary vertex is displaced from the primary towards the opposite direction of @xmath15 .",
    "consider now the case where the total momentum of the incoming particles is different from zero in the laboratory reference frame , as for instance @xmath9 in the target frame in fig .",
    "[ fig : acausal ] .",
    "this means that if @xmath15 points towards the right in the figure , then the traces of the decay products should appear to come from a secondary vertex located at the _ left _ of the primary vertex , as it happens at @xmath8 in the target frame in fig .",
    "[ fig : acausal ] . as a matter of fact in an s - matrix description one has access only to these two times ( @xmath9 and @xmath8 ) , since it is senseless to inquire what happens _ during _ the process .",
    "this is the way the atypical displacement pattern of secondary vertices arises in scattering processes mediated by lw resonances in the s - matrix description .",
    "other consequences of eq .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) are further discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a last remark",
    ", we mention that this equation has been derived in the narrow resonance approximation which is valid in the case under study here ( typically , for a lw electron with m @xmath21 300 gev , we find @xmath22 gev ) .",
    "there is a point we should clarify in order to avoid misunderstandings in the interpretation of what we have discussed in the previous paragraphs . within the context of the s - matrix formalism",
    ", it does not make sense to rise the question about the time nor the position the vertices take place since we only deal with asymptotic states in this framework . in order to establish a proper connection between this theoretical approach and observations ,",
    "it is necessary to perform measurements far away from the region where the resonance propagates and at times well separated from the interval of time the propagation takes .",
    "these conditions are indeed satisfied at the lhc : measurements are carried out far outside the interaction region and within a relative long - time window that contains the entire process of creation and decay of the lw resonances .",
    "thus , the vertex positions are not measured ( in the sense that measurements do not perturb the dynamics of the system at the vertices ) but only indirectly obtained by extrapolating the traces left by the outgoing particles along the detectors .",
    "once we have justified how the lwsm ( or any theory with acausal particles ) could give rise to a wrong vertex displacement , we may focus on how this signature could be observed in this specific model .",
    "the first important question to address is about the existence of general reasons to expect a lw particle to have a very small width .",
    "the width is determined by the masses and the interactions between the particles involved in the decay process .",
    "present constrains on the lw masses coming from ewpt  @xcite indicate that the lowest allowed masses for lw quarks and lw - intermediate bosons are close to 3 tev , whereas the higgs sector is only constrained to have masses above @xmath23 gev @xcite . on the the other hand",
    ", there are no limits on lw - leptonic masses other than those coming from direct lepton search , which give a lowest bound of @xmath24 gev @xcite . besides the mass range difference between the lw leptons and the lw quarks , these last have the additional interaction with the gluon and the lw gluon .",
    "therefore , the lw quarks are expected to have a total width greater than the lw leptons .",
    "a similar reasoning holds for the lw - intermediate bosons , which have stronger constraints and prompt decays .",
    "hence , we conclude that lw leptons may be expected to be less unstable gev .",
    "although we have not performed the due analysis , we expect that the many decay channels open for the lw higgs would increase its width considerably above the one expected for the lw leptons . in any case",
    ", we clarify that this does not modify our results . ] and , therefore , the more propitious to give a wrong vertex displacement signature .",
    "the next important feature when explicitly analyzing the lwsm is that , since the creation of a single lw lepton @xmath0 is suppressed in this model , is more likely to observe two wrong displaced vertices than one .",
    "for instance in the process @xmath25 both @xmath0 s would produce wrong vertex displacements and hence their decay products @xmath26 and @xmath27 would have their respective total momentum pointing towards the primary vertex .",
    "this situation , as expected at the lhc , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .        in the next section we study the lw - leptonic sector in order to obtain the mass eigenstates that should be created to give the sought signal , and their interactions .",
    "the lwsm is usually formulated in terms of flavor eigenstates .",
    "the particle content of the fermion fields of the model is shown in table  [ table - particle - content ] .",
    "a generation index is omitted , however when along the text it is required to specify the generation , a corresponding sub - index will be added .",
    "the yukawa interactions mix the sm fields with the lw fields and are not diagonal in the generation space . in order to understand flavor issues in the lwsm , and to be able to determine which are the ` longest - lived ' acausal states , it is suitable to work in the mass eigenstates basis . with this objective ,",
    "in this section we first show how a change of basis may isolate the yukawa terms within each generation , and then how a second change of basis performed within each generation gives the final physical states .",
    "we finish with an analysis of the interactions resulting from these physical states .",
    ".fermionic fields in the lwsm .",
    "the neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the right handed neutrino @xmath28 does not have a lw partner .",
    "the dimension of the su(2 ) weak isospin representation is indicated in the last column .",
    "a generation subindex is omitted here , but it will be shown whenever necessary . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once created , each energetic lw lepton will mostly decay into a hard electron and @xmath29 ( we will consider @xmath30 gev from now on )",
    ". the electrons will have a very large @xmath31 because they are produced in a two body decay of a heavy lw lepton , and also because the lw state itself has a large @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath32 gev the @xmath31 distribution of the final hardest electron is centered in @xmath33 gev , whereas for @xmath34 gev is centered in @xmath35 gev , see fig .",
    "therefore , although the cut in the transverse momentum of the lw lepton suppresses the production cross section , at the same time , it allows us to impose hard cuts in the @xmath31 of the most energetic lepton , @xmath36 gev , with low impact in the signal",
    ". each @xmath29 gauge boson may decay leptonically or hadronically .",
    "the charged leptonic decay leads to a very clean final state , but has a small branching ratio , giving a cross section that is too small ( unless the lw leptons are very light ) .",
    "even the case where only one of the @xmath29 bosons decays leptonically may be out of reach , due to the small production cross section after the cut  ( [ cut - let ] ) , see table  [ table - production - xsect ] .",
    "the hadronic @xmath29 decay dominates , producing a jet pair for each vector .",
    "( choosing this decay channel reduces the cross section of table  [ table - production - xsect ] by approximately 50% . )",
    "therefore , the signal corresponding to the dominating channel is defined by a very energetic electron - positron pair and four jets : @xmath37 the intermediate @xmath29 will also have a large @xmath31 , and could give rise to collinear jets , with small angular separation . in this case both jets could be resolved as a single jet .",
    "each pair of jets with an invariant mass corresponding to the @xmath29 , when considered together with the proper lepton @xmath38 , will have an invariant mass peaked around the lw - lepton mass .",

    "the backgrounds for the signal here presented do not seem to cause further complications .",
    "however , a detailed sm background analysis should be performed to verify that the whole luminosity for the @xmath43 signal data with a suitable cut in the electrons transverse momentum of @xmath44 gev can be collected to perform an off - line analysis ( this is known as an un - prescaled trigger ) .",
    "afterwards , the peculiarity of this signal would need a proper vertexing algorithm to cope with the correct wrong vertex assignment .",
    "in this article we have defined a new signature called _ wrong vertex displacement _ which is a distinctive and model independent signal for new acausal resonances . microscopic violation of causality is a feature of the lee - wick standard model  @xcite , a well motivated model that can solve the hierarchy problem of the sm .",

    "we have made a detailed analysis of flavor in the leptonic sector of the lwsm .",
    "we obtained that assuming mfv the dominant decay channels of the charged lw leptons @xmath45 and @xmath46 are suppressed by the small charged yukawa couplings , leading to tiny widths for the first generation of lw electrons ( relaxing mfv in the leptonic sector leads to much larger widths , thus we do not expect to obtain measurable vertex displacements in that case ) . for lw lepton masses of the same order",
    ", @xmath47 , the best lw candidate to produce a wrong vertex displacement at the lhc is the lw electron associated to the su(2 ) doublet , @xmath45 .",
    "the lw electron singlet @xmath46 could also produce measurable wrong displaced vertices , although the production cross section is somewhat smaller due to the larger width compared with the previous case .",
    "the @xmath46 decays predominantly through cc interactions to @xmath48 , leading to a final state with large missing energy and making it impossible to reconstruct the mass of the intermediate resonances .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo simulation and computed the cross - section to pair produce @xmath45 s which could generate wrong vertex displacement greater than @xmath49 .",
    "our result is that for lw - leptonic masses satisfying @xmath50 gev it would be possible to observe wrong vertex displacements in the lhc era .",
    "the most promising final state is defined by @xmath39 , with highly boosted electrons and the jets coming from the hadronic decay of a pair of @xmath29 gauge bosons .",
    "this final state allows the reconstruction of the lw - leptonic masses .",
    "although a full simulation analysis is needed , our study remarkably shows that low luminosities could confirm this signal : demanding five events would require an integrated luminosity of 1 ( 3 ) fb@xmath51 for @xmath52 ( 400 ) gev .",
    "the observation of this signal would point to the existence of acausal resonances , whereas its non - observation would not rule out models with this kind of particles , but could put lower bounds on the lw scale and give us information about the flavor structure of this particular model .",
