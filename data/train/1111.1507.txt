    "spin resistivity in materials has been a subject of intensive studies both experimentally and theoretically for more than five decades .",
    "experiments have been performed to determine the spin resistivity @xmath0 in many magnetic materials from metals to semiconductors .",
    "the rapid development of the field is due mainly to many applications in particular in spintronics .",
    "one interesting aspect of magnetic materials is the existence of a magnetic phase transition from a magnetically ordered phase to the paramagnetic ( disordered ) state . depending on the material ,",
    "@xmath0 can show a sharp peak at the magnetic transition temperature @xmath1,@xcite or just only a change of its slope , or an inflexion point .",
    "the latter case gives rise to a peak of the differential resistivity @xmath2.@xcite very recent experiments such as those performed on ferromagnetic srruo@xmath3 thin films@xcite , ru - doped induced ferromagnetic la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath3@xcite , antiferromagnetic @xmath6-(mn@xmath7fe@xmath8)@xmath9ge@xcite , semiconducting pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath3 thin films@xcite , superconducting bafe@xmath12as@xmath12 single crystals@xcite , and la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath3@xcite compounds show different forms of anomaly of the magnetic resistivity at the magnetic phase transition temperature .",
    "the properties of the total resistivity stem from different kinds of diffusion processes : the scattering of the itinerant spins by phonons , by lattice magnons , by impurities and defects etc .",
    "each contribution has in general a different temperature dependence .",
    "let us summarize the most important contributions at low temperature ( @xmath13 ) in the following expression @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "the first term is @xmath13-independent , the second term proportional to @xmath18 represents the scattering of itinerant spins at low @xmath13 by lattice spin - waves .",
    "note that the resistivity caused by a fermi liquid is also proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 term corresponds to low-@xmath13 resistivity in metals .",
    "this is due to the scattering of itinerant electrons by phonons .",
    "note that at high @xmath13 , metals show a linear-@xmath13 dependence .",
    "the @xmath20 term is the resistivity due to the quantum kondo effect at very low @xmath13 . for the magnetic contribution to the total resistivity",
    ", the @xmath18 term has been obtained from the magnon scattering by kasuya@xcite . however ,",
    "at high @xmath13 in particular in the region of the phase transition , much less has been known .",
    "the general idea that the magnetic resistivity is a function of the spin - spin correlation was introduced by de gennes and friedel.@xcite according to this idea , the magnetic resistivity should behave as the magnetic susceptibility , thus it should diverge at @xmath1 .",
    "fisher and langer@xcite , and kataoka@xcite have suggested that the range of spin - spin correlation changes the shape of @xmath0 near the phase transition . the resistivity due to magnetic impurities has been calculated by zarand et al.@xcite as a function of the anderson s localization length .",
    "this parameter expresses in fact a kind the correlation sphere induced around each impurity .",
    "their result that the resistivity peak depends on this parameter is in agreement with the spin - spin correlation idea . in our previous works@xcite we have studied the spin current in ferromagnetic thin films by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . the behavior of the spin resistivity as a function of @xmath13 has been shown to be in agreement with main experimental features and theoretical investigations mentioned above .",
    "we have introduced in these works the picture of scattering of itinerant spins by magnetic defect clusters which are known to be formed in the transition temperature region .",
    "the size of each defect cluster expresses a kind of correlation between spins .    in antiferromagnets much less",
    "is known because there have been very few theoretical investigations which have been carried out .",
    "haas@xcite has shown that while in ferromagnets the resistivity @xmath0 shows a sharp peak at the magnetic transition of the lattice spins , in antiferromagnets there is no such a peak .",
    "the alternate change of sign of the spin - spin correlation with distance may have something to do with the absence of a sharp peak .    in this paper , we are interested in the antiferromagnetic mnte , a well - studied semiconductor with numerous applications due to its high nel temperature .",
    "the pure mnte has either the zinc - blend structure@xcite or the hexagonal nias one@xcite .",
    "we confine ourselves in the case of hexagonal structure .",
    "for this case , the nel temperature is @xmath21 k@xcite .",
    "hexagonal mnte is a crossroad semiconductor with a big gap ( 1.27 ev ) and a room - temperature carrier concentration of @xmath22@xmath23.@xcite without doping , mnte is non degenerate . in doped",
    "cases@xcite , band tails created by doped impurities can cover more or less the gap .",
    "but these systems , which are disordered by doping , are not a purpose of our present study .",
    "so , in the following we study only the pure mnte .",
    "the behavior of the spin resistivity @xmath0 in mnte as a function of @xmath13 has been experimentally shown@xcite . in our previous paper,@xcite",
    "we have theoretically studied with the boltzmann s equation using numerical data for cluster distribution obtained by mc simulations .",
    "we could only compare our result with old experimental data available at that time below the transition temperature.@xcite after the publication of our paper , new experimental results become available for the whole range of temperature for pure mnte performed by he et al.@xcite this motivates the present work .    in this paper",
    ", we use the same model as in our previous work@xcite for mnte .",
    "but unlike that previous paper which used an approximate boltzmann s equation , we shall use here direct mc simulations without recourse to approximations .",
    "in addition , we take into account the lattice magnetic relaxation time in the calculation of the spin resistivity .",
    "the tuning of the relaxation time allows an excellent agreement with experimental resistivity of mnte as will be seen below .    in section [ model ]",
    ", we show our model and describe our mc method .",
    "results are shown and compared with experimental resistivity of mnte in section [ result ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ conclu ] .    ,",

    "the hexagonal nias - type structure of mnte is shown in fig .",
    "1.@xcite it is composed of ferromagnetic @xmath26 hexagonal planes antiferromagnetically stacked in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) distance in the @xmath27 direction is @xmath28 @xmath29 shorter than the in - plane nn distance which is @xmath30 .",
    "neutron scattering experiments show that the main exchange interactions between mn spins in mnte are i ) interaction between nn along the @xmath27 axis with the value @xmath31 k , ii ) ferromagnetic exchange @xmath32 between in - plane neighboring mn ( they are next nn by distance ) , iii ) third nn antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath33 k.    the interactions @xmath34 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are indicated in fig .",
    "in addition , the spins are lying in the @xmath26 planes perpendicular to the @xmath27 direction with a small in - plane easy - axis anisotropy @xmath35.@xcite we note that the values of the exchange integrals given above have been deduced from experimental data by fitting with a formula obtained from a free spin - wave theory@xcite . other fittings with mean - field theories",
    "give slightly different values.@xcite therefore , care should be taken while using values deduced from experimental data , keeping in mind that they depend on models used and approximations involved in the fitting .",
    "the lattice hamiltonian is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the heisenberg spin at the lattice site @xmath38 , @xmath39 is made over the nn spin pairs @xmath37 and @xmath40 with interaction @xmath34 , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are made over the nnn and third nn neighbor pairs with interactions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "@xmath43 is an anisotropy constant which favors the in - plane @xmath44 easy - axis spin configuration .",
    "the mn spin is experimentally known to be of the heisenberg model with magnitude @xmath45.@xcite    the interaction between an itinerant spin and surrounding mn spins in semiconducting mnte is written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the itinerant spin @xmath48 at @xmath49 and the mn spin @xmath50 at the lattice site @xmath51 .",
    "the sum on lattice spins @xmath50 is limited at some cut - off distance as will be discussed later .",
    "we suppose that @xmath52 is weak enough to be considered as a perturbation to the lattice hamiltonian :    @xmath53\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants .",
    "we choose @xmath56 for convenience .",
    "the choice of @xmath54 should be made so that the interaction @xmath57 yields an energy much smaller than the lattice energy due to @xmath58 ( see discussion on the choice of variables in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    since in mnte",
    "the carrier concentration is @xmath22@xmath23 , low with respect to the concentration of its surrounding lattice spins @xmath59@xmath23 , we do not take into account the interaction between itinerant spins .",
    "the contribution of that interaction to the energy of an itinerant spin is negligible .",
    "we perform mc simulations on a thin film of dimension @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of mnte cells in @xmath44 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 directions .",
    "note that each cell contains two mn atoms and two te atoms ( see fig . [ nias ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions .",
    "the itinerant electrons move in the system under an electric field @xmath64 applied along the @xmath44 direction @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the charge of electron and @xmath67 the displacement vector of the electron .",
    "each electron spin @xmath48 of magnitude @xmath68 interacts with neighboring lattice mn spins within a sphere of radius @xmath69 according to eq .",
    "( [ interact ] ) .",
    "we take in the following the ising model for the electron spin . in doing so",
    ", we neglect the quantum effects which are of course important at very low temperature but not in the transition region at room temperature where we focus our attention .",
    "the mc technique we use for the transport is a multi - step averaging which has shown to reduce efficiently statistical fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to our early works for a detailed description of our method as well as the effects of changing physical parameters such as @xmath69 in antiferromagnets . in a word ,",
    "this technique consists in changing the lattice spin configuration as often as the temperature - dependent relaxation time allows .",
    "the relaxation time of the lattice spin system is expressed as@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath15 is a constant , @xmath71 the correlation critical exponent , and @xmath63 the dynamic exponent . from this expression",
    ", we see that as @xmath13 tends to @xmath72 , @xmath73 diverges .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the critical slowing - down .",
    "for the heisenberg model , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76).@xcite we have previously shown that @xmath73 strongly affects the shape of @xmath0.@xcite",
    "we have calculated the spin resistivity of the hexagonal mnte using the exchange integrals taken from ref .",
    "these values are given above .",
    "as said before , the values of the exchange interactions deduced from experimental data depend on the model hamiltonian , in particular the spin model , as well as the approximations .",
    "furthermore , in semiconductors , the carrier concentration is a function of @xmath13 . in our model",
    ", there is however no interaction between itinerant spins .",
    "therefore , the number of itinerant spins used in the simulation is important only for statistical average : the larger the number of itinerant spins the better the statistical average .",
    "the current obtained is proportional to the number of itinerant spins but there are no extra physical effects .",
    "the result of the spin resistivity is shown in fig .",
    "[ rmnte ] . using the value of @xmath0",
    ", we obtain the relaxation time of itinerant spin equal to @xmath77 ps , and the mean free path equal to @xmath78 , at the critical temperature .     versus temperature @xmath13 .",
    "black circles are from monte carlo simulation , white circles are experimental data taken from he et al.@xcite . the parameters used in the simulation are @xmath79k , @xmath80 k , @xmath81 k , @xmath82 k , @xmath83 k , @xmath84 , @xmath85 v / m , @xmath86.,width=302 ]    several remarks are in order :    \\i ) with @xmath25 slightly larger in magnitude than the value deduced from experiments , we find @xmath21 k    \\ii ) @xmath0 shows a pronounced peak in excellent agreement with experiments    \\iii ) note that the shape of the peak depends on @xmath15 .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the magnetization deficit may be due to the fact that the magnetic anisotropy was too small @xmath83 k taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not strong enough to enhance the magnetization .",
    "( in unit of @xmath91 ) versus temperature @xmath13 ( in unit of k ) .",
    "black circles are results of monte carlo simulation , white circles are experimental data taken from efrem dsa et al.@xcite .",
    "the parameters are the same as those given in the caption of fig .",
    "we have shown in this paper the mc results of the spin resistivity @xmath0 as a function of temperature in mnte . we have taken into account the main interaction which governs the resistivity behavior , namely the interaction between itinerant spins and the lattice mn spins .",
    "our result is in agreement with experiments : it reproduces the correct nel temperature as well as the shape of the peak at the phase transition .",
    "note that the theory by haas@xcite predicts the absence of a peak in @xmath0 in the temperature region of the phase transition for antiferromagnetic mnte .",
    "we finally emphasize that our excellent agreement was possible because most importantly we have correctly taken into account the temperature dependence of the lattice spin relaxation time in the simulation.@xcite      f. matsukura , h. ohno , a. shen and y. sugawara , phys .",
