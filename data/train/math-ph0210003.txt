    "there are papers ( see s. b. leble ( 1991 ) for a review ) in which the problem of nonlinear waves evolution in stratified medium is in some way connected with soliton theory , see , e.g. , novikov et al ( 1984 ) .",
    "we mean the conditions in which the physical ( or environmental ) conditions need account of nonlinearity and dispersion which joint action is of essential ( sometimes - inevitable ) importance .",
    "evolution of internal gravity waves ( igw ) in geophysical hydrodynamics and its further decay to turbulent spots is important example of such phenomena , pedlosky ( 1979 ) .",
    "the scenarios of this transition intensely discussed in literature of atmosphere and ocean physics gavrilov , fukao , nakamura , tsuda ( 1996 ) .",
    "there are also publications about laboratory experiments devoted to igw dynamics in tanks segur , finkel ( 1985 ) .",
    "the problem have a link to a general problems of hydrodynamics as illustrated by zeitunyan ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is the euler equations used as a basis of a description in which modes with different scales are generated within the process of a wave propagation over an initial density stratification taking into account its possible dynamic changes .",
    "this question relates to the behavior of a solution within the limiting procedure when a dispersion coefficient go to zero . in our case of internal waves",
    "it means the zero buoyancy frequency limit ( @xmath0 ) that in turn is proportional to the vertical density gradient .",
    "let us mention also investigations of similar problems with a small dispersion parameter initiated by lax and levermore ( 1983 ) for the model of a single korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "the dispersion in such model is described by the term with third derivative by a coordinate ( x ) .    in this paper",
    "we study an evolution of a disturbance from an initial condition that model an excitation of the internal wave in the geometry and scales of mcewan ( 1983 a , b ) experiments .",
    "we believe that the fine structures that appear in density distribution may be explained by a model based on a system of coupled koreweg - de vries ( ckdv ) equations .",
    "this system arises for coefficient functions related to a functional basis of transversal coordinate .",
    "it demonstrates the behaviors of solutions that have many features of multi - solitonic decay ( see , again , novikov et al ( 1984 ) ) the wavetrains contain chains of such fluctuations of basic wave variables that propagate with velocity up to the most quick one .",
    "our investigations show : interaction between the basic transverse guide modes does not destroy the general picture ; only some phase changes appear .",
    "of course the system of ckdv has higher order in time derivatives , the opposite directed wave train is launched , but the wave also has the multisoliton form .",
    "the derivation of the system of ckdv may be considered as the direct application of galerkin - bubnov projection procedures that is successfully used in numerical simulation of initial - boundary problems with a good mathematical justification ( the basis of this method are in gottlieb and orszag ( 1989 ) , see , also moser ( 1966 ) ) . after the variables division in the linearized problem some spectral problem appears .",
    "its eigen functions of transverse variables form a basis . hence",
    "the ( infinite ) 1 + 1 ckdv system is equivalent to the 2 + 1 basic euler system under consideration within some class of initial conditions . while numeric simulation delivering we cut this infinite system restricting ourselves by some mode number , comparing few such examples .",
    "we , however believe that further extending of the system does not change the general behavior of the wavetrains .",
    "we plan checking of the hypothesis in the forthcoming paper but more concentrate now on the ckdv model that is also interesting by itself ( e.g. hirota r. , satsuma j. ( 1981 ) , a. perelomova ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "it was studied mathematically via many approaches as described recently by ayse karasu ( 1997 ) .",
    "there are integrable examples",

    "3 ) and use it for numerical integration .",
    "the theorems about convergence and stability we formulate and prove here confirm the statements we made . the computations description we place in the section 4 and the proofs in appendix .",
    "in this article we do not touch the mixing problems in its full extent as well as interaction with the stratification mode ( background or stationary state ) itself .",
    "such problems solution need account of boundary conditions and simulations for a longer time intervals .",
    "account of such ingredients in the model could shade the main phenomena we intend to demonstrate .",
    "therefore we concentrate attention of a reader on the initial stage of the wave field development . already within this initial stage period",
    "the horizontal multi - solitonic fine structure prevails : it seems very important .",
    "our general approach and the numerical scheme power allow to consider longer time to account reflections phenomena .",
    "a comparison of the evaluated stream function fields with ones of the mcewan experiments show many similar features , that , seems to verify the model from the point of the real fluid dynamics .",

    "the number may be increased but at the times we consider the effect of small - vertical - scales modes generation may be neglected . returning to the general significance in the theory of the euler equations validity mentioned in the introduction , one can easily put the important question .",
    "the question arises when we analyze the expressions for the constants in the of equations ckdv system . in a limit of the homogeneous medium , or @xmath94 , the nonlinear constant increase while the dispersion and velocities go to zero .",
    "it means the growth of solitons number and more strong interaction between modes .",
