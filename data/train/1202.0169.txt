    "@xcite that in zero magnetic field ( @xmath42 ) the model ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) has generically a stable 2ck fixed point for a wide range of parameters .",
    "the 2ck phase occurs , because the excited state doublet of the non - interacting impurity is down - renormalized by kondo - like interactions below the non - interacting ground state and the system must then flow to a stable 2ck fixed point .",
    "the kondo state is formed due to the unbroken su(2 ) subgroup of su(3 ) within the ( initially excited ) doublet of the three - level system .",
    "moreover , it was shown that spikes in the differential conductance at finite bias voltage arise from kondo - enhanced transitions between the ground and the excited states @xcite .",
    "these spikes are analogous to the well - known kondo satellite resonances observed in rare - earth kondo impurities with several , crystal - field split , local orbitals @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the rim the 2ck kondo temperature is not reduced by charge screening effects : the charge of any impurity is screened by the conduction electrons . in a tls in a double - well potential",
    "the spatial charge density distribution is coupled to the presumed kondo pseudospin degree of freedom and is altered by a pseudospinflip process .",
    "therefore , only those low - energy electrons participate in the kondo scattering which can not screen the flipping tls charge distribution instantaneously . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this reduces the energy range available for kondo scattering from the bare conduction bandwidth to the tls tunneling frequency and , thus , suppresses @xmath3 .",
    "by contrast , within the rim kondo scattering occurs within space - inversion symmetric roton doublets which alters the phase , but not the charge density distribution of the system .",
    "therefore , charge density and kondo degree of freedom are independent , and @xmath3 is not influenced by charge screening .",
    "moreover , to realize a 2ck regime in the rim it is not necessary to invoke transitions via higher excited states in order to enhance @xmath3 over the level splitting of the doublet  which can be prevented by the alternating parity of the higher excited states @xcite .",
    "this is because in the rim the excited - state doublet is degenerate by space inversion symmetry and because , in any case , a possible level splitting @xmath14 and the kondo couplings @xmath43 , @xmath44 are independent parameters . hence",
