    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory has serious issues on galactic and sub - galactic mass scales , even though it has been successful in interpreting a multitude of observational phenomena at cosmological scales .",
    "these include the so - called missing satellite , core / cusp discrepancy , and too - big - to - fail ( tbtf ) problems .",
    "one of the possible mechanisms to resolve these problems within the cdm paradigm is to rely on the effects of baryonic process such as the photoionization of neutral gas with uv background and the impact of gas outflow mainly due to mainly supernova feedback on dark halo structures .",
    "more radically , a possible solution that is well motivated from particle physics is to replace cdm with warm dark matter ( wdm ) .",
    "the main difference between cdm and wdm is that while cdm particles have negligible thermal velocities , wdm ones have significant thermal velocities during the era of structure formation and thus these particles have a free - streaming length , giving rise to a cutoff matter power spectrum at larger wave numbers corresponding to small spatial scales .",
    "the possible wdm candidates are the sterile neutrino  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) or the gravitino  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these candidates would have a mass in a few kev , leading to the suppression of structures on dwarf - galaxy mass scales .",
    "therefore , since the cutoff wavelength depends on the particle mass , investigating the nature of dark halo structures at low - mass scales leads to useful limits on the wdm particle mass , @xmath2 .",
    "one of the powerful tools for constraining the wdm particle mass is ly@xmath3 forest observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations allow us to study a matter power spectrum down to small scales and over a large redshift range . @xcite",
    "have observed the flux power spectrum of ly@xmath3 using the high - resolution spectra and have compared it to predicted ones from high - resolution @xmath4-body and hydrodynamical simulations , assuming that wdm masses are 1 , 2 , and 4 kev .",
    "they concluded that in order to reproduce the observed power spectrum , wdm particles are required to have a lower limit of @xmath5  kev ( @xmath6 confidence level ) .",
    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies also provide useful tests to distinguish between cdm and wdm or set constraints on particle mass of wdm .",
    "first , based on the difference of dark matter concentration between cdm and wdm subhalos , reproducing the maximum circular velocity of the milky way ( mw ) satellites can distinguish dark matter scenarios .",
    "this test is linked to the tbtf problem in cdm .",
    "@xcite  performed @xmath4-body simulations with wdm and presented that the tbtf problem does not exist within the frameworks of wdm .",
    "also , @xcite  showed that a wdm particle mass less than 4  kev can mitigate the tbtf problem in high - resolution simulations .",
    "the second test is the method to resolve the missing satellite problem .",
    "based on the difference of the abundance of subhalos within a host cdm and wdm dark halo , @xcite found a conservative lower limit of @xmath7  kev in each @xmath4-body simulation .",
    "however , these tests largely rely on the mass of the mw halo , where the estimates of the mw halo mass is still very uncertain with mass ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9  ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the case of the tbtf problem , cdm models can resolve the issue if the mass of the mw halo is less than @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "for the abundance of subhalos , if the mw halo mass is heavier than @xmath11 , only masses of wdm particles greater than 2  kev are accepted  @xcite . because of the dependence on the assumed mw halo mass and the uncertainty in it , the two tests above using the dwarf satellites are not yet sufficient to confine cdm or wdm scenarios .    in this letter , as yet another test on this issue from dwarf - galaxy scales , we revisit and consider the dark matter surface density , which appears nearly constant and independent of galaxy luminosity discovered by previous studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we propose that the re - definition and adoption of this surface density estimated within a radius of maximum circular velocity directly allow us to obtain the limits on particle masses of wdm .",
    "this work is in part based on the kinematical analysis of the mw and andromeda ( m31 ) dsphs , for which more detailed descriptions will be presented elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) .",
    "recently , analyzing the data of velocity dispersions , rotation curves of hi gas , and weak lensing for samples of dsph , dwarf irregular , spiral , and elliptical galaxies , @xcite and @xcite fitted these data based on cored dark matter density profiles , such as the burkert and pseudo - isothermal profiles , and found that the product of the central core density and core radius , @xmath12 , which is proportional to the central dark matter surface density , is constant for all these galaxies .",
    "while these works offer us important suggestions on the universality of the dark halo structure , we note that this definition of @xmath12 can not be applied directly to a system with a cusped density profile .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath14 in such a case may be defined in a specific way depending on an assumed density profile , so there exists some ambiguities when we compare surface densities between different systems and also compare with predictions from cdm or wdm .    to adequately compare dark matter distributions being independent of their density profiles",
    ", we introduce a mean surface density of a dark halo within a radius of maximum circular velocity , @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 indicates any dark matter density profiles , and @xmath18 is a radius at maximum circular velocity , @xmath19 , of assumed dark halo profiles , @xmath20 . the surface density defined in equation  ( [ svmax ] )",
    "is exactly proportional to the central dark matter surface density , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the central density and scale length of arbitrary dark halo profiles , respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath18 is a better - defined scale than a core radius , @xmath14 , because the latter is uncertain for a cuspy density profile : @xmath14 may be defined as a half - mass radius or some fraction of it in such a case , but it then suffers from the ambiguity of at what outer boundary the halo is tidally limited , e.g. , the navarro  frenk white ( nfw ) profile having a diverging total mass .    , within a radius at maximum circular velocity , @xmath19 , as a function of @xmath19 for different galaxies and hubble types . while the inset shows all of the samples as well as cdm ( _ wmap7 _ ) prediction , the main panel highlights the plots only at @xmath24  km  s@xmath1 .",

    "blue and red triangles are the original @xcite sample of spiral galaxy data and nearby spirals in things  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the data for dwarf irregular galaxies are indicated by green circles , and spirals and ellipticals investigated by weak lensing are labeled by black squares .",
    "solid lines show the results of cdm models with different cosmological parameters of _ wmap7 _ ( dark green ) and _ planck _ ( orange ) measurements .",

    "we analyze the stellar kinematics in the seven mw ( carina , fornax , sculptor , sextans , draco , leo  i , and leo  ii ) and five m31 ( and  i , and  ii , and  iii , and  v , and and  vii ) dsphs and construct axisymmetric mass models for these dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation , which considers more generalized models than our previous work , @xcite ) .",
    "for all samples , except for dsphs , we use the dark halo parameters ( central density and core radius ) estimated by the above original papers .    for dsphs",
    ", we employ the axisymmetric jeans equations as in @xcite , but we consider the effect of an additional velocity anisotropy of tracer stars , @xmath26 , to determine the global shape of a dark halo , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are velocity dispersions of stars in cylindrical coordinates ( see ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) , for more details ) . together with @xmath29",
    ", we adopt an inner slope of the dark halo density profile as a free parameter as well as the parameterization of central density and scale length of a dark halo , apply our models to the two - dimensional line - of - sight velocity dispersion map for the above dsphs , and obtain the best - fit dark halo parameters .",
    "we have found that whilst most of the dsphs have cored or shallower cusped dark halos , the draco , leo  i , and  iii , and and  v dsphs show a steep inner density slope ; not all of the dsphs have cored density profiles in their dark halos , as already suggested in @xcite .    the symbols with error bars in figure  [ svmax2map ]",
    "show the estimated @xmath25 of the above data sample as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "it is found that even though dark halos in each galaxy sample are assumed to have different mass profiles ( cusp or core ) and are estimated by independent methods , the dark matter surface density within @xmath18 is sufficiently _ constant _ across a wide range of galaxy masses .",
    "we discuss probable systematic uncertainties for the disk and dsph galaxies , respectively . for the disk galaxies ,",
    "we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the adopted stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath30 , on @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite assumed the three @xmath30s and fitted dark halo parameters for each assumption . adopting these parameters",
    ", we confirm that these uncertainties in @xmath30 do not largely affect the estimation of @xmath25 , varying it by a factor of three at maximum . for dsphs , we consider the influences of baryonic components and the velocity anisotropy of stars on the estimation of @xmath25 .",
    "since the fraction of the stellar mass in the total mass of the dsphs is so small , ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , that the estimated values of @xmath25 may not at least change beyond a factor of 10 , even if these small effects of baryonic components are taken into account . in our models , we assume a _ constant _ velocity anisotropy of their member stars and find that this anisotropy is almost independent of other model parameters , such as a central density and scale length as well as an inner slope of a dark halo  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) .",
    "therefore , the observational evidence for the constancy of @xmath25 is robust .",
    "the use of the dark matter surface density defined by using @xmath19 and @xmath18 allows us to compare the results from the data sample with those from cosmological @xmath4-body simulations within the @xmath33-dominated cdm and wdm models .",
    "we calculate @xmath25 from the outcomes of the @xmath4-body simulations as follows .",
    "first , we adopt the nfw dark matter density profile : @xmath34 which can reproduce cdm  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wdm  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dark halos within a wide halo mass range .",
    "second , we calculate the scale density , @xmath35 , and virial radius , @xmath36 , for a nfw dark halo at the present time ( @xmath37 ) from cosmological context : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a so - called virial overdensity at @xmath37  @xcite , @xmath40 is a concentration parameter defined as @xmath41 , @xmath42 is a critical density of the current universe , and @xmath43 denotes the hubble constant at @xmath37 .",
    "third , using the mass  concentration relation ( mcr ) for a dark halo , we obtain the scale radius , @xmath44 . for cdm models , we adopt two different mcrs at @xmath37 based on @xmath4-body simulations with slightly different cosmological parameters : @xmath45 & &   \\nonumber \\\\   { \\rm ( for\\hspace{2mm}wmap7 ) } & & ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "c_{\\rm p } = 10.7\\bigr(\\frac{m_{\\rm vir}}{10^{12}h^{-1}m_{\\odot}}\\bigl)^{-0.11 } \\bigr[1 + \\bigr(\\frac{m_{\\rm vir}}{2.4\\times10^{16}h^{-1}m_{\\odot}}\\bigl)^{0.4}\\bigl]&&\\nonumber   \\\\   { \\rm ( for\\hspace{2mm}planck ) } & &   \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "the mcr with cosmological parameters of _ wmap7 _ is derived by  @xcite , whilst another one is found by  @xcite . for wdm models ,",
    "we adopt the method to derive mcr using the power spectra developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s14 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the power spectrum of wdm models , the transfer function formula of the wdm universe by @xcite is adopted : @xmath47^{-5/\\mu},\\ ] ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49^{-1.11}\\bigr[\\frac{\\omega_{\\rm wdm}}{0.25}\\bigl]^{0.11 } \\bigr[\\frac{h}{0.7}\\bigl]^{1.22 } \\hspace{3 mm } h^{-1}{\\rm mpc},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a wavenumber and @xmath51 denotes a cosmological density parameter for wdm .",
    "then , the _ linear _ power spectrum in the case of wdm is derived by @xmath52 using the above power spectrum and mcr s fitting function described by equation ( 24 ) in @xcite , mcrs in the case of 2 and 3  kev particle masss of wdm are derived by comparing with the @xmath4-body simulations ( see s14 for more details ) .",
    "figure  [ cmvir ] displays the mcrs derived from cdm models with _ planck _",
    "data and wdm models with 2 and 3  kev particle masses at redshift 0 .",
    "while cdm models predict that a concentration parameter monotonically increases with decreasing halo mass , wdm halos have a clear turnover at a low - mass halo .    finally , using the dark matter density profiles obtained by the above procedure",
    ", we compute @xmath19 and @xmath18 , and then calculate @xmath25 for cdm ( _ wmap _ and _ planck _ ) and wdm ( particle masses of 2 and 3  kev ) models .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in figure  [ svmax2map ] are predicted @xmath25 versus @xmath19 for four cases of the dark matter models .",
    "we emphasize that , surprisingly , these theoretical lines can well reproduce the data at high - mass scales , even though we do not perform any fitting to the data ; actually , the data points ( including low - mass scales ) appear slightly above even the theoretical line giving the highest @xmath25 ( cdm with _ planck",
    "_ parameters ) , which may suggest there are still some uncertainties in structural parameters for dark halos or even cosmology , but the following results for the limit of wdm remain unaffected . for all mass ranges ,",
    "cdm scenarios give a reasonable match to the data , where the results based on _ wmap _ and _ planck _ data are not so different at low - mass scales .",
    "this is only due to the slight effect of the difference of cosmological parameters on the concentration of dark halos . in particular , @xmath19 or @xmath18",
    "can depend on both the rms amplitude of linear mass fluctuation in a sphere of @xmath53  mpc , @xmath54 , and the spectral index of the initial power spectrum , @xmath55 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "wdm ones are inconsistent with the universality of @xmath25 at dwarf - galaxy mass scales .",
    "this different feature between cdm and wdm models at the low - mass end stems from the properties of the halo concentrations at low halo - mass scales . from figure  [ cmvir ] ,",
    "the concentrations of wdm halos differ substantially from those of cdm halos at low halo - mass scales , thereby the value of @xmath25 decreases prominently at small @xmath19 corresponding to dwarf galaxies .",
    "we also investigate how far wdm models deviate from the data .",
    "figure  [ sver ] is the same as figure  [ svmax2map ] , but zooms in the dwarf - galaxy scale and plots @xmath56 and @xmath57 error areas of each sample .",
    "focusing on @xmath58",
    "km  s@xmath1 where the difference in @xmath25 emerges significantly , even a 3  kev particle mass of wdm appears to deviate beyond a @xmath56 error in our sample .",
    "following this result , in order to be in agreement with the universality of @xmath25 from the data , wdm particles need to be heavier than 3  kev .",
    ", but for dsphs only .",
    "black and gray shaded regions are @xmath56 and @xmath57 error areas , respectively , for each sample.,width=302 ]",
    "in this letter , we define and estimate a mean surface density of a dark halo within a radius of maximum circular velocity , @xmath25 and apply it to dark halos in various galaxies .",
    "this physical value reflects the central dark matter surface density , thus not strongly affected by the influence of external disturbances .",
    "we find that even though dark halo parameters in each galaxy sample are derived based on the assumption of different dark halo density profiles and determined by several independent methods , this surface density is universal across a wide luminosity range of galaxies , irrespective of dark matter distribution in each of the galaxies .",
    "furthermore , this constancy is found to be useful for constraining dark matter models , especially the particle mass of wdm , because @xmath25 is directly derivable from the theoretical predictions based on @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "our results show that at larger values of @xmath19 corresponding to high halo - mass scales , this constancy for real galaxies can be successfully reproduced in both cdm and wdm models , even though we do not perform any fitting to the data .",
    "however , @xmath25 derived from wdm largely deviates from the observational constancy at dwarf - galaxy mass scales , whilst that of cdm is in good agreement with it .",
    "this is because there is a prominent difference between mcr for cdm and wdm at low halo - mass scales . in order to be in agreement with this constancy",
    ", we have found that wdm particles need to be heavier than 3  kev .",
    "this letter proposes an astrophysical test on the nature of dark matter .",
    "the key dark halo mass range to distinguish dark matter models in this test is the lowest halo - mass scales , such as those of classical and ultra - faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "wide - field spectroscopic studies of these galaxies over large areas with the planned prime focus spectrograph to be mounted on the subaru telescope and high - precision spectroscopy for a plenty of much fainter stars with the thirty meter telescope will provide a better determination of dark halo properties of the mw and m31 dsphs , and thus allow us to increase our knowledge about the basic properties of dark matter .",
