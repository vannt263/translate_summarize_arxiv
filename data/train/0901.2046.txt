    "while each of these methods have their pros and cons , all of them have been used in the past ( and continue to be used ) by the community for studying quantitative morphologies of high redshift galaxies . in light of this fact , it becomes imperative to be aware of the biases that are expected , as one probes progressively bluer rest - frame wavelengths at higher redshifts using each of these techniques .",

    "this factor is a less severe ( but no less significant ) @xmath38 , if we employ a @xmath18 as the cutoff for identifying merger candidates .",
    "we checked whether the objects with @xmath39 in either of the two filters are systematically fainter than the whole sample , i.e. whether poorer snr might be responsible for these objects having anomalously low @xmath1 .",
    "we found that in the @xmath40 band , the median surface brightness for the subset of 57 objects with @xmath35 is @xmath41 ( compared to @xmath42 for the whole sample ) .",
    "this yields a snr of @xmath220 per pixel ( compared to @xmath221 for the whole sample ) .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath43 band , the median surface brightness for the subset of 28 objects with @xmath36 is @xmath44 ( compared to @xmath26 for the whole sample ) .",
    "this yields an snr of @xmath267 per pixel ( compared to @xmath273 per pixel for the whole sample ) .",
    "hence we see that the snr for the subset of objects with extremely low values of @xmath1 in both the filters is very similar to that for the entire sample indicating that the parameters derived for these objects are likely to be just as robust as for the entire sample .",
    "the fact that the differences in the derived value of @xmath1 in the two filters are dominated by galaxies with low values of @xmath3 that have a value of @xmath4 leads us to believe that we might probing clumpy star forming hii regions in these objects in the @xmath40 band .",
    "the tacit assumption that we are making here is that clumpy star formation in galaxies will lead to a lower @xmath1 value in the rest - frame uv but not in the rest - frame optical ( because star forming hii regions are blue ) .",
    "this would mean that objects with @xmath45 and @xmath4 are probably clumpy starforming galaxies which are intrinsically disky ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "while it is true that blue neighbours will tend to mimic hii regions in the rest - frame uv by producing a shallow srsic profile , however the very fact that they contribute little or no flux in the optical ( parametrized by a steeper @xmath4 ) means that they can not be massive systems ( as z band flux is a better tracer of stellar mass than uv flux ) and will constitute _ minor _ mergers at best ( see rawat et al . ( 2008 ) for further discussion on how flux in redder wavebands is better suited for identifying massive major merger candidates ) .",
    "so objects with @xmath45 and @xmath4 are likely to be either clumpy star forming galaxies or minor mergers , both of which are essentially contaminants , if one is interested in identifying major mergers . in section  [ individual_comments ] , we include comments on the morphology of individual objects with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( the working definition of @xmath4 ) in detail to show that our assertion above is indeed correct .        similarly , fig .",

    "this means that in the rest - frame uv , the number of high ellipticity ( @xmath7 ) objects is higher by a factor @xmath8 compared to the rest - frame optical .",
    "this might explain the reported claim in literature that high - z lbgs tend to show a significant skew towards higher ellipticities ( e.g. ravindranath et al .",

    "the f300w band light distribution is    fragmented , leading to a very low value of @xmath31 .",
    "* j033241.42 - 274044.8 * : :    this is a very diffuse galaxy , reminiscent of an irregular .",
    "this is a    marginal case with the @xmath31 only slightly lower than    the @xmath32 .    as can be seen from the individual description above and from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , most of the objects with @xmath45 and @xmath4 are probably clumpy starforming galaxies with an underlying disk ( @xmath34 ) of older stellar population .",
    "many objects are isolated and compact and the low value of @xmath31 can be attributed to diffuse / patchy light distribution in the f300w band rather than any merger activity . as mentioned earlier , while it is true that blue neighbours will tend to mimic hii regions in the rest - frame uv by producing a shallow srsic profile , however the very fact that they contribute little or no flux in the optical ( parametrized by a steeper @xmath4 ) means that they can not be massive systems ( as z band flux is a better tracer of stellar mass than uv flux ) and will constitute _ minor _ mergers at best . this analysis should go a long way in convincing the reader that using srsic profile fitting in the rest - frame uv is fraught with severe biases and should be used with caution .",
    "we have compared the rest - frame uv vs rest - frame optical morphologies of intermediate redshift ( @xmath0 ) uv bright galaxies , selected using the deep hst / wfpc2 u - band hudf parallels image in combination with the hst / acs f850lp goods dataset .",
    "the uv bright galaxies in this case are at lower redshifts and have lower luminosities than high-_z _ lbgs ( de mello et al .",
    "we performed single component srsic fits in both wfpc2/f300w and acs / f850lp bands for the 162 objects and find that :    \\1 ) in the rest - frame uv , the srsic index @xmath1 is lower in a large number of cases compared to the rest - frame optical .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that rest - frame uv light is sensitive to star - forming hii regions which are fragmented and patchy in nature leading to a light distribution which is shallower than the underlying galaxy light distribution seen in the rest - frame optical .",
    "this difference is mainly caused by galaxies with low values of @xmath3 that have a value of @xmath4 , and is not affected by galaxies with high values of @xmath1 , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ n_comparision](right ) .",
    "this has serious consequences as the srsic index @xmath1 is widely used for identifying the morphological class of a galaxy , with @xmath1 flatter than exponential being used for identifying merger candidates . in particular , we find that the use of rest - frame uv overestimates the number of merger candidates by @xmath240%-100% compared to the rest - frame optical , depending upon the cutoff in @xmath1 employed for identifying merger candidates .",
    "this shows that the so - called morphological k - correction is a serious consideration in constraining galaxy morphology at intermediate redshifts , as shown by conselice et al .",
    "@xcite . using @xmath18 as the criterion for identifying merger candidates",
    ", we recommend a correction factor of @xmath38 to the result of ravindranath et al .",
    "@xcite for calculating the fraction of lbgs at @xmath91 which are likely to be merger candidates .",
    "\\2 ) we also find that in the rest - frame uv , the number of high ellipticity ( @xmath7 ) objects is higher by a factor @xmath8 compared to the rest - frame optical .",
    "this might explain the reported results in literature that high-_z _ lbgs tend to show a skew towards higher ellipticities ( ravindranath et al .",
    "2006 ) , as most such work has been done using rest - frame uv datasets .",
    "we also note that the axis ratio @xmath5 is lower , i.e. ellipticity is higher in rest - frame uv compared to the rest - frame optical .",
    "the mean values of the axis ratio are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this indicates that the reported dominance of elongated morphologies among high-_z _ lbgs might just be a bias related to the use of rest - frame uv datasets .",
    "however , we can not conclusively exclude the possibility that lbgs might still have intrinsically different or elongated morphologies .",
    "our results are in agreement with the work of papovich et al .",
    "@xcite , who found that @xmath92 galaxies show strong transformation between their rest - frame uv and optical morphologies , using nicmos observations of hdf - n .",
    "it has been reported ( papovich et al . 2005 , conselice et al . 2005 ) that at redshifts @xmath93 , the morphology of a galaxy remains essentially unchanged from rest - frame uv to rest - frame optical .",
    "however , one should not neglect the effect produced by the @xmath94 surface brightness dimming , which at higher redshifts suppresses the ( relatively low surface brightness ) underlying galaxian light ( by @xmath95 magnitudes at @xmath96 ) , so that the only parts of a galaxy that are left visible even in the rest - frame optical are the high surface brightness hii regions ( while the underlying galaxy remains unconstrained ) . future medium depth survey like goods ( depth @xmath210 orbits ) using the near - ir channel of the upcoming camera , wfc3 on hst might _ fail _ to probe the underlying rest - frame optical galaxian light at @xmath96 simply due to @xmath94 surface brightness dimming effects .",
    "ultra - deep images ( depth @xmath2150 orbits ) with the near - ir channel of wfc3 will be required to constrain the underlying galaxian light at @xmath96 and will allow similar analysis of the morphology of galaxies to high-_z_.    a.r .",
