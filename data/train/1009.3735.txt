    "when in a multi - phase system initially in a mixed state the temperature is decreased to values corresponding to a coexisting region of the phase diagram , domains of ordered phases start to form and grow with time .",
    "the process is called phase separation and is relevant for a large variety of systems @xcite . in most of the cases",
    "studied theoretically , the temperature or other control parameters are assumed not depending on time and space , but are instantaneously set to their final values for coexistence .",
    "this assumption , reasonable in many situations , typically gives rise to a self - similar growth behavior with a characteristic domain size following a time power - law @xcite .",
    "however , there are cases where the dynamics of the control parameter needs to be considered @xcite since it can greatly affect the morphology of domains . in binary alloys , for example",
    ", slow cooling is used to produce optimal sequences of alternate bands of different materials @xcite . in polymeric mixtures the possibility of controlling the demixing morphology by appropriate thermal driving has been studied in refs .  @xcite ; modulated patterns have been observed when a mixture is periodically brought above and below the critical point @xcite .",
    "other worth examples of complex pattern formation due to the dynamics of the control parameters occur in crystal growth @xcite , immersion - precipitation membranes @xcite , or in electrolyte diffusion in gels @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study binary fluids quenched by contact with cold walls at temperatures below the critical value .",
    "the behavior of binary fluids in sudden quenches at homogeneous temperature is quite known @xcite . for symmetric composition , the typical interconnected pattern of spinodal decomposition is observed . in the system here",
    "considered , phase separation is expected to start close to the walls and develop in the inner of the system following the temperature evolution .",
    "the dynamics of this process and the role of the velocity field have not been explored too much , in spite of their relevance for many of the systems mentioned above .",
    "two - dimensional studies of diffusive binary systems with cold sharp fronts propagating at constant speed have shown the formation of structures aligned on a direction depending on the speed @xcite .",
    "these results are also supported by theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "lamellar - like structures have been also found in numerical studies of two - dimensional off - symmetrical binary systems with the temperature following a fixed diffusive law @xcite . in a model with the temperature",
    "dynamically coupled to the concentration field , point - like cold sources have been shown to give rise to ring structures of alternate phases @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , more usual morphologies have been found in cases with fixed thermal gradient @xcite , while complex phenomena such as sequential phase - separation cascades have been observed when the control parameter is slowly homogeneously changed @xcite .",
    "the effects of full coupling between all thermo - hydrodynamic variables have been not considered sofar .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the theoretical model and the numerical method",
    "are illustrated .",
    "the dynamics of our system is described by mass , momentum , and energy equations with thermodynamics based on a free - energy functional including gradient terms . in section iii the results of our simulations are shown .",
    "we will explore the control parameter space by varying the viscosity and the thermal diffusivity .",
    "this will allow to analyze the differences with respect to the behavior of binary fluids in instantaneous quenching .",
    "the presentation will be focused on few cases typical for each regime .",
    "a final discussion will follow in section iv .",
    "we consider a binary mixture with dynamical variables @xmath0*v*@xmath1 which are , respectively , the temperature , the velocity , the total density , and the order parameter field being the concentration difference .",

    "( 1 ) is a combination of an internal energy gradient contribution proportional to @xmath5 and of an entropic term proportional to @xmath6 @xcite , hence @xmath7 .",
    "the system has a critical transition at @xmath8 and the order parameter in the separated phases takes the values @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamical equations are given by @xcite @xmath10 -0.4 cm @xmath11 -0.4",

    "finally , in order to completely set up the dynamical system , phenomenological expressions for the currents are needed . as usually , one takes @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the positively defined matrix of kinetic coefficients with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the mobility and thermal diffusivity , respectively , assumed constant @xcite .    in order to solve eqs .",
    "( [ mass]-[ener ] ) in @xmath32 we have developed a hybrid lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) @xcite where lbm @xcite is used to simulate the continuity and navier - stokes equations ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ momentum ] ) while finite - difference methods are implemented to solve the convection - diffusion and the energy equations ( [ massdiff ] ) and ( [ ener ] ) .",
    "lbm has been widely used to study multi - phase / component fluids @xcite and , in particular , hydrodynamic effects in phase ordering @xcite .",
    "it is defined in terms of a set of distribution functions , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , located in each site @xmath35 at each time @xmath36 of a d2q9 ( 2 space dimensions and 9 lattice velocities ) lattice where sites are connected to first and second neighbors by lattice velocity vectors of modulus @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , respectively .",

    "no - slip boundary conditions are adopted for the lbm @xcite , the temperature is set to fixed values @xmath60 at the bottom wall and @xmath61 at the up wall , respectively , and neutral wetting for the concentration is adopted .",
    "this latter condition corresponds to impose @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an inward normal unit vector to the walls .",
    "these conditions together ensure @xmath65 so that the concentration gradient is parallel to the walls and there is no flux across the walls .",

    "in the following we will explore the parameter space keeping fixed the values of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we will use lattices of size ranging from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "we have considered different values of @xmath70 and @xmath31 . before focusing on the cases representative of the various regimes",

    "it is therefore more convenient for our purposes to introduce the schmidt and prandtl numbers @xmath80 and @xmath81 defined as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the coefficient of the linear term in the chemical potential @xmath21 @xcite . here",

    "@xmath89 is always much smaller than @xmath90 ( see in the following ) , and the fluid results practically incompressible , as checked , with @xmath91 .",
    "for this reason we do not present in the paper any result about the time evolution of the total density @xmath92 .",
    "first , as a benchmark for our method , we consider the relaxation of a single interface profile with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a low viscosity regime as discussed in the following .",
    "we started the simulation with a sharp concentration step with values @xmath96 and @xmath97 and bulk temperature @xmath98 keeping fixed the temperatures @xmath99 at the bottom and up walls ( fig .  1 ( a ) ) .",
    "the system reaches a stationary state with constant temperature gradient and concentration profile as in fig .  1 ( b )",
    ". the numerical values of concentrations in the two bulk phases are in very good agreement with the analytical expression for @xmath100 corresponding to the equilibrium values of @xmath101 shown in the related inset .",
    "this means that the concentration field @xmath102 is in local equilibrium .",
    "the temperature of the up wall is then set to the same value of the temperature of the bottom wall ( fig .  1 ( c ) ) .",
    "then , as it can be seen in fig .  1 ( d ) , the system equilibrates at constant temperature with the expected concentration profile .",
    "spurious velocities are of order @xmath103 and result completely negligible .",
    "the test shows that stationary states are well reproduced by our algorithm .",
    "we describe our results for phase separation .",
    "we first consider a case at very high viscosity with @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) and symmetric composition ( runs 1 - 8 ) . here",
    "the effects of the velocity field are negligible .",
    "we set @xmath106 and initial bulk temperature above @xmath107 . as it can be seen in fig .  2 , for thermal diffusivities @xmath108 , usual isotropic phase separation",
    "is observed . in the range @xmath109 , in spite of the neutral wetting condition on the boundaries , domains in the bulk have interfaces preferentially parallel to thermal fronts . for",
    "smaller values of @xmath31 domains grow perpendicularly to the walls .",
    "these results agree with those of refs .",
    "@xcite in purely diffusive models where the same morphological sequence was found by decreasing the speed of cold fronts moving into a region with the mixed phase",
    ". however , also in absence of hydrodynamic effects , our case is different since the thermodynamics of the mixture is fully consistently treated and temperature fronts have no sharp imposed profile .",
    "we will now concentrate on cases at intermediate thermal diffusivities where domains are parallel to the walls and propagation fronts can be traced .",
    "concentration and temperature configurations at successive times for @xmath93 ( run 4a ) are shown in fig .  3 and fig .  4 , respectively .",
    "in this case it is @xmath110 .",
    "the temperature fronts have typical diffusive profiles which slowly relax to the equilibrium value imposed on the boundaries . in order to be quantitative",
    ", we defined @xmath111 as the distance from the wall where the temperature assumes a fixed value ( we chose @xmath112 ) and measured this quantity in simulations with large rectangular lattices .",
    "the solution of the diffusion equation with initial temperature @xmath113 and fixed boundary value @xmath114 is @xmath115}$ ] which implies @xmath116 . in the inset of fig .  5 it is shown , in simulations with different @xmath31 , that @xmath117 follows the standard diffusion behavior .",
    "the time behavior of @xmath117 has been checked not depending on the specific value of the ratio @xmath118 in the range @xmath119 $ ] ; by considering a value of @xmath86 such that @xmath120 allows to track the position of the temperature front for a longer time interval .",
    "one can also consider the behavior of the fronts limiting the regions with separated phases , clearly observable in the first three snapshots of fig .",
    "their position can be defined as the distance @xmath121 from the walls beyond which the condition @xmath122 is verified everywhere .",
    "more precisely , we took @xmath121 as the point beyond which @xmath123 with @xmath124 ; the value of @xmath125 is chosen to match the maximum value of the fluctuations of @xmath126 in the initial disordered state , where @xmath127 .",
    "( in the last snapshot of fig .",
    "3 the two fronts propagating from up and down have come close each other and more usual phase separation occurs in the central region of the system . )",
    "we measured @xmath121 on rectangular lattices for different @xmath31 and observed deviations from diffusive behavior ( see fig .",
    "we found that @xmath121 grows by power law with an exponent depending on @xmath31 .",
    "our fits give @xmath128 for @xmath93 and exponents closer to @xmath129 for smaller @xmath31 .",
    "we analyzed for different @xmath31 possible variations of the typical values of fluid velocity but we did not find any .",
    "therefore the change of the exponent of @xmath121 can not be attributed to the velocity field .",
    "even if @xmath121 moves faster than @xmath117 and at long times it results @xmath130 , we checked that the relation @xmath131 is always verified so that phase separation always occurs for @xmath132 .",
    "since the phase separation is induced by the temperature change , one could have expected a similar behavior for @xmath121 and @xmath117 .",
    "the discrepancy could be related to the broad character of the temperature fronts which spreads the phase separated region .",
    "we also observed that the width of lamellar domains decreases at larger @xmath31 , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .      at lower viscosities",
    "the evolution of morphology is very different in the range with intermediate values of thermal diffusivity .",
    "we will in particular illustrate in fig .",
    "6 the case with @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath93 ( runs 19 ) , for which we found @xmath133 .",
    "this is the same thermal diffusivity of fig .",
    "3 . at this viscosity hydrodynamics",
    "is relevant .",
    "indeed , in instantaneous quenching at constant temperature and @xmath94 we observed the domain growth exponent to assume the inertial value @xmath134 ( at odd with the diffusive high - viscosity value @xmath135 ) @xcite .",
    "the growth exponent was calculated by measuring the characteristic length defined by the inverse of the first momentum of the structure factor @xcite .",
    "the main effect due to hydrodynamics observable in fig .",
    "6 is that domains do not grow aligned with temperature fronts as it occurs for the same thermal diffusivity at high viscosity .",
    "circular patterns are stabilized by the flow @xcite and an example is given in fig .",
    "a similar picture occurs for other values of @xmath31 here not reported ( see table i ) . on the other hand , the other thermal diffusivity regimes are less affected by hydrodynamics .",
    "when decreasing @xmath31 , it is still possible to observe domains growing with interfaces normal to the walls as in the case at high viscosity ( see fig .  8 - run 21b ) , while at larger @xmath31 ( run 18 ) phase separation occurs isotropically like in an instantaneous quenching .",
    "the cases shown in figs .",
    "3 and 6 are typical of the high and low viscosity regimes . at intermediate values of @xmath70 one can observe features common to the two above cases ( see fig .  9 for @xmath136 - run 11a ) .",
    "concerning the behavior of @xmath111 , we could not find relevant differences by varying @xmath70 with respect to the case at high viscosity .",
    "another effect induced by hydrodynamics is the formation of structures in the inner part of the system at earlier times than in the case at high viscosity ( compare fig .  3 and fig .",
    "6 ) . in the inner region",
    "we can observe the typical interconnected pattern of spinodal decomposition but with a characteristic length - scale different from that of domains close to the walls .",
    "however , while the structures close to the walls are in local equilibrium , that is @xmath137 , in the middle of the system the concentration field is such that @xmath138 .",
    "a temporal regime characterized by the presence of domains with two scales was found in systems of different size ( from @xmath68 to @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 . in order to characterize the two scales we analyzed the behavior of the structure factor . in fig .",
    "10 the spherically averaged structure factor is shown at two consecutive times for a system having the same parameters of fig .  6 and size @xmath141 .",
    "two peaks are observable at each time that can be interpreted as related to the existence of two different length scales with one about twice longer than the other .",
    "the higher peak at smaller wave vector corresponds to the larger domains close to the walls while the other peak is related to the thinner domains in the inner of the system . at increasing times ,",
    "the two peaks tend to merge . due to this morphological evolution , in simulations at low viscosity ,",
    "the position of the phase separation front @xmath121 could be measured only for a short time interval making not possible to determine the power - law behavior .",
    "finally , we show results for systems with asymmetric composition . in fig .  11 the evolution of two systems only differing for the value of viscosity is shown .",
    "lamellar patterns prevail at high viscosity while circular droplets dominate at low viscosity ( @xmath94 ) . in the latter case , again , two typical scales can be observed with thin tubes of materials connecting larger domains .",
    "the behavior of @xmath117 is similar to that of the symmetric case .",
    "we have developed a numerical method for thermal binary fluids described by continuity , navier - stokes , convection - diffusion , and energy equations .",
    "we have studied quenching by contact with external walls , and we have shown how the pattern formation depends on thermal diffusivity , viscosity , and composition of the system .",
    "the evolution is very different from that observed in instantaneous homogeneous quenching . at high viscosity , different orientations of domains",
    "are possible . in an intermediate range of thermal diffusivities domains",
    "are parallel to the walls .",
    "the fronts limiting the regions with separated domains move towards the inner of the system with a power law behavior not always corresponding to that of the temperature fronts . at low viscosity",
    ", the velocity field favors more circular patterns , and domains are characterized by different length - scales close to the walls and in the inner of the system .",
    "off - symmetrical mixtures give more ordered patterns .",
    "we conclude with two remarks on possible future directions of work .",
    "the first one concerns the soret effect , which corresponds to have a mass diffusion current induced by thermal gradients .",
    "this effect can become relevant in quenching very close to the critical point where the ratio @xmath142 becomes large @xcite . here",
    "@xmath143 is the thermal ( mass ) diffusion coefficient ( @xmath144 in our notation ) and @xmath76 is the mass diffusion coefficient defined at the beginning of section iii . in order to have a first idea on how the soret effect can affect the pattern morphology",
    ", we considered a case with @xmath145 corresponding to the highest values for this ratio reported in literature @xcite .",
    "this would give @xmath146 , taking for @xmath76 the value used in the runs of section iii .",
    "we run simulations for this case .",
    "we observed , in the intermediate range of thermal diffusivity and at high viscosity , the tendency of the system to exhibit more ordered lamellar patterns ( parallel to the walls ) . at higher thermal diffusivity isotropic phase separation",
    "is found as usually , while at very low thermal diffusivity ( @xmath147 ) , parallel patterns are found instead of perpendicular patterns . at low viscosity ( we tested the case corresponding to that of fig .  6 ) hydrodynamics continues to favor domains with more circular shape .",
    "we run also simulations with @xmath148 , corresponding to a ratio @xmath149 , without finding relevant differences with the respect to the case with @xmath150 .",
    "we also observe that the behavior of @xmath121 could depend on our choice for @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis of the soret effect will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , the morphology could be still richer in three dimensions , also due to the existence of more hydrodynamic regimes @xcite , so that three - dimensional simulations would complete the picture given sofar .",
