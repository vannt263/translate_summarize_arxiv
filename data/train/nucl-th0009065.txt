    "is there a qualitative and possibly quantitative explanation for the isospin amplification effects seen for light isotopes ?",
    "furthermore , do these effects carry over into the production of heavier or exotic isotopes ? it has been experimentally observed that the ratio of mirror nuclei , e.g. @xmath0o/@xmath0n or t/@xmath1he , can be of order 10 even though the neutron - to - proton ratio of the colliding nuclei is approximately 1.2 @xcite .",

    "additionally , isospin effects have been studied in lattice - gas models @xcite and in percolation @xcite . since our goal is to study the yields of rarely produced isotopes which may be produced in future radioactive beam facilities as rarely as in one per @xmath6 events",
    ", we employ the methods recently promoted by chase and mekjian@xcite which forego the need of using monte carlo methods .",
    "majumder and das gupta have in fact studied boron , carbon and nitrogen isotope production with a similar model to what is presented here @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that explicit interaction of fragments ( beyond mean field or excluded volume effects ) is outside the scope of the formalism .",
    "furthermore , we choose to focus on the canonical ensemble rather than the microcanonical ensemble which would strictly constrain the energy of the sampled configurations .",
    "the canonical distribution considers all configurations of the same net @xmath4 and net @xmath5 , weighted by the boltzmann factor , @xmath7 .",
    "the mean energy and variance of the energies are given by derivatives of the canonical distribution , @xmath8 it has been shown that these systems undergo first - order phase transitions , which implies an infinite specific heat for infinite systems . however , for systems of size @xmath9 the energy rises by approximately 4 mev per nucleon as the temperature changes by one mev in the range of @xmath10 mev .",
    "this results in a variance of the energy per nucleon , @xmath11 thus canonical calculations effectively sample configurations within an excitation energy window of approximately 1.0 mev per nucleon , or less if the systems are much larger than @xmath12 , or if the temperature is away from the transition region .",
    "unless an experiment gates on excitation energies to an accuracy better than 1.0 mev per nucleon , there is little motivation to pursue a microcanonical treatment .",

    "given our lack of understanding of the ground state energies , let alone the excited state energies , we employ a liquid - drop treatment .",
    "we have chosen the finite - range liquid - drop model ( frldm ) @xcite as a means for generating ground state energies and have ignored the microscopic terms in the model which account for shell structure .",
    "the spectrum of excited states was generated by assuming a uniformly spaced assortment of single - particle states with spacing @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the level density parameter , chosen to be 10 mev .",
    "the degeneracy of a state with excitation energy @xmath27 was found by counting all ways to arrange particles and holes such that they summed to the desired excitation energy . for heavy nuclei ,",
    "the separation @xmath28 becomes small , and when the separation fell below one mev , the spectrum is interpolated onto a mesh of 1.0 mev resolution .",

    "the weights were also simultaneously added into the ground states of the eight nuclei representing the eight decay modes .",
    "thus , the decaying process exactly preserved the initial @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the original system .",
    "given that heavier nuclei might have up to a thousand levels to decay with each level decaying into any of several hundreds of levels in a daughter nucleus , and given the existence of thousands of isotopes , the calculation of sequential decays often required a few hours .",
    "fragmentation is clearly sensitive to temperature , not only in the mass yields but also in the isotopic yields .",
    "higher temperatures allow the system to produce nuclei with unfavorable symmetry energies more efficiently .",
    "however , higher temperatures also result in hotter nuclei that experience longer decay chains which in turn push the resultant residues closer to the valley of stability .",

    "the distribution described in eq .",
    "( [ liquiddrop_eq ] ) can be described by an offset and a gaussian width .",
    "the offset is largely determined by the neutron fraction @xmath66 of the composite system and does not depend strongly on the temperature unless the temperature becomes so high that protons , neutrons , tritons and @xmath1he fragments can absorb much of any initial excess of the neutron number .",

    "use of the grand canonical ensemble is invalid for smaller systems , and even in the case of large systems , can result in overpredicting yields by an order of magnitude near the neutron drip lines .",
    "by fragmenting heavier systems , one is able to create hot systems with higher neutron fractions . by choosing larger systems ,",
    "yields are less affected by the constraints of exactly conserving the net number of neutrons and protons .",
    "although the qualitative trend is clear  larger and more neutron - rich systems are better suited to producing extremely neutron - rich fragments  quantitative dependencies might be rather surprising given the amplifications mentioned earlier .",

    "[ systemdependence_fig ] for three systems : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",

    "the importance of choosing the most neutron - rich isotope is clearly apparent in the comparison of the @xmath50 and the @xmath80 systems . here ,",
    "the neutron fraction changes from 0.6 to 0.575 .",
    "furthermore , comparison with the smaller system at the same neutron fraction @xmath81 demonstrates the modest enhancement of neutron - rich fragments involved in using larger systems .",
    "given the sensitivity of the yields to changing the neutron and proton number of the fragmenting system , evaporation of neutrons during the early stages of the reaction should significantly reduce the production of rare neutron - rich isotopes . during the first 100 fm / c , weisskopf arguments suggest that 20 to 30 neutrons , but only 5 to 10 protons , might evaporate from a uranium nucleus heated to a temperature of 10 mev . the neutron fraction of the residue might thus change from 0.614 to @xmath820.59 during the evaporation which significantly reduces the possibility to emit fragments near the neutron drip line .",
    "fission yields are also affected by the number of evaporated pre - fission neutrons , which can be sizable , especially when the fission time scale is large .",
    "if one wishes to find reactions with the highest abundances of rare neutron - rich fragments , one should try to minimize the number of neutrons emitted in the pre - fragmentation stage of the collision . reducing the number of neutrons emitted during the pre - fragmentation stage",
    "might be accomplished by choosing heavy - ion collisions as a means of producing multifragmented systems . since heavy ion collisions , especially mid - central collisions ,",
    "retain some of the initial collective longitudinal motion of the beam , the expansion does not require as much time to accelerate from rest as it would in a @xmath83 collision .",
    "furthermore , by colliding two very heavy nuclei , the global system would be relatively proton rich and not emit neutrons as preferentially , relative to protons , during the early stages of the collision .",
    "in fact , the mid - rapidity region , often referred to as the neck , might be even more neutron rich than the target or projectile @xcite .",
    "of course , the disadvantage to using heavy - ion collisions is that lower beam energies are used and the produced fragments are not as forward focused which might make them more difficult to detect .",
    "if one wishes to produce fragments with charges greater than calcium , @xmath84 , and energies less than 30@xmath54 mev , electron recombination and the resulting impure charge states makes detection and refocusing especially difficult .",
    "although the calculated yields of rare fragments depend on details of the modeling procedure , it is not obvious to what degree yields are sensitive to particular aspects of the modeling .",
    "one obvious parameter is the symmetry energy parameter .",
    "as the symmetry energy is uncertain by one or two mev outside the region of measured nuclei the associated boltzmann factors might change by a factor of two .",

    "particle - number constraints were seen to be non - negligible , especially for the fragmentation of smaller systems . assuming a simple liquid - drop form for the ground - state energies and assuming a simplified form for the distribution and degeneracies of excited states , initial yields were calculated for every level of every possible isotope .",
    "sequential evaporation has been modeled by calculating the ways to partition the initial weight of every particle - unstable level into any state to which it might decay .",
    "eight modes of decay were considered .",
    "since neither the calculation of the initial distribution nor the modeling of the sequential decay involved monte carlo procedures , it was possible to calculate yields for extremely rare isotopes .    by considering yields of fragments of a fixed @xmath54 as a function of @xmath69 ,",
    "two lessons were learned by considering a simple liquid drop model .",
    "first , the width of the initial distribution was determined largely by the ratio of the temperature to the symmetry term in the liquid - drop model .",
    "secondly , isospin amplification , or isospin fractionation , could also be simply understood in terms of the same two quantities .",
    "sequential decay dramatically altered the yields , pushing the yields towards the valley of stability .",
    "the effects were strongest for larger fragments and for higher temperatures . as the initial distributions for fragments of fixed @xmath54 as a function of @xmath69 were broadest at high temperature , inclusion of sequential decay shows that 5 mev is the best temperature for creating rare neutron - rich fragments in the @xmath70 region . for heavy fragments with @xmath72 , the optimum temperature was near three mev which is more in the domain of fission than the domain of multifragmentation .",
    "in order to understand the sensitivity of the calculations to various aspects of the modeling , the breakup density , level density , system size and system neutron fraction were systematically varied .",
    "results were weakly dependent on the breakup density and moderately sensitive to the level density .",
    "larger systems lead to somewhat broader yields due to finite - size constraints .",
    "yields were especially sensitive to small changes in the isospin composition of the overall system .",
    "thus , choosing projectiles and targets with large neutron fractions , e.g.  @xmath66 for uranium is 0.614 and @xmath66 for @xmath2sn is 0.597 , strongly increases the chances of creating isotopes near the neutron drip line .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the yields with respect to details of the evaporation was considered by adjusting the coulomb barrier that leads to preferential emission of neutrons as opposed to protons .",
    "the yields of neutron - rich fragments were surprisingly insensitive to the barrier and changed almost imperceptibly when the coulomb barrier was removed altogether .",
    "proton - rich fragments were however quite sensitive to the details , as the tunneling allowed proton - rich fragments to return to the valley of stability .",
    "the ability of statistical models to explain isotope production is certainly of scientific interest in its own right .",
    "additionally , one might also consider whether multifragmentation could offer a competitive means for creating rare isotopes .",
    "however , separating and focusing particles could be problematic .",
    "if one fragmented heavy nuclei , which have the broadest yields , the coulomb forces between the fragment of interest and various parts of the residual system would spread the emission over a large kinematic region making separation or focusing of the produced particles difficult",
    ". this would be especially true for fragments produced at mid - rapidity .",
    "thus , it is difficult to discern whether there is a pragmatic side to the isospin degree of freedom in multifragmentation . to date",
    ", experiments that measure isotope yields have either been designed to focus on projectile rapidities and thus ignore multifragmentative events , or have measured production of light elements , @xmath99 .",
    "if statistical descriptions are shown to accurately describe isotope production for a broader range of nuclides , it might warrant serious consideration of designing an apparatus to capture and identify very rare isotopes in a very different environment than projectile fragmentation .",
