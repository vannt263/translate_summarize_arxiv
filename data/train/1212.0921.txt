    "multicomponent systems are of fundamental importance in many fields of physics on account of their universality and complexity . in particular ,",
    "great attention has been recently paid to a mixture of two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in cold atom physics due to ultra high purity , excellent theoretical description , experimental accessibility and precise controllability of a condensate system @xcite .",
    "two - component becs can consist of two different alkalis , or different isotopes , or different hyperfine states of the same alkali atom .",
    "such a mixture provides an attractive and versatile testing ground to study the intriguing properties of macroscopic quantum many - body systems inaccessible in single - component becs .",
    "in fact , many interesting phenomena have been predicted theoretically and some observed experimentally in two - species becs , ranging from the topological structures of the ground and excited states ho , pu , trippenbach , adhikari1,riboli , navarro , catelani , gligoric , lwen , kuopanportti , papp , mccarron , symmetry - breaking transition @xcite , quantum turbulence takeuchi1 , pattern formation @xcite , vortex - bright - solitons law and skyrmions @xcite , entangled states @xcite , to the stripe phase induced by spin - orbit coupling @xcite , etc . among these phenomena , of crucial significance is the phase structure of the system ho , pu , trippenbach , adhikari1,riboli , navarro , catelani , gligoric , lwen , kuopanportti , papp , mccarron .",
    "for instance , a separated phase of a two - component bec is the premise of studying the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite and rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "most of theoretical literatures use the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation ( a semi - analytical method ) or a variational approach to study the ground state properties of two - component becs , where spherically symmetric mixed phases , spherically symmetric separated phases , and asymmetric side - by - side separated phases are predicted . for the former case ,",
    "the kinetic energy is completely neglected . however ,",
    "when the contribution of kinetic energy to the total energy is considerable , the tf approximation will fail @xcite and thus can not be relied upon to determine the phase structure of a two - component bec . the effect of kinetic energy on the phase transition of a two - component bec in an infinitely deep square well potential has been recently demonstrated in ref . @xcite . as for the variational approach ,",
    "it is usually limited to few simple quantum states and certain external potentials . in this context , it is necessary to resort to numerical methods for obtaining reliable phase structures .    in this paper , we investigate the exact two - dimensional ( 2d ) phase structures of two - component becs with respective vortex - antivortex superposition states ( vavss ) .",
    "the vavss in becs is a quite interesting research object as it can exhibit rich physical properties kapale , liu , simula , thanvanthri , wen1 , such as peculiar petal - like structure @xcite and unique dynamics @xcite .",
    "particularly , the equilibrium properties of a quasi-2d degenerate boson ",
    "fermion mixture ( dbfm ) with a bosonic vavss is recently studied by using a quantum - hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the vavss greatly influences the equilibrium state and stability of a dbfm , where a special intermittency phenomenon  exists in the two stability curves of the dbfm with a bosonic vavss @xcite and the one with a bosonic vortex adhikari2 .",
    "on the other hand , the vavss may have many potential applications in quantum information , quantum communication , and inertial sensing @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the creation of vavss in becs has been reported by different groups andersen , wright1,wright2,scherer .",
    "an interesting question is to ask how the phase structure of a two - component bec is modified by the respective vavss combining with intra- and interspecies interactions .",
    "we show that , depending on the relative interaction strengths and the winding numbers of vortex and antivortex , the two - component becs with respective vavss can display rich phase structures not met in other systems , such as fully separated phases , inlaid separated phases , and asymmetric separated phase with ( deformed ) petal - like component density profiles .",
    "we give a phase diagram for the case of equal unit winding numbers of vortex and antivortex in respective components .",
    "the typical phase structures are long - lived according to our nonlinear stability analysis . for the case of unequal winding numbers of vortex and antivortex , each component in any of the possible phases",
    "is in a vortex - antivortex cluster state , where the phase defects emerge in the form of visible vortex , or hidden vortex , or ghost vortex .",
    "furthermore , we reveal and discuss the general relation between the vortex - antivortex cluster state and the winding numbers of vortex and antivortex .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "a conventional criterion for phase separation is given by @xmath64 , which is based on the minimization of the total interaction energy @xcite .",
    "note that in the derivation of this criterion the becs are supposed to be homogeneous and the kinetic energy is neglected .",
    "however , the criterion will fail when the kinetic energy becomes important in a nonuniform system .",
    "in fact , the kinetic energy play a vital role in determining the configuration of two - component becs with vavss . according to the condition @xmath65 , for instance , our system would be in a separated phase if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , but only @xmath68 can the actual phase separation occur when @xmath66 .",
    "the similar effect arises for any fixed value of @xmath56 or @xmath57 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . physically , the kinetic energy acts against the interspecies interaction .",
    "the latter is responsible for phase demixing while the former tends to expand the becs and thus favors phase mixing . at the same time",
    ", the trapping potential tends to trap the condensates and hence also sustains phase mixing .",
    "therefore , phase separation can be suppressed by the kinetic energy and external potential in some situations even if the condition @xmath64 is satisfied , as we saw in figs",
    "recently , the influence of kinetic energy on the mixing - demixing transition by changing the confinement was discussed in ref .",
    "the authors introduce a parameter @xmath69 to characterize the overlap between two condensate wave functions .",
    "and then the system shows phase separation if @xmath70 .",
    "however , neither the criterion @xmath64 nor the condition @xmath71 can distinguish different separated phases as shown in fig",
    ". 2 and fig . 3(b ) .",
    "in addition , from eqs .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) , ( [ gpe2 ] ) , ( polartimeind1 ) and ( [ polartimeind2 ] ) , we can see that the two components of the system satisfy the exchange symmetry , which indicates that the phase diagram will be the same if one exchanges the two component wave functions .",
    "for fixed values of @xmath72 and @xmath14 , nevertheless , two different values of @xmath73 which are symmetric concerning the line of @xmath59 will lead to two different quantum states .",
    "the corresponding symmetric one of the interaction set @xmath74 is @xmath75 [ @xmath72 swaps @xmath73 , and the set @xmath75 is not in the same phase diagram ] rather than the set @xmath76 being symmetric about the line of @xmath77 .",

    "1 is asymmetric with respect to the line of @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath55 is a typical parameter value in current experiments .",

    "it is deserved to mention that similar phase structures also exist in two - component becs with vavss with higher winding numbers @xmath91 .",
    "in that case , the stability of phase structures become lower because of the higher energy resulted from the higher winding numbers .",

    "in particular , an interesting vortex - antivortex cluster state occurs in each component in any of the possible phase structures , where the vortices and antivortices appear in the form of visible vortex , or hidden vortex , or ghost vortex .",
    "furthermore , a general relation between the vortex - antivortex cluster states and the winding numbers of vortex and antivortex is revealed and analyzed .",
    "finally , we show that the azimuthon proposed recently in nonlinear optics and in becs is a special example of vavss in terms of their solution expressions .    l.w .",

    "<S> we investigate the phase structure of two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with repulsive intra- and interspecies interactions in the presence of respective vortex - antivortex superposition states ( vavss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that different winding numbers of vortex and antivortex and different intra- and interspecies interaction strengths may lead to different phase configurations , such as fully separated phases , inlaid separated phases , asymmetric separated phase , and partially mixed phases , where the density profile of each component displays a petal - like ( or modulated petal - like ) structure . a phase diagram is given for the case of equal unit winding numbers of the vortex and antivortex in respective components , and it is shown that conventional criterion for phase separation of two - component becs is not applicable for the present system due to the vavss . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our nonlinear stability analysis indicates that the typical phase structures of two - component becs with vavss allow to be detected in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the case of unequal winding numbers of the vortex and antivortex in respective components , we find that each component in any of the possible phase structures is in a cluster state of vortices and antivortices , where the topological defects appear in the form of singly quantized visible vortex , or hidden vortex , or ghost vortex , depending on the specific parameters of the system . finally , a general rule between the vortex - antivortex cluster state and the winding numbers of vortex and antivortex is revealed . </S>"
