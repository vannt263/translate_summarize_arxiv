    "the modeling activity of language dynamics aims at describing language evolution as the global effect of the local interactions between individuals in a population of @xmath0 agents , who tend to align their verbal behavior locally , by a negotiation process through which a successful communication is achieved @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the emergence of a particular communication system is not due to an external coordination , or a common psychological background , but it simply occurs as a convergence effect in the dynamical processes that start from an initial condition with no existing words ( agents having to invent them ) , or with no agreement .    our work is based on the naming game ( ng ) model , and on its assumptions  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ int - base ] we recall the ng basic pairwise interaction scheme .",
    "a fundamental assumption of ng is that vocabulary evolution associated to every single object is considered independent .",
    "this lets us simplify the evolution of the whole lexicon as the evolution of the set of words associated to a single object , equally perceived in the sensorial sphere by all agents .",
    "the simplicity of ng in describing the emergence of a lexicon also relies on the fact that competing words in an individual vocabulary are not weighted , so that they can be easily stored or deleted  @xcite .",
    "in fact it turns out that for convergence to a single word consensus state , the weights are not necessary as it was supposed by the seminal work in this research field  @xcite .",
    "every agent is a box that could potentially contain an infinite number of words , so the number of states that can define the agent is limited only by the number of words diffused in the population at the beginning of the process ( so that anyone can speak with at least one word ) .    in this work",
    "we aimed not only at the aspect of competition of a language form with other ones , but also at introducing interactions between them , with the possibility of producing new ones .",
    "we investigate conditions for the success of a new idiom , as product of a synthesis and competition of preexisting idioms . to this purpose",
    ", we introduce a stochastic interaction scheme in the basic naming game accounting for this synthesis , and show in a very simple case that the success of the new spoken form at expense of the old ones depends both on the stochastic parameters and the fractions of the different idioms spoken by populations at the beginning of the process .",
    "we have simulated this process starting from an initial condition where a fraction @xmath1 of the population speaks with @xmath2 and the remaining @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that when the different - speaking fractions are roughly of the same size the new form , which we call @xmath5 ( therefore we shall refer to our model as the `` abc model '' in the following ) , created from the synthesis of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , establishes and supplants the other two forms . instead , when @xmath6 ( or symmetrically @xmath7 ) , above a threshold depending on the chosen stochastic parameters , the term @xmath2 establishes ( or symmetrically @xmath4 ) , namely one of the starting idioms prevails and settles in the population .",
    "previous attempts to model the emergence of a creole language , i.e.  an idiom originating by a sort of hybridization and fusion of languages , can be found in literature @xcite .",
    "the model we propose here is based on a mean field topology involving @xmath0 agents , i.e.  any two agents picked up randomly can interact . despite this pretty simple topology of interactions ,",
    "the proposed model will show a richness of behaviors . in the basic naming game ,",
    "the initial condition is fixed with an empty word list for each agent  @xcite .",
    "if an agent chosen as speaker still owns an empty list , he invents a new word and utters it . in our proposed new model",
    "all agents are initially assigned a given word , either @xmath2 or @xmath4 , so that there is no possibility to invent a brand new word , unless an agent with both @xmath2 and @xmath4 in his list is selected . in that case",
    ", we introduce a finite probability @xmath8 that his list containing @xmath2 and @xmath4 turns into a new entry @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ es - inter ] ) .",
    "we interpret @xmath8 as a measure of the need of agents to obtain a sort of hybridization through which they understand each other , or a measure of the natural tendency of two different language forms to be synthesized together . in the latter case",
    ", different values of @xmath8 would depend on the language forms considered in a real multi language scenario .",
    "the stochastic rule @xmath9 may be applied either in the initial interaction phase by changing the dictionary of the speaker , or at the final stage by changing the state of the hearer after the interaction with the speaker . in this paper",
    "we show the results obtained by running the trasformation @xmath9 ( and also @xmath10 when a speaker has got an @xmath11 vocabulary ) before the interaction . introducing the trasformation after the interaction changes the results from a qualitative point of view , producing only a shift of transition lines between the final states in the space of parameters defining the stochastic process .     with probability @xmath8 on the speaker vocabulary .",
    "the trasformation is carried before the usual speaker - hearer ng interaction , which includes the stochastic update of the vocabularies in case of a success depending on @xmath12.,width=396 ]    a further stochastic modification of the basic naming game interaction , firstly introduced in  @xcite , has also been adopted here .",
    "it gives account for the emergence or persistance of a multilingual final state , where more than one word is associated to a single object .",
    "this is done by mimicking a sort of confidence degree among agents : in case of a successful interaction , namely when the hearer shares the word uttered by the speaker , the update trasformation of the two involved vocabularies takes place with probability @xmath12 ( the case @xmath13 obviously reduces to the basic ng ) .",

    "for @xmath16 the system converges to the usual one word consensus state ( in this case only @xmath2 or @xmath4 ) . for @xmath17",
    "the system converges to a mixed state , where more than one word remains , so that there exist single and multi word vocabularies at the end of the process ( namely @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath18 ) . a linear stability analysis of the mean field master equations of this model ( describing the evolution of vocabulary frequencies @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 ) shows that the steady state @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( or symmetrically @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , which is stable for @xmath16 , turns unstable if @xmath17 , where viceversa the steady state @xmath24 , @xmath25 emerges as a stable state , with @xmath26 being a simple algebraic expression of the parameter @xmath12 . in our work , as shown next , we found that the transition order - disorder ( i.e.  single word vs.  multi word final state ) at @xmath15 remains for all the values of @xmath8 .",

    "it seems that the use of the naming game is particularly fit , in spite of the old conception of pure languages as product of an innate psychological background of individuals @xcite",
    ".    it would be interesting to apply our model in the study of real language phenomena where a sort of hybridization of two or more languages in a contact language ecology takes ground .",
    "there are many examples of this in the history , as for example the formation of the modern romance european languages from the contact of local celtic populations with the colonial language of romans , latin .",
    "a more recent example of this is the emergence of creole languages in colonial regions where european colonialists and african slaves came into contact @xcite .",
    "the starting point for a comparison of our model with this kind of phenomena would be retrieving demographic data of the different ethnic groups at the moment they joined in the same territory and observing if a new language established .",
    "our point of view would be obviously not to understand how particular speaking forms emerged , but to understand whether there is a correlation between the success of the new language forms and the initial language demography .",
    "in this case , a more refined modeling would take into account also the temporal evolution of the population due to reproduction and displacements , and the particular topologies related to the effective interaction scheme acting in the population .",
