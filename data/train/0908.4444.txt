    "obviously , there are many potential transitions that are not allowed by the e1 mechanism .",
    "the leading order electric - dipole - forbidden transitions are electric quadrupole ( e2 ) and magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions .",

    "forbidden transitions can provide narrow resonances and thus play an important role in frequency standards and atomic clocks . in this context , optical - lattice - induced frequency shifts due to such transitions",

    "states that can decay only by dipole - forbidden transitions are usually metastable and thus play an important role in accumulating population in excited gases such as discharges . on the more fundamental side",
    ", these e1-forbidden transitions can be sensitive probes of atomic wavefunctions and thus serve an important role in testing atomic structure calculations .",
    "such tests are important to the interpretation of atomic measurements of fundamental symmetries such as parity violation @xcite .",
    "m1 transitions between states of different principal quantum number @xmath9 are especially useful in this regard as they are nominally subject to the @xmath10=0 selection rule .",
    "violations of this rule are due to relativistic and spin - orbit effects .",
    "measuring these m1 transition strengths in various atomic systems and comparing them to theory can help determine the relative importance of contributions such as negative - energy states @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we explore the e1-forbidden @xmath11 transition in rb by laser excitation of ultracold atoms .",
    "the use of ultracold atoms virtually eliminates doppler broadening and allows hyperfine - selective state preparation @xcite . with this ability to resolve specific hyperfine transitions ,",

    "they used a polarization technique to measure the relative e2 and m1 contributions to the rb @xmath11 transition and obtained an anomalously large m1 fraction , at odds with theoretical calculations . here",
    "we resolve this discrepancy in favor of theory , setting an upper limit on the m1 contribution which is larger than , and therefore consistent with , the predicted value .",
    "there have been a number of other e2/m1 ratio measurements in various atomic systems .",

    "measurements of absorption spectra and faraday rotation , combined with lineshape modeling , yielded the e2/m1 ratio @xcite . in all of these examples , the m1 process was dominant because the transitions took place within the same ground - state electronic configuration . in our case , both initial and final states are electronically excited and the transition changes @xmath9 , so the m1 process is significantly suppressed .",
    "our work also differs in that the e2-only and m1-only transitions are well resolved in our excitation spectra , obviating the need for sophisticated modeling .",

    "we believe that this counter - intuitive suppression of the optical pumping is likely caused by multiple scattering of resonance fluorescence light in the optically dense sample and/or zeeman precession of the spin in the quadrupole field of the mot @xcite .    to set a limit on the strength of the m1 transition , we fit the observed @xmath13=0@xmath72=2 ) e2 signal and the unobserved @xmath13=0@xmath72=2 ) m1 signal to a pair of gaussians separated by the 64 mhz @xmath14=1,2 ) splitting .",
    "although we do not understand the lineshape of the observed transition in detail , the scans fit quite well to gaussians with a typical full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 10 mhz , as seen in fig .",
    "the 480 ns @xcite lifetime of the @xmath58 upper state of this two - photon transition would yield a lorentzian natural linewidth of 330 khz .",
    "however , the two lasers driving this transition each have linewidths in the range of 1 - 2 mhz . also , the inhomogeneous magnetic field sampled by the atoms in the mot results in a distribution of zeeman shifts for the various magnetic sublevels .",
    "the fact that the first step of the two - photon transition is on resonance and close to saturation may also affect the lineshape .",
    "the second step ( e2 ) transition is very weak , with a transition rate estimated to be @xmath4810@xmath74 times smaller than that of the first step ( e1 ) transition .",
    "the fits are clearly not consistent with a lorentzian lineshape with the 5.9 mhz fwhm natural linewidth of the @xmath56 intermediate state . since the observed peaks for other transitions , such as those shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , are also gaussian with similar widths , we feel justified in using a gaussian fit for setting a limit on the unobserved m1 transition . understanding the details of the lineshape and its dependence on various parameters is an interesting topic for further investigation .",
    "an upper limit on the m1 transition strength is determined by least - squares fitting of a number of individual scans to a pair of gaussians .",
    "the separation between the peaks is constrained to @xmath75 mhz , and the fwhm of each gaussian is allowed to vary independently from 7 to 21 mhz .",
    "we also include constant and linear terms in the fits to account for the background and its slow drift , respectively .",
    "a total of 32 scans are included , 20 of them using pulsed preparation and the remainder using cw preparation .",
    "an example of the latter is shown in fig .",
    "for each scan we determine the ratio @xmath76 of amplitudes for the two gaussians , for comparison with the theoretical prediction obtained using eqs .",

    "this yields @xmath770.007 with 95% confidence . by this criterion ,",
    "our result is consistent with zero .",
    "we verify that omitting the linear background term from the fits has a minimal effect , changing the mean value of @xmath76 to 0.0024 and its upper limit to 0.006 .",

    "statistics connected to an f - test @xcite reveal that the gaussians fitted to the position of the m1 peak are not significant , i.e. , the probability of an actual peak at the expected location is well below 95% .",
