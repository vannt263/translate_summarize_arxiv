    "high temperature superconductivity ( sc ) was discovered in 2008 in fe pnictides @xcite , prompting detailed investigations of their structural , electronic , and magnetic properties @xcite . in particular the 122 series , with the stoichiometry @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ba , ca , and sr ) , have attracted a lot of attention because of the availability of relatively large single crystals ( @xmath12 mm@xmath13 ) , and the possibility to achieve sc by means of electron , hole , and isovalent doping @xcite . the canonical parent compound @xmath1 has a @xmath14-type structure and undergoes a tetragonal - to - orthorombic phase transition followed by collinear antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering below 140  k @xcite .",
    "the presence of an af phase close to sc is similar to other unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates and heavy fermions @xcite , and has allowed to extend theoretical magnetic pairing scenarios , previously proposed , to fe pnictides @xcite .",
    "therefore , the intimate interplay between antiferromagnetism and sc highlights the importance of a complete characterization of both static and dynamic magnetism in the fe pnictides .",
    "the ordered magnetic moment detected in @xmath1 is @xmath151 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however quantum fluctuations due to the metallicity of @xmath1 , and fe pnictides in general , hinder the determination of the value of the fluctuating magnetic moment in slow probes @xcite ( such as neutron scattering , nmr , and muon relaxation spectroscopy @xcite ) .",
    "this problem can be overcome using fast spectroscopies ( on the order of femtoseconds ) such as photoemission , x - ray emission ( xes ) , and x - ray absorption ( xas ) spectroscopy @xcite that can take snapshots of the magnetic moment and reveal higher values of the local fluctuating magnetic moment ( @xmath17 ) with respect to their slower counterparts .",
    "moreover , a lot of attention has been paid to spin excitations , with inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) being at the forefront in the measurement of spin waves in both parent and doped compounds @xcite .",
    "recently , resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) has also been able to successfully measure high energy spin excitation in parent , electron- , and hole - doped fe pnictides @xcite obtaining similar results to ins , and extending the range of experimental techniques available to map out spin excitations .",

    "eu is a rare earth element having _ f _ electrons that in the @xmath18 oxidation state are in a 4__f__@xmath19 electronic configuration and consequently eu has a total angular moment @xmath20 that is obtained from @xmath4 and @xmath5 . because of this , @xmath0 has two magnetic transitions , the first one at @xmath15190  k is analogue to @xmath1 and concerns the af ordering of the spins at the fe sites , meanwhile the second one is observed at @xmath1520  k and involves the ordering of spins on eu@xmath2 ( ref .",

    "this additional magnetic phase and the constant presence of high magnetic moment on the spacing layer do not preclude the emergence of sc when doping is performed , representing one of few cases , where ferromagnetism and sc are close in the phase diagram of fe pnictides @xcite , posing the natural question whether the high magnetic moment of eu@xmath2 affects the magnetism of the feas layer . generally , the bandwidth of the spin excitations has been observed to be affected by the geometry of the feas layer @xcite . in @xmath0",

    "xas - pfy spectra were all collected at 15  k. the energy of the incident x - rays of the xes experiments was set to 7.140 kev with @xmath30 polarization and the outgoing photon energy was scanned between 7.02 kev and 7.08 kev .",

    "we can see the main features due to dipole allowed transitions between fe-1@xmath36 and fe-4@xmath37 states ( labeled as peaks b , c , d , e , and f ) as well as a weak pre - edge at energy 7.1127 kev ( displayed also in the inset of fig .",

    "this pre - edge peak is ascribed to hybridization between fe-3@xmath38 and as-4@xmath37 orbitals , commonly seen in materials lacking inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "we observe little modification of fe - k xas - pfy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 as shown in the inset illustrating the pre - edge region , where we can see just a small difference in the width of the peak a. this small modification indicates that the hybridization and covalency between fe and as is very similar in these compounds and marginally affected by the spacing layer . a slight change in the relative intensity of the peaks d and f",
    "is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "these small effects may be ascribed to the local structural differences between the two systems originating from the different spacing layer , slightly changing the structure but not the hybridization . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , we plot the fe - l@xmath23 xas spectrum of @xmath0 together with the one of @xmath1 .",
    "the spectra display two broad peaks at @xmath15708 and 720 ev typical of fe pnictides , ascribed to the l@xmath39 and l@xmath40 absorption edges @xcite . in both compounds ,",
    "the spectra are rather similar with minor differences in the shoulder at 711 ev .",
    "usually this shoulder involves the charge transfer satellites and the small difference observed in the fe - l xas may be the effect of the different spacing layer affecting the distance between fe and as , and consequently changing the charge transfer peak , as also suggested by fe - k edge xas - pfy .",
    "clearly , fe - l edge xas confirms that in @xmath0 fe has the common @xmath18 oxidation state .",
    "furthermore , the spectra do not show any multiplet structure common to oxides , confirming the high sample quality and the success of the _ in situ _ cleaving @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of this peak is about 3 ev and is unchanged moving from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , indicating that the electronic structure is similar for the two compounds .",
    "xes is a powerful probe for the measurement of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "one excites the fe 1@xmath36 core - electron into the continuum by means of a photon ( in our case @xmath41=7.140 kev ) creating a highly unstable core - hole",
    ". this core - hole can be filled by an fe 3@xmath37 electron with the consequent emission of a photon to satisfy the energy balance .",
    "the system is then left in fe 3@xmath42 final state which has a wavefunction affected by the fe 3@xmath38 orbitals and sensitive to the spin carried by valence electrons .",
    "the xes line created in this process is the fe - k@xmath43 emission line that is composed by a main peak , due to the sum of k@xmath44 and k@xmath45 , and a satellite peak named k@xmath46 .",
    "the latter has been shown to be directly sensitive to the spin of the valence band , and using a proper calibration it is possible to extract the value of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this technique is able to probe @xmath17 in the femtosecond range overcoming the drawback of the quenching of the magnetic moment due to quantum fluctuations concerning other probes @xcite .",
    "we show xes spectra in fig .",

    "the reference spectrum collected on fecras , which has been chosen , as in previous works @xcite , because of the absence of magnetic moment on fe atoms and represents a suitable reference material to apply the integrated absolute difference ( iad ) method @xcite .",
    "additionally in fig .  [ fig : fig2](a ) and ( b ) we illustrate as blue shadowed region the difference spectra obtained after using the same center of mass and subtraction of the reference spectrum as described in previous works @xcite .",
    "this procedure allows to determine the value of @xmath47 for @xmath0 at 15  k and 1.45@xmath48 at 300  k. the values measured for @xmath0 are similar to the values obtained for @xmath1 ( @xmath47 at 15  k and @xmath49 at 300  k ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , the small increase of @xmath17 with temperature is consistent with what is observed in other fe pnictides @xcite and demonstrates that the use of fermi surface nesting arguments as the sole source of magnetic ordering in @xmath0 is inappropriate @xcite . the increase of @xmath17 with temperature is incompatible with the nesting scenario and it has been shown that instead a spin freezing transition driven by the competition of hund s coupling , electronic screening , and fermi surface nesting arguments is more likely and in agreement with systematic spectroscopic measurements on parent and doped fe pnictides @xcite .",
