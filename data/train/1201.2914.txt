    "the pclet number ( pe ) measures the ratio of convective to thermal forces . at low pe numbers , where thermal forces dominate",
    ", one might expect that properties such as the structure of a colloidal suspension would be well approximated by their values at equilibrium ( where pe is strictly zero ) . on the other hand , at larger pe numbers , purely non - equilibrium phenomena should become more prominent  @xcite .    nonetheless , the precise conditions under which the transition from equilibrium like to purely non - equilibrium behaviour occurs is a subtle question and depends on which properties are under investigation .",
    "for example , equilibrium correlation functions are often applied to calculate the properties of non - equilibrium systems . at what @xmath1 number does this approximation break down ?    to address such questions , we study the interplay of thermal and convective forces in steady - state sedimentation , a classical non - equilibrium problem that , despite its apparent simplicity , it is still far from completely understood  @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty for theories arises from the long - ranged ( @xmath2 ) nature of the solvent induced hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) that couple the motion of the particles in a complex way . indeed ,",
    "although stokes @xcite calculated the sedimentation velocity @xmath3 of a single hard sphere in 1851 , it was necessary to wait more than 120 years until batchelor @xcite derived the first correction in the dilute limit , which is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the average sedimentation velocity of the colloids and @xmath0 is the particle volume fraction .",
    "although this is strictly a non - equilibrium effect , it has been shown by simulations  @xcite that for hard sphere ( hs ) particles , the behaviour of @xmath6 is virtually independent of pe number down to at least @xmath7 .",
    "so , for this example , a non - equilibrium effect persists virtually unchanged well into a regime where the thermal forces are significantly stronger than the convective forces .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a thermodynamic component to this non - equilibrium problem by studying the effect of short - ranged attractive interactions on colloidal sedimentation at different @xmath1 numbers .",
    "nearly 30 years ago batchelor calculated the effect of short - range interactions beyond the hs model on the average sedimentation velocity in the dilute limit @xcite , finding : @xmath8\\phi + { \\cal o}(\\phi^2)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the second virial coefficient , and @xmath11 is the virial coefficient calculated with the effective hs radius of the colloids .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) suggests that adding attractions should increase the sedimentation velocity , while adding repulsions should decrease it compared to the pure hs case .",
    "an intuition for the increase in sedimentation velocity with attractions at low packing fractions can be obtained from the following considerations : attractions should increase the probability of ( transient ) cluster formation .",
    "the sedimentation force scales linearly with the number @xmath12 of particles in the cluster , whereas the friction is proportional to the radius of gyration of the cluster , which typically scales as @xmath13 , so that the sedimentation velocity of a cluster scales as @xmath14 . for compact clusters @xmath15 whereas for more open clusters @xmath16 can be larger , although it can not be greater than one . even in the regime",
    "where the attractions are not strong enough to form permanent clusters , transient clusters can form , leading to a speed up in the average sedimentation velocity .    in the dilute limit",
    ", the increase in @xmath5 with increasing strength of attractions has been observed experimentally  @xcite . on the other hand , as the packing fraction increases",
    ", the gap between nearest neighbours decreases and so the fluid locally experiences an enhanced friction , which eventually slows down the average sedimentation velocity .",
    "what happens in between these two limiting regimes has been recently studied by gilleland et al .",
    "@xcite , who calculated @xmath6 theoretically in the @xmath17 limit , and who first predicted a maximum as a function of @xmath0 for strong enough attractions .",
    "we applied the same mesoscopic simulation technique we used for hs particles in  @xcite to colloids with several different attractive interactions and also found that for strong enough attractions ( but still below the point at which permanent clusters form ) a similar maximum can be observed  @xcite .",
    "these simulations were performed at just one intermediate @xmath18 , where the pclet number is defined as @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the particle hydrodynamic radius , and @xmath21 is the equilibrium self - diffusion coefficient for a single colloid at infinite dilution .    here",
    "we investigate the effect of varying the @xmath1 number at one fixed attractive interaction strength .",
    "we find that the maximum in @xmath6 v.s .",
    "@xmath0 is stable for @xmath22 , but starts to diminish at @xmath23 and has completely disappeared by @xmath24",
    ". we also measure the colloid - colloid radial distribution function @xmath25 , and find that deviations from the equilibrium form begin to emerge for @xmath26 .",
    "the properties of the clusters formed in irreversible aggregation processes under sedimentation has been studied by means of brownian dynamics simulations in the region of low pe number ( @xmath27 ) in  @xcite .",
    "although permanent clusters do nt form at equilibrium in our system , the attractions do promote transient cluster formation .",
    "thus , fragmentation combines with aggregation and sedimentation processes studied previously .",
    "in contrast to the brownian dynamics simulations , we also include the effects of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "we find that increasing the pe number reduces the number of larger clusters , and that for a given cluster size , the number of fragmentation events grows with increasing pe , while the number of aggregation events decreases with increasing pe .",
    "we proceed as follows : in the methods section we introduce our model potentials and describe the stochastic rotation dynamics computer simulation technique we employ . in the results section",
    "we then present and discuss the effect of pe number on @xmath6 , @xmath25 and on cluster distributions , and then summarize our findings in the final section .",
    "we employ a hybrid simulation method that treats the colloids with molecular dynamics ( md ) and includes a background fluid that is by calculated with the stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) approach  @xcite .",
    "such a hybrid technique was first employed by malevanets and kapral  @xcite , and we adapted it to study steady state sedimentation of hs particles in  @xcite , and particles with attractive interactions in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the method has recently been shown to quantitatively describe colloidal sedimentation experiments , including complex nonlinear effects such as rayleigh taylor instabilities  @xcite .",
    "srd itself ( or multi particle collision dynamics as it is also called ) has been fruitfully applied to a large number of other problems as well  @xcite .",
    "these previous successes give us confidence to apply this method to the problem of pe number effects on sedimentation .    within srd ,",
    "the fluid is not treated as a continuous solvent , but instead it is modelled by point - like particles .",
    "thus the system is composed of @xmath28 solvent particles of mass @xmath29 , and @xmath30 colloids of mass @xmath31 .",
    "collisions between solvent particles are efficiently coarse - grained in such a way that mass , momentum and energy are locally conserved , leading to the macroscopic navier - stokes equations  @xcite . at the same time , brownian motion of colloids is achieved naturally through colloid - solvent collisions . as srd also includes thermal noise , the method represents a powerful technique to simulate driven colloidal suspensions embedded in a fluid .",
    "the choice of the simulation parameters must be done in a way that the most important dimensionless numbers fall in the correct hydrodynamic regime .",

    "we note that there is some ambiguity in exactly how to obtain the effective diameter , as other recipes could be employed , but because of the steepness of the colloid - colloid interaction the differences are typically small , so we use this very simple one .",

    "after an initial transient time , the system reaches steady - state conditions , where the average sedimentation velocity @xmath5 is constant , the colloidal microstructure does not depend on time , and no drift is observed in other measured observables either . in our simulations , we varied pe from 0.5 to 10 by increasing the gravitational field .",
    "averages were collected over runs from 5000 stokes times @xmath70 ( for pe = 0.5 ) to @xmath71 ( for pe = 10 ) , where @xmath72 is the time it takes an isolated sphere to settle one particle radius .",
    "one could also define a brownian time @xmath73 , which is proportional to the time it takes the colloid to diffuse one radius",
    ". then @xmath74 , and averages are taken over periods ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 brownian times , which should be ample for thermodynamic averaging .",
    "we work in a frame where the downward volume flux of colloids is compensated by an equivalent upward volume flux of fluid . in all cases",
    "the value of the reynolds numberi is kept small ( @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the kinematic viscosity ) , in order to ensure that the hydrodynamic behaviour of our system corresponds to the stokesian regime typical for colloids .",

    "the hydrodynamic packing fraction is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the colloidal number density .",
    "the hydrodynamic radius @xmath20 is used because this sets the scale for the hydrodynamic interactions ( one can also define a packing fraction based on colloid - colloid interactions , but this will typically be higher that the hydrodynamic one ; the system is effectively non - additive  @xcite ) . for hard spheres , as we increase the particle concentration , the hydrodynamic effect of the solvent leads to a rapid decrease of @xmath5 , as first predicted by batchelor  @xcite . as found in  @xcite , @xmath79 is virtually independent of pe number , and is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of hayakawa and ichiki  @xcite and with experimental data obtained for @xmath86 .",

    "[ pe05_10](b ) , at least for small pe numbers ( @xmath89 ) the slope of the linear region at low @xmath0 , i.e.  the sedimentation coefficient , is consistent with the batchelor theory that , through eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , predicts that @xmath90 , which agrees well with our simulation data .",
    "on the other hand , at high @xmath0 , the fluid must pass through a dense collection of colloids and so we expect @xmath6 to eventually decrease with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover between these two regions explains the maximum observed in fig .",
    "[ pe05_10](a ) . for @xmath22",
    "the whole curve is independent of pe , at least within the accuracy that we can measure .",
    "in contrast to what was found for hs systems , increasing the pe number above this regime does change the behaviour significantly .",
    "for example , there is a progressive reduction of the maximum . for @xmath91 ,",
    "this reduction is strong enough to completely remove the maximum .",
    "the dilute regime also becomes affected . for @xmath92",
    "the sedimentation coefficient starts to noticeably decrease compared to the one predicted by the batchelor .",
    "the critical value of the pclet number that leads to this non - monotonic behaviour depends on the interaction potential , but for short - ranged interactions a maximum can occur for sufficiently small pe numbers if @xmath93 .",
    "as pe increases , we expect the maximum to disappear .",
    "preliminary simulations at other @xmath58s suggest that the weaker the attractions , the lower the critical pe number at which the monotonic behaviour sets in . on the other hand , for strong enough attractions , permanent clusters will form and lead to different physics than what we are considering here .",
    "it is known that the criterion @xmath94 provides a remarkably accurate prediction of the potential strength at which a critical point sets in  @xcite .",
    "of course the critical point is only at one concentration , so one could potentially reach a slightly more negative @xmath58 at lower concentrations as long as the fluid - fluid binodal or spinodal towards phase separation ( and permanent cluster formation ) is not crossed ( note that the location of these lines will be affected by the sedimentation as well ) .",
    "one must also take care not to cross a fluid - solid binodal or other phase - lines .",
    "we illustrate the region of non - monotonic behaviour with a schematic diagram in fig .",
    "[ pe_b2 ] .",
    "in order to investigate further the possible causes for the change of @xmath95 with pe , we also studied the microstructure of the suspensions , including radial distribution functions and cluster distributions .",

    "both hs and attractive colloids do not vary appreciably with pe , and agree with the equilibrium distributions ( at @xmath99 ) . for larger pe numbers we observe a small deviation for the hs correlation functions , including the emergence of a small but distinct hydrodynamically induced anti - correlation region around @xmath100 for @xmath24 .",
    "note that the scale of the changes is very small , so that the effect on @xmath6 is expected to be very modest as well , most likely well within the error bars of our calculation of sedimentation coefficients we measure .",
    "in contrast to the case for hs particles , for attractive interactions the effect of pe number on the pair correlations is much more pronounced . for pe @xmath101 ,",
    "@xmath102 is indistinguishable from its @xmath103 form , which at these low packing fractions can be accurately reproduced by the dilute limit expressions @xmath104}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "as we increase the pe number above 1 , the main peak of @xmath102 begins to noticeably decrease in magnitude . at pe=10 ,",
    "the deviations are quite substantial",
    ". one measure of this hydrodynamic effect can be quantified by measuring the average number of nearest neighbours around a particle , which is given by the integral of @xmath25 from @xmath105 to the position of the first minimum(located at @xmath106 ) : @xmath107 as shown in fig .",
    "[ neig ] , @xmath108 drops from 2.39 to 2.02 as we increase pe from 1 to 10 .",
    "in other words , here the effect of increasing the relative strength of the convective over thermodynamic forces reduces the probability that two particles are in close proximity .    in the @xmath109 limit , instead of the equilibrium correlation function @xmath110",
    ", one could also use the measured non - equilibrium @xmath25 in the derivation leading to eq .",

    "when we use the measured @xmath25 for pe = 10 , we find that @xmath111 .",
    "the sedimentation coefficient now has the opposite sign to that found when using the @xmath25 at pe = 0 , and in fact fits the data for p = 10 reasonably well , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pe05_10](b ) .",
    "this example illustrates the danger of using equilibrium correlation functions in non - equilibrium calculations .",
    "next we focus on another measure of microstructure , namely cluster distributions .",
    "two particles are considered to be in a cluster if they are within a cutoff radius of @xmath112 of each other , which places them well inside the attractive potential well .",
    "other cutoffs could be used , but these do nt qualitatively change the behaviour we observe .",
    "the clusters are transient , that is they form and break up due to thermal and convective forces . moreover , in steady - state , the average cluster distributions should not change with time ( although fluctuations may occur caused by finite size effects ) . using this criterion , we measured the probability distribution of transient clusters @xmath113 and their average life - time @xmath114 as a function of the cluster size , @xmath12 .",
    "we used the same criterion to calculate cluster distributions for hs particles .    for hs particles , both properties",
    "are only weakly affected by pe number over the range we study .",
    "in contrast , for attractive particles , fig .  [ csd_pe](a ) demonstrates that increasing pe leads to a substantial decrease of the probability of finding large clusters . at low packing fractions",
    ", this may help explain the decrease of the average sedimentation coefficient with increasing pe number , as larger clusters are expected to sediment faster .",
    "given that there are fewer large clusters with increasing pe number , and that convective forces increase with pe , one might also expect a decrease of the the cluster - life times as pe grows . however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ csd_pe](b ) , for @xmath97 , the cluster life - times are nearly independent of pe number over the range of pe numbers we investigate . we note that this surprising effect seems limited to very low @xmath0 . at @xmath115 , we do observe a decrease in cluster life - times with increasing pe . to explain why the average life - times of the clusters does not change at low @xmath0 it is important to think further about the processes that lead to a certain cluster size .",
    "these include both aggregation processes , whereby smaller clusters coagulate into larger ones , and fragmentation processes where a larger cluster breaks up into smaller ones .",
    "the larger the cluster , the more different formation and breakup pathways that are available .",
    "the life - time of a cluster can decrease both because the rate of aggregation increases or because the rate of fragmentation increases .    to study the statistics of fragmentation and aggregation , we tracked , over a suitably long averaging time , the number of times a given cluster of size @xmath12 decreased in size due to fragmentation events , @xmath116 as well as the number of times it increased in size due to aggregation events , @xmath117 .",
    "these numbers increase linearly with time , so it is useful to define normalized quantities @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the total number of times that a cluster of size @xmath12 emerges during the averaging time . in steady state ,",
    "@xmath121 , so that each can be viewed as a probability that a cluster of size @xmath12 disappears by either fragmentation or aggregation respectively .",
    "these probabilities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ pagg ] for pe=1 and pe=10 .",
    "we see firstly that the probability of aggregation decreases with increasing cluster size , whereas the rate of fragmentation increases with increasing @xmath12 , as one might expect because there are more ways a large cluster can break up .",
    "moreover , these probabilities change with pe number . for higher pe number the probability of fragmentation increases , as one might expect due to the increased relative strength of shear forces over thermal forces .",
    "however , the probability of aggregation also decreases due to the flow .",
    "the combination of these two rates apparently balance each other out , and so the average life - time of a cluster at @xmath97 appears not to change with increasing pe number . at higher packing fractions these cluster life - times do change .",
    "by contrast , the increase in the probability of fragmentation , combined with the decrease in the probability of aggregation does lead to a decrease in the _ number _ of larger clusters . clearly",
    "the effect of changing the balance of convective to thermal forces on the aggregation and fragmentation of clusters is complex .",
    "a fuller investigation would not only track the cluster size distributions , but also the different pathways of formation / breakup .",
    "a future publication will investigate these effects in more detail .",
    "in summary , we have used a mesoscopic simulation technique to study the effect of changing the balance between thermal and convective forces , quantified by the pe number , in a sedimenting suspension of colloidal particles . whereas for pure hs particles",
    "the effects of varying the pe number between 0.1 and 10 are quite small  @xcite , for attractive particles there is a clear change in behaviour over this range of pe numbers .",
    "firstly , the maximum in the sedimentation velocity @xmath6 with @xmath0 , first predicted in  @xcite , and observed by simulations in  @xcite , disappears as the pe number increases .",
    "secondly , the radial distribution function @xmath25 changes noticeably for pe @xmath122 : increasing the pe number means the average number of nearest neighbours decreases compared do the equilibrium value .",
    "thirdly , the cluster distributions change : the probability of observing larger clusters decreases with increasing pe . moreover , increasing the pe number increases the probability that a transient cluster fragments , and decreases the probability that it aggregates with another particle or with other clusters .",
    "this work illustrates the often complex crossover from equilibrium - like to purely non - equilibrium behaviour as the balance between thermal and convective forces changes .",
    "a number of further questions are raised by this study .",
    "first of all , we only used one fairly short - ranged potential form .",
    "it would be interesting to see how these results depend on the shape of the potential .",
    "for example , a longer - ranged attractive potential with the same integrated strength , which through eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) would generate a similar sedimentation coefficient , would have a less deep dimensionless well depth @xmath123 .",
    "one might expect that finite pe number effects set in roughly when @xmath124 pe , i.e. when the shear forces are strong enough to dislodge particles that cluster together @xcite . thus a for a longer - ranged potential , finite pe number effects should set in earlier than for a shorter - ranged potential .",
    "similarly , it would be interesting to investigate what the effect of pe number is on longer - ranged repulsive potentials  @xcite .",
    "another interesting direction of investigation would be to study what happens at larger interaction strengths where permanent clusters can form .",
    "the shape of clusters  @xcite will most likely also depend on pe number , and we anticipate a rich physics as a function of the interplay between the aggregation of clusters and the convective forces driven by their sedimentation .    the authors thank the spanish ministerio de educacin y ciencia ( project mat2009 - 13155-c04 - 02 ) , the junta de andaluca ( excellency project p07-fqm-02517 ) and the royal society ( london ) for financial support ."
