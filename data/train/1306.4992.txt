    "<S> [ fig : lifetimeqf]a shows @xmath76 as determined from the cross - power spectral density of quasiparticle fluctuations in the amplitude and the phase of the resonator @xcite . panels b and c show the measured @xmath22 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the power range for this noise measurement is only 10 db , due to the amplifier noise limit . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath22 increases with increasing power , consistent with fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : simresults]d . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have a nonlinear conductivity effect due to quasiparticle redistribution , where @xmath22 increases despite of the creation of excess quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with situations in which excess quasiparticles are introduced either on purpose or due to the environment @xcite where @xmath79 , although also in qubits subtleties can occur due to @xmath8 @xcite .    the qualitative agreement between measurements and calculations as apparent from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s21qf]b is quite satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of the microwave power on @xmath22 and @xmath21 is less than calculated . </S>",
    "<S> since the uncertainty in the measured @xmath14 is less than 2 db , there should be a parallel dissipation channel . </S>",
    "<S> so far we assumed the same @xmath8 for the groundplane of the resonator and the central strip . </S>",
    "<S> future work may include the calculation of @xmath8 in the groundplane , which is difficult due to the additional complexity of quasiparticle outdiffusion . </S>",
    "<S> a crude approximation , where the groundplane is an impedance with a thermal @xmath8 , in series with the non - equilibrium central strip @xcite , indicates indeed a reduced non - equilibrium effect of microwave power on @xmath22 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium f(e ) could be measured by combining the resonator experiment with tunnel probes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in closing we emphasize that for the non - equilibrium @xmath8 to occur ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : distributions]a ) , quasiparticle - phonon scattering has to be slow compared to @xmath50 and to @xmath47 , which is therefore more likely in materials with a low @xmath10 , such as al @xcite . in addition , redistribution of quasiparticles at low temperatures leads to @xmath80 @xcite , which implies that even in the few microwave photon regime this mechanism leads to excess quasiparticles .    </S>",
