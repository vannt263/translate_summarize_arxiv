    "in classical elasticity one assumes that the elements of a material continuum are structureless points which are characterized by their positions only , whereas their internal properties ( such as orientation , deformation etc ) are disregarded .",
    "this picture is generalized to the concept of continua with microstructure when a material body or fluid is formed of a large number of deformable particles whose ( micro)elastic properties contribute to the macroscopic dynamics of such a material medium .",
    "the corresponding mechanical model was developed very early by the cosserat brothers @xcite who replaced a structureless material point by a point that carries a triad of axes ( an oriented frame , in the modern geometrical language ) .",
    "this idea has led to a rich variety of models which are known by various different names like oriented or multipolar medium , asymmetric elasticity , micropolar elasticity , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this field is also related to other areas of continuum mechanics , like the theory of ferromagnetic materials , cracked media , liquid crystals @xcite , superfluids @xcite and granular media ( see , for example , application of the cosserat model to the description of the grain size effects in metallic polycrystal @xcite ) .    in general case ,",
    "the 3-frame attached to material elements is deformable , thus introducing nine new degrees of freedom in addition to the classical elasticity ( 3 rotations , 1 volume expansion , and 5 shear deformations ) ; this is usually called a micromorphic continuum @xcite .",
    "a special case is the microstretch continuum for which the 3-frame can rotate and change volume ( 4 degrees of freedom : 3 microrotations and 1 microvolume expansion ) . finally , in the micropolar continuum , the structured material point is rigid , thus possessing 3 microrotation degrees of freedom .",
    "the last is the subject of the cosserat elasticity that considers media which can experience displacements and microrotations . in turn",
    ", this theory has two important limiting cases , one with no microrotations which is the classical elasticity , and the second case where one assumes that the medium only experiences microrotations and no displacements .",
    "models of the latter type have in fact a long history which can be traced back to maccullagh in 1839 , see  @xcite",
    ". recently  @xcite such models have been investigated in the fully nonlinear setting and plane wave type solutions were explicitly constructed .",
    "the existence of such solutions is a highly non - trivial fact . in a linearised",
    "setting , similar solutions were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen a revival of elasticity , in particular in the theory of dislocations which has been analysed from a gauge theoretic point of view . the gauge approach was developed and successfully applied in high energy physics and in the theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the gauge approach in elasticity also has a long and rich history , see for example @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that the dislocations behave very much like particles . from a more formal point of view ,",
    "one of the open questions in this field of research is whether or not it is possible to find soliton type solutions which could justify the particle interpretation from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the main result of this paper is that we are able to find soliton type solutions in a particular model of elasticity motivated by gauge theories of gravity .",
    "our notation and conventions follow the book @xcite where the modern differential geometry of manifolds is presented . here",
    "we briefly summarize the notions and define objects needed for our current study .",
    "we consider an elastic medium which occupies the whole of @xmath0 , and we can identify material points with points in space .",
    "we use the latin alphabet to label the coordinate indices , @xmath1 , say , we write @xmath2 for the spatial ( holonomic ) coordinates of @xmath3 , a 3-dimensional simply connected manifold which we identify with the material points of the continuum .",
    "this manifold occupies the entire 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "greek indices refer to the ( co)frame indices ( also tangent space or anholonomic indices ) , we use @xmath4 to label the frame covectors ( 1 forms ) @xmath5 which we can refer to as the distortion in elasticity .",
    "we follow the einstein summation convention whereby we sum over twice repeated indices .",
    "we denote the frame by @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 . the @xmath8 form the basis vectors of the tangent manifold @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes the interior product .",
    "the euclidean metric @xmath11 is defined on @xmath3 as a scalar product @xmath12 . as usual , the values of this scalar product on the basis vectors introduce the metric tensor @xmath13 , the components of which for the cartesian coordinates read @xmath14 .",
    "the components of the metric @xmath15 in an arbitrary basis are obviously related to the frame components via @xmath16 .",
    "one can think of @xmath17 as a set of three mutually orthogonal and normal covectors which form a basis at any point @xmath18 .",
    "each such basis covector has components @xmath19 and thus we can also view the object @xmath20 as an orthogonal matrix .",
    "we can think of the metric of the deformed medium as the cauchy - green tensor in elasticity .",
    "technically , the metric is used to raise and lower the indices , for example we obtain a covector - valued 1-form from a vector - valued coframe as @xmath21 , etc .",
    "the components of the coframe comprise the @xmath22 matrix @xmath20 which is inverse to matrix composed of the frame components @xmath23 . from the definitions we directly obtain the following identity @xmath24 .",
    "one can draw a close analogy between gravity and elasticity , see the instructive discussion @xcite , for example .",
    "the force and the hyperforce ( or the couple - force ) , as well as the stress ( force per area ) and the hyperstress ( couple per area ) , caused by the force and hyperforce , respectively , are the basic concepts in the continuum mechanics of structured media .",
    "the direct gravitational counterparts of the stress and hyperstress are the energy - momentum current and the hypermomentum ( that includes spin , dilation and shear currents ) .",
    "the spacetime itself is geometrically modelled as a continuum deformed under the action of the sources with nontrivial `` stress '' ( energy - momentum ) and `` hyperstress '' ( spin current , e.g. ) . using this correspondence , it is possible to put both gravity theory and elasticity theory into the same differential - geometric framework in which the metric , coframe , and connection are the fundamental field variables .",
    "we refer the reader for more formalism and technical detail to the comprehensive review @xcite .",
    "when considering deformations of an elastic material , one places certain compatibility conditions on the induced stress .",
    "these so called saint - venant compatibility conditions are a form of integrability conditions so that the stress can be expressed and the symmetric derivative of the displacement . in a more geometrical language , by deforming the medium , we do not want to induce any curvature into the material .",
    "this means that one assumes the riemann curvature tensor of the deformed medium to vanish identically .",
    "it is well known that these two views are equivalent , see for instance  @xcite . in the continuum theory of media with defects",
    "@xcite , the elastic properties of a crystal are described by means of the non - riemannian geometries in which the notion of curvature is supplemented by a new geometrical quantity called torsion which was first introduced by cartan in 1922 .",
    "therefore , we will analyse elastic materials using the language of the riemann - cartan geometries with torsion and we will stick to the well established requirement of having vanishing total curvature .",
    "the latter condition is sometimes called a second basic law in the differential geometry of media with defects @xcite , and it has the physical meaning that the crystal structure is uniquely defined everywhere , see also @xcite . in the following subsection we will collect the most important facts of such geometries .      let us describe each material point of our elastic material by a coframe @xmath17 ( a vector - valued 1-form ) and a connection @xmath25 ( a matrix - valued 1-form ) .",
    "recall that the latter arises from the computation of the covariant derivative @xmath26 along a vector field @xmath27 of the frame vectors , @xmath28 , see sec .",
    "c.1 of @xcite .",
    "the connection is assumed to be metric - compatible which means the vanishing nonmetricity @xmath29 , hence the connection 1-form is skew - symmetric , @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 ) .",
    "the coframe specifies the orientation of the orthonormal basis vectors at this point , while the connection determines how an arbitrary vector is parallelly transported near this point .",
    "the vanishing of the riemann - cartan curvature tensor ( a matrix valued 2-form ) takes the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the exterior derivative and @xmath34 is the exterior ( alternating ) product . in geometries where the riemann - cartan curvature identically vanishes the connection",
    "is often referred to as a weitzenbck connection .",
    "the condition @xmath35 is known in the literature by various names like teleparallel , fernparallel of distant parallel geometry .",
    "geometrically this condition means that the notion of parallelism is no longer a local statement , but can be defined globally , this means on the entire manifold .",
    "a straight line connecting two material points defines an absolute notion of parallelism .",
    "physically the condition ( [ rzero ] ) has the meaning that the structure of an elastic medium is uniquely defined everywhere in @xmath3 , @xcite .",
    "the only nonvanishing geometrical object in such geometries is cartan s torsion ( a vector valued 2-form ) defined by @xmath36",
    "let @xmath37 denote the volume 3-form , then the dual forms of the products of the coframe are defined by @xmath38 the operator @xmath39 , introduced by the formulas above , is called the hodge operator.the dual forms satisfy the following useful identities @xmath40 the object @xmath41 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol with @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 is the only nontrivial geometric object , it is therefore the only non - trivial object characterising the deformations of the medium .",
    "it is natural to decompose it into its irreducible pieces which will serve as our building blocks of elastic invariants .",
    "the torsion @xmath44 is represented as a rank 3 tensor which is skew - symmetric in one pair of indices , @xmath45 .",
    "it has 9 independent components .",
    "since we work in @xmath0 , it is also natural to consider the hodge dual of torsion which can be regarded as a @xmath22 matrix with no _ a priori _ symmetries . at any point",
    "we can view a @xmath22 matrix as an element of a 9 dimensional vector space @xmath46 .",
    "performing rotations which leave the metric invariant will change the components of this matrix , thus the group @xmath47 acts on @xmath46 and we are interested in identifying invariant subspaces .",
    "those give rise to the so - called irreducible pieces of either this matrix , or its hodge dual , the torsion tensor .",
    "therefore , let us define @xmath48 .",
    "the three irreducible pieces of torsion are defined by @xmath49 as we already explained , the metric is used for the raising and lowering of the indices , i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    the irreducible pieces ( [ t2])-([t1 ] ) can be conveniently understood in tensor language as the skew - symmetric part , the trace part , and the traceless symmetric part of the matrix , see the discussion below and in particular the explicit formulas ( [ ts3])-([ts1 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that there is a gauge freedom in choosing the variables @xmath52 .",
    "all coframes are related to each other by means of local rotations .",
    "therefore , the same elastic medium can be described equivalently by another pair @xmath53 which is related to the former by means of the gauge transformation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an arbitrary @xmath22 rotation matrix , this means @xmath56 .",
    "the covariant condition @xmath35 is preserved by this gauge transformations , whereas torsion @xmath43 transforms covariantly , @xmath57 .    making use of the local transformations ( [ trav])-([trag ] )",
    ", we can eliminate either of the variables in the pair @xmath58 .",
    "the ability to do this is closely to our assumption of a globally flat manifold  ( [ rzero ] ) .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite , the teleparallel connection is gauged away @xmath59 , and the coframe @xmath17 is left as the only variable .",
    "alternatively in  @xcite the coframe is gauged to the standard constant values @xmath60 and the only variable is the connection , in which case once can write @xmath61 here @xmath62 parametrises a teleparallel connection .",
    "we will refer to this choice of variables as the connection gauge since the only dynamical variable is the connection .",
    "the natural potential energy is based on the sum of the three quadratic microrotational elastic invariants constructed from the nonvanishing torsion @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , are non - negative constants which are physically interpreted as elastic moduli .",
    "the non - negativity of the material constants @xmath64 is a consequence of the condition of the positive semi - definiteness of the microrotational elastic energy , @xmath66 , in complete agreement with @xcite .    in general",
    ", @xmath67 can depend arbitrarily on the torsion , but the choice of the quadratic function ( [ v0 ] ) yields the linear constitutive law , @xcite . when our medium occupies the whole of @xmath0 , the three quadratic terms in ( [ v0 ] ) are not independent because of the teleparallel condition ( [ rzero ] ) .",
    "recall that there is an identity ( see eq .",
    "( 5.9.18 ) of  @xcite ) that is valid in @xmath68-dimensional space : @xmath69\\wedge * t_\\alpha    - d\\left(2\\vartheta^\\alpha\\wedge * t_\\alpha\\right).\\label{t2id}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the tilde denotes the riemannian geometric objects , i.e. those constructed from the christoffel symbols of the corresponding riemannian metric of the manifold .",
    "taking into account that the riemann - cartan curvature vanishes due to the teleparallel constraint ( [ rzero ] ) and that by assumption the elastic medium is embedded in a flat euclidean space with @xmath70 , for @xmath71 the identity ( [ t2id ] ) allows us to express the square of the first ( tensor ) irreducible part in terms of the trace and axial trace squares : @xmath72    in tensor language , using ( [ t2 ] ) , ( [ t3 ] ) , and ( [ veta1 ] ) , ( [ veta2 ] ) , we have @xmath73    it is straightforward to establish relation between the irreducible parts of the torsion 2-form @xmath43 and its dual 1-form @xmath74 .",
    "we have @xmath75 , denote the matrix @xmath76 by @xmath77 , and we find explicitly the decomposition of the second rank tensor @xmath78 into the trace , antisymmetric and traceless symmetric parts : @xmath79      in the recent papers @xcite , the propagation of waves was studied in the structured medium under consideration .",
    "the results obtained describe the elastic waves in the two complementary pictures which arise due to the two different choices of the variables allowed by the gauge freedom ( [ trav])-([trag ] ) . in  @xcite",
    ", the coframe gauge is used when the connection is zero ( completely gauged out ) .",
    "the components of the coframe are the only dynamical variables .",
    "geometrically , they represent an arbitrary orthogonal @xmath22 matrix .",
    "since the connection is trivial in this gauge , the torsion 2-form reduces to @xmath80 . using the components of the coframe and frame , @xmath81 , @xmath82",
    ", we have for the holonomic torsion @xmath83 the dual 1-form then reads @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the levi - civita tensor with respect to the holonomic coordinate basis .    a complementary approach is developed in  @xcite , where the only dynamical variable is the connection , whereas the coframe is fixed to its trivial constant value @xmath86 .",
    "the torsion ( [ tor ] ) reduces in this gauge to @xmath87 , and since in the weitzenbck space the connection is given by ( [ gam ] ) , we have @xmath88 denoting @xmath89 , we thus have @xmath90 this is completely equivalent to ( [ ti ] ) , with the difference that the orthogonal matrix @xmath91 , representing the coframe , is replaced with the orthogonal matrix @xmath92 , representing the connection .    in  @xcite , there are two technical deviations as compared to the model developed in  @xcite .",
    "the first deviation is the different choice of the variables mentioned above . noticing that @xmath93 is skew - symmetric in @xmath94 ( being an element of the lie algebra of the orthogonal group ) , in  @xcite one chooses as a basic variable a new @xmath95 matrix @xmath96 which has no a priori symmetries .",
    "this @xmath97 denotes the dualization operator which relates skew symmetric matrices to vectors , similar to the hodge @xmath39 operator .",
    "writing out the indices explicitly , this matrix can be written in the following way @xmath98 this quantity is known in the polar elasticity theory under various different names : the nye tensor @xcite , the wryness tensor @xcite , the second cosserat deformation tensor @xcite , the third order right micropolar curvature tensor @xcite , or torsion - curvature tensor ( note that this is somewhat a misnomer since it neither directly relates to torsion nor curvature in the sense of differential geometry ) .",
    "the inverse of ( [ aij ] ) yields the components of the torsion tensor ( [ tig ] ) @xmath99 substituting this into ( [ tig ] ) , we can find a relation between the the second rank tensor @xmath77 ( which we can view as a matrix in @xmath0 ) to the matrix @xmath100 , so that @xmath101    the second deviation of  @xcite from  @xcite is a different structure of the lagrangian .",
    "namely , the lagrangian of a rotationally elastic medium is assumed in  @xcite to be a function of orthogonal matrix only .",

    "<S> mathematically this is due to the fact that our equations of motion are of sine - gordon type and thus have soliton type solutions . </S>",
    "<S> similar to skyrmions and kinks in classical field theory , we can show explicitly that these solutions have a topological origin . </S>"
