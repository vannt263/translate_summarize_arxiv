    "in many combinatorial optimization problems we seek an object composed of some elements of a finite set whose total cost is minimum .",
    "this is the case , for example , in an important class of network problems where the set of elements consists of all arcs of some network and we wish to find an object in this network such as a path , a spanning tree , or a matching whose total cost is minimum . in general , the combinatorial optimization problems can often be expressed as 0 - 1 programming problems with a linear objective function , where a binary variable is associated with each element and a set of constraints describes the set of feasible solutions . for a comprehensive description of this class of problems",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the usual assumption in combinatorial optimization is that all the element costs are precisely known .",
    "however , the assumption that all the costs are known in advance is often unrealistic . in practice , before solving a problem , we only know a set of possible realizations of the element costs .",
    "this set is called a _ scenario set _ and each particular realization of the element costs within this scenario set is called a _",
    "scenario_. several methods of defining scenario sets have been proposed in the existing literature .",
    "discrete _ and _ interval _ uncertainty representations are among the most popular ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the former",
    ", scenario set contains a finite number of explicitly given cost vectors . in the latter one , for each element an interval of its possible values is specified and scenario set is the cartesian product of these intervals . in the discrete uncertainty representation , each scenario can model some event that has a global influence on the element costs . on the other hand , the interval uncertainty representation is appropriate when each element cost may vary within some range independently on the values of the other costs . a modification of the interval uncertainty representation was proposed in  @xcite , where the authors assumed that only a fixed and a priori given number of costs may vary .",
    "more general scenario sets which can be used in mathematical programming problems were discussed , for example , in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that no additional information , for example a probability distribution , for scenario set is provided .",
    "if scenario set contains more than one scenario , then an additional criterion is required to choose a solution . in _ robust optimization _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we typically seek a solution minimizing the worst case behavior over all scenarios .",
    "hence the min - max and min - max regret criteria are widely applied .",
    "however , this approach to decision making is often regarded as too conservative or pessimistic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the min - max criterion takes into account only one , the worst - case scenario , ignoring the information connected with the remaining scenarios .",
    "this criterion also assumes that decision makers are very risk averse , which is not always true .    in this paper",
    "we wish to investigate a class of combinatorial optimization problems with the discrete uncertainty representation .",
    "hence , a scenario set provided with the input data , contains a finite number of explicitly given cost scenarios . in order to choose a solution we propose to use the _ ordered weighted averaging _ aggregation operator ( owa for short ) introduced by yager in  @xcite .",
    "the owa operator is widely applied to aggregate the criteria in multiobjective decision problems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but it can also be applied to choose a solution under the discrete uncertainty representation .",
    "it is enough to treat the cost of a given solution under @xmath1th scenario as a @xmath1th criterion .",
    "the key elements of the owa operator are weights whose number equals the number of scenarios .",
    "the @xmath1th weight expresses an importance of the @xmath1th largest cost of a given solution .",
    "hence , the weights allow a decision maker to take his attitude towards a risk into account and use the information about all scenarios while computing a solution .",
    "the owa operator generalizes the traditional criteria used in decision making under uncertainty such as the maximum , minimum , average , median , or hurwicz criterion .",
    "so , by using owa we can generalize the min - max approach , typically used in robust optimization .",
    "let us also point out that the owa operator is a special case of _ choquet integral _",
    ", a sophisticated tool for aggregating criteria in multiobjective decision problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the choquet integral has been recently applied to some multicriteria network problems in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the min - max combinatorial optimization problems are almost always harder to solve than their deterministic counterparts , even when the number of scenarios equals  2 . in particular , the min - max versions of the shortest path , minimum spanning tree , minimum assignment , minimum @xmath2 cut , and minimum selecting items problems are np - hard even for  2 scenarios  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the number of scenarios is a part of the input , then all these problems become strongly np - hard and hard to approximate within any constant factor  @xcite .",
    "since the maximum criterion is a special case of owa , the general problem of minimizing owa is not easier .",
    "however , it is not difficult to show that some other particular cases of owa , such as the minimum or average , lead to problems whose complexity is the same as the complexity of their deterministic counterparts .",
    "it is therefore of interest to provide a characterization of the problem complexity depending on various weight distributions .    in this paper",
    "we provide the following new results . in section  [ sec2scen ] , we study the case when the number of scenarios equals  2 .",
    "we give a characterization of the problem complexity depending on the weight distribution . in section  [ secfptas ] ,",
    "we show some sufficient conditions for the problem to admit a fully polynomial time approximation scheme ( fptas ) , when the number of scenarios is constant .",
    "finally , in section  [ secunb ] , we consider the case in which the number of scenarios is a part of the input .",
    "we discuss different types of weight distributions .",
    "we show that for nonincreasing weights ( i.e. when larger weights are assigned to larger solution costs ) and for the hurwicz criterion , the problem admits an approximation algorithm whose worst case ratio depends on the problem parameters , in particular on the number of scenarios . on the other hand",
    ", we show that if the weights are nondecreasing , or the owa criterion is median , then the problem is not at all approximable unless p = np .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite set of _ elements _ and @xmath4 be a set of _ feasible solutions_. in the deterministic case , each element @xmath5 has a nonnegative _ cost _ @xmath6 and we seek a solution whose total cost is minimum .",
    "namely , we wish to solve the following optimization problem : @xmath7 this formulation encompasses a large class of combinatorial optimization problems . in particular , for the class of network problems",
    "@xmath8 is the set of arcs of a given network @xmath9 and @xmath10 contains the subsets of the arcs forming , for example , @xmath2 paths , spanning trees , assignments , or @xmath2 cuts in @xmath11 . in practice ,",
    "problem  @xmath12 is often expressed as a 0 - 1 programming one , where binary variable @xmath13 is associated with each element  @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and a system of constraints describes the set @xmath10 in a compact form .",
    "before we discuss the uncertain version of problem @xmath12 , we recall the definition of the owa operator , proposed by yager in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be a vector of reals .",
    "let us introduce a vector @xmath17 such that @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 $ ] ( we use @xmath20 $ ] to denote the set @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a permutation of @xmath20 $ ] such that @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 } w_i f_{\\sigma(i)}.\\ ] ] the owa operator has several natural properties which easily follow from its definition ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . since it is a convex combination of @xmath26 it holds @xmath27 .",
    "it is also _ monotonic _ , i.e. if @xmath28 for all @xmath29 $ ] , then @xmath30 , _ idempotent _ , i.e. if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 and _ symmetric _ , i.e. its value does not depend on the order of the values @xmath26 .",
    "it generalizes several traditional criteria used in decision making under uncertainty and we will describe this fact later .",
    "assume that the costs in problem @xmath12 are uncertain and they are specified in the form of scenario set @xmath33 .",
    "hence @xmath34 contains @xmath0 distinct _ cost scenarios _ , where @xmath35 for @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the cost of a given solution  @xmath36 depends on scenario  @xmath37 and will be denoted by @xmath38 . in this paper",
    "we will aggregate the costs by using the owa operator .",

    "we will consider the following optimization problem : @xmath41    we now discuss several special cases of the min - owa  @xmath12 problem ( see also table  [ tabsc ] ) .",
    "if @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , then owa becomes the maximum and the corresponding problem is denoted as min - max  @xmath12 .",
    "this is a typical problem considered in the robust optimization framework .",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath43 for @xmath46 , then owa becomes the minimum and the corresponding problem is denoted as min - min  @xmath12 . in general ,",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath43 for @xmath29\\setminus\\{k\\}$ ] , then owa is the @xmath48-th largest cost and the problem is denoted as min - quant@xmath49  @xmath12 . in particular , when @xmath50 , then the @xmath48-th largest cost is median and the problem is denoted as min - median  @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath51 for all @xmath29 $ ] , i.e. when the weights are _ uniform _ , then owa is the average ( or the laplace criterion ) and the problem is denoted as min - average  @xmath12 .",
    "finally , if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for some fixed @xmath54 $ ] , and @xmath43 for the remaining weights , then we get the hurwicz pessimism - optimism criterion and the problem is then denoted as min - hurwicz  @xmath12 .",
    "our goal has been to provide general properties of min - owa  @xmath12 , which follow only from the type of the weight distribution in the owa operator .",
