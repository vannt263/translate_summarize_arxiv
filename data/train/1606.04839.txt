    "using highly controllable quantum devices to study other quantum systems , i.e. , quantum simulation  @xcite , offers a means to tackle strongly correlated fermion models that are intractable on classical computers .",
    "this is vital for understanding complex quantum materials  @xcite with strong electronic correlations that exhibit a plethora of exciting physical phenomena of immediate technological interest .",
    "examples of such effects include the mott metal - insulator transition  @xcite , colossal magnetoresistance  @xcite , and high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "classical numerical methods have limited ability to study even significantly simplified toy models of strongly correlated fermions .",
    "for instance , exact diagonalization faces exponential scaling with the system size , while quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite are often crippled by the infamous fermionic sign problem  @xcite .",
    "tensor network methods  @xcite are powerful in one spatial dimension where they track strong correlations accurately . however , in higher dimensional systems , correlations tend to grow more quickly with system size , making these methods computationally challenging .",
    "another well - established approach to the study of strongly correlated fermionic lattice systems is dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .",
    "it reduces the complexity of the original problem , e.g. , the hubbard model  @xcite _ in the thermodynamic limit _ , by mapping it onto a simpler impurity problem that is subject to a self - consistency condition relating its properties to those of the original model .",
    "since an impurity problem is local , the mapping corresponds to neglecting spatial fluctuations . in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions",
    "this mapping is exact , but for finite dimensions it is an approximation .",
    "nonetheless for lattice geometries with a large coordination number , self - consistently solving the impurity problem can yield an accurate approximate solution to the original hubbard problem .",
    "the ` impurity ' itself consists of a single lattice site taken from the original problem , and so inherits on - site interactions from the hubbard model .",
    "this impurity site is then immersed into a time - dependent , self - consistent mean - field with which it can dynamically exchange fermions .",
    "the mean - field thus attempts to model the rest of the lattice and by being dynamical can describe retardation phenomena .",
    "overall the impurity problem can be represented by a hamiltonian in which the interacting impurity site is coupled to a discrete set of non - interacting ` bath ' sites .",
    "the bath sites represent the mean - field and if there is an infinite number of them then the self - consistency condition is guaranteed to be satisfied",
    ". however , in practical implementations only a finite number of bath sites are used , which restricts the frequency resolution of the bath so self - consistency condition can only be fulfilled approximately . nevertheless , many strongly - correlated features , e.g. , the mott transition , are still be captured correctly  @xcite .    although dmft maps a hubbard model to an impurity model this is still a non - trivial quantum many - body problem to solve because of the interactions at the impurity site .",
    "it is usually solved by classical numerical methods , e.g. , specialised versions of those used to tackle the original problem , which attempt to keep track of the quantum correlations between impurity and bath sites .",
    "again this limits the number of bath sites that can be treated accurately .    here , we consider an alternative approach where the impurity problem is solved with a quantum simulator , thus avoiding many issues that are inherent to the classical methods .",
    "quantum simulation of fermionic models has so far been mostly restricted to the analogue paradigm , especially with ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "digital simulation approaches , akin to universal quantum simulators @xcite , have started to emerge in recent years , for example based on superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "the number of qubits in these digital simulators is , however , presently rather small .",
    "a direct implementation of the hubbard model would suffer from severe finite size effects .",
    "it is nevertheless still possible for a digital quantum simulator with a restricted number of qubits to describe fermionic models directly in the thermodynamic limit when the dmft approach is adopted .    to demonstrate this method we focus on the minimal incarnation of dmft , the so - called `` two - site '' dmft  @xcite , where the impurity model consists of one impurity site and only one bath site , both with local hilbert space dimension four , subjected to two specially chosen self - consistency conditions .",
    "since two - site dmft considers only the smallest possible impurity model , the approach can not match the accuracy of full dmft , but it can still give a _ qualitatively _ correct description of the infinite - dimensional hubbard model , and its simplicity makes it a good starting point before advancing to more accurate schemes .",
    "for explicit details of two - site dmft and its features compared to full dmft we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two - site system corresponds to four qubits , two for the impurity site and two for the bath site , while a fifth , ancillary qubit is used for measurements .",
    "this number of qubits is readily available in current digital quantum simulator platforms , with ibm having made a five - qubit quantum processor available to the public  @xcite .",
    "a nine - qubit processor has already been demonstrated in superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "trapped - ion technologies also allow for digital quantum simulations with up to six qubits  @xcite .",
    "being commensurate with current state - of - the - art technology is a further justification for studying this minimal model .",
    "our scheme is readily generalisable to a larger number of qubits allowing for more accurate simulations and potentially offering an exponential speed - up over classical hamiltonian - based dmft methods  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistency conditions are taken care of iteratively in a classical feedback loop , which thus completes the non - linear , hybrid quantum - classical device we introduce .",
    "dynamical mean - field simulations have already been proposed for such hybrid devices  @xcite .",
    "quantum gates similar to the ones needed in the two - site scheme have been used in demonstrating digital quantum simulation of fermionic models with superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "we thus focus on superconducting circuits as a candidate platform , although , e.g. , trapped ions  @xcite could also be considered .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : dmft ] , we further elucidate the framework of dmft applied to the hubbard model in infinite dimensions .",

    "the dmft approach  @xcite to solving this model consists in neglecting spatial fluctuations around a single lattice site and replacing the rest of the many - body lattice in the thermodynamic limit by a time - translation - invariant , self - consistent mean - field @xmath11 ( or @xmath19 in the frequency domain ) , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the dynamical mean - field approach reduces the complexity of the full hubbard model to an effective single - site system which is a slightly more benign many - body problem to solve . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "dmft becomes exact as the irreducible self - energy of the lattice model becomes strictly local in space , @xmath22 , and its skeleton diagrams agree with those of a single - site , or impurity , model  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the effective single - site , or impurity , problem also yields the solution of the infinite - dimensional hubbard model due to the self - consistency condition .",
