    "electronic materials whose low - energy excitations behave like dirac fermions attract a lot of interests in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "these materials are characterized by nodal points in the brillouin zone at which two distinct bands touch .",
    "examples of these materials range from graphene@xcite to the surface state of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators@xcite .",
    "these studies not only help in developing a new generation of electronic devices , but also provide a theoretical link between condensed matter theory and high energy physics .",
    "more recently , there has been growing interest in a close cousin of the above mentioned two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  the weyl semimetals ( wsm)@xcite . just like graphene , in these materials , two bands touch at certain point ( the weyl node ) in the momentum space . as usual , band touching usually leads to dirac fermions due to the presence of the time - reversal ( t ) and the space inversion ( p ) symmetry . to realize the weyl fermion , which has only half a degree of freedom of a single dirac fermion",
    ", the involved bands must be individually non - degenerate .",
    "this requires that either the t or the p symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "the stability of these weyl nodes are protected topologically .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that each weyl node carries a quantized monopole charge @xmath0 in the momentum space , which can not be changed by a small perturbation . moreover , since the net  magnetic charge \" must be zero in a brillouin zone , the weyl nodes have to appear in pairs in a crystal@xcite .",
    "since a wsm is a gapless system , it is expected that the electron - electron interaction should have dramatic impact on its properties . because of the vanishing density of states ( dos ) at the weyl nodes , the short - range interaction is perturbatively irrelevant@xcite while the long - range coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense@xcite .",
    "therefore , to the leading order , it is reasonable to ignore the short - range interaction and the low - energy properties of the wsm are captured by the free weyl fermions . while for the long - range coulomb interaction , we only expect logarithmic corrections to the physical response functions at low frequencies and long distances .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of strong electron - electron interactions , we expect a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) towards some symmetry breaking phases .",
    "previous studies based on the mean - field theory suggest that the possible states at strong repulsive interactions include the excitonic and the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase@xcite .",
    "later an unbiased pertuebative rg study on all possible four - fermion short - range repulsions that are consistent with the symmetries of the underlying lattice was performed@xcite . by extrapolating the one - loop rg equations to the strong - coupling regime , it was found that there is a unique direction in the asymptotic rg flow which points toward a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ground state with the characteristic momentum of the sdw state corresponding to the momentum separation between the two weyl nodes . very recently ,",
    "tackled this problem by mapping the lattice model with a strong on - site hubbard interaction to a @xmath1-@xmath2 type model . in terms of an appropriate mean - field treatment",
    ", it is concluded that the wsm with strong repulsions becomes magnetic - ordered .",
    "thus , both the perturbative rg and the strong - coupling analysis lead to a similar conclusion .",
    "since the wsm phase is stable at weak coupling and an ordered phase occurs at strong coupling , the two phases , the wsm and the ordered phase , must be separated by a quantum critical point ( qcp ) . up to now , it is still unclear what is the nature of this qcp .",
    "we try to answer it in this paper .",
    "we focus on the transition to sdw phase .",
    "we start with the minimal model of wsm which consists of two weyl nodes with opposite monopole charges .",
    "we propose that the critical theory is described by a single dirac fermion ( consisting of two copies of weyl fermions ) and a complex bosonic order parameter characterizing the sdw fluctuations . by a one - loop rg analysis",
    ", we find that the gaussian fixed is stable at low energies so that the correlation length exponent @xmath3 .",
    "although the qpt is characterized by a trivial fixed point in the sense that the boson - fermion coupling is marginally irrelevant , we find that the velocities of the fermionic quasiparticles and the magnetic excitations suffer from nontrivial renormalization effects .",
    "in fact , their ratio approaches one in the low - energy limit .",
    "this indicates that the qcp has an emergent lorentz symmetry , which results in the dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 .",
    "we also investigate the stability of the above fixed point in the presence of weak disorder .",
    "the latter is inevitable in condensed matter systems .",
    "the proposed critical theory has a chiral symmetry which is absent in the underlying lattice model . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we consider all sorts of disorder that are consistent with the chiral symmetry . in three dimensions ,",
    "there are four types of disorder satisfying this condition : the random chemical potential , the random vector potential , the random chiral chemical potential , and the random chiral vector potential .",
    "we find that while the critical properties of the clean system is stable against weak disorder for all types of the disorder mentioned above , a strong random chemical potential or a strong random vector potential may induce a quantum phase transition toward a disorder - dominated phase .",
    "the disorder physics for a single non - interacting dirac fermion is well - studied for the random chemical potential . already in the 1980 s , fradkin predicted the existence of a disorder - driven qpt from a semimetallic to a diffusive metallic ( dm ) phase with increasing disorder strength@xcite . with the renewed interest in the wsm ,",
    "further theoretical studies have been performed , including the global phase diagram of lattice models@xcite , the transport properties@xcite , the calculation of critical exponents@xcite , and the single - particle green function@xcite .",
    "recently , the role of the random vector potential in a non - interacting wsm has been examined@xcite , and a similar disorder - driven qpt from a semimetallic to a dm phase with increasing disorder strength is predicted .     and @xmath5 denote the disorder strength and the interaction strength , respectively . a denotes the qcp between the wsm and the dm phase , @xmath6 is the qcp between the wsm and the sdw phase , and c is a multicritical point .",
    "line @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to the second - order phase transition . at strong interaction and strong disorder strength",
    ", there are two possibilities : ( a ) an unknown phase lying between the dm and sdw phase and ( b ) a direct transition between the dm and sdw phase .",
    "the shape of the phase boundaries is nonuniversal . ]    since our analysis of the disorder effect is based on an effective theory of the interacting wsm , our work complements these previous works in the sense that our results are about the disorder effect on a wsm with _",
    "intermediate _ strength of electron - electron interactions . combined the knowledge on the disorder effects of a non - interacting wsm , we propose a global phase diagram of an interacting wsm in the presence of disorder at zero temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ wf1pf1 ] . at weak disorder strength and weak interacting strength ,",
    "the wsm phase is stable . by increasing the interacting strength ,",
    "the wsm becomes unstable and an ordered phase is developed . in our case , this strong - coupling phase exhibits the sdw ordering . on the other hand , for a weakly interacting wsm , a disorder - driven qpt occurs by increasing the disorder strength and the system turns into the dm phase at strong disorder . when both the disorder strength and the interaction strength are strong , there may be two possibilities : an unknown phase lying between the dm and the sdw phase ( fig .",

    ", there will be a multicritical point ( point c ) at which the wsm , the dm , and the sdw phase meet with each other .",

    "the last section is devoted to a conclusive discussion .",
    "we star with a minimal lattice model describing the non - interacting wsm whose bloch hamiltonian is given by@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 with @xmath11 are pauli matrices in the spin space and @xmath12 without loss of generality , we take @xmath13 .",

    "in terms of the low - energy degrees of freedom , one may expand the electron operator @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the operators with scaling dimensions higher than @xmath39 .",

    "we will focus on these types of random potentials .",
    "we will see later that these random potentials are divided into four classes : @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",

    "our work sheds some light on the global phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ wf1pf1 ] . at weak disorder strength and weak short - range repulsive interactions ,",
    "the wsm phase is stable . by increasing the disorder strength ,",
    "a qpt from the wsm to a disorder - dominated phase may occur for the random chemical potential , the random vector potential , or the random chiral chemical potential ( for @xmath188 ) by extrapolating our one - loop rg equations .",
    "for other types of disorder respecting the chiral symmetry , the wsm phase may be still stable for strong disorder strength .    on the other hand , by increasing the interaction strength , a qpt from the wsm phase to a symmetry - breaking phase ( the sdw phase in our case ) occurs .",
    "this qpt belongs to a non - gaussian universality class within the framework consisting only of the weyl fermions@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , according to our analysis , this qpt turns into a gaussian universality class by introducing the order - parameter fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the critical properties of this qcp are immune to weak disorder .    by increasing the disorder strength along the phase boundary between the wsm and the sdw phases",
    ", we expect the existence of a multicritical point at which the wsm , the dm , and the sdw phases meet each other .",
    "the nature of this multicritical point is not clear at this moment .",
    "based on the global topology of the phase diagram , there are two possibilities when both interaction and disorder strengths are strong : ( a ) the simplest scenario is that there is a direct continuous phase transition from the dm phase to the sdw phase .",
    "( b ) it is possible that there is an unknown intermediate phase existing between the dm and the sdw phase .",
    "the nature of this intermediate phase is unclear .",
    "however , it may be insulating due to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking by extrapolating our one - loop rg equations .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the transition between this phase and the dm phase should be a continuous one . to firmly answer whether the above speculations are true or",
    "not , one way is to find an effective field theory which addresses the critical properties of the multicritical point directly .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper , and much work remains to be done to clarify these issues .",

    "<S> although the low - energy and long - distance physics is governed by a free theory , the velocities of the fermionic quasiparticles and the magnetic excitations suffer from nontrivial renormalization effects . </S>",

    "<S> we further investigate the stability of the fixed point in the presence of weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while the fixed point is generally stable against weak disorder , among those disorders that are consistent with the emergent chiral symmetry of the clean system , a moderately strong random chemical potential and/or random vector potential may induce a quantum phase transition towards a disorder - dominated phase . </S>",
