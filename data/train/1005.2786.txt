    "we are mostly interested in situations where ( 1.1 ) represents a population dynamics model , or another biological model .",
    "typically , we want to obtain conditions for the existence of a travelling front connecting two steady - states , zero and a positive equilibrium @xmath17 . due to the biological interpretation of the model ,",
    "only non - negative solutions are meaningful , therefore we look for _ positive _ travelling wave solutions , connecting 0 to @xmath18 as @xmath19 goes from @xmath0 to @xmath20 .    with the method presented here ,",
    "such positive travelling waves are obtained for large wave speeds , as perturbations of a positive heteroclinic solution for the corresponding functional differential equation ( fde ) without diffusion , @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 denotes the function @xmath23 for @xmath24 $ ] ) , whose existence we shall prove under some requirements on @xmath25 .",
    "this idea is not original , and has been exploited in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . when compared with @xcite ,",
    "in the present paper the major novelty is that we give conditions for the travelling waves to be _",
    "positive_. we also note that @xcite considers delayed reaction - diffusion equations with a global space interaction , a situation not considered here , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "our results can however be extended easily , to take into account non - local effects . on the other hand , @xcite deals with _",
    "scalar _ reaction - diffusion equations with one single _",
    "discrete _ delay of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is @xmath29-smooth , @xmath30 for some @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . assuming that the two equilibria @xmath33 and @xmath18 are hyperbolic , under some further assumptions the existence of positive and in general non - monotone",
    "travelling wavefronts connecting 0 to @xmath18 was established in @xcite .",
    "recently , several techniques have been developed to prove the existence of travelling wave fronts for delayed diffusion equations .",
    "they are often based on the application of a fixed point theorem in an adequate banach space , which requires a _ quasi - monotonicity _ condition , either for the original equation ( [ e1.3 ] ) @xcite or , more recently , for some auxiliary equations @xcite .",
    "these methods are usually combined with a monotonic iteration scheme , associated with the construction of a pair of upper and lower solutions .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we emphasize that our method applies to systems ( [ e1.1 ] ) with non - monotone nonlinearities , in the sense that we do not impose on @xmath25 any type of quasi - monotonicity condition , as defined in @xcite .    before introducing our hypotheses , we set some standard notation . for @xmath34",

    "an existence result of travelling waves connecting two hyperbolic equilibria was already obtained in @xcite , for a class of reaction - diffusion equations with global response , but for such waves no exponential decay at @xmath0 was derived in @xcite , nor their positiveness . by a careful analysis of the behaviour of the wave profiles at @xmath0 , in section 4",
    "we prove that there are _ positive _ travelling waves if the wave speed is large enough , and explicitly give their asymptotic decay at @xmath0 .",
