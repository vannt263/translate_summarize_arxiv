    "increasing the shaking amplitude was not possible for us due to the limitations of our shaking coil .",
    "however , we were able to increase the main magnetic field to @xmath92 t . the effectiveness of the shaking field increases with increasing main magnetic field , because the pinning strength decreases with increasing magnetic field as can be seen from the hysteresis in the magnetization loops of nb@xmath2sn ( see refs .",

    "strikingly , for a large shaking - field amplitude @xmath94mt ( green curve ) the dome - like feature diminishes and for the largest amplitude @xmath95mt ( purple curve ) the dome - like feature even vanishes completely . if the dome - like feature origins from a first - order vortex - lattice melting transition , this vanishing for high shaking - filed amplitudes @xmath12 would be unexpected .",
    "however , in the picture of our interpretation where the dome - like feature is a manifestation of the increased pinning strength in the peak - effect region , the vanishing of the dome - like feature with increasing @xmath12 is expected .",

    "we plotted data for a measurement on increasing the temperature and for a measurement on decreasing the temperature .",
    "strikingly , a similar self - heating pattern emerges for both measurements in the peak - effect region .",
    "if the dome - like feature would have been due to a first - order melting transition , the related latent heat should have been released in one measurement and absorbed in the other measurement .",
    "however , we observe for both measurements a dome - like feature where the sample gets colder .",
    "the occurrence of self heating is rather cumbersome when it comes to the identification of phase transitions .",
    "the broad and huge shape of the dome - like feature already disqualify it as a manifestation of a melting transition to some degree .",

    "+    , width=283 ]    finally , we want to report on the influence of the cooling rate during the fc procedure on the self - heating pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig.prb_2012_comparison_slow_fast_pdf ] we plotted two measurements at @xmath101 t , @xmath73hz , and @xmath102mt .",
    "for the green curve we used the usual slow cooled fc procedure and the usual sharp step - like onset of the self heating occurs in the data , which we marked with a green arrow . for the red curve we used a very high cooling rate by the use of a cooling clamp which connected the measuring cell directly with the cold insert .",
    "it appears as if the formerly very sharp step - like onset of self heating turned into a smeared kink , which we marked with a red arrow in the figure .",
    "the faster cooling lead to a fast passing of the peak - effect region , giving the vortex lattice not enough time to adjust to the strongest pinning centers while the vortex lattice is easy bendable in the peak - effect region where the shear modulus is reduced .",
    "the ordered weakly pinned vortex lattice gets quenched , it has not enough time to pick up much disorder and strong pinning before it becomes rigid at low temperatures where it can not adjust to the strongest pinning centers anymore . on heating up the sample again during the measurement , the less strong pinned vortex lattice allows the shaking field already at lower temperatures to cause vortex motion .",
    "the broadening of the onset may be caused by the circumstance that some parts of the sample are stronger pinned than others for the fast cooled fc procedure . in contrast , for the slow cooled fc procedure the sample stays for a long enough time in the peak - effect region on cooling the sample , allowing the vortices throughout the whole sample to adjust to the strongest pinning centers , which leads to a homogeneous strong pinning throughout the whole sample and as a result to the sharper self - heating onset at higher temperatures on shaking during the measurement .",
    "+ this finding is likely not a new one .",
    "however , we want to mention its practical relevance .",
    "it appears to be beneficial to cool down type - ii superconductors very slowly across their peak - effect region ( if present ) in the presence of a magnetic field , in order to achieve ( freeze in ) the strongest pinned and most homogeneous phase throughout the whole superconductor .",
    "to conclude , we confirm the observation of the fluctuation peak in the specific heat of nb@xmath2sn near @xmath7 , which was previously reported by lortz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the same crystal . along with work done by other authors our data",
    "support the view that thermal fluctuations manifest not only in high-@xmath1 superconductors but also in low-@xmath1 superconductors like nb@xmath2sn @xcite , nb @xcite , and dirty bi@xmath103sb@xmath104 films @xcite .",

    "@xcite indicated position in the magnetic phase diagram in any of our measurements .",
    "we want to point out that our data at @xmath56 t and even some of our data at @xmath59 t are virtually free of self heating and still we do not observe any sign of a vortex melting .",
    "the by us observed broad dome - like feature in the measurements at higher magnetic fields where self heating is present , is interpreted by us as a manifestation of the increased pinning in the peak - effect region .",
    "we want to emphasize again that the discrepancy between the data of lortz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and our data presented in this work may originate from the different specific - heat methods and different shaking methods and parameters used by the two groups .",
