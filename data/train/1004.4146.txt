    "@xcite , bell inequalities found a new dimension with the work of john bell who showed that quantum physics could violate these conditions in some situations , highlighting what is now known as quantum nonlocality @xcite .",
    "complete set of bell inequalities are known only for setups involving small numbers of parties , measurement settings , and measurement outcomes .",
    "this may already be sufficient for various applications , such as exhibiting the nonlocality of a noisy quantum state in a real experiment @xcite , or establishing the security of a device - independent quantum key distribution protocol @xcite .",
    "but the simplest inequalities are not always optimal . for instance , certain inequalities with large number of measurement settings are much more resistant to the detection inefficiencies than the chsh inequality @xcite , or are violated by quantum states that do not violate the chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "this motivates a search for bell inequalities involving more parties , measurements , or outcomes . but",
    "finding all bell inequalities pertaining to a given experimental setup is in general a hard task @xcite , and a complete search with current - day techniques is not feasible in most instances .",
    "it is instructive , however , to realize that many useful bell inequalities , like chsh @xcite , mermin @xcite or cglmp @xcite to cite just a few , can be written in a form that is invariant under any permutation of the parties .",
    "symmetric inequalities are also attractive because they are likely to be easier to handle . motivated by this observation , we show here how to exploit a symmetric version of the full bell polytope to generate all symmetric bell inequalities .",
    "this symmetrized polytope is much easier to handle than the full bell polytope . in particular , for bell experiment with binary settings and outcomes , the number of extremal points of the symmetrized polytope only grows polynomially with the number of parties , which is an exponential gain compared to the general situation .",
    "our method for finding symmetric inequalities is not restricted to bell inequalities , but can be applied to any set of inequalities characterizing a correlation polytope , like for instance the svetlichny inequalities , which allow to test for genuinely multipartite nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "we present in the next section our approach from this general perspective .",
    "we then apply in section  3 our method to several examples for which listing all ( non - symmetric ) inequalities is computationally intractable with present - day techniques . in the bell scenario with two parties , two settings , and four outcomes , we find in particular facet inequalities that are not of the cglmp form , answering an open question raised by gill  @xcite .",
    "let ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) denote a bell experiment where @xmath2 parties can choose one out of @xmath3 possible measurement settings that each yield one out of @xmath4 possible outcomes and outcomes @xmath5 for each party  @xmath6 are also possible , but since we will consider situations that are symmetric under permutations of the parties , we choose @xmath7 , @xmath8 for all @xmath6 . ] .",
    "the statistics of the observed results are described by the joint conditional probability distributions ( also called correlations . ] ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the measurement setting of party @xmath6 and @xmath11 denotes the corresponding measurement result .",
    "note that in general the @xmath12 probabilities ( [ eq : p ] ) are not all independent but satisfy linear constraints , such as the normalization conditions or the no - signalling conditions .",
    "we are thus actually interested in an affine subspace of @xmath13 of dimension @xmath14 , where @xmath15 for normalized correlations , and @xmath16 for correlations that satisfy in addition the no - signalling conditions @xcite .",

    "a polytope can be described by the list @xmath21 of its vertices ( or extremal points ) @xmath22 , and any point @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 are positive and normalized weights : @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the case of the bell polytope , for instance , the extremal points are the deterministic local strategies , corresponding to the prior assignment of an outcome @xmath29 to each measurement setting @xmath30",

    "a half - space is defined by an inequality @xmath34 specified by the couple @xmath35 .",
    "we say that an inequality @xmath36 is valid for the polytope @xmath20 , if @xmath37 for all points @xmath17 in @xmath20 .",

    "that is , a point @xmath17 belongs to @xmath20 if and only  if [ hs ] hph_0 ( h , h_0)h , where @xmath33 is some finite set in @xmath38 .",
    "this description is particularly appropriate when willing to show that a point does not belong to the polytope , since it is sufficient to exhibit the violation of a single one of the inequalities ( [ hs ] ) . in the case of the bell polytope",
    ", these inequalities are known as bell inequalities .",
    "a complete and minimal representation of a polytope in the form ( [ hs ] ) is provided by the set of facets of the polytope .",

    "the set @xmath42 then corresponds to the facet defined by @xmath43 .",
    "finding all the bell inequalities corresponding to an experimental configuration @xmath44 thus amounts to determining the facets ( minimal h - representation ) of a polytope when given its extremal points ( v - representation ) .",
    "this conversion problem is well known and there exists several available algorithms to solve it @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 are too large , the associated polytope becomes too complex to be handled by these algorithms . it might then be appropriate to focus the search on a subclass of all facet inequalities .",
    "we explain how this can be done for symmetric inequalities in the next section .",
    "some facet inequalities @xmath43 of a correlation polytope @xmath20 can be written in a way that is invariant under permutations of the parties .",

    "note that the correlation polytopes that we consider here are evidently invariant under such permutations , i.e. , @xmath58 , and any vertex @xmath59 is mapped into another vertex @xmath60 .    given a facet - inequality @xmath43 of @xmath20 ,",
    "let @xmath61 be its image under @xmath57 .",

    "we thus have reduced the original 8-dimensional polytope defined by 16 vertices to a 5-dimensional polytope with 10 vertices . applying to this symmetrized polytope a standard algorithm performing the transformation from the v - representation to the h - representation , we find 4 different types ( up to relabeling of settings and outcomes ) of facets of the symmetric polytope : @xmath148 we recognize the first inequality as the positivity condition for the joint probabilities and the last one as the chsh inequality ( written in the ch form as in equation ) .",

    "9 of them involve only full ( 5-partite ) correlators and were already given in @xcite .",

    "when dealing with bell inequalities , it is useful to check quickly if two inequalities are equivalent under relabeling of parties , measurement settings , or outcomes .",
    "we were confronted with this problem when classifying the inequalities that we derived here . in this appendix",
    ", we introduce a parametrization of the correlation space which naturally induces several invariants for each equivalence class .",
    "two inequalities that are equivalent have equal invariants .",
    "let us consider a @xmath44 bell scenario and let @xmath195 be a subset of the @xmath2 parties .",
    "define @xmath196 as the probability that these @xmath197 parties obtain outputs @xmath198 given that measurements @xmath199 have been made on all parties .",
    "note that with this notation , the no - signalling condition is expressed as @xmath200 , where @xmath201 .",
    "define now single - party  correlators \" @xmath202 by @xmath203 and define by induction multipartite correlators @xmath204 through @xmath205 where the @xmath206 operation is just the usual multiplication , except when acting on two probabilities , in which case it satisfies @xmath207 .",
    "the no - signalling condition is then expressed as e(a_i|x)=e(a_i|x_i ) .",
    "the normalization condition on the probabilities @xmath196 imply , on the other hand , that for any @xmath208 @xmath209*e(a_{i\\backslash i}|x)=0\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    the correlators @xmath204 are in one - to - one correspondence with the probabilities @xmath196 and thus represent an alternative parametrization of the correlation space .",
    "note that in the case of binary outcomes ( @xmath210 ) , @xmath211 coincides with the usual definition of a correlation function .",
    "the definitions and thus represent a possible generalisation of correlation function to more outcomes .    with the notation that we just introduced , a generic bell inequality in the no - signalling space takes the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 are the coefficients of the inequality .",
    "a property of the correlators @xmath211 is that the white noise yields @xmath214 . the resistance to noise of a an inequality written in the form ( [ incor ] )",
    "is thus directly given by the ratio of the local bound to the violation .",
    "a relabeling of parties , measurement settings , or measurement outcomes simply amounts to rearrange the order of the coefficients of the inequality .",
    "note , however , that because of the normalization conditions ( [ eq : normalisation ] ) , the basis of the correlation space that we chose is overcomplete . the coefficients @xmath213 are thus not uniquely defined : adding @xmath215 for some @xmath208 to the inequality ( [ incor ] ) does not change the inequality itself , but does change its coefficients . to compare two inequalities",
    ", we must therefore ensure first that they are written in some standard way .",
    "the freedom that we have in adding terms of the form @xmath216 to ( [ incor ] ) corresponds to define new coefficients for the inequality in the following manner [ eq : cprime ] c(a_i , x_i)= c(a_i , x_i ) + _ ii ( i , a_ii , x_i ) .",
    "we show now that requiring the inequality coefficients @xmath217 to satisfy the relation @xmath218 allows to define them uniquely .",
    "there exist values of @xmath219 such that the newly defined coefficients @xmath217 satisfy relation .",
    "moreover for all such @xmath220 s , the @xmath217 are the same , they are thus unique .    since equations and apply independently on every subset @xmath221 of the parties , and on every inputs @xmath222 , we omit these indices , writing for instance @xmath223 instead of @xmath213 to lighten the notation .",
    "moreover , all sums on the outputs @xmath224 go from @xmath225 to @xmath226 and all sums on the parties @xmath6 run on @xmath221 , so we also omit these bounds in the proof .    the existence of the @xmath220 s can be shown by directly checking that the following formula is of the form , and satisfies .",
    "let @xmath227c(a_i)\\ ] ] where we used the notation @xmath228f$ ] for any function @xmath123 and the @xmath229 composition satisfies @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 and distributes over addition . to get this expression from one possible choice of lambdas",
    "is : @xmath233 and equation is satisfied : @xmath234c(a_i)\\\\ & = \\left[\\ldots\\circ\\left(\\sum_{a_i } - \\sum_{a_i}\\right)\\circ\\ldots\\right]c(a_i)=0 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    now to show the unicity of the @xmath235 coefficients , we notice that equation is a non - homogeneous linear system of equations in the @xmath220 variables , which we can write as : @xmath236 every solution of this system can thus be written as @xmath237 where @xmath238 is a particular solution of the equation ( as given by equation for instance ) and @xmath239 is a solution of the homogeneous system , where the right - hand side of equation is replaced by zero .",
    "thus every @xmath240 that satisfies equation can be written as @xmath241    now we show that the last term of equation is zero for every solution @xmath239 of the homogeneous counterpart of system , which implies that the coefficients @xmath235 are uniquely defined .",
    "for this , consider the following expression : @xmath242\\lambda_v(i , a_{i\\setminus i}).\\ ] ] it is clearly zero , since it contains the term @xmath243\\lambda_v(i , a_{i\\setminus i})=\\lambda_v(i , a_{i\\setminus i})-\\frac1k k \\lambda_v(i , a_{i\\setminus i})=0.\\ ] ] on the other hand , we have that @xmath244\\sum_i\\lambda_v(i , a_{i\\setminus i})\\\\ & = \\left[\\left({\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1}}-\\frac1k\\sum_{a_1}\\right)\\circ\\ldots\\circ\\left({\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1}}-\\frac1k\\sum_{a_{n-1}}\\right)\\right]\\sum_i\\lambda_v(i , a_{i\\setminus i})\\nonumber\\\\ & \\ \\",

    "we showed that the coefficients of an inequality can be defined in a standard and unique way by requiring them to satisfy the constraints ( [ eq : conditioncoeffs ] ) .",
    "now , since a relabeling of parties , measurement settings , or outcomes can only rearrange the coefficients @xmath217 without changing their value , the ordered lists of coefficients @xmath217 for @xmath248 provide @xmath249 invariants for each equivalence class .",
    "for instance the local bound @xmath250 is an ( easily checkable ) invariant . in general requiring that two inequalities have their ordered list of coefficients identical does not guarantee that they are equivalent , but in the symmetric @xmath251 scenario for instance , all the @xmath252 classes of inequalities that we generated had different lists .",
    "the following inequalities are given in the notation of @xcite .",
