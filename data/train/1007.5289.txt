    "damped nonlinear classical oscillators can display rather nontrivial features when they are modulated by an external time - dependent driving force @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is the classical duffing oscillator , for which a quartic nonlinearity extends the harmonic potential such that the static potential still remains monostable . adding a periodic modulation generates several dynamical stable states and the role of environmental fluctuating forces becomes particularly intriguing at the bifurcation points @xcite .",
    "close to the fundamental resonance , the classical duffing oscillator displays two stable states of large and small oscillation amplitudes .",
    "environmental fluctuations can induce transitions between the two states and the scaling property of the probability of an activated escape from such a metastable state near the bifurcation point can be determined @xcite .    for the corresponding quantum duffing oscillator , two inherently quantum mechanical effects can contribute to the escape from the metastable forced state over the effective quasienergy barrier .",
    "one mechanism is dynamical tunneling @xcite in the quasienergy surface , which leads at low temperatures to a sharp increase of the transition probabilities near the classical bifurcation point ( determined in the quasiclassical approximation ) . in addition",
    ", quantum activation @xcite occurs which even at zero temperature leads to an effective diffusion over the quasienergy barrier induced by the environmental quantum fluctuations . at a first instance",
    ", this effect might appear somewhat counterintuitive , but one has to bear in mind that energy absorption in the environment can increase the system s quasienergy , this quantity being defined in a rotating frame .",
    "it has been shown that the escape is always over the barrier ( of activation type ) , provided that the broadening of the quasienergy levels , induced by the environment , exceeds the corresponding coherent tunneling rate@xcite .",
    "other driven nonlinear quantum systems , such as the parametrically driven duffing oscillator @xcite or modulated large - spin systems @xcite show quantum activated behavior as well . in this regime",
    ", there is a separation of time scales .",
    "after the fast intrawell relaxation processes have occured , the system occupies a quasiclassical state , which is metastable . from this",
    ", it can escape by rare interwell transitions that eventually would lead to the other metastable state .",
    "in the opposite limit , when tunneling transitions noticeably contribute , the separation of time scales is not well defined and a mixture of all quasienergy states forms the stationary state .",
    "this is the case when a coherent resonant excitation induces a population of a multiphoton quasienergy state , as shown for the duffing oscillator @xcite .",
    "since the quasienergy states oscillate with different phases with respect to the external modulation , a resonant or antiresonant response of the oscillator to the modulation may occur at a multiphoton transition .",
    "which type arises , is determined by the dominant stationary population of the involved quasienergy state and thus depends also on the parameters of the environment .",
    "these lineshape properties around a multiphoton ( anti-)resonance are connected with a resonantly enhanced escape in form of resonant dynamical tunneling @xcite , which shows up as resonant tunneling peak in the switching rate .",
    "enhanced peaks are associated with resonant line shapes , while reduced peaks go with an antiresonance .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that a dynamical bistability also occurs in the setup of a driven linear resonator coupled to a quantum two - level system ( driven circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) set - up ) .",
    "the system is conveniently modeled by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite which is extended by a driving term .",
    "the static jaynes - cummings model was originally studied to describe the interaction of a two - level atom and a single quantized electromagnetic field mode and has an inherent nonlinearity since the splitting of the vacuum rabi resonance depends on the number @xmath0 of photons in the resonator as @xmath1 .",
    "already its undriven dynamics has many interesting facets , including rabi oscillations , collapses and revivals of quantum states , quantum squeezing , quantum entanglement , schrdinger cat and fock states , and photon antibunching @xcite",
    ". it also finds applications beyond quantum optical set - ups , namely in nanocircuit architectures , such as cooper pair boxes @xcite , superconducting flux qubits @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , and semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter setups allow to explore the regime of strong qubit - resonator coupling as the resonator is typically formed by a nanoscale on - chip transmission line .",
    "in addition , strong driving allows to access the regime of nonlinear response .",
    "these experiments based on quantum state engineering with superconducting circuits were accompanied by progress in theory , based on the adoption of the undriven jc model @xcite to the particular experimental situations .",
    "in addition , the model has been extended by an additional time - dependent modulation term @xcite , mimicking the effect of rf fields applied either to the qubit or to the oscillator part .",
    "the more general case of @xmath0 two - level atoms strongly coupled to a driven optical cavity has been considered in ref .   for the case of weak driving fields and non - classical features in the photon correlation function",
    "have been identified .",
    "the driven jaynes - cummings model has recently found an experimental realization in form of a superconducting transmon qubit device @xcite .",
    "the transmitted heterodyne signal has been used as a measure of the amplitude of the stationary oscillations of the oscillator position .",
    "it has allowed to study for the first time the supersplitting of each vacuum rabi peak which reflects transitions between the groundstate and the first / the second excited state of the undriven jaynes - cummings spectrum .",
    "their energy difference is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the interaction strength of the qubit and the harmonic mode .",
    "in addition , for stronger driving , the excitation of discrete multiphoton transitions up to a photon number of @xmath4 has been observed .",
    "the measurements have been analyzed by accurate numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "an effective two - level approach which involves the vacuum and the one - photon dressed state has been used to describe the vacuum rabi splitting @xcite .",
    "moreover , the characteristic @xmath5 spacing of the involved energy levels has been demonstrated . at resonance ,",
    "the system is coherently excited to a @xmath6photon state .",
    "the relaxation occurs via subsequent dissipative transitions , generating eventually a steady state which involves a mixture of many quantum states and which renders a two - level description inappropriate .    in this paper",
    ", we complement our brief account of ref .   by a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the driven jaynes - cummings model in the deep quantum regime of few photons in the resonator .",
    "motivated by the failure of perturbation theory for arbitrary small intensity of the driving , we carry on an alternative approach . the transformation to the frame rotating with the frequency of the external driving yields to a description in terms of quasienergy levels and states .",
    "discrete multiphoton transitions arise at avoided quasisenergy level crossings .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the hamiltonian in the dressed state basis in form of two quasienergy surfaces , one of which shows bistability . this description allows to interpret the multiphoton transitions as tunneling transitions in the bistable quasienergy surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the region of the spectrum for which perturbation theory fails can be studied by means of a harmonic expansion of the quasienergy surface around its global minimum . as already mentioned in ref .",
    ", the lowest quasienergy state is a quantum squeezed state with the squeezing parameter being a function of the ratio of qubit - oscillator coupling and driving strength . in turn , this state of lowest quasienergy has sub - poissonian statistics . to complete the picture , we present the analysis of the corresponding dissipative dynamics for the cases when both the qubit and the oscillator are damped . in presence of resonant multiphoton transitions , the interplay of tunneling and",
    "dissipation results in a stationary state which consists of a statistical mixture of several quasienergy states .",
    "together with the levels involved in the respective multiphoton / tunneling transition , also the levels around the global minimum may have a large weight in the mixture .",
    "we show that the stationary occupation probability of the state with lowest quasienergy governs the lineshape of the nonlinear response yielding to resonant or antiresonant characteristics .",
    "as opposed to other anharmonic oscillators , the activation out of the global minimum is not dominantly triggered by quantum activation @xcite , but instead by dissipative spin - flips ( i.e. , transitions between the two quasienergy surfaces ) . for purcell - limited devices and away from a multiphoton transition , this is the slowest dissipative process and the corresponding rate can be computed by diagonalizing the liouville operator numerically .",
    "finally , we discuss the generic features of damped driven nonlinear oscillators in the deep quantum regime .",
    "we consider a state - of - the - art circuit @xcite or optical @xcite cavity qed set up in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the cavity is driven by an external periodically time - dependent field .",
    "we note that this naturally implies the coupling to external modes which intrinsically renders the atom - cavity system an open quantum system .",
    "however , the strong coupling regime is characterized by an atom - cavity coupling which dominates over all dissipative processes . in this limit ,",
    "intrinsically coherent phenomena play a crucial role and the dissipative processes can be considered as small perturbation .",
    "hence , in order to lay the basis for the weakly damped , dissipative dynamics , we first focus on the coherent dynamics of the atom - cavity system .",
    "this paves the way to the full analysis of the open system which will be carried out in section [ sec.dissdyn ] .",
    "hence , at this stage it is not necessary to restrict ourself to a specific configuration , e.g. , a one- vs.   a two - sided cavity or an circuit vs.  an optical cavity .",
    "we model the cavity as an harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath7 which is characterized by the the ladder operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 and which is coupled with strength @xmath3 to a qubit , modeling an ( artificial ) atom with two only relevant quantum states , with equal resonant frequency .",
    "the qubit is described in terms of the pauli operators @xmath10 and the oscillator is modulated by a ( classical ) time - dependent field with frequency @xmath11 and field strength @xmath12 .",
    "the total hamiltonian thus reads ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 in the frame rotating with @xmath11 and for the detuning @xmath15 , we perform a rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite and obtain the hamiltonian of the driven jc model as @xmath16 with @xmath17 . formally , the undriven jc model has the quasienergies ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 which follow from diagonalization of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamrwa ] ) for @xmath20 .",
    "the quasienergy states can be expressed in the product basis of oscillator eigenstates @xmath21 and qubit eigenstates @xmath22 as @xmath23 we will refer to the two latter as dressed @xmath24-photon or fock states with two spin directions @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26photon quasienergy level crosses the @xmath0-photon level at @xmath27 ( for spin @xmath28 respectively ) . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the crossings turn into avoided crossings .",
    "at such an anticrossing , the zero - photon state @xmath30 and the @xmath0-photon dressed state @xmath31 display rabi oscillations with the rabi frequency @xmath32 given by the minimal splitting of the two quasienergy levels .",
    "these rabi oscillations represent the @xmath0-photon transitions . in order to have well separated resonances , we consider here the strong coupling regime @xmath33 .",
    "there , one would naively expect that standard perturbation theory in the driving @xmath12 ( and its generalization to quasidegenerate levels at resonance ) would yield a correct description of all the quasienergy states which are relevant in the low energy dissipative dynamics considered in section [ sec.dissdyn ] .",

    "the zero - photon quasienergy state is no longer stable since excitations to a @xmath6photon state occur .",
    "hence , it becomes metastable and generates a ( anti-)resonance of the stationary oscillation .",
    "this behavior of the quantum duffing oscillator has been already predicted @xcite , but the link to the semiclassical picture @xcite has not been drawn .",
    "thus , the generic behavior of a driven damped nonlinear quantum oscillator includes dynamically generated metastable states from which the system can escape via thermal diffusion , quantum activation or dynamical tunneling . in the regime of many photons in the resonator",
    ", the escape rate of dynamical tunneling processes can be obtained in a semiclassical description , while in the regime of only few photons ( deep quantum regime ) , the escape can occur via resonant dynamical tunneling , leading to resonant multiphoton transitions . depending on the ratio of the rabi frequency and the lifetime of the multiphoton state",
    ", the resonant dynamical tunneling can be coherent ( for large quality factors ) or incoherent ( for small quality factors ) .",
    "depending on the phase of the associated multiphoton transitions , a resonant or an antiresonant nonlinear response may arise .",
    "such a situation is also expected in a josephson bifurcation amplifier @xcite operated in the deep quantum regime ( note that all related experimental setups realized so far operate in the classical regime ) .",
    "in conclusion , inspired by recent experiments , we have shown that a driven circuit qed setup can acquire a dynamical bistability .",
    "the relevant model to describe this is the driven dissipative jaynes - cummings model for which we have analyzed its nonlinear response properties .",
    "we have shown that a quasienergy surface can be derived in a rotating frame picture which clearly shows two metastable basins of attraction .",
    "this picture is also convenient for studying the semiclassical limit .",
    "we have predicted the existence of a metastable quantum squeezed state in the semiclassical limit and have discussed a connection between effective local temperature at the bottom of the quasienergy well and the squeezing parameter .",
    "we have analyzed the escape mechanisms from the metastable states and found resonant dynamical tunneling , both in an incoherent and a coherent version .",
    "our analysis adds another example to the series of nonlinear driven dissipative quantum systems with surprising and counterintuitive , but generic features .",
    "the thorough experimental investigation of these intrinsic quantum effects is an interesting prospect ."
