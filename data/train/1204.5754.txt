    "stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) are an important source of dust injected into the interstellar medium in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how important they are in more metal - poor environments is an open question , with consequences for the early history of the milky way , current conditions in other smaller local group galaxies , and even for galaxies in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite has made it possible to explore this question by observing the dust forming around individual evolved stars in environments spanning a range of metallicities , both in our own galaxy and elsewhere in the local group .",

    "* ) , small magellanic cloud ( smc ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , fornax dwarf spheroidal @xcite , sagittarius dwarf spheroidal @xcite , sculptor dwarf spheroidal @xcite , and several galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "these metalliticies of these systems span a range of @xmath02.1 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.0 .",
    "comparisons of these samples with each other and with samples from the galactic disk reveal that the amount of dust produced around oxygen - rich agb stars decreases in more metal - poor environments @xcite , but for carbon - rich agb stars , the amount of dust observed shows no measurable dependence on metallicity @xcite .",
    "stars on the agb will produce either carbon - dominated or oxygen - dominated dust , depending on their dredge - up histories and initial abundances .",
    "agb stars generate carbon via the triple - alpha sequence @xcite in a helium - burning shell around an inert c / o core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the helium fusion proceeds in a series of thermal pulses in the interior , leading to pulses of convection which dredge newly produced carbon up to the surface .",
    "the dredge - ups can raise the photospheric c / o ratio above unity , converting an agb star with a spectral class of m giant to a carbon star .",
    "the envelopes of agb stars are unstable to pulsations with typical periods of hundreds of days , making them readily identifiable as long - period variables ( lpvs ) .",
    "these pulsations in the envelopes may even drive the mass - loss process ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the formation of co in the resulting outflows will exhaust all of the available carbon or oxygen , whichever is less abundant , leading to a chemical dichotomy in the dust which will condense out of the outflowing gas .",
    "alumina and silicates will dominate the shells around m giants , and amorphous carbon will dominate the shells around carbon stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in more metal - poor galaxies , stars of lower initial mass will become carbon stars on the agb .",
    "counts of carbon stars in the lmc and smc reveal this fact observationally @xcite , and it is expected theoretically @xcite . a recent infrared census of the smc with _ spitzer _ reveals the consequence : carbon stars produce more dust than their oxygen - rich agb counterparts or red supergiants @xcite , possibly much more @xcite .",
    "the smc serves as a proxy for metal - poor galaxies too distant for their constituent stars to be studied individually . by studying even more metal - poor galaxies in the local group",
    ", we can push to even more primitive systems .",
    "the infrared spectra of seven carbon stars beyond the magellanic clouds have been published so far , six in fornax @xcite , and one in sculptor @xcite .",
    "this paper presents spectra from the irs for a larger sample of carbon stars in these two galaxies , as well as the carina and leo  i dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies .",
    "the stars in the sample are quite faint in the infrared , and the development of a new algorithm to extract spectra from the two - dimensional irs images @xcite makes it possible to analyze their spectra similarly to closer and brighter samples . additionally , near - infrared ( nir ) monitoring from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao )",
    "has provided information on the pulsation modes and periods of the targeted stars which was not available when _ spitzer _ observed them .",
    "these two improvements give us the opportunity to extend the previous comparisons of mass loss and dust production in evolved stars to more distant galaxies with lower metallicities .",
    "section 2 presents our targeted galaxies , with an emphasis on their distances and metallicities , and explains how we selected our sample of stars .",
    "section 3 describes the observations and data reduction . in section 4 , we determine bolometric magnitudes and use these to re - assess the metallicities .",
    "section 5 presents the spectroscopic results , and section 6 discusses the consequences of our findings .",

    "the three carbon stars in leo  i are probably younger than @xmath37  m@xmath26 , but their relatively unconstrained masses allow us to say little more about their age .",
    "fortunately for our efforts to constrain their metallicity , the mdf for leo  i is narrow ( @xmath1[fe / h]@xmath8 = @xmath01.35 @xmath2 0.24 , see   [ s.metal ] ) .",
    "no matter their mass and age , these stars are likely to be more metal - poor than those in fornax and even sculptor .",

    "similarly , while @xcite suggested that mag  29 , which is also associated with significant quantities of carbon - rich dust , would have formed with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath01.4 , we have revised this metallicity up to @xmath3@xmath01.0 .",

    "one alternative explanation is that this spectrum is affected by strong c@xmath37 absorption at 10  , which would push our continuum fit downward and enhance the apparent strength of the sic emission .",
    "the most surprising result of this study is that the carbon stars in sculptor and leo  i seem to have less dust around them than their counterparts in more metal - rich galaxies .",
    "previous studies of carbon stars in the galaxy , the lmc , and the smc showed that the amount of circumstellar dust , as measured by the [ 6.4]@xmath0[9.3 ] color , followed the same relationship with pulsation period of the star , despite their differences in metallicity .",

    "metallicity also does not work , even though we expect a fairly broad range of metallicities within each of the milky way , lmc , and smc . if metallicity were responsible",

    "the dust content depends primarily on the abundance of c , which it produces via the 3-@xmath41 sequence and dredges to its surface .",
    "the free carbon available for dust production depends on what remains after co consumes the available oxygen , so that @xmath42 in this equation and the ones that follow , `` c '' and `` o '' are the fractional abundances of carbon and oxygen , by number",

    "it is instructive to consider the example of the smc . despite the fact that stars in the smc form with only 20% of the carbon in their galactic counterparts , if they dredge up the same amount of carbon , they will have 3.6 times _ more _ carbon free to form dust . this is a direct result of the reduced oxygen abundance , which limits how much carbon is sequestered as co. all things being equal , _ we would expect to see more carbon - rich dust at lower metallicities _ , and yet",

    "we even see a possible dip at the metal - poor end of our sample .      before giving up on our assumption that @xmath45 does not depend on metallicity",
    ", we should consider what might happen to this excess of free carbon at low metallicity .",
    "if the dust content stays flat or even falls , some other reservoir must be absorbing the carbon .",
    "sic represents only trace amounts , but the strengthening acetylene bands at lower metallicity could be a solution .",
    "table  [ t.mean ] shows that the mean strength of the 7.5  acetylene band is twice as strong in the smc than in the milky way , although the spread of the data about these means is considerable .",
    "if the 7.5  acetylene band accurately traces the total carbon mass in gaseous hydrocarbon molecules , then it follows from table  [ t.mean ] that hydrocarbon gases sequester two times more carbon in the typical carbon star in the smc compared to the milky way .",
    "while this is a significant amount of carbon in gaseous form , it is not enough to account for the factor of 3.6 more free carbon expected in the smc .",
    "we know of no other likely reservoir for the carbon , leading us to conclude that the amount of dredged up carbon ( @xmath45 ) must in fact decrease at lower metallicity . neither the rate at which the triple-@xmath41 sequence produces carbon nor the dredge - up efficiency should decrease at lower metallicity . to reduce @xmath45 , it is necessary to terminate the dredge - up process progressively earlier on the agb in more metal - poor stars .",
    "models by @xcite show that the opacity of carbon - rich dust is sufficient to drive the mass - loss process . if a dredge - up event during a thermal pulse drives the c / o ratio high enough , then the jump in free carbon will lead to a pulse of dust formation which could quickly strip the envelope and bring the agb evolution to a rapid end .",
    "@xcite proposed just such a scenario , although their definition of the free carbon differs from ours .",
    "the key point is that the trigger is not the c / o ratio , but the quantity of free carbon , modified , if seeds are important to the condensation process , by the abundances of elements such as ti and perhaps si . a spectroscopic census of the sgr dsph galaxy ( mcdonald et al .",
    ", in preparation ) finds that the typical lifetime of a star as a carbon star may be similar to the time between thermal pulses . once a star develops a carbon - rich envelope , the formation of dust and the loss of mass accelerates quickly .",
    "van loon et al .  ( 2008 ) explained the increasing acetylene band strengths in more metal - poor stars as a consequence of the lower abundances of elements like ti .",
    "the lower abundances would result in fewer available seeds like tic for the condensation of amorphous carbon dust , making the process less efficient .",
    "sic could play a similar role as a condensation seed .",
    "@xcite suggested that the decreasing sic emission at lower metallicity would arise naturally from decreasing si abundances .",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed this idea , explaining the different tracks of sic emission strength with [ 6.4]@xmath0[9.3 ] color in figure  [ f.69sic ] in the different samples as an increasingly delayed condensation of sic with decreasing metallicity .",
    "other seeds requiring heavy elements should behave similarly with decreasing metallicity . without these seeds at lower metallicities , the less efficient formation of amorphous carbon is likely to result in a greater fraction of the free carbon tied up in simpler molecules like acetylene .",
    "observations of magellanic planetary nebulae ( pne ) by @xcite create one difficulty for the idea that the reduced sic strength in metal - poor carbon stars arises from reduced si abundances .",
    "they found that strong emission features centered at @xmath311  in several spectra , and they attributed these features to sic .",
    "we suspect that the 11  feature in their pn spectra does not arise from sic , but instead from a different carrier .",
    "the pn features are triangular in shape and peak at @xmath311.1  , compared to the more rounded sic features which peak at @xmath311.3  .",
    "additionally , the pn features are usually associated with features at @xmath316  .",
    "both the 11 and 16  features are often seen in spectra showing the still unidentified 21  feature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sloan et al .  in preparation ) .      for evolved oxygen - rich stars , the gas - to - dust ratio should depend strongly on metallicity ,",
    "because the abundances of the elements which form oxygen - rich dust scale with metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the outflow velocity depends on the radiation pressure on the dust and its coupling to the gas due to collisions , and it should also vary with metallicity .",
    "the situation for carbon stars is different , because they produce the carbon which drives the mass - loss themselves .",
    "the spectra in this paper show that if the dust content decreases with lower metallicity , the dependence is weak and noticeable only for the most metal - poor stars observed .",
    "following the carbon budget leads us to the same conclusion as @xcite , that the free carbon serves as a trigger for the superwind phase .",
    "the lack of a strong dependence of carbon - rich dust content with metallicity makes it difficult to see how the gas - to - dust ratio or the outflow velocity should depend on metallicity .",
    "if radiation pressure accelerates the dust , and collisions between dust grains and gas molecules accelerate the gas , then the amount of dust would determine both outflow velocity and total mass - loss rate , and as we have shown , the amount of dust does not vary strongly with metallicity .",
    "if pulsations drive the mass - loss process , then the mass - loss rate will depend primarily on the pulsation period and amplitude , which are relatively insensitive to metallicity . again , neither the outflow velocity nor the gas - to - dust ratio should depend strongly on metallicity .",
    "a rigorous test of these predictions awaits observations from the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "less sensitive telescopes can be used to study carbon stars in the galactic halo .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of six carbon stars in the halo and found that they have smaller outflow velocities than carbon stars in the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite obtained infrared spectra of four of these carbon stars with the irs , and they found evidence suggesting that halo carbon stars also have high gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "thus , both outflow velocity and gas - to - dust ratio may depend on metallicity for carbon stars , after all , but some caution is in order .",
    "first , the metallicity of the observed carbon stars is uncertain ; they may be ejected from the galactic disk .",
    "second , if the outflow velocity of the dust is higher than the gas , then the inferred gas - to - dust ratios may not differ from the disk sample as much .",
    "the halo carbon stars raise some interesting possibilities , but these initial results require follow - up .",
    "the review of co line observations in galactic carbon stars by @xcite shows a range of possible outflow velocities , from a few km / s to over 20 km / s , with higher outflow velocities generally associated with higher total mass - loss rates .",
    "the relation between outflow velocity and total mass - loss rate is consistent with increasing amounts of circumstellar dust , which leads to more efficient acceleration of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "metallicity is not needed to explain the effect , even if the range of possible outflow velocities does inject a degree of caution when using equation  ( 1 ) or interpreting the mass - loss rates presented in table  [ t.dust ] .",

    "the invidual targets were chosen based on their red nir colors or their pulsation properties .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes of the two targets in sculptor , their pulsation periods , and reference to recent modelling work lead us to revise their estimated metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) up to @xmath3@xmath01.0 . similarly , we suggest that the carbon stars in fornax have metallicities more similar to the lmc and smc than to the other dwarfs studied .",
    "the mean metallicity in leo  i and carina are @xmath3 @xmath01.4 and @xmath01.7 , respectively .",
    "all carbon stars follow a general relation of increasing dust content as the pulsation period increases .",
    "metallicity does not show any influence down to [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath00.7 , so that despite their differences in initial metallicity , carbon stars in the galaxy , lmc , smc , and fornax with similar pulsation periods produce similar quantities of dust .",
    "the five stars observed in sculptor and leo  i produce less dust , at a significance level of 3.6  @xmath35 .",
    "the carbon stars in carina show no dust , but lack of pulsation periods prevent us from comparing them to the stars in the other galaxies .",
    "the new carbon stars extend the previously detected trends of decreasing emission from sic dust and increasing absorption from acetylene gas as the metallicity falls to even lower metallicities .",
    "the carbon stars in fornax show sic features and acetylene bands consistent with our revised metallicity .",
    "if the quantity of freshly produced carbon from the stellar interior to the photosphere does not depend on metallicity , the lower initial abundances of oxygen in more metal - poor stars would lead to substantially greater quantities of free carbon . yet , as our observations have shown , they do not produce substantially larger amounts of amorphous carbon dust . while more metal - poor stars do produce more acetylene gas , it is not enough to account for the expected increases of free carbon .",
    "we conclude that some process must truncate the dredge - up earlier in more metal - poor samples , quite likely a superwind triggered by a free - carbon threshold which strips the star of its envelope and ends its evolution on the agb .",

    "<S> we have observed a sample of 19 carbon stars in the sculptor , carina , fornax , and leo  i dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the infrared spectrograph on the _ spitzer space telescope . _ </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show significant quantities of dust around the carbon stars in sculptor , fornax , and leo  i , but little in carina . </S>",
    "<S> previous comparisons of carbon stars with similar pulsation properties in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds revealed no evidence that metallicity affected the production of dust by carbon stars . </S>",
    "<S> however , the more metal - poor stars in the current sample appear to be generating less dust . </S>",
    "<S> these data extend two known trends to lower metallicities . in more metal - poor samples , </S>",
    "<S> the sic dust emission weakens , while the acetylene absorption strengthens . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric magnitudes and infrared spectral properties of the carbon stars in fornax are consistent with metallicities more similar to carbon stars in the magellanic clouds than in the other dwarf spheroidals in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the carbon budget in these stars reinforces previous considerations that the dredge - up of sufficient quantities of carbon from the stellar cores may trigger the final superwind phase , ending a star s lifetime on the asymptotic giant branch . </S>"
