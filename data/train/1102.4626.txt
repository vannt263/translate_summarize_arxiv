    "analysis of the  data by @xcite revealed that the stellar velocity distribution in the solar neighbourhood manifested significant substructure . the heroic geneva - copenhagen survey ( hereafter gcs * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) followed up with radial velocity measurements of 14139 nearby f and g dwarf stars , which confirmed and strengthened dehnen s conclusion .",
    "the geneva - copenhagen survey was constructed so as to avoid most of the selection biases that went into the full  sample . aside from a concentration of 112 stars in the hyades cluster , the distribution of sample stars over the sky is remarkably uniform , with a slightly higher density in the declination range south of @xmath0 .",
    "the large majority of stars are within 200  pc of the sun and the sample within 40  pc is believed to be nearly complete .",
    "the cartesian heliocentric velocity components of stars near the sun in galactic coordinates are @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath1 being directed towards the galactic centre , @xmath2 being in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath3 towards the north galactic pole .",
    "the velocity substructure in the  is particularly evident in the @xmath4 plane , where the distribution is broken into a number of substantial streams , with no underlying smooth component .",
    "numerous studies @xcite have shown that the streams are both too substantial and chemically inhomogeneous to be dissolved star clusters @xcite .",
    "dynamical evolution is the most likely source of the features , which have been modelled extensively .",
    "@xcite suggest that the entire velocity distribution arises from a succession of transient spiral perturbations , while @xcite attribute some substructure to minor accretion events .",
    "individual features have been modelled as responses to the bar and/or various assumed spiral perturbations within the disc @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , which was extended by @xcite , identified the inner ultra - harmonic resonance of an assumed 2-arm spiral as a possible cause of both the hyades and sirius streams .",
    "by contrast , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) presented an analysis that did not need to assume a form for the perturbation .",
    "using action - angle coordinates , he showed that the stars of the hyades stream were both concentrated along a resonance line in action space and grouped in a combination of angle coordinates ( possibly ) indicative of a recent inner lindblad resonance ( hereafter ) . @xcite has confirmed most of his analysis , and concurs that a lindblad resonance is responsible but , unfortunately , was able to show that subtle selection effects in such local data imply that the distribution could also be consistent with trapping in an outer lindblad resonance ( ) .",
    "we discuss selection effects and mcmillan s analysis in the appendix .    while the  sample offered compelling evidence for a lindblad resonance",
    ", it is desirable to attempt to confirm the result from other independent surveys .",
    "the radial velocity experiment ( , * ? ? ? * ) , a large spectroscopic survey of stars in the southern sky , plans to measure the heliocentric radial velocities and stellar parameters for about a million stars in the apparent magnitude range @xmath5 ; the first @xmath6 were made available in the second data release @xcite .",
    "the typical uncertainty in the radial velocity is @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 , but the distance to most stars has to be judged photometrically and most proper motions are from ground - based data . thus the three phase space coordinates for each star are of much lower quality than are those in the geneva - copenhagen survey , although this weakness will , when the survey is complete , be compensated by a much larger sample size . the huge northern sloan digital sky survey ( , * ? ? ? * ) and segue2 @xcite surveys are complete , but sample fainter stars ( the magnitude range for segue2 was @xmath9 ) that are therefore generally more distant than are the  stars .",
    "the recently - released m - dwarf sample of  stars @xcite substantially increases the number of stars with estimated distances and kinematics within the neighbourhood of the sun .",
    "we have downloaded the on - line table of the second data release from the  website and selected a subset of stars for analysis .",
    "we estimate distances to these stars by fitting to the yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite using a method related to that described by @xcite .",
    "we adopt many of their selection criteria : we require the spectral signal - to - noise parameter @xmath10 with a blank spectral warning flag field ; the parameters [ m / h ] , log(@xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 to be determined ; and the stars to have j & k@xmath13 magnitudes from two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with no warning flags about the identification of the star or the 2mass photometry .",
    "unlike those authors , however , we have kept stars with @xmath14 on the grounds that extinction for the nearby stars that interest us will not be large enough in the near ir to severely bias our distance estimates .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , propose formulae for estimating the absolute magnitudes , @xmath38 , from the @xmath39 colour , or from the @xmath40 colour and [ fe / h ] but , as for the  stars , we have preferred to estimate distances by fitting the full stellar parameters to isochrone tables .",
    "the dartmouth isochrone tables @xcite give absolute magnitudes in sloan colour bands .",
    "we interpolate for [ fe / h ] , for all ages and with [ @xmath18/fe]=0 only , to estimate @xmath41 by fitting @xmath39 colours , together with  estimates of [ fe / h ] , log@xmath42 , and @xmath12 .",

    "we find 38690 stars whose best estimate of distance modulus in the @xmath45-band places them within 2  kpc .",
    "[ ivezic ] illustrates the superiority of isochrone fitting over relying on a single colour index .",

    "* eqs .  a2 & a7 ) .",
    "the red points show the isochrone - fitted @xmath38 magnitude obtained as described above ; note that the  does not return parameters for stars having @xmath46 , which is the reason for the absence of credible main sequence stars redward of @xmath47 . for the large majority of stars , the blue and red points fill the same region of the figure , and are therefore consistent ; the two magnitude estimates differ by @xmath48 mag for 89% of the stars .",
    "but , as is physically reasonable , isochrone fitting broadens the distribution near the main sequence turn off , although the spread may be spuriously enhanced by errors in the pipeline parameters , especially in @xmath49 . the principal advantage of isochrone fitting , however , is that it flags stars with inconsistent parameters .",
    "the green triangles show 938 stars that had @xmath19 , based on the above uncertainties , for the smallest difference between the estimated @xmath39 colour , @xmath12 , and @xmath49 of any model star in the dartmouth isochrone tables .",
    "a large @xmath50 generally arises for a star that has a colour ( we used @xmath39 ) estimate inconsistent with the pipeline - estimated @xmath12 , although the estimated @xmath49 may be inconsistent in other cases . we therefore adopt the absolute magnitudes given by the isochrone fits to estimate distances , discarding the stars having a large @xmath50 .    -velocity uncertainties for the selected sample of 629  stars . ]",

    "their table provides a photometric estimate of the distance to each star , as well as a radial velocity and proper motion from usno - b / sdss catalogue @xcite .",
    "they suggest that distance uncertainties are typically about 20% and uncertainties in radial velocity are 7 - 10  km s@xmath8 .",
    "as @xcite recommend , we selected stars with the `` goodpm '' and `` goodphot '' flags set to ` true ' , and the `` wdm '' flag set to ` false ' to eliminate possible binaries with a white dwarf companion , which reduces the sample to 39151 stars .",
    "we further excluded stars having no radial velocity as well as those with no distance estimate or for which the estimated distance exceeded 500  pc .",
    "finally , we also eliminated stars for which any component of the heliocentric velocity exceeded 80  km s@xmath8 and those having a vertical energy that would take them farther than 400  pc from the disc mid - plane , leaving us with a final sample of 10,669 stars .",
    "we estimated uncertainties in the velocity components , @xmath1 , @xmath2 & @xmath3 by combining the 20% distance uncertainty , a 10  km s@xmath8 uncertainty in the radial velocity , and the proper motion uncertainties .",

    "the three surveys yielded a total sample of some 16443 stars within 500  pc . since few stars in these surveys are close to zero galactic latitude , the in - plane velocity components @xmath1 and @xmath2 are mostly determined by the proper motion , with the more - precise radial velocity making a smaller contribution . for this reason , we confine all the following analysis to the @xmath54 stars closer than 200  pc to the sun , which have correspondingly smaller uncertainties in these two velocity components .",
    "we refer to this as our final `` combined sample '' .",
    "note that the combined sample contains just four stars from the  survey , and no stars from the , that were also in the .",

    "the strongest feature is the hyades stream , but the bottom left panel has clear hints of the pleiades , sirius , and even hercules streams . note that errors in our distance estimates will give rise to correlated errors in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 velocity components , since they are derived mostly from proper motions .",

    "we therefore consider this sample of stars to support the evidence for a lindblad resonance found in paper i , although here again the data do not constrain the multiplicity of the pattern .",
    "while it is unfortunate that these data do not rule out trapping at an  as the cause of the hyades stream , it is worth noting that @xcite examined the effect on the local phase space due to the  of the bar and did not find any hyades stream - like features .",

    "@xcite reported that features that extend upward towards smaller @xmath90 for increasing @xmath71 ( or @xmath91 are created by s in his simulations .",

    "both the present sample and the  sample of paper i were confined to stars that happen to lie near the sun at present .",
    "since stars move on eccentric orbits , most stars in the sample are merely visiting the solar vicinity from farther afield .",
    "[ draw ] shows four possible orbits of stars near the sun that all happen to pass through the ( shaded ) survey volume .",
    "the orbits are drawn in the frame of the  and have sufficiently small radial excursions to approximate lindblad epicycles .",
    "all four orbits have the same @xmath71 ( epicycle size ) ; those labelled 2 & 4 , with guiding centres ( plus symbols ) lying on the solar circle , have the same @xmath92 as does the sun , while orbits 1 & 3 have , respectively , greater and smaller values of @xmath70 .",
    "orbits 2 & 4 are closed ellipses , because their guiding centres move at the same angular rate as the frame , but the guiding centres of the other two ellipses , which are marked at the point of the star s closest approach to the sun , drift relative to the . for clarity",
    ", the orbits shown do not loop around the sun so that the vectors , which show peculiar velocities relative to the , appear to correlate with the direction of the star from the solar position .",
    "in reality , stars anywhere in the survey region can have peculiar velocities in any direction .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is the instantaneous galactic azimuth of the guiding centre , which ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) chose to be zero on the line connecting the sun to the galactic centre .",
    "thus @xmath93 for stars ahead of the sun .",
    "the @xmath79 variable is the phase of the star around its epicycle , which increases with time in the sense shown by the arrows .",
    "again @xcite adopted @xmath94 for a star at its apocentre and consequently @xmath95 for a star at its pericentre .",
    "note that action - angle variables , unlike lindblad s epicycles , can also be used for more eccentric orbits , for which the guiding centres generally orbit more slowly than the circular speed and the radial oscillation is anharmonic .",
    "4 of paper i showed the separate distributions of @xmath79 and @xmath77 for stars in the  sample having @xmath96 . here ,",
    "[ angdist ] shows the joint distribution of the same stars in the space of both angles .",
    "the azimuthal phase distribution is confined to @xmath97 reflecting the limited spread in galactic azimuths of the guiding centres for stars that pass through the survey volume .    the distribution of @xmath77 values for stars having @xmath94 , such as orbit 3 in fig .",
    "[ draw ] , or @xmath95 ( orbit 1 ) is very narrow because their guiding centres lie along the radius vector from the galactic centre to the sun for all values of @xmath71 .",
    "stars in the first quadrant of fig .",
    "[ angdist ] are inward moving stars ( because @xmath98 ) with guiding centres ahead of the sun ( @xmath99 ) , such as orbit 4 .",
    "conversely , stars in the third quadrant ( @xmath100 ) are outward moving stars having @xmath101 (  orbit 2 ) .",
    "thus the selection criteria preclude stars from lying in the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "the spread of @xmath77 values for @xmath102 reflects the spread in the sizes of the epicycles of the stars in the sample , from which more eccentric orbits were eliminated .",
    "@xcite argued that a concentration of stars having a nearly constant value of @xmath82 would be an indicator of trapping in a resonance for the selected values of @xmath104 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus he searched for an excess of stars lying along lines of fixed slope with all possible intercepts in this plot , and reported the results in his fig .",
    "7 of paper i for the  sample .",
    "the lines for inner lindblad resonances ( @xmath73 ) have a positive slope in fig .  [ angdist ] .",
    "their slopes decrease as @xmath65 increases , causing them to become more closely parallel to the distribution near @xmath105 , giving rise to a peak near @xmath106 as @xmath65 increases .",
    "the distributions shown in fig .  7 of paper i for @xmath58 and @xmath80 , and in fig",
    ".  [ restest4 ] of this paper , show the increasing prominence of this feature , which is purely an artefact of the sample selection .",
    "a similar feature appears near @xmath107 when @xmath108 , since the lines have negative slope in these cases .",
    "@xcite drew attention to the peaks that lay away from @xmath109 for the cases of inner lindblad resonances .",
    "these peaks arise in part from the concentration of  stars near @xmath110 , @xmath111 in fig  [ angdist ] , but the clump is visibly extended , which @xcite described as having a triangular shape . since the excess lies in the third quadrant , it gives rise to peaks in the distributions of @xmath112 that shift closer to zero as @xmath65 is increased .",
    "obviously the same excess gives rise to peaks near @xmath113 for lines of negative slope in the cases of an  but , at least for the  sample , they are not as striking as those for the  cases .",
    "the case for an  made by @xcite did not rest solely on this slight difference , however .",
    "he attached far greater significance to the fact that stars lying along a line of positive slope extending through the clump were exactly those that lay along the resonant scattering tongue in action space , as shown in fig .",
    "8 of paper i. as this was not the case for stars lying on lines of negative slope , sellwood concluded that an  was responsible .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite found that his conclusion was compromised by selection effects : if stars are not only in the vicinity of the sun but are also trapped in a resonance , mcmillan was able to show that _ both _  and  models give rise to features in the angle distribution ( , fig .",
    "[ angdist ] ) having positive slope .",
    "thus , although scattering at a lindblad resonance was clearly established , the test in paper i did not enable the character of the resonance to be determined ."
