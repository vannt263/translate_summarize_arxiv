    "nuclear physics has a well developed phenomenology in terms of nucleons interacting through potentials constrained by nucleon - nucleon scattering data . at the same time ,",
    "nucleons and nuclei are aggregates of quarks and gluons residing in the hadronic , low - temperature phase of qcd . in recent years , the understanding of the nucleon itself , in particular of its low - energy , long - wavelength structure , has been progressing rapidly .",
    "likewise , steps have been taken to explore the possible connection of the nuclear many - body problem with low - energy qcd , its symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "it is therefore timely and appropriate to discuss these two related themes from a unifying perspective .      at low energies confinement",
    "implies that the qcd eigenstates are not elementary quarks and gluons but hadrons , colour singlet composites of quarks and gluons .",
    "confinement also implies that the chiral @xmath0 symmetry of two - flavour qcd with ( almost ) massless @xmath1- and @xmath2-quarks is spontaneously broken . as a consequence ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is non - trivial : it hosts a strong condensate of ( scalar ) quark - antiquark pairs , the chiral condensate @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "goldstone s theorem states that there exist low frequency collective excitations of the condensed qcd ground state : pseudoscalar goldstone bosons , identified with the pions .",
    "their mass vanishes in the exact chiral limit , i.e. for massless @xmath1- and @xmath2-quarks .",
    "the finite but small physical pion mass , @xmath5gev , reflects the non - zero quark masses @xmath6mev .",
    "goldstone s theorem also states that these pions interact weakly at low energy and momentum .",
    "in fact , their interaction strictly vanishes in the exact chiral limit and at zero energy and momentum .",
    "a charged pion decays through weak interaction into a muon and an antineutrino .",
    "the hadronic matrix element of the axial vector current connecting the pion with the qcd vacuum determines the pion decay constant , @xmath7 , with the empirical value @xmath8mev .",
    "this constant reflects , as an order parameter , the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of the qcd ground state just like the chiral ( quark ) condensate itself .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern of low - energy qcd is manifest in a characteristic mass gap that governs the spectrum of the lightest hadrons .",
    "the scale associated with this mass gap is @xmath9gev .",
    "low - energy qcd is the physics of strong interactions at energies and momenta small compared to the 1 gev scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . in this low - frequency",
    ", long - wavelength limit qcd is realized in the form of an effective field theory of weakly interacting goldstone bosons coupled to heavier hadrons which act as almost static sources . given this scenario ,",
    "we address the following questions :    * how does the nucleon develop its mass , starting from almost massless quarks , and what role does the pion cloud of the nucleon play in this context ? * what is the impact of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in qcd on the nuclear many - body problem ?",
    "the mass scale set by the gap @xmath10 offers a natural separation between `` light '' and `` heavy '' ( or , correspondingly , `` fast '' and `` slow '' ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic idea of an effective field theory is to introduce the active light particles as collective degrees of freedom , while the heavy particles are treated as almost static . in low - energy qcd ,",
    "the `` light '' particles are the pions whereas the nucleons figure as `` heavy '' .",
    "the low - energy strong interaction dynamics is described by an effective lagrangian which incorporates all relevant symmetries of qcd .",
    "the elementary quarks and gluons of the original lagrangian are now replaced by the goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "heavy particles , such as nucleons , act as sources for the goldstone bosons .",
    "their leading - order couplings are determined by the noether currents of the underlying symmetries .    in the sector of qcd with the two lightest quark flavours , relevant to most of nuclear physics ,",
    "the goldstone bosons are represented by a @xmath11 matrix field @xmath12 which collects the three isospin components @xmath13 of the pion .",
    "a convenient representation is @xmath14 $ ] where the pion decay constant @xmath15 in the chiral limit provides a suitable normalisation .",
    "in essence , the qcd lagrangian is replaced by an effective lagrangian expressed in terms of @xmath16 and its derivatives : @xmath17 goldstone bosons do not interact unless they have non - zero four - momentum , so the low - energy expansion of @xmath18 is an ordering in powers of @xmath19 .",

    "not shown in eq.(3 ) is a series of additional terms of order @xmath37 .",
    "these terms come with further constants that need to be fitted to experimental data and reflect , for instance , the very important role played by the @xmath38 resonance in pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "baryon chpt , the calculational framework based on @xmath26 , has been applied quite successfully to a variety of low - energy processes ( such as pion - nucleon scattering , threshold pion photo- and electroproduction and compton scattering on the nucleon ) for which increasingly accurate experimental data have become available in the last decade .",
    "reviews can be found in @xcite . in recent years",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction at long and intermediate distance scales has also become an active area of chpt @xcite .",
    "understanding the nucleon mass is clearly one of the most fundamental issues in nuclear and particle physics @xcite .",

    "while ioffe s formula needs to be improved by including condensates of higher dimension , it nevertheless demonstrates the close connection between dynamical mass generation and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd",
    ". for nuclear physics , eq.(7 ) gives important hints @xcite : the change of the condensate @xmath52 with increasing baryon density implies a significant reduction of the nucleon mass in the nuclear medium .",
    "this observation finds its correspondence in the strong scalar field as it appears in phenomenological relativistic mean field models @xcite .    in chiral effective field theory",
    ", the quark mass dependence of @xmath48 translates into a dependence on the pion mass , @xmath53 , at leading order .",

    "the systematic chiral expansion of the nucleon mass gives an expression of the form @xcite : @xmath54 where the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath2 multiplying even powers of the pion mass include low - energy constants constrained by pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 also involves a @xmath56 term .",
    "note that the piece of order @xmath57 ( non - analytic in the quark mass ) is given model - independently in terms of the known weak decay constants @xmath58 and @xmath7 ( strictly speaking : by their values in the chiral limit ) .",
    "the interpolation shown in fig.2 determines the nucleon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath32 , and the sigma term @xmath59 .",
    "one finds @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 mev @xcite in this approach .",
    "( treating the @xmath62 isobar as an explicit degree of freedom rather than absorbing it in low - energy constants , there is a tendency for slightly larger values of @xmath63 ) .              the prominent role played by the pion as a goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry has its strong impact on the low - energy structure and dynamics of nucleons .",
    "when probing the individual nucleon with long - wavelength fields , a substantial part of the response comes from the pion cloud , the `` soft  surface of the nucleon .",
    "while these features are well known and established for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , its scalar - isoscalar meson cloud is less familiar and frequently obscured by the notion of an ' ' effective sigma meson \" .",
    "on the other hand , the scalar field of the nucleon is at the origin of the intermediate range nucleon - nucleon force , the source of attraction that binds nuclei .",
    "let us therefore have a closer look , guided by chiral effective field theory .",
    "consider the nucleon form factor related to the scalar - isoscalar quark density , @xmath64 , at squared momentum transfer @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , a better quantity to work with is the form factor @xmath66 associated with the scale invariant object @xmath67 .",
    "assume that this form factor can be written as a subtracted dispersion relation : @xmath68 where the sigma term @xmath63 introduced previously enters as a subtraction constant .",
    "we are interested in spacelike momentum transfers with @xmath69 .",
    "the dispersion integral in eq.(19 ) starts out at the two - pion threshold .",
    "it involves the spectral function @xmath70 which includes all @xmath71 excitations coupled to the nucleon : a continuum of even numbers of pions added to and interacting with the nucleon core .",
    "chiral perturbation theory at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in two - loop approximation has been applied in a recent calculation of the spectral function @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this calculation includes not only nucleon born terms and leading @xmath72 interactions but also important effects of intermediate @xmath62 isobar excitations in the two - pion dressing of the nucleon core ( see fig.3a ) . the result ( fig.4 )",
    "can be compared with the `` empirical '' scalar - isoscalar spectral function deduced by analytic continuation from @xmath27 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "note that there is no such thing as a `` sigma meson '' in this spectrum which is completely determined by the ( chiral ) dynamics of the interacting @xmath72 and @xmath27 system .",
    "the integral over @xmath74 is proportional to the mean squared scalar radius of the nucleon .",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath75 the largest of all nucleon radii , considerably larger than the proton charge radius of 0.86 fm .      by its magnitude and range",
    ", the form factor @xmath76 implies that the nucleon , surrounded with its two - pion cloud , is the source of a strong scalar - isoscalar field with a large effective coupling constant @xmath77 .",
    "when a second nucleon couples to this scalar field ( see fig .",
    "1b ) , the resulting two - pion exchange @xmath78 interaction @xmath79 is reminiscent of a van der waals force .",
    "more than half of the strength of @xmath79 is actually governed by the large spin - isospin polarisability of the nucleon related to the transition @xmath80 in the intermediate state . at long and intermediate distances",
    "it behaves as @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a polynomial in @xmath83 . in the chiral limit @xmath84 ,",
    "this @xmath79 approaches the characteristic @xmath85 dependence of a non - relativistic van der waals potential .",
    "the two - pion exchange force is the major source of intermediate range attraction that binds nuclei .",
    "this is , of course , not a new observation .",
    "for example , the important role of the second - order tensor force from iterated pion exchange had been emphasised long ago @xcite , as well as the close connection of the nuclear force to the strong spin - isospin polarisability of the nucleon @xcite . the new element that has entered",
    "the discussion more recently is the systematics provided by chiral effective field theory in dealing with these phenomena .",
    "in nuclear matter , the relevant momentum scale is the fermi momentum @xmath86 . around the empirical saturation point with @xmath87 gev @xmath88 , the fermi momentum and the pion mass are scales of comparable magnitude .",
    "this implies that at the densities of interest in nuclear physics , @xmath89 @xmath90 , pions must be included as _ explicit _ degrees of freedom : their propagation in matter is `` resolved '' at the relevant momentum scales around the fermi momentum .    at the same time ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath91 are small compared to the characteristic chiral scale , @xmath92 gev .",
    "consequently , methods of chiral perturbation theory are expected to be applicable to nuclear matter at least in a certain window around @xmath93 . in that range , the energy density @xmath94\\rho\\,.\\ ]",
    "] should then be given as a convergent power series in the fermi momentum .",
    "this is our working hypothesis .",
    "more precisely , the energy per particle has an expansion @xmath95 the expansion coefficients @xmath96 are in general non - trivial functions of @xmath97 , the dimensionless ratio of the two relevant scales .",
    "these functions must obviously not be further expanded .",
    "apart from @xmath86 and @xmath98 , a third relevant `` small '' scale is the mass difference @xmath99 gev between the @xmath38 and the nucleon .",
    "the strong spin - isospin transition from the nucleon to the @xmath62 isobar is therefore to be included as an additional important ingredient in nuclear many - body calculations , so that the @xmath96 become functions of both @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "let us get a first impression of how the separation of scales controls the scattering amplitude @xmath102 for two nucleons ( with momenta @xmath103 ) interacting in the nuclear medium .",
    "omitting its detailed operator structure here for brevity , we denote this amplitude as @xmath104 and assume that it satisfies , at fixed energy , a subtracted dispersion relation @xmath105\\ , , \\ ] ] with subtraction constants @xmath106 . here",
    "@xmath107 is the ( spacelike ) squared momentum transfered in the t - channel .",
    "the amplitudes ( with index @xmath108 ) are grouped in a hierarchy of terms according to the number of goldstone bosons ( pions ) exchanged between the two nucleons , or any other mechanisms that may occur at short distance ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the corresponding spectral functions @xmath109 start at a characteristic threshold @xmath110 in each channel ( e.g. @xmath111 for two - pion exchange , @xmath112 for three - pion exchange , and so forth ) .",
    "the influence of the pauli principle in intermediate nn states generally leads to a @xmath86-dependence of these spectral functions .    in the ground state of nuclear matter ,",
    "the external nucleon lines in fig.5 have momenta in the fermi sea .",
    "the exchanged momentum is limited to @xmath113 , with an average at @xmath114 .",
    "clearly , in all those processes which have spectral functions starting at @xmath115 , the amplitudes in ( 14 ) reduce to the approximate form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is proportional to the mean square distance over which this interaction takes place .",
    "these short - distance contributions with @xmath118 are thus represented as contact terms ( the constants @xmath106 ) , corrected by small finite range ( derivative ) terms . on the other hand , processes with @xmath119 obviously require a full treatment of their spectral integrals in eq.(14 ) . for nuclear densities with @xmath120 , one- and two - pion exchange processes ( as well as those involving low - energy particle - hole excitations )",
    "must therefore be treated explicitly .",
    "they govern the long - range interactions at the distance scales @xmath121 fm relevant to the nuclear many - body problem , whereas short - range mechanisms , with t - channel spectral functions involving much larger masses , are not resolved in detail at nuclear fermi momentum scales and can be subsumed in contact interactions .",
    "this is the `` separation of scales '' argument that makes strategies of chiral effective field theory work even for nuclear problems , with the `` small '' scales ( @xmath122 ) distinct from the `` large '' ones ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the filled fermi sea of nucleons is an important prerequisite for applying low - energy perturbative expansions which would not work in the vacuum .",
    "the chiral effective lagrangian ( 3 ) generates the basic pion - nucleon coupling terms used in leading - order chpt .",
    "it is of interest @xcite to explore whether and to what extent this leading - order chiral dynamics can already produce binding and saturation of nuclear matter .",
    "the new ingredient in performing calculations at finite density ( as compared to evaluations of scattering processes in vacuum ) is the in - medium nucleon propagator . for a relativistic nucleon with four - momentum @xmath124 it reads @xmath125",
    "the second term is the medium insertion which accounts for the fact that the ground state of the system has changed from an `` empty '' vacuum to a filled fermi sea of nucleons .",
    "diagrams can then be organized systematically in the number of medium insertions , and an expansion is performed in leading inverse powers of the nucleon mass , consistently with the @xmath86-expansion .",
    "our `` inward - bound '' strategy @xcite is now as follows .",
    "one starts at large distances ( small @xmath86 ) and systematically generates the pion - induced correlations between nucleons as they develop with decreasing distance ( increasing @xmath86 ) .",
    "calculations along these lines @xcite have been performed to 3-loop order in the energy density ( see fig.6 ) , including terms up to order @xmath126 .",
    "these calculations incorporate one- and two - pion exchange processes .",
    "hartree contributions from one - pion exchange vanish for a spin - saturated system , and the one - pion exchange fock term ( upper left of fig.6 ) is small , so the leading effect comes from the exchange of two pions , with the second order tensor force ( in the upper middle diagram of fig.6 ) providing the dominant attraction .    at order @xmath127 , the momentum space loop integral with iterated pion exchange encounters a divergence which needs to be regularised .",
    "this can be done in two equivalent ways .",
    "either one introduces a high - momentum cutoff @xmath128 ; or one removes the divergent parts using dimensional regularisation and replaces them by a counter term .",
    "both procedures are equivalent to introducing a subtraction constant in a corresponding dispersion relation approach . in either case one",
    "ends up with an adjustable @xmath78 contact interaction which encodes dynamics at short distances not resolved explicitly in the effective low - energy theory .",
    "this single contact term is the only free parameter at this stage .",
    "adjusting it to the binding energy of nuclear matter , the outcome is quite remarkable @xcite : despite its simplicity , this schematic one - parameter approach already produces nuclear binding and saturation ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "one finds @xmath129 mev at an equilibrium density @xmath130 @xmath131 together with a ( predicted ) compressibility @xmath132 mev ( empirical : @xmath133 mev @xcite ) .",
    "the extension to asymmetric nuclear matter gives a calculated asymmetry energy per nucleon , @xmath134 mev with no additional parameter ( empirical : @xmath135 mev @xcite ) .",
    "this result suggests that isospin dependent interactions are to large extent already accounted for by chiral pion dynamics , without necessity of introducing extra ingredients such as the @xmath136 meson .    in the scenario just described , entirely based on just leading order chiral pion - nucleon dynamics , the binding and saturation of nuclear matter comes from the balance between two mechanisms : ( a ) second order pion exchange with high - momentum cutoff which gives driving attraction proportional to @xmath137 in the energy per particle ; ( b ) the pauli exclusion principle acting on intermediate nucleon states of the two - pion pion exchange processes , which generates a repulsive contribution of order @xmath138 .",
    "this @xmath139 term is finite and uniquely determined in a model independent way , free of adjustable parameters , involving only known low - energy constants ( @xmath140 ) and masses ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this statement remains unchanged when higher orders in the small - scale expansion are included .",
    "it is instructive to examine the expansion ( 13 ) in the chiral limit ( @xmath142 ) where the basic saturation mechanism is already apparent @xcite . in this limit",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath127 and @xmath138 terms of @xmath143 become : @xmath144 ~~,\\ ] ] where small corrections from the one - pion exchange fock term and from the expansion of the kinetic energy have been dropped .",
    "one notes that the model - independent @xmath145 @xmath4 is remarkably close to the empirical @xmath146 @xmath4 .",
    "a high - momentum cutoff scale @xmath128 in the 0.5 gev range matches the equivalent contact interaction proportional to @xmath136 for which the empirically required strength is @xmath147 @xmath148 .     as function of baryon density .",
    "the calculation @xcite includes pions , nucleons and @xmath62 isobars at three - loop order in the free - energy density , plus corrections from three - body terms at @xmath149 in the energy per particle . ]",
    "while these exploratory first steps look quite promising , reproducing bulk properties of nuclear ( and neutron ) matter is just a necessary but by no means sufficient condition to deal with the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "chiral dynamics with just pions and nucleons gives a surprisingly good start for first orientation , but at that ( yet incomplete ) level of the discussion , details such as the momentum dependence of the nucleon single particle potential and the density of states at the fermi surface do not yet come out satisfactorily @xcite .",
    "a further indicator for still missing degrees of freedom is the fact that chiral dynamics restricted to pions and nucleons alone gives the critical temperature for the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite too large by about 20 - 25% .",
    "the next important step is to incorporate the strong @xmath150 transition in the two - pion exchange dynamics , together with related three - nucleon forces and pauli corrections .",
    "such effects were also found to be important in the ab - initio calculations of the illinois group @xcite .",
    "this extended chiral approach @xcite has two subtraction constants encoding unresolved short - distance dynamics in the functions @xmath151 and a genuine three - body term which corrects @xmath152 , but no changes appear in the @xmath153 term from the inclusion of @xmath62 isobars .",
    "the results for both nuclear and neutron matter are now much improved .",
    "in particular , the momentum dependent ( complex ) nucleon single - particle potential comes out very well in the momentum range @xmath154 mev / c .",
    "the hugenholz - van hove theorem is strictly fulfilled throughout the procedure .    in this scenario ,",
    "nuclear many - body dynamics emerges primarily from the van der waals - like nature of the attractive two - pion exchange forces in combination with the repulsive action of the pauli principle .",
    "it is therefore perhaps not surprising that the resulting equation of state at finite temperature @xcite ( see fig.8 ) is reminiscent of the one familiar from a van der waals gas .",
    "the predicted liquid - gas transition temperature @xmath155 mev is now close to the empirically deduced value , @xmath156 mev @xcite .    at that stage",
    "the present approach , guided by chiral effective field theory representing low - energy qcd , treats nucleons basically as non - relativistic particles : the low - momentum , small - scale expansion of the energy density is simultaneously an expansion in inverse powers of the nucleon mass .",
    "contact with the phenomenological non - relativistic skyrme - type energy density functional can be made at this point @xcite .",
    "general features of nuclear skyrme phenomenology - including surface ( gradient ) terms - are well reproduced around the densities relevant for nuclei ( although the chiral approach predicts pronounced density dependence of the skyrme parameters at low densities , induced by strong pionic effects when the fermi momentum becomes comparable to the pion mass ) .",
    "a further interesting comparison can be made with the universal low - momentum nn interaction , @xmath157(low - k ) , derived from a variety of phase - shift equivalent potentials using renormalisation group methods @xcite . at the hartree level ( linear in the density @xmath136 )",
    ", the single particle potential generated by @xmath157(low - k ) agrees well with the one derived from chiral dynamics , whereas non - trivial density dependence takes over in the chiral potential already at relatively low density , reflecting the action of the pauli principle on in - medium two - pion exchange processes @xcite .",
    "there is one place , however , where the non - relativistically reduced chiral theory fails completely : it misses the strength of the nuclear spin - orbit force by a large factor .",
    "the detailed investigation of mechanisms which generate a spin - orbit interaction from two - pion exchange ( both from the second order tensor force and from terms with intermediate @xmath62 s ) reveals that these contributions cancel to a large extent @xcite .",
    "this is a hint that genuine relativistic effects , not visible in bulk properties of infinite homogeneous nuclear matter , must be considered .      in relativistic nuclear models",
    "@xcite , strong lorentz scalar and vector mean fields , each several hundred mev in magnitude , are at the origin of the abnormally large spin - orbit splitting observed in nuclei .",
    "while these scalar and vector fields roughly cancel in the average single particle potential so that their individual strengths are not revealed in the energy per nucleon , they act coherently in building up the spin - orbit potential .",
    "in - medium qcd sum rules @xcite give some guidance as to where such strong fields have their sources .",

    "is expressed in terms of the density dependent chiral condensate as follows @xcite : @xmath164    = - \\frac{8 \\pi^2}{\\lambda_b^2}~\\frac{\\sigma_n}{m_u + m_d } \\rho_s = -{\\sigma_n m_n \\over m_\\pi^2 f_\\pi^2}\\rho_s \\ ; , \\ ] ] with the nucleon scalar density @xmath165 .",
    "the difference between the vacuum condensate @xmath166 and the one at finite density involves the nucleon sigma term ( 5 ) .",
    "the borel scale @xmath167 which roughly separates perturbative and non - perturbative domains in the qcd sum rule analysis , has been eliminated in the last step , using the ioffe relation ( 7 ) together with @xmath168 .",
    "the interpretation of eq.(17 ) is as follows : once nucleons are present in the qcd vacuum , they polarise this vacuum in such a way that the magnitude of the ( negative ) chiral condensate gets reduced with increasing density . the resulting attractive scalar mean field is large : @xmath169 or @xmath170 mev at @xmath171 @xmath4 ( using @xmath172 mev ) , implying that the nucleon mass in nuclear matter is effectively reduced by more than 1/3 of its vacuum value . to the same order in the condensates with lowest dimension , the time component of the isoscalar vector self - energy is @xmath173 it reflects the repulsive density - density correlations associated with the time component of the quark current , @xmath174 .",
    "note that , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the ratio @xmath175 is approximately equal to @xmath176 for typical values of the nucleon sigma term @xmath63 and the current quark masses @xmath177 , and around nuclear matter saturation density where @xmath178 ( as an example , take @xmath179 mev and @xmath180 mev at a renormalisation scale corresponding to the chiral `` gap '' @xmath181 gev ) .",
    "the individually strong scalar and vector fields thus balance each other in the average single particle potential , @xmath182 , and the resulting small contribution simply gets absorbed in the subtraction constant attached to the @xmath127 term of the chiral expansion of the energy per nucleon .",
    "however , when introducing local densities for finite systems so that @xmath183 and @xmath184 , the spin - orbit potential @xmath185 has a huge strength proportional to @xmath186 gev , just the one required by phenomenology .    while useful for further orientation , the qcd sum rule constraints ( 17 - 20 ) are of course not very precise at a quantitative level .",
    "the estimated error in the ratio @xmath187 is about 20% , given the limited accuracy in the values of @xmath63 and @xmath188 .",
    "the leading - order ioffe formula ( 7 ) on which eq.(17 ) relies has corrections from condensates of higher dimension . in previous qcd sum rule studies the largest uncertainty came from the unknown density dependence of the four - quark condensates",
    "this uncertainty is now considerably reduced , however , by the explicit calculation of chiral two - pion exchange contributions to the in - medium nucleon self - energy .",
    "the translation to finite nuclei is best performed using the ( relativistic ) density functional framework ( for recent reviews , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "schematically , the energy of the nucleus is written as @xmath190 = t_{kin } + \\int d^3x \\,[{\\cal e}_{bg}(\\rho ) + { \\cal e}_{ex}(\\rho ) ] + e_{coul}\\,.\\ ] ] with the density @xmath191 expressed in terms of the self - consistent nucleon wave functions @xmath192 of the occupied orbits .",
    "we associate the `` background '' part @xmath193 of the energy density with the strong scalar and vector mean fields generated by in - medium changes of qcd condensates , while the `` exchange correlation '' part @xmath194 includes the pionic fluctuations and pauli principle effects , calculated using in - medium chiral perturbation theory as described in section 3.2 . at a practical level ,",
    "the calculations generating the energy density functional are conveniently done by introducing an equivalent effective lagrangian with density dependent four - point couplings between nucleons , @xmath195 while this auxiliary lagrangian is formally designed to be used in the mean - field limit , its physics content reaches out much further .",
    "quantum fluctuations beyond mean field are incorporated through the density dependent coupling strengths , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , which multiply the interaction terms @xmath198 with operators @xmath199 , @xmath200 etc .",
    "the matching to the nuclear matter calculations is done at the level of the nucleon self - energies expanded in powers of the fermi momentum , or equivalently , in powers of @xmath201 .",
    "this procedure involves the so - called rearrangement terms that occur , as a consequence of the density dependent couplings , in order to maintain thermodynamic consistency .",
    "electromagnetic interactions @xmath202 are also included .",
    "detailed calculations along these lines are reported in @xcite , and the framework is summarised and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent dirac equation is solved for the single - particle orbits of each given nucleus , so far covering a broad range from @xmath203o to @xmath204pb and to be further extended .",
    "the optimal reproduction of binding energies , radii and form factors of the whole set of nuclei requires fine - tuning of the density dependent coupling strengths @xmath196 .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that this fine - tuning systematically remains within less than 10% of the constraints set by low - energy qcd in terms of chiral pion dynamics and density dependent condensates .",
    "the additional surface ( derivative ) term in eq.(23 ) turns out to be perfectly consistent with the corresponding gradient terms found in the in - medium chpt calculation of inhomogeneous nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "we now present a few representative examples of results from such calculations @xcite .",
    "fig.9 shows the single particle spectra for neutrons and protons in @xmath205 .",
    "while the binding of these levels is governed by chiral two - pion exchange in the presence of the filled fermi sea ( the `` van der waals plus pauli '' mechanisms that we referred to earlier ) , the spin - orbit splitting is completely determined by the strong scalar and vector mean fields that can be interpreted as arising from in - medium changes of the condensate structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "fig.10 shows our calculations @xcite for @xmath206ni in comparison with results from ref.@xcite chosen as a representative of the currently most advanced relativistic mean field phenomenolgy .",
    "examples of charge distributions and form factors are displayed in fig.11 .",
    "these calculations include center - of - mass corrections and convolution with the empirical proton form factor .",
    "the direct comparison with experimental data is evidently quite successful , considering that the detailed surface structure of these distributions is reproduced using the gradient terms derived from chiral pion dynamics , with no additional fine - tuning required .",
    "it is instructive to summarise the trends in the equivalent scalar and vector self - energies for symmetric nuclear matter , reconstructed using the optimised coupling strengths @xmath196 found in the overall `` best fit '' to finite nuclei .",
    "these self - energies have the following approximate pattern ( with @xmath171 @xmath4 ) : @xmath207\\ ] ] where @xmath208 gev and @xmath209 gev just balance to zero in their summed contribution to the single particle potential but act coherently in producing the large spin - orbit splitting .",
    "these pieces are compatible with the scalar and vector background fields derived from in - medium qcd sum rules . the additional part linear in the density @xmath136 results from contact terms ( subtraction constants ) in the in - medium chpt calculation .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath210 and @xmath211 are directly deduced from chiral pion dynamics without tuning , while the correction of order @xmath212 , representing genuine three - body effects and higher order contributions , is subject to adjustment .    although the expansion ( 24 ) is perturbative by construction , it is a non - trivial feature that the detailed density dependence of the nucleon scalar and vector self - energies as obtained in ref.@xcite follows very closely , over a wide range of densities , the results of dirac - brueckner g - matrix calculations @xcite which start from a realistic boson - exchange nn interaction .",
    "the reasoning behind this observation can presumably be traced to the separation of scales at work , a key element of chiral effective field theory which motivates the present approach .",
    "one- and two - pion exchange in - medium dynamics at momentum scales around @xmath86 are treated explicitly and include all terms ( ladders and others ) to three - loop order in the energy density .",
    "the non - trivial @xmath86 dependence in the self - energies ( beyond `` trivial '' order @xmath127 ) reflects in large part the action of the pauli principle in these processes .",
    "such features are also present in the brueckner ladder summation which includes , for example , pauli blocking effects on iterated one - pion exchange .",
    "these model - independent terms produce the characteristic @xmath138 ( or equivalently , @xmath210 ) behaviour in the energy per particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the iteration of the short - distance pieces of the nn potential to all orders in the brueckner ladder , involves intermediate momenta much larger than @xmath86 and gets absorbed in contact terms which produce self - energy pieces linear in the density . note that these contact interactions must _ not _ be iterated further since they already represent the full short - distance t - matrix information",
    "the aim of this presentation has been to demonstrate the key role in the structure of nucleons and nuclei played by a guiding principle that governs low - energy qcd : spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . the effective field theory based on this principle ties together a wide range of strong - interaction phenomena involving the lightest ( @xmath213 and @xmath214)quarks : from the low - energy interactions of pions and nucleons via the condensate structure of the qcd vacuum to basic aspects of nuclear binding and saturation .",
    "we are on the way to a relativistic nuclear energy density functional constrained by low - energy qcd . at the least",
    ", these constraints significantly reduce the freedom in the choice of parameters . in this approach ,",
    "nuclear binding and saturation arises from the van der waals - nature of chiral two - pion exchange forces combined with the pauli principle .",
    "strong scalar and vector mean fields , expected to emerge from in - medium changes of qcd condensates , largely cancel in the energy per nucleon but drive the spin - orbit splitting in finite nuclei .",
    "the genuine isospin dependence of interactions produced by chiral pion - nucleon dynamics offers interesting perspectives for extrapolations to nuclear systems with extreme isospins .",
    "a further step , presently taken @xcite , is the extension of this framework to chiral su(3 ) dynamics and its application to hypernuclei . +",
