    "[ f : input ] .",
    "however , all simulations show the same correlation signatures when passed through the experimental filter .",
    "the insensitivity of the results to the decay mode is due to the uncertainty in the momentum of the @xmath3o at the reaction point in the target and the near threshold energy of the @xmath0o ground - state resonance .",
    "the jacobi variables , which describe the three - body correlations , are directly related to the relative momenta of the particles in the decay . when the decay energy is very low , the relative momentum between the particles is then very small .",

    "the results are shown ( a ) with and ( b ) without the inclusion of the experimental incoming beam characteristics in the simulations.,scaledwidth=31.0% ]    the uncertainty in the momentum of the @xmath3o stems mainly from two factors : ( 1 ) the uncertainty in the position at which the @xmath2f(@xmath59 ) reaction occurs within the target and ( 2 ) the size and angular spread of the incoming beam . while the momentum , or @xmath60 , of the outgoing @xmath3o is defined by the path of the fragment through the sweeper magnet , the momentum at the reaction point requires the location of the reaction in the target to be known so that the energy - loss within the target can be accurately calculated .",
    "since the reaction location is unknown , it was assumed that the reaction took place at the mid - point of the target in the present analysis . in fig .",
    "[ f : comp](a ) , the effect of the target thickness is shown .",
    "for a 200  kev resonance , decreasing the target thickness from 705  mg/@xmath31 to 0.5  mg/@xmath31 improves the agreement between the results of the simulation and the input hagino distribution .",
    "however , decreasing the target thickness does not improve the results when @xmath48  =  5  kev and the dineutron signature still prevails .",
    "this is due to the characteristics of the incoming @xmath2f beam which can produce uncertainties in the @xmath60 analysis of the @xmath3o through the sweeper magnet .",
    "again , if the decay energy of @xmath0o is near threshold any uncertainty in the @xmath3o momentum is magnified in the three - body correlations . from the experiment , the beam spot on the target was estimated to be 5  mm x 5  mm and the incoming angular distribution of the beam was approximated as a gaussian distribution with a mean of 0@xmath29 and @xmath61  =  7  mrad ( 2  mrad ) in the dispersive ( non - dispersive ) direction . these deviations from an ideal beam could be corrected event - by - event using tracking detectors upstream of the target , however such detectors were not available for the present experiment .",

    "the results from the simulation , therefore , indicate that an experimental measurement sensitive to the angular and energy correlations in the three body decay of @xmath0o will be extremely difficult assuming the ground state resonance is near threshold .",
    "even with an increased @xmath2f beam rate , the use of a 0.5  mg/@xmath31 target would pose a significant challenge in obtaining the required statistics to identify the decay mode of @xmath0o . while future experiments will likely encounter a similar situation ,",
    "it is important to emphasis that these results and sensitivity studies are specific to the present experiment and mona - sweeper setup .",
