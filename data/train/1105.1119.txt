    "the vista variables in the va lctea ( vvv ) eso public survey[multiblock footnote omitted ] is an infrared variability survey of the milky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid - plane where star formation activity is high @xcite .",
    "the survey is carried out on eso s visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) 4 m telescope , which is equipped with a wide - field near - infrared ( ir ) camera ( vircam ; dalton et al . 2006 ) that is a mosaic of 16 @xmath5 detectors , each sensitive over the spectral region @xmath6 , and with an average pixel scale of @xmath7 .",

    "the final products will be a deep ir atlas in 5 passbands and a catalogue containing an estimated @xmath3 variable stars .",
    "the synergy with other surveys that provide optical , mid - ir , and far - ir data is also worth noting , including ukidss gps , iphas , vphas+ , the spitzer , glimpse , and mipsgal surveys , and the all - sky akari and wise surveys .",
    "the scientific goals of the vvv survey are described in great detail in @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals is to gain insight into the inner milky way s origin , structure , and evolution .",
    "this will be achieved by , for instance , obtaining a first , precise 3d map of the galactic bulge , whose detailed shape appears to be quite complex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of particular importance , in order to achieve this goal , will be the rr lyrae stars .",
    "not only are the rr lyrae variables present in the direction of the bulge in great numbers @xcite , but they also follow precise period - luminosity relations in the near - ir bandpasses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , being very old , they are `` living eyewitnesses '' of virtually the entire formation history of the milky way ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "another important goal of the vvv survey is the discovery of globular clusters , open clusters , and stellar associations which have heretofore remained `` hidden '' from view behind the high extinction regions towards the inner galaxy . in this paper",

    "this means that vvv observations for eso period 86 will not be completed as expected , likely leading to an extension of our original 5-year goal for completion of the project .",

    "6 pawprints with proper offsets are acquired in succession , in order to provide a contiguous sampling of a sky area ; stacks of these images are called `` tiles . ''",

    "the time between the acquisition of two consecutive pawprints that correspond to the same tile is much shorter than the timescale of the light variation for the most typical variable stars that will be detected in the course of the vvv survey .",
    "therefore , these successive observations carry information about the internal scatter of each individual photometric time - series .",

    "2010 version ) as high as @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , in spite of using near - ir bandpasses , the cluster sequences are still severely distorted by differential reddening .",
    "the fact that the vvv survey utilizes a set of 5 different broadband filters allows us to explore the possibility of devising reddening - free indices , which can be very important for the studies of regions of high extinction ( as is normally the case for the bulge and inner disk regions probed by this survey ) . to obtain such a set of reddening - free indices , we proceed as follows .",

    "in addition , the intrinsic range in values ( in mag units ) covered by different cmd features can be significantly reduced , with respect to that seen in the original cmds . therefore , in order for clear - cut sequences to show up in such reddening - free diagrams , the internal precision must be significantly higher than what is needed for similar such sequences to be seen in the original cmds .",
    "note also that errors in the calibrations , particularly in the color terms , may also contribute to smearing up features that might otherwise show up well in such reddening - free diagrams .",

    "this has been mainly triggered by the ongoing and future large - scale observational surveys , which are expected to deliver huge amounts of high - quality data , which will need to be promptly analyzed and classified .",
    "an illustrative example of such a need is indeed the vvv survey , whose final product will be a deep near - ir atlas in five passbands and a catalog with an estimated more than @xmath98 variable point sources @xcite .",
    "since the majority of these surveys will deal with temporal series , it is natural that most of the effort for developing , adapting and testing such automated classification algorithms has concentrated on the field of variable stars .",
    "the reference work in machine learning applied to variable star classification can be considered the paper by @xcite , in which the authors explored several classification techniques , quantitatively comparing performance ( e.g. , in terms of computational time ) and final results ( e.g. , in terms of accuracy ) .",
    "more recently , a few other studies have focused on specific methodologies , with the implicit goal of finding the best compromise between robustness and speed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "irrespective of the specific algorithm , the general idea behind these `` supervised machine learning '' methodologies is to create a function , _ the classifier _ , that is able to infer the most probable _ label _ for an object   in our case , the variability class to which an unclassified variable star belongs to   on the basis of what is learned by the analysis of the _ inputs _   in our case , light curve features , including , for instance , periods , fourier decomposition parameters , colors , etc .   from a _ training set_. the latter , in our case , is a collection of high - quality light curves of independently classified variable stars   the _ templates_.     , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in this sense , in @xcite we show that a significant improvement in the automated classification of astronomical data can be achieved from an optimization of the way _ the training set itself _ is selected .",
    "this is of crucial importance for our purposes , given that the many hundreds of light curve templates that optical automated classification studies can rely upon ( see , e.g. , table  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not yet available in the near - ir , and will likely   despite our best efforts   not be available in comparable numbers in the near future . given the availability of such huge template datasets , the precise way in which the training set itself is optimized has never been a major concern in optical studies , but is instead an important aspect of our near - ir automated classification work that must be carefully addressed .",
    "in fact , there are concrete cases in which it is convenient to keep the training set as small as possible , while still retaining its maximum information content . for example",
    ", one may need to classify _ as quickly as possible _ huge amounts of data obtained in `` real - time , '' such as the 30  tb of data produced every night by lsst @xcite .",
    "we might also be in the situation for which gathering a training set may be far from straightforward , as in the case of the vvv survey . in all these cases , an active learning approach can be the key to the problem",
    ".    active learning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : altemplates ] ) is a form of supervised machine learning in which the learning algorithm is able to interactively query the user ( or some other information source ) .",
    "the key hypothesis is that if the learning algorithm is allowed to choose the data from which it learns , it will perform better with less training . in other words",
    ", the active learner aims to achieve high accuracy using as few ( in our case ) template light curves as possible , thereby minimizing the cost of obtaining observational data .",
    "active learning is thus fully justified in many modern machine learning problems where unlabeled data may be abundant ( in our case , e.g. , the @xmath9 point sources in the vvv survey catalog ) , but labels ( i.e. , template light curves ) are scarce or expensive to obtain .",
    "this is the technique that we eventually plan to implement , in order to properly carry out the automated classification of vvv light curves @xcite .",
    "the vvv survey of the galactic bulge and inner disk , which has recently started its second year of observations , represents a treasure trove for many different types of studies .",
    "its final data products will include a deep , multi - band catalog containing of order @xmath9 point sources in the @xmath1 filters , in addition to near - ir light curves for an estimated @xmath98 variable stars in the surveyed fields . in this contribution",
    ", we have provided an overview of the project s main scientific goals and present status .",
    "we have also highlighted some of the first scientific results that have been obtained on the basis of its first year of operation , including the discovery of a number of previously unknown globular clusters , open clusters , and stellar associations .",
    "deep color - magnitude diagrams for a few selected systems were presented , and a set of reddening - free indices for analysis of heavily differentially obscured regions introduced .",
    "@xmath31-band light curves for a few variable stars in the vista science verification field were also presented .",
    "finally , we provided an overview of the vvv templates project , whose aim is to provide high - quality light curves for the automated classification of vvv near - ir light curves . in this framework",
    ", we also argued that active learning may represent an ideal technique for classifying the vvv light curves on the basis of the template set that we are currently building .",
