    "chemotaxis is a process by which cells change their state of movement reacting to the presence of a chemical substance , approaching chemically favorable environments and avoiding unfavorable ones . in the simple situation where we only consider cells and a chemical substance ( the chemo - attractant ) , a model for the space and time evolution of the density @xmath0 of cells and the chemical concentration @xmath1 at time @xmath2 and position",
    "@xmath3 has been introduced by patlak @xcite and keller - segel @xcite reads : @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the gradient with respect to the spatial variable , and the positive constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the diffusivity of the chemo - attractant and of the cells , respectively , and @xmath8 is the chemotactic sensitivity .    in general",
    "the substance @xmath9 does not only diffuse in the substrate , but it can also be produced by the bacteria themselves .",
    "the role of the function @xmath10 is to describe the interaction between both quantities .",
    "one typical example is given by @xmath11 which describes the production of the chemo - attractant by the bacteria at a constant rate @xmath12 as well as chemical decay with relaxation time @xmath13 .",
    "since the bacterial movement is directed toward the higher concentrations of @xmath9 , the coupling is attractive .",
    "a deep insight into the phenomenological derivation of keller and segel types models is given in the survey @xcite .",
    "the behavior of this system is now quite wellknown : in the one - dimensional case , the solution is always global in time . in several space dimensions ,",
    "if initial data are small enough in some norms , the solution will be global in time and rapidly decaying in time ; while on the opposite , it will explode in finite time at least for some large initial data .",
    "the simplicity , the analytical tractability , and the capacity to replicate some of the key behaviors of chemotactic populations are the main reasons of the success of this model of chemotaxis .",
    "in particular , the ability to display auto - aggregation , has led to its prominence as a mechanism for self - organization of biological systems .",
    "moreover , there exists a lot of variations of system ( [ ma ] ) to describe biological processes in which chemotaxis is involved .",
    "they differ in the functional forms of the three main mechanisms involved in the chemotactical movement .",
    "they are : the sensing of the chemoattractant , which has an effect on the oriented movement of the species , the production of the chemoattractant by a mobile species or an external source , and the degradation of the chemoattractant by a mobile species or an external effect .",
    "the surveys @xcite and @xcite provide a detailed review and critical analysis of the qualitative properties of the solutions to problems related to the application of keller and segel models to various biological contexts .",
    "another point of view was introduced by a mesoscopic description of these phenomena bridging from stochastic interacting particle systems to macroscopic equations .",
    "this middle ground consists in describing the movement of cells by a `` run & tumble '' process @xcite .",
    "the cells move along a straight line in the running phase and make reorientation as a reaction to the surrounding chemicals during the tumbling phase .",
    "this is the typical behavior that has been observed in experiments .",
    "the resulting nondimensionalized kinetic equation , with parabolic rescaling , reads    @xmath14    where @xmath15 denotes the density of cells , depending on time @xmath2 , position @xmath16 and velocity @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is an operator , which models the change of direction of cells and @xmath19 is a time scale which here refers to the turning frequency .",
    "the function @xmath20 is the chemical concentration , where @xmath21 denotes the density of cells , and is given by @xmath22    starting with the kinetic equation ( [ ki ] ) , one can ( at least formally ) derive the macroscopic limit ( [ ma ] ) as @xmath23 .",
    "the details will be described in section 3 .",
    "other asymptotic limits , such as the hyperbolic limits have been investigated in refs @xcite .",
    "the general context of this paper is the development of numerical schemes for solving the kinetic equation that are uniformly stable along the transition from kinetic regime to the fluid regime .",
    "the main difficulty is due to the term @xmath24 which becomes stiff when @xmath19 is close to zero ( macroscopic regime ) . in this case , solving the kinetic equation by a standard explicit numerical scheme requires the use of a time step of the order of @xmath19 , which leads to very expensive numerical computations for small @xmath19 . to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "it is necessary to use an implicit or semi - implicit time discretization for the collision part .",
    "in fact , such numerical schemes should also have a correct asymptotic behavior : for small parameter @xmath19 , the schemes should degenerate into a good approximation of the asymptotics ( keller - segel model ) of the kinetic equation .",
    "this property is often called `` asymptotic preserving '' , and has been introduced in @xcite for numerical schemes that are stable with respect to a small parameter @xmath19 and degenerate into a consistent numerical scheme for the limit model when @xmath25 .    considering that this paper deals with asymptotic preserving scheme ( ap ) , one also has to mention that there are different approaches to construct such schemes for kinetic models in various contexts .",
    "we mention for instance works based on domain decompositions , separating the macroscopic ( fluid ) domain from the microscopic ( kinetic ) one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is another kind of ( ap ) schemes for kinetic equations , which are based on the use of time relaxed techniques where the boltzmann collision operator is discretized by a spectral or a monte - carlo method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other techniques have also been developed to design multiscale numerical methods which are based on splitting strategy @xcite , penalization procedure @xcite or micro - macro decomposition which first was used by liu and yu for theoretical study of the fluid limit of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "it was then used to develop an ap scheme for different asymptotics ( diffusion , fluid , high - field , ... ) , see @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we extend a method of micro - macro decomposition in order to construct asymptotic preserving schemes ( ap ) for kinetic equations describing chemotaxis phenomena .",
    "our strategy consists in rewriting the kinetic equation as a coupled system of kinetic part and macroscopic one , by using the micro - macro decomposition of the distribution function .",
    "indeed , this function is decomposed into its corresponding equilibrium distribution plus the deviation . by using a classical projection technique ,",
    "we obtain an evolution equation for the macroscopic parameters of the equilibrium coupled to a kinetic equation for the non - equilibrium part .",
    "although our approach is rather general to apply to a very large class of collision operators , the numerical tests shown in our work were obtained with very simple model .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sect .",
    "2 , we present the kinetic model and its properties . the micro - macro decomposition , the corresponding formulation of the kinetic equation , and the macroscopic limit are presented in sect .",
    "our numerical scheme is presented in sect .",
    "finally , our method is demonstrated with a numerical tests in sect .",

    "we first mention some assumptions on the turning operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 :    * the operators @xmath33 and @xmath35 preserve the local mass : @xmath36 for any @xmath37 .",

    "the kernel @xmath42 is bounded , and there exists a constant @xmath43 such that @xmath44    the most commonly used assumption on the turning operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is that they are both linear integral operators with respect to @xmath47 and read : @xmath48    here the turning kernel @xmath49 describes the reorientation of cells , i.e. the random velocity changes from @xmath29 to @xmath28 and may depend on the chemo - attractant concentration and its derivatives .",

    "moreover , for @xmath53 , eq.([est ] ) and the estimate ( [ t ] ) yield the following inequality : @xmath54 which shows that @xmath33 is a fredholm operator in the space @xmath55 . therefore , the following result defines the properties of the operator @xmath33 :    [ le1 ] suppose that assumptions ( [ m])-([t ] ) hold .",
    "then , the following properties of the operators @xmath33 hold true :    * the operator @xmath33 is self - adjoint in the space @xmath56 . * for @xmath57 ,",
