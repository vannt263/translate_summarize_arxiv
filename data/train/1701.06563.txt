    "the spectral slope optical / uv variations in agns have been quantified by @xcite , by means of the _ spectral variability parameter _ @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the slope of the spectrum and @xmath2 its flux in the given band .",
    "a positive value was found , which means that the spectrum is harder when the flux is higher .",
    "+ however , in the x - ray band , the opposite behaviour has been found for individual sources , and very few systematic studies have been performed , e.g. @xcite , who found this trend for a sample of 10 nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "+ in our study we investigated the spectral variability of quasars , using the mexsas catalogue @xcite , created cross - matching the multi - epoch observations of the xmm - newton serendipitous source catalogue , data release 5 @xcite with two partially overlapping sloan digital sky survey catalogues , sdss - dr7q @xcite and sdss - dr12q @xcite , obtaining a catalogue of 7,837 x - ray observations of 2,700 quasar sources .",
    "in order to study the spectral variability in the x - ray band , we redefine the spectral variability parameter in terms of the photon index @xmath3 , defined after @xmath4 .",
    "then , the spectral variability parameter becomes @xmath5 , since @xmath6 . in order to better compare sources we computed the linear fit between the variations of @xmath3 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 in band @xmath9kev ) from the source mean values .",
    "the computed spectral variability parameter is @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ensemble ] ) .",
    "a negative @xmath11 implies that the spectral slope becomes higher for increasing flux , making the spectrum steeper .",
    "this means that the spectrum is softer when brighter .",
    "+ we tried to investigate the dependence of @xmath11 from some source parameters , such as black hole mass , eddington ratio , redshift and x - ray luminosity , finding no evidence of such dependence .",
    "the value of @xmath11 in some bins deviates significantly from the ensemble value , though , suggesting that different sources may have different values of @xmath11 between each other .",
    "therefore we studied single sources , selecting the ones with low probability of finding a @xmath12 correlation by chance ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we find all negative @xmath11s in a wide range of values , from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "( band @xmath9kev ) correlation of the whole sample . ]",
    "the softer when brighter trend , found in both the ensemble and single - source analysis , may be caused by the superposition of the primary x - ray emission with an additional reflected component .",
    "according to some models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the primary emission could be variable in flux , but not in spectrum , while the constant reflected component is not variable at all , producing the observed spectra .",
    "other models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest that the primary component may be variable in spectrum as well .",
    "+ as for the single source analysis , the wide range of @xmath11 values may be dependent on several unconsidered features of the source , such as black hole spin , angle of view or radio - loudness , or it may be influenced by stochastic processes .",

    "<S> variations of the x - ray spectral slope have been found in many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at moderate luminosities and redshifts , typically showing a `` softer when brighter '' behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> however , similar studies are not usually performed for high - luminosity agns . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analysis of the spectral variability based on a large sample of quasars in wide intervals of luminosity and redshift , measured at several different epochs , extracted from the fifth release of the xmm newton serendipitous source catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis confirms a `` softer when brighter '' trend also for our sample , extending to high luminosity and redshift the general behaviour previously found . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be understood in light of current spectral models , such as intrinsic variations of the x - ray primary radiation , or superposition with a constant reflection component . </S>"
