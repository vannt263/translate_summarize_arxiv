    "this paper is concerned with a homogenous fragmentation process in which there is an additional killing upon crossing a certain space - time barrier ( this killing mechanism is defined rigorously in section  [ s.killed_fragmentations ] ) . in particular , we consider the decay of the largest fragment in this process with killing .",
    "the motivation for the killing procedure that we introduce in the present paper , partly stems from its relation to the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovskii - piskounov ( fkpp ) equation . in the context of fragmentation",
    "processes this connection is studied in a forthcoming paper by the first author .",
    "the role an analogous killing plays with regard to solutions of the fkpp equation in the setting of branching brownian motions ( bbm ) was investigated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this kind of killing for random multi - particle systems was considered also in various other contexts and in the literature there is some interesting recent activity in this regard .",
    "the killing of bbm at a linear space - time barrier was also studied in @xcite and recently in @xcite , where a relation of the killed bbm and its genealogy to continuous - state branching processes and the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent was revealed . regarding a similar killing scheme for branching random walks we refer e.g. to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the context of fragmentation processes",
    "such a killing mechanism has not been considered so far . however , the above - mentioned papers which are concerned with related types of spatial branching processes suggest that this kind of killing has interesting applications .",
    "we begin our exposition by briefly reviewing what is meant by a homogenous fragmentation process , thereby introducing some notation .",
    "below we give a brief overview of the definition and structure of a homogenous fragmentation process .",
    "the reader is referred to bertoin @xcite for a more concise overview .",
    "let @xmath0 be the space of partitions of the natural numbers . here",
    "a partition of @xmath1 is a sequence @xmath2 of disjoint sets , called blocks , such that @xmath3 .",
    "the blocks of a partition are enumerated in the increasing order of their least element , that is to say @xmath4 when @xmath5 ( with the convention that @xmath6 ) .",
    "now consider the measure @xmath7 on @xmath0 , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the law of kingman s paint - box based on @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "p98 of bertoin @xcite ) with @xmath11 and the so - called _ dislocation measure _ @xmath12 is a measure on @xmath13 such that @xmath14 as well as @xmath15 it is known that @xmath7 is an exchangeable partition measure , meaning that it is invariant under the action of finite permutations on @xmath0 .",
    "it is also known ( cf .",
    "chapter 3 of bertoin @xcite ) that it is possible to construct a fragmentation process on the space of partitions @xmath0 with the help of a poisson point process @xmath16 on @xmath17 which has intensity measure @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the counting measure .",
    "the aforementioned @xmath0-valued fragmentation process is a markov process which we denote by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is such that at all times @xmath22 for which an atom @xmath23 occurs in @xmath24 , @xmath25 is obtained from @xmath26 by partitioning the @xmath27-th block into the sub - blocks @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 is a finite measure each block experiences an exponential holding time before it fragments .",
    "thanks to the properties of the exchangeable partition measure @xmath7 it can be shown that for each @xmath30 the distribution of @xmath25 is exchangeable and moreover , blocks of @xmath25 have asymptotic frequencies in the sense that for each @xmath31 , @xmath32 exists almost surely .",
    "we denote the countable random jump times of @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "further , let @xmath35 denote the filtration generated by @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath36 be the sub ",
    "filtration generated by the asymptotic frequencies of @xmath33 and let @xmath37 denote the filtration generated by @xmath38 .",
    "let us define @xmath39 for every @xmath30 .",
    "resorting to the poissonian construction of the fragmentation process , bertoin proved that @xmath40 is a killed subordinator with cemetery state @xmath41 and killing rate @xmath42 moreover , it is well known that its laplace exponent @xmath43 , given by @xmath44 can be characterised over an appropriate domain of @xmath45 through the dislocation measure @xmath29 as follows .",
    "define the constant @xmath46 which is necessarily in @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "the tagged fragment @xmath50 , and in particular its laplace exponent @xmath43 , can be used to extract information about the decay and spatial distribution of blocks in the fragmentation process . a case in point concerns the asymptotic rate of decay of the largest block @xmath51 to this end , note that @xmath43 is strictly increasing , concave and differentiable .",
    "the equation @xmath52 for @xmath53 is known to have a unique solution in @xmath54 which we shall denote by @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "lemma  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 when @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the function @xmath58 reaches its unique maximum on @xmath59 at @xmath55 .",
    "this maximal value turns out to characterise the asymptotic rate of decay of the largest block , as shown in the following proposition that is lifted from bertoin @xcite .",
    "[ largestfragmentnotkilled ] we have @xmath60 @xmath61almost surely .    in corollary  1.4 of @xcite",
    "bertoin proves this result for fragmentation chains , but in view of lemma  1.35 of @xcite the same arguments work for fragmentation processes .",
    "now let @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we want to introduce killing of @xmath33 upon hitting the space  time barrier @xmath64 as follows .",
    "a block @xmath65 is killed at the moment of its creation @xmath66 if @xmath67 , see figure  [ f.kfp.1 ] . here , killing",
    "a block means that it is sent to a _ cemetery state _ , which we shall identify by @xmath68 .",
    "suppose that for @xmath30 we define @xmath69 to be the index set of the blocks @xmath70 that are not yet killed by time @xmath71 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath72 is finite for each @xmath71 . indeed , as @xmath73 we infer that @xmath74 for at most @xmath75many @xmath76 .",
    "that is @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "denote by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , the resulting killed fragmentation process and note that @xmath81 is not @xmath0-valued .",
    "if we re - assign the indices of the blocks in @xmath82 so that the ordering is given by the least element of each block relative to the set of natural numbers found in @xmath83 rather than the whole of @xmath1 , then we shall notationally identify @xmath83 as @xmath84 , where necessarily we have @xmath85 for @xmath86 .    for each @xmath76 the block of @xmath81 containing @xmath87 has a killing time that may be finite or infinite .",
    "note that the killed fragmentation process @xmath81 also depends on the constant @xmath62 .",
    "however , in order to keep the notation as simple as possible we do not include the parameter @xmath88 in the notation as this constant does not change within the results or proofs of this paper .    in this paper we shall answer the question whether it is possible that the supremum over all the aforementioned respective individual killing times , which is henceforth denoted by @xmath89 , is finite .",
    "we say that @xmath81 becomes _ extinct _ if @xmath90 .",
    "our first main result in this respect is the following .",
    "[ p.ext-probab ] for all @xmath91 we have @xmath92 for every @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath93 , then @xmath94 is a nonincreasing , @xmath95valued function on @xmath96 .    in the case",
    "that extinction does not occur with probability 1 , we shall give two qualitative results concerning the evolution of the process on survival .",
    "the first result shows that the total number of fragments in the surviving process explodes .",
    "[ l.p.2.2 ] let @xmath93 .",
    "then we have that @xmath97 holds @xmath98a.s . for any @xmath63 .",
    "the second result shows that the asymptotic exponential rate of decay of the largest fragment , @xmath99 is the same as when the killing scheme is not in effect , cf .",

    "[ l.fp.1 ] let @xmath93 and @xmath63 .",
    "then we have @xmath100 @xmath98almost surely .",
    "what lies fundamentally behind the proofs of our main results is a detailed study of the interaction between two classes of martingales .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section we provide some general notions that are used in the subsequent parts of the present paper and in particular we employ the connection between fragmentations and lvy processes .",
    "section  [ s.properties ] is concerned with the proof of theorem  [ p.ext-probab ] and in section  [ proof of l.p.2.2 ] we provide the proof of theorem  [ l.p.2.2 ] .",
    "then , in section  [ s.mm ] , we introduce a multiplicative process and examine when this process is a martingale .",
    "the object under consideration in section  [ s.am ] is an additive process which also turns out to be a martingale and whose limit we study with regard to strict positivity . in the final section of this paper",
    "we prove theorem  [ l.fp.1 ] .",
    "let @xmath101 , @xmath78 , denote the block in @xmath25 that contains the element @xmath76 and recall from ( [ e.kappa ] ) that under @xmath61 the process @xmath102 is a killed subordinator ( with cemetery state @xmath41 and killing rate @xmath103 ) .    for every @xmath76 let the process @xmath104[p.xn ] be defined by @xmath105 for all @xmath78 .",
    "notice that under @xmath61 the dynamics of the process @xmath106 are those of a killed spectrally negative lvy process of bounded variation ( with cemetery state @xmath107 and killing rate @xmath103 ) .",
    "moreover , the jump times of @xmath106 , henceforth denoted by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is an at most countably infinite index set , are the set of dislocation times of @xmath110 .",

    "see lemma  1.35 of @xcite ( or theorem 2 of @xcite for the conservative case ) . consequently , restricted to the @xmath129algebra @xmath130 , the measures @xmath125 and @xmath61 are equivalent .",
    "corollary  3.10 in @xcite shows that under the measure @xmath125 the process @xmath117 is again a spectrally negative lvy process such that @xmath131 for all @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath133[p.w_p ] be the scale function of the spectrally negative lvy process @xmath117 under @xmath125 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath133 is the unique non - decreasing continuous function on @xmath134 that is defined through the laplace transform @xmath135 for all sufficiently large @xmath136 .",
    "a fundamental identity involving the scale function @xmath133 that we shall appeal to later is the following result taken from theorem 8.1 , equation ( 8.7 ) , in @xcite .",
    "@xmath137 for all @xmath138 .",
    "another important fact that we shall also use concerns the value of @xmath133 at zero . indeed , thanks to the fact that @xmath117 has paths of bounded variation , it turns out that for all @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",

' '' ''    notice that the statement of the previous lemma is obvious for @xmath157 as the asymptotic speed of the largest fragment in the non  killed setting is given by @xmath158 , see proposition  [ largestfragmentnotkilled ] , and thus the fragmentation process eventually crosses the killing line almost surely .",
    "however , for the critical value @xmath159 this argument does not work as one needs to rule out the possibility that the largest fragment could approach the killing line without intersecting it .",
    "the following result deals with the more interesting case that @xmath93 .",
