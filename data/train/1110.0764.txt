    "we will focus on penner s approach , following hamenstad s notation @xcite .",
    "we will define train tracks and some other related notions , so as to be able to define the symplectic form .",
    "then we will present an easy way to calculate it .    a _ train track _ on the surface @xmath0 is an embedded 1complex @xmath134 whose edges ( called _ branches _ ) are smooth arcs with well  defined tangent vectors at the endpoints . at any vertex ( called a _ switch _ ) the incident edges are mutually tangent . through each switch",
    "there is a path of class @xmath135 which is embedded in @xmath136 and contains the switch in its interior .",
    "in particular , the branches which are incident on a fixed switch are divided into  incoming \" and  outgoing \" branches according to their inward pointing tangent vectors at the switch .",
    "each closed curve component of @xmath136 has a unique bivalent switch , and all other switches are at least trivalent .",
    "the complementary regions of the train track have negative euler characteristic , which means that they are different from discs with 0 , 1 or 2 cusps at the boundary and different from annuli and once - punctured discs with no cusps at the boundary .",
    "a train track is called _ generic _ if all switches are at most trivalent .",

    "now we would like to describe how to solve these equations simultaneously for @xmath501 .",
    "following the analysis in section 7 of @xcite , we recall that for any curve @xmath502 we have @xmath503 where @xmath504 and @xmath505 with @xmath506 as above .",
    "we will use linear algebra and thurston s symplectic form @xmath507 to solve the equations @xmath508 for all @xmath493 and for @xmath500 . as already noted in section [ ssub : sympl ] , this symplectic form induces a map @xmath171 defined by @xmath509 such that @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the usual inner product on @xmath175    we need the following lemma , which generalise lemma 7.2 of @xcite .",
    "see section 2.6 of penner @xcite for a definition of _ standard _ train tracks .",
    "note that , although not necessary , we will use the language of the curve and marking complexes , since many readers may find it useful .",
    "see section [ ssub : complex ] for the basic definitions .",
    "* suppose that @xmath510 is a simplex in the complex of curves @xmath192",
    ". then @xmath418 are supported on a common standard train track and @xmath511 are independent vectors in @xmath512 . *",
    "given any simplex @xmath510 in the complex of curves @xmath192 , we can find curves @xmath513 , @xmath514 such that the elements @xmath515 and @xmath516 with @xmath517 , are simplices in @xmath192 and such that the vectors @xmath518 , @xmath519 span a subspace of real dimension @xmath520 in @xmath512 .",
    "@xmath521 : following series proof , the disjointness of the curves @xmath522 tells us they are supported on a common standard train track .",
    "the second part of @xmath523 is proved , as a particular case , in the proof of @xmath523 .",
    "@xmath523 : the idea is to complete @xmath524 to a pants decomposition of @xmath0 and to consider the dual curves of the pants curves added . in detail let @xmath525 be such that @xmath526 is a pants decomposition of @xmath0 and let @xmath527 be the dual curve of @xmath207 .",
    "( note that @xmath527 is disjoint from any pants curve @xmath528 when @xmath205 and intersects @xmath529 twice . ) using the language of masur and minsky @xcite , we can say we have chosen a complete , clean marking @xmath530 ( that is a vertex in the marking complex where @xmath531 are curves in the base of @xmath202 ) and we define a path @xmath532 by the requirement @xmath533 is obtained from @xmath534 by flipping @xmath535 and @xmath536 for @xmath537 .",
    "the simplices in the statement of the theorem are then the bases of the markings @xmath538 for @xmath539 .",
    "we want to show that the vectors @xmath518 , @xmath519 are linear independent . without loss of generality , we can assume the map @xmath540 is defined with respect to the marking @xmath541 .",
    "indeed , if that it is not the case , the change of coordinates between the map @xmath540 and a new map @xmath542 defined with respect to a new marking @xmath543 is a linear map , which does nt change our conclusion about the linear independence of the vectors . now the vector @xmath544 is defined by @xmath545 and @xmath546 for all @xmath205 and the vector @xmath547 is defined by @xmath548 and @xmath549 for all @xmath205 .",
    "( see remark [ dual ] for a description of the convention on dual curves that we are using . )",
    "this proves that the vectors @xmath550 are linearly independent .",
    "[ ta ] suppose that @xmath489 is admissible ( and @xmath551 ) .",
    "let @xmath552 .",
    "let @xmath553 be the line @xmath554 where @xmath555 let @xmath556 be the point corresponding to the group @xmath557 with @xmath448 , so that the pleating ray @xmath558 is the image of the map @xmath559 for a suitable range of @xmath560",
    ". then @xmath69 approaches @xmath561 as @xmath449 in the sense that if @xmath562 , then @xmath563    note that here , in contrast to the approach followed by series in @xcite , we do not need to exclude from our statements the case of ` exceptional curves ' and to be dealt with separately . for completeness",
    ", we include a definition of exceptional curves , but the interested reader should see @xcite for a deeper discussion .",
    "we will use the previous notation , that is we will write @xmath566 , and @xmath481 , where the dependence on @xmath39 is clear . by theorem  [ prop6_1 ] , we have @xmath567 . on the other hand , with @xmath568 as in the statement of the theorem , we find @xmath569 .",
    "thus for @xmath570 we have @xmath571 as @xmath449 , as we wanted to prove .",
    "now , let s deal with the coordinates @xmath572 .",
    "given @xmath573 , let @xmath513 , @xmath574 the curves defined by lemma [ pants ] . if @xmath575 , then the curves @xmath576 , @xmath574 are all bending lines of @xmath577 .",
    "it follows , that @xmath578 for @xmath579 and @xmath580 .",
    "so , by proposition [ prop7_1 ] , it follows that @xmath581 for @xmath582 . defining @xmath583 and regarding these as equations in @xmath181 for a parameter @xmath584 ,",
    "where @xmath585 we have , for @xmath586 , @xmath587 by theorem [ disj ] , we have @xmath588 for @xmath500 for any @xmath589 .",
    "hence @xmath590 for @xmath500 and for all @xmath591 .",
    "since @xmath518 , @xmath519 are independent , it follows that we can write @xmath592 where @xmath593 is in the linear span of @xmath518 , @xmath519 and @xmath594 .",
    "using we find that @xmath595 ( where the constants depend on @xmath518 , @xmath519 ) .",
    "then @xmath596 for @xmath500 gives @xmath597 .",
    "equating the two sides of   gives @xmath598 so we proved @xmath599 belongs to the @xmath193dimensional subspace @xmath600 generated by @xmath601 .",
    "now we want to prove @xmath599 is approximately parallel to the vector @xmath602 , that is @xmath603 is proportional to @xmath604 . to do this , and to avoid the restriction to non exceptional curves , we modify slightly series approach .",
    "we can now put this information together as : @xmath606 where we defined @xmath607 in order to keep the notation more neat . defining new variables",
    "@xmath608 , we have , by , @xmath609 and @xmath610 .",
    "so we have @xmath611 hence we get @xmath612    now using equations [ eqn : cor ] , [ eqn : cor2 ] and the definition of the variables @xmath613 , we get @xmath614 since this is true for all @xmath615 , and since the matrix @xmath616 has maximal rank ( because , since the curves @xmath617 are distinct , the lines of that matrix are linearly independent ) and since the norm of the vector @xmath618 is one , then we can conclude the following : @xmath619 that is @xmath620 for some @xmath621 , as we wanted to prove .",
