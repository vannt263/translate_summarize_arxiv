    "mixing processes in fluids play a key role in a wide variety of engineering applications and for natural systems such as the ocean and atmosphere .",
    "their theoretical study has been a major focus of research , as indicated by the large number of review articles  @xcite . at the smallest scales mixing",
    "is achieved by molecular diffusion processes , but it may be facilitated greatly by stirring .",
    "the result of stirring is usually to enhance the effect of molecular diffusion and increase the mixing rate  @xcite .",
    "quantitative understanding of the fundamental features of stirring and its influence on mixing processes is important for the effective modeling , simulation and design or control of these systems .",
    "the `` efficiency '' of mixing means different things in different contexts .",
    "for example the dispersion of an initial distribution by an imposed flow is a transient problem where the temporal approach to the final fully mixed state , rather than the final state itself , is of central interest .",
    "consider for definiteness the homogeneous advection  diffusion equation for a passive scalar field @xmath0 stirred by a divergence - free velocity field @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the molecular diffusivity .",
    "if this equation is supplied with initial concentration @xmath4 and applied in an appropriate domain without sources , sinks or scalar flux at the boundaries , then the integral of @xmath5 is conserved , so without loss of generality it may be taken to vanish from the start .",
    "but the @xmath6-norm @xmath7 , proportional to the scalar variance in finite volume domains , decreases with time . indeed , multiplying ( [ eq : adhomo ] ) by @xmath5 and integrating by parts , @xmath8 indicating an inexorable decay of the variance .",
    "efficient mixing in this transient decay problem means faster decay of the scalar variance .",
    "the mixing efficiency of a particular flow could be defined , for example , in terms of its ability to reduce the variance from the initial value to a prescribed value within a specific period of time  @xcite . because the right - hand side of ( [ eq : adhomodecay ] ) is proportional to @xmath3 , it is evident that molecular processes are ultimately responsible for mixing by this criterion . even though the stirring field does not appear explicitly in ( [ eq : adhomodecay ] )",
    ", the conventional intuition is that material line stretching in the flow can amplify scalar gradients thereby enhancing the molecular mixing rate .",
    "indeed , the velocity s rate - of - strain matrix serves as the local growth rate of the scalar gradient field .",
    "these issues are of extreme interest for both theory and applications , but in this paper we are interested in a distinct scenario where different effects are at work .    mixing a scalar field whose fluctuations",
    "are constantly replenished by steady but spatially inhomogeneous sources and sinks is a problem with a long history .",
    "early on , townsend  @xcite was concerned with the effect of turbulence and molecular diffusion on a line - source of temperature , a heated filament .",
    "the spatial localization of the source , imposed by experimental constraints , enhanced the role of molecular diffusivity .",
    "saffman  @xcite also found that molecular diffusion and turbulent diffusion were not simply additive and that higher - order corrections were needed .",
    "durbin  @xcite and drummond  @xcite introduced stochastic particle models to turbulence modeling , and these allowed more detailed studies of the effect of the source on diffusion .",
    "sawford and hunt  @xcite pointed out that small sources , such as heated filaments , lead to an explicit dependence of the variance on molecular diffusivity .",
    "many refinements to these models followed , see for instance  @xcite and the review by sawford  @xcite .",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite and balkovsky & fouxon  @xcite treated the case of a random , statistically - steady source .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to make the source - dependence of the concentration variance more precise by working directly from the advection ",
    "diffusion equation , without specifying the underlying turbulent statistics other than basic stationarity and homogeneity assumptions .",
    "when a source of scalar concentration is present , the transient kinetics are of less immediate interest and instead the properties of the ( statistical ) steady state are of greater relevance . as will be seen , this sustained steady - state dynamics highlights other features of stirring and mixing processes .",
    "in comparing the steady - state problem to the transient problem defined by eq .  , it is important to remember that the long - time asymptotic behavior of the decaying problem is usually irrelevant to the corresponding long - time behavior of the steady - state problem .",
    "this is because the continuous replenishing of concentration overwhelms small - amplitude effects observed for long - time decay , such as the ` strange eigenmode '  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the stirring and mixing of a passive scalar sustained by a steady source - sink function  @xmath9 .",
    "given a prescribed divergence - free velocity field @xmath1 and a molecular diffusivity  @xmath3 , the scalar concentration @xmath0 obeys the inhomogeneous advection  diffusion equation @xmath10 supplemented with initial concentration field @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a domain without any net scalar flux at the boundaries : the periodic box of size @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 , the @xmath13-dimensional torus of volume @xmath14 .",
    "the spatial mean of @xmath5 is computed immediately , @xmath15 and deviations from the spatial mean satisfy ( [ eq : ad ] ) with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath16 .",
    "so to study the fluctuations we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath4 and @xmath9 , and thus also @xmath0 have spatial mean zero .",
    "fluctuations in the scalar concentration are natually measured in terms of the steady - state variance @xmath17 , where we introduce the space - time average .",
    "the two averaging operations we use are the time average @xmath18 assuming as necessary that the limit exists , and the space - time average @xmath19 effective stirring makes the scalar field more spatially uniform , lowering the variance , and this is the basic mixing effect that we set out to study .",
    "many investigations have been concerned with other statistical properties of the scalar field for this kind of model , such as details of the tails of the probability distribution of @xmath5  @xcite . while these studies present fascinating mathematical and physical issues , in terms of applications they are most likely to be of ultimate use in designing closure approximations , i.e. , models of the model , in order to accurately estimate bulk measures of mixing like variance reduction . in this work",
    "we focus directly on the supression of the scalar fluctuations as a primary indicator of mixing .    in terms of the fourier decomposition of the scalar field , @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath22 , the steady - state variance is @xmath23",
    "the magnitude @xmath24 of the wavenumbers naturally index spatial scales , so information about the fluctuations at different scales may be obtained by weighting the sums of the fourier coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the simplest indicators of the fluctuations on small and large scales are , respectively , @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the inverse gradient @xmath27 is defined in fourier space as multiplication by @xmath28 , a well - defined operator on these functions with spatial mean zero .",
    "for the purposes of this study the effectiveness of stirring on mixing at relatively small and large scales will be gauged in terms of these norms .",
    "efficient stirring decreases the variances on all scales , although it can be expected that any particular stirring may be more effective on some scales than on others .",
    "it is appropriate here to point out a fundamental and elementary distinction between transient and steady - state stirring .",
    "for efficient transient mixing the goal is to decrease the scalar variance @xmath29 as quickly as possible by _ increasing _ the gradient variance @xmath30 via stirring .",
    "however in the steady - state problem stirring can only _ reduce _ the mean scalar gradient variance  and thus the mean rate of variance decay  from its purely diffusive value in the absence of stirring .",
    "the proof of this ( perhaps unexpected ) fact is easy .",
    "multiplying ( [ eq : ad ] ) by @xmath5 and averaging over space and time with appropriate integrations by parts produces the well - known balance @xmath31 inserting the gradient and its inverse on the right - hand side , integrating by parts again , and then employing the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality yields @xmath32    note that the long - time solution of ( [ eq : ad ] ) in the absence of stirring is the steady - state solution @xmath33 of the diffusion equation with source @xmath9 , @xmath34 where the inverse laplacian is multiplication by @xmath35 in fourier space . solving for the steady - state scalar gradient variance in ( [ glinda ] ) and noting that @xmath36 , we conclude that @xmath37    this relationship is uniform in the advecting velocity field @xmath1 implying that no clever stirring on any scales can increase the mean scalar gradient variance over its baseline unstirred value . in light of this observation we may anticipate that stirring strategies designed to maximize mixing efficiency in the sustained source problem are likely to be different from those employed in the transient decay scenario .",
    "the variances @xmath38 , defined above for @xmath39 , are both dimensional and dimensionally distinct quantities . in order to compare them with each other or to compare different physical systems we need sensible nondimensional measures .",
    "hence we define the dimensionless _ multi - scale mixing efficiencies _",
    ", denoted @xmath40 for @xmath39 , via @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the steady solution of the unstirred problem defined in ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "effective stirring decreases scalar variances relative to those due to diffusion alone , increasing these mixing efficiences .",
    "the calculation resulting in ( [ boc ] ) has established that @xmath43 .",
    "intensifying the stirring often increases the mixing efficiencies and it is important to characterize this property in terms of the forcefulness of the flow .",
    "the simplest bulk measure of the vigor of the velocity field is its mean kinetic energy , or equivalently the _ rms _ speed @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 the nondimensional measure of the strength of the stirring relative to the effect of molecular viscosity is the pclet number @xmath46 that we define as @xmath47 using the domain length scale @xmath11 for simplicity here .",
    "it will become apparent that this domain length scale may not be the most appropriate one for this purpose ; determining the relevant length scales is one of the central points of this study .    for many applications",
    "it is useful to know how fluctuations at various length scales may be suppressed as functions of @xmath3 , @xmath44 , and other features of the problem such as details of the flow and source - sink structures . toward this end",
    "it is desirable to know how the multi - scale mixing efficiencies depend on the pclet number , and the notion of `` eddy diffusivity '' provides a conceptual benchmark for this dependence .    a flow with velocity scale @xmath44 and `` persistence length '' , `` mixing length '' or  eddy size \" @xmath48 that characterizes the typical distance a particle travels before changing direction can disperse particles diffusively on appropriate space and/or time scales .",
    "this suggests that when advection dominates molecular diffusion , an effective diffusion with coefficient @xmath49 might replace the advection to determine some gross statistical features of the scalar field .",
    "is much smaller than any length scales in the initial data @xmath4 or the source @xmath9 is the setting for homogenization theory . ]",
    "if this is so , then the steady - state scalar variances are all @xmath50 and the efficiencies are all @xmath51 . according to this argument @xmath52    the linear scaling @xmath53 at high pclet numbers , which we will refer to as the `` classical '' scaling , provides a baseline reference for the multi - scale mixing efficiencies .",
    "flows that generate this classical scaling asymptotically as @xmath54 produce a truly effective  residual \" molecular - like diffusion as far as the suppresion of variances at the various spatial scales is concerned , even in the singular @xmath55 limit of vanishing molecular diffusivity . and as this discussion suggests , if the efficiency scales classically then the prefactor provides a precise prediction of the length scale with which an eddy diffusivity might be meaningfully identified .",
    "the principal purpose of this paper is to determine limits on the mixing efficiencies , i.e. , to derive _ a priori _ bounds on @xmath40 as a function of @xmath46 , and to investigate what sort of flows might realize those limits .",
    "upper bounds on @xmath56 are of particular interest because they characterize the most efficient stirring strategies that can possibly be hoped for",
    ". if the bounds are to be useful then they should be realizable or approachable , or at the very least indicative of the kind of behavior that is possible  such as a scaling like @xmath57 at high pclet numbers .",
    "upper bounds on the mixing efficiencies follow from lower bounds on the variances and the first study in this direction was apparently by thiffeault , doering , and gibbon @xcite who focused on estimates and simulations for @xmath58 .",
    "they adapted an approach that had been used to bound turbulent dissipation in the navier ",
    "stokes equations @xcite for application to inhomogeneous advection  diffusion equations . for the steady source model of interest",
    "here they showed that if @xmath59 then @xmath60 where the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 are homogeneous scale invariant functionals of the source @xmath63 , i.e. , invariant under the transformation @xmath64 for any constants @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "that result showed that very generally the classical scaling is an upper limit to the mixing efficiency in this most basic sense .",
    "moreover , the coefficient in the high pclet number scaling @xmath67 puts a limit on any reasonable value for a mixing length : @xmath68 .",
    "it is especially notable that this rigorous estimate of @xmath48 ( really of the prefactor @xmath62 ) is uniform in the stirring field @xmath69 and independent of any length scales it exhibits .",
    "it also is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "it emerges as a length scale in the source - sink distribution , which is seen to play a more important role in the mixing process than the conventional eddy diffusion picture anticipates .",
    "when the relevant length scale in the sustaining source and sink is small then the variance suppression by advection is necessarily limited by this no matter what spectrum of scales is present in the stirring process .",
    "these observations serve as the starting point for this study . here",
    "we carry forward the investigation of stirring and variance suppression by extending the analysis to multi - scale mixing measures while focusing on a broad but specific class of statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic flows .",
    "the restriction to this class of flows  a class that includes but is not limited to homogeneous isotropic high reynolds number turbulence  allows for the exact solution of some variational problems for bounds on the mixing efficiencies . for certain sources and sinks these bounds yield anomalous sub - classical exponents for the @xmath46 scaling of some of the @xmath40 .",
    "thus anomalous scaling is inevitable for some source - sink distributions . in those cases it",
    "can not be avoided by manipulating details of the flow or the spectrum of the stirring .",
    "we study the case of a monochromatic source @xmath70 in detail .",
    "the estimates are particularly simple in this case and they are sharp : we will exhibit a statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic stirring strategy that saturates the upper bounds .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the relevant class of statistically stationary , homogeneous and isotropic flows in section  [ sec : shif ] , and present some specific examples .",
    "we formulate variational problems for bounds on the mixing efficiencies in section  [ sec : bounds ] , and derive general estimates . in section  [ sec : saturation ]",
    "we evaluate the bounds explicitly for some particular sources and sinks and show that classical scaling estimates may be sharp . in section  [ sec : sarsas ] we focus on the high-@xmath46 behavior of the mixing efficiency bounds for a variety of source - sink distributions , and show that anomalous sub - classical scaling is sometimes unavoidable .    in section  [ sec : sssssf ]",
    "we are concerned with the fundamental example of a monochromatic source stirred by a flow with a single length scale , the so - called random sine flow , a type of renewing flow .",
    "measuring the mixing efficiencies in direct numerical simulations , we find that the large - scale efficiency @xmath71 scales ( nearly ) classically with respect to @xmath46 , like its upper bound , but the intermediate and small - scale efficiencies @xmath72 and @xmath73 scale sub - classically , i.e. , with powers of @xmath46 less than 1 . we show that the anomalous exponents for @xmath58 and @xmath73 can be deduced from the asymptotic analysis of a static flow problem .",
    "the concluding section  [ sec : sandd ] contains a summary of the results along with a discussion of open problems and compelling future challenges .",
    "some technical details are relegated to appendices .",
    "our approach to estimating mixing efficiencies is kinematic : the stirring vector field @xmath74 is assumed to be given .",
    "it could be a solution of the navier ",
    "stokes equations , or it could be a stochastic process with convenient or interesting spectral properties , or it could be a regular time - periodic field .",
    "the mixing efficiency bounds obtained in this paper will apply so long as a few generic statistical conditions are satisfied .",
    "of course not every stirring field satisfying these conditions will saturate the bounds , but they are all limited by them .    this analysis in this paper",
    "is concerned with velocity fields that satisfy the following three conditions :    * the field is divergence free , @xmath75 , everywhere and at all times . *",
    "the field has finite mean kinetic energy , @xmath76 , so that the pclet number @xmath77 is finite .",
    "we will also presume more regularity for the velocity whenever necessary to carry out formal calculations",
    ". this will be apparent in the course of the applications if the ultimate estimates depend on other norms of the field . *",
    "the velocity field is statistically stationary , homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "for the purposes of this work these qualities are defined by the one- and two - point equal time statistics ( presuming that these time averages exist pointwise in space ) @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 depends only on the magnitude @xmath24 of the wavenumber @xmath81 .",
    "the conditions of finite energy and incompressiblity are familiar and straightforward . in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss these stationarity , homogeneity and isotropy conditions and their relevant implications for the calculation of bounds on the various multi - scale mixing efficiencies .",
    "we also provide explicit examples , i.e. , we describe several flows with these properties that will be useful for considerations in subsequent sections .    first , setting @xmath82 in ( [ eq : shit ] ) produces the single point component - by - component covariance @xmath83 note that because @xmath80 depends only on the magnitude of the wavenumber , @xmath84 thus @xmath85 where we identify the mean square velocity @xmath86",
    ".    then if the velocity field is sufficiently regular ( or equivalently if @xmath80 decays sufficiently fast as @xmath87 ) we may also deduce some correlations of the derivatives of @xmath88 .",
    "for example differentiating @xmath89 in ( [ eq : shit ] ) by @xmath90 and setting @xmath91 leads to @xmath92 because @xmath80 summed against an odd number of orthogonal components vanishes when the sum is absolutely convergent .",
    "differentiating @xmath89 by @xmath90 and @xmath93 , setting @xmath91 , and subsequently contracting over @xmath24 and @xmath94 gives @xmath95 where we identify the enstrophy @xmath96 . in the context of statistical turbulence theory the ratio @xmath97 is ( proportional to ) the taylor microscale .",
    "an example of such a statistically stationary homogeneous isotropic flow is the solution @xmath74 of the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath100 is a spatially periodic body force applied to maintain a statistical steady state .",
    "of course the forcing would have to be capable of producing the homogeneous and isotropic statistics described above , not an altogether trivial task .",
    "this approach would be taken to study mixing properties of high - reynolds number turbulent flows .",
    "other flows may be easier and more convenient to implement in simulations or to utilize in the analysis of specific models .",
    "some features of the stirring  for instance a stationary energy spectrum consistent with developed turbulence  can be realized by specifying the modal amplitudes @xmath101 as mean - zero stochastic processes with @xmath102 and appropriately uncorrelated for distinct wavenumbers , to produce any desired energy spectrum @xmath103 .",
    "this is possible when @xmath104 depends only on the magnitude @xmath24 of the wavenumber @xmath81 .",
    "one model of interest is a flow involving just a single wavenumber @xmath105 , the random sine flow , a.k.a .",
    "the renewing wave flow  @xcite .",
    "( the term ` renewing ' or ` renovating ' has been used to refer to flows that are piecewise - constant in time but change randomly at regular intervals  @xcite .",
    "zeldovich  @xcite introduced a similar single - mode flow , but it was oscillatory rather than renewing and thus had poor mixing properties . ) in this example the velocity vector field switches periodically among steady shearing flows of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 and the phase @xmath109 is selected independently and uniformly from @xmath110 upon each switch .",
    "the switching may be strictly periodic or random in time , and in either case the characteristic persistence @xmath111 is another parameter of this flow .",
    "of course an appropriate selection of the directions for @xmath81 and @xmath112 must be made in order to realize statistical homogeneity and isotropy by the definition used here .",
    "the kinetically simplest possible example of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic flow is one where only @xmath113 . at each instant of time",
    "the flow is then spatially uniform , a steady wind @xmath114 with the direction switching periodically or randomly in time so that the time average of @xmath69 vanishes and the component - component correlation satisfies @xmath115 .",
    "this wind could sample many directions , or as few as @xmath116 in the @xmath117 directions along an orthogonal set of coordinate axes .",
    "in this section we derive bounds on the multi - scale mixing efficiencies @xmath118 for  @xmath119 , corresponding to intermediate , small , and large scales , respectively , for flows that satisfy the statistical homogeneity and isotropy conditions in and .",
    "we first briefly address lower bounds , but focus for the most part on upper estimates .",
    "the variational formulation and solution for upper bounds on intermediate and large length scales proceeds along similar lines , so we shall treat the variance in detail and give a more brisk derivations for the large - scale mixing measure .",
    "two different lower estimates on the small - scale variance , corresponding to upper bounds on the mixing efficiency at small scales , are derived .",
    "one of these small - scale results depends on the spectral distribution of energy in the stirring field while the other depends only on the total bulk energy .",
    "lower bounds on the mixing efficiencies follow from upper bounds on the corresponding variances .",
    "we already derived a lower bound for the small - scale mixing efficiency @xmath73 in the introduction by considering the steady - state variance dissipation - production balance in ( [ elphaba ] ) , @xmath120 the subsequent result in ( [ boc ] ) , valid for any incompressible flow even without invoking any statistical assumptions , is precisely the statement that @xmath43 .",
    "we expect that this estimate can be sharp in the sense that there may exist a flow field with arbitrary pclet number that may realize it .",
    "certainly this is true in @xmath121 : given the source - sink function @xmath9 with unstirred scalar distribution @xmath33 , just define a flow field with stream function @xmath122 .",
    "the streamlines of such a flow are along level sets of @xmath42 so the flow has no effect . indeed , for this flow @xmath123 no matter what the magnitude of @xmath44 is , so @xmath42 is the stationary solution of the advection ",
    "diffusion equation for any value of @xmath46 . however , this perfectly `` non - mixing '' flow is not statistically stationary , homogeneous and isotropic , and it is not clear whether further constraints derived from the full advection  diffusion equation might be implemented to raise this lower estimate for such fluctuating flows .",
    "we leave that question for a future study .",
    "we can follow the same line of reasoning to derive lower estimates on the other mixing efficiencies , although perhaps with less satisfaction .",
    "a lower bound on @xmath58 requires an upper estimate on @xmath124 . starting from ( [ elphaba2 ] ) , recalling that @xmath5 has spatial mean zero and invoking poincar s inequality on the left and cauchy ",
    "schwarz on the right , @xmath125 hence we deduce the upper estimate on the scalar variance , @xmath126 the unstirred variance is @xmath127 so we have the lower estimate @xmath128 this lower estimate is strictly positive but because @xmath129 it is @xmath130 .",
    "hence it does not rule out the existence of flows that might _ increase _ scalar variance .",
    "note as well that this estimate depends explicitly on the functional `` shape '' of the source - sink distribution , a feature that we will find for many estimates  upper and lower  on the mixing efficiencies .",
    "the result can in principle be sharpened by solving the variational problem @xmath131 where the maximization is performed over all @xmath132 satisfying the ( periodic ) boundary conditions on the domain .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the maximizer @xmath133 is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint ( [ elphaba2 ] ) . in terms of the fourier",
    "coefficients the solution of ( [ elphaba8 ] ) is straightforward , @xmath136 but @xmath135 is the solution of @xmath137 in general it is difficult to solve ( [ elphaba10 ] ) for @xmath135 , but there is one case where it is easy : if the source is `` monochromatic '' , i.e. , involves only a single wavenumber of amplitude @xmath138 , then @xmath139 so @xmath140 hence stirring a monochromatic source can never increase the variance . however if the source - sink distribution involves even just two distinct wavenumbers , then the solution of ( [ elphaba10])which must be performed numerically  yields a value for @xmath135 that produces a lower bound for @xmath58 that is strictly less than 1  @xcite .",
    "further details are relegated to appendix a ; this analysis does not prove that there actually is some stirring that can increase the scalar variance for such sources , but it leaves open the possibility .",
    "for the purposes of this study we will settle for this lower bound as far as its pclet number scaling is concerned .",
    "that is , @xmath141 where the positive coefficient @xmath65 may depend on the source - sink distribution , and we can not rule out that it might be less than 1 .    a lower bound on the large - scale mixing efficiency follows from the constraint ( [ elphaba2 ] ) via poincar s and the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequalities as well .",
    "it follows from ( [ elphaba4 ] ) that @xmath142 so that @xmath143 we note again that for the special case of a monochromatic source , a variational formulation as in ( [ elphaba7 ] ) yields the improved lower bound @xmath144 .",
    "it remains an open problem to determine if these lower estimates @xmath145 are sharp for arbitrary sources and sinks stirred by some statistically homogeneous and isotropic flow .",
    "( we will show that they are sharp in some particular cases . )",
    "certainly it will be necessary to use more than just ( [ elphaba2 ] ) to answer this question in general .",
    "this analysis begins by multiplying the advection ",

    "an important point here is that we can average the time - dependent self - adjoint operator @xmath157 before carrying out the maximization over  @xmath109 .",
    "maximizing   over @xmath109 is equivalent to minimizing its denominator . without loss of generality ,",
    "since the functional   is homogeneous in  @xmath109 , we constrain @xmath109 to have unit projection onto the source .",
    "thus we must minimize the functional @xmath158 leading to the euler  lagrange equation @xmath159 where @xmath135 is a lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint @xmath160 .",

    "physical boundaries or a different golbal topology ( e.g. a spherical domain as relevant to geophysical applications ) will likewise invalidate the uniform - wind solution .",
