    "in 1930 , dirac @xcite suggested the idea of identifying the vacuum with a sea of virtual electrons with negative kinetic energy .",
    "his theory implies that when a sufficiently strong source of energy is provided to the vacuum , some virtual electrons are excited into real electrons , leaving `` holes '' in the dirac sea .",
    "these holes can be interpreted as positrons , the anti - particles of the electrons , which were experimentally observed in 1933 by anderson @xcite .",
    "the extraction of an electron from the dirac sea is usually called _ electron - positron pair creation_. sauter @xcite , and heisenberg - euler @xcite considered the possibility that an external electromagnetic field could excite the dirac sea to create those pairs .",
    "schwinger @xcite then computed the probability of dynamical pair creation by a constant , uniform , external electric field in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the specific phenomenon of pair production triggered by an external , non - quantized field is thus labeled the _ schwinger effect_. it is remarkable that this effect is different from the absorption of photons by the vacuum , which is another possible source for pair creation . the schwinger effect is based on the fact that the vacuum acts as a polarizable medium which can decay into electron - positron pairs when excited by a sufficiently strong electric field . although the modern formulation of qed no longer describes the vacuum as a sea of virtual particles , dirac s theory is still valid in the mean - field approximation @xcite .    experimentally , pair creation in electric fields has not been observed yet because it is only non - negligible in a very strong field .",
    "however , recent progress in laser physics have permitted to create very strong fields , making the observation of the schwinger effect possible in the near future @xcite .",
    "one has to distinguish between _ dynamical _ and _ static _ pair creation .",
    "dynamical pair creation consists in studying the time evolution of the vacuum state when an external field is progressively turned on , so that a pair consisting of a scattering electron and a corresponding hole in the dirac sea is created .",
    "the external field is then progressively switched off , and one has to check if the pair still exists when the field is completely turned off .",
    "static pair creation , on the other hand , consists in the study of the absolute ground state ( the polarized vacuum ) of the hamiltonian in an external field .",
    "therefore , it is a time - independent process . in this context , the vacuum with an additional particle is energetically more favorable than the vacuum without particle .",
    "static pair creation is easier to study than dynamical pair creation , but it is also a bit less relevant from the physical point of view .",
    "when the interactions between particles are neglected ( the so - called _ linear _ case ) , _ static _ pair creation was mathematically studied by klaus and scharf @xcite .",
    "they proved that the probability of pair creation becomes 1 when the strength of the positive external field sufficiently increases such that an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian of the system crosses zero . in the linear case , _ dynamical _",
    "pair creation is a very involved phenomenon , whose properties were mathematically understood very recently .",
    "nenciu @xcite proved that there is a discontinuity in the probability to create pairs as the strength of a specific external field increases , in the adiabatic limit .",
    "later on , pickl and drr @xcite proved that the probability of pair creation tends to 1 in the adiabatic limit , for general over - critical external fields , by carefully studying the resonances created by the eigenvalues diving into the essential spectrum of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this article is devoted to the mathematical study of _ static _ pair creation in a _ nonlinear _ model describing the polarized vacuum , taking into account the interactions between particles .",
    "this model was first proposed by chaix and iracane @xcite in 1989 and it has recently been given a solid mathematical ground in a series of papers by gravejat , hainzl , lewin , sr , and solovej @xcite .",
    "as in those papers , the main difficulty of our work is the nonlinearity of the model .",
    "the more involved study of dynamical pair creation for the same model will be the subject of future work .    in the considered model , the polarized vacuum in a potential generated by a density of charge @xmath3",
    "is described by an operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 ( a density matrix ) .",
    "this operator is a solution to the nonlinear equation @xmath6}(d_z ) } } } + \\delta \\\\       d_z & = & d^0 + \\alpha\\left(\\rho_{p_z-\\frac{1}{2 } } -z\\nu\\right)\\star|\\cdot|^{-1 }          \\end{array}\\right . , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the ( free ) dirac operator and @xmath8 is any self - adjoint operator such that @xmath9 with @xmath10 . discarding the operator @xmath8",
    ", we see that @xmath4 is the ground state in the grand canonical ensemble of a dressed dirac operator with density of charge @xmath3 perturbed by the density @xmath11 of the vacuum .",
    "the polarized vacuum therefore interacts with itself .",
    "we shall consider the operator @xmath4 in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "of our particular interest is the probability that pairs are generated , which is a nonlinear function of @xmath4 ( see section [ sec : def - proba ] below ) .",
    "the usual picture @xcite is that if the first eigenvalue @xmath12 of @xmath13 is negative , as showed in figure [ fig : spectre ] , then the vacuum becomes charged and the probability of creating at least one pair is 1 . in the linear case , hainzl @xcite showed that the charge of the vacuum in the external density @xmath3 is exactly the number of eigenvalues ( counted with multiplicity ) of the operator @xmath14 crossing 0 when we increase @xmath15 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "however , because of the nonlinearity of the model we study , detecting for which values of @xmath0 the first eigenvalue will cross 0 is very difficult .",
    "however , the probability of pair creation can be very close to 1 without any crossing , as we will explain in section [ sec : def - proba ] .",
    "more precisely , we prove that the probability of static pair creation behaves as @xmath1 ( see theorem [ th : main ] ) , where @xmath0 is the charge of a nucleus put in the vacuum , and @xmath18 is a constant depending on different parameters of the model such as the cut - off or the shape of the nucleus .",
    "the proof relies on the large-@xmath0 asymptotics of the polarized vacuum energy , which is obtained by using an appropriate trial state .",
    "this implies that the average number of particles of the polarized vacuum is of order @xmath19 .",
    "we then use general estimates showing that the probability to create pairs for a quasi - free quantum state is bigger than @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the average number of particles of the quantum state and @xmath22 is a universal constant .",
    "since for the polarized vacuum @xmath23 , the result follows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we introduce the bogoliubov - dirac - fock model and we state our main result . in section 2 , we prove the general estimates on quasi - free states on fock space , which are of independent interest . in the end of section 2",
    "we come back to our particular setting . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the large-@xmath0 asymptotics of the polarized vacuum energy . finally , in section 4",
    "we prove theorem [ th : main ] using the tools developed in section 2 and 3 . in appendix",
