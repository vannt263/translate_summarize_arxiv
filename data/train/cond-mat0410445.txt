    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates @xcite and the rapid raising of the transition temperature to well above the melting point of nitrogen @xcite ushered in an era of great excitement for the condensed matter physics community . for decades",
    "prior to this discovery , the highest @xmath5 had been stuck at 23  k. not only was the old record @xmath5 shattered , but the fact that high @xmath5 superconductivity was discovered in a rather unexpected material , a transition metal oxide , made it clear that some novel mechanism must be at work .",
    "the intervening years have seen great strides in high @xmath5 research .",
    "first and foremost , the growth and characterization of cuprate single crystals and thin films have advanced to the point where sample quality and reproducibility problems which plagued the field in the early days are no longer issues . at the same time , basically all conceivable experimental tools have been applied to the cuprates .",
    "indeed , the need for more and more refined data has spurred the development of experimental techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "today the cuprate is arguably the best studied material outside of the semiconductor family and a great deal of facts are known .",
    "it is also clear that many of the physical properties are unusual , particularly in the metallic state above the superconductor .",
    "superconductivity is only one aspect of a rich phase diagram which must be understood in its totality .",
    "superconductors showing hole doping ( right side ) and electron doping ( left side ) . from . ,",
    "width=326 ]    while there are hundreds of high @xmath5 compounds , they all share a layered structure made up of one or more copper - oxygen planes .",
    "they all fit into a `` universal '' phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "we start with the so - called `` parent compound , '' in this case la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 .",
    "there is now general agreement that the parent compound is an insulator , and should be classified as a mott insulator .",
    "the concept of mott insulation was introduced many years ago @xcite to describe a situation where a material should be metallic according to band theory , but is insulating due to strong electron - electron repulsion . in our case , in the copper - oxygen layer there is an odd number of electrons per unit cell .",
    "more specifically , the copper ion is doubly ionized and is in a @xmath8 configuration , so that there is a single hole in the @xmath4 shell per unit cell . according to band theory ,",
    "the band is half - filled and must be metallic .",
    "nevertheless , there is a strong repulsive energy cost to put two electrons ( or holes ) on the same ion , and when this energy ( commonly called @xmath9 ) dominates over the hopping energy @xmath0 , the ground state is an insulator due to strong correlation effects .",
    "it also follows that the mott insulator should be an antiferromagnet ( af ) , because when neighboring spins are oppositely aligned , one can gain an energy @xmath10 by virtual hopping .",
    "this is called the exchange energy @xmath1 .",
    "the parent compound is indeed an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the ordering temperature @xmath11k shown in fig .  [ fig.1 ] is in fact misleadingly low because it is governed by a small interlayer coupling , which is furthermore frustrated in la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( see ) .",
    "the exchange energy @xmath1 is in fact extraordinarily high , of order 1500  k , and the parent compound shows strong antiferromagnetic correlation much above @xmath12 .",
    "the parent compound can be doped by substituting some of the trivalent la by divalent sr .",
    "the result is that @xmath13 holes are added to the cu - o plane in la@xmath14sr@xmath15cuo@xmath7 .",
    "this is called hole doping . in the compound nd@xmath14ce@xmath15cuo@xmath7",
    ", the reverse happens in that @xmath13 electrons are added to the cu - o plane .",
    "this is called electron doping . as we can see from fig . 1",
    ", on the hole doping side the af order is rapidly suppressed and is gone by 3 to 5% hole concentration .",
    "almost immediately after the suppression of af , superconductivity appears , ranging from @xmath16% to 25% .",
    "the dome - shaped @xmath5 is characteristic of all hole - doped cuprates , even though the maximum @xmath5 varies from about 40  k in the la@xmath14sr@xmath15cuo@xmath7 ( lsco ) family to 93  k and higher in other families such as yba@xmath6cu@xmath17o@xmath18 ( ybco ) and ba@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath19 ( bi-2212 ) . on the electron doped side ,",
    "af is more robust and survives up to @xmath20 , beyond which a region of superconductivity arises .",
    "one view is that the carriers are more prone to be localized on the electron doped side , so that electron doping to closer to dilution by nonmagnetic ions , which is less effective in suppressing af order than itinerant carriers .",
    "another possibility is that the next neighbor hopping term favors af on the electron doped side @xcite .",
    "it is as though a more robust af region is covering up the more interesting phase diagram revealed on the hole doped side . in this review",
    "we shall focus on the hole doped materials , even though we will address the issue of the particle - hole asymmetry of the phase diagram from time to time .",
    "the region in the phase diagram with doping @xmath13 less than that of the maximum @xmath5 is called the underdoped region .",
    "the metallic state above @xmath5 has been under intense study and exhibits many unusual properties not encountered before in any other metal .",
    "this region of the phase diagram has been called the pseudogap phase .",
    "it is not a well defined phase in that a definite finite temperature phase boundary has never been found .",
    "the line drawn in fig .  1 should be regarded as a cross - over .",
    "since we view the high @xmath5 problem as synonymous with that of doping a mott insulator , the underdoped region is where the battleground between mott insulator and superconductivity is drawn and this is where we shall concentrate on in this review .",
    "the region of the normal state above the optimal @xmath5 also exhibits unusual properties .",
    "the resistivity is linear in @xmath21 and the hall coefficient is temperature dependent ( see ) .",
    "these were cited as examples of non - fermi liquid behavior since the early days of high @xmath5 . beyond optimal doping (",
    "called the overdoped region ) , sanity gradually returns .",
    "the normal state behaves more normally in that the temperature dependence of the resistivity resembles @xmath22 over a temperature range which increases with further overdoping .",
    "the anomalous region above optimal doping is sometimes referred to as the `` strange metal '' region .",
    "we offer a qualitative description of this region in section ix , but in our mind the understanding of the `` strange metal '' is even more rudimentary that of the `` pseudogap . ''",
    "a popular notion is that the strange metal is characterized by a quantum critical point lying under the superconducting dome (; ; ) in our view , unless the nature of the ordered side of a quantum critical point is classified , the simple statement of quantum criticality does not teach us too much about the behavior in the critical region .",
    "for this reason , we prefer to concentrate on the underdoped region and leave the strange metal phase to future studies .",
    "contrary to the experimental situation , the development of high @xmath5 theory follows a rather tortuous path and people often have the impression that the field is highly contentious and without a clear direction or consensus .",
    "we do not agree with this assessment and would like to clearly state our point of view from the outset .",
    "our starting point is , as already stated , that the physics of high @xmath5 superconductivity is the physics of doping a mott insulator .",
    "strong correlation is the driving force behind the phase diagram .",
    "we believe that there is a general consensus on this starting point . the simplest model which captures the strong correlation physics is the hubbard model and its strong coupling limit , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "our view is that one should focus on understanding these simple models before adding various elaborations .",
    "for example , further neighbor hopping certainly is significant and as we shall discuss , plays an important role in understanding the particle - hole asymmetry of the phase diagram .",
    "electron - phonon coupling can generally be expected to be strong in transition metal oxides , and we shall discuss their role in affecting spectral line shape .",
    "however , these discussions must be made in the context of strong correlation .",
    "the logical step is to first understand whether simple models such as the @xmath0-@xmath1 model contains enough physics to explain the appearance of superconductivity and pseudogaps in the phase diagram .",
    "the strong correlation viewpoint was put forward by , who revived his earlier work on a possible spin liquid state in a frustrated antiferromagnet .",
    "this state , called the resonating valence band ( rvb ) , has no long range af order and is a unique spin singlet ground state .",
    "it has spin 1/2 fermionic excitations which are called spinons .",
    "the idea is that when doped with holes the rvb is a singlet state with coherent mobile carriers , and is indistinguishable in terms of symmetry from a singlet bcs superconductor .",
    "the process of hole doping was further developed by who argue that the combination of the doped hole with the spinon form a bosonic excitation .",
    "this excitation , called the holon , carries charge but no spin whereas the spinon carries spin 1/2 but no charge , and the notion of spin - charge separation was born .",
    "meanwhile , a slave - boson theory was formulated by .",
    "many authors contributed to the development of the mean field theory , culminating in the paper by who found that the superconducting state should have @xmath4-symmetry and that a state with spin gap properties should exist above the superconducting temperature in the underdoped region .",
    "the possibility of d - wave superconductivity has been discussed in terms of the exchange of spin fluctuations ( , @xcite ; ; , @xcite ; ) .",
    "these discussions are either based on phenomenological coupling between spins and fermions or via rpa treatment for the harbbard model which is basically a weak coupling expansion .",
    "in contrast , the salve - boson theory was developed in the limit of strong repulsion .",
    "details of the mean field theory will be discussed in section viii .    at about the same time , the proposal by of using projected mean field states as trial wavefunctions was implemented on the computer by , @xcite .",
    "the idea is to remove by hand on a computer all components of the mean field wavefunction with doubly occupied sites , and use this as a variational wavefunction for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    ", @xcite concluded that the projected @xmath4-wave superconductor is the variational ground state for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model over a range of doping .",
    "the projected wavefunction method remains one of the best numerical tools to tackle the @xmath0-@xmath1 or hubbard model and is reviewed in section vi .",
    "it was soon realized that inclusion of fluctuations about the mean field invariably leads to gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge field fluctuations can be treated at a gaussian level and these early developments together with some of the difficulties are reviewed in section ix .    in hindsight , the slave - boson mean field theory and the projected wavefunction studies contain many of the qualitative aspects of the hole doped phase diagram .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable that the main tools of treating the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , projected trial wavefunction , slave - boson mean field , and gauge theory , were in place a couple of years after the discovery of high @xmath5 . in some way the theory was ahead of its time , because the majority view in the early days was that the pairing symmetry was @xmath23-wave , and the pseudogap phenomenology remains to be discovered .",
    "( the first hint came from knight shift measurements in 1989 shown in fig .",
    "[ chi](a ) . )",
    "some of the early history and recent extensions are reviewed by .",
    "the gauge theory approach is a difficult one to pursue systematically because it is a strong coupling problem .",
    "one important development is the realization that the original @xmath2 gauge theory should be extended to @xmath3 in order to make a smooth connection to the underdoped limit @xcite this is discussed in sections xi and xii .",
    "more generally , it was gradually realized that the concepts of confinement / deconfinement which are central to qcd also play a key role here , except that the presence of matter field make this problem even more complex .",
    "since gauge theories are not so familiar to condensed matter physicists , these concepts are discussed in some detail in section x. one of the notable recent advances is that the notion of the spin liquid and its relation to deconfinement in gauge theory has been greatly clarified and several soluble models and candidates based on numerical exact diagonalization have been proposed .",
    "it remains true , however , that so far no two - dimensional spin liquid has been convincingly realized experimentally .",
    "our overall philosophy is that the rvb idea of a spin liquid and its relation to superconductivity contains the essence of the physics and gives a qualitative description of the underdoped phase diagram .",
    "the goal of our research is to put these ideas on a more quantitative footing . given the strong coupling nature of the problem , the only way progress can be made is for theory to work in consort with experiment .",
    "our aim is to make as many predictions as possible , beyond saying that the pseudogap is a rvb spin liquid , and challenge the experimentalists to perform tests .",
    "ideas along these lines are reviewed in section xii .",
    "high @xmath5 research is an enormous field and we can not hope to be complete in our references . here",

    "it is generally agreed that the physics of high @xmath5 superconductivity is that of the copper oxygen layer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] . in the parent compound such as la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ,",
    "the formal valence of cu is @xmath24 , which means that its electronic state is in the @xmath8 configuration .",

    "the lobes of this orbital point directly to the @xmath25 orbital of the neighboring oxygen , forming a strong covalent bond with a large hopping integral @xmath29 . as we shall see , the strength of this covalent bonding is responsible for the unusually high energy scale for the exchange interaction",
    ". thus the electronic state of the cuprates can be described by the so - called 3 band model , where in each unit cell we have the cu @xmath30 orbital and two oxygen @xmath25 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the cu orbital is singly occupied while the @xmath25 orbitals are doubly occupied , but these are admixed by @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , admixtures between the oxygen orbitals may be included .",
    "these tight - binding parameters may be obtained by fits to band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "however , the largest energy in the problem is the correlation energy for doubly occupying the copper orbital . to describe these correlation energies , it is more convenient to go to the hole picture .",
    "the cu @xmath8 configuration is represented by energy level @xmath31 occupied by a single hole with @xmath32 .",
    "the oxygen @xmath25 orbital is empty of holes and lies at energy @xmath33 which is higher than @xmath31 .",
    "the energy to doubly occupy @xmath31 ( leading to a @xmath34 configuration ) is @xmath35 , which is very large and can be considered infinity .",
    "the lowest energy excitation is the charge transfer excitation where the hole hops from @xmath4 to @xmath25 with amplitude @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is sufficiently large compared with @xmath29 , the hole will form a local moment on cu .",
    "this is referred to as a charge transfer insulator in the scheme of .",
    "essentially , @xmath37 plays the role of the hubbard @xmath9 in the one - band model of the mott insulator .",
    "experimentally an energy gap of 2.0  ev is observed and interpreted as the charge transfer excitation ( see ) .    just as in the one - band mott - hubbard insulator , where virtual hopping to doubly occupied states leads to an exchange interaction @xmath38 where @xmath39",
    ", in the charge - transfer insulator , the local moments on nearest neighbor cu prefer antiferromagnetic alignment because both spins can virtually hop to the @xmath33 orbital . ignoring the @xmath40 for doubly occupying the @xmath25 orbital with holes , the exchange integral is given by j = t^4_pd(e_p - e_d)^3 .",
    "[ eq.1 ] the relatively small size of the charge transfer gap means that we are not deep in the insulating phase and the exchange term is expected to be large .",
    "indeed experimentally the insulator is found to be in an antiferromagnetic ground state . by fitting raman scattering to two magnon excitations @xcite ,",

    "la , the electron count on the cu - o layer can be changed in a process called doping . for example , in la@xmath14sr@xmath15cuo@xmath7 , @xmath13 holes per cu is added to the layer . as seen in fig .  2 , due to the large @xmath35",
    ", the hole will reside on the oxygen @xmath25 orbital .",
    "the hole can hop via @xmath29 and due to translational symmetry , the holes are mobile and form a metal , unless localization due to disorder or some other phase transition intervenes",
    ". the full description of the hole hopping in the three - band model is complicated , and a number of theories consider this essential to the understanding of high t@xmath42 superconductivity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there is strong evidence that the low energy physics ( on a scale small compared with @xmath29 and @xmath37 ) can be understood in terms of an effective one - band model , and we shall follow this route in this review .",
    "the essential insight is that the doped hole resonates on the four oxygen sites surrounding a cu and the spin of the doped hole combines with the spin on the cu to form a spin singlet .",
    "this is known as the zhang - rice singlet @xcite .",
    "this state is split off by an energy of order @xmath43 because the singlet gains energy by virtual hopping .",
    "on the other hand , the zhang - rice singlet can hop from site to site . since the hopping is a two step process , the effective hopping integral",
    "@xmath0 is also of order @xmath43 . since @xmath0 is the same parametrically as the binding energy of the singlet , the justification of this point of view relies on a large numerical factor for the binding energy which is obtained by studying small clusters .    by focusing on the low lying singlet ,",
    "the hole doped three - band model simplifies to a one - band tight binding model on the square lattice , with an effective nearest neighbor hopping integral @xmath0 given earlier and with @xmath37 playing a role analogous to @xmath9 . in the large @xmath37 limit this maps onto the @xmath0-@xmath1 model h = & p & ( -_ , t_c^_c_ .",

    "this vacancy can hop with a @xmath47 and the mapping to the one - band model is more direct than the hole doped case .",
    "note that in the full three - band model the object which is hopping is the zhang - rice singlet for hole doping and the cu @xmath46 configuration for electron doping .",
    "these have rather different spatial structure and are physically quite distinct .",
    "for example , the strength of their coupling to lattice distortions may be quite different .",
    "when mapped to the one - band model , the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 has the same parametric dependence , but could have a different numerical constant .",
    "as we shall see , the value of @xmath0 derived from cluster calculations turn out to be surprisingly similar for electron and hole doping . for a bi - partate lattice , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with nearest neighbor",
    "@xmath0 has particle - hole symmetry because the sign of @xmath0 can be absorbed by changing the sign of the orbital on one sublattice .",
    "experimentally the phase diagram exhibits strong particle - hole asymmetry . on the electron doped side ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic insulator survives up to much higher doping concentration ( up to @xmath48 ) and the superconducting transition temperature is quite low ( about 30  k ) . many of the properties of the superconductor resemble that of the overdoped region of the hole doped side and the pseudogap phenomenon , which is so prominent in the underdoped region , is not observed with electron doping .",
    "it is as though the greater stability of the antiferromagnet has covered up any anomalous regime that might exist otherwise",
    ". precisely why is not clear at the moment .",
    "one possibility is that polaron effects may be stronger on the electron doped side , leading to carrier localization over a broader range of doping .",
    "there has been some success in modeling the contrast in the single hole spectrum by introducing further neighbor coupling into the one - band model which breaks the particle - hole symmetry @xcite . this will be discussed further below .",
    "we conclude that the electron correlation is strong enough to produce a mott insulator at half filling .",
    "furthermore , the one band @xmath0-@xmath1 model captures the essence of the low energy electronic excitations of the cuprates .",
    "particle - hole asymmetry may be accounted for by including further neighbor hopping @xmath49 .",
    "this point of view has been tested extensively by who used _ ab initio _ local density functional theory to generate input parameters for the three - band hubbard model and then solve the spectra exactly on finite clusters .",

    "it is clear that in a 3d cubic lattice , the nel state is a far superior starting point , and in two dimensions the singlet state may present a serious competition . historically , the notion of a linear superposition of spin singlet pairs spanning different ranges , called the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) , was introduced by and as a possible ground state for the @xmath32 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice .",
    "the triangular lattice is of special interest because an ising - like ordering of the spins is frustrated .",

    "the nel state has long range order of the staggered magnetization and an infinite degeneracy of ground states leading to goldstone modes which are magnons .",
    "in contrast , the rvb state is a unique singlet ground state with either short range or power law decay of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this state of affairs is sometimes referred to as a spin liquid . however , the term spin liquid is often used more generally to denote any kind of short range or power law decay , the absence of long range order , even when the unit cell is doubled , either spontaneously or explicitly .",
    "for example , the ladder system has two states per unit cell and in the limit of strong coupling across the rung , the ground state is naturally a spin singlet with short range antiferromagnetic order .",

    "thus we think it is better to reserve the term spin liquid to cases where there is an odd number of electrons per unit cell .    soon after the discovery of high t@xmath42 superconductors , revived the rvb idea and proposed that with the introduction of holes the nel state is destroyed and the spins form a superposition of singlets .",
    "the vacancy can hop in the background of what he envisioned as a liquid of singlets and a better compromise between the hole kinetic energy and the spin exchange energy may be achieved .",
    "many elaborations of this idea followed , but here we argue that the basic physical picture described above gives a simple account of the pseudogap phenomenon . the singlet formation explains the decrease of the uniform spin susceptibility and the reduction of the specific heat @xmath62 .",

    "the conductivity spectral weight in the @xmath80 plane is given by the hole concentration @xmath13 and is unaffected by the singlet formation . on the other hand , for @xmath108-axis conductivity , an electron is transported between planes .",

    "vortices overlap and the nernst signal smoothly crosses over to that describable by gaussian fluctuation of superconducting amplitude and phase @xcite .",
    "very recently , the identification of the nernst region with fluctuating superconductivity was confirmed by the observation of diamagnetic fluctuations which persist up to the same temperature as the onset of the nernst signal @xcite .",
    "it remains necessary to explain why the resistivity looks metallic - like in this temperature range and does not show the strong magnetic field dependence one ordinarily expects for flux flow resistivity in the presence of thermally excited vortices .",
    "the explanation may lie in the breakdown of the standard bardeen - stephen model of flux flow resistivity . here",
    "the vortices have anomalously low dissipation because in contrast to bcs superconductors , there are no states inside the core to dissipate . proposed that the vortices are fast and yield a large flux flow resistivity . in the two fluid model ,",
    "the conductivity is the sum of the flux flow conductivity ( the superfluid part ) and the quasiparticle conductivity ( the normal part ) .",
    "the small flux flow conductivity is quickly shorted out by the nodal quasiparticle contributions , and the system behaves like a metal , but with carriers only in the nodal region .",
    "this is also reminiscent of the fermi arc picture .",
    "unfortunately , a more detailed modeling requires an understanding of the state inside the large core radius @xmath177 introduced in section iii.c which is not available up to now .    instead of generating vortices thermally , one can also generate them by applying a magnetic field .",

    "they estimate that the field needed to suppress the nernst signal to be of order @xmath258 where @xmath259 .",
    "this is the core size consistent with what is reported by stm tunneling experiments . at the same time , the field needed for a resistive transition is much lower",
    ". recently showed that in ybco@xmath129 superconductivity is destroyed by annealing or by applying a modest magnetic field . beyond this point",

    "thus this field induced metal may be coexisting with pairing amplitude and may be a very interesting new metallic state .",
    "what is the nature of the gapped state inside the vortex core as revealed by stm tunneling and how is it related to the pseudogap region ?",
    "a popular notion is that the vortex core state is characterized by a competing order .",
    "a variety of competing order has been proposed in the literature .",
    "an early suggestion was that the core has antiferromagnetic order and an explicit model was constructed based on the @xmath260 model of @xcite .",
    "however , this particular version has been criticized for its failure to take into account the strong coulomb repulsion and the proximity to the mott insulator (; ) .",
    "recently , more phenomenological version based on landau theory have been proposed (; ) where the antiferromagnetism may be incommensurate . as the temperature is raised into the pseudogap regime ,",
    "vortices proliferate and their cores overlap and , according to this view , the pseudogap is characterized by fluctuating competing order .",
    "the dynamic stripe picture @xcite is an example of this point of view .",
    "another proposal for competing order is for orbital currents (; ) . in this case",
    "the competing order is proposed to persist in the pseudogap region but is `` hidden '' from detection because of difficulties of coupling to the order . finally , as discussed earlier",
    ", the recent observation of checkerboard patterns in the vortex core and in some underdoped cuprates has inspired various proposals of charge density ordering .",
    "most of the proposals for competing order are phenomenological in nature .",
    "for example , the proximity of @xmath4-wave superconductivity to antiferromagnetism is simply assumed as an experimental fact .",
    "however , from a microscopic point of view , the surprise is that @xmath4-wave superconductivity turns out to be the winner of this competition .",
    "our goal is a microscopic explanation of both the superconducting and the pseudogap states",
    ". we shall give a detailed proposal for the vortex core in section xii.c .",
    "here we mention that while our proposal also calls for slowly varying orbital currents in the core , this fluctuating order is simply one manifestation of a quantum state .",
    "for example , enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuation is another manifestation . as discussed in section vi.c , this picture is fundamentally different from competing states described by landau theory . in the pseudogap phase ,",
    "vortices proliferate and overlap and all orders become very sort range . apart from characterizing this state as a spin liquid ( or rvb ) , the only possibility of order is a subtle one , called topological / quantum order .",
    "these concepts are described in section x and a possible experimental consequence is described in section xii.e .",
    "since the pseudogap is fundamentally a cross - over phenomenon , there is a lot of confusion about the size of the pseudogap and the temperature scale where it is observed . upon surveying the experimental literature",
    ", it seems to us that we should distinguish between two kinds of pseudogaps .",
    "the first is clearly due to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the energy scale of the pseudogap is the same as the low temperature superconducting gap and it extends over a surprisingly large range of temperatures above @xmath5 .",
    "this is what we called the nernst region in the last section .",
    "this kind of pseudogap has been observed in stm tunneling , where it is found that a reduction of the density of states persists above @xmath5 even in overdoped samples @xcite .",
    "we believe the pull - back of the leading edge observed in arpes shown in fig .  [ edge](a ) should be understood along these lines .",
    "there is another kind of pseudogap which is associated with singlet formation .",
    "a clear signature of this phenomenon is the downturn in uniform spin susceptibility shown in figs .",
    "[ knight ] and [ chi ] .",
    "the temperature scale of the onset is high and increases up to 300 to 400  k with underdoping .",
    "the energy scale associated with this pseudogap is also very large , and can extend up to 100  mev or beyond .",
    "for example , the onset of the reduction of the @xmath108-axis conductivity ( which one may interpret as twice the gap ) has been reported to exceed 1000  @xmath89 .",
    "this is also the energy scale one associates with the limiting stm tunneling spectrum observed in highly underdoped bi-2212 ( fig .",
    "[ stm](f ) ) and in na doped ca@xmath6cuo@xmath6cl@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the gap in these spectra is very broad and ill defined . in the arpes literature",
    "it is described as the `` high - energy pseudogap '' ( see ) or the `` hump '' energy .",
    "these spectra evolve smoothly into that of the insulating parent .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated in na - doped ca@xmath6cuo@xmath6cl@xmath6 and the arpes spectrum near the antinodal point looks remarkably similar to that seen by stm @xcite .",
    "examples of this kind of a spectrum can be seen in the samples ud46 and ud30 shown in fig .",
    "[ arpes](a ) .",
    "in contrast to the low energy pseudogap , a coherent quasiparticle peak is never seen at these very high energies when the system enters the superconducting state . instead",
    ", weak peaks may appear at lower energies , but judging from the stm data , these may be associated with inhomogeneity . in this connection , we point out that the often quoted @xmath86 line shown in fig .",
    "[ edge ] is actually a combination of the two kinds of pseudogaps .",
    "the solid triangles marking the onset of the leading edge refer to the fluctuating superconductor gap , while the solid squares are lower bounds based on the observation of the `` hump . ''",
    "another example of this difference is that in lsco , the superconducting gap is believed to be much smaller and the pull back of the leading edge is not seen by arpes . on the other hand ,",
    "the singlet formation is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ knight](b ) and the broad hump - like spectra is also seen by arpes @xcite .",
    "we note that in contrast to superconducting fluctuations which extend across the entire doping range but are substantially reduced for overdoped samples , the onset of singlet formation seems to end rather abruptly near optimal doping .",
    "the knight shift is basically temperature independent just above @xmath5 in optimally doped and certainly in slightly overdoped samples (; ) .",
    "for this reason , we propose that the pseudogap line and the nernst line may cross in the vicinity of optimal doping , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ nernst ] . in this connection",
    "it is interesting to note that the pseudogap has also been seen inside the vortex core @xcite . by definition ,",

    "therefore the polaron effect is a promising scenario to explain the spectral shape",

    "one is that the gauge fluctuations are strong and one can not have a well controlled small expansion parameter , except rather formal ones such as the large @xmath212 expansion .",
    "this issue is closely related to the confinement problem in lattice gauge theory , and will be discussed below and also in section x.h and xi.f .    the coupling constant of the gauge field is defined as the inverse of the coefficient of @xmath537 in the lagrangian .",
    "it is well - known that the strong coupling gauge field leads to confinement . in the confining phase ,",
    "only the gauge singlet particles appear in the physical spectrum , which corresponds for example to the physical electron and magnon in the present context .",

    "it is related to the gauge potential @xmath546 between the two static gauge charges @xmath547 with opposite sign put at the distance @xmath545 as w ( c ) = .",
    "[ eq.98 ] there are two types of behavior of @xmath548 , ( i ) area law : @xmath549 , and ( ii ) perimeter law : @xmath550 , where @xmath551 are constants . in the first case ( i ) , the potential @xmath546 is increasing linearly in @xmath545 , and hence the two gauge charges can never be free",
    ". therefore it corresponds to confinement , while the other case ( ii ) to deconfinement .",
    "it is known that the compact qed ( pure gauge model ) in ( 2 + 1)d is always confining however small the coupling constant is @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on the instanton configuration , which is enabled by the compactness of the gauge field .",
    "this instanton is the source of the flux with the field distribution ( x ) = x .",
    "[ eq.99 ] where @xmath552 is the ( 2 + 1)d coordinates in the imaginary time formalism , and @xmath553 is the combination of the `` electric field '' @xmath554 and `` magnetic field '' @xmath555 .",
    "this corresponds to the tunneling phenomenon of the flux because the total flux slightly above ( future ) or below ( past ) of the instanton differs by @xmath556 .",
    "the anti - instanton corresponds to the sink of the flux .",
    "this instanton / anti - instanton corresponds to the singular configuration in the continuous approximation , but is allowed in the compact model on a lattice . therefore ( anti)instantons take into account the compact nature of the original model in the continuum approximation .",
    "it is also clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq.99 ] ) that the ( anti)instanton behaves as the ( negative ) positive magnetic charge .",
    "then it is evident that when we plug in the ( anti)instanton configurations into the action s= d^3 x 1 [ b(x)]^2 [ eq.100 ] ( @xmath557 is the coupling constant ) , we obtain the coulomb @xmath558-interaction between the ( anti)instantons as s_inst = _ i < j q_i q_j . [ 101 ] where @xmath559 is the magnetic charge , which is @xmath560 for instanton and @xmath561 for anti - instanton .",
    "now it is well - known that the coulomb gas in 3d is always in the screening phase , namely the long range coulomb interaction is screened to be the short range one due to the cloud of the opposite charges surrounding the charge .",
    "therefore the creation energy of the ( anti)instanton is finite and the free magnetic charges are liberated .",
    "this free magnetic charges disorder the gauge field and makes the wilson loop show the area law , confinement .",
    "the discussion up to now is for the pure gauge model without matter field . with matter field",
    "the confinement issue becomes very subtle since the wilson loop does not work as the order parameter any more .",
    "furthermore the confinement disappears above some transition temperature even in the pure gauge model . in the presence of matter field ,",
    "the confinement - deconfinement transition at finite temperature is replaced by the gradual crossover to the plasma phase in the high temperature limit (; ; ) .",
    "therefore we can expect that the slave - boson theory without confinement describes the physics of the intermediate energy scale even though the ground state is the confining state .",
    "indeed , within the @xmath2 gauge theory , the ground states are either antiferromagnetic , superconductor or fermi - liquid and are all confining .",
    "nevertheless , the pseudogap region which exists only at finite temperatures may be considered `` deconfined '' and describable by fermions and bosons coupled to noncompact gauge fields .",
    "we emphasize once again that in this scenario the fermions and bosons are not to be considered free physical objects . their interaction with gauge fields",

    "gauge fluctuations are weak and @xmath569 reduces to the xy model weakly coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field , which exhibits an ordered phase called the higgs phase at zero temperature .",
    "note that in the higgs phase , the gauge field is gapped by the anderson - higgs mechanism . on the other hand",
    ", it is also gapped in the confinement phase due to the screening of magnetic charges described earlier .",
    "there is no easy way to distinguish between these two phases and the central result of fradkin and shenker is that for @xmath570 the higgs phase and the confinement phases are smoothly connected to each other .",
    "indeed , it was argued by that for the 1 + 2d case the entire @xmath0-@xmath557 plane is covered by the higgs - confinement phase , with the exception of the line @xmath571 , which contains the xy transition .",
    "the situation is dramatically different for @xmath572 , if the boson field corresponds to a pairing field .",
    "then it is possible to distinguish between the higgs phase and the confinement phase by asking whether two @xmath573 have a linear confinement potential between them or not . in this case",
    "there is a phase boundary between the confined and the higgs phase , and the higgs phase ( the pairing phase ) is deconfined .",
    "one way of understanding this deconfinement is that the paired phase has a residual @xmath574 gauge symmetry , the pairing order parameter is invariant under a sign change of the underlying @xmath570 fields which make up the pair .",

    "this route ( called the @xmath2 spin liquid ) appears naturally in the @xmath3 formulation and will be discussed in detail in section xi.f .",

    "this is a more attractive scenario compared with the reliance purely on finite temperature to see deconfinement effects as described earlier in this section .    in the literature",
    "there have been some confusing discussions of the role of confinement in the gauge theory approach to strong correlation . in particular , , @xcite has claimed that slave particles are always confined in @xmath2 gauge theories .",
    "his argument is based on the fact that since these gauge fields are introduced to enforce constraint , they do not have restoring force and the coupling constant is infinite .",

    "there is also numerical evidence from monte carlo studies that the @xmath579 hubbard - heisenberg model at @xmath580 exhibits a gapless spin liquid phase , a mott insulator with power law spin correlation without breaking of lattice translation symmetry @xcite .",
    "this spin liquid state is strongly suggestive of the stability of a deconfined phase with @xmath2 gauge field coupled to dirac fermions .      the @xmath2 gauge theory , which only includes gaussian fluctuations about mean field theory , suffers from several limitations which are especially serious in the underdoped regime .",
    "apart from the confinement issue discussed in the last section , we first mention a difficulty with the linear @xmath21 coefficient of the superfluid density . as long as the gauge fluctuation is treated as gaussian , the ioffe - larkin law holds and one predicts that the superfluid density @xmath581 behaves as @xmath582 .",
    "the @xmath583 term agrees with experiment while the @xmath584 term does not (; ) as already explained in section v.a .",
    "this failure is traced to the fact that in the gaussian approximation , the current carried by the quasiparticles in the superconducting state is proportional to @xmath585 .",
    "we believe this failure is a sign that nonperturbative effects again become important and confinement takes place , so that the low energy quasiparticles near the nodes behave like bcs quasiparticles which carry the full current @xmath164 .",
    "this is certainly beyond the gaussian fluctuation treatment described here .",
    "a second difficulty is that experimentally it is known from neutron scattering that spin correlations at @xmath94 are enhanced in the underdoped regime .",
    "this happens at the same time while a spin gap is forming in the pseudogap regime .",
    "the @xmath2 mean field theory explains the existence of the spin gap as due to fermion pairing .",
    "however , this reduces the fermion density of states and it is not clear how one can get an enhancement of the spin correlation unless one introduces phenomenologically rpa interactions @xcite .",
    "the problem is more serious because the gauge field is gapped in the fermion paired state and one can not use gauge fluctuation to enhance the spin correlation .",
    "the gapping of the gauge field also tends to suppress fermion pairing self - consistently @xcite .",
    "we shall see that both these difficulties are resolved by the @xmath3 formulation .",
    "a third difficulty has to do with the structure of the vortex core in the underdoped limit.@xcite as mentioned in section ix.c , the @xmath2 gauge theory predicts the stability of @xmath525 vortices , which has not been observed .",
    "this is a serious issue especially because the stm experiments show that the pseudogap remains in the vortex core",
    ". therefore it should be type b in the @xmath2 theory , which carries @xmath525 flux .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath526 vortex is not `` cheap '' because the pairing amplitude vanishes and one has to pay the pairing energy at the core .",
    "these difficulties arise because in the @xmath2 theory , the fermions becomes `` strong '' superconductor at low temperature in the underdoped region .",
    "however this contradicts with the fact that at half - filling the d - wave rvb state is equivalent to the @xmath275-flux state , which is not `` superconducting '' . in short",
    ", the @xmath2 theory misses the important low lying fluctuation related to the @xmath3 particle - hole symmetry at half - filling . by incorporating this symmetry to the gauge field even at finite doping",
    ", we will be lead to the @xmath3 gauge theory of high tc superconductors , which we will next discuss .",
    "in this section we are going to develop @xmath3 slave - boson theory for spin liquids and underdoped high @xmath5 superconductors .",
    "the @xmath3 slave - boson theory is equivalent to the @xmath2 slave - boson theory discussed in the last section .",
    "however , the @xmath3 formalism makes more symmetries of the slave - boson theory explicit .",
    "this makes it easier to see the low energy collective modes in the @xmath3 formalism , which in turn allows us to resolve some difficulties of the @xmath2 slave - boson theory .",
    "slave - boson theory is incorrect .",
    "the difficulties are results of incorrect treatment of the @xmath2 slave - boson theory , for example , overlooking some low energy soft modes . ] to develop the @xmath3 slave - boson theory , let us first describe another way to understand the @xmath2 gauge fluctuations in the slave - boson theory . in this section we will concentrate on undoped case where the model is just a pure spin system .",
    "even though the theory involves only fermionic representation of the spin in the underdoped case , we continue to refer to the theory as slave - boson theory in anticipation of the doped case .",
    "we generalize the @xmath3 salve - boson theory to doped model in the next section .      according to the @xmath2 slave - boson mean - field theory ,",
    "the fluctuations around the mean - field ground state are described by gauge fields and fermion fields .",
    "remember that the original model is just a interacting spin model which is a purely bosonic model . how can a purely bosonic model contain excitations described by gauge fields and fermion fields ?",
    "should we believe the result ?",
    "let us examine how the results are obtained .",
    "we first split the bosonic spin operator into a product of two fermionic operators @xmath586 .",
    "we then introduce a gauge field to glue the fermions back into a bosonic spin . from this point of view",
    "it appears that the gauge bosons and the fermions are fake and their appearance is just a mathematical artifact .",
    "the appearance of the fermion field and gauge field in a purely bosonic model seems only indicates that the slave - boson theory is incorrect .",
    "however , we should not discard the slave - boson mean - field theory too quickly .",
    "it is actually capable of producing pictures that agree with the common sense : the excitations in a bosonic spin system are bosonic excitations corresponding to spin flips , provided that the gauge field is in a confining phase . in the confining phase of the @xmath2 gauge theory , the fermions interact with each other through a linear potential and can never appear as quasiparticles at low energies .",
    "the gauge bosons have a large energy gap in the confining phase and are absent from the low energy spectrum .",
    "the only low energy excitations are bound state of two fermions which carry spin-1 and are bosons .",
    "so the mean - field theory plus the gauge fluctuations , may not be very useful , but is not wrong .",
    "on the other hand , the slave - boson mean - field theory ( plus gauge fluctuations ) is also capable of producing pictures that defy the common senses , if the gauge field is in a deconfined phase . in this case",
    "the fermions and gauge bosons may appear as well defined quasiparticles .",
    "the question is do we believe the picture of deconfined phase ?",
    "do we believe the possibility of emergent gauge bosons and fermions from a purely bosonic model ? clearly , the slave - boson construction outlined above is far too formal to convince most people to believe such drastic results .",
    "however , recently , it was realized that some models @xcite can be solved by the slave - boson theory exactly @xcite .",
    "those models are in deconfined phases and confirm the striking results of emergence of gauge bosons and fermions from the slave - boson theory .    to have an intuitive picture of the correlated ground state which leads to emergent gauge bosons and fermions ,",
    "let us try to understand how a mean - field ansatz @xmath271 is connected to a physical spin wave function .",
    "we know that the ground state , @xmath587 , of the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath588 is not a valid wavefunction for the spin system , since it may not have one fermion per site .",
    "to connect to physical spin wavefunction , we need to include fluctuations of @xmath441 to enforce the one - fermion - per - site constraint . with this understanding ,",
    "we may obtain a valid wave - function of the spin system @xmath589 by projecting the mean - field state to the subspace of one - fermion - per - site : @xmath590 where @xmath591 is the state with no @xmath592-fermions : @xmath593 . eq .",

    "it allows us to understand the physical meaning of the mean - field ansatz and mean - field fluctuations .",
    "for example , the projection give the gauge transformation a physical meaning .",
    "usually , for different choices of @xmath271 , the ground states of @xmath594 correspond to different mean - field wavefunctions @xmath587 .",
    "after projection they lead to different physical spin wavefunctions @xmath595 .",
    "thus we can regard @xmath271 as labels that label different physical spin states .",
    "however , two mean - field ansatz @xmath596 and @xmath597 related by a gauge transformation @xmath598 give rise to the same physical spin state after the projection @xmath599 thus @xmath596 is not a one - to - one label , but a many - to - one label .",
    "this property is important for us to understand the unusual dynamical properties of @xmath271 fluctuations . using many labels to label the same physical state",
    "also make our theory a gauge theory .",
    "let us consider how the many - to - one property or the gauge structure of @xmath271 affect its dynamical properties .",
    "if @xmath271 was an one - to - one label of physical states , then @xmath271 would be like the condensed boson amplitude @xmath600 in boson superfluid or the condensed spin moment @xmath601 in sdw state .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath271 would correspond to a bosonic mode similar to sound mode or spin - wave mode .",
    "however , @xmath271 does not behave like local order parameters , such as @xmath600 and @xmath601 , which label physical states without redundancy .",
    "@xmath271 is a many - to - one label as discussed above .",
    "the many - to - one label creates a interesting situation when we consider the fluctuations of @xmath596  some fluctuations of @xmath596 do not change the physical state and are unphysical .",
    "those fluctuations are called the pure gauge fluctuations . the effective theory for @xmath271",
    "must be gauge invariant : for example , the energy for the ansatz @xmath271 satisfies @xmath602 if we consider the phase fluctuations of @xmath603 , then the energy for the fluctuations @xmath604 satisfies @xmath605 this gauge invariant property of the energy ( or more precisely , the action ) drastically change the dynamical properties of the fluctuations .",
    "it is this property that makes fluctuations of @xmath606 behave like gauge bosons , which are very different from sound mode and spin - wave mode .",
    "if we believe that gauge bosons and fermions do appear as low energy excitations in the deconfined phase , then a natural question will be what do those excitations looks like ?",
    "the slave - boson construction allows us to construct an explicit physical spin wavefunction that corresponds to a gauge fluctuation @xmath604 @xmath607 thus the @xmath2 gauge fluctuations @xmath604 , or more precisely the flux of @xmath2 gauge fluctuations @xmath608 , correspond to the fluctuations of the spin chirality @xmath609 as pointed out in the last section .",
    "similarly , the slave - boson construction also allows us to construct a physical spin wavefunction that corresponds to a pair of the fermion excitations .",
    "we start with the mean - field ground state with a pair of particle - hole excitations . after the projection",

    "the form of the interaction is determined by the fact that the fermions carry unit charge of the @xmath2 gauge field .",

    "we have mentioned that the collective fluctuations around the a slave - boson mean - field ground state are described by @xmath2 gauge field . here",
    "we would like to ask why the gauge group is @xmath2 ?",

    "this is because the mean - field ansatz are many - to - one labels of the physical spin state , the non - invariance of the ansatz does not imply the non - invariance of the corresponding physical spin state after the projection .",
    "we only require the mean - field ansatz to be invariant up to a @xmath3 gauge transformation in order for the projected physical spin state to have a symmetry .",
    "for example , a @xmath669 parity transformation changes the sfl ansatz to @xmath678 the reflected ansatz can be transformed into the original ansatz via a @xmath3 gauge transformation @xmath679 .",

    "should we trust the mean - field results from the slave - boson theory ?",
    "the answer is that it depends on the importance of the gauge fluctuations . unlike usual mean - field theory ,",
    "the fluctuations in the slave - boson theory include gauge fluctuations which can generate confining interactions between the fermions . in this case",
    "the gauge interactions represent relevant perturbations and the mean - field state is said to be unstable . the mean - field results from an unstable mean - field ansatz",
    "can not be trusted and can not be applied to real physical spin state . in particular , the spin-1/2 fermionic excitations in the mean - field theory in this case will not appear in the physical spectrum of real spin state .",
    "if the dynamics of the gauge fluctuations is such that the gauge interaction is short ranged , then the gauge interactions represent irrelevant perturbations and can be ignored . in this case",

    "we have seen that the key to understand the physical properties of a spin liquid described by a mean - field ansatz @xmath690 is to understand the dynamics of the @xmath3 gauge fluctuations . to gain some intuitive understanding ,",

    "such a transformation rotates the direction of the vector @xmath711 . since the direction of the @xmath3 flux for loops with different base point can be rotated independently by the local @xmath3 gauge transformations , it is meaningless to directly compare the directions of @xmath3 flux for different base points .",
    "however , it is quite meaningful to compare the directions of @xmath3 flux for loops with the same base point .",
    "we can divide different @xmath3 flux configurations into three classes based on the @xmath3 flux through loops with the _ same _ base point : ( a ) trivial @xmath3 flux where all @xmath715 , ( b ) collinear @xmath3 flux where all the @xmath3 fluxes point in the same direction , and ( c ) non - collinear @xmath3 flux where @xmath3 flux for loops with the same base point are in different directions .",

    "the mass term @xmath722 is not invariant under such a transformation and is thus not allowed .",
    "similarly , we can show that none of the mass terms @xmath722 , @xmath723 , and @xmath724 are allowed in the expansion of @xmath694 .",

    "the spin liquids studied in this paper all contain some kind of low energy gauge fluctuations . despite their different low energy gauge groups ,",
    "all those spin liquids can be constructed from any one of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , or @xmath574 slave - boson approaches .",
    "after all , all those slave - boson approaches describe the same heisenberg model and are equivalent .",
    "the high energy gauge group is related to the way in which we write down the hamiltonian .",
    "we can write hamiltonian of the heisenberg model in many different ways which can contain arbitrary high energy gauge group of our choice .",
    "we just need to split the spin into two , four , six , or some other even numbers of fermions . while the low energy gauge group is a property of ground state of the spin model .",

    ", it was shown that if we break the time reversal symmetry in a 2d spin-1/2 model , then the @xmath2 gauge field from the slave - boson approach can be in a deconfined phase due to the appearance of chern - simons term (; ) .",

    "therefore , the results in and are valid for the triangular - lattice dimer model and deconfined quasiparticles do emerge in a dimer liquid on triangular lattice .",
    "all the above models with emergent fermions are 2d models , where the emergent fermions can be understood from binding flux to a charged particle @xcite .",

    "the charged gapless excitations can screen the gauge interaction to make it less confining .",

    "this led to a conclusion in that the asl described by the sfl state does not exist . the easiest way to understand the screening effect of the 3d coulomb gas is to note that the partition function of the coulomb gas can be written as a path integral @xmath975 if we integrate out short distance fluctuations of @xmath309 , a counter term @xmath976 can be generated .",

    "the latter are instanton creation operators which restore the compactness of the gauge field . among the first type",
    "there are four fermion terms which are readily seen to be irrelevant , but as mentioned earlier , the dangerous term is the quadratic fermion mass term .",
    "the important point is that the mass terms are forbidden by the special symmetry described by psg .",
    "the discrete symmetry ( such as translation and rotation ) of the sfl state defined on the lattice imposes certain symmetry on the continuum dirac field which forbids the mass term .",
    "another way of seeing this is that after integrating out the short distance fluctuations , if a mass term is generated it can be described in the lattice model as a deformation of the mean - field ansatz @xmath978 .",
    "since the short distance fluctuations are perturbative in nature , the deformation @xmath978 can not change the symmetry of the ansatz @xmath979 that describe the ground state , if @xmath979 is invariant under a psg , @xmath978 must be invariant under the same psg . one can show that for all the possible deformations that are invariant under the sfl psg described by , none of them can generate the mass term for the fermions .",
    "thus the masslessness of the fermions are protected by the sfl psg .    as for the second type of operators which change the flux , appeal to a result in conformal field theory which relates the scaling dimension of such operators to the eigenvalues of states on a sphere with a magnetic flux through the surface @xcite .",
    "this is easily bound by the ground state energy of @xmath977 component dirac fermions on the sphere which clearly scale as @xmath212 .",
    "thus the creation of instantons is also irrelevant for sufficiently large @xmath212 .",

    "a better approach is to renormalize the monopoles and the fermions on the same footing , let the infrared cutoff length scale for the fermion @xmath981 and the monopoles @xmath982 to approach infinity with a fixed ratio , e.g. @xmath983",

    "neutron scattering is a more definitive probe , because one can use the form factor to distinguish between orbital and spin effects .",
    "however , due to the small expected intensity , neutron scattering has so far not yielded any definite results .",
    "as discussed in section xi.e , we expect enhanced @xmath134 fluctuations to be associated with the staggered flux liquid phase .",

    "we emphasize the @xmath23-flux liquid state is our way of producing antiferromagnetic order starting from microscopies and hence is fully consistent with the appearance of static or dynamical antiferromagnetism in the vortex core .",
    "our hope is that gauge fluctuations ( including instanton effects ) are sufficiently reduced in doped systems to permit a glimpse of the staggered orbital current .",
    "the detection of such currently fluctuations will be a strong confirmation of our approach .",
    "finally , we note that orbital current does not show up directly in stm experiments , which are sensitive to the local density of states .",
    "however , have considered the possibility of interference between wannier orbitals on neighboring lattice sites , which could lead to modulations of stm signals _ between _ lattice positions .",
    "stm experiments have detected @xmath104 modulated patterns in the vortex core region and also in certain underdoped regions .",
    "such patterns appear to require density modulations which are in addition to our vortex model .",
    "we can now construct a phase diagram of the underdoped cuprates starting from the @xmath4-wave superconductor ground state at low temperatures .",

    "the @xmath3 gauge theory provides a mechanism for cheap vortices which are necessary for a bkt description , as discussed in section v.b .",
    "if the core energy is too large , the system will behave like a superconductor on any reasonable length scale above @xmath1044 , which is not in accord with experiment . on the other hand ,",

    "they assume an @xmath23-flux core and estimate the energy from projected wavefunction calculations .",
    "they indeed found that there is a large range of temperature above the bkt transition where vortices grow in number but still maintain their identity .",
    "this forms a region in the phase diagram which may be called the nernst region shown in fig .",
    "[ nernst ] . the corresponding picture of the @xmath1024 vector fluctuation is shown in fig .",
    "[ isospin ] . above the nernst region",
    "the @xmath1024 vector is strongly fluctuating and is almost isotopic .",
    "this is the strongly disordered phase of the @xmath383-model .",
    "the vortices have lost their identity and indeed the @xmath383-model description which assumes well defined phases of @xmath817 and @xmath818 begin to break down .",
    "nevertheless , the energy gap associated with the fermions remains .",

    "this is understood as the @xmath2 spin liquid .",
    "there is no order parameter in the usual sense associated with this phase , as all fluctuations including staggered orbital currents and @xmath4-wave pairing become short range .",
    "is there a way to characterize this state of affairs other than the term spin liquid ?",

    "( c )  the pseudogap corresponds to a completely disordered arrangement of @xmath1024 .",
    "( @xmath1024 is a three dimensional vector and only a two dimensional projection is shown . ) , width=240 ]      pointed out that if the pseudogap region is controlled by the @xmath2 spin liquid fixed point , it is possible to characterize this region in a certain precise way . the spin liquid is a de - confined state , meaning that instantons are irrelevant .",
    "then the @xmath2 gauge flux is a conserved quantity .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to couple to this gauge flux using conventional probes .",
    "we note that the flux associated with the @xmath1045 gauge field is _ different _ from the @xmath2 gauge flux considered in section ix , which had the meaning of spin chirality . in the case",
    "where the bosons are locally condensed and their local phase well defined , it is possible to identify the gauge flux in terms of the local phase variables .",
    "the gauge magnetic field @xmath1046 is given by & = & ( v^3)_z + & = & _ x _ y [ eq.165 ] where = ( , , ) . with @xmath1043 and @xmath918",
    "defined in .",
    "note that the azimuthal angle associated with @xmath1047 is now the pairing phase @xmath166 , in contrast with the vector @xmath1024 we considered earlier .",
    "the gauge flux is thus related to the local pairing and @xmath23-flux order as = ( v_z v)_z [ eq.166 ] and it is easily checked that the vortex structure described in section xii.c contains a half integer gauge flux .",
    "in the superconducting state the gauge flux is localized in the vortex core and fluctuations between @xmath1041 half integer vortices are possible via instantons , because the instanton action is finite .",
    "the superconductor is in a confined phase as far as the @xmath2 gauge field is concerned .",
    "as the temperature is raised towards the pseudogap phase this gauge field leaks out of the vortex cores and begins to fluctuate more and more homogeneously .    the asymptotic conservation of the gauge flux at the mott transition fixed point potentially provides some possibilities for its detection .",
    "at non - zero temperatures in the non - superconducting regions , the flux conservation is only approximate ( as the instanton fugacity is small but non - zero ) . nevertheless at low enough temperature",
    "the conserved flux will propagate diffusively over a long range of length and time scales .",
    "thus there should be an extra diffusive mode that is present at low temperatures in the non - superconducting state .",
    "it is however not clear how to design a probe that will couple to this diffusive mode at present .",
    "alternately the vortex structure described above provides a useful way to create and then detect the gauge flux in the non - superconducting normal state .",
    "we will first describe this by ignoring the instantons completely in the normal state .",
    "the effects of instantons will then be discussed .",
    "consider first a large disc of cuprate material which is such that the doping level changes as a function of the radial distance from the center as shown in fig .",
    "[ u1ft1 ] .",
    "the outermost annulus has the largest doping @xmath1048 .",
    "the inner annulus has a lower doping level @xmath1049 .",

    "we also imagine that the thickness @xmath1053 of the outer and inner annuli are both much smaller than the penetration depth for the physical vector potential @xmath1054 .",
    "the penetration depth of the internal gauge field @xmath434 is expected to be small and we expect it will be smaller than @xmath1053 .",
    "we also imagine that the radius of this inner annulus @xmath1055 is a substantial fraction of the radius @xmath1056 of the outer annulus .    .",
    "the inner annulus ( in light blue ) has a smaller @xmath5 .",
    "the rest of the sample ( in brown ) has even smaller @xmath5 .",
    ", width=192 ]    now consider the following set of operations on such a sample .",
    "\\(i ) first cool in a magnetic field to a temperature @xmath1057 such that @xmath1058 .",
    "the outer ring will then go superconducting while the rest of the sample stays normal . in the presence of the field",
    "the outer ring will condense into a state in which there is a net vorticity on going around the ring",
    ". we will be interested in the case where this net vorticity is an odd multiple of the basic @xmath526 vortex .",
    "if as assumed the physical penetration depth is much bigger than the thickness @xmath1059 then the physical magnetic flux enclosed by the ring will not be quantized .",
    "\\(ii ) now consider turning off the external magnetic field .",
    "the vortex present in the outer superconducting ring will stay ( manifested as a small circulating persistent current ) and will give rise to a small magnetic field . as explained above",
    "if the vorticity is odd , then it must be associated with a flux of the internal gauge field that is @xmath1060 .",
    "this internal gauge flux must essentially all be in the inner ` normal ' region of the sample with very small penetration into the outer superconducting ring .",
    "it will spread out essentially evenly over the full inner region .",
    "we have thus managed to create a configuration with a non - zero internal gauge flux in the non - superconducting state .",
    "\\(iii ) how do we detect the presence of this internal gauge flux ?",
    "for that imagine now cooling the sample further to a temperature @xmath1061 such that @xmath1062 . then the inner ring will also go superconducting .",
    "this is to be understood as the condensation of the two boson species @xmath1063 . but",
    "this condensation occurs in the presence of some internal gauge flux .",
    "when the bosons @xmath1063 condense in the inner ring , they will do so in a manner that quantizes the internal gauge flux enclosed by this inner ring into an integer multiple of @xmath275 .",
    "if as assumed the inner radius is a substantial fraction of the outer radius then the net internal gauge flux will prefer the quantized values @xmath1060 rather than be zero ( see below ) .",
    "however configurations of the inner ring that enclose quantized internal gauge flux of @xmath1060 also necessarily contain a physical vortex that is an odd multiple of @xmath526 . with the thickness of the inner ring being smaller than the physical penetration depth",
    ", most of the physical magnetic flux will escape .",
    "there will still be a small residual physical flux due to the current in the inner ring associated with the induced vortex .",
    "this residual physical magnetic flux can then be detected .",
    "note that the sign of the induced physical flux is independent of the sign of the initial magnetic field .",
    "furthermore the effect obtains only if the initial vorticity in the outer ring is odd .",
    "if on the other hand the initial vorticity is even the associated internal gauge flux is zero , and there will be no induced physical flux when the inner ring goes superconducting .",
    "the preceding discussion ignores any effects of instantons .",
    "in contrast to a bulk vortex in the superconducting state the vortices in the set - up above have macroscopic cores . the internal gauge flux is therefore distributed over a region of macroscopic size .",
    "consequently if instantons are irrelevant at long scales in the normal state , their rate may be expected to be small . at any non - zero temperature ( as in the proposed experiment ) there will be a non - zero instanton rate which will be small for small temperature .",
    "when such instantons are allowed then the internal gauge flux created in the sample after step ( ii ) will fluctuate between the values @xmath1064 and @xmath1065 .",
    "however so long as the time required to form the physical vortex in step ( iii ) , which we expect to be short electronic time scale , is much shorter than the inverse of the instanton rate we expect that the effect will be seen .",
    "since the cooling is assumed slow enough that the system always stays in equilibrium , the outcome of the experiment is determined by thermodynamic considerations . estimated the energies of the various stages of the operation and concluded that for sample diameters under a micron and sufficiently low temperatures (= 10 k ) , such an experiment may be feasible .",
    "in this review we have summarized a large body of work which views high temperature superconductivity as the problem of doping of a mott insulator . we have argued that the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , supplemented by @xmath49 terms , contains the essence of the physics .",
    "we offer as evidence numerical work based on the projected trial wavefunctions , which correctly predicts the @xmath4-wave pairing ground state and a host of properties such as the superfluid density and the quasiparticle spectral weight and dispersion .",
    "analytic theory hinges on the treatment of the constraint of no double occupation .",
    "the redundancy in the representations used to enforce the constraint naturally leads to various gauge theories .",
    "we argue that with doping , the gauge theory may be in a deconfined phase , in which case the slave - boson and fermion degrees of freedom , which were introduced as mathematical devices , take on a physical meaning in that they are sensible starting points to describe physical phenomena .",
    "however , even in the deconfined phase , the coupling to gauge fluctuations is still of order unity and approximation schemes ( such as large @xmath212 expansion ) are needed to calculate physical properties such as spin correlation and electron spectral function .",
    "these results qualitatively capture the physics of the pseudogap phase , but certainly not at a quantitative level .",
    "nevertheless , our picture of the vortex structure and how they proliferate gives us a reasonable account of the phase diagram and the onset of @xmath5 .",
    "one direction of future research is to refine the treatment of the low energy effective model , fermions and bosons coupled to gauge fields , and attempt more detailed comparison with experiments such as photoemission lineshapes , . on the other hand , it is worthwhile to step back and take a broader perspective .",
    "what is really new and striking about the high temperature superconductors is the strange `` normal '' metallic state for underdoped samples . the carrier density is small and",
    "the fermi surface is broken up by the appearance of a pseudogap near @xmath88 and @xmath1066 , leaving a `` fermi arc '' near the nodal points .",
    "all this happens without doubling of the unit cell via breaking translation or spin rotation symmetry .",
    "how this state comes into being in a lightly doped mott insulator is the crux of the problem .",
    "we can distinguish between two classes of answers .",
    "the first , perhaps the more conventional one , postulates the existence of a symmetry - breaking state which gaps the fermi surface , and further assumes that thermal fluctuation prevents this state from ordering .",
    "a natural candidate for the state is the superconducting state itself .",
    "however , it now appears that phase fluctuations of a superconductor can explain the pseudogap phenomenon only over a relatively narrow temperature range , which we called the nernst regime .",
    "alternatively , a variety of competing states which have nothing to do with superconductivity have been proposed , often on a phenomenological level , to produce the pseudogap .",
    "we shall refer to this class of theory as `` thermal '' explanation of the pseudogap .    a second class of answer , which we may dub the `` quantum '' explanation , proposes that the pseudogap is connected with a fundamentally new quantum state .",
    "thus , despite its appearance at high temperatures , it is argued that it is a high frequency phenomenon which is best understood quantum mechanically .",
    "the gauge theory reviewed here belongs to this class , and views the pseudogap state as derived from a new state of matter , the quantum spin liquid state .",
    "the spin liquid state is connected to the nel state at half filling by confinement . at the same time , with doping a @xmath4-wave superconducting ground state is naturally produced .",
    "we argue that rather than following the route taken by the cuprate in the laboratory of evolving directly from the antiferromagnet to the superconductor , it is better conceptually to start from the spin liquid state and consider how af and superconductivity develop from it . in this view",
    "the pseudogap is the closest we can get to obtaining a glimpse of the spin liquid which up to now is unstable in the square lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "is there a `` smoking gun '' signature to prove or disprove the validity of this line of theory ?",
    "our approach is to make specific predictions as much as possible in the hope of stimulating experimental work .",
    "this is the reason we make special emphasis on the staggered flux liquid with its orbital current fluctuations , because it is a unique signature which may be experimentally detectable .",
    "our predictions range from new collective modes in the superconducting state , to quasi - static order in the vortex core .",
    "unfortunately the physical manifestation of the orbital current is a very weak magnetic field , which is difficult to detect , and to date we have not found experimental verification . besides orbital current , we also propose an experiment involving flux generation in a special geometry .",
    "this experiment addresses the fundamental issue of the quantum spin liquid as the origin of the pseudogap phase .",
    "the pseudogap metallic state is so strange that at the beginning , it is not clear if a microscopic description is even possible .",
    "so the microscopic description provided by the @xmath3 slave - boson theory , although still relatively qualitative , represents important progress and leads to some deep insights .",
    "a key finding is that the parent spin liquid is a new state of matter that can not be described by landau s symmetry breaking theory .",
    "the description of the parent spin liquid , such as the @xmath3 slave - boson theory , must involve gauge theory .",
    "even if one starts with an ordered phase and later uses quantum fluctuations to restore the symmetry , the resulting description of the symmetry restored state , if found , appears to always contain gauge fields @xcite .",
    "thus the appearance of the gauge field in the quantum description of the pseudogap metal is not a mathematical artifact of the slave - boson theory .",
    "it is a consequence of a new type of correlations in those states .",
    "the new type of correlations represents a new type of order @xcite , which make those states different from the familiar states described by landau s symmetry breaking theory .    from this perspective",
    ", the study of high temperature superconductivity may have a much broader and deeper impact than merely understanding high temperature superconductivity .",
    "such a study is actually a study of new states of matter .",
    "it represents our entry into a new exciting world that lies beyond landau s world of symmetry breaking .",
    "hopefully the new states of matter may be discovered in some materials other than high temperature superconductors . the slave - boson theory and the resulting gauge theory developed for high temperature superconductivity may be useful for these new states of matter once they are discovered in experiments .",
    "[ examples of these new states of matter have already been discovered in many theoretical toy models (; ; ; ) .",
    "] at the moment , gauge theory is the only known language to describe this new state of affairs .",
    "we believe the introduction of this subject to condensed matter physics has enriched the field and will lead to may interesting further developments ."
