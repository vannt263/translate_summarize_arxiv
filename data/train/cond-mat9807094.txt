    "studies on the microscopic mechanism of high - t@xmath4 superconductivity and of the colossal magnetoresistance have shown the need for a more detailed investigation of simple models for the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "one generic model is the holstein model @xcite which consists of conduction electrons interacting locally with optical phonons .",
    "the case of just one electron has received a lot of attention in the past . in particular , the formation of small and large polarons and their motions have been studied considering both the adiabatic and the anti - adiabatic cases @xcite .",
    "however , the application of the obtained results to high - t@xmath4 superconductors @xcite or to the manganites@xcite is problematic . in these systems",
    "the fermi energy @xmath3 is substantially larger than typical phonon energies @xmath2 .",
    "one thus deals in these systems with a large fermi surface where the migdal - eliashberg @xcite self - consistent perturbation theory , governed by the small parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath0 is the electron - phonon coupling constant ) , should be more appropriate than the use of canonical transformations typical for the one - electron problem .    from the studies on the single polaron problem",
    "it is known that polaron formation , i.e. , the sudden and large mass enhancement of the electron , takes place around @xmath6 .",
    "associated with this is a breakdown of simple perturbation theory due to the appearance of a bound state in the electron - phonon system .",
    "whether something similar happens in the case of many electrons and a large fermi surface is still a matter of controversy . on the one hand , it has been argued that , due to the migdal theorem , self - consistent theory works even if @xmath0 is not small . it is claimed that the only condition for the validity of the self - consistent perturbation theory is that @xmath7 holds @xcite . as a result many treatments in the past , for instance , for high - t@xmath4 superconductors , used values for @xmath0 which are much larger than 1 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been claimed that migdal - eliashberg perturbation theory breaks down if @xmath0 exceeds a critical value somewhere between 1 and 2 , irrespective of the electronic density and the size of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the arguments for this , however , were based on the lang - firsov transformation @xcite which is more appropriate in the anti - adiabatic than in the adiabatic limit and they seem to be supported by numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "one aim of our contribution is to study the possible breakdown of migdal - eliashberg perturbation theory and polaron formation in the adiabatic regime where the hopping and the fermi energy are much larger than the phonon energies .",
    "another aim is the calculation of phonon renormalization effects caused by an arbitrarily strong electron - phonon coupling .    a suitable method to study the above problem is the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "this method becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "it allows to map the lattice problem onto anderson s single impurity problem embedded in an effective bath created by all the other sites and interacting with the electrons on the impurity in a dynamical , time - dependent way . in spite of the substantial simplifications introduced by infinite dimensions the resulting equations are in general still too complicated to admit exact analytic solutions . for the holstein model",
    "some results from monte carlo simulations are available @xcite .",
    "various approximate treatments have also been performed such as iterated perturbation theory @xcite , self - consistent perturbation theory @xcite and the semiclassical approximation @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will formulate the dynamical mean - field equations in terms of path integrals .",
    "the phonon coordinate will not be treated as a classical variable without dynamics as in the semiclassical approach .",
    "instead , we expand the path integrals around the paths which extremize the action . for small @xmath0 there is only one extremal and trivial path and migdal - eliashberg expansion is valid . beyond a critical value for @xmath0 more than one extremal paths exist signalizing the breakdown of migdal - eliashberg",
    "theory though the system is still in the metallic state .",
    "our treatment can be applied in the adiabatic regime to all coupling strengths @xmath0 and contains correctly the weak- and the strong - coupling cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the model and the dynamical mean - field equations are formulated .",
    "in section iii the electrons are approximately integrated out in the path integral using a gradient expansion in time .",
    "the resulting effective action for the atoms is discussed .",
    "approximate expressions for the electron green s function are obtained in section iv .",
    "section v contains numerical results for a bethe lattice both for the atomic and the electronic properties .",
    "this section illustrates in detail the evolution of basic quantities of the dynamical mean field theory such as the local green s function , the electronic self - energy , the effective `` unperturbed '' green s function and the effective atomic potential as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , section vi contains the conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian for the holstein model can be written as@xcite    @xmath8    it describes a system of electrons interacting locally with dispersionless phonons . @xmath9",
    "denote the sites of a lattice , @xmath10 is the frequency of the phonons , @xmath11 is the hopping matrix element of the electrons , and @xmath12 the coupling constant between electrons and phonons .",
    "@xmath13 is the displacement operator of the atom at site @xmath14 which can be expressed in terms of bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath15 as @xmath16 @xmath17 are creation and annihilation operators for electrons at site @xmath14 and spin direction @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the density operator of electrons . the partition function of the model can be written as a path integral over anticommutating grassmann numbers @xmath20 ( replacing the electronic operators ) , and phonon fields ,    @xmath21}},\\ ] ]    where s is the action associated with the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .    in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath22 ,",
    "the dynamical mean - field approximation for @xmath23 becomes exact . as a result the many - body problem eq.(1 ) can be mapped onto an impurity model embedded in a dynamical bath @xcite . denoting the one - electron green s function associated with the hamiltonian of eq.(1 ) by @xmath24 , the self - energy @xmath25 is defined via",
    "dyson s equation @xmath26 @xmath27 is the free electron green s function associated with the hopping term in eq.(1 ) .",
    "using the matsubara formalism @xmath28 are fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath29 where n is an integer and @xmath30 the temperature . a very important simplification in infinite dimensions results from the fact that the self - energy @xmath25 is independent of the momentum @xmath31 and depends only on the frequency @xcite .",
    "the self - energy @xmath25 also represents the self - energy of a site - independent impurity problem with the effective action @xmath32 given by @xmath33    @xmath34 describes a dynamical effective field acting on the impurity electrons due to the presence of all the other electrons in the crystal .",
    "it plays the role of a bare green s function in @xmath32 and contains all the information on the influence of the surroundings on the impurity electrons .",
    "@xmath35 in eq.(5 ) stands for the inverse temperature @xmath36 . denoting the exact one - electron green s function associated with @xmath32 by @xmath37 dyson s equation of the impurity problem reads @xmath38",
    "finally , the so far unknown function @xmath34 is determined by the condition that @xmath37 coincides with the local green s function calculated from the lattice green s function @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 @xmath41 is the bare chemical potential and @xmath42 is the bare density of electron states associated with the original hopping term in eq.(1 ) . in the following",
    "we will mainly consider the semicircular density of states of the bethe lattice @xcite given by @xmath43 this lattice has an infinite coordination number @xmath44 and a rescaled nearest - neighbor hopping term @xmath45 . in this particular case",
    "the relation between @xmath46 and @xmath37 becomes @xmath47 another popular density of states function is that of the lorentz model @xmath48 it describes a model with infinite range hopping terms and a function @xmath34 which simply is given by    @xmath49    @xmath34 decouples in this case from all the other quantities .",
    "this model is therefore especially simple allowing often analytic expressions which capture essential features of models with more realistic density of states functions .",
    "on the other hand it misses the feedback from the other quantities and thus is unable to describe , for instance , the mott - hubbard transition from a metal to an insulator .",
    "eqs.(5)-(7 ) represent a closed set of equations .",
    "they have been derived under the assumption that no long - range order is present which will be assumed in the following .",
    "the above equations can be solved for large regions in parameter space numerically using monte carlo or diagonalization methods @xcite . in the following",
    "we will use a more analytic method which gives directly some insight into the underlying physics .",
    "according to eq.(5 ) @xmath32 is bilinear in the electronic variables .",
    "this means that the integration over electrons in the partition function eq.(3 ) can be carried out yielding the following action @xmath50 for the phonon field alone : @xmath51 here @xmath52 means the trace over electronic variables , i.e. , an integration over @xmath53 from @xmath54 to @xmath35 and a sum over the two spin components .",
    "the argument of the logarithm in eq.(12 ) is a nondiagonal matrix consisting of the non - diagonal part @xmath55 and the diagonal part @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , in @xmath28-space the first contribution @xmath55 would be diagonal but the second one , @xmath56 would become non - diagonal .",
    "defining the expectation value of @xmath56 in the usual way by @xmath57 with @xmath58 there is no reason to expect that this static expectation value is zero even in the half - filled case . indeed , writing down the equation of motion of heisenberg operators using the original hamiltonian eq.(1 ) and considering the static limit we have @xmath59 @xmath60 is the average number of electrons per site .",
    "it is therefore convenient to split @xmath56 into a static and a fluctuation part according to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is defined by the condition @xmath63 .",
    "this shift can be interpreted as a hartree term @xmath64 in the self - energy of @xmath34 . since this term is frequency independent it just renormalizes the bare chemical potential as @xmath65 from now on",
    "we will assume that this shift has been performed and that the chemical potential in @xmath34 is @xmath66 and no longer the bare one @xmath41 .",
    "the main problem left is the evaluation of the @xmath67 term in eq.(12 ) . for this",
    "we note that two independent parameters can be naturally defined in the holstein model : one is the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath68 , and the other one is the adiabatic parameter @xmath69 .",
    "the adiabatic regime is defined by @xmath70 , corresponding to the situation where the electrons move much faster than the phonons . for the calculation of the @xmath67 term",
    "we assume that @xmath71 holds .",
    "@xmath72 varies then slowly as function of @xmath53 compared with the variations in the electronic coordinates . an expansion in time gradients of @xmath73 represents thus an expansion in the migdal parameter @xmath74 and we can confine ourselves to the lowest - order contributions .    expanding the @xmath67 term in powers of @xmath12 one obtains @xmath75",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of eq.(18 ) is independent of @xmath72 and thus will be dropped in the following . writing the conservation of frequencies explicitly by means of a delta - function",
    "the general term of n - th order in @xmath12 of the @xmath76 term becomes @xmath77 the prefactor 2 in eq.(19 ) is due to the sum over the two spin directions . due to the delta - function",
    "there are no restrictions in the sums over @xmath78 in eq.(19 ) .",
    "for @xmath70 the motion of the atoms is slow compared to that of the electrons . in leading order in @xmath74 the electrons interact thus elastically with the phonons , i.e. , they see the momentary value of the phonon field as a static field .",
    "this means that the phonon frequencies @xmath78 can be neglected in the electron propagators @xmath34 .",
    "the sums over @xmath78 can then trivially be carried out in eq.(19 ) .",
    "summing also over @xmath79 and adding the shifted harmonic potential the total potential @xmath80 in @xmath50 becomes in this local approximation @xmath81 in the last term in eq.(20 ) we have added an exponential in order to regularize the sum over matsubara frequencies correctly .",
    "this regularization affects only the first - order term in @xmath12 .",
    "we found that it is not advisable in general to carry out the frequency sum in eq.(20 ) directly on the computer but to rewrite it as a contour integral in the complex plane and to evaluate it as an integral along the cut on the real frequency axis .",
    "one obtains in this way @xmath82 here @xmath83 denotes the fermi function , @xmath84 and @xmath85 real and imaginary parts , respectively , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 the theta- and sign - functions , respectively . in the case of the lorentz model",
    "the integral in eq.(21 ) can be performed analytically and one obtains at zero temperature :    @xmath88 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a conventional way to calculate corrections to the above local terms is to use a gradient expansion @xcite .",
    "one expands then the propagators in powers of frequencies @xmath89 and rewrites these powers in terms of time derivatives acting on the field @xmath72 .",
    "such a procedure is , however , not possible in our case because of the appearance of nonanalytic terms . to see this",
    "let us first look at the lowest - order term @xmath90 :    @xmath91    with @xmath92 using the spectral representation @xmath93 and carrying out the integrations one obtains at small frequencies and low temperatures and also disregarding a constant term @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the spectral function at the chemical potential @xmath96 .",
    "considering @xmath97 as an self - energy contribution to the unperturbed phonon propagator in eq.(12 ) and performing the analytic continuation @xmath98 , one recognizes that @xmath97 describes the damping of phonons which is smaller than the phonon frequency @xmath2 by the migdal paramter @xmath74 .",
    "eq.(26 ) shows , however , that such a damping term produces a nonanalytic dependency in @xmath50 on matsubara frequencies .",
    "this rules out a straightforward application of the usual gradient expansion .",
    "such an expansion would correspond to a taylor expansion of @xmath99 in powers of @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath99 has to be even in @xmath100 its linear term would vanish and the leading term would be of second order in @xmath100 in disagreement with the exact result eq.(26 ) . to overcome this problem we will use in the following a modified version of a gradient expansion which is able to give the leading non - local corrections to the local term also in our case .    in leading order in @xmath74 or , equivalently",
    ", in the local approximation , we assumed that the electrons in the general n - th order term @xmath101 given in eq.(19 ) interact elastically with the phonons .",
    "the first correction to that obviously is obtained by considering in this diagram 2 vertices where the electrons are inelastically and n-2 vertices where the electrons are elastically scattered .",
    "the case of one vertex with inelastic scattering is not possible due to the conservation of matsubara frequencies .",
    "the analytic expression for @xmath101 is , taking the above processes into account , @xmath102 @xmath14 and @xmath103 are the two vertices where inelastic scattering occurs .",
    "a factor @xmath104 has also been introduced in order not to overcount the contributions . however ,",
    "this factor is compensated by the spin factor 2 .",

    "the only assumption is that the instanton gas is dilute , i.e. , that self - energy effects for the tunnel modes can be neglected .",
    "let us first disregard the nonlocal part @xmath130 in the atomic potential .",
    "the hamiltonian for the impurity atom is then hermitean and can be diagonalized yielding two low - lying states which are split by tunnelling processes . disregarding small oscillations around the extremal paths the evaluation of the path integral by instanton solutions corresponds to the solution of the schroedinger equation for the two lowest - lying states of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus the instanton part of the electron green s function , @xmath203 , can also be obtained from an effective two - level model with the hamiltonian @xmath204 @xmath205 and @xmath206 are hubbard operators defined as the projection operators @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively , where @xmath209 are the two lowest states of the atomic hamiltonian and @xmath185 their splitting .",

    "taking also @xmath130 into account changes the extremal instanton configurations .",
    "however , in the dilute instanton approximation , only the action along the extremal path enters .",

    "using a similar consideration @xmath295 should approach the curve @xmath296 , which is in agreement with fig .",

    "our calculations imply that the validity of the migdal - eliashberg perturbation expansion is not solely governed by the condition @xmath320 , as often is assumed , but also by @xmath321 , where @xmath304 lies around 1.2 for a small migdal parameter @xmath322 . based on the lang - firsov transformation",
    "the condition @xmath321 for the validity of the migdal - eliashberg expansion has also been stressed in ref.@xcite .      in this section",
    "we present numerical results for the electronic properties of the holstein model . in the last section",
    "we have seen that the crossing from the weak to the strong - coupling regime is characterized by a drastic change in the effective atomic potential due to the appearance of anharmonic effects and the formation of a double well .",
    "these effects also cause typical features in the spectral properties of electrons .",

    "for @xmath330 the system is still in the metallic state , however , @xmath95 is much smaller than the canonical value @xmath325 .",

    "become larger and larger and the electronic state at a site consists of a coherent superposition of a doubly and an unoccupied state . at @xmath336 the coherency",
    "is practically lost leading to an incoherent arrangement of doubly and unoccupied sites .",
    "11 shows the negative imaginary part of @xmath34 .",
    "for small @xmath0 s this function resembles the density of bare states . with increasing @xmath0 it develops a strong central component which looks like a needle for @xmath337 . at the same time",
    "spectral weight is shifted to the upper and lower ends of the spectrum which gradually transforms into an upper and lower subband .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 these subbands move away from the center and lose spectral weight .",

    "for the values of @xmath0 on the left panel of this figure @xmath339 is essentially proportional to the density of bare states except at small frequencies where it drops to small values reflecting the fermi liquid ground state .",
    "the region of small values decreases with increasing @xmath0 due to the softening of the phonon and the appearance of the tunnel mode . for the larger values for @xmath0 used in the right panel the spectral weight accumulates in a central component and two sidebands which move away from the center .",
    "the low - frequency behavior of the real part of the self - energy can be characterized by an effective mass @xmath340 defined by @xmath341 figure 13 shows @xmath342 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath283 . at small @xmath0 the mass enhancement",
    "is given by @xmath343 .",
    "above @xmath344 @xmath340 increases much stronger than linearly which announces localization and the transition to the insulating state .",

    "14 for four different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the large drude peak seen for @xmath349 splits for @xmath350 into a small peak at @xmath327 and a broader peak at a finite value of @xmath250 . beyond @xmath351 the drude peak has virtually vanished and all spectral weight has been accumulated in the broad peak caused by transitions between the two subbands .",
    "15 shows the frequency dependence of the spectral function @xmath352 of the lattice green s function at the fermi surface @xmath353 . the thick solid line corresponding to @xmath350 exhibits the quasiparticle peak at @xmath354 and a rather well developed two - peak structure of the incoherent background .",
    "the thin solid line represents the same spectral function calculated within the migdal - eliashberg perturbation expansion where the phonon field is expanded around @xmath355 .",
    "the same parameter has been used as well as the exact eigenstates in the potential @xmath131 .",
    "the quasi - particle peak is in this case more pronounced and the incoherent background is structureless .",
    "our path integral approach shows that the point @xmath356 is an unstable extremal point in this case and that the two potential minima are stable extremal points suitable for expansions .",
    "this clearly means that the thin line in fig .",
    "15 is incorrect and that the migdal- eliashberg expansion has broken down in spite of the small migdal parameter @xmath357 used in this figure . for @xmath358 both the thick and thin dashed - dotted curves exhibit no longer visible quasiparticle peaks at @xmath327 .",
    "the migdal - eliashberg expansion , however , is unable to reproduce the two - peak structure of the incoherent background but instead shows a broad and structureless peak .",
    "though a double well potential has been formed already for @xmath359 the two approaches give similar results in this case , mainly because the first excited state is above the barrier and the trajectories of the atom are rather delocalized .",
    "this means that for a migdal parameter of 0.1 the migdal - eliashberg expansion breaks down for @xmath360 .      to complete the overview of the electronic properties we show here also results obtained in the limit @xmath361",
    "this limit is equivalent to the limit @xmath362 and corresponds to the case where the phonons behave like a quasi - static , classical field .",
    "@xmath37 can then be calculated from eq.(38 ) and an explicit high - temperature expansion of eq.(45 ) and ( 46 ) shows that the corrections are of the order @xmath363 . on the other hand ,",
    "the validity of our general quantum - mechanical approach requires @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "the first inequality follows from eqs.(51 ) and ( 52 ) , the second one by expanding eqs.(45 ) and ( 46 ) at high temperatures after taking the limit @xmath362 .",

    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "16 and 17 . for @xmath284 the above expansion parameters are small and the two corresponding curves indeed are practically coincident",
    "this agrees with the observation that in the quantum - mechanical approach @xmath368 is already so large that the quasi - particle peak in the spectral function of the lattice green s function has completely vanished . for @xmath369 similar double well potentials form in the two cases . in the quantum - mechanical treatment",
    "the instanton contribution can safely be neglected at these high temperatures and thermally activated processes seem somewhat impeded by the level quantization compared to the classical case . as a result",
    "the splitting of the band into two subbands occurs more slowly in the classical , quasi - static case than in the quantum - mechanical case . for @xmath370 @xmath324",
    "shows in both cases well - splitted bands with a pseudo - gap in between where the density is finite but exponentially small . in fig .",
    "16 the shape of the two peaks resembles the bare density of the bethe lattice whereas in fig .",

    "the two figures illustrate that the quantum - mechanical treatment approaches smoothly the classical case with infinite heavy atoms at high temperatures and agrees with the latter also quantitatively if all expansion parameters are small .",
    "we have studied the holstein model in infinite dimensions at half - filling in the normal state .",
    "in contrast to recent semiclassical treatments we consider the atomic displacements as a quantized , dynamical field which enables us to recover fermi liquid properties at low temperatures in the metallic state . our approximation scheme is based on expansions of path integrals around extremal paths of the action .",
    "this method allows to treat arbitrary strengths of the coupling constant @xmath0 on the same footing . for each stationary path a migdal - eliashberg - like expansion is generated which converges well both for weak and strong couplings . beyond a critical value of @xmath0",
    "there is also a time - dependent , extremal instanton path associated with the tunneling of atoms between equivalent minima in the effective atomic potential . assuming that the instantons are dilute a perturbation expansion of the electronic self - energy in terms of unrenormalized instanton propagators has been carried out and shown that for most purposes only the lowest - order , bare term has to be included .",
    "we found that the usual migdal - eliashberg perturbation expansion breaks down around @xmath371 .",
    "this breakdown is caused by the appearance of more than one extremal path of the action .",
    "related to this is that the original expansion point at @xmath372 for the phonon field @xmath373 corresponds no longer to a minimum but to a local maximum of the effective potential .",
    "the following picture emerges from the calculations : for @xmath374 the system is in a metallic state which can be described by migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "phonon renormalizations are then weak and the electronic mass enhancement is linear in @xmath0 . for @xmath375 the adiabatic approximation breaks down .",
    "the system stays mainly in ionic states with either two or zero electrons .",
    "each state has its own displacement pattern and instantaneous equilibrium position .",
    "the system is still metallic due to atomic tunneling processes between the potential minima , however , the electronic spectral functions develop a two - peak structure which can not be obtained in the migdal - eliashberg theory . increasing @xmath0 further the electronic band splits into two subbands , the system becomes effectively insulating and behaves like a mixture of unoccupied and doubly occupied states .",
    "the semiclassical treatment and also the exact solution for vanishing hopping show that this `` insulating '' state is for any finite temperature not truly insulating : the density of electronic states between the two subbands is exponentially small but not exactly zero ."
