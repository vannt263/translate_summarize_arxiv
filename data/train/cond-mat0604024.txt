    "in our investigation concerning transcription networks , we came across a simple and effective way to generate a random ensemble of directed graphs having similar features as the experimental ones .",
    "transcription networks are directed graphs that represent regulatory interactions between genes .",
    "specifically , the link @xmath1 exists if the protein coded by gene @xmath2 affects the transcription of gene @xmath3 in mrna form by binding along dna in a site upstream of its coding region  @xcite . for a few organisms , such as e.  coli and s.  cerevisiae , a significant fraction of the wiring diagram of this network",
    "is known  @xcite .",
    "the hope is to study these graphs , together with the available information on the genes and the physics / chemistry of their interactions , to infer information on the large - scale architecture and evolution of gene regulation in living systems . in this program ,",
    "the simplest approach to take is to study the topology of the interaction networks .",
    "for instance , order parameters such as the connectivity and the clustering coefficient have been considered  @xcite .    to assess a topological feature of a network , one typically generates so called `` randomized counterparts '' of the original data set as a null model .",
    "that is , an ensemble of random networks which bare some resemblance to the original .",
    "the idea behind it is to establish when and to what extent the observed biological topology , and thus loosely the living system under exam , deviates from the `` typical case '' statistics of the null ensemble .",
    "for example , a topological feature that has lead to relevant biological findings , in particular for transcription , is the occurrence of small subgraphs - or `` network motifs ''  @xcite .",
    "the choice of what feature to conserve ( or not ) in the randomized counterpart is quite delicate and depends on specific considerations on the system  @xcite .",
    "the null ensemble used to discover motifs usually conserves the degree sequences of the original network , that is , the number of regulators and targets of each node .",
    "the observed degree sequences for the known transcription networks follow a scale - free distribution for the outdegree , with exponent between one and two , while being poissonian in the indegree  @xcite .",
    "motifs are then interpreted as elementary circuit - like building blocks and have been shown in many cases to work independently  @xcite .    .",
    "nodes with more than ten outgoing edges are larger ( red online ) . ]    in connection with this line of research , it is interesting to study random ensembles of graphs with probability distributions for the degree sequences that are similar to those observed experimentally , with the objective of characterizing theoretically some relevant topological observables , such as the subgraph distributions  @xcite . here , we describe a simple , and fast , algorithm that performs this task by tossing coins with prescribed random biases . differently from more sophisticated techniques available in the literature",
    "@xcite , our method is not designed to conserve a degree sequence , but rather as a general random graph model , that , in particular , can be used to generate graphs with degree distributions that agree with the observed power - law distributed outdegrees and compact indegrees  @xcite . to this aim , the ensemble will be generated by a parametric model , where the adjustable parameters can be used for fits of real data - sets .",
    "note that , with the weaker constraint on the degree distribution that we have chosen , it would be very inconvenient to generate the ensemble throwing degree sequences _ a priori _ from the given distributions and then using an algorithm designed for fixed degree sequences , which is necessarily more costly .",
    "we will see that , because of the extreme simplicity of our formulation , some observables can be computed analytically rather than estimated as in ref .",
    "after introducing the algorithm and showing that the ensemble has the required features , we will compute the number of some observables that are relevant for transcription , such as triangular subgraphs .",
    "any directed graph @xmath4 with @xmath5 nodes is completely described by its adjacency matrix @xmath6_{i , j=1,\\dots , n } $ ] , where @xmath7 if there is a directed edge @xmath8 , @xmath9 otherwise . instead of square matrices ,",
    "one may also consider rectangular matrices with a prescription on the scaling of the rows with the columns . in",
    "what follows we will deal with rectangular matrices @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "as we will see , this is particularly useful for networks with power - law degree distributions having exponent equal or lower than two ( for which the average diverges ) , to keep the asymptotics well - behaved . in the context of transcription networks , the hypothesis of rectangularity",
    "is well - motivated by the fact that typically only a subset of @xmath12 nodes encode for transcription factors ( namely , they have outgoing edges ) .",
    "thus , in a @xmath13 matrix , the first @xmath12 columns will contain the incoming links to the transcription factors , and the next @xmath14 columns will correspond to non transcription - factor encoding genes .",
    "note that in general nodes that send out edges are also receiving edges ( fig  [ fig : delta ] ) .    .",
    "]    our model ensemble can be defined by the following generative algorithm . for each row of @xmath15 ,",
    "( i ) throw a bias @xmath16 from a prescribed probability distribution @xmath17 ( ii ) set the row elements of @xmath15 to be @xmath9 or @xmath18 according to the toss of a coin with bias @xmath16 . since each row is thrown independently , the resulting probability law is @xmath19 } \\th_i^{\\sum_{j=1}^n        e_{i , j}}(1-\\th_i)^{n-\\sum_{j=1}^n e_{i , j } } \\pi_n(d\\th_i )       \\end{array }    \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "note that the row elements are not independent  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) is a general probability distribution based on two symmetries : ( a ) the fact that a node regulates other ones is independent from the nodes regulated by other genes ( b ) the identity of the regulated nodes is unimportant , and what matters is their number only .",
    "the two symmetries can be summarized by saying that the indegree and the outdegree are uncorrelated  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that our model could also be seen as a special case of a directed graph variant of the so called hidden variables models , introduced in  @xcite , see also  @xcite . in this very general class of undirected random graphs",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is interpreted as the `` fitness '' of each vertex and the emphasis is on the problem of how power - laws may emerge `` naturally '' in interaction networks . to complete our model , one has to specify the choice for @xmath17 , which determines the behavior of the graph ensemble .",
    "we choose the two - parameter distribution @xmath24}(\\th ) d\\th\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are free parameters , @xmath27}$ ] is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath28 $ ] , taking the value one inside the interval and zero everywhere else , and @xmath29 is the normalization constant . in simple words ,",
    ".   defines the probability to take a coin with a certain bias @xmath16 , which is connected to the outdegree of the corresponding node .",
    "as we will see , the function @xmath30 gives a power - law tail to the outdegree .",
    "conversely , the cutoff on @xmath23 defined by @xmath31 poses a constraint on the number of low outdegree nodes , and will be used to control the indegree distribution . in concrete applications at finite sizes , it might be useful to introduce also an upper cutoff on @xmath17 , that is @xmath32}(\\th ) d\\th.\\ ] ] this does not affect the asymptotic results given below but gives more flexibility to the model .",
    "hence , in what follows , with the exception of section [ sec : fit ] , we shall take @xmath33 .",
    "an example of a graph generated with our algorithm is shown in fig  [ fig : grafofig ] .",
    "the algorithm is quite efficient : its computational cost is determined by the number of coin tosses ( each of which takes the same amount of operations ) and thus scales like @xmath34 .",
    "our fortran 77 implementation running under linux on an amd athlon 64 x2 3800 + pc , generates a graph with @xmath35 in about @xmath36 seconds .",
    "many observables can be computed knowing the probability of the link @xmath37 , @xmath38 } \\th \\pi_n(d \\th)$ ] . by simple calculation from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) and  , we get @xmath39 note that the formulas above for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are identical , but have been recast to show the leading terms in the scaling .",
    "hence @xmath42 , for @xmath43 , scales as @xmath44 if @xmath45 , as @xmath46 if @xmath47 , and as @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is directly related to the mean number of links in the network , which can thus be controlled through the parametric dependency of this quantity .",
    "we did not prove anything regarding the emergence of a giant component .",
    "the graphs we generated numerically seem to have a large component . on the other hand , analytically , it is not hard to see that probability that a graph @xmath4 generated with our technique has only one connected component goes to zero as @xmath5 diverges .",
    "the variable @xmath50 represents the indegree of the @xmath51-th node in the random graph , while @xmath52 represents the outdegree of the @xmath53-th node ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "clearly , the mean degrees are equal to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . to access the degree distributions",
    ", one has to compute @xmath57 } \\th^k(1-\\th)^{n - k } \\pi_n(d \\th ) $ ] and @xmath58 .    ,",
    "square adjacency matrices and different values of the parameters .",
    "top : @xmath59 .",
    "bottom : @xmath60 . to obtain a compact indegree distribution in the case of @xmath61 one has to supply smaller values of @xmath31 .",
    "the dashed lines are power - laws with exponent @xmath62 . ]",
    "let us concentrate first on the outdegree .",
    "an evaluation of its distribution yields the following asymptotic law for @xmath63 for any @xmath25 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 it is easy to show that @xmath66 has a power - law tail .",
    "indeed , if @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 indicates the gamma function ) . thus , since @xmath70 , one concludes that @xmath71 fig.[fig : degree ] shows the degree distributions of numerically generated examples for @xmath72 . in practice , already at @xmath0 one gets a very marked power - law in the tail of the outdegree distribution .",
    "considering now the indegree , since its behavior is determined by @xmath42 , one has to distinguish among the different possible scalings for this quantity .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath73 , where for @xmath74\\delta n[$ ] ( @xmath75 being any constant in @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77x[$ ] being the integer part of @xmath78 ) and for @xmath79 , using the poissonian approximation of a binomial distribution , it is immediate to show that @xmath80 , with @xmath81 things are slightly more complicated for @xmath82 . here , essentially because of the scaling for @xmath42 in the limit @xmath63 , the indegree distribution diverges if one chooses @xmath74\\delta n[$ ] .",
    "thus , to obtain a well - behaved asymptotic distribution , one has to compensate more strongly for the scaling of @xmath42 with the number of rows of @xmath15 . for @xmath83 ,",
    "the necessary choice is @xmath84\\delta n/\\log n[$ ] rows , and for @xmath85 one has to take @xmath74\\delta n^{\\b-1}[$ ] rows . with these prescriptions ,",
    "the indegree distribution is asymptotically poisson , and has the form @xmath86 with @xmath87 , or @xmath88 , for @xmath83 and @xmath85 respectively . in other words , asking for a degree distribution that brings to an outdegree having a power - law tail with divergent mean ( @xmath61 ) poses a heavy constraint on the number of regulator nodes ( the rows of the matrix ) . on the other hand , for the purpose of generating square ( @xmath89 ) matrices at finite @xmath5 with @xmath82 and compact indegree",
    ", this issue is not so important . a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ fig : degree ] )",
    "can solve the problem . in what follows",
    "we will discuss mainly the case of square matrices .",
    "the simple structure of the random graphs generated by our algorithm makes it possible to compute analytically the mean value of the number of subgraphs of a given shape contained in the graph .",
    "consider a subgraph @xmath90 , with @xmath91 nodes and @xmath92 edges , that is , the set of ordered pairs of nodes @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",
    "for example , @xmath95 denotes a `` feedback loop '' ( ` fbl ` ) , or a 3-cycle .",
    "now , if @xmath4 is a random graph with @xmath5 nodes generated by our algorithm , the probability to observe @xmath90 as a subgraph of @xmath4 can be written as @xmath96 } \\th_1^{m_1 } \\pi(d\\th_1 )   \\dots   \\int_{[0,1 ] } \\th_k^{m_k } \\pi_n(d \\th_k ) .\\ ] ] to compute the mean of the number @xmath97 of subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath90 one also has to consider the quantity @xmath98 of subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath90 contained in the complete graph with @xmath5 nodes .",
    "the desired average is then @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 denotes the mean ) .",
    "things are slightly more complicated for rectangular matrices because in the evaluation of @xmath98 one needs to take into consideration also the constrains given by the fact that only @xmath12 nodes can have out edges .    , for @xmath101 .",
    "numerical averages are evaluated on @xmath102 realizations .",
    "top and middle : mean number of three - node subgraphs .",
    "each subgraph is sketched next to its corresponding plot .",
    "top : feedforward and feedback loops ( ` ffl ` and ` fbl ` ) .",
    "middle : two kinds of open triangles , that can be termed `` single input modules '' ( ` sim ` ) and `` three - gene chains '' ( ` tgc ` ) .",
    "bottom : roots and leaves . ]    as an example , we evaluate now , in the case of square matrices , the mean number of feedback loops versus feedforward loops , which play an important role for transcription  @xcite . a feedforward loop ( ` ffl",
    "` ) is a triangle with the form @xmath103 .",
    "it is found to be a motif in known transcription networks , and identified with the function of persistence filter or amplifier .",
    "conversely , feedback loops ( which in principle could form switches and oscillators ) are usually not found in transcription networks  @xcite . following the procedure described above",
    ", one gets @xmath104 ( this holds also for @xmath91-cycles , with @xmath91 in place of 3 ) .",
    "once more , this can be evaluated analytically with straightforward calculations .",
    "as it depends only on the behavior of @xmath42 , its scaling for large @xmath5 easily follows .",

    "[ sec : fflav ] , we spelled out the example of ` ffl`s to exemplify this point .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : motifs ] , we report a comparison of the exact calculation of some triangular subgraphs with results obtained from numerical evaluation .",
    "the agreement between the analytical expressions and the numerics is perfect .",
    "having analytically exact expressions for any system size can be an advantage with respect to models where only asymptotically exact expressions are available , especially thinking that many concrete datasets have relatively small sizes .",
    "moreover , it is possible to compute analytically the standard deviation of the number of subgraphs .",
    "for example , we considered again the number of feedback loops and feedforward loops .",
    "the most interesting fact is that for @xmath107 , the former are always more widely distributed .",
    "a sketch of the calculation and some results are reported in appendix [ sec : a1 ] .",
    "finally , one can evaluate the scaling behavior of the ratio of feedback and feedforward loops , which is given below @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the ` ffl ` always dominate , although there is a wide range of regimes .",
    "note that the dominance of feedforward triangles is even stronger if one considers the rectangular adjacency matrices discussed above .",
    "for example , for @xmath110 , and rectangular matrices , we calculate @xmath111 .      as a second example",
    ", we report the calculation of the mean number of roots ( nodes with only outgoing links ) versus leaves ( nodes with only incoming links ) .",
    "more specifically , we say that @xmath53 is a root if there is no edge of the kind @xmath112 , but there is at least one edge of the kind @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .",
    "loops do not count .",
    "conversely , we say that @xmath53 is a leaf if there is no edge of the kind @xmath113 , but there is at least one edge of the kind @xmath112 , with @xmath114 .",
    "again we exclude loops and isolated points .",
    "we find the following scaling for the numbers of roots @xmath115 , and of leaves  @xmath116 : @xmath117 while @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "once again , we stress that these quantities are accessible analytically , and there is perfect agreement between the data generated by the algorithm and the calculations .      as a last example of important observable in our graph ensemble , we discuss the distribution and mean number of hubs .",
    "the so  called hub is the node having maximal outdegree among the nodes , that is , @xmath120 . once again",
    ", it is possible to give an analytical expression of the limit law of the hub under a suitable rescaling .",
    "indeed , by stochastic independence , it is clear that @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is any positive number .",
    "moreover , it is not too hard to prove that , for suitable choices of @xmath123 and @xmath12 , @xmath124 $ ] .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath125 and for every positive number @xmath78 @xmath126 the above expression gives the effective probability distribution that one can use for the hub outdegree in the asymptotic limit . in particular , for @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and , with some work , we prove that @xmath130 , as found in  @xcite . for @xmath131 ,",
    "one has to take @xmath132 , which lead to analogous scaling results .",
    "finally , for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , one gets the expression @xmath135 for every positive @xmath78 .",
    "note that in this last case the probability of finding a hub of size @xmath5 is asymptotically finite , and equal to @xmath136 .",
    "this concentration effect was already noted in  @xcite using a different random graph model , without computing explicitly the asymptotic probability distribution .",
    "it is worth recalling that @xmath137 is the frechet type ii extreme value distribution , i.e. one of the three kinds of extreme value distributions that can arise from limit law of maximum of independent and identically distributed random variables ( see for instance @xcite ) . for extreme values distributions in scale - free network models",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "while here we restricted our attention to the case of directed graphs with compact indegree and power - law outdegree , our coin - toss method of generating exchangeable graphs is more general and has a wider range of application .",
    "for example , one can consider the following algorithm : ( i ) throw a bias @xmath16 from a prescribed probability distribution @xmath17 ( ii ) set all the elements of @xmath15 to be @xmath9 or @xmath18 according to the toss of a coin with bias @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting probability law , for square matrices , is @xmath138 } \\th^{\\sum_{i , j } e_{i , j}}(1-\\th)^{n^2-\\sum_{i , j } e_{i , j } } \\pi_n(d\\th ) \\\\",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath139 being any element in @xmath140 @xmath141 . again set @xmath142 } \\th \\pi_n(d \\th)$ ] .",
    "the resulting ensemble of random graph has a large variability in the number of links . in the @xmath143 case ,",
    "the degree distributions are given by @xmath144 } \\th^k(1-\\th)^{n - k } \\pi_n(d\\th ) .",
    "$ ] assuming ( [ defpi ] ) one gets @xmath145 which has , again , a power - law tail .",
    "for this model , quantities like the mean number of subgraphs , roots , leaves and hubs , are again easily computed analytically , in the same way we described above .",
    "furthermore , throwing a triangular matrix with the same algorithm , one can easily generate a power - law model for undirected graphs .",
    "finally , variants of the model can be generated by changing the probability distribution @xmath17 for the biases .",
    "overall , all these possibilities remain open to explore and could be useful to generate both analytically solvable random graph models and quicker algorithms in many applications .",
    "a detailed comparison between known real transcriptional networks and the null models obtained with our coin - toss algorithm is beyond our aims here . nevertheless , to show that our model can be used for direct statistical comparisons , as an alternative to the more stringent constraint of preserved degree sequences , we present here a brief application to the shen - orr  @xcite dataset for the e.  coli transcription network .",
    "motifs discovery , for example , entails comparing the occurrence of subgraphs in a real network with a null ensemble .",
    "this null ensemble can be obtained from our coin - toss model , with some prescribed parameter set .",
    "the parameters can be chosen by performing a fit of the model graphs with some observed features of the data , such as , for example , decay of the degree distributions and number of regulatory elements ( additional parameters can also be introduced if needed ) .",
    "the chosen `` invariants '' can be motivated biologically .",
    "we generated our random ensemble with distribution @xmath17 given by ( [ defpi2 ] ) as follows .",
    "first , from a frequentistic estimate of @xmath17 we determined the probable value of @xmath62 and of the cutoff on the maximum , i.e. @xmath146 .",
    "this last quantity has to be regarded as a biological constraint , and is necessary to obtain an ensemble having on average the same number of links as the empirical one ; we measure the upper cutoff @xmath147 to be about @xmath148 . the estimated value for @xmath62 ranges from 1.6 to 2.1 , depending on the binning of the histogram of @xmath149 .",
    "we note that these values are larger than those that obtained from fitting direcly on the outdegree sequence . as a second step",
    ", we fixed the rectangularity of the matrix with the ratio of transcription factors to total number of nodes , choosing @xmath75 such that @xmath150 .",
    "finally , we fitted @xmath31 to reproduce on average the observed number of links and nodes . in practice , since the model nturally produces a certain number of isolated nodes , one has to generate slightly larger matrices and compare the submatrix made of non - isolated nodes .",
    "the ensemble obtained with this procedure fits quite well the empirical in- and out - degree sequences ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit]a ) , also , the model reproduces the empirical number of transcription factors , roots and leaves as average values . as a remark",
    ", we note that , unless new prescriptions for the generation of the graphs , and thus new parameters , are introduced , roots , leaves and transcripiton factors can not be reproduced well with smaller values of @xmath62 than the ones we used .",
    "one can take this as a confirmation that the range of values for the exponent obtained with our fitting procedure are reasonable .",
    "we also measured the three - node subgraph content of the null model and compared it with the empirical data and the model ensemble are very close ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit]b ) .",
    "the only exception is the ` ffl ` , with a slight deviation , that , however , is much less significant than with the degree - conserving ensemble .",
    "thus , in term of these observables , one obtains similar graphs as the empirical one .",
    "this means that in the resulting ensemble the average motif content can be regarded as an invariant , rather than as an observable .",
    "finally , we quantified the feedback properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit]c ) . in order to do this , we measured the number @xmath151 of nodes left in the graph after pruning its input and output tree - like components with an iterative decimation algorithm  @xcite .",
    "in particular , none of the graphs we generated was treelike and feedforward as the empirical one .",
    "one may then speculate that the motif content and the hierarchical properties , two important properties are somehow related .",
    "we presented an algorithmic way to generate directed graphs with , asymptotically , power - law outdegree and compact indegree , easily generalizable to different kinds of graphs .",
    "the discussion was carried out having in mind an application in the realm of transcription networks , although there are many possible connections with other experimentally accessible complex networks , including biological ones .",
    "compared to other techniques , our model has the advantage to be quick in generating large graphs , as it is not designed to preserve a prescribed degree sequence , but rather to generate an ensemble with given degree distributions .",
    "as such , it is an interesting tool to characterize topological observables in large graphs .",
    "most importantly , many of the relevant observables are accessible analytically , for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "we supplied here as an example the evaluation of the mean number of subgraphs , roots and leaves and hub .",
    "we should add here a comment regarding the is not evident that the proposed approach is more efficient that the molloy - reed algorithm  @xcite , which generates `` stubs '' with desired in- and outdegree sequences , and matches the stubs to generate the graphs .",
    "this model could be re - cast to be similar in spirit , in the sense that one could fix the relevant distributions depending on parameters , ad throw the degree sequences from the distributions .",
    "once the number of connections for each node has been drawn from the expected degree distribution and without avoiding multiple connections , the computational cost of pairing the stubs is order e ( number of edges ) , so in sparse networks this could be less than order @xmath152 , and in non - sparse networks it could be @xmath152 . despite the algorithm suffers from the undesired production of multiple edges , due to the computational complexity of pairing hubs , for a compact indegree distribution , this computational cost can be small  @xcite , allowing a practical applicability in some regimes . on the other hand",
    ", we think that our approach remains competitive , as its computational cost is not affected by the complexity of the graph ensemble , and , as we have shown , is very versatile for analytical calculations .",
    "regarding the subgraph structure , we note that while ` ffl`s always dominate on ` fbl`s , there are qualitatively different behaviors depending on the exponent @xmath62 .",
    "the most marked dominance is found for smaller values of @xmath62 , and is further increased by considering rectangular matrices ( i.e. asymptotically compact indegree ) .",
    "thus , the degree distribution poses some important constraints on the dominant subgraphs in our null model .",
    "we would like to spend a few more words on these scaling laws with system size @xmath5 . in our model the scaling of @xmath42 with the decay exponent @xmath62 pilots the transitions of all the observables .",
    "in particular , it renders necessary to consider rectangular matrices to obtain an asymptotically compact indegree if @xmath61 .",
    "this behavior is interesting on theoretical grounds , and shows how much the distributions for the in- and outdegree in transcription networks are strongly unbalanced .",
    "for example , in the model described in section  [ sec : var ] , where the indegree is allowed to have a power - law tail , the situation is rather different . in the case of transcription networks , there is an observed scaling law of the fraction of transcription factors ( nodes that have at least one outgoing link ) .",
    "this is a power - law @xmath153  @xcite with positive exponent @xmath154 .",
    "looking at the distribution of roots , one easily realizes that this behavior forbids any asymptotic limit assuming the graph structure of our model , and is thus incompatible with it . at the light of our calculations",
    ", we can observe that it is likely that for larger values of @xmath5 the outdegree ceases to follow a power - law , and/or the average indegree ceases to be finite , the opposite trend to that observed in small networks .",
    "experimental observations of larger transcription networks will elucidate this question .",
    "we should stress here that the above considerations apply mainly to the model .",
    "nevertheless , we showed that in principle our model can be used for direct statistical comparisons , as an alternative to the more stringent constraint of preserved degree sequences .",
    "an example of such a fitting procedure , produced an ensemble of networks that resemble the empirical one of e.  coli in terms of degree distribution , number of links , roots , leaves and transcrption factors .",
    "interestingly , the null ensemble produced this way also has a very similar three - node subgraph content as the empirical graph .",
    "on the other hand , the feedback properties are very different .",
    "the outcome of such a comparison might depend on the invariance criteria used for the fitting .",
    "this is an interesting feature that can be used to produce flexible null models , depending on the quantities of interest . on the other hand",
    ", this feature makes the handling of the model more delicate than the standard degree - conserving randomizations .",
