    "below we tend to use the notations from hietarinta s paper  @xcite .",
    "recall that hietarinta proposed in that paper solutions to yang ",
    "baxter , tetrahedron , and higher simplex equations , acting as permutations on ( tensor products of ) basis vectors .",
    "for instance , the following simple permutation yields a solution to the constant yang  baxter equation ( cybe ) : @xmath2 ( compare  ( * ? ? ? * formula  ( 9 ) ) ) .",
    "[ cnv:2c ] in this paper , we consider only _ two - color _ solutions , the colors being denoted as @xmath3 and  @xmath4 .",
    "so , our indices @xmath5 take only these two values .",
    "[ cnv : am ] the addition of indices mentioned in convention  [ cnv:2c ] is understood modulo  @xmath6 .",
    "there is one more interesting operator , although it does not make by itself a solution to cybe : @xmath7 consider , however , the following _ linear combination _ : @xmath8 and the following _ non - constant _ yang ",
    "baxter relation : @xmath9 one can readily see that holds provided @xmath10    our operator   is a particular case of both baxter  @xcite and felderhof  @xcite eight - vertex @xmath0-operators .",
    "figure  [ f:8 ]    , thick lines  to color  @xmath4 ]    depicts its matrix elements .",
    "a reader with experience in various kinds of eight - vertex models will notice that our @xmath0-operator   can be represented , by taking different bases in our two - dimensional `` color '' spaces , by just a `` four - vertex '' @xmath0-matrix .",
    "nevertheless , some simple further analysis shows that the corresponding lattice statistical model displays not completely trivial behavior , with a phase transition at @xmath12 .",
    "also , imagine that we knew only the model with boltzmann weights as in figure  [ f:8 ] , satisfying equation    then this could be already a good stimulus for ( re)discovering baxter s and felderhof s models , by substituting different weights instead of ones and lambdas .    and finally , @xmath0-operator   will soon be generalized to much less trivial case of three dimensions , compare with the formula in case  [ case:3 ] in section  [ s : lcp ] .",
    "sometimes we will encounter _ non - invertible _",
    "@xmath0-operators satisfying yang  baxter or tetrahedron equation .",
    "a simple example is operator   with @xmath14 .",
    "we would like to remark here that such operators can still be relevant for constructing commuting transfer matrices .",
    "to explain the idea , it is enough to take the yang ",
    "baxter case .",
    "so , let the relation @xmath15 with no requirements of invertibility for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and  @xmath18 .",
    "then , the two commuting transfer matrices @xmath19 and  @xmath20 are most easily presented pictorially , see figure  [ f : d ] .        similar construction of commuting transfer matrices in the case of one more dimension , and tetrahedron equation instead of yang",
    " baxter , can be found in paper  @xcite : the analogue of the upper transfer matrix in figure  [ f : d ] consists of `` hedgehogs '' , while the other transfer matrix forms a _",
    "kagome _ lattice , with three different types of vertices .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for details .",
    "recall that hietarinta s permutation - type @xmath0-operators were defined , for an @xmath21-simplex equation , using an @xmath22-matrix  @xmath23 and @xmath21-column  @xmath24 , usually written together as @xmath25 $ ] , and acting _ linearly on indices _ in the following way  ( * ? ? ? *",

    ". partial trace of   in the fourth pair of indices gives the sum @xmath31 of two permutation - type operators , corresponding to the following two respective matrices @xmath25 $ ] : @xmath32_{\\mathcal s } =    \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c }    1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0   \\end{array}\\right ] ,   \\qquad [ a|b]_{\\mathcal t } =    \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c }    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1   \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] note that operator  @xmath33 satisfies by itself the tetrahedron equation ( and can be obtained by central reflection from the second solution in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection  5.4 ) ) .",
    "operator   is highly degenerate : of rank  @xmath34 , while acting in an eight - dimensional space .",
    "it can still be already interesting , as explained in our subsection  [ ss : non - inv ] .",
    "remarkably , it can also be generalized , according to formula   below , while still obeying the ( now non - constant ) tetrahedron equation .",
    "we consider the following non - constant tetrahedron equation : @xmath35 where all @xmath36 are defined according to the following ansatz : @xmath37 and @xmath38 and  @xmath39 are operators @xmath33 and  @xmath40 , defined according to   and acting in the tensor product of spaces numbered @xmath41 , @xmath42 and  @xmath43 .",
    "matrix elements of operator   are depicted in figure  [ f : s+at ] .    , @xmath42 and  @xmath43 left out .",
    "thin lines correspond to color  @xmath3 , thick lines  to color  @xmath4 ]    operator   can thus be said to correspond to a three - dimensional _ sixteen - vertex _ model .",
    "equation   imposes some restrictions on the four parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and  @xmath47 .",
    "namely , a calculation using singular computer algebra system shows that holds provided they belong to the algebraic variety containing five irreducible components written out below as `` cases [ case:1][case:5 ] '' .",
    "[ case:1 ] @xmath48    [ case:2 ] @xmath49    [ case:3 ] @xmath50    [ case:4 ] @xmath51    [ case:5 ] @xmath52",
    "this short note shows that there exists some interesting algebra related to the 16-vertex model in figure  [ f : s+at ] .",
    "it is not yet known how nontrivial this model is or / and what interesting generalizations it admits .",
    "one feature stimulating further research in this direction is that boltzmann weights in figure  [ f : s+at ] are clearly positive when @xmath53 .",
    "note that all @xmath0-operators are ( generically ) non - degenerate in our case  [ case:5 ] .",
    "other cases are also of interest , for instance , the relation between parameters in case  [ case:3 ] , if written in the additive form @xmath54 resembles the usual yang ",
    "baxter models very much  although more effort could be required to cope with the degeneracy of  @xmath55 ."
