    "during the last decades the study of neutron stars has offered the possibility to investigate various topics of modern physics . due to their very large central density ( several times larger than normal saturation density )",
    "neutron stars represent a natural observatory to study the behavior of the matter under extreme conditions . in this line ,",
    "the issue whether neutron stars may host a deconfined quark phase in their cores is still an open question .",
    "quark matter nucleation in neutron stars has been studied by many authors both in cold @xcite and finite temperature @xcite hadronic matter , or even in the presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these studies suggested that the nucleation process may play an important role in the emission of gamma ray bursts and supernovae explosions . in most of these works ,",
    "the hadronic phase was described using phenomenological relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models based on effective lagrangian densities @xcite . among the different rmf models ,",
    "one of the most popular parametrizations is that of glendenning and moszkowski @xcite of the non - linear walecka model which has been widely used to study the effect of the hadronic equation of state ( eos ) on the nucleation process . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of different hyperon couplings on the critical mass and stellar conversion energy was analyzed .",
    "it was found that increasing the value of the hyperon coupling constants , the stellar metastability threshold mass and the value of the critical mass increase , thus making the formation of quark stars less likely . in all",
    "these works the mit bag model @xcite was used to describe the deconfined phase . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two models that contain explicitly the chiral symmetry were applied to describe the quark phase , namely the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the chromo dielectric model ( cdm ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that it is very difficult to populate the quark star branch using that version of the njl model and , therefore , all compact stars would give pure hadronic stars in that case . on the contrary , with the cdm , both hadronic and quark star configurations can be formed .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , was discussed the possibility of quark matter nucleation using the microscopic brueckner - hartree - fock approach to model the hadronic phase , and the three quark matter models cited above to describe the deconfined phase .",
    "the maximum neutron star mass predicted within this study was of @xmath4 , quite far from the almost @xmath0 pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 ( @xmath1 ) @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 ( @xmath2 ) @xcite , recently measured .    in the present work we investigate the nucleation of quark matter in cold hadronic matter using an hadronic eos based on three different rmf approaches",
    "we consider the tm1 @xcite , the tm1 - 2 @xcite and the nl3 @xcite models .",
    "the tm1 and tm1 - 2 models satisfy the heavy - ion flow constraints for symmetric matter around densities @xmath5-@xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite ( being @xmath8 @xmath9 the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter ) .",
    "nl3 , on the contrary , does not satisfy these constraints",
    ". however it has been used in @xcite as the hadronic eos in a scenario that allows for hybrid stars with masses above @xmath5 @xmath10 .",
    "a hard hadronic eos seems to be a necessary condition for the existence of massive hybrid stars .",
    "although it is well known that hyperons are expected to appear in the neutron star interior at densities @xmath11 and play a decisive role for several properties of such objects , we will ignore them in this work since , as mention in the abstract , we are mostly interested in the study of the role of the vector interaction and the phenomenological bag constant in the njl model , and on the determination whether the quark star branch may be populated .    for the quark phase we employ the version of the njl model presented in ref .  @xcite but neglecting the superconducting terms . in this way we get an upper bound in our results , since it is generally accepted that superconductivity softens the eos . in the version of the njl model of ref .",
    "@xcite , a phenomenological bag constant @xmath12 was introduced in order to define the location of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "a task of the present work is to delineate the region of parameters of our models that allow for the formation of stable high mass neutron stars after the nucleation process .",
    "for the formation of an hybrid star it is important that the nucleation time of the metastable hadronic star , from which it originates , be smaller than the age of the universe .",

    "their presence in neutron stars has been studied by many authors using either phenomenological @xcite and microscopic @xcite approaches since the pioneer work of ambartsumyan and saakyan @xcite .",
    "it is well known that their appearance softens the eos leading to a substantial reduction of the neutron star mass .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the inclusion of mesons with hidden strangeness and , particularly , a weak scalar coupling and a strong vector coupling , may give rise to a quite hard eos allowing for quite massive stars with hyperonic degrees of freedom @xcite",
    ". however , our present knowledge of the hyperon interactions ( particularly , the hyperon - hyperon one ) is yet not very well constrained by experimental data .",
    "therefore , the result of these works should be taken with care .",
    "the results of our calculation without hyperons should be interpreted just as an upper limit for the maximum star mass .",
    "if it is not possible to get a two - solar mass neutron star including only nucleonic degrees of freedom in the hadronic phase , then the presence of hyperons most probably will only worsen this situation .",

    "in fact , the nucleation process described above takes into account the surface energy and , therefore , the lowest mass configurations of hybrid stars obtained within the gibbs construction will not be populated because their central pressures lie below the pressure of the critical mass configuration .",

    "we have obtained slightly less massive stars than the ones predicted by tm1 - 2 one .",
    "we want to stress that the largest stable final mass obtained with the nl3 model , namely @xmath162 @xmath10 , is a neutron star containing a quark core while the largest mass predicted by the tm1 - 2 model , that reads @xmath163 , is an hybrid star with a central core made of a mixed phase .",
    "these values are both compatible with the mass of the pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite , @xmath164 , and psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite , @xmath165 .",
    "note that if after nucleation the star suffers a long - term mass accretion from a companion star in a binary system a star as massive as @xmath166 @xmath10 could be achieved within the tm1 parametrization .    according to the calculations performed in this work , the location of the deconfinement phase transition in the phase diagram of qcd , which in our work",
    ", depends on the hadronic eos used and the phenomenological bag pressure @xmath12 , plays a very important role on the existence of quark matter in neutron stars .",
    "in addition the hadronic part of the system should be sufficiently hard to preserve star stability .",
    "it was shown that not all massive quark star configurations are populated after nucleation .",
    "in particular , a too large surface tension may originate a black - hole after nucleation . in order to have conclusive results a study of the possibility that nucleation occurs at finite temperature should still be carried out .",
    "the vector interaction in the quark model allows the formation of hybrid stars with a pure quark core , however , this is only possible if the hadronic eos is very hard .",
    "in particular , using an eos that at intermediate densities was designed to satisfy the upper limit of the constraints obtained in @xcite , it is possible to obtain hybrid stars only if no vector interaction or just a weak one is included in the njl model .    we conclude that more conclusive results depend on a better knowledge of a ) the hadronic eos at intermediate densities , b ) the surface energy of a quark cluster in a hadronic matter background and c ) the hyperon interaction .",
