    "@xmath10 stands for the normalized lebesgue area measure of the unit disc .",
    "observe that for a univalent function @xmath8 , the integral above is just the area of @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote respectively the hardy and bergman spaces on @xmath5 , and that @xmath15 if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "the recent monograph @xcite is an excellent source to learn about the dirichlet space and its particular issues .",
    "if @xmath3 is an analytic function on @xmath17 with @xmath18 , then the equation @xmath19 defines a composition operator @xmath20 on the space of all holomorphic functions on the unit disc @xmath21 . on the dirichlet space @xmath1 ,",
    "a necessary condition for @xmath20 to be bounded is that @xmath22 . nevertheless , not all the dirichlet functions induce bounded composition operators on @xmath1 .",
    "such functions were characterized in 1980 by c. voas @xcite in his ph.d .  thesis .    in this work ,",
    "we shall be concerned with weighted composition operators on @xmath7 : for @xmath23 and @xmath24 a holomorphic self - map of @xmath5 we define the weighted composition operator @xmath25 on @xmath7 by @xmath26 noting that @xmath25 is not , in principle , a bounded operator on @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath20 is a bounded operator on @xmath7 and @xmath27 is a _ multiplier _ of @xmath7 , that is , the toeplitz operator @xmath28 is defined everywhere on @xmath7 and hence bounded , the weighted composition operator @xmath25 on @xmath7 is obviously bounded .",
    "a well known fact about the dirichlet space is that the algebra @xmath29 consisting of the multipliers of @xmath7 is not that easy to describe .",
    "indeed , their elements were characterized by stegenga @xcite in a remarkable paper in terms of a condition involving the logarithmic capacity of their boundary values . in particular , the strict inclusion @xmath30 holds . here",
    "@xmath31 denotes the space of bounded analytic functions in @xmath5 endowed with the sup - norm . a straightforward reformulation in terms of carleson measures for @xmath7 ( that is , there is a continuous injection from @xmath7 into @xmath32 ) , yields the fact that @xmath33 if and only if @xmath27 is bounded and the measure @xmath34 defined by latexmath:[$d\\mu(z)=    refer to @xcite for multipliers and carleson measures in dirichlet spaces ( and to @xcite for more on the subject of multipliers ) .",
    "concerning boundedness of weighted composition operators on @xmath7 , let us remark that one may construct self - maps of the unit disc @xmath3 such that @xmath36 and a multiplier @xmath37 such that @xmath0 is bounded in the dirichlet space .",
    "for instance , let @xmath38 and let @xmath24 be the infinite blaschke product with zeroes @xmath39 .",
    "now @xmath40 , so @xmath41 is clearly unbounded .",
    "however , for @xmath15 we have @xmath42 now the first term is clearly in the bergman space @xmath14 , while for the second term we observe that @xmath43 is a bounded analytic function in @xmath5 and @xmath44 , so that it also lies in @xmath14 ( with control of norms ) , showing that @xmath25 is bounded on @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , facing the problem of describing the weighted composition operators taking @xmath7 boundedly into itself deals not only with the multipliers of @xmath7 but also with those self - maps of the unit disc that may induce unbounded composition operators in @xmath7 .",
    "at this regards , for a self - map @xmath24 of the unit disc @xmath5 , we define the _ multiplier space _ @xmath45 associated to @xmath24 by @xmath46 it is clear that if @xmath41 is bounded on @xmath7 , then @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath24 induces an unbounded @xmath48 in @xmath7 , then @xmath29 is no longer contained in @xmath45 since , in such a case , this latter space does not contain the constant functions .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "on one hand , we are interested in identifying the multiplier space @xmath45 for self - maps @xmath3 of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , we will be able to characterize the extreme cases whenever @xmath24 is a self - map of @xmath5 belonging to @xmath7 .",
    "let us remark here that in the case of the hardy space @xmath13 , where @xmath41 is automatically bounded and the multiplier space is @xmath49 , gallardo - gutirrez , kumar and partington proved that @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath52 if and only if @xmath24 is a finite blaschke product ; this latter statement was showed previously in a different way in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us also point out that in the course of our findings , we will prove a _ decomposition theorem _ for the dirichlet space ( cf .",
    "theorem [ thm : decomp ] ) , which is interesting in its own and whose proof is based on the theory of model spaces for the shift operator in the hardy space ( see @xcite for more information about model spaces ) .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time model spaces come into play with the dirichlet space .",
    "on the other hand , we are interested in the spectral properties of weighted composition operators in @xmath7 . in @xcite , higdon computed the spectrum of composition operators in @xmath7 induced by linear fractional self - maps of @xmath5 .",
    "the techniques developed there were quite different from those carried over by cowen in @xcite in the corresponding case of the hardy space @xmath13 ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) , due to the particular nature of @xmath7 .    in a very recent work , hyvrinen , lindstrm , nieminen and saukko @xcite",
    "have described the spectra of invertible weighted composition operators @xmath25 acting on a large class of analytic function spaces including the weighted bergman and the weighted hardy spaces ; generalizing previous results obtained in @xcite . nevertheless , as they also remark , their results do not apply directly to the dirichlet space since they rely on the fact that the algebra of the multipliers of the spaces considered is @xmath53 .",
    "our aim is to extend hyvrinen , lindstrm , nieminen and saukko s results to the context of the dirichlet space @xmath7 , pointing out that their techniques are no longer working in @xmath7 .",
    "the last section of the paper gives a description of the spectra of invertible weighted composition operators .",
    "we first note ( see proposition [ prop:31 ] ) that a bounded weighted composition operator @xmath0 in the dirichlet space @xmath7 is invertible if and only if @xmath27 is a multiplier bounded away from zero in @xmath5 and @xmath3 is an automorphism of the unit disc .",
    "consequently , three separate cases are considered , depending on the nature of the disc automorphism @xmath3 : elliptic , parabolic or hyperbolic .",
    "when @xmath3 is parabolic , causal operators will play a prominent role in order to determine explicitly the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we study boundedness of weighted composition operators in the dirichlet space . in order to show the results at this respect , we prove a _ decomposition theorem _ for @xmath7 based on model spaces .",

    "since @xmath55 is finite - dimensional and all norms are equivalent .",
    "we proceed to state the _ decomposition theorem _ in its full generality , since the main arguments of the proof also work for the bergman space .",
