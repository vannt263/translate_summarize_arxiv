    "being confirmed such a tendency would be in consent with the hypothesis that at least an intermediate - range order may be present in the spatial distribution of alss .",
    "still more pronounced regular spatial variations of the standard ( see section  [ s : cf ] ) two - point correlation function of galaxy superclusters were obtained , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors indicated the possibility of a long - range ( or intermediate - range ) order with a characteristic period of @xmath188  mpc in the spatial distribution of superclusters : the largest relatively isolated bounded systems .",
    "their results are qualitatively consistent with the two - point correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ xisig ] .",
    "@xcite considered a model of a quasi - regular lattice with random distribution of clusters and superclusters along lattice edges .",
    "they showed that the spatial correlation function for a partly regular structure displays oscillations similar to those revealed in the correlation function of superclusters .    by analogy with @xcite we consider in the appendix two toy models of partly regular structures with essential random components and",
    "calculate the power spectrum of radial distribution of points .",
    "the power spectra for both models display the peaks with approximately the same significance as in fig .",
    "[ p - part - k ] .",
    "it illustrates that rather moderate spatial ordering might yield the periodicity of radial distribution similar to the sample of alss discussed here .",
    "it should be emphasized that we represent only visual examples of partly ordered structure without strict arguments in favour of the spatial interpretation of the periodicity obtained .",
    "this interpretation should be verified by special investigations in a future .",
