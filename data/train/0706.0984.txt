    "over the last fifteen years , considerable effort has gone into trying to analyse nuclear forces using the systematic tools of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "the starting point was weinberg s original proposal @xcite that these forces could be described within the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "this approach organises the terms in the effective lagrangian or hamiltonian according to powers of low - energy scales they contain .",
    "these scales , generically denoted @xmath2 , include momenta and the pion mass . in this ",
    "weinberg \" power counting , the leading terms of the nucleon - nucleon potential are one - pion exchange ( ope ) and an energy - independent contact interaction , both of which are of order @xmath3 .",
    "weinberg also noted the enhancement of the nonrelativistic two - nucleon propagator near threshold and proposed that the leading terms in the potential should be iterated to all orders in order to generate nonperturbative effects , such as the deuteron bound state .",
    "this approach , referred to here as the ",
    "weinberg  van - kolck \" ( wvk ) scheme , has been widely applied by van kolck and collaborators and by many others . however , even with this enhancement , nucleon - nucleon loop integrals are of order @xmath2 .",
    "although this is lower than the order @xmath4 expected in a relativistic theory , it means that each iteraction of the leading potential in a scattering equation raises the order by one power of @xmath2 .",
    "hence the resulting amplitude should still be perturbatively expandable in powers of the scales @xmath2 .    in order to justify treating the leading terms in the potential nonperturbatively ,",
    "a further ir enhancement is needed , to promote them to order @xmath5 .",
    "such a promotion is only possible within a consistent power counting if we can identify additional low - energy scales in the nucleon - nucleon system . in the case of @xmath6-wave scattering ,",
    "the large scattering lengths provide such scales , and these lead to an eft in which the leading , energy - independent contact terms are treated nonperturbatively @xcite . at low energies , where the finite - range of ope is not resolved ,",
    "the resulting expansion of the potential is simply the effective - range expansion @xcite .",
    "although a similar systematic justification for the iteration of ope was not provided , the wvk scheme has been successfully used to describe a variety of few - nucleon systems and their interactions .",
    "nonetheless , its validity in the @xmath7@xmath8 channel has been questioned @xcite and , more recently , several groups have observed that weinberg power counting can break down for nucleon - nucleon scattering in spin - triplet channels with nonzero orbital angular momentum @xcite . in particular , nogga , timmermans and van kolck @xcite",
    "find that the leading contact interactions can be substantially promoted in channels where tensor ope is attractive , although this conclusion does depend on the choice of cut - off , as stressed by epelbaum and meissner @xcite .    to establish a quantitative form for this new power counting , we need first to identify a low - energy scale that would justify iterating ope , and then to analyse the scale dependence of the associated short - range interactions .",
    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) @xcite provides the natural tool for such an analysis . in its wilsonian version , it has been applied to two - body scattering by short - range forces , showing that the effective - range expansion is based on a nontrivial fixed point of the rg flow @xcite .",
    "distorted - wave methods have been used to extend the approach to systems with known long - range forces @xcite .",
    "once a factor of @xmath9 has been divided out of the hamiltonian , the strength of the ope potential can be expressed in terms of the momentum scale @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pseudovector @xmath12n coupling constant . in the chiral limit",
    ", it can be written @xmath13 where @xmath14 the nucleon mass , @xmath15 is the axial coupling of the nucleon and @xmath16 the pion decay constant . in strict chpt , @xmath17 is therefore a high - energy scale , built out of @xmath18 and @xmath14 .",
    "none - the - less its numerical value is small , only about twice @xmath19 . as a result",
    ", perturbative treatments of ope ( as advocated by kaplan , savage and wise @xcite ) fail to converge or converge only slowly @xcite .",
    "this suggests that we should explore the consequences of identifying @xmath17 as a low - energy scale , counting it as of order @xmath2 . since @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath9 , this",
    "can be thought of as a concrete version of weinberg s suggestion that @xmath9 should be treated as if it were of order @xmath2 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , i applied a renormalisation group analysis to the short - range potential in the presence of tensor ope .",
    "this made use of the distorted waves ( dw s ) of a @xmath20 potential ( the chiral limit of tensor ope ) . in the resulting power counting ,",
    "the leading short - range potential is of order @xmath21 , independently of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this is quite different from weinberg counting , where the leading term in the @xmath22-th partial wave is of order @xmath23 .",
    "subleading terms containing powers of the energy appear at orders @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and so on .",
    "this promotion of short - range terms confirms the numerical observations of nogga , timmermans and van kolck @xcite and makes quantitative the new counting proposed there .",
    "the terms in the resulting potential can be directly related to a dw born expansion , similar to that in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the validity of this counting does depend on the energies considered , since in each channel there is critical momentum above which waves penetrate the centrifugal barrier and reach the region where the @xmath20 singularity dominates .",
    "the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite show that a nonperturbative treatment of ope , and hence the new counting , is needed in the @xmath6 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 waves for momenta of order @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , waves with @xmath1 do not probe the singularity until momenta of @xmath28  gev are reached . in these higher partial waves",
    "ope can be treated as a perturbation and short - distance interactions can be organised according to the usual weinberg power counting .",
    "the results of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite were purely formal , leading to the power counting that governs the importance of the terms in the expansion of the short - range potential .",
    "in the present paper , i explore its practical consequences by analysing nucleon - nucleon scattering in spin - triplet channels , with an extension of the method applied to singlet channels in ref .",
    "for simplicity i consider only the uncoupled waves : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the extension of the method to coupled waves such as @xmath7@xmath8 or @xmath33@xmath34 is very similar in principle , but is technically more complicated because of the matrix nature of the equations .",
    "the rg analysis relies on the forms of the dw s at small radii , where they tend to asymptotic forms that are independent of energy .",
    "these waves are obtained by solving the schdinger equation , as described in sec .",
    "ii . at small enough radii",
    "they show nonperturbative behaviour controlled by the @xmath20 singularity of the tensor potential . in the case of waves with @xmath0",
    ", this region extends out to about 1  fm . for lab kinetic energies up to 300  mev the waves reach their asymptotic forms only for radii less than about 0.6  fm , and there",
    "they are dominated by the @xmath20 potential .",
    "this nonperturbative behaviour is present in waves with @xmath1 , but only for only for radii less than about 0.2 fm . in the range 0.20.6",
    "fm they have the normal power - law forms associated with the centrifugal barrier .",
    "this confirms the expectations in refs .",
    "@xcite that low partial waves need the new power counting for energies in this range , whereas the higher waves can still be described perturbatively using weinberg counting .",
    "i then use dw methods to  deconstruct \" empirical scattering amplitudes by removing the effects of known long - range - forces .",
    "the residual amplitude can then be interpreted directly in terms of an effective short - range potential .",
    "this technique can provide a better indication of how well the known forces are able to describe the scattering , compared to simply plotting phase shifts .",
    "such plots can be misleading since they tend to hide small differences in peripheral waves at low energies , which is just where the long - range forces should dominate .",
    "if the resulting potential still shows strongly nonlinear energy dependence at low energies , then this implies that long - range forces are still making important contributions .",
    "short - range forces lead to a smooth energy dependence that can be expanded as a power series .    as in the similar treatment of singlet channels @xcite ,",
    "i take several nijmegen pwa s or potentials @xcite , to give an indication of the uncertainties involved in these analyses of the data . in sec .",
    "iii , i use them to construct scattering amplitudes between the dw s of the ope potential and from these i extract short - range potentials in the uncoupled spin - triplet channels .",
    "the resulting potentials show rapid energy dependence at low energies , indicating that important long - range physics is still present .",
    "the most obvious long - range forces that need to be removed next are two - pion exchange ( tpe ) and relativistic corrections to ope .",
    "these appear at orders @xmath4 and @xmath35 ( in weinberg counting ) .",
    "i use here the forms of the tpe potentials given in refs .",
    "@xcite and the corresponding order-@xmath4 correction to ope @xcite . at this order",

    "@xcite suggest that the standard weinberg counting should be adequate for the energies considered here .",

    "subtraction of the long - range forces leaves small residual interactions , as in the corresponding singlet channels studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "provided the cut - off radius is larger than about 0.1  fm , there is no sign of any divergences whose renormalisation would require the new power counting .",
    "these results indicate that the spin - triplet waves with @xmath0 can be analysed consistently using the nonperturbative power counting developed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results show that deconstructing scattering amplitudes , using the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , can provide a very useful tool for determining effective potentials directly from empirical phase shifts .",
    "it should be straightforward to extend the method to coupled channels , such as @xmath7@xmath8 , despite the more complicated matrix equations involved .",
    "it would also be interesting to use it to subtract two- and three - pion exchanges at order @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "however the approach also demonstrates that there are significant uncertainties in the currently available nijmegen pwa s , particularly for energies below about 80 mev where the scattering is most sensitive to long - range forces . as a result , attempts to study the importance of higher - order forces may require the newer pwa s of refs .",
