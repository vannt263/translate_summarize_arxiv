    "over the past few decades , a large amount of evidence in support of the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been assembled , see e.g. , refs  @xcite . to describe the properties of dm has become one of the main issues not only in cosmology but also in particle physics , since the standard model leaves no room for its existence , which means extending it is necessary .",
    "some of the most studied particle candidates of dm are weakly interacting massive particles such as the lightest neutral supersymmetric particle , the neutralino ( an in - depth review can be found in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "if dm interacts with regular matter , it may scatter in astrophysical bodies such as the sun and become gravitationally bound . over time , this can lead to a large accumulation of dm , the effect of which used to be one of the proposed explanations of the solar neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "this idea was later discarded in favour of neutrino flavour conversion by the neutral current phase of the sno experiment  @xcite . since the downward revision of heavy elements in the standard solar model @xcite , theoretical predictions and observations of helioseismology do not match and the sun now faces the solar composition problem @xcite .",
    "again , a proposed solution is dm trapped in the sun due to its interaction with regular matter .",
    "the idea is that dm particles collide with nuclei in the sun , lose enough energy to become gravitationally bound and to eventually settle in the solar core after additional scattering .",
    "once in the core , dm can scatter off of the thermal distribution of nuclei and gain some energy which is then lost by scattering in the outer regions of the sun , the result of which is a lower core temperature  @xcite .",
    "this would ultimately affect helioseismology and possibly provide a cure for the solar composition problem .",
    "the shift in temperature of the solar core would also change the solar neutrino fluxes that are observed by experiments , in particular the @xmath0b flux which varies as @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the effects of dm captured by the sun has been extensively studied for various dm models  @xcite and also in other stars  @xcite .",
    "annihilating dm can also provide a channel for indirect detection of dm as a flux of high energy neutrinos from these annihilations might be detectable on earth .",
    "such signals are being searched for by neutrino telescopes  @xcite . in the case where the dm has self - interactions , dm particles already captured by the sun",
    "provide a possibility of dm self - capture , which could lead to higher concentrations of dm inside the sun .",
    "if dm annihilations produce high - energy neutrinos , this would increase the number of annihilations and thus the signal in neutrino telescopes could be enhanced  @xcite .",
    "energy injection into the sun by the dm annihilation products has been studied , but requires the halo density to be many orders of magnitude higher than the local density for the star to be affected  @xcite .",
    "the models which achieve the highest numbers of captured dm particles in the sun are models in which annihilation is suppressed or does not occur at all , the latter of which is the case in asymmetric dm ( adm ) models , reviews of which can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in  @xcite that self - interacting adm may alleviate the solar composition problem but it was shown in @xcite that adm models are incapable of doing so with the cross - sections allowed by direct detection experiments .",
    "recently , there have been improvements of the standard solar model using dm has been achieved with long range interactions  @xcite and momentum - dependent cross sections  @xcite .",
    "common for the models described above is that they contain only one species of dm particles . in this paper",
    "we will study the accumulation of dm in the sun under the assumption that it is a self - interacting dirac fermion and that the dm halo is composed of equal amounts of dm and anti - dm particles .",
    "this opens up a possibility for an asymmetry in the captured number of dm and anti - dm to occur , either due to different capture cross sections for dm and anti - dm on solar nuclei or due to random fluctuations in the capture process . moreover",
    ", the more abundant species of captured dm can not fully annihilate with its counterpart which allows for large number of captured particles even for an annihilation cross section expected for thermal relic dm .",
    "if the size of the population of captured dm of the models considered here can compete with the adm models , dm of the standard freeze - out scenario may alter solar observables .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ section2 ] , we present the framework that governs the amount of dm and anti - dm present in the sun and discuss the behaviour of the dm to anti - dm asymmetry in the limiting cases .",
    "then , in section  [ section3 ] , we apply our framework to the case of the sun and in section  [ section4 ] we present our results .",
    "finally , in section  [ section5 ] , we summarise our results and present our conclusions .",
    "we model the total number of dm particles in the sun @xmath2 and the total number of anti - dm particles in the sun @xmath3 using the coupled system of first order differential equations @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the capture rates on solar nuclei for dm and for anti - dm , respectively , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 will depend on the self - capture rates of dm and anti - dm and on the ejection rates of dm and anti - dm that is already trapped by incoming particles from the dm halo . the dm  anti - dm annihilation rate is given by @xmath9 . in principle ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 also include evaporation effects , but it has been shown that this is negligible for dm particles with a mass @xmath10  gev  @xcite and we will neglect it in the following discussion .",
    "we define the asymmetry @xmath11 as the difference between the dm and anti - dm numbers , @xmath12 .",
    "it evolves according to @xmath13 where we have defined @xmath14 and @xmath15 . assuming negligible amounts of both dm and anti - dm at the birth of the sun , @xmath16 , we find @xmath17 an important note is that the absolute value of @xmath11 also represents the minimum amount of dark particles ( dm or anti - dm ) present in the sun .",
    "the sum of dm and anti - dm , @xmath18 , will at any time always be larger or equal to the asymmetry .",
    "another important note is that there is a geometric limit for the self - capture rates .",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath19 are large enough , our approach is no longer valid .",
    "when dm and anti - dm is trapped inside the sun , they will accumulate in the center roughly inside a sphere of radius @xmath20 ( derived in the next section ) .",
    "when @xmath21 is larger than the cross - sectional area of the sphere , @xmath22 , every incoming dm particle will scatter off either trapped dm or anti - dm . when the distributions of trapped dm and anti - dm are identical , the fraction of collisions of dm on dm is @xmath23 while the fraction of collisions on anti - dm is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the same argument holds for incoming anti - dm except the total cross section @xmath25 can not exceed @xmath22 . in this case , the fraction of collisions on dm is given by @xmath26 with all @xmath2 and @xmath19 interchanged .",
    "similarly , the fraction of collisions on anti - dm is given by @xmath27 , again with @xmath2 and @xmath19 interchanged .",
    "when this occurs , the equation for @xmath11 will fail since eqs . and must be corrected in order to take the geometric limit into account .      when the scattering cross section of dm and anti - dm on solar nuclei are different , @xmath5 and @xmath28 are different and thus @xmath29 .",
    "we choose @xmath5 to be larger than @xmath28 ( identifying anti - dm as the species with lower capture probability on solar matter ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath11 is @xmath30 which has three interesting limits : @xmath31 when @xmath32 is small , self - capture is negligible and the asymmetry will be proportional to the difference in the capture rates . when @xmath33 , the system eventually stabilizes , since the additional capture of anti - dm by already captured dm balances the difference in the capture rate on normal matter . for @xmath34 ,",
    "dm captures itself at a larger rate than anti - dm .",
    "once this process becomes dominant , it leads to an exponential increase in the amount of dm captured in the sun .",
    "when the capture rates are equal ( @xmath35 ) , the amount of dm might at some point be larger than the amount of anti - dm simply due to random variations in the capture process which can be modelled by adding a white noise signal @xmath36 to the capture rates @xmath37 the white noise is normalized such that the expected number of captured dm particles and its variation matches those of a poisson distribution , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "we find that @xmath39 and hence @xmath40 .",
    "using the same argument for the capture rate of anti - dm with a white noise signal @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 since @xmath43 and @xmath41 are independent , @xmath44 has the properties @xmath45 the expectation value of the asymmetry @xmath11 is zero , which should be expected since the probability of having an over - abundance of dm to anti - dm must be the same as that of having an over - abundance of anti - dm due to symmetry . to estimate the typical magnitude of the asymmetry",
    ", we can study the standard deviation of the stochastic variable @xmath11 , given by @xmath46 .",
    "we find that @xmath47 thus , the limiting behaviour is similar to the case for intrinsic different capture rates @xmath48 the major difference is that the short time limit @xmath49 gives an asymmetry that is expected to grow with the square root of @xmath50 rather than linearly and that the coefficients are related to @xmath51 and @xmath52 by a square root . for small @xmath32 ,",
    "we note that this result is precisely what would be expected from the difference between two poisson distributions of expectation value @xmath53 while an equilibrium or an exponential growth occur for strong self - capture .",
    "for a self - interacting model of dm , the total capture of dm in the sun will be the sum of a capture rate due to interactions with solar nuclei , a term proportional to the already captured dm and a similar term proportional to the number of captured anti - dm particles .",
    "the capture of anti - dm is completely analogous to dm capture although the rates may differ depending on the various scattering cross sections .",
    "the specific formulas to compute the capture rates and ejection rates are presented in the appendix but the complexity of the capture rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 requires some discussion . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the time it takes for a captured dm particle to fall into thermal equilibrium in the solar core is negligible .",
    "generally , the formula for the capture rates of dm by dm and anti - dm as well as the ejection rates are given by : @xmath54 the factor @xmath55 is the rate at which a particle with velocity @xmath56 will scatter at radius @xmath57 and contain information on the probability that the incoming particle is captured and whether the target particle is ejected or not .    the rate of capture of an incoming particle without ejecting the target particle is given by @xmath58 depending on the collision , the scattering cross section @xmath59 is either @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "the velocity of the particle before it falls into the gravitational potential is @xmath62 and the velocity at radius @xmath57 is then @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the escape velocity .",
    "the knudsen number is a measure of the distance dm particles travel on average between collisions and is given by @xmath65 the parameter @xmath20 is a length scale that describes the size of the distribution . for @xmath66 , particles travel a great distance between collisions and an isothermal assumption of the distribution is justified : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the normalization constant , @xmath69 is the temperature of the distribution and @xmath70 is the gravitational potential energy at radius @xmath57 from the core which is calculated from @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the total mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath57 around the solar core ; @xmath73 in the isothermal case , the normalization constant is @xmath74 and the length scale @xmath20 is defined as @xmath75 assuming a constant temperature @xmath76 and density @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 being the density and temperature in the solar center . indeed , for a dm particle with mass @xmath80  gev , the length scale @xmath81 which shows that the vast majority of captured dm particles are concentrated in a very small volume in the center of the sun .",
    "in the case of large scattering cross sections , @xmath82 , the particles scatter so often that they will be in local thermal equilibrium with the surrounding nuclei .",
    "the distribution for this case was derived in  @xcite which introduces a dependence on the temperature gradient .",
    "however , for the cross sections considered in this paper ( @xmath83  @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 and so we will work with the isothermal distribution . defining @xmath86 ,",
    "the distribution can be written @xmath87 .",
    "for anti - dm , the radial distribution is taken to be the same except @xmath88 .",
    "the ejection rate of dm captured by in the sun by collisions with dm or anti - dm from the halo is given by @xmath89 we must also take into account that while a dark matter particle is being ejected from the sun , it is also likely that the particle from the halo is captured by the same process .",
    "the rate for this exchange occurring is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the rate of ejections in which both the incoming halo particle and the particle from the sun are ejected , given by @xmath92 the possible cases depending on velocity for capture and ejection are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ejectcapture ] along with the velocity distribution of the standard halo model .     for different capture scenarios .",
    "the horizontal line represents the escape velocity @xmath93 in the center of the sun , where most of the dm resides .",
    "the vertical size of the colored regions represents the quantity which needs to be integrated along with the distribution @xmath94 in order to yield the capture rates .",
    "the black curve shows shape of @xmath94 at @xmath95  km / s for reference .",
    "[ fig : ejectcapture],scaledwidth=55.0% ]    as can be seen from this figure , the escape velocity will generally be so large that we expect that the self - capture will be dominant with some contribution from halo particles being captured while ejecting the target particle .    summarizing this ,",
    "the capture rates @xmath7 and @xmath96 relevant for the evolution of the dark matter and anti - dark matter numbers in the sun can be written as @xmath97 here , the single self - ejection events do not appear in @xmath7 , as the net change in the dm number in the sun is zero for these events , but the full ejection induced by the opposite species from the halo must be taken into account as the capture of the halo particle does not compensate for the ejected one .",
    "for the capture of dm on anti - dm , the relevant quantities are the capture without ejection and the ejection of the target particle while capturing the halo particle .",
    "the annihilation rate is computed as @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section .",
    "as long as @xmath100 , the upper limit of the integral can be set to @xmath101 rather than @xmath102 and the annihilation rate evaluates to @xmath103",
    "in the following , we will make some explicit assumptions in order to estimate the effects described in the previous sections .",
    "the velocity distribution @xmath104 of the halo is assumed to be a standard maxwell - boltzmann distribution shifted to the solar frame moving through the halo at @xmath105 km / s .",
    "it can be expressed as @xcite @xmath106 it is assumed that the dm and anti - dm components in the halo are identical and that the density of each are equal .",
    "they will then each have a density @xmath107  gev  @xmath108 , which is equal to half the total local dm density of @xmath109  gev  @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the number density of dm and anti - dm is therefore @xmath110 .",
    "the dark matter is assumed to scatter with regular matter with velocity independent spin - independent ( si ) and/or spin - dependent ( sd ) cross sections through effective operators .",
    "for the case of sd capture in the sun , we are interested in the bounds on the sd dm - proton cross section . limits on these cross sections have been set in various direct detection experiments @xcite . in the dm mass range @xmath111  gev ,",
    "the limit on the si cross section is @xmath112  @xmath84 @xcite . for smaller dm masses , the limits on the si cross section weakens significantly . for a @xmath113  gev",
    "dm particle , @xmath114  @xmath84 .",
    "the limits on the sd cross section in the mass range @xmath111  gev is @xmath115  @xmath84 @xcite . for a @xmath113  gev particle , the bound",
    "is slightly reduced to @xmath116  @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "limits on the self - interaction of dm comes from astrophysical sources .",
    "when galaxy clusters collide , drag forces acting on the gas while the dm passes through unhindered would produce an offset in the mass and gas distribution of the clusters , the size of which can be used to put upper limits on the self - interaction of dm . in  @xcite ,",
    "one such collision was analysed and and set an upper limit on the self - interacting cross section of @xmath117  @xmath84/gev .",
    "the relic abundance of dm has been precisely derived from wmap @xcite and planck @xcite experimental data .",
    "the thermally averaged annihilation cross section can be related to this relic abundance by solving the boltzmann equation which is done in e.g. , ref  @xcite and is here taken to be @xmath118  @xmath119/s .    as a model of the sun , the agss09 solar model @xcite is chosen .",
    "it contains the mass and radial distribution of elements up to ni . the solar age is taken to be @xmath120 byrs .",
    "the capture rate of a dm particle with mass @xmath80  gev is calculated to be at most @xmath121  s@xmath122 for a sd cross section of @xmath123  @xmath84 and @xmath124  s@xmath122 for a si cross section of @xmath125  @xmath84 . for a dm particle of mass @xmath126  gev ,",
    "the bounds push si capture down by four orders of magnitude even though for a fixed si cross section , the capture rate is only reduced at the percent level . thus , the sd cross section allows for higher capture rates for all masses in the range 5 - 1000 gev .     the self - capture rate @xmath127 ( black line ) , the exchange rate @xmath128 ( red line ) and the ejection rate @xmath129 ( blue line ) as a function of mass . ]",

    "however , the capture rates increase proportionally to the background density of dm so that larger self - capture rates may be expected for stars in regions where the background density is larger . even if the likelihood that the sun has a negligible asymmetry since the background density is small , stars in such regions may have a @xmath52 that is several orders of magnitude larger which would increase @xmath159 significantly thus affecting the evolution of such stars .    in this work ,",
    "we have neglected the fact that a stochastic capture rate on solar nuclei may imply a stochastic variation of the self - capture rates as well .",
    "one such scenario would occur if there are perturbations in the local background density .",
    "the investigation of this case is left for future work .",
    "this work was supported by the gran gustafsson foundation .",
    "the capture of dark matter in celestial bodies is a standard calculation , first done by press and spergel @xcite , later improved and corrected by gould @xcite . given the velocity distribution of halo dark matter , @xmath104 , in the frame of the sun where @xmath62 is the velocity very far away where the gravitational potential of the sun is negligible .",
    "the capture rate is given by @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the rate at which a particle with velocity @xmath56 at radius @xmath57 will scatter and lose enough energy to be captured .",
    "for the si cross section , gould found that @xmath180\\theta(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_+^2}-\\frac{u^2}{w^2})\\ ] ] while for the sd cross section @xmath181 @xmath182 is the radial distribution of element @xmath183 in the sun .",
    "the mass of and scattering cross section on element @xmath183 is @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "the mass of the dm particle is @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the si scattering cross section scale as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the number of nucleons in element @xmath183 and @xmath191 the reduced mass of element @xmath183 and the dm .",
    "@xmath192 is the proton scattering cross section and @xmath193 the reduced mass of the dm and the proton .",
    "the more complex formula for si scattering is due to the form factor which takes the nuclear structure of the target into account for larger energy transfers given by @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 is the mass of nuclei @xmath183 . for hydrogen ,",
    "this form factor is set to unity .",
    "the total capture rate for a si capture rate is then the sum of the capture rate by each individual element . for sd",
    "capture , hydrogen is the only element of importance since there is no @xmath197 enhancement of the cross sections on other elements and the fraction of elements with spin is completely negligible compared to hydrogen .",
    "if dm has a non - zero scattering cross section on other dm and anti - dm particles , it may also be captured by colliding with other dm and anti - dm particles .",
    "a derivation of self - capture is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and we review the result and add three cases for which the target particle is ejected . for self - capture , @xmath55 is broken down to @xmath198 here , @xmath59 is the dm self - scattering cross section , @xmath199 the radial distribution of already captured dm and @xmath200 the probability that the particle is captured in a collision while not giving the target particle enough energy to escape the sun .",
    "the projectile and target particles are gravitationally unbound when their kinetic energy is greater than @xmath201 .",
    "this means that , for capture of a particle without ejecting the target , the energy transfer @xmath202 must be in the interval @xmath203 the energy transfer distribution is assumed uniform on the interval which gives @xmath204 as @xmath205 and the self - capture rate is given by @xmath206      when the transferred energy in a collision involving dm and anti - dm is greater than @xmath201 , the particle that is hit will be gravitationally unbound and escape the sun .",
    "this ejection rate is calculated using the same formula as self - capture but with a different @xmath55 .",
    "we can divide ejection into two regions , one in which @xmath207 and one in which @xmath208 .    if @xmath207 and the incoming particle is trapped after a collision , the target particle may or may not be trapped .",
    "if the target is trapped , we have the case of self - capture that is described above .",
    "if the target particle is ejected , the transferred energy is in the range @xmath209 and @xmath179 is given by @xmath210    if @xmath208 , entrapment of the incoming particle will always result in the ejection of the target particle . in the case that the target particle is still trapped , @xmath202 falls in the interval @xmath211 the factor @xmath179 is then @xmath212 however , if @xmath202 falls in the interval @xmath213 the target particle will be ejected and the incoming particle will still have a velocity that is larger than the escape velocity and thus also escape . for this case",
