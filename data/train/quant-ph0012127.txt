    "lber  @xcite began the study of identification via quantum channels .",

    "quantum channels are a generalization of classical channels in the following sense : choose any orthonormal basis @xmath57 of the @xmath58dimensional hilbert space @xmath43 , and define for the classical channel @xmath5 the corresponding quantum channel @xmath59 by @xmath60 obviously for another channel @xmath61 one has @xmath62 .",

    "one consequence of this is that the transmission capacities of @xmath49 and of @xmath74 are equal : @xmath75 .",

    "abstractly , just given the states @xmath47 , this situation occurs if they pairwise commute : for then they are simultaneously diagonalizable , hence the orthonormal basis @xmath57 arises .    according to  @xcite a @xmath12 _ quantum identification ( qid ) code _ is a collection of pairs @xmath76 with probability distributions @xmath14 on @xmath15 , and operators @xmath77 on @xmath78 satisfying @xmath79 , such that the error probabilities of first resp .",

    "the girl however is capricious to the degree that it is impossible to predict who is her sweetheart at a given moment : when the message about the drowned sailor arrives , she will only ask for her present sweetheart , and only she will ask .    with our present approach we can get rid of the simultaneity condition in the converse ( whereas by the above theorem identification codes approaching the capacity can be designed to be simultaneous  namely , by  @xcite for any sort of channel and a transmission code of rate @xmath93 for it , one can construct an i d code `` on top '' of the transmission code , and with identification rate @xmath93 , asymptotically ) :    [ satz : qid : converse ] let @xmath28 such that @xmath33 .",
    "then for every @xmath29 and every sufficiently large @xmath30 @xmath34    the rest of the paper is divided into two major blocks : first , after a short review of the ideas from  @xcite in section  [ sec : id : proof ] , the rest of the main text will be devoted to the proof of theorem  [ satz : qid : converse ] ( as explained , this contains theorem  [ satz : id : converse ] indeed as a special case ) , in section  [ sec : qid : proof ] .",
    "the other block is the appendix , containing the fundamentals of a theory of ( selfadjoint ) operator valued random variables .",
    "there the large deviation bounds to be used in the main text are derived .",
    "the core of the proof of theorem  [ satz : id : converse ] in  @xcite is the following result about hypergraphs . recall that a _ hypergraph _ is a pair @xmath94 with a finite set @xmath95 of vertices , and a finite set @xmath96 of ( hyper ) edges @xmath97 .",

    "in fact , assuming @xmath131 for all @xmath100 , one easily sees that @xmath132    the idea for the proof of theorem  [ satz : id : converse ] is now : to replace the ( in principle ) arbitrary distributions @xmath14 on @xmath15 of a @xmath12 i d code @xmath133 , by uniform distributions on subsets of @xmath15 , with cardinality bounded essentially by @xmath39 .",
    "the condition is that the corresponding _ output _ distributions are close , so the resulting i d code will be a bit worse , but still nontrivial .",
    "this is done with the help of the covering lemma  [ lemma : covering:2 ] , applied to typical sequences in @xmath22 as vertices , and sets of induced typical sequences as edges .",
    "for details see  @xcite .",
    "it was already pointed out in the previous section that the main idea of the converse proof is to replace the arbitrary code distributions @xmath14 by regularized approximations , the quality of approximation being measured by the @xmath134distance of the output distributions .    hence , to extend the method to quantum channels we have to use the @xmath134distance of the output _ quantum states _ , and we have to find quantum versions of the lemmas  [ lemma : sanov ] and  [ lemma : covering:2 ] .",
