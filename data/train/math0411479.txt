    "in 1882 felix klein posed the question whether every abstract riemann surface @xmath1 can be realized in euclidean 3space .",
    "a positive answer to this question was given by a.  garsia @xcite and r.  redy @xcite , who proved that every riemann surface can be conformally embedded into @xmath2 .",
    "this immediately raises the question for the optimal geometric realizations in @xmath2 of a given abstract riemann surface , or , slightly more general , for the optimal ( especially beautiful , symmetric ... ) conformal immersions of a riemann surface into space .",
    "the same question may be raised about optimal realizations of topological types of surfaces , without the conformal constraint . in this context",
    ", there is a general agreement that an excellent way to make the notion of `` optimal '' precise is to look for surfaces that are critical points of the willmore functional @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to the notion of constrained willmore surfaces : an immersion @xmath4 of a riemann surface @xmath1 is a _ constrained willmore surface _",
    "if it is critical for @xmath5 under compactly supported infinitesimal conformal variations of @xmath6 .",
    "this generalizes the notion of _ willmore surfaces _ , the critical points of @xmath5 under all compactly supported variations . constrained willmore surfaces are a mbius invariant class of surfaces with strong links to the theory of integrable systems .",
    "the concept of constrained willmore surfaces already appears in @xcite .",
    "however , the euler  lagrange equation characterizing constrained willmore surfaces is nowhere actually derived from the variational problem , except for the simplest cases of compact surfaces of genus @xmath7 in  @xcite . examples of constrained willmore surfaces are constant mean curvature surfaces in 3dimensional space forms , see @xcite for the euclidean case and @xcite or section  [ sec : constr - willm - surf ] below for general space forms .    in section  [ sec : constrained_variational_problems ] , we derive the euler  lagrange equation for conformal immersions of compact riemann surfaces that are critical points of geometric functionals under infinitesimal conformal variations . in this euler  lagrange equation , a holomorphic quadratic differential appears as a lagrange multiplier . in the case of immersions of non ",
    "compact surfaces , the same euler  lagrange equation is still a sufficient ( but no longer necessary ) condition for being critical under the conformal constraint .    in section  [ sec : constr - minim - volume ] , we discuss examples of _ constrained minimal _ and _ constrained volume  critical _ surfaces , i.e. , immersions which are critical for area or enclosed volume under the conformal constraint .",
    "this yields valuable insights into variational problems of the type studied in section  [ sec : constrained_variational_problems ] .",
    "in particular , example  [ exa : constrained_no_q ] shows that the case of open surfaces is more delicate than the compact case : we construct a constrained minimal immersion that does not satisfy the euler - lagrange equation derived in section  [ sec : constrained_variational_problems ] .    in section  [ sec : constr - willm - surf ] , we specialize the previous results to constrained willmore surfaces and give a short proof of the fact that constant mean curvature surfaces are constrained willmore .",
    "moreover , we describe a phenomenon first observed in  @xcite : there are ( globally smooth ) immersions of compact surfaces that are constrained willmore after removing a finite number of points , but not constrained willmore as compact surfaces .",
    "this phenomenon seems to be typical for variational problems with conformal constraint : example  [ exa : discs_of_revolution ] in section  [ sec : constr - minim - volume ] shows that the same can be observed in the case of constrained minimal surfaces .    in the appendix",
    "we show that for non strongly isothermic immersions of compact surfaces all infinitesimal conformal variations may be realized as derivatives of genuine conformal variations , where _ strongly isothermic _",
    "means that the immersion admits a non  trivial , holomorphic quadratic differential with the property that the null directions of its real part are principal curvature directions of the immersion . as a consequence ,",
    "a non strongly isothermic immersion of a compact surface is a critical point of a geometric functional under infinitesimal conformal variations if and only if it is critical under genuine conformal variations .",
    "in this section we derive the euler  lagrange equation characterizing immersions of a compact riemann surface that are critical points of a geometric functional under the constraint that the conformal structure is infinitesimally preserved . in the case of",
    "non  compact surfaces , the equation thus obtained is still a sufficient condition for critical points , but ( as shown in section  [ sec : constr - minim - volume ] ) it is not necessary .    let @xmath1 be a riemann surface ( without boundary throughout ) and denote by @xmath8 a functional ( for non  compact surfaces it is sufficient that the functional @xmath8 is well defined on compact subsets of @xmath1 ) on the space of immersions of @xmath1 into some 3dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath9 . we suppose that @xmath8 is invariant under diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 , i.e. , that it depends only on the geometry of the immersion and not on the parametrization .",
