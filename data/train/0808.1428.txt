    "the novel feature of our work is that the simulations are performed directly at nonvanishing vacuum angle @xmath1 , in contrast to previous lattice studies  @xcite ( with the exception of  @xcite ) , which rely on reweighting correlation functions with topological charge that would otherwise vanish .",

    "before we compute the electric dipole moment now , let us look at the distribution of topological charge and its dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "having found that @xmath28 , the topological charge that follows from the chirally rotated action ( [ fa ] ) is the so - called fermionic charge @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fermion matrix .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ qf ] ) requires the computation of the @xmath77 lowest - lying eigenvalues of @xmath78 , which is numerically expensive .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that the fermionic charge and the so - called field theoretic charge , which is computed from the field strength tensor by applying an appropriate number of cooling sweeps and rounding the result to the nearest integer value , give consistent results . in the following",
    "we shall employ the field theoretic definition of the topological charge .",
    "it turns out that the results are rather independent of the degree of cooling .",
    "in fact , the numbers stabilize already after @xmath79 cooling sweeps .",
    "the numbers quoted here refer to @xmath77 cooling sweeps . for a recent appraisal of the cooling method see  @xcite .",
    ".the average topological charge and charge squared for our values of @xmath80 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ avcharge ]    in fig .  1 we show the charge distribution for our five different values of @xmath80 .",
    "to identify the shape of the distribution , and to see how it changes with increasing value of @xmath80 , we compare our data to a gaussian fit at @xmath81 and @xmath45 .",
    "a gaussian distribution is the most common distribution function for independent , randomly generated variables .    in table",
    "i we present the resulting average topological charge @xmath82 and charge squared , @xmath83 which we plot in figs .  2 and 3 . as with any distribution , besides the distributions mean , its skewness and kurtosis coefficients should be calculated in order to determine the type of distribution .",
    "we do so in figs .  4 and 5 , where we plot the skewness @xmath84 , @xmath85 and kurtosis @xmath4 , @xmath86 note that @xmath84 and @xmath4 have been normalized to @xmath87 , different from the mathematical literature , so that the volume dependence cancels out .",
    "let us first look at the charge distributions in fig .  1 . at @xmath88",
    "the lattice data show a higher probability than a gaussian distributed charge for intermediate values of @xmath89 and a slightly thinner tail , while at larger values of @xmath80 the distributions appears to show a sharper peak and fatter tail . on top of that ,",
    "the right tail becomes longer compared to the left one with increasing value of @xmath80 .",
    "this behavior is reflected in the skewness and kurtosis coefficients shown in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "skewness is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution .",
    "if the right tail of the distribution is more pronounced than the left one , the distribution is said to have positive skewness , which is what we observe at @xmath90 . if the reverse is true , it has negative skewness .",
    "kurtosis is the degree of peakedness of a distribution .",
    "a distribution with positive kurtosis is called leptokurtic and has an acute peak around its mean .",
    "examples of leptokurtic distributions include the laplace distribution .",
    "a distribution with negative kurtosis is called platykurtic and has a smaller peak around its mean and a lower probability than a gaussian distribution at extreme values .",
    "such distributions are termed sub - gaussian .",
    "$ ] is called sub - gaussian if @xmath91 is strictly increasing on @xmath92 . ]",
    "the kurtosis starts out negative at @xmath88 and rises almost linearly to reach positive values at @xmath93 . for recent quenched results",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "[ qfig ]    [ qfig2 ]    a popular model of the qcd vacuum is the dilute instanton gas  @xcite , whose charge distribution is given by a convolution of separate poisson distributions for instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "its free energy per spacetime volume v is @xmath94 where @xmath95 that leads to  @xcite @xmath96 which at imaginary @xmath1 gives @xmath97    in figs .  2 - 5 we compare the lattice data for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath84 and @xmath4 with the predictions of the gaussian distribution and the dilute instanton gas . while @xmath98 and @xmath99 are in reasonable agreement with the results of the gaussian and poisson distribution for smaller values of @xmath80 , the higher cumulants @xmath84 and @xmath4 show a far different trend over the entire range of @xmath80 than the predictions of these simple models .",
    "reweighting appears to be the accepted method for simulations at nonvanishing vacuum angle @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath100 .",
    "having results of a direct simulation at nonvanishing value of @xmath1 at hand , it is instructive to test how reliable the method actually is , given the fact that the simulations are necessarily restricted to a finite volume with limited absolute value of the topological charge .",
    "the reweighted charges are given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the probability of finding a configuration of charge @xmath7 in the ensemble of configurations , and @xmath103 at imaginary @xmath104 this becomes @xmath105    in figs .",
    "2 and 3 we compare @xmath98 and @xmath87 with the reweighted numbers , where we have converted @xmath1 to @xmath40 using ( [ bar ] ) . on the quantitative level",
    ", reweighting is not able to describe the data for @xmath106 .",
    "the reason is that the reweighted charge distributions have largely the same form as the initial @xmath88 distribution , but are merely shifted towards negative @xmath7 values , while the shape of the true charge distributions changes significantly with increasing value of @xmath80 .",
    "we may expect to find better agreement on larger volumes , provided @xmath107 is analytic in @xmath1 .",

    "the use of partially twisted boundary conditions has allowed us to compute the proton and neutron form factor @xmath129 with high precision over the entire range of momenta down to @xmath167 , which greatly facilitated the extrapolation to @xmath147 .",
    "a further improvement of our calculation is that it does not require reweighting of the three - point functions ( [ rw ] ) with the topological charge .",
    "barring the fact that the lattice definition of topological charge is ambiguous , to some extent , reweighting does not describe the charge distribution accurately beyond @xmath168 , which casts some doubts on the method , if taken at face value .",
    "having demonstrated the benefit of simulations at imaginary @xmath1 , the next step is to extend the calculations to more realistic quark masses and larger lattices .",
    "the idea then is to make contact to the predictions of chiral perturbation theory , which allow for the extrapolation of the dipole moment from finite to infinite volume and to the physical quark mass  @xcite .",

    "it is reassuring that @xmath172 , which indicates good chiral properties already .",
    "but there is the potential danger that the remaining @xmath173 corrections will interfere with the assumed form of the nucleon matrix element ( [ rw ] ) and give rise to systematic errors  @xcite . to fully rule that out",
