    "the notion of a complex cone contraction with an associated hyperbolic projective metric was introduced by rugh in @xcite . there",

    "the quantity @xmath6 is a measure of the size of this gap .",
    "a simpler hyperbolic metric was subsequently introduced by dubois in @xcite , who gave explicit estimates for the size of the spectral gap in the case of matrices .",
    "we show here that his simple estimate carries over to a linear operator that contracts a complexified real cone in any complexified banach space .",

    "our key observation is that we may associate to any complexified real cone a natural pre - order . using this",
    "we show that the leading eigenvalue is given by a variational or max / min principle .",

    "* section 1.3 ) for a more modern treatment ) .",
    "we present here only results for complexified real cones as they are computationally much simpler to treat than general complex cones .",
    "the upshot both for the spectral gap and the lower bound is that it suffices to look at certain collections of complex 2 by 2 matrices of ` matrix elements ' and the contraction properties of the associated linear fractional transformations on the riemann sphere . for our proofs",
    "we rely upon @xcite for matricial calculations and @xcite for the spectral gap properties .",
    "let @xmath7 be a real banach space and @xmath8 a complexification of @xmath7 .",

    "the operator @xmath71 maps @xmath13 to @xmath13 , is strictly positive on @xmath47 and is a strict contraction ( the image is in fact one dimensional ) but @xmath72 so it has no spectral gap .",
    "we want to avoid this situation .",
    "when @xmath47 is an archimedian generating set for @xmath13 and @xmath73 then it is easy to see that if @xmath48 ( so is non - zero ) , then also @xmath74 .",
    "below we show that a similar property holds in the complex setting .",

    "if @xmath722   and   @xmath724   then  @xmath721 .",
    "proof : first note that the equivalence of the last three conditions in ( 1 ) follows from lemma [ properties of cpn ] and the symmetry of the last expression .",
    "it is convenient to distinguish cases according to the rank of @xmath182 .",
    "the zero - matrix is in @xmath716 and not in @xmath715 which is consistent with ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "so let us consider the case of rank @xmath725 : we may then write @xmath726 in order to show ( 1 ) we note that @xmath727 is equivalent to @xmath728 which is the same as @xmath729 . in this case the inequality @xmath730 is automatic so we get the equivalence with @xmath182 being in @xmath715 . to see ( 2 ) consider the vectors @xmath731 , @xmath732 , @xmath267 and @xmath268 which are the images of the ` polar ' vectors @xmath733 by @xmath182 and @xmath266 .",
    "these vectors belong to @xmath269 precisley when the real parts of @xmath734 are non - negative .",
    "the condition @xmath735 is automatically satisfied and since the images of @xmath182 and @xmath266 are one - dimensional we obtain the equivalence in ( 2 ) .",
    "+ consider then the case rank @xmath183 , i.e.@xmath184 .",
    "we fist show ( 1 ) in this case .",
    "the images of the polar points are in @xmath274 precisely when @xmath736 and @xmath737 .",
    "note that @xmath738 so the image of @xmath739 _ does not _ contain the polar vectors .",
    "the inverse of @xmath182 is proportional to the matrix @xmath740 and it should therefore map the polar points to ( non - zero ) vectors in the complement of @xmath269 .",
    "this translates into @xmath741 and @xmath742 or equivalently @xmath743 and @xmath744 . to show the last condition we associate to @xmath182 the mbius map @xmath668 which acts upon the riemann sphere @xmath252 . since @xmath745 it follows that @xmath746 maps @xmath747 onto a closed disk in @xmath748 .",
    "we compute its center and radius as follows . for @xmath749",
    ": @xmath750    setting @xmath751 we get : @xmath752    the image of @xmath753 is then the closed disk whose center and radius are given by @xmath754    therefore , @xmath746 maps @xmath536 into the interior of @xmath755 precisely when @xmath756 and since @xmath757 this translates into the stated condition that @xmath758 . + in order to show ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ( recall that here @xmath759 ) we will use a continuity argument .",
    "when @xmath760 and @xmath724 then also @xmath761 .",
    "if we post - compose with @xmath762 , @xmath763 ( which maps @xmath710 into @xmath274 ) then @xmath764 so the product belongs to @xmath715 by ( 1 ) . as @xmath765",
    "we conclude that @xmath766 ( thus showing ( 3 ) ) .",
    "any @xmath766 may be approximated by matrices in @xmath715 so taking closure we get the reverse implication in ( 2 ) .",
    "+    a matrix @xmath717 is a strict contraction of @xmath710 .",
    "in particular the image of any @xmath710 is never the zero vector ( even when @xmath767 ) .",
    "we may therefore associate to such a matrix 4 contraction numbers related to the way the associated linear fractional map contracts the cross - ratio metric .",
    "consider a matrix @xmath717 .",
    "let @xmath746 be the linear fractional map associated to @xmath182 .",
    "we have the following formulae for diameters associated with the matrix :    1 .",
    "@xmath768 2 .",
    "@xmath769 3 .",
    "@xmath770 4 .",
    "@xmath771    the above four quantities of @xmath182 verify :   @xmath772 .",
    "proof : @xmath773 is the logaritm of the largest absolute value of cross - ratio for two points in @xmath670 with respect to two points in @xmath774 .",
    "this is clearly given by @xmath775 with @xmath672 , @xmath673 being the center and the radius , respectively , of the image disk .",
    "inserting formulae from the previous section we get the stated formula .    for @xmath776 note that @xmath489 are boundary points on @xmath536 so the images @xmath685 and @xmath777 are boundary points on the image disk ( see figure ) .",
    "so we must have @xmath778 .",
    "now , map @xmath536 to the unit disk through the map @xmath779 which maps @xmath777 to zero and @xmath685 to @xmath780 .",
    "the maximal cross - ratio between @xmath781 and two points on the boundary of @xmath782 is @xmath783 whence the formula for @xmath784 .    for @xmath785 note that @xmath786 so that @xmath787 which gives the stated formula .",
    "finally @xmath788|=\\log |ad / bc|$ ] .",
    "looking at diameters of smaller subsets yields smaller numbers whence the ordering indicated .",
    "let @xmath789 and @xmath790 .",
    "then the following are equivalent :      proof : assume first that @xmath41 is colinear to @xmath40 , say @xmath794 .",
    "if ( [ p2 ] ) holds , then for @xmath795 , @xmath796 , hence non - zero . since @xmath797 , we must have @xmath798 and ( [ p1 ] ) follows .",
    "conversely , if ( [ p1 ] ) holds , then we can pick @xmath501 for which @xmath799 ( lemma [ m sep ] ) .",
    "then we get @xmath798 .",
    "so for @xmath800 , @xmath801 and @xmath802 .",
    "assume now that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are independent .",
    "suppose first that ( [ p1 ] ) does not hold .",
    "by lemma [ ccones ] , @xmath803 .",
    "so one can pick @xmath804 such that @xmath805 .",
    "one can assume that @xmath806 ( if not , then one has for instance @xmath807 , so @xmath808 , and one can pick @xmath809 so that @xmath810 ; then replace @xmath811 by @xmath812 , @xmath93 small ) .",
    "we define the mbius transformation @xmath813 thus , @xmath746 satisfies the identity @xmath814 .",
    "therefore , @xmath815 note that for @xmath473 , @xmath816 hence @xmath817 .",
    "now , our assumption reduces to @xmath818 . by continuity , for @xmath93 small enough , @xmath819 and ( [ eq - ordre1 ] ) yields @xmath820 .",
    "conversely , assume that one can find @xmath706 , @xmath800 such that @xmath821 .",
    "then one can find as well @xmath804 such that @xmath822 .",
    "again , one can assume that @xmath823 .",
    "let @xmath746 be as above and define @xmath824 .",
    "equation ( [ eq - ordre1 ] ) implies @xmath825 , so that @xmath826 .",
