    "reconciling the vastly different approaches to fluid structure and thermodynamics afforded by classical integral equation ( ie ) formalisms and renormalization group ( rg ) theory , the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt , @xcite ) presents itself as a particularly effective instrument for studying the critical region and liquid - gas phase equilibrium in simple one - component fluids : for subcritical temperatures , @xmath2 , the usual formulation of the theory @xcite yields density intervals of rigorously flat free energy and infinite isothermal compressibility @xmath1 the boundaries of which are readily identified with the densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the coexisting gas and liquid phases .",
    "the binodal so found terminates at some temperature @xmath5 and density @xmath6 in a liquid - gas critical point characterized by non - classical , partly ising - like exponents @xcite . and far away from the coexistence region of the phase diagram",
    ", hrt  reduces to one of the standard approximations of liquid state theory , _ viz .",
    "_ , the popular scheme commonly known under the names of lowest - order @xmath7 ordered approximation ( loga , @xcite ) and optimized random - phase approximation ( orpa , @xcite ) .",
    "hrt s unified treatment of thermodynamic states so diverse should be contrasted with the limitations inherent in approaches based on ies  alone : close to the critical point these generally do not have a solution or else develop major deficiencies , and the binodal is accessible only by way of a maxwell construction @xcite .",
    "rg  calculations alone , on the other hand , while invaluable for illuminating the scaling relations valid asymptotically close to the critical point , generally do not allow one to determine non - universal quantities such as , _",
    "e.  g. _ , the _ loci _ of the critical point and the binodal . a theory like hrt  that provides comprehensive structural and thermodynamic information both close to and away from the critical point and exhibits a non - trivial scaling limit is clearly attractive for applications calling for high - resolution data on the behavior of a fluid in the critical region .",
    "in the present two - part series of reports we want to have a closer look at the solution of the hrt  equations for thermodynamic states of diverging compressibility , _ i.  e. _ , at the critical point and at phase coexistence . our motivation for this inquiry is twofold : first of all , we aim to extend our understanding of the way in which hrt  achieves its remarkable description of criticality and phase separation beyond mere invocation of its conceptual ingredients , rgtheory and thermodynamic consistency ( _ v .",
    "i. _ ) in particular .",
    "instead , it is on the level of the partial differential equation ( pde ) itself and the corresponding finite difference ( fd ) approximations used in practical calculations that we want to understand the mechanism responsible for the suppression of van der waals loops and the emergence of a singular limit of @xmath1 in an extended part of the phase diagram .",
    "a second reason for our investigation lies in our earlier work on hrt  and its numerical side @xcite : for all the merits of the theory , its practical application has been found to be troubled with two major difficulties that have been traced to the customary way of incorporating the core condition of vanishing pair distribution function for hard core reference systems , and to the numerical properties of the equations for high compressibility , respectively .",
    "the latter clearly is an issue of prime importance when focussing on phase separation and the immediate vicinity of the critical point where @xmath1 diverges , and its severity can only be assessed on the basis of a thorough understanding of the numerical process in relation to the properties of the hrt  pde .",
    "evidently , such an understanding is also highly relevant to the interpretation of numerical results and the extraction of meaningful and reliable information from them .    in order to shed some light on these questions , in the present report we study the analytical properties of the pde  in the presence of a singular limit of @xmath1 . relegating some details to the appendix , after a short introduction to hrt  itself and its conceptual basis in section  [ sec : hrtintro ] we present the pde ,",
    "identify a quantity convenient for following the build - up of infinite compressibility , and infer the asymptotic scaling relations we base our work on . employing a suitably formalized notion of smoothness , in sections  [ sec : simplistic ] through  [ sec : stiff ]",
    "we find a total of three scenarios for the gradual build - up of infinite @xmath1 , clarify their respective preconditions , and infer some of their properties with a view to an eventual implementation by fd  methods . according to their most prominent traits we refer to the classes of asymptotic solutions so found as `` ( genuinely ) smooth '' ( section  [ sec : simplistic ] ) , `` monotonous '' ( section  [ sec : monotonous ] ) , and `` stiff '' or only `` effectively smooth '' ( section  [ sec : stiff ] ) , respectively . of these ,",
    "only the first seems to be compatible with an earlier analysis of hrt s scaling limit at first sight @xcite ; however , a closer investigation into the assumptions implicit in the simplifications made there leads to a reappraisal of those results that therefore can not invalidate either of the remaining two candidate types of solution ( section  [ sec : ppr ] ) .    as the considerations outlined above do not take into account the initial and boundary conditions imposed on the pde  but",
    "rather concern themselves with a summary analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the various terms in the pde  and of the range of solution types compatible with these , the all - important question of which of the scenarios captures the true behavior can not be answered in the present contribution . in part  ii  of our investigation @xcite we present a host of numerical evidence strongly suggestive of a pdeasymptotically turning stiff for thermodynamic states of infinite compressibility while fd  methods on practical discretization grids bring about a regularization that leads to an artificially smoothed solution .",
    "assertion of stiffness also paves the way for a qualitative understanding of the relation between specific features of the fourier transform of the potential and its numerical properties , clarifies the special standing of the hard - core yukawa potential , and leads to a detailed and self - consistent perception of the process of solving the equations throughout the domain of the pde .",
    "needless to say , these findings are highly relevant for the interpretation of numerical results and the methods of data analysis to be applied to them , especially when working with non - uniform high - resolution discretization grids .",
    "as a starting point , let us shortly review the concepts underlying hrt  when applied to simple one - component fluids , recalling some of its central notions and establishing the equations we will base our work on ; for a more detailed account of the derivation , its physical justification and relation to both the ie  formalism and rgtheory as well as the modifications necessary for dealing with other physical systems , most notably spin models and fluid mixtures , we refer the reader to refs .",

    "we employ a number of notational conventions summarized in the appendix : most importantly , a tilde indicates fourier transformation , and once a symbol has been introduced we generally omit obvious generic function arguments .",
    "the appendix also serves as a repository for some of the more cumbersome analytical expressions as well as for auxiliary definitions and relations tangential to our reasoning but necessary to make our presentation self - contained .",

    "i.  e. _ , @xmath26 clearly , the reference and target systems with potentials @xmath10 and @xmath19 are obtained in the limits @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . a rather intricate analysis of a resummed perturbation expansion for the properties of the @xmath29 system in terms of those of the @xmath20 system at the same temperature and density in the limit @xmath30 finally yields a non - terminating hierarchy of first - order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in @xmath20 for the free energy @xmath31 and the @xmath32 particle direct correlation functions @xcite .",
    "formally , these differential equations allow one to follow the evolution of structure and thermodynamics of the @xmath20 systems when fluctuations of ever increasing wavelength @xmath33 are taken into account , _ i.  e. _ , when @xmath20 goes from infinity to zero and @xmath34 is transformed from @xmath10 into @xmath19 .",

    "@xcite proposed an alternative formulation in terms of an auxiliary quantity @xmath43 that is essentially the first @xmath20 derivative of the free energy ; just as in our previous work on hrt  @xcite , in the present contribution we rely on a slightly different definition for @xmath0 detailed in the appendix , _ cf . _",

    "in addition , as the coexisting densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 are obtained as the limits of @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath106 , anything but continuous inverse compressibility is hard to accomodate within this picture , which agrees well with the known coincidence of the hrt  binodal and spinodal for space dimensionality @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the key _ rle _  played by the @xmath46 term in stabilizing the solution and locating the densities of the pure phases once more highlights the importance of the thermodynamic consistency condition  ( [ sumrule ] ) underlying the transition from odes  at fixed @xmath9 to a pdeover all of @xmath37 : indeed , it should come as no surprise that application of an approximation incompatible with the afore - mentioned compressibility sum rule yields pathological results including negative compressibility @xcite .    without evidence to the contrary it is then tempting to subscribe to the seemingly natural assumption of a smooth solution , @xmath80",

    "the scenario just discussed differs from genuine smoothness and monotonous growth in two important ways : firstly , the singularity of @xmath0 may be stronger than before as there is now no need for the cancellation required in section  [ sec : simplistic ] , nor does boundedness of the mean of @xmath129 imply boundedness of the mean slope of @xmath0 as in section  [ sec : monotonous ] . secondly , non -",
    "vanishing exponents @xmath78 and @xmath76 mean that the scales characteristic of the variation of @xmath0 and , hence , the grid spacings @xmath82 and @xmath83 appropriate for the discretization of the pde  become arbitrarily small as diverging isothermal compressibility is built up , which obviously has grave repercussions for the applicability of fd  methods to the pde  at hand .",
    "this last point is worth considering in some detail : clearly , for the fd  equations to be a good approximation of the pde  the step sizes must go to zero as appropriate inverse powers of @xmath50 determined by @xmath78 , @xmath76 , and the orders of the local truncation error in @xmath192 and @xmath83 .",
    "excluding a very weak divergence of @xmath0 , however , the rapid growth of @xmath50 certainly renders so fine a grid impractical @xcite , and below some cutoff @xmath193 the numerics can no longer follow the evolution in @xmath20 of the true solution of the pde , nor that in @xmath9 below some @xmath194 . except right at @xmath91 and @xmath92 , both @xmath195",
    "are rather well defined because of the non - zero exponents @xmath196 . below the @xmath195 , the basic assumption underlying any fd  method , _ viz .",
    "_ , applicability of taylor expansions of rather low order , tantamount to smoothness of the solution on the scales set by the discretization grid spacings , no longer holds so that a discretization derived on this basis is used outside its range of validity .",
    "a chosen implementation of the theory may therefore fail to proceed to @xmath197 altogether due to inappropriately large step sizes : in this case no solution is ever obtained at @xmath198 below the critical temperature and neither criticality nor phase separation can be described , just as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix b.1 of ref .",
    "alternatively , judicious choice of the formulation of the theory and of its discretization may allow the numerical scheme to solve the fdequations all the way to vanishing cutoff ; it is this very property of eq .",

    "taylor expansion arguments no longer being applicable , however , _ a priori _ bounds on the local truncation error are not available , and the global error may well be substantial . furthermore ,",
    "as any solution generated in a fd  calculation on a given grid is well represented on that same grid by definition , we can use the same arguments as in section  [ sec : simplistic ] to show that the numerical results obtained with step sizes of order @xmath70 necessarily reproduce vanishing _ effective _ exponents @xmath199 .",
    "this reduction of the exponents from @xmath200 for the exact solution corresponds to a smoothing of @xmath0 that presumably weakens the singularity , _",
    "v.  s. _ , and also suppresses any oscillations on cutoff and density scales smaller than the step sizes .",
    "such smoothing is very well known in the numerics of pdes  and in fact forms the conceptual basis for the highly efficient multi - grid methods for the solution of integral and differential equations @xcite .    in this `` stiff , '' or only `` effectively smooth '' scenario , any results obtained by fd  methods then necessarily realize the genuinely smooth case of section  [ sec : simplistic ] , admitting , _",

    "the artificial smoothing attendant to the reduction of the exponents directly affects the solution for @xmath202 at any cutoff lower than @xmath203 , and the final results for @xmath204 .",
    "given the @xmath46 term of the pde , however , such drastic qualitative ( @xmath205 ) and quantitative ( @xmath206 ) changes inside the region of large @xmath50 must have an effect on the location of the binodal as well as on the solution for the pure phases , too .",
    "restriction of large @xmath0 to only a rather well - defined density interval @xmath100 $ ] , the pde s parabolic character , and the boundary conditions imposed at @xmath207 and @xmath208 nevertheless inspire some hope that the error incurred outside the binodal might be limited . indeed , in the presence of stiffness and smoothing",
    "this very hope must underlie any attempt at a numerical solution of the hrt  equations and certainly has to be justified at least _ a posteriori _ by combining related calculations and testing the internal consistency of the results obtained @xcite .",
    "so far our considerations have led us to the formulation of three different possibilities for the asymptotic behavior of the hrt  pdefor high compressibility states characterized by true smoothness of the solution , by monotonous growth leading to only a logarithmic singularity , and by stiffness giving rise to effective smoothness of @xmath0 , respectively .    at first sight",
    ", however , anything but the genuinely smooth solution , @xmath80 , seems to be at variance with the detailed analysis of hrt s scaling limit in ref .",
