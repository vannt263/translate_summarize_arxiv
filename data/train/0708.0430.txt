    "diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) is defined as ionized gas with a very low density . it is normally localized outside classical hii regions , in the interarm regions of spiral galaxies ( benvenuti et al .",
    "1976 ) , at high altitude over the galactic plane ( rand et al . 1990 ) , and in very low density regions inside the milky way ( reynolds 1983 ) .",
    "the spectral characteristics of this gas ( low excitation and high values of the [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratios ) indicate the existence of extra sources of ionization besides photoionization , such as shocks and turbulence due to stellar winds and other disturbances of the gas .    such a gas can also be observed in irregular galaxies , at the outermost parts ( hunter & gallagher 1992 ) and in the `` inter - hii regions '' ( e.g. hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the dig in the few irregular galaxies studied so far ( hidalgo - gmez 2005 , 2006 ; hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) indicate that the ionization sources are very different from those in spiral galaxies .",
    "the dig of most of these galaxies can be ionized by photon leakage from the hii regions , although the kinematics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is disturbed in some galaxies ( gr 8 ; hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) . only a few of the galaxies studied so far need an extra source of ionization ( e.g. wolf - rayet stars for ic 10 ; hidalgo - gmez 2005 ) .",
    "our goal is to study the influence of the perturbations of the interstellar medium on the ionization of the dig , if any , and whether there is any difference for different metallicities , gas masses , or star formation rates .",
    "as irregular galaxies comprise a large range in these properties , a large sample of them is needed .",
    "ddo 53 is a not - very - well - studied dwarf irregular galaxy of the m81 group , but it has three properties which make it a very good candidate for the study of the dig .",
    "first , it has a high gas content with a total gas mass of @xmath1 @xmath2 ( hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) and a star formation rate of @xmath3 @xmath2 yr@xmath4 .",
    "second , it is located at only @xmath5 mpc ( hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 1998 ) ; therefore , the dig can be detected easily with medium - size telescopes and not very long integration times .",
    "moreover , the spatial resolution is good enough to study the details of the dig and differentiate it from the classical hii regions . finally , h@xmath0 images of the galaxy ( strobel et al .",
    "1990 ) indicate the existence of gas in between the classical hii regions .    a description of the observations and the data reduction procedure is given in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents a brief description of the dig along the slit positions .",
    "the ionization source of the dig is presented in section 4 , while in section 5 a brief discussion on the spectral characteristics of the dig of this galaxy compared with previous galaxies is given , as well as a determination of the metallicity .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "the spectra of ddo 53 were obtained on 2002 march 12 - 14 with the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir .",
    "the boller & chivens spectrograph was used with a 300 line mm@xmath4 grating blazed at 5000  .",
    "the detector was a site3 ccd with 3@xmath6 m pixels in a @xmath7 format .",
    "the slit length was @xmath8 and the width was 170@xmath6 m , subtending @xmath92@xmath10 on the sky , and yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath11  .",
    "the pixel scale along the spatial direction was @xmath12 .",
    "the full spectral range observed was 3500 - 6900  . during the first two nights , strong wind and cirrus made the conditions not very photometric , while the third night the weather conditions improved , although the seeing was higher .",
    "table 1 shows the log of observations .",
    "no correction for differential refraction was performed , as the air masses were , in all cases , smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "the orientation of the slit was east - west with a total of eight slit positions .",
    "the reduction of the data was performed with the midas software package .",
    "bias and sky twilight flat - fields were used for the calibration of the ccd response . due to the strong differences in the sensitivity of the ccd based on the wavelength ,",
    "the spectral range was divided into three parts : from 5200 to 6800    ( red ) , from 4000 to 5600   ( green ) , and from 3500 to 4800    ( blue ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to the low efficiency of the spectrograph at the blue end , no spectral lines were detected there , and the blue end was therefore not used in the present investigation .",
    "he - ar lamps were used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "in addition , the spectra were corrected for geometric deflections .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction using the san pedro mrtir tables ( schuster & parrao 2001 ) .",
    "several standard stars were observed each night in order to perform the flux calibration .",
    "the accuracy of the calibration was higher than 5@xmath14 for all nights .",
    "the most difficult task was the sky subtraction , because removing the strong sky lines of the spectra also removes most of the low surface brightness emission . in order not to remove this emission , only a dozen rows at each edge of the image",
    "were used in the sky templates for each spectrum , although the emission from the galaxy covered only the central part of the slit .",
    "the number of rows , different for each spectrum , was selected as a compromise between the correctness of the results and the maintenance of a low surface brightness emission .",
    "this was done by visual inspection .",
    "the main problem is that the intensity of neither hei at @xmath155875 nor [ oi ] @xmath156300  can be measured because of the proximity of strong sky lines , but these lines are not very commonly seen at low surface brightness .",
    "moreover , sky subtraction which removed all the sky lines , has been performed for other data sets with similar results to those presented here ( see , e.g. hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) . in any case , special care was taken in the analysis of this data .",
    "this set of data , fully reduced and calibrated , was divided into a number of spectra , covering five rows each .",
    "this value matches the seeing conditions during the observations and corresponds to @xmath16 pc at a distance of @xmath5 mpc ( hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 1998 ) .",
    "a total of @xmath17 one - dimensional spectra were studied , covering eight slit positions throughout the galaxy .",
    "these spectra are referred to as the `` 1d spectra '' .",
    "the next step is to correct these spectra for absorption and extinction .",
    "the usual procedure in the absorption correction is to increase the equivalent width of h@xmath18 by 2   ( e.g. mccall et al .",
    "a more accurate absorption correction is to follow olofsson ( 1995 ) , who calculated the absorption equivalent width for each balmer line using different initial mass functions , metallicities , and ages of the star formation event .",
    "all these procedures were optimized for hii regions but not for low surface brightness emission , such as studied here . in order to check whether the absorption corrections proposed could be used in the dig spectrum , we measured other balmer lines in the dig when present , made the correction to them , and checked whether the values obtained matched the theoretical ones .",
    "the most easily detected line after h@xmath0 and h@xmath18 is h@xmath19 .",
    "this line is detected in some of the spectra .",
    "following mccall et al s correction , only one out of nine of the h@xmath19 intensities matched the theoretical one .",
    "the same was true when considering olofsson s correction .",
    "therefore , as there were no clear absorption features present in the spectra studied here , we preferred not to perform any absorption correction .",
    "the same discussion can be made for the extinction correction .",
    "there are two reasons we decided to perform this correction .",
    "first , the wavelength range for most of the line ratios is small enough not to be affected by extinction .",
    "second , one of the goals of the investigation is to study the distribution of the extinction inside the galaxy .",
    "this correction was performed using the extinction coefficient , defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the theoretical balmer decrement at @xmath22 k for case b of recombination , @xmath23 ) is the whitford modified extinction law ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , and @xmath24 is the observed h@xmath0/h@xmath18 ratio .",
    "the intensities of the lines h@xmath18 , [ oiii ] @xmath155007 , h@xmath0 , [ nii ] @xmath156583 , hei @xmath156678 , [ sii ] @xmath156716 , and [ sii ] @xmath156731 were measured when present , as well as the flux in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "all the lines were measured twice , except when the two values differed by more than 50@xmath14 , normally for low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) lines . for these , a third measurement with a different continuum level was obtained in order to find a more reliable value for the intensity . with these lines the ratios [ oiii]/h@xmath18 , [ oiii]/h@xmath0 , [ nii]/h@xmath0 , hei / h@xmath18 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 were obtained .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the uncertainties .",
    "three different sources were considered : the uncertainties in the level of the spectral continuum with respect to the lines , @xmath25 , those introduced by the reduction procedure , ( especially flat - fielding and flux calibrations ) , @xmath26 , uncertainties due to the extinction correction , @xmath27 .",
    "the final uncertainty for each line was determined from @xmath28 these uncertainties were measured for each line ratio at each spectrum in all the positions for each galaxy . with these values",
    "a total uncertainty for each line and each slit position can be determined .",
    "they are given in table 2 .",
    "as mentioned above , we are interested in the study of the spectral characteristics of the dig .",
    "they will be used to understand the ionization source of this gas and the nature of the hii regions .",
    "the best parameter to discriminate between ionized gas inside and outside the hii regions is the density .",
    "unfortunately , density is one of the most difficult parameters to determine from long - slit spectroscopy data .",
    "the main problem is that in the low - density regime the differences in the [ sii]@xmath156717/[sii]@xmath156731 ratio , which is the most common line ratio used in the density determination , between hii regions , with typical densities of @xmath29 @xmath30 , and the dig , with values of @xmath31 @xmath30 , are about @xmath32 ( see figure 5.3 in osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "such a difference is normally smaller than the uncertainties in the ratios themselves . in spiral galaxies",
    "this can be overcome by studying the gas above the disc ( e.g. otte & dettmar 1999 ) or in the inter - arm region ( benvenuti et al .",
    "1976 ) , with neither of them clearly defined for irregular galaxies .",
    "therefore , other parameters have to be used in the study of the dig . in this sense the emission measure ( em ) , related to surface brightness in h@xmath0 and the electronic temperature ( greenawalt et al .",
    "1998 ) , is a good choice . in the milky way",
    "there is a correlation between low em and low density ( r. reynolds 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , the em can be used to discriminate between dig and hii regions when the density can not be determined . the main problem is the lack of a unique value for the em of the dig in spiral galaxies .",
    "it varies from @xmath33 pc @xmath34 in the arms of spiral galaxies ( hoopes & walterbos 2003 ) to @xmath35 pc @xmath34 in the milky way ( reynolds 1989 ) . instead of choosing a value in this range",
    ", we decided to use another approach .",
    "the cumulative distribution function of the surface brightness in h@xmath0 [ hereafter sb(h@xmath0 ) ] is a smoothly increasing function with a change in the slope when hii regions begin to dominate the light .",
    "this break point in sb(h@xmath0 ) can be considered as the limiting value between dig and hii regions .",
    "this procedure has already been used for some galaxies ( ic 10 , hidalgo - gmez 2005 ; ngc 6822 , hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ; gr 8 and eso 245-g05 , hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the cumulative function of sb(h@xmath0 ) obtained from the 1d spectra , and corrected for galactic extinction following schlegel et al .",
    "the break point is located at @xmath36 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath37 arcsec@xmath38 , which corresponds to a flux of @xmath39 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath37 .",
    "this value is very similar to the ones found in gr 8 and eso 245-g05 ( hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) . in their study of the hii regions in ddo 53 , strobel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) set the boundaries of their regions at a flux of @xmath40 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath37 , which is very similar to the value found here .",
    "another break point can be detected at @xmath41 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath37 , arcsec@xmath38 which might be an indication of noise level .",
    "there are only five data points with sb(h@xmath0 ) lower than this limit , and they are not going to be considered in this investigation .    using this sb(h@xmath0 ) from the 1d spectra , we can divide the data points into @xmath42 dig and @xmath43 hii locations .",
    "another @xmath31 spectra have no emission in any line .",
    "in addition to the 1d spectra , we can sum up all the rows with sb(h@xmath0 ) lower ( higher ) than @xmath36 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath37 arcsec@xmath38 in order to create the so - called `` integrated spectra '' for the dig ( hii regions )",
    ". a total of @xmath44 integrated spectra were created : @xmath45 hii regions and @xmath46 dig locations .",
    "the main caveat is that the cumulative function is a statistical approach , and therefore , the distinction between hii regions and dig might be fuzzy , especially at low surface brightness or when the spatial averages of the 1d spectra are large , as in ngc 6822 , where the 1d spectra covered @xmath47 pixels ( see hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 for details ) . in order to test the goodness of this approach , we can study the relation between sb(h@xmath0 ) and the line ratios , particularly the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . as expected",
    ", there is a trend toward low [ sii]/h@xmath0 and high [ oiii]/h@xmath18 as sb(h@xmath0 ) gets larger , with regression coefficients of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the transition between hii and dig locations is very smooth in the log [ oiii ] versus sb(h@xmath0 ) plot , although the dispersion is large .",
    "there are dig locations with high excitation ( @xmath50 ) and hii regions with low excitation ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "two of the latter are located at the border of the hii regions , and therefore , they might share the characteristics of both locations , while another two are small hii regions of only 1d spectra .",
    "finally , the dig with the highest excitation corresponds to slit f , where no hii regions were detected .",
    "the transition in figure  [ fig2]b is also smooth , with a very steep correlation for the dig locations . in any case , these figures indicate that the distinction made in this investigation is reasonable .",
    "once the distinction between the hii regions and the dig locations is clear , the next step is to study some of the characteristics , such as the excitation , the distribution of sb(h@xmath0 ) , and the ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 throughout the galaxy .",
    "this can be performed using the set of 1d spectra previously defined .",
    "each of the 1d spectra covers @xmath16 pc , and therefore , the variations between them for the hii and dig locations can be studied in detail .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the variations of sb(h@xmath0 ) along the slit , from north ( at the top , slit a ) to south ( slit h ) and from west ( to the left ) to east .",
    "all the slit positions have the same sb limits in order to see their differences throughout the galaxy .",
    "those places with sb(h@xmath0 ) higher than @xmath36 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath37 arcsec@xmath38 ( hii regions ) are contained between dot - dashed lines .",
    "the most extended hii regions are located at slits b , c and d , with sizes of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath52 pc , respectively . as we move towards the south the hii regions get smaller and",
    "the dig is more extended .",
    "in fact , in one slit position ( f ) there are no hii regions . when compared with an h@xmath0 image ( e.g. figs .",
    "2_a _ and 2_b _ in strobel et al . 1990 ) , the similarities are clear .",
    "the largest hii regions are located in the north of the galaxy , while towards the south , only small clumps of high intensity are found with a lot of ionized gas among them .",
    "the regions in this investigation can be identified as regions no @xmath45 ( slit a ) , no @xmath31 at slit b , no @xmath43 at slits c and d , no @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( e ) , no @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( g ) and no @xmath46 at slit h in strobel et al .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that the slit positions are not next to each other , with spatial gaps between the slits .",
    "moreover , the slits were offset towards the west when moving from north to south following the orientation of the galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are no abrupt changes in sb(h@xmath0 ) from the hii regions towards the dig , as in ngc 6822 ( see fig . 3 in hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio along the slits is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the orientation and the meaning of the lines are the same as in figure  [ fig3 ] . along with the hii regions , the values from the integrated spectra",
    "are shown as dotted lines .",
    "no uncertainties are shown for the sake of clarity . also , the limits in all the slit positions are the same in order to see any differences among them .",
    "the largest value of the excitation of @xmath58 is at slit h , corresponding to region no @xmath46 , while slits b , c and d show [ oiii]/h@xmath18 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "they coincide with the largest and brightest hii regions of the galaxy .",
    "the largest value of the excitation is normally coincident with the largest sb except for slit e , where the maximum excitation is at the border of one of the hii regions .",
    "moreover , the excitation inside the hii regions of slit e is very low ( @xmath61 in both cases ) and very similar to the values outside them . on the contrary",
    ", the excitation is very high ( @xmath62 ) for most of the dig locations of slit f. both slit g and h are normal , with the highest excitation inside the hii regions and a low value of the excitation outside them , in general . concerning the dig , it is well known that the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio is lower than @xmath63 in the dig of spiral galaxies ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "this is not the situation here , since most of the values of this ratio are larger than @xmath63 at the dig .",
    "in fact , three of the 1d spectra of slit f , where no proper hii regions are , have [ oiii]/h@xmath18 larger than @xmath35 .",
    "such large values of this ratio for dig locations have been measured in other dwarf irregular galaxies , such as ic 10 ( hidalgo - gmez 2005 ) , ngc 6822 ( hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) , and eso 245-g05 ( hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) .",
    "another interesting fact to note is that only for slits b , c , g , and h is this ratio larger inside the hii regions than in the dig locations , as expected . for the rest of the slits ( a , d , and e ) , the value of the ratio in the dig is smaller than or of the same order as inside the hii regions .",
    "for all of them , the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio from the 1d spectra agrees with the values from the integrated spectra when the uncertainties are considered .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio along the slit positions .",
    "the orientation and the meaning of the lines are the same as in figure  [ fig3 ] , and the values are between @xmath64 and @xmath65 for all slit positions .",
    "again , the average values are shown as dotted lines , when determined . in previous studies",
    "an important difference in this ratio between the dig and the hii locations has been detected for both spiral ( ngc 55 ; otte & dettmar 1999 ) and irregular galaxies ( ngc 6822 ; hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) .",
    "it is very interesting to note that , in general , there is no such difference here , either in the integrated spectra or in the 1d ones , with similar values of the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio in the dig and inside the hii regions ( e.g. slits a , c and d ) . for those slit positions where the differences are larger , they are not as large as in other irregular galaxies , such as ngc 6822 ( hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , a very large value of this ratio is detected inside the hii region gh2 for both the 1d spectra and the integrated ones , which is quite unexpected .",
    "moreover , sulfur lines were not detected at any locations along slit b but , due to the larger s / n , a value is obtained from the average spectrum . on the contrary ,",
    "[ sii]/h@xmath0 is measurable in two of the 1d spectra of slit h , but no value could be obtained for the average spectrum because the number of 1d spectra where this line is not detected was larger than the number of locations where it is detected . in this case , the noise from the non detections is larger than the signal .",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is important because it might be a shock indicator ( dopita 1993 ) . for low metallicities , intensities larger than @xmath66",
    "indicate the existence of shocks ( stasiska 1990 ) when the excitation is low .",
    "such large values are not observed except for a total of four 1d spectra in slits e , f and g , and none of them has a high excitation as well .",
    "three of them are located in the eastern part of the galaxy .",
    "begum et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in their study of the interstellar medium of this galaxy , obtained velocity maps .",
    "they found out that the velocity gradient towards the south eastern part of the galaxy , which is receding from us , is larger than that in the northern approaching half of the galaxy . apart from this",
    ", there is nothing else peculiar in the hi and velocity maps .",
    "an increment in the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio towards the south is clearly seen in figure  [ fig6 ] , which might resemble the increase in the velocity gradient . in this sense , the lack of this ratio in the southernmost slit position , h , is even more intriguing . from this information",
    "it can be advanced that shock might not be important as an ionization source , as we discuss in section 4 , in spite of the disturbed kinematics of the galaxy ( begum et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratio is not shown here due to the small number of 1d spectra where nitrogen was detected .",
    "therefore , few conclusions could be obtained from this distribution .",
    "the few points detected in the northern slits have very low values of this ratio , while they increase when moving towards the south , with ratios of @xmath66 at slit e.    finally , figure  [ fig7 ] shows the extinction along the slits .",
    "it is parametrized with the extinction coefficient defined as in section 2 .",
    "the values are corrected for galactic extinction following schlegel et al .",
    "ddo 53 shows an irregular extinction distribution , not only along the slits but also between them .",
    "there are slits where the extinction seems to be very homogeneous ( e.g. a - d ) , while slits e - h show ( extended ) clumps of it , as can be seen in the h@xmath0 image from strobel et al .",
    "this might resemble the fact that at this part of the galaxy the hii regions also have small sizes , while at the northern part the hii regions have larger sizes .",
    "this behaviour is very similar to that of other galaxies , such as gr 8 ( hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) . as in ic 10 ( hidalgo - gmez 2005 ) and",
    "gr 8 ( hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) , the larger extinction is not associated with the hii regions and vice versa .",
    "the maxima are located at e6 and f6 with values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "they are not associated with the two clumps observed in hi ( begum et al .",
    "2006 ) , and they are mainly coincident with the northern regions , no @xmath45 and no @xmath31 , and the south eastern ones no @xmath46 and @xmath69 . in any case , it is interesting to note that most of the values of @xmath70 are larger than @xmath63 .",
    "this is contrary to the idea that dwarf galaxies are almost dust - free ( lee et al . 2003 ) and in agreement with the conclusions from high spatial resolution investigations carried out in the small magellanic cloud by caplan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "as previously said , in addition to the 1d spectra , average spectra were obtained for each slit position . for them ,",
    "the lines [ oiii ] @xmath155007 and [ sii ] @xmath156717 , as well as h@xmath18 and h@xmath0 , were measured . in table 3 , along with the line ratios [ oiii]/h@xmath18 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 , the extinction coefficient @xmath70 and the s / n in h@xmath0 for the integrated spectra are shown . also , in order to make a quick comparison with models , the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio is presented .",
    "[ nii ] @xmath156583 was detected in only bh1 , while hei @xmath156678 was detected in bh1 and ch1 , but the values are not presented in the table .",
    "the dig results obtained from the integrated spectra are very similar to those from the 1d spectra : large values of the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio , low values of [ sii]/h@xmath0 , and large extinction . concerning the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio , half of the dig locations have values lower than @xmath63 , but none of them have values lower than @xmath65 , which is the highest value measured at the dig in spiral galaxies ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "the differences in the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio between irregular galaxies and the extraplanar dig in spiral galaxies indicate higher oxygen abundances in irregular galaxies or harder spectra .",
    "most of the low excitation values in ddo 53 correspond to the southern slits ( e - g ) . on the contrary , for the northern slits half of the dig locations",
    "have values of [ oiii]/@xmath71 larger than @xmath72",
    ". we have to keep in mind that these slits pass through the most luminous hii regions of the galaxy , regions no @xmath31 and @xmath43 ( strobel et al . 1990 ) .",
    "such large values of the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio are also measured for the dig of other irregular galaxies , such as ic 10 ( hidalgo - gmez 2005 ) .",
    "if the absorption - corrected ratios are considered , the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio is lower : in general , @xmath73 lower than the values presented in table 3 .    we also present the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "as previously said , this ratio is given because it is widely used in modelling , despite its strong dependence on extinction .",
    "therefore , the values presented here should be taken with care .",
    "it has been observed that this ratio gets larger with the distance from the galactic plane ( otte et al .",
    "2002 ) , with values larger than @xmath66 outside the hii regions .",
    "values larger than these are observed here for almost all dig locations and hii regions .",
    "if no extinction correction is made , the values are even larger .",
    "also , there are no significant changes ( [ oiii]/h@xmath0 lower then @xmath66 ) if any of the absorption corrections discussed in section 2 are performed .",
    "there are a few things to be noted in relation to the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio from table 3 .",
    "first , the values inside and outside the hii regions are very similar , as noted for the 1d spectra , and to the contrary of what was found for other galaxies ( e.g. ngc 6822 ; hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) .",
    "second , the values increase towards the south ( the receding , disturbed part of the galaxy ) , with a maximum at gh2 , which is an hii region .",
    "eight out of nine integrated spectra where sulfur is detected in the southern region have [ sii]/h@xmath0 larger than @xmath32 , as compared to only @xmath60 out of @xmath31 in the northern region of ddo 53 .",
    "the larger gradient of the velocity towards the south of the galaxy ( begum et al .",
    "2006 ) might be an indication of a disturbance , which might create a shock wave . as for higher velocities of the gas the shocks are more important , and",
    "this ratio will be larger .",
    "these results confirm the trend observed in the 1d spectra .",
    "an average value of @xmath74 could be obtained for the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio considering all the dig integrated values .",
    "this is the second lowest value of this ratio for the sample of galaxies already studied , slightly lower than for eso 245-g05 and gr 8 ( @xmath75 ) and much lower than for ic 10 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the low value of the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio might indicate that although the interstellar medium is disturbe d , there is no evidence for shocks ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "again , when the absorption - corrected ratios are used instead , the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is , on average , @xmath77 lower than those discussed here , but the general trend remains .",
    "finally , the extinction also follows the same trend that was observed in the 1d spectra .",
    "ddo 53 has a significant amount of dust .",
    "there are locations with @xmath70 larger than @xmath35 , and there is no systematic trend of the hii regions being dustier than the dig or vice versa .",
    "it is important to note that the southern regions seem to be dustier than the northern ones .",
    "in order to determine the ionization source of the dig , a comparison can be made between the line ratios measured in this galaxy and the values predicted by different models .",
    "considering radiation - bounded hii regions , mathis ( 1986 ) and domgrgen & mathis ( 1994 ) obtained that the value of both [ sii]/h@xmath0 and [ nii]/h@xmath0 for the dig are very large , larger than @xmath66 , while [ oiii]/h@xmath0 is lower than @xmath32 .",
    "the main caveat is that these results are optimized for milky way metallicities .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the metallicity of ddo 53 is much lower than the milky way s .",
    "castellanos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) tried to reproduce the line ratios of the dig for low - metallicity galaxies using the photoionization code cloudy .",
    "they successfully reproduced the increase of both [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 , but they did not fit the excitation , [ oiii]/h@xmath18 .",
    "wood & mathis ( 2004 ) performed monte carlo simulations of a multicomponent interstellar medium with different ionizing spectra and metallicities in order to explain the increase of the [ nii]/[sii ] ratio with the distance from the plane .",
    "they fit this ratio but not others , such as [ oiii]/h@xmath0 . comparing the value listed in table 3 with the results from mathis ( 1986 ) and domgrgen & mathis ( 1994 )",
    ", it can be concluded that the hii regions in ddo 53 are not radiation - bounded because [ oiii]/h@xmath0 is never as low as @xmath32 , and [ sii]/h@xmath0 never as high as @xmath66 except in gh2 . actually , the lowest [ oiii]/h@xmath0 value is @xmath78 ( ed2 and ed3 ) .    in recent years",
    "density - bounded hii regions have been modelled ( wood & mathis 2004 ; hoopes & walterbos 2003 ) , but again for high - metallicity regions .",
    "therefore , some corrections have to be made .",
    "the real corrections can not be done , but one knows that lower metallicities imply a high ionization parameter , which implies higher [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratios .",
    "therefore , the lower the metallicity , the higher the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio for similar t@xmath79 . as a consequence ,",
    "the photon leakage obtained from the models might be larger than the real leakage , or t@xmath79 lower than the real value .",
    "we compare the values listed in table 3 with those from the hoopes & walterbos ( 2003 ) model .",
    "this model is preferred because wood & mathis ( 2004 ) focus on explaining the rising relation between log [ nii]/h@xmath0 and log [ sii]/h@xmath0 for the dig .",
    "[ nii ] is not detected except in a few regions of the dig in ddo 53 , and such a relationship can not be studied .",
    "table 4 shows the leakage of photons from the hii regions needed for each of the line ratios measured for the integrated dig spectra from the hoopes & walterbos models .",
    "the corresponding ionization temperatures are also listed .",
    "first , we can study the results from the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "ionization temperatures lower than @xmath80 k and photon leakages lower than @xmath77 are obtained from them in all the locations where it was detected but two ( gd3 and fd1 ) . on the contrary , the t@xmath79 values which fit the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratios are always higher than @xmath81 k. photon leakages larger than @xmath77 are the most common value . considering that the metallicity of ddo 53 is lower than the metallicity of orion , for which the model is calculated ( see section 5.1 ) , the values for the [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio might be upper limits .",
    "therefore , considering the uncertainties of the ratios and the difference in metallicity , a t@xmath79 between @xmath81 and @xmath82 k fits very well both ratios for all slit positions .",
    "also , values of photon leakages between @xmath83 and @xmath73 can account for both ratios in all slits but gd2 , where larger leakage is needed .",
    "moreover , all slits but a and b show a good agreement in t@xmath79 between all the dig locations inside the slit .",
    "the photon leakage range is broader , and therefore more difficult to be fitted by a single value .",
    "these ionization temperatures seem quite realistic , as can be seen from figure  [ fig8 ] , where the log  [ sii]/h@xmath0 versus log  [ oiii]/h@xmath18 diagram is shown . superimposed on the data points ( both hii regions and dig locations ) are tracks of ionization temperature from figure 3 in martin ( 1997 ) .",
    "the tracks indicate the temperatures needed to ionize the medium only by photoionization for a metallicity of @xmath78 ( o / h)@xmath84 .",
    "these are @xmath85 k ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 k ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "most of the dig data points have t@xmath79 between @xmath87 and @xmath89 k while one dig locations have t@xmath79 higher than @xmath89 k ( fd1 ) and three of them have ionization temperatures lower than @xmath87 k ( bd2 , gd1 , and ed2 ) .",
    "location fd1 has a very large excitation , and therefore , it is located in that position in the diagram .",
    "moreover , two hii regions ( gh2 and eh1 ) have extreme ionization temperatures , larger than @xmath85 k and lower than @xmath87 k , respectively .",
    "such values are very unlikely for normal hii regions . their excitations are normal as compared to the values of the other hii regions , but they have the highest and the lowest [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratios ( see table 3 ) , and therefore , they occupy these positions in the log  [ sii]/h@xmath0 versus log  [ oiii]/h@xmath18 diagram . from figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "it is also interesting to note that there is no real difference in the ionization temperatures between hii regions and dig locations .",
    "it can be concluded that most of the locations agree with t@xmath79 values between @xmath87 and @xmath82 k and photon leakages between @xmath83 and @xmath73 .",
    "the uniformity of these values is very interesting , indicating similar conditions throughout the galaxy .",
    "there can not be a single value for the whole galaxy , as physical conditions vary throughout it .",
    "moreover , they are independent of absorption correction , in the sense that the same values are obtained for the t@xmath79 and leakage percentages when the absorption - corrected ratios are considered . with these values , and following vacca et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the stars responsible for the ionization are of types o7-o9 , with masses between 20 and 30 @xmath90 .      as we said before ,",
    "photon leakages from hii regions seem to be the main ionization source of the dig in ddo 53 . in any case",
    ", it might be interesting to look for other ionization sources .",
    "turbulent mixing layers ( tmls ) are good candidates in the sense that the low - ionization lines , such as [ sii ] @xmath156717 , are the most affected by such mechanisms .",
    "shear flows at the boundaries of hot and cold gas produce intermediate - temperature gas ( t @xmath9 10@xmath91 ) that radiates strongly in the optical , ultraviolet , and extreme - ultraviolet . by including the effects of non - equilibrium ionization and self - photoionization of the gas as it cools after mixing",
    ", the intensity of some lines in the optical , infrared , and ultraviolet can be predicted . in figure  [ fig9 ]",
    "we have plotted the data points for ddo 53 along with the tml model by slavin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) as a dashed line , the radiation - bounded model ( @xmath92 ) , and the density - bounded model ( @xmath93 ) from rand ( 1998 ) .",
    "the dispersion is large , especially when hii regions are considered , but it can be concluded that tml is not playing a part in ddo 53 , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to see that all the data points are between the density - bounded and the radiation - bounded lines , as expected .",
    "the slope of the dig data points ( -@xmath94 ) is closer to the slope of the density - bounded model ( -@xmath95 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the slope of the hii regions is very different ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "in addition , it can be seen that most of the data points agree with an ionization factor of @xmath97 , in agreement with the value we used in the hoopes & walterbos model of @xmath98 [ @xmath99 is related to the ionization parameter as @xmath100 according to hoopes & walterbos ( 2003 ) ] .",
    "finally , it might be interesting to explore the existence of shock waves , which might have some influence on the ionization .",
    "as previously said , the interstellar medium of this galaxy seems to be quite disturbed , with a gradient in the velocity increasing towards the south .",
    "such disturbances might create shock waves which can be amplified along the galaxy .",
    "as we previously discussed , there is only one location where the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is larger than @xmath66 ( 7h1 ) . in any case ,",
    "the best way to check the existence of shocks is the diagnostic diagram log[sii]/h@xmath0 versus log[oiii]/h@xmath18 ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows both the dig and hii region data points .",
    "to the left of the solid line there is the photoionized region , and to the right the shocked region .",
    "only one hii region ( gh2 ) is in this latter part of the diagram .",
    "the rest of the locations are in the photoionization region .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that shocks are not important in this galaxy despite the disturbances of the interstellar medium .",
    "from the discussion in the previous section it is obvious that leakage photons from the hii regions are the main cause of the ionization of the dig in ddo 53 .",
    "the values of the leakage are between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which are similar to those in other dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "no other ionization sources ( shock waves , mixing layers , etc ) seem to be at work in this galaxy .",
    "we can compare the line ratios obtained in ddo 53 with those from other galaxies studied so far .",
    "the dig [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is very similar in all the galaxies , with values of @xmath103-@xmath104 except ic 10 ( @xmath76 ; hidalgo - gmez 2005 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the dig excitation changes a lot from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the larger value corresponds to ic 10 ( @xmath105 ) , but both ngc 6822 and ddo 53 have values very similar to this one .",
    "the lowest excitation corresponds to eso 245-g05 ( @xmath106 ; hidalgo - gmez 2006 ) .",
    "these high values of the excitation can be due to differences in the oxygen content or in the ionizing spectra .",
    "ddo 53 has a very similar oxygen content to eso 245-g05 of 12+log(o / h ) = @xmath107 , but their [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratios are very different .",
    "as we said , the value in ddo 53 is similar to those in ngc 6822 and ic 10 , which are much more metallic .",
    "therefore , differences in the metallicity can not account for the differences in excitation",
    ". a harder spectrum might indicate more massive , hotter stars . as a consequence",
    ", the hii regions might be larger and more luminous .",
    "strobel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) concluded that the value of the slope of the luminosity function in h@xmath0 is similar to those found in other irregular galaxies , such as ngc 6822 , ic 10 , and gr 8 .",
    "they reached a similar conclusion on the sizes of the hii regions .",
    "these four galaxies have very similar values of the dig [ oiii]/h@xmath18 ratio , indicating that their ionizing spectra are very similar .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the excitation values at the dig are more closely related to the ionizing spectra than to the oxygen content .",
    "in addition to the study of the dig we can determine the chemical abundances in ddo 53 from the intensities of the integrated hii spectra . the main caveat is the low efficiency of the boller&chives spectrograph below @xmath108  . as mentioned previously",
    ", it is less than @xmath109 . therefore , although the intensities of the lines below @xmath108    could be detected , the values might not be very realistic .",
    "for example , the corrected intensity of the [ oii]/h@xmath18 ratio of region ch1 is 0.20 , which is very low when compared with the values in other hii regions in dwarf irregular galaxies ( see hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain more reliable intensities of the [ oii ] lines , equation ( 1 ) in hidalgo - gmez & ramirez - fuentes ( 2007 ) is used .",
    "this equation relates the intensities of [ oii]@xmath153727 and [ oiii]@xmath155007 .",
    "the reliability and uncertainties of this equation are discussed in hidalgo - gmez & ramirez - fuentes ( 2007 ) . in this case",
    ", we feel that the values obtained from this equation are more trustworthy than those measured in the spectra , and these will be the values used in the determination of the chemical abundances presented here .    in two of these hii integrated spectra , the forbidden oxygen line [ oiii ] @xmath154363 is present , so we can obtain a reliable determination of the electron temperature and the chemical abundances following the so - called standard method ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "these two spectra are regions @xmath110 and @xmath111 in table 2 , which correspond to regions no @xmath31 and no @xmath43 in strobel et al .",
    "the intensities of all the lines measured , extinction - and absorption - corrected , are given in table 5 , along with their uncertainties .",
    "the determined oxygen and nitrogen abundances for regions no 10 and no 13 are presented in table 6 , along with the electronic temperature of the o@xmath112 ( inner ) and the n@xmath113 ( outer ) zones .",
    "the oxygen abundances obtained here of @xmath114 and @xmath115 agree with the values of = @xmath107 obtained with semiempirical methods ( i. saviane 2004 , private communication ) , but they are slightly higher than the previous values obtained for this galaxy of @xmath116 ( skillman et al .",
    "1989 ) . in any case ,",
    "ddo 53 is a low - metallicity galaxy .",
    "it is confirmed by the low nitrogen abundance of 12+log(n / h ) = @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , nitrogen is not detected in region no 13 .",
    "none of the previous determinations of the abundances of ddo 53 measured nitrogen ; therefore , a comparison can not be made .",
    "this value is even lower than for ddo 190 [ 12+log(n / h ) = @xmath118 ; hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 2002 ] which is the galaxy with the lowest nitrogen abundance in a sample of dwarf irregular galaxies . moreover ,",
    "the log(n / o ) ratio is also very low , only @xmath119 , which is very much lower than the canonical @xmath120 obtained for a sample of blue compact and irregular galaxies ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "these low nitrogen abundances might explain the lack of this line in the majority of the hii regions and dig locations .",
    "such low values of nitrogen have been observed in other dwarf irregular galaxies , such as gr 8 [ log(n / o ) = -1.77 ; moles et al .",
    "1990 ] .",
    "finally , we can also determine the helium abundance .",
    "only one line is used ( hei at 6678  ) , because the intensities of other lines can be polluted by sky lines ( hei at 5578  ) or by processes other than pure recombination ( hei at 4471  ; izotov & thuan 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , as the most reliable ionization correction factor is based on the intensity of [ siii ] lines , which are not present in our spectra , the he@xmath121/h@xmath121 ratio is given .",
    "the values of both regions no 10 and no 13 are equal to @xmath122 , very similar to that of other galaxies of the same type ( hidalgo - gmez 1999 ) .",
    "the abundances of these three elements follow a similar pattern to those of ddo 190 , with very low nitrogen and low oxygen but normal helium values ( see table 3 in hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 2002 ) .",
    "another interesting problem is the ( in)homogeneity of the chemical abundances in dwarf irregular galaxies . only in three galaxies",
    "have enhancements of oxygen ( ic 4662 and eso 245-g05 ; hidalgo - gmez et al .",
    "2001 ) or nitrogen ( ngc 5253 ; kobulnicky et al .",
    "1997 ) been reported .",
    "we might use the values presented here to study the oxygen distribution along ddo 53 .",
    "regions no 10 and no 13 are quite close to each other , and their oxygen and helium abundances are similar considering the uncertainties . in other to enlarge the number of oxygen determinations",
    "we can use the other seven hii regions defined in section 3.1 .",
    "again , the [ oii]@xmath153727 intensity can be obtained from equation ( 1 ) in hidalgo - gmez & ramrez - fuentes ( 2007 ) . with the intensities , reddening - corrected and normalized to h@xmath18 , of [ oii]@xmath153727 , [ oiii]@xmath154959 , and [ oiii]@xmath155007 , any of the semiempirical methods , the @xmath123 ( pagel et al .",
    "1979 ) or the @xmath124 method ( pilyugin 2000 , 2001 ) , can be used to determine the oxygen abundance .",
    "the values are shown in table 7 along with the uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties take into account the intrinsic uncertainties of the methods themselves due to their statistical nature .",
    "such uncertainties might be @xmath125 dex according to hidalgo - gmez & ramrez - fuentes ( 2007 ) .",
    "considering all the uncertainties , the oxygen abundances reported in table 7 should be considered as a first approximation only . in consequence",
    ", few conclusions can be obtained .",
    "first , ddo 53 seems to be a low metallicity galaxy .",
    "but at the center of the galaxy , the metallicity seems to be even lower ( regions no 5 , no 6 , and no 11 ) than in the rest of the hii regions , the difference being @xmath126 dex , much larger than the uncertainties . in order to clarify this point , new measurements with good resolution and high",
    "s / n ranging from [ oii ] @xmath153727 to [ sii ] @xmath1276717 , 6731 are needed in order to get a better determination of the abundances throughout the galaxy .",
    "such observations would throw light on this situation .",
    "we studied the line ratios of the dig in the dwarf irregular galaxy ddo 53 using long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the dig values were compared with those of the hii regions . in order to do this comparison ,",
    "definitions of hii regions and the dig were made based on the flux of the h@xmath0 line . with this definition",
    "we divided the data into @xmath45 hii regions and 17 dig locations .",
    "the differences in the line ratios among them are less extreme than for other dwarf irregular galaxies studied before , such as ngc 6822 ( hidalgo - gmez & peimbert 2007 ) and ic 10 ( hidalgo - gmez 2005 ) .",
    "the excitation is as large in this galaxy , especially at the dig location , as in other galaxies , indicating similar ionizing spectra . on the contrary ,",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is lower than in the previously studied galaxies .",
    "[ nii ] @xmath156583 is detected in very few locations along the slits and is not studied here .",
    "in addition to the line ratios , the extinction is studied along the slit positions , indicating that the dust inside the northern part of the galaxy is more homogeneously distributed than in the southen part , where large clumps of dust are clearly detected .",
    "the line ratios obtained are consistent with density - bounded hii regions with a photon leakage of @xmath83 -@xmath73 and ionization temperatures between @xmath87 and @xmath89 k for most of the locations .",
    "no other sources of ionization ( shocks , turbulence , etc , ) are needed in order to explain the line ratios observed in spite of the disturbed kinematics of the galaxy in hi ( begum et al .",
    "2006 ) .    finally , we determined the abundances for two hii regions using the electron temperature method .",
    "the values are very similar and indicate that this is a low - metallicity galaxy . when semiempirical methods are used to determine the oxygen abundances for a large number of hii regions , a difference towards the center of the galaxy is obtained , indicating possible inhomogeneities in the oxygen content . in any case ,",
