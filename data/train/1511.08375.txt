    "discrete element methods are widely employed to model fluid flows in air channels , pipes and several other applications , such as modeling ink - jet printing processes , electrospinning , spray jets , micro - fluid dynamics in nozzles , etc . @xcite . in particular , unidimensional jets can be easily modeled as a sequence of discrete elements by defining a mesh of points , which is used to discretize a continuous object ( e.g. a liquid body ) as a finite sequence of discrete elements . the aim of such model is to provide a relatively simple computational framework based on particle - like ordinary differential equations , rather than on the discretization of the partial differential equations of continuum fluids .",
    "electro - hydrodynamic flows , however , are often subject to strong interactions leading to major deformation of the jet , hence to significant heterogeneities in the spatial distribution of the discrete particle . the latter , in turn , imply a loss of accuracy of the numerical method , since the most stretched portions of the jet become highly under - resolved .",
    "one of these cases is the electrospinning process , where a polymeric liquid jet is ejected from a nozzle and accelerated towards a conductive collector by a strong electric field . in this framework ,",
    "the jet is stretched so that its diameter decreases below the micrometer - scale , providing a one - dimensional structure with very high surface area to volume ratio .",
    "this intriguing feature of the resulting polymer nanofibers spawned several papers @xcite and books @xcite focussing on the electrospinning process .    in this framework , pioneering works by the reneker and yarin groups were focused on developing _ ad - hoc _ discrete element methods for electrospinning , which describe nanofibers as a series of beads obeying the equations of newtonian mechanics @xcite .",
    "this modeling approach has gained an important role in predicting the outcome of electrospinning experiments .",
    "in addition , such models might support experimental researchers with a likely starting point for calibrating processes in order to save time before subsequent optimization work .    in these models ,",
    "the excess charge is distributed to each element composing the jet representation , and it is static in the frame of reference of the extruded fluid jet .",
    "once the solution surface tension is overcome by electrical forces at the spinneret , the jet serves as fluid medium to push away the mutually repulsing electric charges from the droplet pending at the nozzle of the apparatus .",
    "the main forces affecting the jet dynamics , which are accounted for in such models , include viscoelasticity , surface tension and electrostatic interactions with the external field and among excess charges in the liquid .",
    "in particular , the coulomb repulsion between electric charges triggers bending instabilities in electrically charged jets , as demonstrated by reneker et al . @xcite . despite being often neglected",
    ", air drag and aerodynamic effects , which may also lead to bending instabilities , have been recently modeled by discrete element methods @xcite .",
    "further , several complex viscoelastic models were included in order to simulate viscoelastic boger fluid solutions @xcite .",
    "systematic investigations were carried out on several simulations parameters : polymer concentration , solution density , electric potential , and perturbation frequency @xcite .    notwithstanding a satisfactory , though generally qualitative ,",
    "agreement with experimental results has been shown @xcite , all these methods suffer the non - constant resolution of the jet representation , which usually decreases downstream .",
    "indeed , given a uniform discretization of the initial polymeric drop pending at the nozzle , the initial step of the jet dynamics is characterized by the prevalent viscoelastic force , and it leads to a second regime , when the longitudinal stress changes under the effect of the applied electric voltage , accelerating the jet towards the collector @xcite .",
    "hence , a free - fall regime describes the later jet dynamics .",
    "since the longitudinal viscoelastic stress along the fiber is usually larger close to the nozzle , the distance between each discrete element increases as a result of the uniformly accelerated motion , which drives the farthest elements from the spinneret . as a consequence ,",
    "the jet discretization close the collector becomes rather coarse to model efficiently the filament , and the information ( position , velocity , radius , stress , etc . ) describing the jet is lost downstream .",
    "a refined description of jet is necessary in every instance where a high - resolution description of physical quantities is requested , such as for bending instabilities , varicose instabilities of diameter , etc .",
    "further , a dense mesh provides a more strict assessment of the coulomb repulsion term , which is important to properly account the transverse force acting on the jet .",
    "recently , refinement procedures were proposed in few works in order to avoid low resolution problems downstream @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these procedures exploit only linear interpolations , and are not able to impose a uniform mesh of jet representation , which is likely the simplest choice to model properly the entire jet , from the nozzle to the collector .    here",
    ", we present an algorithm specifically developed to address the issue .",
    "the aim of the algorithm is to recover a finer jet representation at constant time interval , before the information describing the jet is scattered downstream , so as to preserve the jet modeling representation and make the simulation more realistic .",
    "further , the algorithm can be used to enforce several types of mesh depending on the physical quantities under investigation , providing an adaptive description of the process .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we summarize the 3d model for electrospinning , with the set of equations of motion ( eom ) which govern the dynamics of system . in sec .",
    "3 , we present the algorithm , with the relative step for its implementation . in sec .",
    "4 we report a numerical example of its application within a discrete element method for electrospinning modeling . finally , conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "in this work , we apply our algorithm to the electrospinning model implemented in jetspin , an open - source code specifically developed for electrospinning simulation @xcite , which is briefly summarized in the following text .",
    "the model is an extension of the discrete model originally introduced by reneker et al . @xcite .",
    "the main assumption of such model is that the filament can be reasonable represented by a series of @xmath0 discrete elements ( jet beads ) .",
    "each one of this elements is a particle - like labelled by an index @xmath1 .",
    "a cartesian coordinate system is taken so that the origin is located at the nozzle , and @xmath2 is pointing perpendicularly towards a collector where the nanofiber is deposited .",
    "the nozzle is also represented as a particle like ( nozzle bead ) which can moves on the plane @xmath3 ( further details in the following text ) .",
    "given a fluid jet starting at the nozzle and labeling @xmath4 the nozzle bead , we obtain the set of beads indexed @xmath5 , where @xmath0 denotes the bead of the other extremity of the filament .",
    "thus , given @xmath6 the position vector of a generic @xmath1 bead , we define the mutual distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 elements @xmath9 here , @xmath10 stands for the length step used for discretizing the filament .",
    "note that the length @xmath11 is typically larger than the filament radius , but smaller than the characteristic lengths of other observables of interest ( e.g. jet curvature radius ) . denoted @xmath12 the mass , @xmath13 the time , and @xmath14 the velocity vector of @xmath1 bead , its acceleration is given by newton s law @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total force acting on @xmath1 bead , given as a sum of several terms @xmath17    in last eq , @xmath18 stands for the electric force due to the external electrical potential @xmath19 imposed between the nozzle and the collector located at distance @xmath20 along versor @xmath21 , and given as @xmath22 denoted @xmath23 the charge of @xmath1 bead , the net coulomb force @xmath24 is @xmath25 acting on the @xmath1 bead and originated from all the other @xmath26 beads .",
    "further , we denote @xmath27 the surface tension force @xmath28 acting on @xmath1 bead towards the center of the local curvature ( according to @xmath29 versor ) to restore the rectilinear shape of the jet , given @xmath30 the surface tension coefficient , @xmath31 the jet radius , and @xmath32 the local curvature ( measured at @xmath1 bead ) . finally , @xmath33 stands for the viscoelastic force @xmath34 pulling bead @xmath7 back to @xmath35 and towards @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the stress and @xmath38 the unit vector pointing bead @xmath7 from bead @xmath35 . the polymeric jet is assumed as a viscoelastic maxwellian liquid so that @xmath37 evolves in time following the constitutive equation :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the elastic modulus , and @xmath41 is the viscosity of the fluid jet .",
    "finally , the velocity @xmath14 satisfies the kinematic relation :    @xmath42    the set of three eqs [ eq : force - eom ] , [ eq : stress - ode ] and [ eq : pos - eom ] governs the time evolution of system .    the nozzle bead with charge @xmath43 and @xmath44 is experiencing uniform circular motion in order to model fast mechanical oscillations of the spinneret@xcite , where we denote @xmath45 the amplitude of the perturbation and @xmath46 its frequency .",
    "the initial simulation conditions as well as the jet insertion at the nozzle are briefly described in the following .",
    "we assume that all the electrospinning simulations start with a single jet bead , which is placed at distance @xmath47 from the nozzle along the @xmath48 axis .",
    "the single bead represents a jet with a cross - sectional radius @xmath49 , defined as the radius of the filament at the nozzle before the stretching process .",
    "the jet bead has an initial velocity @xmath50 along the @xmath48 axis which is impressed by the bulk fluid velocity in the syringe needle . evolving in time the system",
    ", this jet bead travels up to a distance @xmath51 away from the nozzle , and a new jet bead is placed at distance @xmath47 between the two previous bodies ( nozzle and previous jet bead ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated so that we obtain a series of @xmath0 beads representing the jet .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath47 represents the length step which is used to discretize the polymer solution filament in discrete elements , and , in other words , it is the spatial resolution imposed at the nozzle before the stretching process starts acting .",
    "each simulation starts with only two bodies : the nozzle bead at fixed at @xmath44 and a single bead modelling an initial jet segment of cross - sectional radius @xmath52 located at distance @xmath47 from the nozzle along the @xmath48 axis with an initial velocity @xmath53 along the @xmath48 axis equal to the bulk fluid velocity in the nozzle . here",
    ", @xmath47 denotes the length step used to discretize the polymer solution filament in discrete elements , and , in other words , it is the spatial resolution imposed at the nozzle before the stretching process starts acting . under the effect of the external electric field",
    "the jet bead starts to move towards the collector , and as soon as it is a distance of @xmath51 away from the nozzle , a new jet bead ( third body ) is placed at distance @xmath47 from the nozzle along the straight line joining the two previous bodies ( further details in ref .",
    "given a series of discrete elements representing a liquid jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dem - diagram ] ) , our main objective is to recover a finer representation , as soon as it has become too coarse .",
    "as example , if our aim is to investigate cross section fluctuations of the nanofiber deposited on the collector at a length scale of 1 mm , as soon as the stretching process moves two beads of the discretized jet at mutual distance larger than 1 mm , the representation is too coarse for resolving such fluctuations at the desired length scale . for this purpose , we note that the jet elements define a natural parametrization of a string ( curve ) , which starts and ends at two given extreme points .",
    "thus , we borrow and adapt ideas and techniques from elements of the simplified string method originally proposed by e. weinan et al .",
    "@xcite for computing the minimum energy path in an energy landscape context . in the original simplified string method ,",
    "a string is dynamically evolved in the free energy landscape in order to identify the reactive path connecting two minima through a saddle point ( usually the transition state of the process under investigation ) .",
    "an initial string is discretized by a uniform mesh ( points equally spaced ) . then",
    ", the string ( each point of the mesh ) is evolved in time by a steepest descent dynamics and the mesh undergoes the break of its uniform distribution . at constant time interval",
    ", a check on the mesh uniformity is performed , and , if necessary , the uniform representation of the mesh is reinforced by a cubic spline interpolation . here , our idea is to apply a refinement procedure at constant time interval during the jet hydrodynamics whenever the mutual distance between any two consecutive elements representing the jet exceeds a prescribed threshold .",
    "note that the refinement procedure should be performed before the jet representation is scattered by the stretching dynamics .",
    "in other words , we wish to preserve the modeling information before it vanishes .    by integrating in time the equations of motion above ( see the field `` integrate the system '' in fig [ fig : flow ] ) , the observable @xmath54 defined in eq [ eq : define - l ] between two consecutive elements @xmath7 and @xmath36 is found to increase under the main action of the external electric field .",
    "the algorithm proceeds in three steps as follows :    _ _ _ _    at regular interval time @xmath55 , we compute the mutual distance @xmath54 between all the elements of the actual jet representation . note that the parameter @xmath55 should be set in order to perform the check before the information of the jet representation is lost due to the stretching . starting from the nozzle @xmath56 , all the mutual distance @xmath54 are tested for checking whether the length @xmath54 is larger than a prescribed threshold length @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , we mark by @xmath58 $ ] the bead closest to the nozzle , whose distance @xmath59 to the next bead @xmath60 is larger than threshold @xmath57 ( see fig [ fig : rep - interp ] ) .",
    "if @xmath61 for any @xmath7 , the simulation proceeds normally , otherwise we move to the second step .    _",
    "_    we introduce the curvilinear coordinate @xmath62 $ ] to parametrize the jet path , where @xmath63 identifies the nozzle , and @xmath64 the jet at the collector . for each bead",
    "we compute its respective @xmath65 value by using the formula :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the jet path length from the nozzle to the collector . in other words , we calculate the arc - lengths corresponding to the current parametrization of the string ( polymer solution jet ) .",
    "the set of @xmath68 values represent the mesh used to build a cubic spline .",
    "denoted generically by @xmath69 one of the main quantities describing the jet , the data @xmath70 are tabulated and used in order to compute the coefficients of the spline . note that several piecewise cubic functions are available in the literature @xcite . here",
    ", we use the akima s algorithm @xcite in order to compute spline coefficients , since it was demonstrated that other natural cubic splines could oscillate , whenever the tabulated values change quickly @xcite .",
    "the cubic coefficients are computed for all the main quantities describing the jet beads ( positions , fiber radius , stress , velocities )    _ _    the filament is refined starting from the bead with index @xmath71 up to the last bead ( the farthest bead from the nozzle @xmath72 ) , and only in this part of the string a uniform discretization of arc - length equal to @xmath57 is imposed to the representation . in fact",
    ", we use a uniform discretization only for the sake of simplicity , and this choice is not mandatory .",
    "the interpolation is performed by using the spline coefficients previously computed in the _",
    "second step_. starting from the bead with index @xmath71 , we enforce the equal arc - length parametrization ( uniform parametrization ) of the filament by imposing all the arc - lengths of the elements to be equal to @xmath57 ( see fig [ fig : rep - interp ] ) .",
    "first of all , we define the number of beads in the new representation as :    @xmath73    where the symbol @xmath74 denotes the ceiling function . denoted @xmath75 , the new mesh @xmath76 is obtained as :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the value of the parameter @xmath79 at the bead @xmath71 .",
    "note that it is still @xmath80 $ ] , and the parameter @xmath81 has the same values from zero ( the nozzle ) up to the bead @xmath71 . in this way , we do not apply the refinement procedure close to the nozzle , where new beads are added to the system , in order to not perturb the mechanism of bead injection ( for the injection mechanism see ref @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the new values @xmath82 are computed for all the @xmath83 by _",
    "spline interpolation_. the procedure is performed for @xmath69 to be positions , fiber radius , stress and velocities of the jet beads in order to provide the corresponding quantities in the new mesh @xmath76 .",
    "then , the new system is evolved in time following eqs .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in principle , it is also possible to define an adaptive mesh of the string by using a suitable weight function of a generic observable @xmath84 of the string ( e.g. jet radius ) .    a summarizing flow chart of the algorithm has been sketched in fig [ fig : flow ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that , notwithstanding the length of the curve in eq [ eq : first ] is computed by linear interpolation , the above procedure of reparametrization has the accuracy of a third - degree polynomial , since we use akima s cubic spline for the interpolation of the curve .",
    "this is fine , since we care mostly about preserving the string accuracy than computing carefully its arc - length .",
    "the dynamic refinement method was implemented in a modified version of jetspin , an open - source code specifically developed for electrospinning simulations @xcite .",
    "the jetspin code delivers a discrete element model , which bases on the model originally introduced by reneker et al .",
    "@xcite . as a test case",
    ", we perform a simulation for a polyvinylpyrrolidone ( pvp ) solution , which is commonly used in electrospinning experiments @xcite .",
    "the simulations are carried out by using the simulation parameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , modeled on the experimental data reported by montinaro et al .",
    "for convenience , all the simulation parameters are summarized in tab . [",
    "tab : simulation - param ] .",
    "we now consider two different simulations ( in the following _ case i _ and _ case ii _ ) , the second incorporating the mesh - refined algorithm .",
    "the simulations were integrated in time for 0.2 second by the fourth order rungekutta method with a time step equal to @xmath85 sec , and the jet beads were inserted at a distance @xmath86 cm from the nozzle . in the second simulation the dynamic refinement is applied every @xmath87 seconds . during the refinement procedure",
    "we impose all the arc - lengths @xmath57 equal to 0.2 cm for the new parametrization . in both simulations ,",
    "we distinguish two different regimes of the observables describing the electrospinning process . in the first",
    ", the observables follow an initial drift when the jet has not reached the collector yet . then",
    ", all the observables fluctuate around a constant mean value ( stationary regime ) after the jet touches the collector . here , we focus our attention on the latter regime .",
    "given the series of @xmath0 beads representing the jet , we define the observable :    @xmath88    where @xmath54 is the mutual distance between @xmath7 and @xmath36 elements , and @xmath47 the length step .",
    "we stress that @xmath89 $ ] , and , in particular , @xmath90 is equal to 1 at the nozzle , since @xmath91 is imposed equal to the length step @xmath47 , which is used to discretize the jet before stretching , and it works as a resolving power indicator of the actual jet representation at a specific point of the filament . note that in the following , we use the notation @xmath92 instead of @xmath93 just for the sake of simplicity , exploiting that , given a configuration , a unique value of @xmath79 is associated to each @xmath1 bead , where the observable @xmath93 is computed . in fig . [",
    "fig : resolving ] we show the mean value @xmath94 computed as function of the curvilinear coordinate @xmath79 over the entire stationary regime . here",
    ", we observe a quick decrease of @xmath94 for the _ case i_. for instance , the resolving power @xmath95 is already 1/40 of its initial value at @xmath79 equal to 0.1 , and it continues to decrease up to 1/200 of the initial @xmath95 value close the collector at curvilinear coordinate @xmath64 . on the other hand , the resolving power @xmath95 for the @xmath96 is larger than 0.075 for any value of @xmath79 , showing that the algorithm is efficient in preventing too coarse discretization of the jet .",
    "thus , we obtain the finer representation of the polymeric filament displayed in fig . [",
    "fig : representation - filament ] , where the beads belonging to the new discretization are colored in red , and the grains of the old one are in blue .    the higher resolving power @xmath95 of _ case ii _ safeguards a finer discrete representation of the jet which is a continuous object .",
    "this is particularly useful in modeling varicosity @xcite . as an example , we report an electrospinning simulation of a varicose jet in order to test our refinement method in this special framework . here",
    ", varicose jet stands for a filament with rapid fluctuations in its cross section radius .",
    "the varicosity was artificially induced by inserting at the nozzle a bead every ten beads with an extra 10% of mass , while all the other parameters are kept the same as in tab .",
    "[ tab : simulation - param ] .",
    "this extra mass models a solid impurity , which triggers the varicosity along its jet path from the nozzle towards the collector . in fig . [ fig : collector ] we report a short segment of the filament deposited at the collector for the two cases . here , we note that in _ case ii _ the mesh refinement is capable of representing the fluctuation of the cross section along the nanofiber . on the other hand ,",
    "such information is completely missed in the _ case i _ , where the filament results at lower resolution .",
    "this highlights the utility of the dynamic refinement procedure , whenever our aim is to model nanofiber features of small length - scale .",
    "next , we offer few comments on the parameter @xmath57 which defines the resolution parameter used in the spline interpolation of the string .",
    "it was observed by yarin et al @xcite that the discrete element modeling of a fiber by 0-dimensional point particles ( beads ) implies mathematical inconsistencies , as the discretization density increases .",
    "indeed , the modeled fiber tends to an infinitely thin , one - dimensional continuous object , invalidating thus the discrete bead model .",
    "the repulsive coulomb force is the term incurring in such issue , since the electrostatic force between two consecutive jet segments of length @xmath47 and with their junction point at @xmath97 value in curvilinear coordinate is computed by the double integral    @xmath98    where @xmath99 denotes the position vector along the string at curvilinear coordinate @xmath79 , and @xmath100 is the linear charge density .",
    "it is easily seen that the integral diverges as the parameter @xmath57 tends to zero . in an analytical study yarin",
    "et al.@xcite addressed this issue by arguing that charges are not distributed on the centerline of the fiber , but they lies rather on its outer shell of circular shape .",
    "thus , the problem is recovered by accounting for the actual electrostatic form factors between two interacting circular sections of a charged filament . in this context",
    ", several analytical approximations were developed @xcite for computing the local electric force acting between two contiguous rings representing jet elements .",
    "we recommend to use one of the mentioned analytical approximations , if really low values of @xmath57 are employed during the dynamics refinement procedure .",
    "however , a reasonable value of @xmath57 can be assessed in order to maintain a fine jet representation and avoiding , at the same time , mathematical inconsistencies . in particular , the coulomb integral for the electrostatic repulsion between two interacting rings can be numerically computed and compared with eq .",
    "[ eq : coulomb - int ] in order to estimate the error introduced by the centerline approximation at the given value of @xmath57 . a conservative value of @xmath57 larger than the length step @xmath47 introduces a negligible error due to the centerline approximation . in this work",
    ", we impose a value of @xmath57 which is an order of magnitude larger than length step @xmath47 . in order to justify the last statement",
    ", we report in fig [ fig : resolution - comp4 ] snapshots of several simulations performed with three distinct values of @xmath57 equal to 0.2 cm , 0.4 cm , 0.8 cm , and a fourth simulation without the dynamic refinement activated at time @xmath13 equal to 0.009 seconds , just 0.001 seconds before the jet touches the ground . here , it is evident as the jet topology is substantially equivalent , confirming that possible errors introduced by our approximation for the coulomb force of eq [ eq : force - coul ] at our operative values of @xmath57 are negligible .",
    "furthermore , it is worth to stress that a small value of @xmath57 also implies a larger computational cost of the simulation .",
    "indeed , the computation of the repulsive coulomb force is a @xmath0-body problem , which scales as @xmath101 with @xmath0 denoting the number of discrete elements .",
    "as example , we report in tab . [",
    "tab : cpu - time ] the cpu wall - clock time of the three electrospinning simulations , with the dynamic refinement procedure and @xmath57 equal to 0.2 cm , 0.4 cm , and 0.8 cm , previously mentioned . along with these data , the computational cost of a simulation without dynamic refinement",
    "is also shown .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we also report in tab . [",
    "tab : cpu - time ] the parallel efficiency @xmath102 , which is defined as @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 the cpu wall - clock time for the same job executed in serial and parallel mode , and @xmath106 the number of cpus involved in the parallel run . here",
    ", we note that the increase of effective cpu time is dependent on the average number of discrete elements @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "in particular , we note that the simulation with dynamic refinement implies a higher cpu cost than a classical simulation ( _ case i _ ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kowalewski et al . addressed the problem by using the hierarchical force calculation algorithm ( treecode ) for computing the coulomb force , which complexity scales as @xmath107 @xcite . the fast multiple method ( fmm )",
    "@xcite can be also used to handle long - range interactions with a high computational efficiency , which theoretically achieves @xmath108 operation count .",
    "the treecode and fmm are the best candidate to overcome this issue , and its implementation in our dynamic refinement code will be considered in future works .",
    "we have presented a dynamic mesh refinement method for addressing low resolution problems in discrete element models of jet hydrodynamics . in particular ,",
    "we have shown by practical examples that the proposed algorithm is able to recover a finer representation by enforcing a uniform arc - length discretization of a fluid jet at constant time interval , before the information describing the modeled object is scattered downstream .",
    "furthermore , the preserved jet representation is able to model short - range phenomena , such as varicosity , providing more realistic simulations . in this work ,",
    "we have described the basic structure of the algorithm and the main steps for its implementation in discrete element models of the electrospinning process .",
    "in addition , we have discussed the effect of low values of the resolution parameter @xmath57 on discrete element models and on the relative computational costs , so as to provide general guidelines for using the dynamics refinement procedure in electrospinning models .    in summary ,",
    "the presented algorithm may be used for investigating complex short - range phenomena of unidimensional liquid jets as well as to improve the accuracy of discrete element models in representing electro - hydrodynamic processes .",
    "several existing models might benefit of dynamic refinement in order to better support experiments , and provide useful insights for enhancing the efficiency of several processes involving jet hydrodynamics .",
