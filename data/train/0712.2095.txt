    "fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquids are remarkable many - electron systems that possesses nontrivial topological order .  @xcite such topological order is reflected in experimental measurable quantities , including the ( fractional ) charge and statistics angle of the gapped quasiparticle / quasihole excitations supported by the system , and the spectra of gapless edge excitations . by now a large number of different fqh states , usually labeled by a landau level ( ll ) filling factor @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the number of electrons and @xmath4 the number of flux quanta enclosed in the system ) , have been observed experimentally .",
    "most of these fqh states are the laughlin states or their hierarchy descendents .",
    "these are abelian fqh states whose quasiparticles obey abelian fractional statistics , and their edge excitations are made of chiral bosonic modes .",
    "the quasiparticle charge has been measured in some of these states ,  @xcite and measurement of the statistics angle has been attempted recently .",
    "@xcite edge excitations of such fqh states have also been probed using electron tunneling  @xcite and other methods .",
    "recently much interest and attention have focused on a special fqh state with filling factor @xmath5 , first observed twenty years ago .",
    "@xcite interest in this system is driven in part by numerical work  @xcite that suggests the moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite is likely realized in the half - filled first excited landau level ( 1ll ) at this filling factor .",
    "@xcite the moore - read state is qualitatively different from the laughlin states and their descendents , in that it is a non - abelian fqh state , whose quasiparticles obey non - abelian statistics  @xcite and whose edge excitations include a branch of _ fermionic _ mode .  @xcite it has been suggested that non - abelian quasiparticles can be used for topological quantum computation ,  @xcite further fueling the interest in this system .",
    "it is known that the pfaffian state is not particle - hole symmetric .",
    "it was pointed out very recently@xcite that the particle - hole transformed pfaffian state , termed the anti - pfaffian state , is also a contender at @xmath5 .",
    "these two states are closely related , but different in important ways that have experimental consequences .",
    "while the electron - electron interaction is particle - hole symmetric when projected onto a half - filled ll , which suggests these two states would be degenerate if this were the only term present in the microscopic hamiltonian , in reality the degeneracy between the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states is lifted by terms that break particle - hole symmetry .",
    "these include ll mixing  @xcite and , as we will show later , confining potential .",
    "in this paper we report results of a numerical study of the half filled 1ll in a disc geometry .",
    "our study is complementary to earlier numerical works based on the sphere  @xcite and torus  @xcite geometries , because the disc is the only geometry that allows one to study edge states and the closely related physics associated with a confining potential .",
    "our results can be briefly summarized as follows . by varying both the electron - electron interaction and confining potential , various types of ground states are stabilized .",
    "we find that the moore - read pfaffian and possibly the anti - pffafian ground states are realized in different regions of the parameter space of our model . within our model",
    "they appear to be separated by an intermediate state that we interpret as a stripe state .",
    "we further study the quasihole and edge excitations of the pfaffian state , and show that they indeed have the properties predicted by theory .",
    "furthermore , we are able to extract the velocities of the pfaffian edge modes , which are of importance in addressing both qualitative and quantitative issues that arise in experimental studies of the edge states ,  @xcite especially those involving quasiparticle tunneling in a double point - contact interferometer .",

    "we note that while the moore - read pfaffian wave function eq .",

    "however , there is a more transparent formulation of the three - body hamiltonian in terms of projection operators ,  @xcite which can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a three - particle wave function specified below [ eq .  ( [ eqn:3pwf ] ) ] and @xmath29 is the total angular momentum of the state .",
    "the hamiltonian for three particles produces a single non - zero eigenvalue which is unity ( provided sufficient number of orbitals are allowed ) as a true projection operator should .",
    "this is the most natural way to define the scale of the three - body hamiltonian .",
    "it is simpler to analyze @xmath30 for bosons first .",
    "the corresponding expression for fermions , as usual , is obtained by multiplication of an appropriate jastrow factor .",
    "the moore - read wave function for bosons contains one unit of relative angular momentum in the laughlin factor for each pair , instead of two for fermions . as a result",
    "when three particles are brought together the relative angular momentum is @xmath31 ( instead of @xmath32 ) .",
    "we now need to project out all relative angular momenta smaller than two . in this case , the only possibility is angular momentum zero ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "the relative wave function is thus a constant .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath29 will have to be absorbed by the center of mass wave function , which is @xmath33 . for fermions",
    "the normalized wave function is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and the normalization factor is : @xmath36 the total angular momentum of the jastrow factor @xmath37 is 3 and that of the center of mass is @xmath38 , giving a total angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the three - body interaction @xmath9 has a rather simple form in the occupation space : @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a completely antisymmetric function of its arguments .",
    "with @xmath42 we have : @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the antisymmetrizer in @xmath45 .",
    "the difference between the spectra of this form of the hamiltonian and the one with the @xmath46-functions is an overall factor of @xmath47 in the latter .",
    "while there are more efficient ways to obtain the moore - read state  @xcite that avoid diagonalizing a three - body hamitonian , here we need the @xmath9 to generate the spectrum of the mixed three - body and the two - body coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath11 includes a two - body coulomb ( @xmath48 ) interaction and a one - body confining potential provided by the neutralizing background charge distributed uniformly on a parallel disk of radius @xmath49 , placed at a distance @xmath50 above the 2deg .",
    "this distance parameterizes the strength of the confining potential , which decreases with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "the rotationally invariant confining potential comes from the coulomb attraction between the background charge and the electrons . using the symmetric gauge we can write down the following hamiltonian for the electrons confined to the 1ll : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electron creation operator for the first excited landau level ( 1ll ) single electron state with angular momentum @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 s are the corresponding matrix elements of coulomb interaction for the symmetric gauge , and @xmath55 s the matrix elements of the confining potential .",
    "additional details of this model can be found in ref .   where we studied edge reconstruction of abelian fractional quantum hall states at different @xmath56 , including explicit expressions of @xmath57 and @xmath41 and an illustration of the electrostatic configuration associated with @xmath11 ( see fig . 1 of ref .  ) .",
    "the confining potential we use here is motivated by the @xmath46-doping technique in 2deg fabrication . for gaas / algaas heterostructures ,",
    "silicon impurities are deposited in an atomically thick layer at a distance @xmath58   above the interface where 2deg is located to reduce impurity scattering .",
    "therefore , we model the background potential arising from these ionized silicon impurities , which ensure charge neutrality in the samples . even at an electrostatic level it is clear that @xmath50 parameterizes the strength of the confining potential . at small @xmath50",
    "the potential is strong and also sharp near the edge , while at large @xmath50 the potential is weak and smooth near the edge .",
    "alternatively , one may tune the background charge density ( right at the 2deg plane ) by smearing out the edge charge density as in an earlier study of edge reconstruction in integer quantum hall liquids .",
    "@xcite in the study of abelian fractional quantum hall liquids , we find that , e.g. , the laughlin - like state is stable up to @xmath59 , beyond which edge reconstruction takes place .",
    "@xcite while we expect the parameter @xmath50 appropriately characterizes the confining potential , we note the detailed sample structures and fabrication processes have an effect on how realistic the model is .",
    "to study the physics at @xmath0 , we explicitly keep the electronic states in the half - filled 1ll only , while neglecting the spin up and down electrons in the lowest landau level ( 0ll ) , assuming they are inert . the amount of positive background charge is chosen to be equal to that of the half - filled 1ll , so the system is neutral . the choice of a disc radius @xmath60 , where @xmath21 is the number of electrons in the 1ll , guarantees that the disk encloses exactly @xmath61 magnetic flux quanta , corresponding to @xmath62 in the 1ll .",
    "this is a simplification of the real system . in reality",
    ", the background charge equals the _ total _ electron charge of both the half - filled 1ll and the filled 0ll electrons .",
    "the latter neutralizes 4/5 of the background charge in the bulk , but this neutralization effect is incomplete near the edge due to finite @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , the location of the 0ll edge is different from that of the 1ll electrons ( see fig .  [ fig : landaulevels ] ) .",
    "the physical consequences of these effects will be discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . in this study",

    "considering the relatively small overlap and rather narrow window of stability in @xmath50 , one might wonder if the @xmath67 ground state is indeed in the same universality class as the moore - read state . to answer this question",

    "as the ground state of the microscopic model is very sensitive to the parameters of the system , such as the background confining potential ( by tuning @xmath50 ) and the weight ( @xmath8 ) of the three - body interaction @xmath9 , one may ask if additional features besides the total angular momentum can offer further support that the ground state is in the same phase as the moore - read state .",
    "in fact , one of the most striking properties of the moore - read state is that it supports charge @xmath1 quasihole / particle excitations , which carry _ half _ the charge of a laughlin quasihole / particle at this filling factor .",
    "they obey non - abelian statistics , and their existence implies that electrons are paired in the ground state ( in the same way that observation of @xmath81 vortices indicate electrons are paired in superconductors ) .",
    "we note that the halperin 331 state  @xcite also supports @xmath82 charge .",
