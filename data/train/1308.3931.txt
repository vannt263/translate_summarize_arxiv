    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most powerful explosions that occur throughout the universe from local to extremely high redshift ( e.g. , salvaterra et al .",
    "2009 ; tanvir et al .",
    "the majority of grbs show a long - duration ( @xmath3s ) and soft - spectrum in their prompt phase .",
    "it is now generally accepted that these grbs originate from the death of young massive stars ( @xmath4 ) according to the core - collapse model ( e.g. , see reviews in hjorth & bloom 2011 and woosley & bloom 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the jet ignited in the core - collapse is believed to impact and shock the surrounding medium , which produces the grb s afterglow through synchrotron radiation at a wide wavelength range from radio to x - ray ( e.g. , meszaros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "both x - ray and optical / near - infrared observations of afterglows provide an opportunity to study the metal abundance and column density in grb s local environment ( e.g. , savaglio et al . 2003 ; butler et al .",
    "2003 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2007 ) . combining",
    "the spectral analysis in both bands suggests that the measured optical extinction is typically smaller than the expectation inferred from the x - ray - derived column density of gas by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , although the column density is comparable to that in galactic molecular clouds ( e.g. , galama & wijers 2001 ; stratta et al .",

    "greiner et al . 2011 ; zafar et al . 2011 ; kruhler et al . 2011 ; campana et al . 2006 ; 2010 ; watson et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the large column density - to - dust ratio could be explained by the destruction of small dust grains out to a radius of @xmath510pc by the intense prompt emission of the grb ( e.g. fruchter et al .",
    "2001 ; perna & lazzati 2001 ; perna et al . 2003 ) .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and watson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) claimed that the large ratio could be alternatively caused by either higher metallicity or stronger photoioniztion of hydrogen due to the grb s high energy emission .",
    "schady et al . (",
    "2010 ) , however , found a tight anti - correlation between the column density - to - dust ratio and metallicity , which is in conflict with the expectation inferred from the metallicity scenario .",
    "kruhler et al . (",
    "2010 ) argued that the observed large ratio is mainly caused by two independent absorbers .",
    "one is a neutral absorber related to host galaxy that is located at a distance of @xmath6pc from the burst ; the other is an ionized one that is in the vicinity of the burst .",
    "thanks to the _ swift  mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) and prompt follow - up observations in the optical band , a large grb sample has recently shown that there is a correlation between the intrinsic x - ray column density and redshift ( e.g. , campana et al .",
    "2010 ; behar et al . 2011 ; starling et al .",
    "in addition , campana et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and watson & jakobsson ( 2012 ) show that the bursts with high column density can occur at low - to - moderate redshift when highly extinguished events are included",
    ". there is , however , a lack of bursts with low x - ray column density at high redshift .",
    "the correlation motivates various authors to argue that the x - ray column density excess could be explained by the photo - electric absorption due to diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) or intervening absorbing clouds , even though the intrinsic absorption from a host galaxy is required for nearby grbs ( e.g. , behar et al .",
    "2011 ; starling et al .",
    "2013 ; campana et al .",
    "2012 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "watson & jakobsson ( 2012 ) argued that the intervening clouds alone seem to be insufficient to account for the large column density found in high - z grbs . _    in this paper ,",
    "we present a piece of evidence supporting the conclusion that the observed x - ray column density excess is at least partially caused by the cumulative effect that results from the intervening systems in the line - of - sight of a grb .",
    "because of the poor spectral resolution of current x - ray observations , the foreground absorption of @xmath7 doublet is used as a tracer of the intervening systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample selection is described in  2 .",
    " 3 then compares the intervening absorption with the intrinsic x - ray column density to reveal the contribution from the intervening absorption systems .",
    "thanks to the rapid - response spectroscopy of high - z grb s optical afterglows , the absorption of @xmath82796 , 2803 doublet is a commonly used transition in studying the intervening absorbing clouds in the line - of - sight of a grb , both because of the relative high abundance of mg and because of the high strength of the transition ( e.g. , prochter et al .",
    "2006 ; prochaska et al 2007 ; tejos et al .",
    "2009 ; vergani et al . 2009 ; cucchiara et al . 2012 ) .    we compile a sample of all available _ swift  grbs with intervening doublet absorption reported in literature .",
    "no cut on the intervening @xmath9 equivalent width ( ew ) is used in our sample compilation .",
    "we further require that the measured rest - frame ews of both lines in the doublet are available for each intervening absorber .",
    "the sample finally contains 29 grbs , and is tabulated in table 1 , along with the references .",
    "all the errors reported in the table correspond to the 1@xmath10 significance level after taking into account the proper error propagation . _    for each grb , columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) list the grb identification and measured redshift of the grb , respectively .",
    "the redshifts of the identified intervening absorption systems are tabulated in column ( 3 ) .",
    "columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) present the ew of @xmath9 and the corresponding doublet ratio @xmath11 , respectively . for",
    "each afterglow with multiple intervening absorption systems , columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) list the values of the intervening absorber with the lowest dr value .",
    "the corresponding redshift of the absorber is marked in boldface type in column ( 3 ) . in these afterglows",
    ", we further check if there are multiple intervening absorbers with @xmath2 in each line - of - sight , and mark the corresponding redshifts with an asterisk in column ( 3 ) . the intrinsic x - ray column density @xmath12 is listed in column ( 6 ) for each of the grbs .",
    "the column density is obtained from the x - ray energy spectrum in the _",
    "swift  xrt photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "the spectrum taken in the windowed timing mode , if any , is not adopted to avoid the possible spectral evolution at early time ( e.g. , campana et al . 2007 ; gendre et al .",
    "_    in the current sample , the x - ray column density @xmath12 ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the sample reproduces the previously reported @xmath12 versus @xmath15 correlation ( see the citations in introduction ) .",
    "the relationship is presented in figure 1 for the current sample . by excluding the grbs with upper limits of @xmath12 ,",
    "a statistical test returns a kendall s @xmath16 , @xmath17-value of 2.81 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the probability that there is no correlation between the two variables .",
    "a few of grbs with high column density and heavy optical extinction have been identified in the low - to - moderate redshift range ( campana et al .",
    "2012 ; watson & jakobsson 2012 ) .",
    "the heavy extinction most likely results in a selection bias against these bursts in the current sample .",
    "watson & jakobsson ( 2012 ) stated that the redshifts of these bursts are mainly obtained from the observations of their host galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows the relation between @xmath12 and optical extinction @xmath20 for the current sample , when the values of @xmath20 are reported in literature .",
    "we list the values of @xmath20 in column ( 8) in table 1 . the dashed line shown in the figure marks the typical dust - to - gas ratio for the local group in the case with solar metallicity ( welty et al .",
    "one can see from the figure an evident excess of @xmath12 with respect to the optical extinction , and a marginal increase of @xmath12 with @xmath20 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath21 ratio is @xmath22 , which is highly consistent with the one reported in covino et al .",
    "we use the intervening doublet absorption as a tracer of the foreground absorption system to study the origin of the x - ray column density excess detected in grbs .",
    "the absorption traces a wide range of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( corresponding to an ew(2796 ) from 0.02 to 10 , e.g. , churchill et al .",
    "2000 ; rao & turnshek 2000 ; rigby et al . 2002 ) . by using the expanded sdss / hst sample of low - z lyman-@xmath26 absorbers ,",
    "menard & chelouche ( 2009 ) reveals a relationship between mean @xmath23 and ew(2796 ) , although the relationship has very large scatter .",
    "it has been frequently pointed out that the ew of @xmath272976 line is a better indicator of number of individual components and/or the velocity spread of the gas than an indicator of @xmath23 ( e.g. , petitjean & bergeron 1990 ; prochter et al .",
    "2006 ; gupta et al .",
    "it is noted that a low dr close to 1 more directly reflects high column density than does ew(2796 ) ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the dr of the doublet theoretically ranges from 1.0 for completely saturated lines to 2.0 for unsaturated lines according to atomic physics . in the current sample ,",
    "@xmath580% grbs have drs within the range @xmath28 ( within the errors ) . after taking into account the errors , the remaining grbs listed in our sample have drs very close to the upper and lower theoretical limits .",
    "the mean and median values of dr are 1.18 and 1.15 , respectively , which means there is a strong saturation for these intervening absorption clouds .",
    "if the x - ray column density excess was only attributed to the gas related to the host galaxy , the strength of intervening absorption is expected to be physically unrelated with the x - ray column density .",
    "figure 3 presents the dr versus @xmath12 diagram .",
    "a moderately strong anti - correlation can be identified from the diagram : the larger the dr , the smaller the x - ray column density will be .",
    "a statistical test yields a kendall s @xmath29 and a @xmath17-value of 2.091 at a significance level with a probability of null correlation of @xmath30 .",
    "these coefficients are calculated through the survival analysis to take account of the entries in which only upper limits of @xmath12 can be obtained from observations .",
    "the anti - correlation suggests a positive relationship between the observed x - ray column density and the column density traced by the intervening absorptions .",
    "the afterglows with multiple intervening absorbers are shown by the blue points , and the afterglows with a single absorber by the red ones .",
    "the size of the blue points is scaled to the number of saturated absorbers with @xmath2 .",
    "it seems that , as expected , the line - of - sight with more saturated absorbers tends to correspond to higher x - ray column density .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation with 1,000 random experiments is performed to investigate the effect caused by the larger errors in both dr and @xmath12 .",
    "a random sample is established by assuming a gaussian distribution for each measurement ( except for the upper limits ) .",
    "the kendall s @xmath31 test is then carried out for each of the 1,000 random samples .",
    "again , the tests are based on the survival analysis .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of the simulated kendall s @xmath31 .",
    "the distribution can be well described by a gaussian function with a peak at @xmath32 and a standard deviation of 0.06 . a weighted sum of the calculated probability of each random sample yields a total probability of null correlation of 0.368 , which indicates that the significance of the correlation degrades to the 1@xmath10 significance level when the large errors are taken into account .",
    "covino et al .",
    "( 2013 ) recently compared the x - ray column density with the neutral hydrogen column density measured from the local lyman-@xmath26 absorption .",
    "the comparison shows that there is a relation between the two independent measurements for some events listed in their sample .",
    "some outliers , however , can be clearly identified from their comparison .",
    "furthermore , the authors claimed that the relation is improved when the contribution of the intervening system is removed from the observed x - ray column density .",
    "the contribution is empirically estimated from the intervening absorption model proposed in campana et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    in order to additionally test the effect caused by the intervening system ,",
    "the dr is plotted in figure 5 as a function of the ratio between the column density measured from the x - ray spectrum and that measured from the local lyman-@xmath26 absorption . the host galaxy hydrogen column density ( @xmath23 )",
    "obtained from the lyman-@xmath26 observation is listed in column ( 7 ) in table 1 for each grb .",
    "the data are mainly taken from fynbo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , except for grb100219 ( thone et al . 2013 ) .",
    "grb060607 and grb050908 are not shown in the plot because of their extremely large ratios .",
    "the estimated ratios are @xmath33 and @xmath34 for grb060607 and grb050908 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding drs are as small as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "one can see from the figure that the grbs with large @xmath37 ratio ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) tend to have heavy line saturation with dr close to 1 .",
    "since a small dr caused by the saturation of @xmath39 line reflects a high neutral hydrogen column density , the trend suggests that the large x - ray column density observed in some grbs could be attributed to an additional absorption caused by their intervening system .",
    "similar to figure 3 , the line - of - sights with multiple ( single ) saturated absorbers are presented by the blue ( red ) points .",
    "the size of the blue point is again scaled to the number of saturated absorbers .",
    "although there is only one saturated absorbers in the line - of - sight of grb060607 , the grbs with @xmath40 tend to be associated with more than one saturated absorber .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath23 obtained from optical data and that from x - ray spectral analysis has been frequently reported in previous studies ( e.g. , starling et al .",
    "2007 ; schady et al .",
    "2010 ) . by using the doublet absorption that is taken from afterglow optical spectroscopy as a tracer of neutral hydrogen column density ,",
    "the statistical study in this paper reveals a connection in which a grb with high x - ray column density tends to be associated with large intervening neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "this connection therefore indicates an additional contribution of the intervening system to the observed @xmath12 in some grbs on observational grounds , which , however , does not mean a firm exclusion that the high @xmath12 values can be due to the host galaxy component alone . the contribution to x - ray column density needs to be quantified for each component to properly explain observations , which is a hard task at present because the current x - ray spectral resolution is too low to identify individual absorption features .",
    "the revealed connection between intervening hydrogen column density and @xmath12 can naturally explain the observed correlation between @xmath12 and redshift by including an extra x - ray absorption contributed by the intervening system .",
    "the scenario in which @xmath12 is dominantly contributed by the intervening system has been proposed by many previous studies . by doubling the number of intervening clouds that are derived from qso studies , the simulation done by campana et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggests that the intervening absorber scenario is a plausible explanation for the x - ray column density excess . with a more realistic model , starling et al .",
    "( 2013 ) proposed that the absorption due to the cumulative effect of intervening lyman-@xmath26 clouds can equally explain the x - ray column density excess .",
    "an alternative possible explanation of the discrepancy is the photoelectric absorption due to diffuse cold or warm intergalactic medium ( behar et al .",
    "2011 ; starling et al .",
    "2013 ) . a further support for the contribution of the intervening systems may come from the fact that the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath23 become tighter after subtracting to the x - ray values the mean contribution from intervening systems ( see covino et al .",
    "2013 ) . under some conditions",
    ", the intervening absorbers can also affect the @xmath41 determination and possibly contribute to the observed @xmath12 versus @xmath41 correlation found by watson et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and covino et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "watson & jakobsson ( 2012 ) argued that the intervening clouds seem to be insufficient to explain the column density excess after taking into account of the metallicity evolution and unjustified overabundance of intervening clouds in the grb s line - of - sight .",
    "in fact , a much weaker overabundance was recently revealed in cucchiara et al .",
    "( 2012 ) by re - analyzing a large sample of intervening absorption .",
    "watson et al . ( 2013 ) recently proposed that the absorption by helium in the host region is responsible for most of the observed x - ray column density , after excluding other scenarios .",
    "their argument is based on the @xmath42 ( @xmath23 ) correlation and a change of @xmath21 ratio with redshift that is similar to cosmic metallicity evolution .",
    "a recent study shows that the evolution of @xmath21 is likely caused by the lack of bursts with small @xmath12 at high redshift rather than the evolution of @xmath20 , although the physical origin of the lack has not been determined at the current stage ( covino et al .",
    "this result seems to be inconsistent with the implication of the scenario proposed in watson et al .",
