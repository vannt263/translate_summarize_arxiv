    "topological quantum error - correcting codes ( tqecc ) @xcite are defined on two - dimensional lattices of qubits with geometrically local parity checks .",
    "thus , they are a form of quantum ldpc codes with an additional locality requirement imposed to their tanner graph .",
    "to appreciate the importance of this feature , recall that in quantum mechanics , measuring a qubit alters its state . to detect errors ,",
    "it is not possible to measure each qubit separately and verify that they satisfy all the check conditions  like it is done classically  without destroying the encoded information . instead",
    ", it is necessary to perform a collective measurement on all the qubits involved in a given check , which requires having the qubits physically interact with each other , or with a mediator system .",
    "thus , having local checks is an extremely important feature that explains  together with the possibility of implementing some gates topologically @xcite  the growing interest in topological quantum codes .",
    "the prominent example of tqecc is kitaev s toric code family @xcite that we define below . for these codes ,",
    "defined on a toric qubit lattice , errors in the same homology class have the same effect on the encoded information .",
    "thus , maximum - likelihood decoding consists in identifying the lowest weight homology class of equivalent errors .",
    "previously , a decoding algorithm based on perfect matching @xcite was proposed which identifies the lowest weight error , ignoring the equivalence relation set by homology @xcite .",
    "the complexity of this algorithm is quite prohibitive , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the linear size of the lattice .",
    "other topological codes @xcite had no known efficient decoding algorithm .    in @xcite",
    "we presented a new decoding algorithm for tqecc .",
    "the essential idea of this algorithm borrows from the renormalization group method of statistical physics .",
    "intuitively , we can think of a tqecc on a lattice of linear size @xmath2 as consisting of @xmath3 levels of concatenation of a tqecc on a lattice of linear size 2 .",
    "concatenated quantum codes can be decoded efficiently by a recursive algorithm @xcite . starting from an error model characterizing the channel , each @xmath4 lattice is soft - decoded , producing an effective  renormalized \" error model on its logical qubits .",
    "this error model is passed to the next level of concatenation , and we recurse .",
    "the recursion ends after @xmath5 iterations , where it outputs a probability vector describing the encoded information .",
    "each round involves decoding at most @xmath6 constant size tqecc , so the overall complexity is @xmath7 and can easily be parallelized for a total runtime of @xmath8 .",
    "because tqecc are not truly concatenated codes , the intuition explained above can not be turned into a rigorous method , and some approximations are necessary . in this paper , we give a detailed presentation of the approximation techniques used in ref . @xcite and present some results obtained from our method .",
    "the state of a collection of @xmath9 qubits can be specified by a vector @xmath10 in the complex hilbert space @xmath11 .",
    "each vector space @xmath12 in this tensor decomposition is associated to a qubit .",
    "a code on @xmath9 qubits is a subspace of @xmath13 . for kitaev s code ",
    "like all stabilizer codes  this subspace is specified by a set of mutually commuting operators that play a role similar to the rows of a parity - check matrix .    to define these operators , it is convenient to display the qubits on a regular square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. with the topology of a torus .",
    "there is one qubit on each _ edge _ of the lattice , for a total of @xmath14 qubits for a @xmath15 lattice .",
    "for each site @xmath16 ( vertex ) of the lattice , we define a site operator @xmath17 and for each plaquette @xmath18 ( site of the dual lattice ) , we define a plaquette operator @xmath19 .",
    "these definitions use the pauli matrices @xmath20 and we use @xmath21 to denote the pauli operator @xmath22 acting on the qubit located on edge @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 where @xmath22 appears at position @xmath23 and @xmath25 denotes the @xmath4 identity matrix . the notation @xmath26 denotes the set of edges @xmath23 adjacent to site @xmath16 , and similarly for @xmath27 .    because @xmath28 , the pauli operators @xmath21 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 form a group under multiplication , the pauli group of @xmath9 qubits @xmath31 .",
    "every element in this group squares to the identity ( modulo a phase , that we henceforth omit ) .",
    "these generators obey canonical commutation relations : all pairs of generators commute , except @xmath21 and @xmath29 that anti - commute .",
    "it follows from these relations that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 all mutually commute .",
    "the commutation of the @xmath32 among themselves is trivial since they are all made up of @xmath22 matrices , and similarly for the commutation of the @xmath33 among themselves .",
    "the commutation of a @xmath32 with a @xmath33 follows from the fact that a site and a plaquette either have no common edge , or they have two .",
    "both cases imply an _ even _ number of anti - commuting operators , so they commute .",
    "the code is now defined as the subspace @xmath34 this is an eigenvalue equation , and because the @xmath32 and @xmath33 mutually commute , they indeed share common eigenvectors . in this definition of the code @xmath35 , the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 play a role analogous to the rows of a parity check matrix in a classical linear code in the sense that they impose ( local ) constraints on the codewords .",
    "we will consider errors @xmath36 from the pauli group .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the _ depolarizing channel_the natural generalization of the binary symmetric channel to the quantum setting  for which each qubit is left unchanged with probability @xmath37 , or is affected by @xmath22 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 each with probability @xmath40 . in other words , all errors @xmath36 from the @xmath9-qubit pauli group ( modulo phase ) are permitted , and the probability of a given error is @xmath41 where the weight of @xmath36 , denoted @xmath42 , is the number of tensor factors on which it differs from the identity ( generalizing the hamming weight ) .",
    "when an error @xmath36 occurs on a code state @xmath10 , the resulting state @xmath43 will in general no longer be a @xmath44 eigenstate of the star and plaquette operators : @xmath43 is a @xmath44 eigenstate of @xmath32 when @xmath36 and @xmath32 commute , and it is a @xmath45 eigenstate when they anti - commute , and similarly for @xmath33 . by measuring each star and plaquette operators ,",
    "we obtain a list of @xmath46 and @xmath47 forming the error syndrome @xmath48 . given these , error correction can proceed by identifying the most likely error compatible with the syndrome , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and applying this error again to correct it ( since @xmath51 ) . as we will now explain ,",
    "finding the most likely error is not the optimal decoding strategy in quantum mechanics .",
    "the property that @xmath32 and @xmath33 leave each code state invariant , c.f . ,",
    "is inherited by the abelian group generated by them , called the _ stabilizer group _ @xmath52 .",
    "this induces an equivalence relation between operators on @xmath13 . if two operators @xmath36 and @xmath53 differ by an element of @xmath54 , for instance if @xmath55 , then they will have an identical effect on @xmath35 by definition .",
    "notice that the plaquette operators @xmath33 are elementary loops of @xmath39 on the lattice , so their products generate the group of homologically trivial loops on the torus , see .",
    "likewise , the star operators generate the group of homologically trivial loops of @xmath22 on the dual lattice .",
    "we conclude that two operators @xmath36 and @xmath53 have the same effect on the code if @xmath56 contains only homologically trivial loops , in which case we say that @xmath36 and @xmath53 are homologically equivalent .",
    "operator on qubit associated to the edge , and blue line indicates a @xmath22 .",
    "all @xmath39-type operators are strings on the lattice while @xmath22-type operators are strings on the dual lattice .",
    "trivial loops on the a ) lattice and b ) dual lattice corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "loops with non - trivial homology c ) on the lattice and d ) on the dual lattice corresponding to the 4 generators of @xmath57 .",
    "e ) a trivial loop obtained by product of elementary trivial loops . ]",
    "on the other hand , there are 4 independent operators that map @xmath35 to itself ( i.e. commute with all star and plaquette operators ) but do not belong to @xmath54 ; they correspond to the homologically non - trivial loops of @xmath39 and @xmath22 around the hole and the body of the torus , see .",
    "they generate a group with @xmath58 operators called the _ logical pauli operators _ @xmath57 , and are associated with two encoded qubits . because @xmath59 and @xmath60 are equivalent for @xmath61 , the choice of the 4 generators of @xmath57 depicted on is to some extent arbitrary , only the homology class of the operators matters .",
    "thus optimal decoding consists in identifying the most likely class of homologically equivalent errors , in other words the most likely logical operator @xmath62 where @xmath63 is any reference error compatible with the error syndrome @xmath64 .",
    "error correction is completed by applying @xmath65 .",
    "although is expressed in terms of a specific choice of generators of @xmath57 and a specific reference error @xmath63 that are not topological invariants , the sum over @xmath54 makes the homology class of the correction operator @xmath65 independent of these choices .",
    "the optimal recovery scheme described above is in general very hard to achieve computationally . in particular , summing over the entire group of loops @xmath54 is a formidable task . to circumvent this difficulty , we will attempt to  divide and conquer \" using an approach inspired by the renormalization group method of statistical mechanics .",
    "we break the lattice into overlapping  unit cells \" as illustrated in .",
    "each of these cells contains 12 edges , and hence 12 qubits .",
    "the choice of this unit cell is somewhat arbitrary , but we will stick to this particular example for concreteness .",
    "this cell encloses 6 stabilizer generators in total , three plaquettes and three sites ( shown on the first two rows of ) .",
    "we can use these stabilizers to define a ( small ) error - correcting code  a surface code @xcite , open boundary version of kitaev s toric code .        to describe the algorithm ,",
    "it is convenient to choose a set of generators for the pauli group on the lattice .",
    "our choice is defined in .",
    "note that these operators obey canonical commutation relations , the same as the one of @xmath21 and @xmath29 : any two of these operators commute except for the two illustrated on the same unit cell that anti - commute .",
    "we also group these operators into three categories that play different roles in our algorithm , as we now explain .",
    "the stabilizer generators @xmath32 and @xmath33 play the same double role as explained in the previous section : they are measured to read - out the error syndrome , and they induce an equivalence relation between operators .",
    "they generate the stabilizer group @xmath54 containing @xmath66 elements .",
    "their conjugate partners @xmath67 and @xmath68 , that we call  pure errors \" , are used to construct the reference error @xmath63 appearing in in a systematic way .",
    "indeed , it follows from the canonical commutation relations that the operator @xmath69 is an error with syndrome @xmath64 .",
    "the four logical operators are representative of the homologically non - trivial loops ( although they do nt look like loops , they are strings with no ends on the lattice , which is the definition of a loop ) . they generate the logical group @xmath57 containing @xmath70 elements . in our recursive decoding algorithm",
    ", these four generators will be mapped onto single qubit operators on a renormalized lattice of half the linear size .",
    "hence , our goal is to assign probabilities to these logical operators , that will serve as an effective channel for the following recursion .",
    "finally , the four pairs of edge operators are needed to complete the set of generators , and correspond roughly ( but see below ) to qubits that are shared between neighboring unit cells .",
    "they generate the edge group @xmath71 containing @xmath72 elements .",
    "thus , they will be used to  glue \" neighboring unit cells into a renormalized unit cell used in the following recursion of the algorithm .    with these definitions in place",
    ", we can describe the elementary step of our renormalization procedure on a given cell , which consists in computing a conditional probability distribution .",
    "we are given a list of syndromes @xmath73 associated to the six stabilizer generators on the unit cell .",
    "we collectively denote these syndromes by @xmath3 .",
    "we are also given a probability @xmath74 of errors @xmath36 contained on the cell .",
    "in the first step of the recursion , this probability is set by the channel , e.g. , and in the @xmath75th step it is given by the output of step @xmath76 . from these ,",
    "we compute the joint probability on the logical and edge group elements conditioned on the syndrome @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the reference error defined at , and @xmath79 is a normalization factor . note that this equation is very similar to the definition of the maximum - likelihood decoder , except that we must now include edge operators and we do not commit to a hard decision but instead keep the entire probability vector .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all the unit cells of the lattice ( this can be done in parallel , so in a constant amount of time ) .",
    "we will be using different marginals of this probability .",
    "for each cell , we can define the marginal probability on the logical and edge operators by @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "notice that , up to multiplication by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the edge operators @xmath82 are supported only on those qubits that are shared between neighboring unit cells . for instance , the product @xmath83 is the operator @xmath22 acting on the bottom shared qubit , see .",
    "moreover , because the pure error component of the error is determined by @xmath3 , c.f . , we can directly interpret the conditional probability on the edge operators as a probability distribution for pauli operators on the shared qubits .",
    "this feature will be important when we describe how we glue unit cells together using belief propagation .",
    "each of these marginal probabilities can be broken down even further .",
    "remember that the logical operators @xmath57 are generated by two pairs of canonically conjugated operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , representing the two logical qubits , c.f . .",
    "thus , every operator in @xmath57 can be written as @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "we can consider the marginal on one of the two logical qubits by summing over the value of the other variable , e.g. @xmath89 .",
    "likewise , the edge operators are generated by four canonical pairs of edge operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 , each encoding an edge qubit , c.f . .",
    "we can express any edge operator as @xmath92 with @xmath93 , and consider marginals such as @xmath94 .",
    "following the discussion above , these marginal probabilities can be directly interpreted as probability of the pauli operators acting on the shared qubits .",
    "for instance , @xmath95 is the error probability of the bottom shared qubit conditioned on the error syndrome of the unit cell .     for this larger unit cell",
    "is obtained by combining the underlying logical operator distributions conditioned on the error syndromes of each cell .",
    "when both logical qubits of a unit cell participate in the construction of the larger cell , the induced error model on these qubits is correlated as illustrated on the figure . when only one logical operator participates in the construction , we consider the marginal distribution on that logical qubit . ]    to complete one step of the renormalization procedure , we join the logical operators from 8  bare \" unit cells into a larger renormalized unit cell as shown on . in a first approximation",
    ", we can use the probabilities @xmath96 from each bare unit cell to assign an effective error model to the renormalized unit cell .",
    "note that the conditional probability @xmath96 defined above is a joint probability distribution on two logical qubits .",
    "as a consequence , the renormalized error model can have correlated errors between neighboring qubits .",
    "this is not a problem when the two qubits appear in the same renormalized unit cell .",
    "we can take these correlations into account in our definition of the renormalized error model @xmath74 .",
    "however , when these two correlated qubits belong to two distinct renormalized unit cells , it is not possible to keep track of these correlations efficiently . in those cases ,",
    "we use the appropriate marginal distributions on each qubit to define the renormalized error model , see .",
    "in other words , we replace @xmath97 by @xmath98 .",
    "ignoring some of the correlations between the renormalized qubits is an approximation used to make our scheme efficient .",
    "the same procedure can now be executed on each renormalized unit cell .",
    "we can compute the various probabilities conditioned on the error syndromes contained in each cell . note that the renormalized star and plaquette operators each act on 8 bare qubits , spoiling the locality feature of kitaev s toric code . however , this renormalization of the star and plaquette operators is only for the purpose of presenting the decoding algorithm .",
    "the error syndrome associated to the renormalized stabilizer generators @xcite can be obtained by measuring the original 4-qubit star and plaquette operators and multiplying their outcomes as shown in .    at the last iteration of this renormalization procedure",
    ", we obtain a probability distribution over the logical operators of the encoded qubits , completing the soft decoding procedure .",
    "the operator with the largest probability can be selected to implement the correction .",
    "associated to a renormalized plaquette operator is equal to the binary product of the four smaller plaquette operators contained in it .",
    "this follows from the fact that all these operators commute , and the product of the four operators is equal to the renormalized operator .",
    "the same holds for the star operators . ]",
    "the unit cells used by the renormalization decoding algorithm overlap in the sense that some qubits are shared between two unit cells . without these overlaps , each unit cell would contain only 2 complete stabilizer generators ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 , see ) instead of 6 . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of variables of the renormalized error model would increase by a constant factor at each renormalization step , leading to an exponential blowup .",
    "thus , these shared qubits appear to be necessary . on the other hand , the presence of shared qubits leads to the main approximation of our decoding scheme : a qubit that is shared between two unit cells is treated independently by each one of them as if it were two independent random variables .",
    "this can lead to some inconsistencies as illustrated in .     as illustrated , and all the other error syndromes are @xmath44 . for the top cell ,",
    "three errors are equally likely to have caused this syndrome : an @xmath22 error on the qubit to the left , the bottom , or the right of the plaquette operator .",
    "similarly for the bottom cell , the two dominating errors that could have caused the syndrome are an @xmath22 error to the left and above the plaquette .",
    "but in fact , the bottom qubit of the top cell and the top qubit of the bottom cell are actually the same qubit ; a shared qubit .",
    "this qubit will be assigned a probability roughly @xmath101 of having an @xmath22 error by the top cell , while the bottom cell will assign the probability @xmath102 , which is inconsistent . on the other hand , because it is doubly suspicious , the probability of this qubit having suffered an @xmath22 error should be dominating , but decoding each cell independently fails to recognize this . ]    to improve on this approximation , we allow unit cells to exchange messages . the purpose of these messages is to update the error model of the shared qubits  or equivalently of the edge operators  conditioned on the syndromes of the immediate neighboring cells . in short",
    ", each cell computes the marginal conditional probability of each of its shared qubits ( or edge operators , as explained above ) , and passes the probability associated to a given edge qubit to the cell sharing it .",
    "all unit cells can perform this in parallel .",
    "then , each cell reweighs the prior error model of its edge qubits by the incoming messages . iterating this procedure leads to a probability that is conditionned on the syndromes of an extended neighborhood .",
    "the procedure can be formalized as a belief propagation algorithm .",
    "let @xmath103 denote the marginal probability assigned to edge qubit @xmath104 ( obtained from the channel model or the output of the previous renormalization step ) . at round @xmath105 , each cell @xmath106 outputs @xmath107 messages @xmath108 , one for each of its shared qubit @xmath104 , that correspond to some probability vector on @xmath109 .",
    "at the first round , these messages are initialized to the uniform distribution .",
    "the cell s outgoing messages at time @xmath105 become its neighbors incoming messages at time @xmath110 : if cells @xmath106 and @xmath111 share qubit @xmath104 , @xmath112 .",
    "the message update rule is given by @xmath113 where notation such as @xmath114 denotes the stabilizer group generated by the 6 generators enclosed in @xmath106 , the notation @xmath115 stands for the set of edge qubits contained in @xmath106 , and finally @xmath116 denotes all the edge qubits in @xmath106 except @xmath104 .",
    "the messages roughly converge to steady distributions after a few iterations of this procedure ( we typically use 3 , since the graph contains 4-cycles ) .",
    "once convergence is reached , the renormalization algorithm is executed on each cell as explained in the previous section , but using the incoming messages to the cell to reweigh the prior probabilities on the shared qubits .",
    "we have assessed the performance of our decoder using monte carlo sampling .",
    "figure [ fig : results ] summarizes our results .",
    "it shows a clear threshold near the depolarizing probability @xmath117 , very close to what is achieved by the perfect matching decoder of @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain an exponential gain in decoding time without significant performance loss .",
    "many modifications can be made to the basic decoding scheme presented here that allow tradeoffs between decoding complexity and error suppression .",
    "some of these extensions were presented in @xcite , and in particular they achieved a depolarizing threshold higher than the perfect matching algorithm .",
    "we have also adapted our decoder to other noise models , such as the erasure channel , and other topological codes , in particular the color codes of @xcite .    _",
