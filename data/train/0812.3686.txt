    "the calculation of cross sections in the standard model and its extensions at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory inevitably involves computing virtual loop feynman diagrams . in a process in which 2 partons scatter to produce @xmath3 partons we integrate over the momenta @xmath4 of the @xmath3 final state partons . in a leading order calculation , for each choice of @xmath4 , we multiply the desired measurement function for that point by the squared tree level matrix element evaluated at that point . at next - to - leading order",
    ", we need also the one loop matrix element times the complex conjugate of the tree level matrix element , plus the complex conjugate of this product . the standard method for",
    "this kind of calculation involves computing the one loop matrix element as a whole : for the chosen @xmath4 , we compute the integral that represents the loop graphs , with infrared and ultraviolet subtractions as necessary .",
    "the method for calculating this integral typically involves representing the integral in terms of `` master integrals , '' whose values are known .",
    "there has recently been very significant progress in developing this method @xcite .",
    "there is another possibility .",
    "the loop graph is an integral over a loop momentum @xmath5 .",
    "one can write the integration over @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a single integration , so that for each choice of @xmath4 in a monte carlo style integration , we also choose a momentum @xmath5 . then we multiply the measurement function and the complex conjugate tree amplitude by the _ integrand _ of the loop amplitude evaluated at @xmath6 .",
    "the loop amplitude contains singular factors @xmath7 .",
    "these singularities can be partly avoided by deforming the integration contour into the complex @xmath5 space .",
    "thus one needs to specify what the deformed integration contour is to be .",
    "there are some possible variations on this method . in one variation ,",
    "the integral over the energy @xmath8 is performed analytically by closing the integration contour , leaving a three dimensional integration over @xmath9 . in another variation ,",
    "the loop integral is re - expressed using feynman parameters @xmath10 , so that we have an integration over either @xmath5 and @xmath10 or just @xmath10 .",
    "then we integrate over a complex contour in @xmath10 . in any of these variations ,",
    "the loop integral is evaluated by numerical monte carlo integration along with the integration over @xmath4 , so we may refer to this as the numerical monte carlo method .",
    "the numerical monte carlo method was implemented in ref .",

    "the loop integral is expressed as a three dimensional integration over @xmath9 .",
    "the variant of the numerical monte carlo method in which the loop integral is expressed as an integration over feynman parameters @xmath10 has been successfully implemented in nlo calculations by lazopoulos , melnikov and petriello @xcite for @xmath11 and by lazopoulos , mcelmurry , melnikov and petriello @xcite for @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , anastasiou , beerli and daleo have used this method to compute the two loop amplitudes needed for @xmath13 mediated by a heavy quark or a scalar quark @xcite . in these methods",
    "the infrared singularities are eliminated by the method of sector decomposition @xcite . for the contour deformation in @xmath10 space ,",
    "these authors follow the prescription given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of the present authors explored the numerical monte carlo method using the feynman parameter representation by taking as an example the amplitude for @xmath14 through a ( massless ) electron loop , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nphoton ] . the integral to be evaluate has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the numerator function .",
    "this particular amplitude is useful as a test case because the loop integrand has infrared singularities , but ( for a generic choice of @xmath4 ) these singularities are integrable .",
    "thus infrared subtractions are not needed and one can test the integration method without confronting a subtraction method at the same time . the integral eq .",
    "( [ eq : calm0 ] ) was re - expressed using feynman parameters @xmath10 , giving an integral with the form @xmath17^{n+1 } } \\\\&\\times \\int_{c}d x\\ ,   \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x^i\\right)^{\\!\\!n-3}\\      \\frac{n(l(x,\\ell))}{\\big[\\lambda^{2}(x)\\big]^{n-1 } } \\;\\ ; , \\label{eq : lxspacedeformed } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a translated and wick rotated loop momentum , @xmath19 is the euclidian square of @xmath18 , and @xmath20 is a quadratic function of the feynman parameters @xmath10 .",
    "the feynman parameters are integrated over a certain deformed contour @xmath21 .",
    "although the numerical monte carlo integral ( [ eq : lxspacedeformed ] ) is guaranteed to converge as the number of integration points becomes arbitrarily large , it needed to be proved that the method could produce the right answer with a practical number of integration points .",
    "for this reason @xmath22 was evaluated at specified points @xmath4 by numerical monte carlo integration .",
    "the practicality test showed that one could obtain results for @xmath23 .",
    "for some helicity choices , the six gluon amplitude was known analytically @xcite and the numerical results agreed with the analytical answer . for other helicity choices ,",
    "the results have been confirmed by independent analytical calculations by binoth , heinrich , gehrmann and mastrolia @xcite and by ossola , papadopoulos and pittau @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we ask whether one could use monte carlo numerical integration to perform the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : calm0 ] ) directly , without transforming the integral into the feynman parameter form ( [ eq : lxspacedeformed ] ) . in a practical application for which infrared subtractions are needed , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , one would lose the possibility of constructing the subtractions with the sector decomposition method . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known @xcite how to construct the subtractions directly in momentum space in a fashion that is analogous to that used for real emission diagrams . if one were to perform the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : calm0 ] ) directly , there would be a certain advantage of simplicity .",
    "additionally , one would avoid having a denominator @xmath24 raised to a high power , which can create numerical convergence difficulties .",
    "the real apparent advantage of the feynman parameter integration is that @xmath24 is simply a quadratic function of @xmath10 , so that it is easy to find a contour deformation that keeps us away from the zeros of the denominator . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : calm0 ] ) , the denominator is a product of factors , each of which vanishes on a different surface in @xmath5 space .",
    "for this reason , it is not immediately evident how to deform the integration contour in @xmath5 . in the subsequent sections , we lay out a contour deformation with the required properties .",
    "we then apply the same practicality test that was used for the form ( [ eq : lxspacedeformed ] ) .",
    "we find that the direct form ( [ eq : calm0 ] ) gives us somewhat better numerical convergence than does the feynman parameter form ( [ eq : lxspacedeformed ] ) .",
    "we do not know if the direct form is better in real applications .",
    "indeed , it may well prove more useful to use the style of calculation in which the integral @xmath22 is evaluated as a whole in terms of master integrals .",
    "alternatively , it may be that one method is better for some applications while other methods work better in other applications .",
    "we offer a method for performing the integral ( [ eq : calm0 ] ) directly in this paper in order to extend the range of available choices .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : calm0 ] ) has singularities on the surfaces @xmath25 . in order to avoid these singularities",
    ", we can deform the integration contour so that the loop momentum has an imaginary part .",

    "the integral is @xmath31 in moving the integration contour we make use of the multidimensional version of the widely used one dimensional contour integration formula . a simple proof is given in the second paper of ref .",
    "the essence of the theorem is that we can move the integration contour as long as we start in the direction indicated by the @xmath32 prescription and do not encounter any singularities of the integrand along the way .    in order to see what is required for the deformation",
    ", we consider a family of deformations , specified by @xmath33 we imagine starting with an infinitesimal @xmath34 and then increasing it to its final value , @xmath35 .",
    "thus we consider @xmath36 .",
    "the denominator corresponding to propagator @xmath37 is @xmath38 our first requirement is that we start the deformation in the direction specified by the @xmath32 prescription .",
    "this means that on any of the of the surfaces @xmath25 we have @xmath39 .",
    "consider a a point @xmath5 on the cone @xmath25 .",
    "the condition @xmath40 has a simple geometrical interpretation : that @xmath41 points toward the interior of the cone . to see this",
    ", we consider the point @xmath42 , where @xmath34 is infinitesimal and positive .",
    "points on the interior of the cone have @xmath43 .",
    "expanding to first order in @xmath34 and using @xmath25 , we have @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , the condition @xmath45 has the geometrical interpretation that @xmath41 is tangent to the cone .",
    "we want to escape from the singularities if we can .",
    "this means that on @xmath25 we would like @xmath40 .",
    "this is easy as long as there is only one cone involved .",
    "we simply need to find a vector @xmath46 that points toward the interior of the cone .",
    "no deformation is possible for the point @xmath47 . we can not have @xmath40 if @xmath48 .",
    "thus the point @xmath47 is a pinch singularity , meaning that we can not deform the contour to get away from it .    at the intersection of two cones , deforming the contour",
    "is a little more subtle .",
    "consider two cones @xmath25 and @xmath49 and suppose that @xmath50 is a timelike vector . on the intersection of these two cones",
    ", we need a vector @xmath41 that points towards the interior of both cones .",
    "it is geometrically evident that this is possible .",
    "if @xmath51 is a spacelike vector , we also need a vector @xmath41 that points towards the interior of both cones .",
    "it is also geometrically evident that this is possible .",
    "if @xmath50 is a lightlike vector , the cones meet along a line @xmath52 . if @xmath53 or @xmath54 , the inside of one of the cones is inside of the other , so that there is a range of vectors @xmath41 that point toward the interior of both cones .",
    "however if @xmath55 , the inside of one cone is outside of the other , so that there is no vector @xmath41 that points toward the interior of both cones .",
    "specifically , for @xmath56 with @xmath57 , we need @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the best that we can do is have @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 , this is possible with @xmath62 . thus the contour is pinched : we can deform along @xmath51 , but not in any other direction . with this deformation , we do not escape from the singularity .",
    "this pinch singularity is called the collinear singularity .",
    "in the subsequent sections , we define a contour deformation quite precisely . in this section",
    ", we provide an informal statement of the main idea .",
    "consider two cones @xmath25 and @xmath49 and suppose that @xmath50 is a timelike vector with @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 the coefficient @xmath65 is a non - negative function of @xmath5 .",
    "we want @xmath66 on the surface @xmath67 .",
    "but @xmath68 so this requirement is automatically met .",
    "we also want @xmath69 on the surface @xmath70 .",
    "there are two cases to consider . for the backward light cone from @xmath71",
    ", we simply note that the point @xmath72 lies inside this backward light cone .",
    "thus for @xmath5 on the backward light cone from @xmath71 , @xmath46 points to the interior of this light cone and @xmath73 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] . for the forward light cone from @xmath71 , @xmath46 points in the wrong direction if @xmath74 .",
    "however , we can have @xmath75 by taking @xmath76 on the forward light cone from @xmath71 .",
    "this construction also works if @xmath51 is lightlike with @xmath63 .",
    "the only difference is that now the point @xmath47 lies _ on _ the backward light cone from @xmath71 .",
    "this means that @xmath73 on the backward light cone from @xmath71 except along the line from @xmath72 to @xmath71 , where @xmath75 .",
    "that is , we escape from the singularity everywhere except along the collinear pinch singular line .",

    "[ fig : cones2 ] .",
    "we see that the contour deformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : idea ] ) achieves @xmath77 on @xmath70 and @xmath78 on @xmath67 .",
    "what we need is to replace the @xmath79 signs by @xmath80 signs on the light cones except where the contour is pinched .",
    "we can achieve this by including several terms of the form suggested by eq .",

    "we attack this simple problem because infrared counter terms are not needed : the original integral is infrared finite .",
    "the propagator denominators provide factors that would lead to logarithmic divergences after integration over the soft and collinear regions .",
    "however , these divergences are cancelled . for each electron line",
    "there is a factor @xmath86 .",

    "<S> one approach to the calculation of cross sections for infrared - safe observables in high energy collisions at next - to - leading order is to perform all of the integrations , including the virtual loop integration , by monte carlo numerical integration . in a previous paper , </S>",
    "<S> two of us have shown how one can perform such a virtual loop integration numerically after first introducing a feynman parameter representation . in this paper , we perform the integration directly , without introducing feynman parameters , after suitably deforming the integration contour . our example is the @xmath0-photon scattering amplitude with a massless electron loop . </S>",
