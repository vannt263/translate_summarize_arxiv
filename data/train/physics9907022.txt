    "weakly bound atomic and molecular clusters represent an interesting and growing field of research in both chemistry and physics  @xcite .",
    "they are useful to understand the evolution of the properties from microscopic systems to bulk matter .",
    "moreover , they generate alluring questions whose answers are not trivial due to the important interplay between dynamical and geometrical factors in the cluster description  @xcite . among the most studied systems ,",
    "rare gas clusters possess a rich and intriguing set of properties directly related to the weakness of the interaction between their costituent atoms  @xcite .",
    "the shallow well of their interaction potential energy surface ( pes ) allows the rare gas atoms in a cluster to have large amplitude vibrational motions , therefore sampling all the features of the pes itself , and precluding the use of the usual harmonic approximation to describe their vibrational energy levels  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the clusters of the lightest rare gases undergo a solid - liquid transition at temperatures of the order of few kelvins , so they represent good candidates as a medium where reactions can take place , allowing to study and develop low temperature chemistry . unfortunately , a direct spectroscopic study of the droplets of rare gases to acquire accurate information about their internal dynamics is not easy to carry out , due to the absence of any chromophoric unit  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , molecular beam experiments generate a to low concentration of small clusters to allow neutron scattering studies of the internal structure .",
    "recently , after the discovery that rare gas clusters can easily pick up one or more atomic and molecular impurities  @xcite , attention has been paid to study the effect of the impurity on the cluster and _ vice versa _  @xcite .",
    "these studies focused especially on the spectroscopic properties of the impurity in the cluster medium , as a tool to probe the dynamics of the cluster itself .",
    "the necessity to supplement the experimental spectroscopic results with an interpretation of the measured properties has recently renewed the theoretical interest on these species .",
    "the test of the accuracy of the available pes describing the interaction between the various atoms and molecules , and the calculation of the effect on the measured spectroscopic quantities of the increase of the dimension of the cluster ( i.e. the number of rare gas atoms ) are the most frequent computational studies  @xcite .    among the rare gas atoms",
    ", @xmath0he owes its importance to the strong quantum features it displays in clusters and in liquid bulk at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "these features are responsible for the macroscopic superfluid behavior of @xmath0he , that manifests itself in the total absence of viscosity and in the ability to quickly transport the heat from a source to the surronding matter  @xcite . a recent experiment on the ocs molecule absorbed in small @xmath0he clusters",
    "has definitively shown that superfluidity can be found even in microscopic aggregates , putting to an end a long debate  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the low temperature of these clusters can help spectroscopic studies on large molecules : the electronic spectra of the aminoacids tryptophan and tyrosine were simplified by cooling their vibrational motion inside an @xmath0he droplet  @xcite , llowing an easier interpretation of the experimental results . while alkali and alkali - earth atoms are adsorbed on @xmath0he clusters and then investigated by electronic spectra  @xcite , all other impurities , studied by means of infra - red spectroscopy , reside inside the clusters themselves  @xcite , and strongly perturbate their structure and properties .",
    "this difference is due to the weaker or stronger interactions between the helium atom and the doping molecule than between two helium atoms .",
    "different information on the total dynamics of these aggregates could be extracted if the impurity pertubates only slightly the cluster , or even if , when attached to the droplet , it generates a system whose global properties can be studied by means of microwave or infra - red techniques .",
    "recently , a high accuracy pes for the helium - hydride ion interaction has become available  @xcite : the main features of this interaction potential are the small depth ( about 4 @xmath5 ) , and the large value of the distance where the minimum is located ( about 13 bohr ) .",
    "these features show themselves in the wide amplitude motion of the dimer ( the mean value for the @xmath0he - h@xmath1 distance is about 22 bohr ) , and in the long tail of the vibrational ground state wave function .",
    "an interesting property of this quantum system is given by the existence of an excited rotational state with j=1  @xcite .",
    "the weak interaction between he and h@xmath1 makes the hydride anion a good candidate for studies on the he clusters weakly perturbed by an impurity . due to the presence of a negative charge that is able to polarize the helium atom ,",
    "this system should have a finite dipole moment , hence to be microwave active .",
    "moreover , because of the small mass difference between @xmath0he and h@xmath1 , the spectroscopic techniques should probe the quantum motion of the whole system .",
    "this could be the case also for clusters containing more helium atoms , allowing , as stated before , to collect different information about the quantum dynamics of these aggregates .",
    "in this work we studied both the energetics and structures of the ground state of the @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 clusters using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods . during the last few years",
    ", these methods have been proved to give quite accurate information even for highly quantum systems like helium clusters  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this study is to obtain a clear picture of the relative motion and distribution between the @xmath0he and the h@xmath1 species , with a special emphasis on the location of the h@xmath1 impurity with respect to the @xmath0he@xmath3 moiety .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains the description of the theoretical approach , of the interaction potentials used and few comments about the monte carlo simulations .",
    "section iii contains the discussion of the monte carlo results , while section iv reports our conclusions and possible future directions of this study .",
    "in atomic units , the hamiltonian operator for any @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 clusters containing n @xmath0he atoms and one h@xmath1 ion is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the interaction potential and @xmath8 is a point in configuration space . here",
    ", we assume a pair potential of the form    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the distance between the i - th and j - th helium atom , while @xmath11 is the distance between the i - th helium atom and the hydride ion . in this work ,",
    "for @xmath12 we employ the recent tang - toennies - yiu ( tty ) pair potential  @xcite that is not based on any kind of empirical information .",
    "this choice allows us to directly compare our results with the recent ones obtained by lewerenz  @xcite , who used this pair potential to compute energetics and structure of various small @xmath0he@xmath3 clusters . to obtain the pair potential between he and",
    "h@xmath1 we fitted the accurate full ci results by bendazzoli , evangelisti and passarini  @xcite employing an analytical form tailored to approximate with similar accuracy all the three regions of the potential energy curve :    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    this approach differs from the one used by bendazzoli _",
    "_ in their work , since they chose to interpolate their data using exponential splines instead of fitting them with any analytical model .",
    "to fit the 19 computed values of the interaction potential with our analytical model , we used the levenberg - marquard algorithm , imposing analytically the continuity between the functions at 10 and 20 bohr .",
    "the parameters obtained by means of this procedure are ( in atomic units ) : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "figure 1 shows both the fitted @xmath25 and the tty @xmath26 potentials . from fig . 1",
    ", one can note that the two potentials have quite different well depth and location of the minimum : these results can be explained remembering that h@xmath1 is very diffuse , and that for this reason the attractive charge - induced dipole interaction can occur only for large internuclear separation .",
    "therefore , the well depth should be in principle quite small . in this work",
    "we do not introduce any kind of information about three - body forces : while for pure helium clusters one can use the standard axilrod - teller term  @xcite to augment the pair potential approximation , to our knowledge similar information are not available for the @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 trimer .    to approximate the ground state wave functions for these systems , we employed the commonly used pair product form  @xcite    @xmath27    and no one - body part was used .",
    "this fact guarantees that we do not introduce any center - of - mass kinetic energy component in the description of the cluster , avoiding us the burden of subtracting it to obtain the internal energy of the system .",
    "both the @xmath28 and @xmath29 functions have the same analytical form    @xmath30\\ ] ]    this form is identical to the one employed by rick , lynch and doll  @xcite except for the presence of the new term @xmath31 that was previously used by barnett and whaley  @xcite in their study of helium clusters . during the preliminary stages of our work ,",
    "this term was found to improve sensibly the variational energy of the wave function , and to have a positive impact on the stability of the optimization .",
    "the chosen form for the trial wave function makes impossible to compute analytically the matrix elements of the hamiltonian operator , and numerical methods must be used to obtain the energy and other mean values for a given trial wave function .",
    "the variational monte carlo method is well suited for this goal since it requires only the evaluation of the trial wave function , its gradient , and its laplacian .",
    "since this and other monte carlo methods are well described in the literature  @xcite , we refer the reader to it and to our previous work in this field for the details .",
    "however , it is relevant to point out that all the mean values were computed by means of the general integral    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    and @xmath34 for vmc , while @xmath35 for dmc . in vmc calculations , eq .",
    "[ cluseq5 ] gives exactly the expectation values of the @xmath36 operator over the trial wave function @xmath37 , while in dmc simulations eq .",
    "[ cluseq5 ] gives only an improved estimate of the value , but not the exact one .",
    "this is true for all the @xmath36 operators that do not commute with the hamiltonian .    as to our general strategy to optimize the trial wave functions for the clusters studied",
    ", we usually select the parameters of the exponential part in eq .",
    "[ cluseq4 ] by minimizing the estimate of the variance of the local energy over a fixed sample of walkers    @xmath38 ^ 2\\ ] ]    all the vmc optimizations , and the vmc and dmc simulations were carried out using at least 5000 walkers ; all the dmc simulations were run employing a time step of 200 hartree@xmath39 and the accuracy of the results was checked running few more simulations with smaller time steps to ensure that the time step bias was negligible for all the expectation values .",
    "the wave functions are available from the authors upon request .",
    "in order to check our code , we carried out dmc simulations on the small systems @xmath0he@xmath2 , @xmath0he@xmath40 and @xmath0he@xmath41 employing the parameter listed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the trial wave functions .",
    "our dmc results , -0.00089(1 ) @xmath5 for @xmath0he@xmath2 , -0.08784(7 ) @xmath5 for @xmath0he@xmath40 and -0.3886(1 ) @xmath5 for @xmath0he@xmath41 , are in optimal agreement with the results obtained by lewerenz in ref .",
    "@xcite . as far as @xmath0heh@xmath1 is concerned , we optimized a wave function of the form of eq .",
    "[ cluseq4 ] obtaining -0.36987(8 ) @xmath5 as mean energy . using this trial wave function",
    "we obtained a dmc energy of -0.3969(4 ) @xmath5 , that appears to be in good agreement with the result of -0.4000 @xmath5 obtained by bendazzoli _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the j=0 case .",
    "the remaining small discrepancy is due to the different method we used to obtain an analytical representation of the interaction potential , and show the accuracy of the fitted potential .",
    "these results allow a first comparison between @xmath0he@xmath2 and @xmath0heh@xmath1 : although the well depth of the interaction potential energy between two helium atoms is almost twice the well depth of the heh@xmath1 potential , and the reduced mass of @xmath0heh@xmath1 is smaller than the one of @xmath0he@xmath2 , the total energies differ by more than two orders of magnitude favoring the stability of @xmath0heh@xmath1 .",
    "this outcome can be explained noticing that the heh@xmath1 potential has a longer asymptotic decay and a shallower well than the he@xmath2 potential .",
    "these features reflect themselves in a narrower wave function and a smaller mean distance between @xmath0he and h@xmath1 than between @xmath0he and @xmath0he .",
    "having tested our code , we optimized a trial wave function for the smallest cluster @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 starting from the parameters of the wave functions of the two dimers @xmath0he@xmath2 and @xmath0heh@xmath1 .",
    "since this initial wave function was a crude approximation to the ground state , instead of using a vmc distribution of walkers to carry out the parameter optimization , we employed a dmc simulation to select the configurations .",
    "this alternative way , although seldom used , has the advantage to push the distribution towards the correct one , biasing the selection of the parameters of the trial wave function toward better ones .",
    "after a couple of optimization steps using the dmc distributions , the wave function parameters had roughly converged , allowing us to use vmc simulations to compute mean values and to select the new configurations to carry out the optimization procedure itself for this small system .",
    "for all the @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 systems with @xmath42 the wave function optimization was started using the parameters of the cluster having one helium atom less .",
    "we found this choice to be a good initial guess for the minimization procedure and a good distribution to select the set of configurations by means of a vmc simulation .",
    "the vmc results obtained by means of the optimization of the trial wave function for the @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 are shown in table i [ tab1 ] .",
    "since our trial wave functions are only an approximation of the true ground state functions and allow to compute only approximate properties of these clusters , to project out all the remaining excited state contributions we employed dmc simulations to sample the distribution @xmath43 .",
    "the dmc energy and potential mean values are shown in table i [ tab1 ] together with the vmc results . comparing dmc and vmc energy results",
    ", one can note that the percentage of total energy recovered by the vmc wave functions decreases in monotonic fashion , starting from 96% for the n@xmath44 cluster and ending to 81% for the largest cluster n=12 studied in this work . at present , we are not able to include any definitive explanation of this behaviour , but we feel that it could be due either to the limitation of the model function itself or to the optimization procedure based on the variance of the local energy , or both .    differently from what has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the pure helium clusters , energies and other mean values for the @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 systems converged quite easily even for the smallest clusters with @xmath45 .    from the results shown in table",
    "i [ tab1 ] , supplemented with the dmc results by lewerenz on pure helium clusters , one can compute various interesting energetic quantities :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 represents the energy that is released exchanging an helium atom with the hydride ion , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the energes that are released adding an @xmath0he to an already formed @xmath0he@xmath50h@xmath1 cluster or @xmath0he@xmath50 cluster respectively , while @xmath51 is the binding energy of h@xmath1 to the @xmath0he@xmath3 cluster .",
    "these quantities are shown in figures 2 and 3 to allow a quick comparison , together with the total energy and @xmath52 for the pure helium clusters obtained by lewerenz .",
    "we supplemented his results with the total energy for @xmath0he@xmath53 ( -7.288(3 ) @xmath5 ) , @xmath0he@xmath54 ( -8.746(7 ) @xmath5 ) , @xmath0he@xmath55 ( -10.299(4 ) @xmath5 ) computed in this study .    similarly to the results obtained by barnett and whaley  @xcite in their work on helium clusters containing an hydrogen molecule as impurity , from figure 2 and 3 it is possible to note that the energetics of these small @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 clusters is dominated by the presence of the h@xmath1 ion .",
    "the total energy of the @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 appears to be much lower than the energy of @xmath0he@xmath3 . for the clusters we studied , both @xmath51 and @xmath52 increase almost linearly with the number of helium atoms",
    "this is an expected result for @xmath52 since , if no three - body contribution to the potential energy is present , the total energy of a cluster should be roughly proportional to the number of pairs present .",
    "as far as @xmath51 is concerned , its almost linear behavior can not be explained by means of a similar reasoning ; this outcome could be easily rationalised if h@xmath1 were solvated by the he atoms .",
    "unfortunatly this appears to be hardly possible , due to the quite different well minimum location of the two potentials .    to obtain information about the structure of doped clusters , during the dmc simulations we collected the radial distribution @xmath56 from the center of mass for both @xmath0he and h@xmath1    @xmath57    and from the geometrical center of the cluster @xmath58    figure 4 and 5 display the results for @xmath56 respect to the geometrical center ; these are normalized such that    @xmath59    for the helium atoms , while    @xmath60    for the h@xmath1 ion .",
    "we chose to show only @xmath56 with respect to the geometrical center , since the same quantity computed with respect to the center of mass does not introduce any new information .    comparing the he radial density distributions shown in figure 4 with the same profiles obtained by lewerenz  @xcite",
    ", it is possible to note that they appear quite similar except for our three - body cluster , i.e. @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 .",
    "the he density distribution for this cluster shows a maximum around 5.30 bohr , but there is no trace of the rise of the density for small distances from the center that can be seen in the case of @xmath0he@xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , the plot of figure 4 shows that he can occupy the geometrical center position , i.e. @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 in its ground state can be found in the linear geometry where the h@xmath1 ion is external to the @xmath0he@xmath2 moiety . increasing the number of he atoms present in the cluster , the density near the cluster center rises toward the bulk value , represented in figure 4 by the horizontal dotted line .",
    "similarly to the pure he clusters , the helium atoms appear to be completely delocalized with no indication of any shell filling structure .    from the h@xmath1 density distributions shown in figure 5",
    ", one can note the peaked distribution of the impurity with respect to the shallower profile of the he atoms , and that , upon increasing the number of helium atoms in the cluster , the h@xmath1 is pushed toward larger distances from the center .",
    "moreover , figure 5 shows that the penetration of h@xmath1 decreases in a fairly monotonic fashion .",
    "the only exception to this behavior is the smallest cluster @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 : its distribution shows a rise beyond statistical fluctuation for a distance from the center less than the minimum located around 4.1 bohr .",
    "this result indicates that in the @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 cluster the linear geometry where h@xmath1 lies between the he atoms plays a significant role in the description of the total motion , although h@xmath1 has a larger probability to lie 10 bohr far from the center of the cluster . concluding , except for the smallest cluster of the series , the impurity is not solvated by the @xmath0he atoms , having a small probability to be found near the center of the cluster .",
    "analogous conclusions can be obtained by the density distributions computed respect to the center of mass of the cluster .",
    "the pair distribution functions @xmath61 of the @xmath0he-@xmath0he and @xmath0he - h@xmath1 distances are shown in figures 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "these distributions are normalized such that @xmath62 .",
    "again , the he - he distribution has many similarities with the same quantity computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing a short range structure given by the sharp boundary hole around each he atom and a long decaying tail for large distances .",
    "moreover , for n@xmath63 , our pair distributions show a weak shoulder around 12 - 13 bohr ; the onset of this peculiarity of the he - he pair distribution was already noted by barnett and whaley  @xcite for @xmath0he@xmath55 and @xmath0he@xmath64 in their work and explained by means of the appearence of the second - nearest - neighbor coordination shell .",
    "this can not be the case for our n=10 - 12 clusters , where the icosahedral shell filling is not even completed .",
    "a similar feature seems to appear for @xmath0he@xmath65 in the pair distribution shown by lewerenz in his work on pure clusters  @xcite .",
    "we interpret this feature as due to the presence of a light residual of an almost icosahedral structure of the clusters , i.e. an @xmath0he does not have only first neighbors .",
    "moreover , we suspect this trait to be emphasized by the light deformation of the @xmath0he@xmath3 moiety distribution due to the impurity resident on its surface . the presence of this deformation for all the studied clusters is supported by the almost linear behavior of e@xmath66 shown in figure 2 , and by the fact that only small changes take place in the form of the he - h@xmath1 distributions ( figure 7 ) upon increasing of the number of atoms in the clusters .    from the sampled density and pair distributions , displayed in figures 4 - 7 ,",
    "various mean distances can be computed by simple one dimensional integration . in table ii",
    "[ tab2 ] , we report the values for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . comparing our @xmath68 and @xmath69 results with the mean values computed by lewerenz for the clusters containing the same total number of particles ,",
    "we note that our doped clusters have a more compact structure of the @xmath0he atom moiety than the pure ones , certainly due to the presence of the strongly binding impurity .",
    "both mean distances show a sharp decrease up to n=5 where a minimum is located , and a light increase going toward larger n. this behavior can be explained easily by means of standard arguments : going from n=2 to n=5 the mean interaction between the particles increases due to their increased number , giving rise to a stronger binding between them . for n greater than 5",
    "the cluster becomes larger due to the addition of another @xmath0he atom , in spite of the augmented total interaction energy .",
    "a similar behavior is displayed by the @xmath67 mean values , and it can be rationalized by means of the same arguments .    as far as @xmath70 is concerned , its monotonic increase going toward larger n can be explained by the joined effect of the increased dimension of the @xmath0he atoms moiety and of the displacement of the center of mass location inside the moiety itself , due to a simple mass effect .",
    "in this work we presented the first quantum - mechanical study of an anionic impurity in @xmath0he clusters .",
    "our results show the h@xmath1 ion to be located on the surface of the cluster , except for the @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 cluster where it has a finite probability to be found between the two he atoms in a linear geometry .",
    "our total energy values show that the interaction between helium and the impurity is an important component of the total energy of the system , while our mean geometrical values show that the helium moiety is slightly contracted with respect to the pure cluster case .",
    "we consider this fact to be due to the form of the interaction potential between an helium atom and the impurity , and especially to its longer tail respect to the he - he potential .",
    "as far as the possibility to record a microwave spectrum of these systems is concerned , the location of the impurity on the cluster surface seems to indicate that this is possible , at least in principle .",
    "in fact , the cluster structures resemble mostly the structure of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule whose lightest atom carries a negative charge , and whose heaviest atom has a farly large radius .    in this work",
    ", we approximated the total interaction potential as a sum of pair components , therefore excluding any non - addictive effect in the description of the systems .",
    "the three - body interaction between two he and one h@xmath1 could play a major role than in the pure he case in defining both energetics and structure of the clusters , due to the fact that it is due to a charge - induced dipole - induced dipole interaction .    moreover , the effects of the isotopic substitution of h@xmath1 with d@xmath1 on the structure and energetics are worth to study , since they were found quite important for heh@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we expect this effect to be especially important for the excited rotational states of these complexes , so we are planning to extend our study in this new direction , i.e. to compute ground state properties for clusters containing d@xmath1 , and rotational excited states for both the doping impurities  @xcite .",

    "<S> we report ground state energies and structural properties for small helium clusters ( @xmath0he ) containing an h@xmath1 impurity computed by means of variational and diffusion monte carlo methods . except for @xmath0he@xmath2h@xmath1 that has a noticeable contribution from collinear geometries where the h@xmath1 impurity lies between the two @xmath0he atoms , </S>",
    "<S> our results show that our @xmath0he@xmath3h@xmath1 clusters have a compact @xmath0he@xmath3 subsystem that binds the h@xmath1 impurity on its surface . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath4 can be interpreted invoking the different features of the minima of the he - he and he - h@xmath1 interaction potentials . </S>"
