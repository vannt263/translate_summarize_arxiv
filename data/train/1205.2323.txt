    "the concept of frames ( discrete frames ) in hilbert spaces has been introduced by duffin and schaeffer @xcite in 1952 to study some deep problems in nonharmonic fourier series .",
    "after the fundamental paper @xcite by daubechies , grossmann and meyer , frame theory began to be widely used , particularly in the more specialized context of wavelet frames and gabor frames .",
    "frames play a fundamental role in signal processing , image and data compression and sampling theory .",
    "they provided an alternative to orthonormal bases , and have the advantage of possessing a certain degree of redundancy .",
    "a discrete frame is a countable family of elements in a separable hilbert space which allows for a stable , not necessarily unique , decomposition of an arbitrary element into an expansion of the frame elements . for more details about discrete frames",
    "see @xcite .",
    "resent results show that frames can provide a universal language in which many fundamental problems in pure mathematics can be formulated : the kadison - singer problem in operator algebras , the bourgain - tzafriri conjecture in banach space theory , paving toeplitz operators in harmonic analysis and many others .",
    "various types of frames have been proposed , for example , @xmath0-frames in banach spaces @xcite , fusion frames @xcite , continuous frames in hilbert space @xcite , continuous frames in hilbert spaces @xcite , continuous @xmath2-frames in hilbert spaces @xcite , @xmath3-operator frames for a banach space @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the concept of bochner @xmath0-frames for banach spaces .",
    "actually , continuous frames motivate us to introduce this kind of frames and analogous to continuous frames which are generalized version of discrete frames , we want to generalize @xmath0-frames in a continuous sense . like continuous frames ,",
    "these frames can be used in those areas that we need generalized frames in a continuous aspect .",
    "also , we define corresponding operators ( synthesis , analysis and frame operators ) and discuss their characteristics and properties . in section 3",
    ", we define a bochner @xmath1-riesz basis and verify its relations by bochner @xmath0-frames .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to perturbation of bochner @xmath0-frames .    throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 will be a banach space and a hilbert space , respectively , and @xmath6 is a family of hilbert spaces .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is a measure space , where @xmath8 is a positive measure .",
    "the following definition introduces bochner measurable functions .",
    "a function @xmath9 is called bochner measurable if there exists a sequence of simple functions @xmath10 such that @xmath11.\\ ] ]    if @xmath8 is a measure on @xmath12 then @xmath4 has the radon - nikodym property with respect to @xmath8 if for every countably additive vector measure @xmath13 on @xmath12 with values in @xmath4 which has bounded variation and is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath8 , there is a bochner integrable function @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for every set @xmath16 .",
    "a banach space @xmath4 has the radon - nikodym property if @xmath4 has the radon - nikodym property with respect to every finite measure .",
    "spaces with radon - nikodym property include separable dual spaces and reflexive spaces , which include , in particular , hilbert spaces .    [ 00 ] suppose that @xmath7 is a measure space and @xmath17 has the radon - nikodym property .",
    "let @xmath18 .",
    "the bochner space of @xmath19 is defined to be the banach space of ( equivalence classes of ) @xmath4-valued bochner measurable functions @xmath20 from @xmath21 to @xmath4 for which the norms @xmath22 @xmath23 are finite . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite it",
    "is proved that if @xmath24 and @xmath25 is such that @xmath26 , then @xmath27 is isometrically isomorphic to @xmath28 if and only if @xmath17 has the radon - nikodym property .",
    "this isometric isomorphism is the mapping @xmath29@xmath30 where the mapping @xmath31 is defined on @xmath19 by @xmath32 so for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 we have @xmath35 in the following , we use the notation @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 , so for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath38 particularly , if @xmath5 is a hilbert space then @xmath39 is isometrically isomorphic to @xmath40 .",

    "we will use the following lemma which is proved in @xcite .    [ 0 ] if @xmath50 is a bounded operator from a banach space @xmath4 into a banach space @xmath51 then its adjoint @xmath52 is surjective if and only if @xmath53 has a bounded inverse on @xmath54 .",
    "note that for a collection @xmath55 of hilbert spaces , we can suppose that there exists a hilbert space @xmath56 such that for all @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the direct sum of @xmath55 , see 3.1.5 in @xcite .",
    "bochner spaces are often used in the functional analysis approach to the study of partial differential equations that depend on time , e.g. the heat equation : if the temperature @xmath60 is a scalar function of time and space , one can write @xmath61 to make @xmath62 a function of time , with @xmath63 being a function of space , possibly in some bochner space .",
    "now , we intend to use this space to define a new kind of frames which contain all of continuous and discrete frames , in other words we will generalize the @xmath2-frames to a continuous case that is constructed on concept of bochner spaces",
    ". of course , this new frame can be useful in function spaces and operator theory to gain some general results that are achieved by @xmath2-frames or discrete frames .",
