    "exactly solvable quantum mechanical models proved to be invaluable tools in the understanding of many fundamental quantum mechanical concepts . in particular , they give insight into complex phenomena , like the symmetries of quantum mechanical systems , and they also allow the investigation of transitions through critical parameter domains @xcite . our goal in this paper is more simple , and analytical solution serves as a firm basis of numerical integration of the radial schroedinger equation .    in this work we consider a very simple case in which a neutral particle is scattered on a spherically symmetric target nucleus represented by a real woods - saxon ( ws ) type @xcite nuclear potential @xmath2 .",
    "the ws potential is the most common phenomenological nuclear potential used in the description of nuclear reactions in the gamow shell model ( gsm ) description @xcite of drip line nuclei .",
    "a recent analysis of this type is the description of the @xmath3be(p,@xmath4)@xmath5b and the @xmath3li(n,@xmath4)@xmath5li reactions in ref .",
    "the key elements of gsm are the berggren - ensembles of single particle states .",
    "the berggren - ensemble might include resonant and sometime anti - bound states beside the bound states and the scattering states along a complex path .",
    "the shape of the path determines the set of the @xmath1-matrix pole states to be included in the ensemble . in order to have smooth contribution from the scattering states the shape of the path should go reasonably far from the poles .",
    "therefore to know , where the poles are located has crucial importance .",
    "the ws potential was introduced long time ago as a smoothed replacement of the square well ( sq ) potential , because the sudden jump of the constant depth of the potential to zero was considered unrealistic in the sq potential .",
    "an introduction of a diffuseness parameter simulated the gradual decrease of the potential value in the surface region of the nucleus .",
    "the only disadvantage of the diffuse potential was that the closed analytical form of the solution of the radial schroedinger equation had to be sacrificed .",
    "more precisely , for zero angular momentum the solution could be calculated analytically but for higher partial waves the equation could be solved without approximation @xcite only by using numerical integration . in this work",
    "we use the opportunity of having both analytic and numeric solutions for the @xmath0 case and compare the distribution of the poles of the scattering matrix @xmath1 for the two types of the potentials .    in section 2 of the paper",
    "we define the poles of the s - matrix on the complex @xmath6-plane for zero angular momentum . in section 3",
    "we give analytical formulae of the @xmath1-matrix for ws and gws potentials . in section 4 and 5",
    "we present the cut - off versions of the potentials ( cws and cgws potentials ) and the numerical methods for calculating the positions of the resonant poles and the normalization of the resonant wave functions . a simple perturbation correction of the cut - off of these potentials is also given in the section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains the results of the numerical examples for heavy and light nuclear systems .",

    "the solution in the asymptotic region is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the poles of @xmath16 for a real potential are either real energy poles ( bound and anti - bound poles ) or complex energy poles .",
    "the real energy poles lie on the imaginary @xmath6-axis .",
    "the complex energy poles are the resonances .",
    "the decaying resonances lie in the fourth quadrant of the @xmath6 plane .",
    "the mirror images of the decaying resonances are the capturing resonances in the third quadrant .",
    "the complex wave number of a decaying ( gamow or gamow - siegert ) resonance is denoted by @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , and by @xmath21 for a capturing resonance . since the energy is proportional to @xmath22 , therefore the unbound poles ( i.e. the anti - bound poles and the resonances ) lie on the second energy - sheet .",
    "we want to study the dependence of the resonant pole positions on the tail of the nuclear potential .",
    "we compare the pole structure of the potentials without any cut and that of the cut - off potentials .",
    "a sq potential is zero beyond its radius but the ws potential becomes zero only at infinity .",
    "it is convenient to write the ws potential as a product of its strength @xmath23 @xmath24 and its radial shape : @xmath25 this shape has two parameters , the radius @xmath26 and the diffuseness @xmath27 . the exponential tail in eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) tends to zero when the radial distance @xmath9 goes to infinity . to calculate scattering cross - sections we need the matrix element of the scattering matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 can be calculated from matching the solution of the radial schroedinger equation to that of the asymptotical solution . for a ws potential",
    "the matching to the asymptotic solutions can be done only at infinite distance .",
    "sometimes we can complement the ws potential with a surface type term with radial shape    @xmath29    and strength @xmath30 and consider the so called generalized ws potential ( gws ) @xmath31    for @xmath0 the solution is given analytically by gy .",

    "( [ ws ] ) corresponds to the sq potential .",
    "poles in the square well potential were studied extensively by nussenzveig @xcite .",
    "he showed , that for @xmath0 the pole trajectories converge to asymptotes with @xmath47 as the depth @xmath48 .",
    "the distance of the consecutive poles is determined basically by the radius of the square well @xmath26 , where the wave function is reflected . for large @xmath49 values",
    "the distance between two consecutive resonant poles : @xmath50 approaches the value of @xmath51 , so we can approximate the @xmath49 dependence of the pole position @xmath43 for large @xmath49 by @xmath52    in the book of r. newton @xcite a similar expression is given for the real parts of the starting values of the @xmath6-trajectories .",
    "the values there were given for so called strictly finite range ( sfr ) potentials vanishing at and beyond @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "for a sq potential the radius @xmath26 and the finite range @xmath53 is the same distance .",
    "the ws or the gws potentials become zero only at infinite distance , therefore they are not sfr type potentials . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that for some types of the sfr potentials the starting points of the pole trajectories ( staring point of a trajectory is a @xmath6 value belonging to very small potential strength @xmath23 ) can be described by a relation : latexmath:[\\[\\label{modkn }    for very small @xmath23 values , we speculate that eq .",
    "( [ modkn ] ) might be valid approximately for realistic values of @xmath23 , too .",
    "therefore after calculating the complex @xmath43 eigenvalues with realistic values of @xmath23 we tried to fit the @xmath55 values by a first order polynomial : @xmath56 the best fit first order polynomial minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences : @xmath57 ^ 2 \\to { \\rm min}~.\\ ] ] from the slope @xmath58 of the best fit polynomial we can deduce a distance @xmath59 based on the relation : @xmath60 since the relation in eq .",

    "the upper value of the index @xmath62 is fixed at a large value .",
    "by cutting off the ws potential or the gws potential to zero at a finite @xmath53 distance we can convert them to sfr potential and solve the radial equation by numerical integration .    at the direct numerical integration",
    "we proceed from the origin @xmath11 step by step to @xmath53 where the nuclear potential becomes zero . at or beyond this distance ,",

    "the value of the cut - off distance becomes more important and the @xmath6 pole position of the cgws potential moves away from the @xmath6 of the gws potential , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ gwscgwsv2200 ] .",
    "the strong dependence on the cut - off distance was noticed earlier by two of us in ref .",
    "@xcite for resonances with @xmath144 .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the cutting the tails of the ws and gws potentials for the resonant poles of the @xmath1-matrix by calculating the pole positions . for zero angular momentum the radial schroedinger equation",
    "is solved by using the analytical formula of gy .",
    "bencze @xcite .",
    "the positions of the poles were calculated with high precision by the program bencze written in wolfram mathematica .",
    "the cut - off versions of the same potentials , the cws and cgws potentials were studied by solving the radial equation numerically by the fortran program jozso @xcite .",
    "pole distributions were studied by exploring the landscape of the modulus of the complex function @xmath86 , which has maxima at the same @xmath6 positions as the @xmath17-matrix .",
    "the maxima of the function supplied us with starting values for finding the accurate positions of the poles . presenting the landscapes of the @xmath145 and",
    "the @xmath146 functions gives an excellent tool to demonstrate the differences of the pole distributions of the potentials without cut and with cut at finite distance . with the absence of the surface term of the gws potential we can study the normal ws and cws potentials and the effect of the cut of their tails .",
    "the pole structure of the ws and the cws potential is basically different as it was pointed out by r. newton @xcite .",
    "the ws and the gws potentials produce one group of poles ( mountain ) similar to that of the square well potential with the same nuclear radius . from the slopes of the first order polynomials",
    "fitted best to the moduli of the @xmath6 eigenvalues a range @xmath59 can be deduced being very close to the nuclear radius parameter @xmath26 . for these potentials",
    "the reflection of the radial wave function takes place at @xmath26 .",
    "the cws and the cgws potentials produce two or three groups of poles ( mountains ) .",
    "they are more visible if in the cgws potential a repulsive surface term is present and we have a potential barrier producing a few narrow resonances .",
    "the positions of the narrow resonances are similar to those of the gws potential , they form a first group of poles in which the distance of the poles are similar to that of the square well potential with radius @xmath26 .    the appearance of the second and sometimes the third group of poles is apparently due to the cut of the cws potential .",
    "the poles in the two different mountains are labelled separately by indexing the order of their @xmath82 values .",
    "the moduli of the @xmath55 values in both mountains can be approximated by first order polynomials as the function of the @xmath49 values . from the @xmath58 slopes of these polynomials",
    "one can derive a sort of distance where reflection of the solution takes place .",
    "we assume that the appearance of the poles for broad resonances is due to reflections at these distances .",
    "reflections take place when the derivative of the potential has sudden change . in a square",
    "well this evidently happen at its radius @xmath26 .",
    "for gws potentials for small values of the diffuseness the derivatives are still large and the wave functions are reflected at the nuclear radius @xmath26 . for a cgws potential",
    "the potential has a jump at the cut - off radius @xmath53 where the derivative does not exist .",
    "this causes a reflection of the wave function at this distance , and the distance of the poles in the first mountain of the diffuse well is influenced by this reflection .",
    "the @xmath59 distances calculated from the slope of the best fit linear polynomials therefore are very close to the value of @xmath53 .    for small diffuseness and for not very large energy the radial wave function",
    "can be reflected at @xmath26 and at @xmath53 as well and oscillations between these two distances produces the third group of poles ( mountain ) .",
    "the effect of cutting off the tail of the potential is too large for the second and the third group of poles and the first order perturbation correction is unable to recover the cut .",
    "the numerical results were performed for two different nuclear systems , the heavy target case for @xmath110pb+n system and for a lighter system for @xmath116fe+n system studied recently by bayrak and aciksoz @xcite .",
    "we observed similar results for the light and the heavy target systems , as far as the reflections of the wave function are concerned and conclude that our results are typical for the nuclear potentials studied .",
