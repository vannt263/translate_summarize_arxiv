    "when there is no limit in the supply of vaccines or when the total number of vaccines used is limited , the optimal vaccination strategy implies a vaccination of 100% of the susceptible population in a very short period of time ( smaller than one day ) . in practice , this is a very difficult task because limitations in the number of vaccines and also in the number of humanitarian and medical teams in the affected regions are common . in this direction ,",

    "to simplify , consider in both cases @xmath141 and @xmath155 .",
    "when we increase the weight constant @xmath47 , the maximum value attained by the optimal control becomes lower than one ( see fig .  [",

    "@xmath141 for @xmath166 , the optimal control starts with the value @xmath167 and is a decreasing function with a cost function @xmath168 . at the end of approximately 3.7 days ,",
    "the control remains equal to zero . for @xmath169 ,",
    "the optimal control starts with the value @xmath170 and is also a decreasing function , with a cost @xmath171 . at the end of 13.5 days",

    "the behavior of the optimal state variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are similar .      from previous results , we observe that when there is no limit on the supply of vaccines , or when the total number of used vaccines is limited , the optimal vaccination strategy implies a vaccination of 100 per cent of the susceptible population in a very short period of time , sometimes smaller than one day .",
    "but we know that in practice this is a very difficult task , since there are limitations in the number of vaccines available and also in the number of health care workers or humanitarian teams in the regions affected by ebola virus with capacity to vaccinate such a big number of individuals almost simultaneously . from this point of view , it is important to study the case where there is a limited supply of vaccines at each instant of time . in this section ,",
    "we consider @xmath122 , a shorter interval of time @xmath40 $ ] , with @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and we assume that at each instant of time there exist only 1000 , 1200 and 900 available vaccines , respectively . from our point of view , these numbers of available vaccines at each instant of time and the number of days considered , correspond to possible real scenarios , which are possible to implement in a concrete endemic region and at the same time characterize lack of human and material resources to vaccinate the susceptible population in a short period of time . from the numerical simulations , for such mixed constraints , the number of cumulative confirmed cases increases with time ( see figure  [ totalinfmixed ] ) . the cost associated with the vaccination campaign , associated with the solution of the optimal control problem with the mixed constraint @xmath175 , @xmath176 $ ] , is equal to @xmath177 .",
    "such solution is the less costly of the three considered , followed by the constraint @xmath178 for @xmath179 $ ] with a cost of @xmath180 .",
    "the most expensive vaccination strategy is the one associated with the mixed constraint @xmath181 , @xmath182 $ ] , with a cost of @xmath183 .",
    "the strategy associated with the constraint @xmath175 is the one where a lowest number of susceptible individuals completely recover through vaccination , with @xmath184 individuals in the class @xmath10 at the end of 10 days .",
    "if we consider that at each instant of time there are 1200 vaccines available during a period of 15 days , then @xmath185 completely recover .",
    "this is the strategy with more individuals in the class @xmath10 .",
    "if we consider 16 days , but only 900 vaccines available for each instant of time , then only @xmath186 individuals completely recover ( see fig .  [ cmixed ] ) .",
    "for all three mixed constraint situations , the number of individuals in the classes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 does not change significantly ( therefore , the figures with these classes are omitted ) .",
    "as the number of available vaccines represent a small percentage of the susceptible population , in the three cases the optimal vaccination strategies for the constraints @xmath178 and @xmath181 suggest that the percentage of the susceptible population that is vaccinated is always inferior than 18 percent . in the case of the constraint @xmath175 ,",
    "this percentage is always inferior to 8 percent ( see fig .",
    "[ controlmixed ] ) .",
    "we assume that , in a near future , an effective vaccine against the ebola virus will be available . under this assumption ,",
    "three different scenarios have been studied : unlimited supply of vaccines ; limited total number of vaccines to be used ; and limited supply of vaccines at each instant of time .",
    "we have solved the optimal control problems analytically and we have performed a number of numerical simulations in the three aforementioned vaccination scenarios .    some authors have already considered the optimal control problem with vaccination for ebola disease , but always with unlimited supply of vaccines @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the solution to this mathematical problem is obvious : the solution consists to vaccinate all susceptible individuals in the beginning of the outbreak .",
    "this is a very particular case of our work , investigated in section  [ sec:6.1 ] ( see figure  [ fig : control : vacc : nolim ] ) .",
    "if vaccines are available without any restriction , then one could completely eradicate ebola in a very short period of time .",
    "these results show the importance of an effective vaccine for ebola virus and the very good results that can be attained if the number of available vaccines satisfy the needs of the population .",
    "unfortunately , such situation is not realistic : in case an effective vaccine for ebola virus will appear , there always will be restrictions on the number of available vaccines as well as constraints on how to inoculate them in a proper way and in a short period of time ; economic problems might also exist .    in our work , for first time in the literature of ebola , an optimal control problem with state and control constraints has been considered .",
    "mathematically , it represents a health public problem of limited total number of vaccines .",
    "the results obtained in section  [ sec:6.2 ] provide useful information on the number of vaccines to be bought , in order to reduce the number of new infections with minimum cost .",
    "for example , the results between 10000 and 20000 vaccines ( in 90 days ) are completely different . with 10000 vaccines",
    ", the number of cumulative infected cases continues to increase , while with 20000 vaccines it is already possible to decrease the new infections .",
    "the optimal solution , in this case , is similar to the case of unlimited supply of vaccines , that is , it implies a vaccination of 100 per cent of the susceptible population in a very short period of time . in practice",
    ", this is an unrealistic task , due to the necessary number of vaccines and humanitarian teams in the regions affected by ebola .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is important to study the case where there is a limited supply of vaccines at each instant of time .",
    "this was investigated in section  [ sec:6.3 ] .",
    "this situation is much richer and the optimal control solution is not obvious . for a given number of available vaccines at each instant of time",
    ", we have a different solution , which is the optimal rate of susceptible individuals that should be vaccinated . in this case",
    ", the optimal control implies the vaccination of a small subset of the susceptible population .",
    "it remains the ethical problem of how to choose the individuals to be vaccinated .",
