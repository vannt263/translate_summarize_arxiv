    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) shows various phases under extreme conditions . at very high temperature and/or density ,",
    "the phase structure can be studied with perturbative approaches . however , it is difficult to study it especially near the critical temperature and/or density directly from qcd , because of the strong coupling .",
    "lattice qcd simulation is one of powerful theoretical tools , but it is not applicable in the finite density region due to the sign problem  @xcite .",
    "the problem in simulations of real - life qcd at finite baryon density produces interest in the two - color qcd with quarks in the fundamental representation  @xcite , the qcd with quarks in the adjoint representation  @xcite , and so on , that are free from the sign problem .",
    "in particular , two - color qcd has some interesting features in the following respect : color - singlet baryons appear together with ordinary mesons as nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and their interactions are determined uniquely by the low - energy theorem .",
    "this allows us to construct low - energy effective theories including the baryons as light degrees of freedom naturally , and to investigate properties of hadrons even at finite baryon density using them .",
    "furthermore , because there are many studies of the lattice qcd simulations , we can make a comparison of results from effective theories with those from the lattice analyses  @xcite .",
    "actually , in two - color qcd , the phase structure at finite baryon number density @xmath6 was studied  @xcite using the chiral lagrangian including the pseudo - ng bosons , having masses of @xmath10 , which are associated with the chiral symmetry breaking of @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown that the phase transition from the symmetric phase of the baryon number @xmath7 to the broken phase takes place at @xmath11 , triggered by the condensation of the baryonic pseudo - ng bosons . there , the density dependences of the masses of pseudo - ng bosons are also studied and it was found that a baryonic boson becomes the massless ng boson in the @xmath7 broken phase .",
    "the density dependences of `` vector '' bosons ( in this paper we call `` vector '' bosons which consist of mesons with @xmath0 and diquark baryons with @xmath1 . ) are studied in the lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the mass of `` @xmath8 '' meson decreases with @xmath6  @xcite , and that the mass of anti - baryon with @xmath12 increases linearly with @xmath6 for @xmath13 while that of baryon decreases linearly  @xcite . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the baryon mass is not yet clearly confirmed .",
    "on the other hand , the behaviors of the masses were also studied in an effective model  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the masses in a general effective model which can include several models with the parameters chosen suitably .",
    "in this paper we construct a low energy effective lagrangian for the two - color qcd including the `` vector '' bosons ( mesons with @xmath0 and diquark baryons with @xmath1 ) in addition to the pseudo - ng bosons ( mesons with @xmath3 and baryons with @xmath4 ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian is composed based on the chiral symmetry breaking pattern of @xmath5 in the framework of the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite , and the `` vector '' bosons are introduced as the gauge bosons of the @xmath15 hls . the hls is equivalent to other models for `` vector '' bosons such as the ccwz matter field  @xcite , the tensor field  @xcite and the massive yang - mills field  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to perform the systematic derivative expansion in the hls  @xcite , which allows us to study the parameter dependences of the masses at finite density in a systematic way .",
    "we study the vacuum structure of the model in the case of @xmath16 using the leading order lagrangian , and show that the flavor - singlet `` @xmath9''-meson carrying @xmath0 has a vacuum expectation value in the time component . as a result ,",
    "the phase structure is the same as the one determined by including only the pseudo - ng bosons  @xcite : for @xmath17 , a baryonic pseudo - ng boson ( @xmath4 state ) condenses , which causes the spontaneous breaking of the baryon number symmetry , @xmath7 . we show that the mass of the anti - baryon ( baryon ) with @xmath12 increases ( decreases ) for @xmath18 and turns to decrease ( increase ) for @xmath17 .",
    "these behaviors signal the phase transition of @xmath7 breaking .",
    "the effect of higher order terms is shown to make @xmath8 and @xmath9 meson masses decrease for @xmath17 consistently with lattice data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons is proportional to the mixing strength between the diquark baryon with @xmath1 and the anti - baryon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : hls ] we construct the chiral lagrangian based on the hls .",
