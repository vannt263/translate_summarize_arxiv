    "contemporary computer systems may be distributed and may consist of many interconnected processing units or a large number of networked computer subsystems .",
    "in addition contemporary digital networks may consist of a large number of end- and intermediate- nodes .",
    "in all these systems , information , in the form of the sequences over some alphabet of symbols , is circulating or being stored . the entity controlling a subsystem or",
    "a node is often unwilling or prohibited to share this information - sequences with other nodes .",
    "however , sharing of some reduced local information might be very useful for purposes of security , stability and various analysis of the system performance , and for data mining .",
    "such analysis might for example allow to identify frequently appearing segments by performing approximate statistical analysis on segment frequency , allowing to detect replicating malicious code - worms .",
    "it also allows to identify segments - markers of computer viral infection , by detecting patterns existing in some database of malicious sequences .",
    "such databases are used e.g. in contemporary intrusion detection systems or spam filters .",
    "it has been shown that being able to perform pattern matching against only fixed - length prefixes or substrings of longer sequences can provide approximate hints as to the presence of suspicious content  @xcite . likewise , established worm detection techniques such as autograph  @xcite or earlybird  @xcite are based on counting frequency of small blocks of a fixed size .",
    "sharing of reduced local information among the members of an interconnected computer system or communication network thus helps to discover attacks earlier .",
    "affected parts may be isolated and further attack spread prevented .",
    "the benefits of sharing local information may be reaped in case of existence of a computational information processing , which preserves local information ( e.g. all segments of certain maximal length ) and makes impossible to reconstruct longer or sensitive parts of the information sequences .",
    "we call such information processing _ concealing_. the systems which conceal information and share the concealed information are likely to possess a competative advantage in the form of robustness , attack resistance and immunity due to ability to exchange , publish and protect information .",
    "clearly , any information concealing algorithm needs to address two conflicting goals :    1 .   preserving _ presence _ and , possibly , _ frequency rank _ of segments of given size ( making spam identification and worm detection still possible ) , while 2 .   making reconstruction of content longer than the predefined limit computationally hard ( e.g. disabling interpretation or understanding of the private content ) .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is    * formulation of the information concealing problem * presentation of an information concealing algorithm * analysis of the algorithm and a proof of the hardness of reconstruction of the input sequence",
    "our inspiration comes from an important feature of eukaryotic dna , namely that it contains various _ repeat families _ , and that their presence constitutes a basic difficulty in dna reconstruction by hybridisation @xcite .    a large proportion of eukaryotic genomes is composed of dna segments that are repeated either precisely or in variant form more than once .",
    "highly repeated segments are arranged in two ways : as tandem arrays or dispersed among many unlinked genomic locations .",
    "as yet , no function has been associated with many of the repeats @xcite . in the paper @xcite which accompanies this paper ,",
    "the authors propose that in eukaryotes the cells have dna as a depositary of concealed genetic information and the genome achieves the self - concealing by accumulation and maintenance of repeats .",
    "the protected information may be shared and this is useful for the development of intercellular communication and in the development of multicellular organisms .",
    "the assertion that the repeats are maintained in dna in a programmed way for self - concealing explains basic puzzling features of repeats : the uniformity along with the polymorphism of the repeated sequences ; the freedom of the repeated dna to adopt quite different primary sequences in closely related species ; apparent non - functionality of the precise amount or the precise sequence of the repeats .",
    "the containment of repeats versus dna sequencing problem is receiving extensive attention of biologists , computer scientists and mathematicians ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we explain the basic idea of concealing by repeats in this subsection .",
    "assume we are given a collection @xmath0 of segments of dna .",
    "each segment @xmath1 from @xmath0 is divided into two parts , the initial part @xmath2 and the terminal part @xmath3 .",
    "we thus may write @xmath4 .",
    "this is an artificial assumption imposed only for the clarity of the presentation .",
    "a _ reconstruction _ of @xmath0 is a sequence of its segments so that the terminal part of each segment agrees with the initial part of next segment in the sequence . if several of these initial and terminal parts coincide , there may be an exponential number of possible reconstructions .",
    "let us consider a very simple example .",
    "let @xmath0 be the following collection of segments , where the initial and the terminal parts are divided by the vertical line : @xmath5 the following sequences are some of the possible reconstructions : @xmath6 in this simple example , even unlimited computational power is useless to anybody who wants to obtain the correct reconstruction from the many possible reconstructions .",
    "this phenomenon may well be described in terms of the de bruin graph : this graph has a node for each segment which is an initial or a terminal part of an element of @xmath0 . for each segment @xmath1 of @xmath0",
    "there is an arrow ( a directed edge ) from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "bg.pstex_t    the possible reconstructions now correspond to the walks on the de bruin graph so that each directed edge is traversed exactly once .",
    "these walks are usually called euler walks",
    ". if a node of the de bruin graph has more than one outgoing incident directed edge , then locally there are several independent ways to traverse these edges .",
    "the number of the euler walks of the de bruin graph is therefore typically exponential in the number of these nodes ( see @xcite for the calculations ) .",
    "the concept of hiding private or sensitive data but preserving some form of structural information has been studied recently in various sub - domains of ict .",
    "some techniques concentrate on hiding the originator of information , i.e. _ anonynimization _ , other focus on enabling particular functions over the data that can be shared among multiple partners , such as _ private matching_.      an anonymization scheme over the network packet",
    "_ ip addresses _ called cryptopan  @xcite preserves the prefix hierarchy of the original addresses , while making them computationally hard to reconstruct by using hashing .",
    "this in turn allows to share network traces ( with packet headers only ) , with preservation of the prefix hierarchy .",
    "similarly , in  @xcite , structure of the router configuration files and data is preserved , while the actual values are obfuscated .    a technique to process and transform the network _ packet payload _ has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this method uses dictionaries of important sequences that are valuable from the data mining perspective and should be preserved , while encrypting the rest of the information with cryptographically strong hash function .",
    "this technique performs well in terms of data protection , however , it only allows to study content portions pre - determined by a known list , and thus does not allow to study the payload to detect previously unknown content , such as e.g. malicious subsequence .",
    "the popular bloom filter  @xcite approach is used in constructing the hierarchical bloom filter _ payload attribution _",
    "technique  @xcite .",
    "a bloom filter can store ( incompletely but efficiently ) input items ( which can be substrings ) and easily answer set membership queries .",
    "it consists of @xmath7 hash functions , each associating one of @xmath8 numbers to each input item .",
    "set membership queries exhibit no false negatives , but can have false positives .",
    "payload attribution with a hierarchical bloom filter stores segments of network packet payloads with their ip source and destination addresses .",
    "each payload is cut into segments @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 s are stored in a bloom filter of level @xmath11 , _ the pairs _",
    "@xmath12 in bloom filter of level @xmath13 , quadruples in level @xmath14 , and so on .",
    "a query on an excerpt of payload , which may consist of several consecutive blocks , may answer the source and destination address by running through consecutive hierarchy levels .    the authors propose deployment at network concentration points .",
    "privacy protection is to be achieved by restricting access of entities that can pose queries , otherwise exhaustive attacks might lead to payload reconstruction .",
    "private matching  @xcite focuses on the problem of two entities trying to find common data elements in their databases , without revealing private information .",
    "the basic property ( and difference to the general information concealing problem ) is that only two parties are involved ; a multiparty solution is a future work suggestion .",
    "further problems are asymmetry in the sequence of information exchange among the parties and needed presumption of honesty ( semihonesty in the paper ) .    private matching is a special case of cryptography theory of _ multi - party computation _ : @xmath8 parties want to compute function @xmath15 on their @xmath8 inputs . in the _ ideal model _ , where a trusted party exists , the parties give their inputs to the trusted authority , it calculates @xmath15 , and returns the result to each party .",
    "the ideal model assumes an ideal situation : for example , no protocol can prevent a party to change its input before the communication is started . a secure multiparty computation protocol _",
    "emulates _ what happens in the ideal model .",
    "paper  @xcite also introduces data ownership certificates to modify the private matching protocols to be unspoofable .",
    "this technique is shown to be useful in a more practical setting to enable privacy - protecting sharing of e - mail white - lists in  @xcite .",
    "various techniques of masking , sanitizing and obfuscating data have been studied to enable test- or third - party development over sensitive databases ( such as the human resources data ) .",
    "after sanitization , the database remains usable - the look - and - feel and some relations and distributions are preserved - but the information content is secure .",
    "the used techniques include masking , shuffling , substitution , number - variance , encryption etc  @xcite .",
    "these techniques share a similar goal with information concealing , but focus on structured data without the need of preserving the local information .      in data mining , anonymization mechanisms ( obfuscating the originator or the private part of the data )",
    "are currently studied intensively .",
    "privacy mechanisms can be classified into several categories , according to where they are deployed during the life cycle of the data .",
    "the mechanism proposed in this paper falls into the category where the individuals trust no one but themselves , and they conceal their respective data before they make them available for sharing .",
    "the existing algorithms in this category  @xcite are called local perturbation ; they are based on different ideas then the concealing procedure proposed in this letter .    in another category , data publishing ,",
    "data are anonymized at a central server ; the individuals are required to trust this server  @xcite .",
    "anonymization in social networks is studied in  @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical foundation for data anonymity and originator protection was laid in  @xcite .",
    "the k - anonymity model for protecting privacy allows holders to release their private data without being distinguishable from at least k-1 other individuals also in the release .",
    "this form of information hiding  @xcite is a related art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one apart from the sender and intended recipient realizes there is a hidden message ; this nowadays includes concealment of digital information within computer files .",
    "comparably , steganalysis is the art of detecting the hidden information .",
    "steganography is a mature science , in particular focussing on the domain of digital rights management ( drm ) , where various watermarking or tamper - proofing techniques may seamlessly embed extra information about the origin of a digital work within itself .",
    "this is a different goal than the proposed information concealing .",
    "while the embedded information may be well concealed and thus very hard to reconstruct , data mining of such information would not be generally possible .",
    "however , it would be very interesting to apply the steganalysis tools to the information concealing attacker problem ( see section  [ sec.concprob ] ) and it certainly belongs among our future work .",
    "the `` attacker problem '' of concealed string reconstruction ( see section  [ sec.concprob ] ) has a strong connection to the problem of information retrieval  @xcite , where probabilistic information about the expected string ( e.g. natural text ) may be used to derive further information or assist text reconstruction .",
    "finally we mention that our first attempt to solve the anonymization problem  @xcite was using random permutations of a collection of short overlapping segments .",
    "this method however by itself doesnot lead to concealing the original data information .",
    "it is shown in this paper that in order to sufficiently extend the families of repeats of the resulting sequence and make the concealing successful , other procedures need to be performed as well .",
    "in particular the overlapping segments containing complete local information need to be prolonged by attaching additional short segments to their beginning and/or their end .",
    "the shuffling permutation also needs to satisfy some properties .",
    "this is described in the rest of the paper .",
    "we introduce formally the information - sequence concealing problem .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the number of symbols ( length ) of sequence @xmath17 .",
    "the _ sequence concealing _ problem is the following : given a sequence @xmath17 and a small positive integer @xmath7 , we want to transform @xmath17 to another sequence @xmath18 so that :    1 .   if @xmath19 is a segment of @xmath17 with @xmath20 , then @xmath19 is a segment of @xmath18 .",
    "it is computationally hard to reconstruct sequence @xmath17 from @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   the length of @xmath18 is linear in @xmath16 .",
    "it is also desirable that with low probability , a segment not in @xmath17 appears in @xmath18 , and that relative frequency ( i.e. , frequency rank ) of segments of @xmath17 of a given length is preserved in @xmath18 .",
    "the precise statement of these two conditions is however strongly application dependent .",
    "given the statement of the information concealing problem , the key issue is how much information about @xmath17 can an attacker deduce from @xmath18 ; let us call this issue the _ attacker problem_.    clearly , the answer to the attacker problem is application - dependent .",
    "if the input sequence @xmath17 is very restrictive , e.g. if a short prefix uniquely determines larger part of @xmath17 and the k - segments of @xmath17 may be distinguished within the larger k - segment superset of @xmath18 , then inevitably large part of input @xmath17 may be reconstructed from @xmath18 . in quite a number of practical situations ( dna sequence , computer program , sound and video trace , text on non - specific topic ) ,",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "moreover , for restrictive input sequences , we can perform preparatory procedures ( as procedure @xmath1 described below ) which make the input sequence less specific .",
    "this partly justifies the following _ consistency assumption _ concerning the attacker problem which we need to make in order to carry the security analysis of the concealing algorithm .",
    "[ p.cons ] the complete input of the attacker problem , i.e. all the useful information an attacker has about @xmath17 , is @xmath18 , the length @xmath16 , the length @xmath7 of the preserved segments and the concealing algorithm used in obtaining @xmath18 .    thus , an attacker may use the list of frequencies of repeats of segments of @xmath18 along with the knowledge of the concealing algorithm to attempt the reconstruction of @xmath17 .",
    "the input of the problem is a sequence over an alphabet .",
    "we first turn it into a cyclic sequence by connecting its beginning and end .",
    "next we describe five procedures which are used in the algorithm .",
    "the basic pattern of all the procedures is the same and may be described as follows : the input is a cyclic sequence @xmath17 .",
    "first , @xmath17 is partitioned into consecutive disjoint _",
    "blocks_. then the terminal part of the preceding block of length @xmath21 ( the _ overlap _ ) is added in front of each block .",
    "the resulting segments contain all the studied local information ; depending on the procedure , these segments will also contain some excess information which is vital in a proposed composition of the procedures which forms our concealing algorithm .",
    "next , a segment called _ dust _ can but neednot be added behind each segment .",
    "the enhanced blocks are called the _",
    "cards_. the last step consists in arranging the cards into the output cyclic sequence @xmath18 .",
    "the first procedure @xmath1 has a preparatory character in the concealing algorithm .",
    "several runs of @xmath1 have the role of breaking the local sequential order in the input sequence .",
    "its input is a cyclic sequence @xmath17 , and it has parameters @xmath23 ; @xmath21 stands for the size of the overlap , @xmath24 is for lower bound of the length of a block , and @xmath25 is for the upper bound of the length of a block .",
    "the procedure @xmath22 is defined by 1.-4 . below .    1 .",
    "we partition ( sometimes we say that we _ cut _ ) @xmath17 into consecutive disjoint _ blocks _ @xmath26 such that the length of each @xmath27 is chosen at random between @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   we add overlap of length @xmath21 in front of each block .",
    "the overlapping segments thus contain all the original sub - segments of length up to @xmath29 .",
    "the blocks enhanced by the overlaps now start and end with the corresponding overlaps . if these were arranged into a cyclic sequence , the overlaps would neighbor .",
    "this may help an attacker in reconstruction . to break the neighborhood relationship of the overlaps , we may add dust ( a randomly chosen segment ) behind each block . adding dust is optional and application dependent .",
    "a natural restriction is that the dust is a segment of the input sequence and that the average length of dust is @xmath30 to match the average length of the segments complementing the overlaps .",
    "however , depending on applications , and the stringency of condition @xmath31 $ ] of the sequence concealing problem , length of dust may be different and the dust need not be a segment of the input sequence .",
    "we arrange the resulting cards randomly into a cyclic sequence .    as an illustration",
    "we perform @xmath1 on an example input sequence :      procedure @xmath32 is as @xmath1 but the overlap is always the whole preceding block - typically exceeding the size needed to preserve the studied local information ( this excess is used in the composition of the procedures forming our concealing algorithm ) . hence ,",
    "if the blocks are @xmath33 then the cards of @xmath34 are @xmath35 .",
    "each @xmath27 appears once as initial segment and once as terminal segment of each card .",
    "hence , the cyclic consecutive order of the cards of @xmath34 may be described by a permutation @xmath36 of @xmath37 ; for further discussions it turns out useful to define such permutation so that it assigns , to each terminal block of a card , the initial block of the next card . by _",
    "permutation of @xmath37 _ we mean a bijection from set @xmath38 onto itself .",
    "if @xmath36 is a permutation then @xmath39 denotes the inverse permutation ( @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 ) .",
    "hence , in our formalism , card @xmath42 is followed by card @xmath43 .",
    "the output of @xmath34 thus always has form @xmath44 for instance , if we have @xmath45 then the cards are @xmath46 and a shuffling which results in sequence @xmath47 is described by permutation @xmath48 .      for our purposes , not all permutations @xmath36 are acceptable ;",
    "let us formally denote by @xmath49 the set of all the _",
    "acceptable permutations_. to define @xmath49 , we first introduce an auxiliary bipartite graph @xmath50 .",
    "[ def.auxg ] graph @xmath50 has vertex - set @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the edge - set of @xmath50 is the union of three disjoint perfect matchings of the vertex - set , namely :    1 .",
    "the perfect matching @xmath54 consisting of the edges @xmath55 .",

    "( of set @xmath64 of all acceptable permutations ) [ def.acc ] permutation @xmath36 is acceptable ( @xmath65 ) if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied :    1 .   the directed graph @xmath60 has a directed eulerian closed walk where the edges of @xmath56 and @xmath58 alternate .",
    "this condition is equivalent to saying that permutation @xmath36 describes a rearrangement of the cards of @xmath34 into a sequence .",
    "2 .   in the auxiliary graph @xmath50 , the union of the perfect matchings",
    "@xmath61 contains many ( at least @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a small constant ) cycles .",
    "this condition is added in order to make the reconstruction of the input sequence hard ; see the sections below .",
    "the following observation about the graph @xmath50 will be used in the analysis of the attacker problem .",
    "[ o.grat ] let @xmath50 be as in definition [ def.auxg ] . for @xmath68 let @xmath69 be its associated segment .",
    "then we have the following equality between cyclic sequences : @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the vertex of @xmath62 connected with @xmath72 by an edge of @xmath56 .    for illustration",
    "we perform @xmath34 on the output sequence of the previous example ( which would be the natural use of @xmath34 , as described later ) :      if the input of the procedure @xmath34 comes from several runs of the preparatory procedure @xmath1 described above , then we need to modify @xmath34 in order to make its output generic , that is to intentionally preserve the attacker - confusing overlaps .",
    "this modified procedure is called @xmath74 .",
    "we recall that @xmath34 repeats the whole blocks @xmath27 , i.e. the output of @xmath34 is the cyclic sequence @xmath44    we assume that the input @xmath17 of @xmath74 comes from repeated runs of procedure @xmath1 and so @xmath17 contains a lot of segments of length @xmath21 ( the overlaps of runs of @xmath1 ) repeated at least twice ; let us denote by @xmath75 the set of all these segments .",
    "procedure @xmath74 starts as @xmath34 by partitioning of @xmath17 into blocks @xmath76 the blocks of @xmath74 cut some of the segments from @xmath75 . to reflect this , we write @xmath77 where    * segment @xmath78 is an empty segment or a terminal segment of an element of @xmath75 cut by the partition between blocks @xmath79 and @xmath27 .",

    ", we change each such @xmath86 into @xmath87 where @xmath88 is obtained from @xmath89 by adding a segment so that @xmath88 has length @xmath21 and is repeated elsewhere in @xmath17 .",
    "summarising , the output of @xmath74 has form @xmath90 where each @xmath91 stands for a segment of length @xmath21 which is repeated ( at least ) twice in this output , or the empty string . more specifically ,",
    "if @xmath91 follows segment @xmath92 then it is equal to @xmath83 or to @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be as follows : we assume its input is an output of @xmath34 , i.e. it is the cyclic sequence @xmath44 note that in this sequence , each block @xmath27 appears twice .",

    "the trick of the concealing algorithm is that _ both copies of each @xmath27 are cut in the same way ! _ let @xmath99 denote @xmath100 with the added overlap .    for example , if @xmath27 is equal to abcdefghijkl and @xmath101 then a possible cut of @xmath95 is abcde@xmath102fghijkl ; @xmath97 is equal to abcde , @xmath100 is equal to fghijkl and @xmath99 is equal to cdefghijkl.    we may describe the set of the cards of @xmath95 as the _ disjoint _ union of two sets @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105    we remark here that the cards of @xmath106 correspond to the edges of perfect matching @xmath56 of graph @xmath50 and the cards of @xmath107 correspond to the edges of perfect matching @xmath58 of @xmath50 ( see definition [ def.auxg ] ) .",

    "this procedure is defined analogously as @xmath95 with the only difference that the _ cuts _ are performed to segments @xmath92 instead of segments @xmath27 .",
    "let the input string be @xmath17 , and the length of the preserved segments be @xmath7 .",
    "we consider two scenarios , _ weak concealing _ and _ strong concealing _ , depending on the nature of the input .",
    "we perform the _ weak concealing algorithm _",
    "if the input is nonspecific , i.e. , short segments have many possible alternative prolongations , or there does not exist any outside knowledge about the likelihood of presence of some segments in the input ( e.g. an english text ) .",

    "the _ strong concealing algorithm _ may be written as    @xmath110 where the number of repetitions of procedure @xmath1 is application specific .",
    "[ o.kpres ] the concealing algorithm preserves all segments of length @xmath7 present in the input sequence @xmath17 within the output sequence @xmath18 .",
    "this observation is straightforward as whenever any of the above procedures cuts the input string , an overlap of length at least @xmath111 is added in front of the segment following the cut , thus preserving all subsegments of length @xmath7 which would otherwise be partitioned by the cut .",
    "it is also straightforward that both weak and strong concealing algorithms are linear in @xmath16 if we have    * access to a generator of random permutations of the numbers less than @xmath16 , * access to a generator of random elements of @xmath64 ( see definition [ def.acc ] ) .",

    "the attacker wants to overlap these marked segments . depending on whether _ @xmath18 has accidental repeats _ , the attacker possibly _ cuts _ in more places than were the original cards used in the algorithm .",
    "hence , in her collection of cards some overlaps should not have been considered , and some segments have overlaps with more than one other card . these considerations naturally specify the * domino * and * donkey * problems .    in more realistic situation the attacker does not know the correct list of cards of @xmath95 and hence she needs to choose which @xmath130repeats to ignore .",
    "we may assume that she has some hints as to which overlaps are likely ok .",
    "this is the situation we model by the following problem .",
    "* shortest domino row problem ( sdrp ) . *",
    "assume we are given a collection of dominoes ( domino will mean a rectangle partitioned vertically into two squares , where one is initial and the other one is terminal ) , and we are also given a graph on the squares .",
    "this graph should be interpreted as the graph of hints .",
    "we want to put all the dominoes into a row , so that if two consecutive squares are connected by an edge of the graph , we can put one square on top of the other ( i.e. , identify them ) .",
    "the aim is to make the resulting row as short as possible , i.e. to satisfy as many hints as possible .",
    "let us define the ( de bruijn - type ) graph @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the set of all the squares , and @xmath133 is the set of the dominoes : edge @xmath134 connects the squares of domino @xmath92 .",
    "the following observation is straightforward .",
    "[ o.eut ] there is a natural bijection between the set of the euler circuits ( eulerian closed walks ) of @xmath135 and the set of all the circular sequences consistent with the overlapping dominoes @xmath136 .",
    "[ thm.dom ] the sdrp is search - np - complete .",
    "assume that in the auxiliary graph , there is edge between two squares if they are equal , but not all such edges are there .",
    "this is exactly consistent with our interpretation .",
    "now , in the reformulation with the de bruijn graph and the euler circuit , this corresponds to the problem that we are given a graph , with some transitions between neighboring edges recommended , and we want to find an euler circuit with as many recommended transitions as possible .",
    "a particular instance is that some transitions are forbidden , and we want to find out whether euler circuit where all the transitions are allowed exists .",
    "this is known to be np complete ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have in fact a _ search instance _ of this problem : we know that such an euler circuit exists , and we want to find it . there is a standard trick which shows that the decision problem is polynomial if the search problem is polynomial :    assume there is a polynomial algorithm @xmath137 that solves the search version , and let its running time be @xmath138 , say . to solve the decision problem , we apply @xmath137 to an input .",
    "it either finds the right euler circuit and then the answer is yes , or it runs longer than @xmath138 , and then the answer is no .    in the * donkey problem *",
    "we assume that _ @xmath18 has no accidental repeats_. what the attacker gets ? there are two versions of the algorithm .",
    "let us first consider the _ strong concealing _ where the preliminary step is performed .    1 .",
    "as described above , using the @xmath130repeats of length @xmath111 of @xmath18 , the attacker gets the cards of @xmath139 , i.e. @xmath103 , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 2 .",
    "the attacker also gets each @xmath142 and each @xmath143 since these are exactly maximal initial and terminal segments of the cards above which are repeated twice in @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   by matching the overlaps",
    ", the attacker gets each pair @xmath144 since the overlap @xmath98 in @xmath143 is a terminal segment of @xmath142 and we may assume that these can not be misinterpreted .",
    "4 .   what the attacker gets from the initial applications of procedure @xmath1 ? each of their overlaps ( of length @xmath111 ) appears at least twice in the input of @xmath74 .",
    "moreover most of the _ cuts _ of the procedures @xmath1 are different .",
    "let us recall here that among these overlaps may be also the dust .",
    "procedures @xmath74 and @xmath95 _ cut _ into some of these .",
    "those cut will remain 2-repeats , those not cut may gain repeats .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 introduces dust in the border of each card : this adds 2-repeats of strings of length @xmath111 undistinguishable from the 2-repeats coming from initial procedures @xmath1 .    in case weak concealing algorithm",
    "is applied , the attacker has @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are replaced by @xmath148 and @xmath149 is replaced by @xmath150 .",
    "the next proposition summarises the possible types of repeats introduced by the algorithm .",
    "[ p.corr ] all the repeats of @xmath18 generated by the weak or strong concealing algorithm are those described in @xmath151 .",
    "[ p.conc ] all the useful information for the attacker problem is @xmath16 , @xmath7 , and @xmath151 .",
    "the information @xmath145 may be described by the auxiliary bipartite graph @xmath50 defined in definition [ def.auxg ] .",
    "if the weak concealing algorithm is applied , information @xmath152 $ ] does not exist .",
    "the attacker problem is thus reduced to the following :    * the donkey - decision problem . *",
    "the input is a bipartite graph @xmath135 where the vertices in both parts @xmath153 are ordered .",
    "let @xmath154 and @xmath53 .",
    "moreover a segment @xmath155 of length at least @xmath156 is associated with each element of @xmath62 .",
    "the set of the edges of @xmath135 is formed by a disjoint union of two perfect matchings @xmath157 .",
    "the attacker needs to reconstruct string @xmath158 where @xmath71 is the vertex of @xmath62 connected with @xmath159 by an edge of @xmath56 .",
    "the difficulty of the donkey - decision problem is the following : bipartite graph @xmath135 is a union of two edge - disjoint perfect matchings .",
    "each vertex of @xmath135 thus has degree @xmath14 and @xmath135 is a union of disjoint cycles . to solve the donkey - decision problem",
    ", one needs to _ choose the correct perfect matching _ independently in each of these cycles ( namely , the perfect matching induced by @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is impossible , and the list of all the possibilities is almost always exponential in the number of the cycles , since each of the cycles has two perfect matchings .",
    "this is analysed precisely below , when we speak about the _",
    "feasible solutions_.    next we argue that , when the strong concealing algorithm is applied , the attacker problem is reduced to the donkey - decision problem too .",
    "the attacker is left with the statistics of the repeats of @xmath18 .",
    "here comes the reason why we introduced the dust in @xmath74 : it is to make sure that the 2-repeats appear symmetric for both matchings @xmath160 .",
    "this hides the repeats introduced by the initial applications of procedure @xmath1 .",
    "the information of @xmath152 $ ] is thus useless .",
    "we obtain :    [ prop.att ] the attacker problem for both strong and weak concealing is reduced to the analysis of the donkey - decision problem .    a _ feasible solution _ to the donkey - decision problem",
    "is any sequence @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is any perfect matching of the input bipartite graph @xmath135 . in order to solve the donkey - decision problem",
    ", one needs to choose , from the pool of these feasible solutions , the unique correct one .",
    "next we argue that unless the input to our problem is extremely restrictive , there is an exponential number of the competative solutions .",
    "the bipartite graphs @xmath135 coming from @xmath64 have at least @xmath163 perfect matchings .",
    "the output sequences of two perfect matchings @xmath164 may still be equal : if the cycle has length @xmath127 , this happens if and only if the two vertices @xmath165 of @xmath62 in each @xmath130cycle in which @xmath164 differ have the same associated segment ( @xmath166 as defined in observation [ o.grat ] ) .    for instance ,",
    "if all the vertices of @xmath62 have the same associated segment , then there is only one competative solution .",
    "this extreme situation may happen if the input @xmath17 is a sequence of repetitions of one symbol only .",
    "if two symbols may appear in the segments ( of length at least @xmath156 ) associated with the vertices of @xmath62 , then the probability that in @xmath167 @xmath127-cycles the corresponding pairs of strings are indistinguishable is @xmath168 .",
    "hence with only exponentially small probability there is less than an exponential number of feasible solutions .",
    "we define the information concealing problem and propose an algorithm to solve it .",
    "it is based on the intuition coming from the difficulties of dna reconstruction by hybridisation .",
    "the algorithm may be efficiently implemented . in analysing the amount of information leaked by the concealing algorithm to an attacker",
    "( this is called the _ attacker problem _ in the paper ) , we first consider the case that the output contains random repeats ; this leads to the _ domino problem _ which is shown to be np - complete . even if the attacker solves the domino problem , she is faced with the _ donkey problem _ which is reduced to the _ donkey - decision problem_. it is shown that with high probability the donkey - decision problem has an exponential number of feasible solutions among which the attacker needs to choose the correct one .",
