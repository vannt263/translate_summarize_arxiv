    "we say that @xmath8 is _ bicuspidal _ if and only if it has both its ends in the cusp ( in that case there is a point @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is @xmath8 with reverse orientation ) ; otherwise @xmath8 is called _",

    "mcshane proved the following theorem ( ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4 ) ) : _ _ _ _ _ _ _    [ thm : mcshane ]    let @xmath0 be a complete hyperbolic surface with finite area and a cusp @xmath1 .",
    "with notation as above , @xmath13 consists of a cantor set ( say @xmath14 ) and isolated points , so that the following holds :    1 .",
    "@xmath15 is isolated if and only if @xmath8 is bicuspidal ; 2 .",

    "@xmath14 has a countably infinite set of endpoints and uncountable set of points that are not endpoints . ]",
    "moreover , every connected component of @xmath17 contains exactly one isolated point of @xmath13 .",
    "thus a component of @xmath17 ( say @xmath18 ) is bound by two points ( say @xmath12 and @xmath19 ) so that @xmath7 and @xmath20 spiral onto simple closed geodesics , say @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to see that these geodesics co - bound a pair of pants with the cusp . by using basic hyperbolic trigonometry (",
    "* proposition 3 ) mcshane showed that the length of @xmath18 is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the hyperbolic length restricted to @xmath5 .",

    "their work resulted in many alternate proofs and generalizations of theorem  [ thm;mcshane s identity ] .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give a short elementary proof of theorem  [ thm : mcshane ] .",
    "the proof is set in the universal cover of @xmath0 ( denoted @xmath26 and identified with the upper half plane in @xmath27 ) and uses basic geometry of the hyperbolic plane and the action of @xmath28 on @xmath26 ; we view @xmath28 as a subgroup of the isometries of @xmath26 .",
    "our proof is based on a new interpretation of the open intervals complementary to @xmath14 ; mcshane refers to these intervals as _ gaps _ _ ; below we call them _ deadzones__. we remark that a geodesic on @xmath0 is simple if and only if any two of its lifts to @xmath26 are disjoint .",
    "we call a geodesic in @xmath26 _ simple _ if it is disjoint from all it images under @xmath28 ; thus the statements  @xmath29 is simple \" and  some lift of @xmath30 to @xmath31 is simple \" and  all lifts of @xmath30 to @xmath26 are simple \" are equivalent . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    * remark . *",
    "it is well known that mcshane s theorem holds for surfaces with more than one cusp and with totally geodesic boundary components ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "though we assume some familiarity with the basic notions of hyperbolic geometry , we pause to sketch out some essential terminology , notations and ideas ; the reader familiar with planar hyperbolic geometry may skip this section as the results in the section are well - known",
    ". the hyperbolic plane may be compactified by adding a circle at infinity that we denote @xmath32 ( defined by equivalence classes of geodesics that approach each other asymptotically ) .",
    "we work in the upper half plane model which we identify with @xmath33 .",
    "then we get that @xmath34",
    ". geodesics in @xmath26 are in one - to - one correspondence with pairs of distinct points in @xmath32 and oriented geodesics are in one - to - one correspondence with ordered distinct pairs of points .    in the upper - half plane model , we arrange @xmath26 so that @xmath35 is a lift of the cusp and its cuspidal subgroup is generated by @xmath36 .",
    "then every cuspidal oriented geodesic has a vertical lift ( clearly not unique ) oriented downwards and ending at some @xmath37 . throughout this paper",
    "we denote this lift by @xmath38 ( not to be confused with @xmath7 of section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "it should be clear that when we refer to a neighborhood of a cuspidal geodesic @xmath8 we mean the set of geodesics @xmath10 with @xmath19 in a neighborhood of @xmath12 . by an _ interval _ about @xmath38 we mean the set of geodesics @xmath39 , for some @xmath40 .",
    "_    let @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 then an _ open horodisk _ centered at @xmath43 is a set of the form @xmath44 ( for some fixed @xmath45 ) . for @xmath46 an open horodisk centered at @xmath43 is a euclidean open disk of euclidean radius @xmath47 centered at @xmath48 ( for some @xmath49 ) .",
    "a closed horodisk is obtained by taking the closure in @xmath31 of an open horodisk .",
    "thus a closed horodisk is a closed upper half plane or a closed disk with a point removed from its boundary . _ _    the fundamental group @xmath28 can be viewed naturally as a discrete , fixed - point free subgroup of the orientation preserving isometries of @xmath31 .",
    "the following classification is well known :    [ lem : classification of geodesics ]    let @xmath50 be an orientation preserving isometry , other than the identity . then exactly one of the following holds :    1 .",
    "( elliptic ) @xmath51 has a fixed point in the interior of @xmath31 .",
    "such @xmath51 can not be an element of @xmath28 .",
    "( parabolic ) @xmath51 has exactly one fixed point and this fixed point is on @xmath32 .",
    "locally the fixed point is an attractor on one side and repeller on the other . if @xmath52 then the fixed point is said to be a lift of the cusp and a sufficiently small horodisk centered at the fixed point is an infinite cyclic cover of a neighborhood of the cusp .",
    "( hyperbolic ) @xmath51 has exactly two fixed points and these fixed points are on @xmath32 .",
    "one fixed point is an attractor and the other repeller .",
    "the geodesic connecting the fixed points is called the _ axis _ of @xmath51 ( denoted in this paper @xmath53 ) and @xmath51 acts on @xmath53 by translation . _",
    "_    axes of hyperbolic isometries correspond to closed geodesics on @xmath0 : a hyperbolic isometry @xmath52 generates a cyclic group that acts on the axis @xmath53 and the quotient is a ( not necessarily simple ) closed geodesic on @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , every closed geodesic on @xmath0 has a lift to @xmath54 that is an ( open ) geodesic , say @xmath53 . then @xmath55 ( here , the fundamental group of the circle ) acts on @xmath53 to give the closed geodesic .",
    "any non - trivial element of this cyclic group is a hyperbolic isometry whose axis is @xmath53 .",
    "no point on @xmath32 is a fixed point of both a hyperbolic and a parabolic transformation in @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a fixed point of a parabolic isometry .",
    "as remarked above a small horodisk about @xmath43 is an infinite cyclic cover of a neighborhood of the cusp .",
    "therefore any geodesic that has @xmath43 as one of its endpoints projects to a non - compact geodesic on @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    "let @xmath56 be a fixed point of a hyperbolic isometry @xmath51 ; then @xmath56 is the endpoint of the axis of @xmath51 which projects to a closed curve on @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 has finite area , fundamental domains in @xmath31 must become arbitrarily small ( in the euclidean metric ) as they approach @xmath57 ; we therefore have :    [ lem : lifts of c are dense ] the lifts of the cusp are dense in @xmath32 .",
    "note too that since the set of lifts of the cusp is countable , the complement of this set is also dense .    like every study of simple geodesics",
    ", we need :    [ lem : simplicity closed ] simplicity is a closed condition .",
    "let @xmath58 be a non - simple geodesic .",
    "then @xmath58 intersects one of its images , say @xmath59 .",
    "a small perturbation of @xmath58 gives a small perturbation of @xmath59 and so the two geodesics still intersect .",
    "therefore non - simplicity is an open condition and simplicity is a closed condition .",
    "we end this section with a well - known lemma that relates geodesics to topological properties of curves .",
    "a curve on @xmath31 is called proper if its ends are at infinity .",
    "two proper curves are said to be _ properly homotopic _ if there is a homotopy taking one to the other such that the ends remain at infinity at all times .",
    "all homotopies considered in this paper are proper .",
    "_ _    [ lem : geodesic homotpis to simple is simple ]    let @xmath60 be a simple curve that is properly homotopic to a geodesic @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath61 is simple as well .",
    "if @xmath61 is not simple then there exists a @xmath62 so that @xmath63 ; equivalently , the endpoints of @xmath61 separate the endpoints of @xmath64 .",
    "since the homotopy is proper , endpoints do not move .",
    "thus @xmath60 must intersect @xmath65 and @xmath60 is not simple .",
    "we pause for the proof of mcshane s theorem , postponing several required technical lemmas .    in section  [ sec : deadzone ]",
    "we show that every simple bicuspidal geodesic @xmath30 lies in an open interval of otherwise non - simple geodesics ( [ thm : deadzone ] ) ; this interval is called the _ deadzone _ of @xmath30 and @xmath30",
    "is called the _ center _ of the deadzone .",
    "next we show that the endpoints of each deadzone are simple ( [ pro : deadzone and simplicity ] ) and unicuspidal ( [ prop : ends of deadzone are unicuspidal ] ) .",
    "consequently , the deadzones are disjoint .",
    "_ _ _ _    in section  [ sec : non simple in dz ] we show that every non - simple geodesic lies in a deadzone ( [ prop : non - simple in deadzone ] ) .",
    "in particular we have that any bicuspidal geodesic lies in a deadzone ( a non simple geodesic lies in a deadzone by  [ prop : non - simple in deadzone ] and a simple geodesic is the center of a deadzone ) ; hence since the lifts of the cusp are dense ( [ lem : lifts of c are dense ] ) , so too is the union of the deadzones . letting @xmath66 parameterize the set of simple unicuspidal geodesics we have that @xmath14 is exactly the complement of the union of the deadzones",
    "this has two immediate consequences : first every interval of @xmath17 contains exactly one point of @xmath13 and these points correspond to the bicuspidal geodesics ( the centers of the deadzones ) .",
    "second , @xmath14 is totally disconnected and closed . in order to show @xmath14",
    "is a cantor set we need only show @xmath14 is perfect  that every point @xmath67 is a limit point of @xmath68 .    in section  [ sec : convergence onto rational ]",
    "we show that the endpoints of @xmath14 are limit points ( [ prop : endpoints of deadzones are limit points ] ) .",
    "it follows that the remaining points of @xmath14 are limit points as well : choose @xmath69 that is not an endpoint ; since the lifts of the cusp are dense ( [ lem : lifts of c are dense ] ) in any open interval @xmath70 containing @xmath12 there exist a lift of the cusp , say @xmath19 . since @xmath71 is bicuspidal",
    "it is contained in a deadzone , say @xmath72 . by definition @xmath73 ( in particular @xmath12 is not@xmath74 ) , and by assumption @xmath12 is not an endpoint ; therefore an endpoint of @xmath72 must also lie in @xmath70 ( in fact between @xmath12 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus @xmath12 is a limit point of @xmath14 and we see that @xmath14 is perfect as required .    in section  [ sec : classification ] we show that the simple cuspidal geodesics on @xmath0 that spiral into simple closed geodesics are exactly the projections of endpoints of deadzones ( [ prop : denpoint project to spiraling geodesics ] ) ; with this we complete the proof of mcshane s theorem .",
    "we now show that any simple bicuspidal geodesic @xmath75 has a neighborhood that contains no simple geodesic except @xmath75 itself . before stating the theorem we describe the geometry of a simple bicuspidal oriented geodesic @xmath75 .",

    "a horodisk centered at @xmath12 is an infinite cyclic cover of the cusp . in it",
