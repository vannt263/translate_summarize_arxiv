    "cool white dwarfs are among the oldest objects in the universe .",
    "the detection of large populations of these old stars in our galaxy gives us a unique opportunity to use them as chronometers . to achieve this goal",
    ", we need reliable atmosphere models for cool white dwarfs .",
    "such models would allow for a better determination of the atmospheric parameters of observed white dwarf stars , tracking the evolution of their atmospheric composition , and to obtain better boundary conditions for modeling internal structures and the cooling of these stars @xcite .",
    "one problem in modeling cool white dwarf atmospheres is the implementation of the dppen - anderson - mihalas ( hereafter dam ) model @xcite in calculating the pseudo - continuum bound - free opacity from the ground state of atomic hydrogen .",
    "when this source of opacity is calculated following the dam prescription with the occupation probabilities of hummer & mihalas ( 1988 , hereafter hm ) for white dwarfs with @xmath1 , it dominates all other absorption processes at optical wavelengths .",
    "such strong absorption is completely unrealistic and is not observed @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this process may still be significant in white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggested that this absorption mechanism may be responsible for the observed flux suppression in the blue part of the spectra of cool white dwarfs .",
    "following that idea , @xcite introduced an arbitrary damping function to the dam pseudo - continuum opacity to obtain good fits of the models to the photometry of selected stars .",
    "however , the damping function must be adjusted for each star , indicating how unsuitable the dam model is . as a result",
    ", the pseudo - continuum bound - free opacity of hydrogen atoms is ignored in the modeling of cool white dwarf atmospheres . in this paper",
    "we readdress this issue by computing this absorption mechanism with a much more realistic physical model to assess its importance in cool white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the pseudo - continuum bound - free opacity results from the perturbation of hydrogen atoms in their ground state by their interaction with other particles in a dense medium @xcite .",
    "such perturbations result in a lowering of the ionization barrier of some of the hydrogen atoms and the possibility of a bound - free transition caused by photon with energies that are smaller than the ionization potential of the isolated hydrogen atom .",
    "dam consider this process in the framework of the occupation probability formalism proposed by hm .",
    "they constructed a simple model for the optical properties of an interacting hydrogen medium . in the weakly ionized atmospheres of cool white dwarfs ,",
    "the hydrogen atoms in higher excited states are perturbed mostly by neutral particles @xcite and eventually destroyed ( pressure ionized ) by excluded volume interactions .",
    "the effect is stronger for excited states because the size of a hydrogen atom is a monotonically increasing function of the principal quantum number .",
    "this model for the pseudo - continuum opacity is not very precise , as it treats the inter - particle interactions and the associated lowering of the ionization potential only in terms of the average sizes of the particles .",
    "we will show that a quantum mechanical description of the interactions between hydrogen atoms and perturbers , absent in the simple dam model , is necessary to obtain a physically realistic value of the pseudo - continuum opacity of hydrogen atoms in the atmospheres of white dwarf stars .    to accurately account for the effect of lowering the hydrogen ionization barrier in a dense medium , we consider short - range , binary collisions .",
    "the ionization energy of the perturbed hydrogen atom is given by the ionization energy of the h - perturber pair .",
    "this energy is given by the difference between the exact interaction energy curves calculated quantum mechanically of the neutral and singly ionized dimers ( interacting pairs ) .",
    "the probability of having a pair colliding with a given collision distance can be determined from the interaction potential of the neutral dimer .",
    "the resulting probabilities of lowered hydrogen ionization potential for the physical conditions of white dwarfs atmospheres are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained from the dam model with the hm occupation probabilities . in the next section",
    "we discuss the dam approach to the pseudo - continuum opacity .",
    "our new calculations of this absorption mechanism and its application to the physical conditions found in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs are presented in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the dam model is based on the occupation probability formalism introduced by hm for calculating thermodynamical properties of a non - ideal gas .",
    "hm introduced the non - ideal effects on the equation of state by modifying the internal partition functions of bound species .",
    "the modified partition function of the hydrogen atom is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 indicates the atomic level , @xmath5 is the statistical weight , @xmath6 is the energy of hydrogen atom counted from the energy of the ground state ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the temperature , and @xmath9 is the occupation probability . in the hm model , @xmath10 represents the strength of non - ideal gas perturbations on an atomic level _",
    "its value for the physical conditions found inside weakly ionized cool white dwarf atmospheres is given by the excluded volume interactions model @xcite and decreases for higher principal quantum number ( hm , equation 3.4 ) . the number of hydrogen atoms in the excited state @xmath4 is expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number density of atomic hydrogen .",
    "_    dam extended this model for the calculation of the optical properties of hydrogen atoms in the partially ionized plasma .",
    "they interpreted the factor @xmath13 as the fraction of hydrogen atoms with atomic level @xmath4 being  dissolved , \" i.e. sufficiently perturbed to describe an unbound electron and ion .",
    "they assigned this value to the fraction of free - electrons states available for a bound - free transition to level @xmath4 .",
    "dam used this interpretation to derive that for the absorption of a photon associated with the transition from level @xmath4 to level @xmath14 , the probability that level @xmath14 is bound , and the transition is  bound - bound , \" is @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the probability of having a  bound - free \" transition is @xmath16 to describe the pseudo - continuum absorption to the continuum energy levels localized between two discrete but  dissolved \" levels of the hydrogen atom , dam introduced the pseudo - level @xmath17 with occupation probability @xmath18 .",
    "the latter is calculated by the interpolation between the @xmath10 s .",
    "therefore , the probability that , during the @xmath4 to @xmath17 transition , the absorbing electron goes into the continuum is given by ( eq .",
    "32 of dam ) @xmath19    the dominant perturbers in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs are neutral particles . therefore in calculating the dam pseudo - continuum opacity we used the hard sphere model for @xmath9 of hm ( section iiia ) . in figure 1",
    "we present the main opacity sources at the photosphere of white dwarf star lp 380 - 5 considered for the potential presence of pseudo - continuum opacity by @xcite .",
    "the dam pseudo - continuum opacity is much too high and dominates all other opacity sources by orders of magnitude .",
    "this is unrealistic and simply not observed .",
    "therefore , the dam model highly overestimates the probabilities of pseudo - continuum bound - free absorption ( eq . [ 9a ] ) in the atmospheres of cool white dwarf stars . in view of the difficulty with this application of the dam model of the pseudo - continuum opacity",
    ", we propose a more realistic approach to calculate this source of absorption .",
    "the bound - free absorption process results in the ionization of a hydrogen atom .",
    "the lowering of the hydrogen ionization potential arises from the interaction of the hydrogen atom with neighboring particles @xcite .",
    "however , we are interested in the pseudo - continuum opacity far from the lyman edge , i.e. @xmath20 . a significant lowering of the hydrogen ionization barrier , by more than @xmath21 , is required for bound - free absorption at these wavelengths .",
    "such a situation occurs in the case of rare , close collisions for which the inter - particle collision distances , @xmath22 , are small enough that the probability ( @xmath23 ) of finding a colliding pair with an inter - particle separation smaller than @xmath22 is much smaller than unity . in this case , multi - particle collisions are insignificant , as the probability of having a close @xmath24-particle collision is roughly @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider the interaction between a @xmath26 atom and its closest neighbor only .",
    "@xcite used this approximation to successfully explain the complex shape of the lyman @xmath27 line wings detected in the spectra of white dwarfs with @xmath28 .    for a given colliding pair",
    "the change in the ionization energy results from the formation of a temporary dimer , whose ionization energy differs from that of the isolated hydrogen atom , @xmath29 .",
    "this modified ionization barrier @xmath30 is given by the ionization energy of a dimer calculated at a fixed inter - particle separation @xmath22 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the energies of the neutral and singly ionized dimers , respectively .",
    "this picture is in the spirit of the franck - condon principle , which states that as a result of large differences between the mass of the absorbing electron and the nuclear mass , the nuclei remain fixed during the absorption / emission of a photon @xcite .",
    "the differential probability of finding such a dimer with an inter - particle separation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the low density medium ( @xmath36 ) is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath37    where @xmath38 is a number density of perturbers , @xmath39 is the interaction energy between a hydrogen atom and the perturber localized at the position @xmath40 in relation to the hydrogen atom , which is assumed to be at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the dominant species , and therefore the main perturbers , in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs are @xmath26 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the sources for the potentials for the interaction of hydrogen atom with perturbers are chosen to be : @xmath43 [ @xcite ] , @xmath44 [ @xcite ] , and @xmath45 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the corresponding potential curves for the singly ionized dimers are chosen to be : @xmath46 [ @xcite ] , @xmath47 [ @xcite ] , and @xmath48 [ @xcite ] .",
    "these potentials are plotted on fig .",
    "2 . as a result of the _",
    "gerade / ungerade symmetry in the @xmath43 interaction , we have to consider both the _ bound and the _ anti - bound @xmath43 potential energy curves . for the singly ionized dimers we choose the ground state potential energy curves because the upper energy curves ( like _ anti - bound state for @xmath49 , fig .",
    "2 . ) would result in a much smaller decrease in the ionization energy for a given @xmath34 .",
    "this decrease occurs with much smaller probability than the same change in the ionization potential that results from the ionic ground states at a much larger @xmath22 , and therefore can be neglected .",
    "the resulting ionization energy @xmath50 for a given dimer as a function of the collision distance are plotted on fig .",
    "3 . the ionization energy can decrease to @xmath51 , which occurs at very small @xmath22 . due to the strong repulsion in the neutral dimer at short separation ( fig .",
    "2 ) , such a large lowering of the ionization energy occurs with very small probability , as for small @xmath34 the boltzmann factor @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the case of the @xmath43 interaction , only the _ anti - bound potential leads to a significant decrease of the ionization barrier ( fig .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    the probability of a hydrogen atom having an ionization energy @xmath30 sufficiently smaller for photo - ionization to be caused by a photon of frequency @xmath53 is @xmath54 where the integration is performed over the range of separations @xmath34 such that @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting probabilities , as a function of photon wavelength @xmath56 , of having a bound - free transition for @xmath26 for two temperatures and three different compositions are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the corresponding probabilities from the dam model ( also shown in fig .",
    "4 ) are a few orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we find that for a given density , collisions with @xmath41 are most effective at lowering the ionization energy of @xmath26 .",
    "this is because for a given value of @xmath50 , the interaction potential @xmath57 computed for the orientation angle @xmath58 ( see caption of fig 2 . for definition )",
    "is much less repulsive than @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the pseudo - continuum opacity is then obtained with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the bound - free cross - section of the isolated hydrogen atom extrapolated beyond the lyman edge ( dam ) , @xmath63 is the number density of hydrogen atoms , and @xmath64 is the mass density",
    ". a proper calculation would consider the bound - free cross - section of the dimer as a function of inter - particle separation . to our knowledge",
    "this information is not available .",
    "however , as the photo - ionization cross - sections for @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath41 @xcite differ by less than a factor of @xmath65 and the cross - section is the effective size of the absorbing system as seen by the photon , we estimate that the extrapolation of the bound - free cross - section of the isolated hydrogen atom beyond lyman edge introduces an uncertainty no larger than an order of magnitude on @xmath66 calculated by eq .",
    "[ 333 ] . in helium - rich atmospheres , where the density can be as high as @xmath67 , equation ( [ 11 ] ) should be corrected when @xmath68 , by a factor @xmath69 @xcite , where @xmath70 is a thermal potential that arises from the correlations in the dense fluid . solving the ornstein - zernike equation in the percus - yevick approximation @xcite for fluid @xmath42",
    ", we have verified that in the helium - rich atmospheres of cool white dwarfs , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , due to correlations in the most extreme case , eq .",
    "[ 333 ] leads to an underestimate of @xmath72 of no more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "we will see below that this does not affect our conclusions .",
    "our goal is to investigate the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite that the pseudo - continuum bound - free absorption by atomic hydrogen beyond the lyman edge may be the missing source of opacity in the atmosphere models of cool white dwarfs @xmath73 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have computed opacities for temperatures , densities and @xmath74 composition that are representative of the photospheres of these stars .",
    "the pseudo - continuum opacity calculated with our model dominates all other sources of opacity at wavelengths shorter than @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "5 ) . for these cool stars",
    "the flux at these wavelengths is extremely small and completely negligible ( see fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that the uncertainty in the photo - ionization cross - section and our neglect of the correlations in dense helium - rich atmospheres do not alter the pseudo - continuum opacity enough to make it important at @xmath76 .",
    "1 . reproduces the opacity plot of @xcite ( fig . 4 in that paper ) .",
    "this figure represents the main sources of opacity for the physical conditions found at the photosphere of the white dwarf star lp 380 - 5 .",
    "our pseudo - continuum opacity is several orders of magnitude smaller than that necessary to fit the blue spectrum ( @xmath77 ) of this star @xcite , and is completely insignificant at @xmath78 .",
    "the possible presence of an unknown absorption mechanism in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs has been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this opacity source has been attributed to the pseudo - continuum bound - free opacity from hydrogen atoms in their ground state that results from a lowering of the ionization potential because of inter - particle interactions in the gas .",
    "opacity models based on the occupation probability formalism highly overestimate this source of absorption in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs .",
    "for this reason , it is usually omitted in models . in this paper",
    ", we presented a realistic model for this absorption mechanism based on binary collisions , exact pair interaction potentials , and the ionization energy of the colliding pair .",
    "we find that the pseudo - continuum bound - free opacity decreases very rapidly with wavelength beyond the lyman edge and becomes completely negligible beyond @xmath79 over the entire range of temperature , density and @xmath80 composition relevant to cool white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "therefore , another absorption mechanism must be invoked to explain the flux excess of the models in the blue part of the spectrum of these stars .",
