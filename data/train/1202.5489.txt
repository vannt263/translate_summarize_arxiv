    "for the clic conceptual design report ( cdr )  @xcite , several physics processes were selected to benchmark the performance of general purpose detectors at a centre - of - mass energy of 3  tev .",
    "the study presented in this document assumes a susy model defined by the msugra parameters @xmath1  gev , @xmath2 , @xmath3  gev , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this model , the lightest chargino , @xmath6 ,",
    "has a mass of @xmath7  gev , while the masses of the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralinos , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are given by @xmath10  gev and @xmath11  gev , respectively .",
    "the lightest neutral higgs boson , @xmath12 , has a mass of @xmath13  gev .",
    "the pair production of charginos and neutralinos was investigated : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "hadronic decays of the @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath20 bosons were considered and hence the investigated final state is given by four quarks and missing transverse energy .",
    "the reconstruction of chargino and neutralino pair production allows to benchmark the reconstruction of hadronically decaying gauge bosons in multi - hadron final states .",
    "more details on the study discussed in the following are given in  @xcite .",
    "the physics events used for the study presented here were generated using the whizard 1.95  @xcite program .",
    "initial and final state radiation ( isr and fsr ) were enabled during the event generation .",
    "the luminosity spectrum expected at clic was used during the event generation .",
    "the hadronisation of final state partons was simulated using pythia  @xcite .",
    "the generated events were accordingly passed through the detector simulation program slic which is based on the geant4  @xcite package . the clic_sid_cdr  @xcite detector geometry model was used .",
    "events were overlayed with pileup from @xmath21 interactions corresponding to 60 bunch crossings  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction chain included an improved version of the pandorapfa  @xcite algorithm to reconstruct particle flow objects .",
    ".cross sections and integrated luminosities of the available monte carlo samples for chargino and neutralino pair production and for susy and standard model backgrounds .",
    "the charge conjugated modes are implied throughout this document.[tab : mcprodstats ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the signals from @xmath22 and @xmath23 pair production were extracted from fully hadronic final states with four jets and missing transverse energy . the study was performed using full simulation and considering pileup from @xmath21 .",
    "two different signal extraction procedures are in reasonable agreement .",
    "the chargino and neutralino pair production cross sections were extracted with a statistical precision of @xmath24 while the masses of the @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 particles were determined with typical statistical accuracies of about @xmath26 .",
