    "in @xcite , tyomkyn and uzzell introduced a new turn - type problem on distances in graphs , which is an extension of the problem studied by bollobs and tyomkyn in @xcite , namely , determining the maximum number of paths with length @xmath4 in a tree @xmath5 on @xmath0 vertices .    the problem on counting paths of a given length in a graph @xmath6 has been studied since 1971 , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . on the other hand , counting paths of length @xmath4 in trees can be interpreted as counting pairs of vertices at distance @xmath4 .",
    "tyomkyn and uzzell asked a natural question as follows .",
    "* question .",
    "* for a graph @xmath6 on @xmath0 vertices , what is the maximum possible number of pairs of vertices at distance @xmath4 ?",
    "let @xmath7 be a connected simple graph .",
    "the distance between two vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath10 , is the length of a shortest path between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the neighborhood of @xmath9 , and @xmath12 denote the degree of vertex @xmath9 .",
    "the greatest distance between any two vertices in @xmath6 is the diameter of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the set of neighbors of a vertex @xmath9 in @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and the set of vertices , whose distance is @xmath16 from @xmath9 , is denoted by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "suppose that @xmath19 is a nonempty subset of @xmath20 .",
    "the subgraph of @xmath6 whose vertex set is @xmath19 and whose edge set is the set of those edges of @xmath6 that have both ends in @xmath19 is called the subgraph of @xmath6 induced by @xmath19 and is denoted by @xmath21 $ ] ; we say that @xmath21 $ ] is an induced subgraph of @xmath6 .",
    "a clique in a graph @xmath6 is a subset of its vertices such that every two vertices in the subset are connected by an edge .",
    "if @xmath22 is a graph , then we say that @xmath6 is @xmath22-free if @xmath6 does not contain a copy of @xmath22 as an induced subgraph .",
    "the claw , denoted by @xmath23 , is the complete graph @xmath24 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is said to be claw - free if it does not contain an induced subgraph that is isomorphic to @xmath23 .",
    "a graph @xmath6 is a _ quasi - line graph _ if for every vertex @xmath2 , the neighborhood of @xmath9 can be partitioned into two sets @xmath25 , @xmath26 in such a way that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both cliques .",
    "( note that there may be edges between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . )",
    "thus all line graphs are quasi - line graphs , and all quasi - line graphs are claw - free , but if we converse either of the statements , it is not true .",
    "for the other notations and terminology we refer to @xcite .    for a graph @xmath6 , a new graph @xmath27",
    "is defined to be the graph with vertex set @xmath28 and @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are at distance @xmath4 in @xmath6 .",

    "there is a function @xmath42 such that if @xmath43 , then @xmath34 is maximised over all @xmath6 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 when @xmath6 is @xmath4-isomorphic to a @xmath35-broom for some @xmath35 .",
