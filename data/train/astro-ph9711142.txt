    "@xmath13 is somewhat smaller .",
    "the flow behavior near @xmath13 has been subjected to numerous studies , especially in the context of black hole accretion disks ( e.g. , muchotrzeb & paczyski 1982 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1984 ; abramowicz et al .  1988",

    "1997 ) : close to @xmath13 the inward radial velocity of the accreting gas increases steeply with decreasing radius and becomes supersonic .",
    "the existence of such marginally stable orbit for neutron star is predicated on the fact that neutron star models constructed using different nuclear equations of state generally give a stellar radius less than @xmath13 ( arnett & bowers 1977 ; kluniak & wagoner 1985 ) .",
    "( ii ) the magnetospheric radius , @xmath14 , below which magnetic stress dominates disk plasma stress . while the precise value of @xmath14 depends on the ( rather uncertain ) details of the magnetic field  disk interactions , it is estimated to close to or slightly less than ( by a factor of a few ) the spherical alfven radius , i.e. , r_mr_ar(b_0 ^ 2r^3m)^2/7 = 18 r_10 ^ 12/7m_1.4 ^ -1/7b_8 ^ 4/7m_17",

    "are comparable , and the plasma may not climb onto the field lines before reaching the stellar surface .",
    "a question therefore arises as to how the magnetic field affects the the dynamics of the inner disk and changes the sonic point . in this paper",
    ", we present an unified ( albeit phenomenological ) treatment of neutron star accretion disks under the combined influences of magnetic fields and strong gravity .",
    "our study is motivated by the recent observations using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) ( bradt , rothschild & swank 1993 ) which revealed kilo - hertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray fluxes of at least thirteen lmxbs ( see van der klis 1997 for a review ) .",
    "these khz qpos are characterized by their high levels of coherence ( with @xmath22 up to @xmath23 ) , large rms amplitudes ( up to @xmath24 ) , and wide span of frequencies ( @xmath25 hz ) which , in most cases , are strongly correlated with the x - ray fluxes . in several sources ,",
    "the x - ray power spectra show twin khz peaks moving up and down in frequency together , with the separation frequency roughly constant .",
    "moreover , in five atoll sources single qpos ( with a much higher level of coherence ) have been seen during one or more x - ray bursts , with frequencies equal to the frequency differences between the two peaks or twice that .",
    "this is a strong indication of beat phenomena ( strohmayer et al .",
    "while the origin of these qpos is uncertain , it is clear that the action must take place close to the neutron star , either in the accreting atmosphere ( klein et al .",
    "1996 ) or in the inner disk ( strohmayer et al .  1996",
    "; miller , lamb and psaltis 1996 ) .",
    "a generic beat - frequency model assumes that the qpo with the higher frequency is associated with the kepler motion at some preferred orbital radius around the neutron star , while the lower - frequency qpo results from the beat between the kepler frequency and the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "it has been suggested that this preferred radius is the magnetosphere radius ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) or the sonic radius of the disk accretion flow ( miller et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we are not concerned with the actual mechanisms by which khz qpos in the x - ray fluxes of lmxbs may be produced ( see miller et al .",
    "1996 and van der klis 1997 for extensive discussion on various possibilities ) .",
    "rather , our main purpose is to understand what physical effects determine the characteristics of the inner accretion disks in lmxbs . in the sonic - point model ,",
    "miller et al .  ( 1996 ) suggest that some accreting gas can penetrate inside the magnetosphere , whose boundary is located at a larger radius than the sonic radius . for unknown reasons",
    ", they assume that these gases are unaffected by the magnetic field once they are inside the magnetosphere and remains in a keplerian disk .",
    "they further suggest that the variation of qpo frequency results from the change in radiative forces on the accretion disk .",
    "we note , however , that the effect of radiative forces on the disk fluid ( rather than test particle orbiting the central star ) , is far from clear .",
    "calculating particle trajectories without solving for the global disk structure ( m.  c. miller 1997 , private communication ) is inadequate for determining the magnitude of the radiative forces .",
    "while the radiative forces may be important for high - luminosity z - sources , their effects on the disk dynamics are expected to be be small for low - luminosity systems ( @xmath26 less than @xmath27 of @xmath28 ) . on the other hand , it is well known that millisecond pulsars have magnetic fields in the range of @xmath29 g , and one expect that neutron stars in lmxbs to have the similar range of field strengths .",
    "while the magnetic field may not be strong enough to induce a corotating magnetosphere outside the neutron star , it can nevertheless influence the dynamics of the inner disk flow by transporting away angular momentum from the disk .",
    "ideally , to properly assess the dynamical effect of magnetic fields on the accretion disks , one needs to solve for both the fluids and the fields self - consistently .",
    "this is a difficult task if not impossible . despite many decades of theoretical studies ( e.g. , pringle & rees 1972 ; lamb et al .",

    "1987 ,  1995 ; stone & norman 1994 ; miller & stone 1997 ) , there remain considerable uncertainties on the nature of the stellar magnetic field ",
    "disk interactions . particularly outstanding are the issues related to the efficiency of magnetic field dissipation in and outside the disk and whether the stellar field threads the disk in a closed configuration or it becomes open due to differential shearing between the star and the disk .",
    "it seems unlikely that some of these issues can be resolved on purely theoretical grounds . in this paper",
    ", we shall not attempt a self - consistent magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) calculations .",
    "rather , _ we shall adopt a phenomenological approach _ and consider rather general field configurations .",
    "we believe that such an approach is useful in bridging the gap between full mhd theories and observations .",
    "indeed , as we show in this paper , if the observed khz qpos are associated with the sonic point kepler frequency , then various systematics of khz qpos should provide useful constraints on the nature of magnetic field ",
    "disk interactions as well as on the magnetic field structure in lmxbs .    in  2 we introduce a model of magnetic slim accretion disk .",
    "numerical solutions are presented in  3 .",
    "because of various uncertainties in disk parameters , we shall focus on the simplest models , leaving more complete exploration to future studies . however ,",
    "in  4 we introduce the notion of `` generalized marginally stable orbit '' including both the gr and magnetic effects .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the sonic radius , which shows that the sonic point depends mainly on two parameters characterizing the disk magnetic field ( in addition to the neutron star mass ) .",
    "we show how different modes of magnetic field  disk interactions can lead to different sonic - point orbital frequencies and their scalings with the field strength and mass accretion rate .",
    "section 5 concerns the equilibrium spin periods of neutron stars in our slim magnetic disk model .",
    "some applications to khz qpos in lmxbs are discussed in  6 , where we show that our phenomenological approach can be used to learn about the physics of magnetic field  disk interactions .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we use geometrized units in which the speed of light and newton s gravitation constant are unity .",
    "we now consider geometrically thin axisymmetric accretion disk in steady state , taking into account of the transonic nature of the flow , and the deviation from keplerian motion in the inner region of the disk .",
    "our models generalize the usual `` slim disks '' around black holes ( e.g. , muchotrzeb & paczyski 1982 ; matsumoto et al .  1984 ; abramowicz et al .  1988 ;",

    "gr effects are included in our purely newtonian treatment by using the pseudo - newtonian potential introduced by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) = -mr-2 m .",
    "this potential correctly reproduces the marginally stable orbit ( where @xmath30 is the spin angular momentum ) , we have @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . for a spin frequency of @xmath33 hz ( strohmayer et al .",

    "these corrections are neglected in this paper . ]",
    "located at @xmath36 , and is adequate for this initial exploration , considering the much greater uncertainties in the magnetic field  disk interactions .",
    "the self - gravity of the disk is neglected .",
    "we assume that the accreting material is confined to a thin disk , and we do not formally introduce a magnetosphere in our model . as discussed in  1 ,",
    "when the field strength is sufficiently high ( as in x - ray pulsars , which typically have @xmath21 g ) , there is no question that a corotating magnetosphere exists outside the neutron star surface , located near @xmath37 ( see eq .  [ [ alfven ] ] ; note that , theoretically , the magnetosphere radius is not known to within a factor of two , nor is it clear what the width of the transition zone is ) . in such a high - field regime , we shall find that the sonic point as obtained from our model is approximately equal to the usual alfven radius .",
    "although in our model the flow continues to be confined in the disk plane even inside the magnetosphere , in reality it may well behave differently ( e.g. , the plasma may `` jump '' onto the field lines and get funneled onto the magnetic poles ) .",
    "thus for high magnetic systems , the supersonic portion of our flow ( inside the sonic point ) may not be realistic .",
    "however , for low magnetic systems ( such as lmxbs ) , which is the main focus of this paper , there needs not be a genuine magnetosphere to truncate the disk flow , but the magnetic forces can still shift the sonic point to a radius larger than @xmath38 . in such low - field regimes ,",
    "we expect our global flow solutions to have a wider validity .",

    "we have also neglected the @xmath50-component of the magnetic stress .",

    "we have presented in   2 - 4 an unified treatment of the inner region of accretion flow under the combined influences of general relativistic gravity and stellar magnetic fields in lmxbs .",
    "we have shown that even relatively weak magnetic fields ( @xmath0 g ) can slow down the orbital motion in the inner disk by taking away angular momentum from the disk , thereby changing the position of the sonic point significantly ( cf .",
    "figs .  2 - 3 ) .    while the mechanisms responsible for the khz qpos in lmxbs are still uncertain , it is tempting to associate them with orbital motions at a certain preferred radius .",
    "if this is the case , then the keplerian frequency at inner radius of the disk , or more precisely the sonic radius is certainly a natural choice ( see paczyski 1987 for an earlier suggestion on the importance of the disk sonic point ) .",
    "one can envisage a number of different mechanisms that will lead to qpos at @xmath146 and the beat frequency with the stellar spin ( miller et al .",
    "1996 ; van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "the following discussion is based on the hypothesis that the khz qpo frequency corresponds to @xmath131 or the sonic - point kepler frequency .",
    "we note that although our treatment of the magnetic field effects in  2 - 4 is rather general ( albeit based on a phenomenological prescription ) , other physical effects might be at work ( such as radiation forces for high - luminosity systems ; see  1 ) . as a result ,",
    "some of our conclusions below should be considered tentative .",
    "\\(a ) _ range of qpo frequencies and constraint on the magnetic field strength _ : as emphasized by van der klis ( 1997 ) , similar qpo frequencies ( @xmath25 hz ) have been observed in sources with widely different average luminosities @xmath147 ( from a few times @xmath148 to near @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath149 between a few times @xmath150 g  s@xmath20 to @xmath19 g  s@xmath20 ) , while for an individual source @xmath151 often correlates strongly with the x - ray flux .",
    "this peculiar lack of correlation between the qpo frequency and @xmath147 can be explained in our model , as long as the star s magnetic field strength correlates with its @xmath149 in such a way as to leave @xmath152 in a certain range ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for example , if we use the model with @xmath67 ( dipole field ) and @xmath153 hz , then to produce @xmath154 in the range of @xmath25 hz would require @xmath155 ; on the other hand , if we use the model with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( open field configuration ) , we would require @xmath158 ( we have adopted @xmath159 in these examples ) . indeed , such correlation between the magnetic field strength and the mean mass accretion rate among lmxbs has been suggested independently on the basis of z and atoll source phenomenology ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , although the origin for this correlation is still unclear .",
    "we note , however , that the correlation needs not be very strong , considering the wide range of other controlling parameters such as @xmath68 ( the shape of the magnetic field ) and @xmath160 ( stellar rotation ) ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "while there is a natural upper limit to @xmath131 ( corresponding to @xmath161 ; but see ( c ) below ) , the existence of a ( source - dependent ) lower limit to the observed qpo frequency needs an explanation .",
    "if we rely on inner disk accretion to explain these qpos ( e.g. , van der klis 1997 ) , then one possibility is that for large @xmath117 ( small @xmath131 ) , the accreting gas can be channeled out of the disk plane by the magnetic field  this must happen for sufficiently small @xmath3 ( or sufficiently large @xmath162 , as in the case of accreting x - ray pulsars ) .",
    "the precise location where the plasma leaves the disk depends on the near - zone field structure , and is clearly source - dependent .",
    "the observed qpo frequencies may already be used to probe the magnetic fields in lmxbs and the nature of the magnetic field  disk interactions . as an example , consider the atoll source 4u 0614 + 091 which has extremely small luminosity ( see ford et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) : to obtain @xmath163 hz requires @xmath164 ( this constraint depends somewhat on the field structure and @xmath160 ; see fig .  3 ) .",
    "at @xmath165 , this translates to @xmath166  a stronger magnetic field would push the sonic point ( or the generalized mso ) to a larger radius .",
    "we are left with two possibilities : ( i ) if @xmath167 , we would require @xmath168 , i.e. , the dissipation of toroidal fields near the disk must be very efficient ; ( ii ) if @xmath76 ( as expected for open field configurations ) , then we would require @xmath169 . indeed , if the khz qpo sources represent a fair sample of lmxbs , then we might conclude that the magnetic fields in lmxbs are systematically weaker than those in millisecond pulsars .",
    "this may indicate that the magnetic field of a neutron star is `` buried '' during the lmxb phase ( e.g. , romani 1990 ; urpin & geppert 1995 ; konar & bhattacharya 1997 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) , and later regenerates or re - emerges as accretion stops .",
    "\\(b ) _ scaling of @xmath151 with @xmath3 _ : for most sources , it was found that the khz qpo frequency strongly correlates with the xte count rate ( @xmath170 kev ) , with power - law index greater than unity .",
    "however , the scaling relation between the count rate and @xmath3 is not well established , and it has been suggested the flux of the black - body component is a better indicator of qpo frequency ( ford et al .",
    "as discussed in  3 , @xmath131 depends primarily on the magnetic field structure near the sonic point , particularly on the `` field shape '' index @xmath68 . if the scaling of @xmath151 with @xmath3 can be established observationally , it may be possible to distinguish a closed field configuration from an open one .",
    "for example , if we believe the scaling @xmath171 with @xmath172 , then we may conclude that @xmath173 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ largeb ] ] and the discussion following eq .  [ [ xlabel ] ] ) , which indicates that magnetic fields in lmxbs do not have dipolar shape , but rather have complex topology ( see arons 1993 for discussion on related issues ) .",
    "\\(c ) _ the maximum value of @xmath151 _ : it has been suggested ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) based on the narrow range of the maximal qpo frequencies ( @xmath174 hz ) in at least six sources that these maximum frequencies correspond to the kepler frequency at @xmath36 , which then implies that the neutron star masses are near @xmath175 ( see also kaaret et al .",
    "while we agree that this conclusion seems most natural , we nevertheless add the following cautionary notes : ( i ) the inferred large stellar masses may be problematic : all neutron stars with well - determined masses ( including a few that certainly had accreted mass , although not necessarily in the same accretion mode as in lmxbs ) have masses consistent with being @xmath176 ( e.g. , van kerkwijk et al .",
    "in particular , the @xmath177 ms recycled pulsar b1855 + 09 , which is thought to have gone through a lmxb phase ( phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) , has a mass @xmath178 ( kaspi et al .",
    ". moreover , accretion of @xmath179 might have spun up the neutron stars to near break - up ( see cook et al .",
    "1994 for calculations of spin - up tracks in the nonmagnetic case ) , in contrary to the observed spin rates ( @xmath180 hz ) .",
    "( ii ) if the maximum @xmath151 is indeed @xmath181 , then the correlation between @xmath151 and @xmath3 should weaken as @xmath3 increases , and eventually @xmath151 should approaches a constant independent of @xmath3 ( see fig .  3 ) . this has not been observed .",
    "therefore in our opinion it is premature to identify the maximal @xmath151 with the kepler frequency at @xmath38 .",
    "an alternative is that as @xmath151 approaches @xmath174 hz , the rms qpo amplitude decreases  as the observations have indicated , making it difficult to detect higher qpo frequencies .",
    "\\(d ) _ horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) in z - sources _ : in several z - sources ( e.g. , sco x-1 , gx 5 - 1 and gx 17 + 2 ) , hbos with frequencies @xmath182 hz have been detected _ simultaneously _ with the khz qpos ( see van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "one standard interpretation of hbos is that they are associated with the beat between the kepler frequency at the magnetosphere boundary and the neutron star spin ( alpar & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "since the spin frequencies @xmath160 of these sources ( as determined from the difference in the twin khz qpo frequencies ) lie around @xmath33 hz ( see white & zhang 1997 ) , the putative magnetosphere boundary must be located at a large radius where @xmath183 hz . as we have shown in this paper , such a strong magnetic field must necessarily push the ( generalized ) disk sonic point to a large radius where the kepler frequency drops below the kilo - hertz range .",
    "( recall that for low field systems such as lmxbs , the distinction between the sonic point and the magnetosphere boundary probably does not exist , and the two separate radii are replaced by a single generalized sonic point [ see   3 - 4 ] . )",
    "therefore if the khz qpos are associated with the sonic - point kepler frequency , then the magnetospheric beat frequency model for hbos can not work , and the origin of hbos must lie elsewhere .",
    "alternative models for hbos have been discussed by biehle & blandford ( 1993 ) and stella & vietri ( 1997 ) .",
