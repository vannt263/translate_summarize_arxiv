    ".3 cm    for many years , graphs have interested physicists as well as mathematicians . for instance",
    ", equilibrium statistical physics widely uses model systems defined on lattices , the most popular being certainly the ising model @xcite . on another hand , in solid - state physics , tight - binding models ( see , for instance , @xcite )",
    "involve discretized versions of schrdinger operators on graphs .",
    "for all those models , the thermodynamic properties of the system heavily depend on geometrical characteristics of the lattice such as the connectivity and the dimensionality of the embedding space .",
    "however , in general , they do nt depend explicitly on the lengths of the edges .",
    "random walks on graphs , where a particle hops from one vertex to one of its nearest - neighbours , have also been studied by considering discrete laplacian operators on graphs @xcite .",
    ".1 cm    such laplacian operators can also be useful if they are defined on each link of the graph .",
    "for example , in the context of organic molecules @xcite , they can describe free electrons on networks made of one - dimensional wires .",
    "many other applications can be found in the physical literature .",
    "let us simply cite the study of vibrational properties of fractal structures such as the sierpinski gasket @xcite or the investigation of quantum transport in mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "weakly disordered systems can also be studied in that context @xcite .",
    "it appears that weak localization corrections in the presence of an eventual magnetic field are related to a spectral determinant on the graph .",
    "this last quantity is actually of central importance and interesting by itself @xcite . in particular",
    ", it allows to recover a trace formula that was first derived by roth @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectral determinant , when computed with generalized boundary conditions at the vertices , is useful to enumerate constrained random walks on a general graph @xcite , a problem that has been addressed many times in the mathematical literature @xcite .",
    ".1 cm    brownian motion on graphs is also worthwhile to be investigated from , both , the physical and mathematical viewpoints .",
    "for instance , the probability distribution of the time spent on a link ( the so - called occupation time ) was first studied by p levy @xcite who considered the time spent on an infinite half - line by a one - dimensional brownian motion stopped at some time @xmath4 .",
    "this work allowed levy to discover in 1939 one of his famous arc - sine laws @xcite .",
    "since that time , this result has been generalized to a star - graph @xcite and also to a quite general graph @xcite .",
    "local time distributions have also been obtained in @xcite .",
    ".1 cm    it has been pointed out since a long time that first - passage times and , more generally , occupation times are of special interest in the context of reaction - diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "computations of such quantities in the presence of a constant external field have already been performed for one - dimensional systems with absorbing points ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this was done with the help of a linear fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    ".1 cm    the purpose of the present work is to extend those results on a general graph with some absorbing vertices .",
    "we will consider a brownian particle diffusing with a spatially - dependent diffusion constant and subjected to a drift that is defined in every point of each link .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the notations that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "we discuss the boundary conditions to be used at each vertex in section 3 and , also , in the appendices .",
    "more precisely , we analyse in details specific graphs in the appendices a and b. the obtained results allow to deal with a general graph in appendix c. section 4 is devoted to the computation of the average time spent , before absorption , by a brownian particle on a part of the graph . in this section , we also calculate the laplace transform of the joint law of the occupation times on each link . in the following section , we present additional results , especially concerning conditional and splitting probabilities .",
    "various examples are discussed all along the different sections .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section 6 .",
    ".3 cm    let us consider a general graph @xmath5 made of @xmath6 vertices linked by @xmath7 bonds of finite lengths . on each bond [ @xmath8 , of length @xmath9",

    "( we have , of course , @xmath15 ) .",
    ".1 cm    moreover , we suppose that , among all the vertices , @xmath16 of them are absorbing .",
    "( a particle gets trapped if it reaches such a vertex ) .",
    ".3 cm    we will study the motion on @xmath5 of a brownian particle that starts at @xmath17 from some non - absorbing point @xmath18 .",
    "the particle with a spatially - dependent diffusion constant @xmath0 is subjected to a drift @xmath1 defined on the bonds of @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are differentiable functions of @xmath18 on each link . in particular , on each link [ @xmath8 , the following limits @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , ... ,",
    "are well defined .",
    "such notations will be used extensively throughout the paper .",
    ".3 cm    the continuity properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at each vertex will be discussed in the following section .",
    ".1 cm    we also specify the motion of the particle when it reaches some vertex @xmath22 .",
    "let us call @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the nearest neighbours of @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the particle will come out towards @xmath25 with some arbitrary probability @xmath26 ( @xmath27  see @xcite for a rigourous mathematical definition ) . of course ,",

    "it satisfies on each link [ @xmath8 the backward and forward fokker - planck equations :    & = & d ( x _ ) - l^+ ( x_)p ( y t|x_0 ) [ fp ] + & = & l ( y_)p(y_t|x 0 ) [ fpforw ]    .3 cm    @xmath34 will mean @xmath35 when we use the backward fokker - planck equation and @xmath36 when we use the forward equation . the derivatives @xmath37 will be defined in a similar way .",

    "we will not consider the case when both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are discontinuous at the same vertex because , in our opinion , it is ill - defined .",
