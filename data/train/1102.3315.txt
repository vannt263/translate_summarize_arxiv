    "the term  sitnikov problem \" appeared originally in the context of studies of oscillatory solutions in the restricted three body problem .",
    "these studies were initiated by sitnikov  @xcite ; they stimulated the application of symbolic dynamics in celestial mechanics  @xcite .",
    "we recall that sitnikov considered the case when two primaries have equal masses and rotate around their barycenter @xmath0 , while the infinitesimal third body moves along a straight line normal to the plane defined by the motion of the primaries and passing through @xmath0 ( usually the motions of the third body perpendicularly to the plane of the primaries are called  vertical \" ; below we will follow this tradition ) .",
    "sitnikov concentrated his attention on phenomena taking place when the primaries move in elliptic orbits .",
    "more bibliography on `` elliptic '' sitnikov problem can be found , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "if the primaries move in circular orbits , then the vertical motions are integrable .",
    "the corresponding quadratures were presented at the beginning of the xx century by pavanini  @xcite and macmillan  @xcite - much before the start of sitnikov s studies .",
    "relatively simple formulae for the vertical motions , written in terms of jacobi elliptic functions , can be found in  @xcite .    since the integrability of third body motion is something extraordinary within the restricted three body problem , many specialists investigated the properties of vertical motions in the case of primaries moving on circular orbit .",
    "very often the term ",
    "circular sitnikov problem \" is applied to describe this field of research .",
    "taking into account its popularity , we will use it too . nevertheless ,",
    "some authors prefer terms like  pavanini problem \" or  macmillan problem \" , which are probably more correct from the historical point of view .    depending on the initial values , three types of vertical motions",
    "are possible in the circular sitnikov problem : the hyperbolic escape ( i.e. , the escape of the third body with non - zero velocity at infinity ) , the parabolic escape ( i.e. , the escape of the third body with zero velocity as the limit at infinity ) and , finally , the periodic motion , in which third body goes away up to a distance @xmath1 from the plane defined by primaries and then returns to it .",
    "the first stability analysis of the periodic vertical motions in the circular sitnikov problem was undertaken by perdios and markellos  @xcite , but they drew the wrong conclusion that vertical motions are always unstable ( perdios and markellos only analyzed the vertical motions with the initial conditions such that @xmath2 ; as it was established lately it is not enough to put any hypothesis about the stability properties of the motions with larger values of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the mistake was pointed out in  @xcite , where the alternation of stability and instability of vertical motions were found numerically in the case of continuous monotone variation of their amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "lately the existence of such an alternation was confirmed by the results of computations presented in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "taking into account their numerical results , the authors of  @xcite proposed the hypothesis that the lengths of stability and instability intervals have finite limits as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this hypothesis was formulated on the basis of computations in which @xmath1 did not exceed the value @xmath3 .",
    "our numerical investigations demonstrate that the rapidly decreasing difference of the stability intervals at @xmath4 is a manifestation of a local maximum of their lengths ; if @xmath1 is increased further , then the lengths of the stability and instability intervals tend to zero .",
    "there is one more important property of vertical motions , which can be observed only for @xmath5 : the intervals of  complex saddle \" instability , when all eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix are complex and do not lie on the unit circle . according to our computations",
    "first such an interval begins at @xmath6 , its length is @xmath7 .",
    "it means the erroneous of the statement in  @xcite ( p. 113 ) , that the stability indexes of the vertical motions in circular sitnikov problem are always real ( this statement was based on the results of numerical studies in which the amplitude of the motion @xmath1 was smaller @xmath8 ; as one can see it was not enough for such a general conclusion ) .    to conclude our short review on previous investigations of vertical motions stability in circular sitnikov problem",
    "we would like to mention the generalization of this problem for systems of four and more bodies  @xcite .",
    "numerical results presented in  @xcite demonstrate that in the generalized problem the absence of stability / instability alternation in the family of vertical motions persists .",
    "the aim of our paper is to study the stability property of the periodic vertical motions at large values of the  oscillation amplitude \" @xmath1 , both numerically and analytically .",
    "a special attention will be given to the phenomenon of infinite alternation of stability and instability in this family .",
    "in fact , the infinite alternation of stability and instability in the one - parameter family of periodic solutions is rather typical for hamiltonian systems , although the general investigation was carried out only for 2dof systems  @xcite .",
    "different examples can be found in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an important difference exists between the circular sitnikov problem and other systems in which the alternation of stability and instability was established earlier . in the circular sitnikov problem the discussed family of periodic solutions possesses as a limit unbounded aperiodic motions - parabolic escapes , while in previously considered systems the corresponding families and their aperiodic limits were bounded  @xcite . due to this difference",
    ", the alternation of stability and instability in the circular sitnikov problem can not be studied in the same way as it was done in  @xcite ( one could try to compactify the phase space by means of certain changes of variables , but we were unable to find any reduction to what was investigated already ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 some general properties of the vertical motions are discussed . in sect .",
    "3 we present the linearized motion equations used in our studies of the vertical motions stability .",
    "the results of the numerical investigation of the stability are reported in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 we prepare for the analytical investigation : the approximate expression for the monodromy matrix is derived here . using this expression , some important stability properties of vertical periodic solutions with large amplitudes @xmath1",
    "are established in sect . 6",
    "( in particular , the asymptotic formulae for the intervals of stability and instability are obtained ) . in sect .",
    "7 we discuss briefly the vertical motions in the generalized circular sitnikov problem with four and more bodies .",
    "some concluding remarks can be found in sect .",
    "we consider the restricted , circular , three - body problem with primaries having equal masses , say @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a synodic ( rotating ) reference frame with the origin at the barycenter @xmath0 ; the masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arranged on the axis @xmath13 , while the axis @xmath14 is directed along the rotation axis of the system .",
    "the coordinates of the infinitesimal third body in the synodic reference frame will be used as generalized variables : @xmath15 below we assume that all variables are dimensionless .",
    "the equations of motion of the third body can be written in hamiltonian form with hamiltonian function  @xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the distance between the third body and the corresponding primary , while @xmath19 are the momenta conjugated to @xmath20 .",
    "the phase space @xmath21 possesses a manifold @xmath22 which is invariant with respect to the phase flow .",
    "the phase trajectories lying on @xmath23 correspond to vertical motions with the third body staing always on the axis @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the vertical motions are governed by a reduced 1dof system with hamiltonian @xmath24 the phase portrait of the system with the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is shown in fig .",
    "it is remarkable that the separatrices ( the borders between trajectories representing periodic motions and hyperbolic escapes ) intersect at infinity .",

    "the parabolic escapes obey the approximate law @xmath42 formulae ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are easily obtained if one suitably relates the properties of vertical motions with the properties of rectilinear motions of a particle in a newtonian field .",
    "our efforts are concentrated on the analysis of the vertical motions stability with respect to  horizontal \" perturbations , due to which the third body leaves the axis @xmath14 . under the linear approximation ,",
    "the behavior of the variables @xmath43 in the perturbed motion is described by the linear hamiltonian system of equations with periodic coefficients : @xmath44 here @xmath45 @xmath46 the symbol @xmath47 is used to denote the identity matrix of the @xmath35-th order .",
    "the function @xmath48 depends periodically on time with a period @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the period of the particular vertical motion whose stability is investigated .",
    "as it is known , the restricted circular three - body problem admits several types of symmetry ( for example , they are used for the numerical construction of 3d periodic solutions  @xcite ) .",
    "the consequence of these symmetries is the following property of the variational equations ( 6 ) : if @xmath51 is a solution of ( 6 ) , then these equations admit the solution @xmath52 where @xmath53 it the @xmath54-diagonal matrix , @xmath55 .    according to floquet theory , in order to draw a conclusion about the stability or instability of the solutions of ( 6 ) , one should analyze the spectral properties of the monodromy matrix @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the normal fundamental matrix corresponding to the system ( 6 ) ( i.e. , the matrix solution of ( 6 ) with the initial condition @xmath58 ) .",

    "more accurate results were published in  @xcite : the length of the first 35 intervals of stability and of the first 34 intervals of instability was calculated . in  @xcite",
    "also an attempt was undertaken to establish certain regularity in the variation of these quantities : the existence of non - zero limits for the intervals lengths was proposed .    in fig.2 and fig.3",
    "we present the results of some calculations , when the first 700 intervals of stability and instability are considered .",
    "the graph in fig .",

    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath208 are the asymptotic limits for multiplicators ( of multiplicity @xmath209 ) of the system ( 33 ) : @xmath210    finally , it is not difficult to derive the asymptotic formulae the for multiplicators of the original system ( 32 ) : @xmath211 on the complex plane @xmath212 are placed in the small vicinity of the circles with radii @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "consequently in the circular sitnikov problem with four bodies the periodic vertical motions with large amplitudes are always unstable .",
    "finally we would like to note the another opportunity to introduce the generalized circular sitnikov problem with @xmath77 bodies using the appropriate straight line solution of the problem of @xmath215 bodies  @xcite .",
    "if in such a solution @xmath215 primaries are arranged symmetrically with respect to the barycenter then the infinitesimal @xmath77th body can move periodically along an axis around which the rotation of the primaries takes place ( naturally , the proposed generalization is possible for odd @xmath77 only ) .",
    "likely this family of periodic motions exhibits the alternation of stability and instability .",
    "the combination of numerical and analytical approaches provided us with the opportunity to correct , clarify and extend some previously known results related to the circular sitnikov problem ( mainly about the stability of vertical motions ) .",
    "for the first time under the scope of this problem the possibility of the `` complex saddle '' instability was revealed within the family of vertical motions .    for our theoretical constructions it was essential that the phase trajectories corresponding to the solution under consideration have lengthy parts in the vicinity of the peculiar separatrices of the problem - the parabolic escapes to infinity .",
    "often enough it is possible to introduce a suitable auxiliary mapping in the vicinity of the separatrix in order to study the local properties of the phase flow .",
