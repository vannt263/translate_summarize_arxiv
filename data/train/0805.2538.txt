    "noncommutative ( nc ) quantum field theory ( ncqft ) @xcite receives an increasing attention of the theorist community since the advent of a class of renormalizable theories built around the grosse and wulkenhaar model ( gwm ) @xcite .",
    "this model is a nc @xmath10 scalar field theory on the moyal - weyl euclidean space with a particular modification of the propagator .",
    "the gwm is dual in the sense of langmann - szabo ( ls ) @xcite , i.e. considers in a dual manner positions and momenta .",
    "this requires the inclusion of an harmonic term in the  naive \" nc @xmath11 theory which allows to circumvent the deadlock of uv / ir mixing and to insure the renormalizability at all orders of perturbations @xcite .    as a corollary ,",
    "a series of fascinating facts about the gwm have been highlighted @xcite , @xcite-@xcite using different field theory techniques , and other models have been proved renormalizable using the same ideas @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the study of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow has been investigated in detail @xcite@xcite .",
    "the subsumption of a vanishing @xmath0-function , obtained at one loop in @xcite , has been finally achieved at all orders in @xcite ( with @xmath12 ) with as major consequence that the gwm has no landau ghost ( lg ) or triviality problem .",
    "the lg means that , if the renormalized coupling constant is kept fixed and small , the bare constant increases without apparent bound as the uv cutoff is removed .",
    "equivalently , triviality means that the renormalized coupling constant vanishes if the bare constant is kept bounded and small as the uv cutoff is removed .",
    "these twin diseases affect all quantum field theories except non abelian gauge theories , and it was completely unexpected that they do not occur in the gwm .",
    "moreover , the theory is not asymptotically free either , but asymptotically safe : both bare and renormalized coupling constants remain bounded after removing the uv cutoff . a nice argument in order to understand the absence of the usual ",
    "charge screening \" phenomenon is the following @xcite . at one loop ,",
    "the wave function renormalization ( wfr ) does not vanish in contradistinction with the wfr of the commutative theory .",
    "taking into account this wfr , the @xmath0-function _ hitherto _ positive for @xmath13 , tends to zero as @xmath14 tends to @xmath15 . in a way",
    ", the rg flow grinds to a halt at @xmath12 because the ls - duality at that point renders perfectly indistinguishable positions and momenta .",
    "the above scenario called  death of landau ghost \" has been shown to hold to all orders of perturbations by a combination of ward identities and dyson - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "thus , quantum field theories on nc geometry are , at least in this sense , better behaved than ordinary ones and the gwm is a promising candidate for the constructive program @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 invariant nc models with a @xmath16-valued color index have been considered in @xcite , and the vacuum and symmetry breaking of gw models of this type has been investigated in @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the @xmath0-functions of such models .",
    "it should be emphasized that the limits @xmath17 and @xmath18 could be both of special interest , for they are related , respectively , to polymers with non - local self - avoiding interactions @xcite and to a kind of solvable spherical @xcite gwm .",
    "we focus , hereunder , on the one - loop computations recalling that the behavior of the coupling constant flow is really determined by the sign of the first non vanishing coefficient of the @xmath0-function .",
    "in contrast , with @xmath5 , we find non zero coefficients at one loop order , so without further computations , we can reach conclusions on the uv behavior of these rotation invariant gw models . for the class of @xmath1 models with  parallel interaction \" , we find that such models are asymptotically free in the uv regime for @xmath19 , and hence also susceptible of a full constructive analysis .",
    "the model at @xmath20 is not asymptotically free .",
    "the @xmath2 invariant complex nc @xmath10 theory is also discussed and has similar features according to the value of @xmath16 .",
    "finally let us mention that asymptotically safe models of the gwm type with vanishing @xmath0-function at all orders can be obtained by adding a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to notations and general considerations for the @xmath1 gwm .",
    "the complex case construction and treatment are deferred in section 3 as a direct generalization of the real analysis .",
    "we assume the knowledge of renormalization and effective expansions as developed for instance in @xcite , and of nc field theories in the matrix basis as treated in @xcite .",
    "section 3 gives our main result , its proof and further discussions .",
    "the conclusion of this study is given in section 4 .",
    "let us consider a real vector field @xmath21 theory , with @xmath22 , defined by the gwm action in the nc euclidean spacetime @xmath23",
    "@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the inverse of the anticommutative matrix associated with the moyal @xmath27-product . two coupling constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been introduced for the two natural interactions in the quartic term .",
    "now , we write the theory in the matrix basis and use the simpler normalizations of ref.@xcite , with @xmath12 , we can check in ( [ omegaflow ] ) that indeed the rg flow leads to @xmath30 in the uv regime as in the @xmath5 case . ] .",
    "the bare propagator is given by , for all @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and the vertices take the form ( henceforth , implicit sum from @xmath15 to @xmath16 over repeated color indices is used ) @xmath35 we call @xmath36 the  parallel \" vertex and @xmath37 the  crossed \" vertex . after these manipulations , the action can be written as @xmath38    * renormalizability of the model . * at @xmath30 , the propagator is diagonal in the color index and independent of its value and it is the same as in the ordinary gwm , the model is a pure matrix theory , in the sense that the probability distribution is independent for each matrix coefficient although it is not identically distributed ( often called i.ni.d . ) .",
    "as already remarked , for any fixed @xmath39 , the flow of @xmath14 always goes rapidly to @xmath12 in the uv which is of course the small distance limit of interest @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , a slice decomposition of the propagator identical to the one of @xcite leads to an identical power counting .",
    "one concludes that , as in the @xmath5 case , the only divergent contributions come from graphs with two or four external legs with genus zero and exactly one broken external face .",
    "the techniques of subtraction of logarithmically divergent graphs and of mass and wave function renormalizations used in the gwm can be applied here .",
    "hence , the @xmath1 gwm as defined in ( [ act ] ) is renormalizable .",
    "* goals . *",
    "we want to compute at one loop the dynamics of the effective constant couplings , say @xmath40 where the wave function renormalization is @xmath41 and the self - energy @xmath42 is the sum of the amputated one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) amplitudes of the two point correlation function @xmath43 the amputated 1pi four point functions in ( [ gamma4 ] ) are @xmath44 note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are fixed in equations ( [ topt ] ) and ( [ fopt ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the derivative taken on @xmath47 ( [ zee ] ) is actually a matter of choice since one obtains the same result by deriving by the external indices @xmath48 and putting the remaining to @xmath49 .",
    "the flow of the @xmath14 parameter , at one loop and up to a constant , is given as in @xcite by @xmath50 and induces , for any @xmath39 , the uv fixed point @xmath51 ( see below eq.([sigz ] ) ) .",
    "* feynman rules . * in the scalar gwm , the feynman rules are expressed in terms of ribbon graphs .",
    "only graphs with genus @xmath52 and one broken external face @xmath53 with at most 4 external legs may diverge .",
    "they govern the rg flow of the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath14 and the field strength @xmath56 ( or wfr ) of the model . considering the @xmath1 model",
    ", it is convenient to add to the ribbon graphs an inner  thread \" or  decoration \" which represents the color index .",
    "the corresponding feynman rules read off as    , @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the model.,width=264,height=132 ]    , @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the model.,width=264,height=151 ]    1 .   to each ribbon line",
    "is associated a @xmath59 propagator ; 2 .",
    "each vertex of the first kind @xmath36 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) has a weight equals to @xmath60 ; 3 .",
    "each vertex of the second kind @xmath37 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) has a weight equals to @xmath61 .",
    "4 .   to each ribbon face is associated a sum over the @xmath62 corresponding integers .",
    "these sums together with the @xmath59 propagators command to the usual power counting , which is the same as the one of the scalar model . 5 .",
    "the color sum produces an additional contribution of @xmath16 for each colored  bubble \" . for instance",
    ", only @xmath63 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) will have a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "as was thoroughly argued in @xcite and shall not be refrained here , the effective perturbative expansion is better in order to study the @xmath0-function for it just contains the necessary subtractions .",
    "we therefore use the effective expansions in the next developments .",
    "one notes that the sum involved in ensuing amplitude of graphs are divergent .",
    "it is only after subtraction of the mass divergences and other subtractions that these sums appear now finite even after removing the cutoff .",
    "the following statement holds .",
    "[ theo ] at @xmath12 , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 which is logarithmically divergent when removing the uv cutoff .    the divergence of @xmath66 is logarithmic and corresponds both to the bubble four point function divergence and to the wave function renormalization of the tadpole _",
    "after mass subtraction_. the proof of this theorem involves the coming lemmas .",
    "[ lem1 ] at @xmath12 , for the nc @xmath67 model at the first order in @xmath68 , @xmath69 , the self - energy and the wave function normalization are @xmath70 respectively .",
    "[ lem2 ] at @xmath12 , for the nc @xmath67 model at one loop , the amputated 1pi four point functions are given by , @xmath71    the remaining of this section is devoted to the proof of these lemmas and theorem .",
    "* proof of lemma [ lem1 ] . *",
    "the self - energy is @xmath72 where @xmath73 runs over two point 1pi graphs , @xmath74 is its amplitude and @xmath75 is the corresponding combinatorial weight including color summation , that is the number of wick contractions given rise to @xmath76 times the sum over color indices . at first order , only the tadpole graphs @xmath63 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) contribute to ( [ sigma ] ) with the combinatorial factors @xmath77 respectively .",
    "we introduce @xmath78 and get the amplitudes @xmath79 where the propagators @xmath80 and @xmath81 coincide with the up and down versions of the tadpole , respectively @xcite . equation ( [ eqsig ] ) follows from ( [ com ] ) and ( [ st ] ) .",
    "the wfr @xmath56 is readily obtained by taking the correct derivative onto @xmath42 and setting external indices to zero .",
    "@xmath82    * proof of lemma [ lem2 ] . * in order to determine the two four point functions driving the equations of the rg flows at one loop , we consider the  decorated \" graphs of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that , only the run of colors in the vertices is represented .",
    "given the  skeleton \" ( this stands for the set of cyclic ordering of the external indices @xmath83 connected on the ribbon one loop diagram @xcite in a planar manner without more than one external broken face and a genus zero as it is the case in the scalar gwm ) , the data really sufficient for the underlying combinatorics of the perturbative study is the above color course .",
    "the one loop 1pi amputated four point functions have the form @xmath84 here , @xmath73 are four point 1pi graphs with the required topology of amplitude @xmath85 and of combinatorial weights @xmath75 .",
    "the graphs @xmath86 , @xmath87 , contribute to @xmath88 and @xmath89 to @xmath90 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) and their combinatorial factors ( including again color summation ) are @xmath91 it is worthy to emphasize that each graph @xmath92 , for @xmath93 , has a symmetric partner with the same amplitude , so that their combinatorial factor @xmath94 , @xmath93 , have taken into account such a symmetry factor .",
    "things appear differently for the graph @xmath89 which has four partners by rotating the graph by @xmath95 but the amplitudes generated by these rotations are not all equal .",
    "the combinatorial factor @xmath96 considers only the rotation by @xmath97 .",
    "we get the amplitudes such that @xmath98     and @xmath99 associated with four point functions @xmath88 and @xmath90 , respectively.,width=453,height=188 ]    given ( [ com4 ] ) and ( [ s1])-([s3 ] ) , the following expressions rest on a straightforward algebra @xmath100 the lemma is proved from ( [ gam1 ] ) and ( [ gam2 ] ) , once the external indices @xmath101 are put to @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath82    * proof of theorem [ theo ] . *",
    "the proof of equations ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam2 ] ) come out from the quotients @xmath102 expanding the rational function @xmath103 up to the second order in the coupling constants , we get the coefficients @xmath104 as in ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath105 we are then lead to the one loop @xmath0-coefficients @xmath106 which achieve the proof of the statement . @xmath82 .",
    "* discussion . * for @xmath19 , one notes that @xmath107 .",
    "consequently , in the uv limit and setting @xmath108 , the model is asymptotically free , i.e. the bare coupling @xmath109 is screened in this limit .",
    "the renormalon problem has to be considered but its contribution possesses an alternate sign which in principle could be handled by some summability principle such as borel resummation @xcite . for @xmath4 , and still @xmath108 , the ordinary issue of lg arises .",
    "besides , if we assume that second order terms in equations ( [ run1 ] ) and ( [ run2 ] ) vanish , a way to force the system to be such that @xmath110 , the algebraic system reached can be inverted with nontrivial ( not free theory ) solutions @xmath111,\\quad\\quad[n=2;\\;\\ ; \\lambda_{1}=- \\lambda_{2}].\\ ] ] the left hand side parameters can be considered as the fixed point of the gwm whereas , albeit unstable due to one of its sector , the second set of parameters and couplings defines a new renormalizable color model which is asymptotically safe and does not suffer of lg .",
    "further , this @xmath112 model is not equivalent to the complex gwm @xcite as one can immediately check by expanding the action in real and imaginary parts of the complex field @xmath113 . as a consequence , although being somewhat a vector theory , the complex renormalizable gwm can not be interpreted as a @xmath1 color model in the sense that we have defined it here .    * the model limit @xmath20 . *",
    "as previously claimed , the model limit @xmath20 can be interpreted as a model of polymers with nonlocal repulsing interaction .",
    "using the explicit form of the moyal kernel in position space @xcite , we see that what is suppressed is no longer when the polymer chain crosses itself , as in the usual commutative case , but when four points in the polymer chain sit at the corners of a parallelogram , and the suppression factor is really an oscillation proportional to the area of that parallelogram .",
    "this may seem completely unphysical , but in dimension @xmath114 , the moyal geometry is really the one induced by a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "renormalizable moyal interactions may be selected by a rg process , so that such models may be physically relevant to the growth of two dimensional charged polymers under strong magnetic field .",
    "this model can therefore be thought as some kind of  polymer version \" of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "let us rapidly discuss the features of the @xmath0-function of this model at one loop with respect to the above calculations .",
    "setting @xmath20 in ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam2 ] ) , we have the response @xmath115 still , the trivial problem and lg arises for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) but the model is asymptotically free in the infrared direction , a reminiscent behavior of the ordinary commutative @xmath11 theory .    * the model limit @xmath118 . *",
    "if the index color @xmath16 tends to infinity independently of the matrix indices , we need to rescale the coupling @xmath119 into @xmath120 to get a non trivial limit . a further wick - ordered interaction cancels the tadpoles such that only chain of bubble graphs survive and form an explicit computable geometric series .",
    "we recover thence the usual integrability of the so called spherical model .",
    "the @xmath0-function is obtained by taking the @xmath121 in equations ( [ sigz ] ) and ( [ gamori1 ] ) with adapted constant couplings .",
    "we find @xmath122 @xmath123 the model then is asymptotically free as expected since we had asymptotic freedom for @xmath3 .",
    "far more interesting would be to investigate  double limits \" in which both the matrix indices @xmath124 and the color index @xmath45 are sent to infinity in a coupled way .",
    "this may completely change the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "for instance , we typically no longer have renormalizability in @xmath125 ( unless we also change the propagator dependence on the color index ) .",
    "remark that the crossed vertex @xmath29 is similar to the barrett - crane vertex of the 2 + 1 dimensional group field theory approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "thus , models with such double limits clearly deserves further study .    *",
    "the @xmath2 nc @xmath10 theory .",
    "* by an extension of the previous formulation , we can easily discuss some features of the @xmath2 invariant complex nc @xmath10 model .",
    "let us recall that the ordinary complex gwm has some peculiarities of cyclic orientation and restricted kinds of contractions between @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "given @xmath128 a complex vector field with",
    "complex conjugated @xmath129 , compiling the complex constraints onto a color model , the next vertices are found ( see figure [ fig4 ] for ribbon representations )    , @xmath130 and @xmath131 of the complex model.,width=340,height=132 ]    @xmath132    the @xmath2-version of the action as set in @xcite can be written as , with the matrix operator @xmath133 , @xmath134 the gaussian measure has the same covariance ( propagator ) as in the real theory .",
    "arguments towards the effective expansions and computation of the @xmath0-functions ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) naturally follow . in a similar way that we treated the @xmath1 model ,",
    "we compute , on one side , the self - energy @xmath138 associated with two point amputated 1pi and the wfr @xmath139 and , on the other side , the four point 1pi amputated amplitude @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , in order to evaluate at first order the rg flows @xmath143 where @xmath144 the ribbon graphs in the complex case are very similar to the real case .",
    "however , one has to implement the  skeleton \" with an oriented boundary so that , mainly the @xmath2 ribbons have typically the same structure as in the previous situation .",
    "the graphs @xmath145 s and @xmath92 s , according to complex vertices @xmath146 , have two different orientations",
    ". we will denote the complex tadpoles and four point 1pi graphs by @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the meaning of @xmath149 remaining the same as above , but the index @xmath150 is fixed according to the orientation ( sign @xmath151 is affected to the counterclockwise rotation in the  bubble \" , see for instance figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we find the combinatorial factors ( including sum over colour indices ) and their amplitude sums , with @xmath152 ,     `` bubble '' diagrams.,width=226,height=141 ]     `` bubble '' diagrams.,width=226,height=85 ]    @xmath153    the below expressions are deduced by direct calculation at one loop @xmath154 so that renormalized coupling flows can be inferred @xmath155 keeping @xmath156 fixed to zero , @xmath157 and for @xmath19 , we get @xmath158 and @xmath159 and , consequently , the  parallel \" vertex @xmath36 determines an uv asymptotic freedom while @xmath37 takes the opposite direction of the triviality issue . if we impose the equations @xmath160 , @xmath161 , we find the solutions @xmath162 , \\quad   [ n=2,\\;\\ ; \\lambda_{1}=\\lambda_2=-\\lambda_{\\times}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first set of parameters hints the complex renormalizable gwm @xcite only if @xmath163 . the second set of parameters implies an unstable model in the  crossed \" vertex sector if we assume that @xmath164 , but it is actually a new color model without lg and possessing a fixed point in the rg flow of all of its renormalized coupling constants .",
