    "the question of whether the constants of nature may be dynamical goes back to dirac  @xcite who expressed , in his  large number hypothesis \" , the opinion that very large ( or small ) dimensionless universal constants can not be pure mathematical numbers and must not occur in the basic laws of physics .",
    "he stressed that the ratio between the gravitational and electromagnetic forces between a proton and an electron , @xmath0 is of the same order as the inverse of the age of the universe in atomic units , @xmath1 .",
    "he stated that these were not coincidences and that these big numbers were not pure constants but reflected the state of our universe .",
    "this led him to postulate that @xmath2 varies varies as @xmath3 .",
    "indeed the choice depends the choice of units , either atomic or planck units .",
    "there is however a difference : assuming that only @xmath2 varies violates the strong equivalence principle while assuming a varying @xmath4 results in a theory violating the einstein equivalence principle",
    ". it does not mean we are detecting the variation of a dimensionful constant but simply that either @xmath5 or @xmath6 is varying . ] as the inverse of the cosmic time .",
    "diracs hypothesis is indeed not a theory and it was shown later by jordan  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) that varying constants can be included in a lagrangian formulation as new dynamical degree of freedom",
    "so that one gets both a dynamical equation of evolution for this degree of freedom and a modification with respect to the equations derived under the hypothesis it is constant .",
    "testing for their constancy is a fundamental test of gravitation related to the local position invariance .",
    "it was also realized  @xcite that varying constants may be associated to the existence of a composition dependent fifth force and thus to a violation of the universality of free fall .    in this review talk ,",
    "i first emphasize the necessity to test gravity on astrophysical scales .",
    "in particular , i will discuss what can be learnt from the tests of the constancy of the constants . while it is tested with increasing precisions in the laboratory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , in the solar system and by the study of pulsar timing ( see the contribution by g. esposito - farse in this volume ) , there exist very few tests on astrophysical and cosmological scales  @xcite .",
    "such tests are however required mainly because the cosmic matter budget  @xcite mostly relies on the properties of gravitation , as well as the conclusion that about 96% of the energy density of our universe is dark ( including dark matter and dark energy ) .",
    "i will then review the recent observational and experimental constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant , the gravitational constant and the proton to electron mass ration .",
    "let us stress once again that we are only able to detect the variation of dimensionless constants ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions and i refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for the distinction between fundamental parameters and fundamental units , as well as for their role in the formulation of the laws of physics ) .",
    "to finish , i discuss some developments concerning the phenomenology of varying constants both in the late and early universe .",
    "most cosmological observations now provide compelling evidences that our universe is undergoing a late time acceleration phase , the interpretation of which is still a matter of debate .",
    "in particular , the friedmann equations for a universe filled only with pressureless matter ( including dark matter ) and radiation @xmath7 can not explain the current data  @xcite .",
    "various ways to face this fact have been considered but all lead to the introduction of new degrees of freedom , referred to as _ dark energy _ , in the cosmological scenario , either as new components of gravitating matter or as new properties of gravity .    in the first approach , it is assumed that there exists new gravitating components , beyond the standard model of particle physics , while gravity is supposed to be accurately described by general relativity .",
    "many candidates such as a cosmological constant , quintessence  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite have been proposed ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . from a cosmological point of view",
    ", these models are characterized by their equation of state which can be reconstructed from the function @xmath8 .",
    "note that most late time observations ( such as diameter and luminosity distances or the growth factor of cosmic structures ) only depend on some combination of this function @xmath8 .",
    "the other route is to allow for a modification of gravity which means that _ the long range force that can not be screened is assumed not to be described by general relativity_. many such models have been considered .",
    "for instance , a light scalar field can couple to matter leading to scalar - tensor models of quintessence  @xcite .",
    "this scalar field responsible for variation of the gravitational constant may also be , depending on its couplings , at the origin of the variation of other constants and of a violation of the universality of free fall ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "other possibilities include braneworld models .",
    "higher dimensional models predict that gravity should depart from its standard newton behavior on _ small scales _ and up to now this scale is constrained to be smaller than @xmath9 m  @xcite . among braneworld models , a class has also the feature to allow for deviations from 4-dimensional einstein gravity on large scales .",
    "this is for example the case of some multi - brane models  @xcite , multigravity  @xcite , brane induced gravity  @xcite or simulated gravity  @xcite where gravity is not mediated only by a massless graviton but include a tower of massive gravitons .",
    "the dark sector plays an increasing role in cosmological models . by testing the theory of gravity on astrophysical and cosmological scales",
    "we will strengthen these conclusions .",
    "these tests will contribute to substantiate the physics of the dark sector .",
    "dark matter may be more complicated than a pure collisionless gas and dark energy may require to go beyond a pure scalar field interacting only with gravity . concerning the dark energy phenomenology , the reconstruction of the function @xmath8 will not be sufficient to distinguish between many models ( on which most of the observable  diameter and angular distances , growth of cosmic structures, ...  depend ) so that the precise determination of the late evolution history of our universe , even if very constraining , will not allow us to determine the true nature of dark energy . ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a classification of these models and describes some of the specific signatures that can discriminate between them .",
    "it is recalled in fig .",
    "+ from a theoretical point of view , string theory seems to be the only known promising framework that can reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity , even though it is not yet fully defined beyond the perturbative level .",
    "one definitive prediction drawn for the low - energy effective action is the existence of extra - dimensions and of a scalar field , the dilaton , that couples to matter  @xcite and whose expectation value determines the string coupling constant .",
    "it follows that the low - energy coupling constants are in fact dynamical quantities .",
    "when the dilaton is massless ( or almost ) it leads to 3 effects : ( i ) a scalar admixture of a scalar component inducing deviations from general relativity in gravitational effects , ( ii ) a variation of the couplings and ( iii ) a violation of the weak equivalence principle .    from this perspective , testing gravity may also reveal the existence of further gravitational fields or of extra - dimensions and it opens an observational window on the low - energy limit of string theory and/or on the stabilization of the dilaton and extra - dimensions .",
    "up to now , the observational status concerning the tests of gravity is the following .    1 .   on solar system size",
    ", the newton law as well as the universality of free fall are tested with a very good accuracy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of the constraints ) .",
    "2 .   on galactic scales",
    ", there are a number of astrophysical constraints that a successful modification of gravity will have to face ( see e.g. ref .",
    "if the modification of gravity has some relevance on galactic scales then it will have to explain the flattening of the rotation curves and to account for the dependence of the galaxy rotation curve on the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "this dependence is encapsulated in the tully - fischer relation relating the luminosity of a spiral galaxy to its asymptotic rotation velocity @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "this sets severe constraints on theories in which the cross - over scale with standard gravity is fixed ( see e.g. ref  @xcite ) and favored theories where this cross - over scale depends on the considered galaxy .",
    "roughly , one needs this crossover scale to behave as @xmath12 where @xmath13 m . on the other hand",
    ", the compatibility between x - ray and strong lensing observations tends to show that the poisson equation holds up to roughly 2  mpc  @xcite .",
    "3 .   on cosmological scales",
    ", there is at the moment no direct tests of gravity .",
    "indeed the growth of cosmological structure can put some constraints but usually the observations entangle the properties of the matter and gravity",
    ". both the acceleration of the universe and the variation of the constants ( if confirmed ) may be indications of the break - down of general relativity in this regime .    _",
    "what should we test then ? _ general relativity is based on einstein equivalence principle that includes three hypothesis : ( i ) local lorentz invariance , ( ii ) local position invariance and ( iii ) universality of free fall .",
    "if these hypothesis are valid , it is thought that gravity is a geometric property of spacetime ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we may thus aim to test for both the einstein equivalence principle and the field equations that determine the geometric structure created by any mass distribution .",
    "some tests in these directions have been proposed in the past years .    * _ lorentz invariance : _ it can be tested through the propagation of high energy particles .",
    "a summary of the constraints can be found in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite * _ poisson equation : _ on sub - hubble scales , the einstein equations in an expanding spacetime reduce to the poisson equation @xmath14 that relates the gravitational potential to the density contrast .",
    "it was recently argued  @xcite that the comparison of galaxy catalogs such as sdss or 2df and of weak lensing observations give a direct test of this equation and can be extended up to 100  mpc ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "_ distance duality : _ as long as photons travel on null geodesics and the geodesic deviation equation holds , it can be shown that there is a _ reciprocity relation _ ,",
    "@xmath15 between the source and observer area distances .",
    "indeed @xmath16 can not be measured so that this relation can not be tested . however",
    ", if the number of photons is conserved , it translates to a _ distance duality relation _ between the luminosity and angular distances , @xmath17 that can be tested .",
    "this proposition  @xcite has been tested  @xcite using x - ray and sunayev - zeldovich observations of galaxy clusters and no departure from the standard expectation has been found ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this can constrain e.g. models involving photon - axion mixing  @xcite . *",
    "_ growth of cosmic structures : _ the growth factor of cosmic structures is sensitive to the equation of state of the matter that drives the expansion of the universe  @xcite . it was recently proposed to use the skewness and higher moments of the density field induced during the non - linear newtonian clustering to test for the existence of a long - range yukawa force  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it was argued that this skewness was sensitive to the coupling of dark energy to dark matter  @xcite . * _ testing for the constancy of the ( non - gravitational ) constants _ is a direct test of the local invariance position that makes it a test of einstein equivalence principle and of the strong equivalence principle when the gravitational constant is considered .",
    "it has been investigated by many methods and is the subject of the following section . note that if violated , one expects also a violation of the universality of free fall mainly because the self - energy is composition dependent and gravitates .",
    "since the claim  @xcite that the fine structure constant , @xmath18 , may have been smaller in the past , there have been a tremendous increase in the interest of the fundamental constants of nature and to whether there are really constant .",
    "various reviews  @xcite exist and details and more references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    we review the recent developments concerning mainly the constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant , as well as the proton to electron mass ration , @xmath19 , and the gravitational constant , @xmath2 .",
    "there have been some marked improvements on the constraints on the variation of @xmath18 in laboratory experiments .",
    "these methods are based on the comparison of atomic clocks using different types of transitions in different atoms . according to the comparison",
    ", one can constrain the variation of some combination of fundamental constants .",
    "for instance , the hyperfine transition frequency of alkali can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath19 is the magnetic moment of the nucleus , @xmath21 the nuclear magneton , @xmath22 the rydberg constant and @xmath23 a relativistic function  @xcite which strongly increases with the atom number @xmath24 ( e.g. @xmath25 for @xmath26cs and 0.30 for @xmath27rb ) .",
    "the comparison of hyperfine transitions in @xmath27rb and @xmath26cs over a period of about 4 years took advantage of this sharp variation to show  @xcite that @xmath28 at 1@xmath29 . neglecting possible changes in the amplitude of the weak and strong interactions and",
    "thus in the nuclear magnetic moments , it translates to @xmath30    another experiment  @xcite comparing an electric quadrupole transition in @xmath31hg@xmath32 to the ground - state hyperfine splitting of @xmath26cs over a 3 years period showed that @xmath33 .",
    "this constrains the time variation of @xmath34 so that @xmath35 if both the gyromagnetic factor @xmath36 and @xmath37 are assumed constant .",
    "the comparison  @xcite of the absolute @xmath38 transition in atomic hydrogen to the ground state of cesium combined with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite yields the two independent constraints @xmath39    the comparison  @xcite of optical transitions in @xmath40yb@xmath32 to a cesium atomic clock at two times separated by 2.8 years has shown that @xmath41 which translates to @xmath42 these methods allow to set very sharp local constraints and , as illustrated by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , they can be combined to set independent constraints on various constants",
    ".      sharp constraints on the time variation of the fine structure constant can be also obtained from the oklo phenomenon and from the study of the lifetimes of long - lived nuclei .",
    "+ the oklo phenomenon is a natural nuclear reactor that operated during 200,000 years approximatively two billion years ago , that is at a redshift @xmath43 .",
    "the isotopic abundances of the yields give access to informations about the nuclear rates at that time .",
    "one of the key quantity measured is the ratio @xmath44 of two light isotopes of samarium which are not fission products .",
    "this ratio of order of 0.9 in normal samarium , is about 0.02 in oklo ores .",
    "this low value is interpreted by the depletion of @xmath45 by thermal neutrons to which it was exposed while the reactor was active .",
    "the capture cross section of thermal neutron by @xmath46 @xmath47 has a resonant energy @xmath48  ev , which is a consequence of a near cancellation between electromagnetic and strong interactions  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis and model of the samarium nuclei lead  @xcite , assuming that the variation of @xmath49 is due only to the @xmath18 dependence of the electromagnetic energy , to the constraint @xmath50 at 2@xmath29 .",
    "in particular , the accuracy of the method can be understood by comparing the resonant energy @xmath51  ev to its sensitivity to a variation of @xmath18 , @xmath52  mev so that variation smaller than @xmath53 are expected .",
    "it was later pointed out  @xcite that there may be two ranges of solutions compatible with the oklo data @xmath54 the second branches being disfavored by the analysis of the isotopic ratio of gadolinium .",
    "recently , the assumption that the low energy neutron spectrum is well described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution was investigated  @xcite .",
    "the effect of a variation of the strange quark mass was studied  @xcite to show that @xmath55 has varied by less than @xmath56 while assuming all fundamental couplings to vary independently led  @xcite to the more stringent limit @xmath57 .",
    "+ radioactive decay lifetimes can also be used once the @xmath18-dependence of the decay rate is known .",
    "for instance , the lifetime of a @xmath58- decay nuclei scales as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the decay energy and @xmath61 the sensitivity .",
    "many nuclei were used but the sharpest constraint was obtained from the @xmath58-decay of rhenium to osmium by electron emission @xmath62 first considered by peebles and dicke  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , due its low decay energy about 2.5 kev the sensitivity of rhenium is @xmath63 so that a variation of @xmath18 of order @xmath64 induces a variation decay energy of order of the kev .",
    "the analysis of new meteorite and laboratory led to  @xcite @xmath65 over the last 4.5 gyr , which corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "there is a caveat to this method that is not so direct : the ratio re / os is measured in iron meteorite the age of which is not determined directly .",
    "models of formation of the solar system tend to show that iron meteorites and angrite meteorites form within the same 5 million years .",
    "the age of the latter can be estimated from the @xmath67pb-@xmath68pb method which gives 4.558 billion years .",
    "besides , this constraint holds on the averaged value of @xmath18 over the 4.5 past billion years .      on cosmological scales , the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and of the abundances of the light elements produced during the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) allow to set constraints of order @xmath69 on the variation of @xmath18 .",
    "+ changing the fine structure constant modifies the strength of the electromagnetic interaction and thus its only effect on cmb anisotropies arises from the change in the differential optical depth of photons due to the thomson scattering , @xmath70 , which enters in the collision term of the boltzmann equation describing the evolution of the photon distribution function and where @xmath71 is the ionization fraction ( i.e. the number density of free electrons with respect to their total number density @xmath72 ) . the first dependence of the optical depth on the fine structure constant arises from the thomson scattering cross - section given by @xmath73 .",
    "the second , and more subtle dependence , comes from the ionization fraction .",
    "a variation of the fine structure constant can thus be thought of as considering a delayed recombination model .",
    "early works  @xcite based on boomerang and maxima data tend to show that the fit to cmb data are improved by allowing @xmath74 while landau _",

    "the recent analysis  @xcite of the wmap data ( see the contribution by g. rocha for details ) gave the @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
    "note that he variation of the gravitational constant can also have similar effects on the cmb  @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "constraints of order @xmath79 on the variation of @xmath18 can be obtained from the cmb only if the cosmological parameters are independently known .",
    "+ bbn theory predicts the production of the light elements in the early universe the abundances of which rely on a fine balance between the expansion of the universe and the weak interaction rates which controls the neutron to proton ratio at the onset of bbn .",
    "basically , the abundance of helium-4 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the neutron to proton ratio at the freeze - out time determined by @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ; @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the neutron lifetime , @xmath86 the fermi constant and @xmath87 the time after which the photon density becomes low enough for the photo - dissociation to be negligible . as a conclusion ,",
    "the predictions of bbn involve a large number of fundamental constants .",
    "a change in @xmath18 affects directly @xmath88 and was modelled  @xcite as @xmath89 where @xmath90 determines the weak scale and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are two numbers .",

    "@xcite , confirmed by a recent analysis  @xcite which gives @xmath95 .",

    "the dominant effects  @xcite arise from the variation of the qcd scale , @xmath159 and the weak scales @xmath90 .",
    "in particular it was argued  @xcite that @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "many phenomenological models starting from the investigation by bekenstein  @xcite have been developed  @xcite as well as some braneworld models with varying constant were constructed  @xcite .",
    "damour and polyakov  @xcite proposed to capture the features of loop corrections by modelling them as a genus expansion , that is as a series in the string coupling constant .",
    "the low energy action involves various couplings of the effective four - dimensional dilaton to the different matter fields .",
    "it follows that generically there appear couplings to matter fields via their yang - mills couplings and masses as as a potential for the scalar field .",
    "this construction includes others such as the bekenstein model  @xcite .",
    "note that these models are required in order to compare constraints at various time .",
    "this phenomenology is related to the one of quintessence and the light field responsible for the time variation of the constants may also be the cosmon  @xcite . in that sense , the variation of the constant may shed some light on the physics on dark energy .",
    "initially models of scalar - tensor quintessence  @xcite were considered .",
    "some were using the damour - nordtvedt attraction mechanism toward general relativity to pass the solar system constraints .",
    "the damour - polyakov model  @xcite was generalized  @xcite to a runaway potential so that the light dilaton accounts for the variation of the constants , the acceleration of the universe and is at the origin of a violation of the universality of free fall .",
    "the construction of phenomenological models that tend to explain the small drift of the constant in the late universe by introducing a slow - rolling scalar field have two dangers to avoid .",
    "first , such a light field will obey a klein - gordon like equation , @xmath162 . in order for this field not to oscillate but still be evolving , its mass needs to be very small , typically @xmath163  ev . the question arises of the mechanism that protects it from radiative corrections , a problem common with most quintessence models .",
    "various solutions have been proposed among which the possibility for this field to be a pseudo - goldstone boson  @xcite or to identify this light field with shape modulus  @xcite .",
    "a second danger lies in the violation of the universality of free fall due to the composition dependence of the self energy and of the masses .",
    "this was illustrated in bekenstein original construction  @xcite and was further studied with linear  @xcite and quadratic  @xcite couplings . in the case of a light dilaton , it was shown that if it were to remain massless then it would induce a violation of the universality of free fall seven order of magnitudes larger than the actual bounds  @xcite .",
    "to avoid such a catastrophe , it has either to suddenly take a mass larger than a few mev ( so that gravity will be compatible with einstein gravity above a millimeter ) or decouple from matter  @xcite .",
    "this latter mechanism is analogous to the original damour - nordtvedt attraction mechanism  @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms have different implications concerning the variation of the coupling constants . a fixed point  @xcite or the recently proposed chameleon mechanism  @xcite also claimed to bypass this problem .",
    "a consequence is that the improvement of the tests of the universality of free fall by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude may give some surprises .",
    "inflation universally produces classical almost scale free gaussian inhomogeneities of any light scalars . assuming the coupling constants at the time of inflation depend on some light moduli fields , it was shown  @xcite that modulated cosmological fluctuations are produced during ( p)reheating . this idea was extended to hybrid inflation  @xcite where the bifurcation value of the inflaton is modulated by the spatial inhomogeneities of the couplings . as a result",
    ", the symmetry breaking after inflation occurs not simultaneously in space but with the time laps in different hubble patches inherited from the long - wavelength moduli inhomogeneities . in this model ,",
    "the consistency relation of inflation is modified .",
    "these light field can also be at the origin of non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "if couplings depend on the value of some light fields , then they have most probably developed super - hubble correlations of typical amplitude @xmath164 , simply because the quantum fluctuations of any light field are amplified during inflation .",
    "it follows that one expects spatial variation with these correlation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "they may have some observational effects  @xcite , in particular on the cmb  @xcite polarization and gaussianity .",
    "in conclusion , testing for the variation of fundamental constants is a test of fundamental physics , and in particular of general relativity .",
    "it completes other tests that can be applied on cosmological scales .",
    "such tests are needed to substantiate the physics of the dark sector that plays an increasing role in cosmology .",
    "while observational constraints become sharper , the debate on @xmath18 is not over yet but recent observations have not been able to reproduce the detection of a lower @xmath18 in the past  @xcite .",
    "more important , there now exists a physical model , requiring no new physics , to interpret the supposed variation of @xmath18 as an enhancement of heavy isotopes of magnesium .",
    "we can now hope that the debate will be settled in the coming years .",
    "the future will offer new constraints , particularly with atomic clocks in space ( aces ) , new tests of the universality of free fall ( recent launch of @xmath19scope ) as well as new methods , as illustrated by the recent activity .",
    "these developments will probably shed some light on a possible scalar field acting in the late universe or on some new structures such as higher dimensions . + * acknowledgments * i thank g. esposito - farse , e. flam , p. petitjean and c. schimd for many discussions on this subject , as well as my collaborators in some of the works presented here , n. aghanim , f. bernardeau and y. mellier .",
