    "recent studies of statistical physics models on complex networks have elucidated the effect of heterogeneity in link structure on dynamical properties and critical behavior . for scale - free networks ,",
    "the source of heterogeneity is the broad distribution of node degrees , where node degree is defined as the number of links attached to a node .",
    "this dispersity leads , for example , to a vanishing percolation threshold @xcite , allows epidemics to thrive even with a vanishingly small infection rate @xcite , and causes the ising model to be ordered at all temperatures @xcite .    for many of these models ,",
    "the dynamics can be understood by accounting for the broadness of the degree distribution within a mean - field description . in this article",
    "we show how to implement such an approach for two of the simplest interacting particle systems on heterogeneous networks , namely , the _ voter model _ ( vm ) @xcite and its close relative the _ invasion process _ ( ip ) @xcite , as well as their generalizations to biased evolution @xcite .",
    "for the vm and the ip , each node of an @xmath1-node network can be in one of two discrete states : @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in a social context ,",
    "these states represent two possible opinions of the individual at that node . in a biological context ,",
    "the states represent the phenotype of the individual , with state @xmath7 representing _ resident _ individuals and @xmath8 for _ mutant _ individuals .",
    "the evolution consists of changing the state of a node at a rate that depends on its local environment .",
    "the difference between the vm and ip is in the order in which the `` invader '' node ( whose state is adopted ) and the `` receiver '' node ( whose state changes ) are chosen .",
    "this ordering is immaterial on degree - regular graphs , such as regular lattices , but it plays an essential role on heterogeneous degree networks .",
    "understanding the basic difference between the vm and ip on such graphs is one of the main goals of this work .",
    "we will also study the _ biased _",
    "voter model and the _ biased _ invasion process in which there is a preference for one of the two states .",
    "this generalization describes the evolution of a fitter mutant in an otherwise homogeneous resident population .",
    "we will determine the probability for a single fitter mutant to overspread a population with biased vm and biased ip dynamics .",
    "our main result here is that the probability for a single fitter mutant at a node of degree @xmath5 to overspread a population ",
    "fixation probability_is proportional to @xmath5 for the vm and to @xmath6 for the ip .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we define the models of this paper . in sec .  [",
    "sec : vm - cg ] , we summarize the properties of the vm on the complete graph .",
    "we then investigate the vm on heterogeneous networks in sec .",
    "[ vmk ] , including the complete bipartite graph , the two - clique graph , and general degree - heterogeneous graphs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ip ] , we treat the complementary ip . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : evo ] , we investigate the biased versions of the vm and the ip and determine the fixation probabilities on general heterogeneous networks .",
    "vm evolution consists of the following two steps :    a.   pick a random node ( a voter ) ; b.   the voter adopts the state of a random neighbor .    in the closely related ip",
    "the evolution steps are :    a.   pick a random node ( an invader ) ; b.   the invader exports its state to a random neighbor .",
    "we also mention an intermediate model , _ link dynamics _ ( ld ) , whose evolution steps are :    a.   pick a random link ; b.   one of the nodes on the link , adopts the state of the other end node .    in these models , the time is incremented by @xmath9 in each update .",
    "thus @xmath1 updates corresponds to each node being updated once , on average , after which the time increases by 1 . steps ( i ) and ( ii ) are then repeated _ ad infinitum _ or until the system reaches consensus , an event that is certain to occur in a finite time when the network is finite .",
    "the interpretation of vm dynamics is that individuals lack any self - confidence . in an update ,",
    "an individual therefore consults one of its neighbors and adopts the neighbor s state . on the contrary , in the ip an individual imposes its state to one of its neighbors . here",
    "we can think of the selected individual as replicating , and its offspring invades and replaces the individual at a neighboring node . while the different update details of the three models might appear superficially trivial",
    ", we shall show that these differences are fundamental when the dynamics occurs on degree - heterogeneous networks .",
    "in general , such a network may be specified by its adjacency matrix @xmath10 , with @xmath11 if nodes @xmath12 and @xmath13 are connected , and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "the degree distribution of such a heterogeneous network is specified by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of nodes of degree @xmath5 and @xmath1 is the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "the moments of the degree distribution are then @xmath17 special cases of relevance for the vm and ip are the average degree @xmath18 , the second moment @xmath19 , and the average inverse degree @xmath20 .",
    "normalization also fixes the zeroth moment @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 represent the state of the entire network , and define @xmath23 , which can take the values 0 or 1 , as the state of node @xmath12 . in each update event in the three models , the state of a single node changes from @xmath7 to @xmath8 or vice versa ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",

    "the transition probability at node @xmath12 is @xmath26 =     \\sum_{y } \\frac{a_{x y}}{n\\mathcal{q}}\\,[\\phi(x , y)+\\phi(y , x)],\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] , and the quantity @xmath28\\ ] ] is non - zero only when nodes @xmath12 and @xmath13 are connected ( the factor @xmath29 ) and in opposite states ( expression in square brackets ) , so that an update can actually occur . finally @xmath30 is @xmath31 for the vm , the factor @xmath32 in accounts for first choosing node @xmath12 with probability @xmath9 , and then any of its neighbors @xmath13 with probability @xmath33 .",
    "conversely , in the ip , one first chooses node @xmath13 ( a neighbor of @xmath12 ) with probability @xmath9 , and then one chooses @xmath12 with probability @xmath34 . in ld , each link is chosen with the same probability @xmath35 and then one of the nodes at the end of this link is updated with probability @xmath36 , which then leads to @xmath37 .",
    "as we shall discuss , vm , ip , and ld dynamics are distinct for networks with heterogeneous node degrees .",
    "the above models have been defined as discrete - time processes , where one node is chosen in each update step .",
    "alternatively , these models can be formulated as continuous - time processes by increasing the time by a random increment that is chosen from an exponential distribution with mean @xmath9 .",
    "this stochastic update is equivalent to each update event occurring with unit rate in the three models .",
    "for both discrete and continuous time dynamics , the fixation probabilities and the average time to consensus ( for long times ) are the same",
    ". however , there is an essential difference between discrete and continuous time dynamics for biased models that will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : evo ] .",
    "an important aspect of the vm , ip , and ld is that each model has its own dynamically conserved quantity .",
    "this conservation law determines the fundamental _ exit probability _ @xmath38 , namely , the probability that a finite system with an initial density @xmath39 of @xmath8s reaches a consensus of all @xmath8s .",
    "this quantity is also called the _ fixation probability _ in the biology literature .",
    "the simplest case is ld , for which the state of the system changes only when an active link  where the nodes at the ends of the link are in opposite states  is chosen . because the invader and the receiver are assigned randomly , the probability of increasing or decreasing the number of @xmath8 nodes ( mutants ) are the same .",
    "the dynamics is thus equivalent to a symmetric random walk on the integers , with absorbing states at @xmath40 and at @xmath1 mutants . because of the symmetry of the random walk ,",
    "the initial and final densities of nodes in state @xmath8 are the same .",
    "consequently , the exit probability is @xmath41 this result is also valid for the vm and the ip on degree - regular graphs , due to their equivalence to ld when every node has the same degree .",
    "we now extend eq .   to general networks .",
    "consider the average change in @xmath23 at node @xmath12 , @xmath42 . here",
    "the angle brackets denote the average over all realizations of the update dynamics .",
    "this change equals the probability that @xmath23 increases from 0 to 1 minus the probability that @xmath23 decreases from 1 to 0 . hence @xmath43",

    "hence the summand in the expression on the right is antisymmetric in @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath48 . as a consequence @xmath49",
    "is conserved , so that the mutant fixation probability equals the initial mutant density @xmath39 .    to compute the exit probability on arbitrary networks for general models ,",

    "note that @xmath52 coincides with the density @xmath39 . to obtain a conserved quantity ,",
    "it is clear that the factor @xmath30 in the denominator of the transition rate in must be canceled out . for the vm ,",

    ", both sums vanish so that the conserved quantity in the three models are : @xmath57    we can understand these conservation laws intuitively . for the vm , although nodes are selected uniformly , there are relatively more low - degree nodes that are neighbors of high - degree nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "thus low - degree nodes change their state more often than high - degree nodes .",
    "weighting each node by its degree compensates this disparity and leads to the conserved quantity @xmath58 .",
    "thus the mean density @xmath39 is not conserved , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the vm on heterogeneous graphs .",
    "in contrast , for the ip low - degree nodes change their state less often than high degree nodes , and this disparity may be compensated by weighting each node by its inverse degree .",
    "this leads to the conserved quantity @xmath59 .",
    "since the initial value of the conserved quantity equals its value in the final unanimous state , we obtain , for the exit probability @xmath60 an instructive example is the extreme case of a star graph , where @xmath1 nodes are connected only to a single central hub ( fig .  [ star ] ) .",
    "for the vm , if the hub is in state @xmath8 and all other nodes are in state @xmath7 , then eq .   predicts that the probability of reaching @xmath8 consensus is 1/2 !",
    "thus a single individual with a macroscopic number of neighbors largely determines the final state .",
