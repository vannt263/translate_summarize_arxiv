    "one might assume that a quantitative treatment of symmetry breaking in neutron reactions with heavy nuclei would not be feasible .",
    "however , theoretical approaches exist which exploit the large number of essentially unknown coefficients in the fock space expansion of complicated compound nuclear states in heavy nuclei to perform calculations that can be compared to experiment .",
    "if we assume that it is possible to treat the fock space components of the states as independent random variables , one can devise statistical techniques to calculate , not the value of a particular observable , but the root mean square of the distribution of expected values .",
    "this strategy has been used successfully to understand certain global features of nuclear structure and reactions  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of energy spacings and neutron resonance widths , for example , has been known for a long time to obey a porter - thomas distribution  @xcite in agreement with the predictions of random matrix theory , and statistical approaches have been used to understand isospin violation in heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the compound nuclear states can also amplify the size of the parity - odd asymmetries by several orders of magnitude relative to single - particle estimates .",
    "this large amplification makes it practical to use nuclear parity violation , generically expected on dimensional grounds to possess amplitudes seven orders of magnitude smaller than strong interaction amplitudes , as a new setting to investigate the validity of these statistically - based theoretical approaches .",
    "statistical analyses have successfully been applied recently to an extensive series of measurements of the parity - odd correlation @xmath3 in the a=100 - 200 mass region in neutron - nucleus scattering performed at dubna , kek , and lansce  @xcite .",
    "although the comparison between theory and experiment in this work is still hampered somewhat by the lack of precise knowledge of the weak nn amplitudes and their possible modifications in the nuclear medium , theory and experiment appear to be in agreement at about the 50% level .",
    "given the extreme complexity of the states involved , agreement between theory and experiment at this level must be counted as an overall success for the statistical approach .",
    "parity violation in the gamma decays of nuclei is another example where statistical methods may be employed to estimate observables . in this case",
    "the observables involve the parity - odd correlation @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the neutron spin and @xmath2 is the momentum of the gamma  @xcite . just as for neutron scattering ,",
    "neutron capture on elements with a large number of nucleons produces compound nuclei in highly excited states . these nuclei exhibit a huge @xmath5 number of possible state configurations with different angular momenta and parity and the number of transitions with different amplitudes that the compound nucleus may make to its ground state is correspondingly large as well . because of the large number of energy levels in the compound nucleus , formed by neutron capture , one may hope that the calculation of the mean square matrix elements for the transition amplitudes may also amount to a summation of a large number of uncorrelated random contributions as in the case of the total cross section .",
    "one can then use statistical arguments to estimate the rms value of the parity - odd  asymmetry .",
    "however the case of parity violation in ( n,@xmath6 ) reactions in heavy nuclei is not quite as simple as parity violation in the total cross section for both theoretical and experimental reasons . for the total cross section ,",
    "the amplification of parity violation effects is dominated by the mixing amplitude of the weak interaction , between two compound nuclear states of opposite parity ( in practice s - wave and p - wave compound states ) .",
    "since the total cross section is proportional to the forward elastic scattering amplitude , by the optical theorem , there is only one such contribution for any pair of opposite - parity compound states . for inelastic processes such as the ( n,@xmath6 ) reaction",
    ", however , the weak mixing between compound states can occur in either the initial or final nuclear states , and since these states are distinct in an inelastic reaction there are two possible sources of compound nuclear amplification of the parity - odd effect rather than one  @xcite . because of the large density of states in the initial state near neutron separation energy , the initial state mixing will involve a larger number of components in the wave function for gamma transitions to low - lying states and therefore lead to a larger amplification .",
    "however one also has contributions from transitions to higher - lying states where final - state mixing is somewhat more important .",
    "experimentally , precise measurements of parity - odd asymmetries are more practical for the total integrated gamma spectrum rather than individual gamma transitions . but a calculation of the asymmetry of the integral gamma spectrum requires an additional averaging over the large number of distinct final states .",
    "in addition the integral measurement also senses gamma cascades in addition to single transitions .",
    "parity - odd correlations in the integrated gamma spectra of @xmath7cl , @xmath8br , @xmath9cd , @xmath10sn , and @xmath11la have previously been calculated by flambaum and sushkov  @xcite and by bunakov et .",

    "we have performed a simple statistical estimate of the mean square value for the parity odd asymmetries in these nuclei and obtain expected upper bounds which are consistent with experiment .",
