    "the histogram curves are normalized in order to enclose the same integral area .",
    "gaussian fits are added as guides to the eye .",
    "obviously , the height histogram of graphene is broader exhibiting a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.78 nm , while sio@xmath0 exhibits a fwhm of only 0.48 nm . while the latter value is quite robust across the surface , the former value is changing by about 25 % across the surface , but is on average larger than the fwhm on sio@xmath0 .",

    "representative scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images of the tips provided by the supplier are added as insets .",
    "they are cross - checked by sem images after the measurements .",
    "these images are in agreement with the supplier images , but due to a moderate background pressure , the ultrasharp w - tip fastly burnt away during sem imaging . the left afm image is measured by a cantilever with a si tip having an apex radius of about 10 nm , while the right afm image is measured with a w tip of nominal tip apex radius of 1 nm mounted at the bottom of the si tip .",
    "both images exhibit a very similar lateral scale of the corrugation .",
    "the rms values are 220 pm and 270 pm , respectively , showing that the tip properties do not significantly change the observed corrugation of the substrate .",
    "we cross - checked this result using more than ten images obtained with both tips , which lead to fluctuations in rms values of less than @xmath25 10% .",
    "figure [ figs3 ] shows a comparison of the correlation functions of the topographic images of graphene ( top row ) and sio@xmath0 ( bottom row ) .",
    "the left column shows the correlation functions directly obtained from the topography .",
    "the middle and right column show the high - frequency and low - frequency part of the correlation function separated by a smooth first - order butterworth filter with cutoff wavelength @xmath20 nm . while the large wavelengths visible in the right columns are quite similar in both images , the rather regular short wavelength pattern ( middle column ) is only observed on graphene .",
    "note that correlation functions within the same columns are scaled to the same contrast , i.  e. , their brightness is directly comparable .",
    "figure [ figs4 ] shows three images ( top row ) obtained in different areas of the monolayer graphene , separated by several @xmath9 m .",
    "they exhibit different rms values of 270 pm , 220 pm and 360 pm ( left to right ) , respectively .",

    "notice that the scales of the images are different .",
    "while the long - range corrugation ( middle row ) is oriented in different directions , the short range corrugations ( bottom row ) exhibit the same wave length of about 15 nm in all three areas and show a similar orientation as marked by the white lines .",
    "the latter indicates that the the short - scale corrugation is related to the atomic directions in graphene .",
    "but since the directions of the rippling are fluctuating slightly across the sample similar to the orientations of molecules in liquid crystals , more data are required in order to substantiate the relation between atomic directions and preferred directions of rippling .",
    "figure [ figs5 ] shows topographic images of different areas of the sio@xmath0 substrate ( top row ) and the corresponding correlation functions ( bottom row ) .",
    "they exhibit similar length scales of corrugation but clearly different orientations , which might be due to the polishing procedure of the sample .",
    "figure [ figs6 ] shows the radially averaged fourrier transforms ( ft ) of the topographic images of graphene ( black curve ) and sio@xmath0 ( grey curve ) .",
    "the ft curves are based on images of the same lateral size and resolution .",
    "the curves are averaged using 10 images of 200 @xmath24 200 nm@xmath7 from different areas of the surfaces . obviously , the corrugation of sio@xmath0 is larger at large wave length ( small wave number ) down to 30 nm by up to 66 % , while the corrugation on the graphene is larger at smaller wavelengths ( larger wave numbers ) by up to a factor of 2.6 .",
    "the individual fts of different sio@xmath0 areas are nearly indistinguishable , i.e they are not deviating from the width of the grey curve in fig .",
    "5 . however , the fts of different graphene areas are shifted vertically due to the fluctuating rms value of corrugation , which leads to crossing points of the two curves varying between wavelengths of 20 nm and 40 nm .",
    "importantly , all of the graphene curves show one crossing point with the averaged sio@xmath0 curve .        in order to observe the influence of the graphene film morphology on raman scattering , we compared raman spectra ( laser wave length 532.1 nm ) , taken in identical experimental conditions , of a monolayer flake which is partly suspended and one that follows the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ figs7 ] ) .",
    "the surface structure of these samples was determined using stm measurements ( insets fig .",
    "[ figs7]a ) .",
    "the raman spectra were recorded before and after the stm measurements giving the same result .",
    "a difference between both spectra regarding the positions of the 2d and g peaks is clearly visible .",
    "the wave number of the 2d peak is 2686.7 @xmath26 for the partly suspended graphene flake and 2670.5 @xmath26 for the flake following the substrate .",
    "hence , it results that the change in morphology causes a shift of the 2d peak by 16.2 @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ figs7]a ) .",
    "a similar effect was observed at the g peak which is shifted by 5.5 @xmath26 to lower values for the flake following the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ figs7]b ) .",
    "the d peak ( about 1350 @xmath26 ) is barely visible for both samples indicating a good quality of our graphene .",
    "raman spectra of several of our graphene samples ( about 15 ) prepared in nominally identical conditions show more frequently a non shifted 2d line with an average value of 2692.4@xmath275.3 @xmath26 .",
    "hence , we conclude that our samples mostly exhibit intrinsic rippling .",
    "if we compare with wave numbers of the 2d line within the literature using only the data taken with a similar laser wave length ( 514 - 532 nm ) @xcite , we find 2680 - 2700 @xmath26 .",
    "hence , we believe that the majority of samples investigated so far exhibit intrinsic rippling as displayed in the right inset of figure 7a ."

    "<S> using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in ultra high vacuum and atomic force microscopy , we investigate the corrugation of graphene flakes deposited by exfoliation on a si / sio@xmath0 ( 300 nm ) surface . while the corrugation on sio@xmath0 is long - range with a correlation length of about 25  nm , some of the graphene monolayers exhibit an additional corrugation with a preferential wave length of about 15  nm . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis shows that the long range corrugation of the substrate is also visible on graphene , but with a reduced amplitude , leading to the conclusion that the graphene is partly freely suspended between hills of the substrate . </S>",

    "<S> since it was believed , based on the mermin - wagner theorem , that two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals are not stable at finite temperature @xcite , it came as a surprise that monolayer graphene could be stabilized on a si / sio@xmath0 substrate @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the lateral wavelength of the isotropic curvature is estimated to be @xmath1  nm with an amplitude of @xmath2  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the rippling has been reproduced theoretically by monte - carlo simulations with a preferential wavelength of 8 nm barely depending on temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes in graphene causes the rippling and is responsible for the stability of the 2d crystal . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been shown experimentally that rippling can ultimately limit the mobility of graphene at 300 k , if defects are avoided @xcite    however , the corrugation properties of graphene deposited on a substrate as typically used in transport experiments are not clarified . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , we find that the long - range corrugation implied by the substrate has lower amplitude on graphene than on sio@xmath0 suggesting that our high - mobility graphene is partly suspended between hills of the substrate , which might favor the development of the intrinsic short - scale rippling .    </S>",

    "<S> this highlights that tiny details of the preparation process can have large impacts on the physical properties , maybe explaining the contradicting weak localization properties in different studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of raman data of several samples indicates that samples with intrinsic rippling are more frequent than samples without @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future systematic studies using our method to determine the intrinsic rippling are required .    in summary </S>",

    "<S> a mesoscopic corrugation decreasing in amplitude with increasing thickness not induced by the substrate is identified . </S>",
    "<S> it is rather regular exhibiting liquid - like correlation properties with a preferential wavelength of about 15  nm and a rms roughness of 0.32  nm . since the long - range corrugation of the substrate is additionally visible on graphene , but with smaller amplitude than on the substrate </S>",
