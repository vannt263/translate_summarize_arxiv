    "several biological processes that sustain life depend crucially on the catalytic activity of enzymes . a simple reaction mechanism for enzyme - catalysed reactions was first proposed in 1913 by michaelis and menten@xmath1 following the work of wurtz , henri and several others.@xmath2 according to the michaelis - menten ( mm ) mechanism , enzyme @xmath3 binds with substrate @xmath4 to form an enzyme - substrate complex @xmath5 , which either dissociates irreversibly to form product @xmath6 , regenerating the free enzyme @xmath3 or dissociate reversibly to release the substrate : @xmath7 in the above mechanism , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the forward and backward rate constants for reversible substrate binding and substrate release steps respectively and @xmath10 is the rate constant for irreversible product formation and enzyme regeneration step .",
    "the classical mm kinetics , based on deterministic mass action kinetics , estimates the temporal variation of the concentrations of enzyme , enzyme - substrate complex and product once the initial concentrations are known.@xmath11 the deterministic nature of kinetics implicitly assume that all enzymes react at the same time to form products in bulk . in the steady - state , therefore , the initial rate of product formation is given by the classical michaelis - menten ( mm ) equation , @xmath12_{0}[s]}{[s]+k_m},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the enzyme velocity . in the above expression , @xmath14_{0}=[e]+[es ] $ ]",

    "this transformation , suggested by lineweaver and burk@xmath20 in 1934 , is widely used to obtain the kinetic parameters of enzyme - catalyzed biochemical reactions .",
    "a crucial step in the michaelis - menten mechanism is the binding of the enzyme with a substrate to from an enzyme - substrate complex , dissociation of which leads to the formation of product .",
    "an enzymatic conformational state is , however , not fixed but undergoes incessant fluctuations due to random collisions with the surrounding solvent molecules .",
    "the latter impart enough thermal energy to the enzyme to pass through the energetically unfavourable transition states that separate different conformational states . in an enzyme catalyzed reaction , therefore , different conformational states of an enzyme or an enzyme - substrate complex represent different kinetic intermediates which can interconvert between each other on time scales slower or faster than the product formation ( or enzyme turnover ) time.@xmath21 how does the rate of enzymatic conformational fluctuations influence the turnover time of a single enzyme ? does the mm kinetics of a single fluctuating enzyme shows deviation from the classical mm equation",
    "? do these fluctuations about the mean turnover time represent irrelevant random noise or carry useful information about the mechanistic pathway that can be characterized quantitatively ?",
    "these are some of the questions that have just begun to be addressed in several recent studies on single - enzyme catalysis.@xmath22    in a recent single - enzyme turnover experiment based on fluorescence spectroscopy,@xmath23 the turnover time for the repeated turnover of @xmath0-galactosidase has been measured over a long time interval . from the frequency of occurrence of turnover times ,",

    "is found to be greater than unity at high substrate concentration .",
    "this difference is attributed to conformational fluctuations in both the enzyme and the enzyme - substrate complex and to the possibility of both parallel and off - pathway mm kinetics .    in the past few years",
    ", the randomness parameter has found widespread use as a new kinetic parameter to characterize temporal fluctuations in single - enzyme kinetics.@xmath25 the randomness parameter , which is the dimensionless ratio of the variance and the square of the mean @xmath26 , provides a statistical measure of temporal fluctuations in the underlying mechanism in terms of the number of kinetic intermediates in the reaction pathway and their connectivity with respect to each other.@xmath27 interestingly , a reaction mechanism with @xmath28 sequentially connected kinetic states , @xmath29 , where occupancy time for each kinetic state is assumed to be exponentially distributed @xmath30 , always yields @xmath31 for going from @xmath32 to @xmath33 state.@xmath34 here , @xmath28 represents the number of rate determining steps in a sequential mechanism with the same rate constant @xmath35 .",

    "the opposite limit of @xmath39 , on the other hand , implies off - pathway states as in inhibited enzyme mechanism.@xmath40 the randomness parameter can become greater than unity even when product formation occurs via parallel - pathway mechanism due to enzymatic interconversion .",

    "exactly recover the mm kinetics in the absence of enzymatic fluctuations . in the presence of these fluctuations , however , the parallel and off - pathway mechanisms show strikingly different variations of the mean turnover time , and the randomness parameter , with substrate concentration .",
    "further , the individual contributions of enzyme and enzyme - substrate fluctuations in the parallel - pathway mechanism are clearly discerned from the variation of the randomness parameter with substrate concentration . from our general analysis",
