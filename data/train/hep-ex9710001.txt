    "the use of scintillating fiber detectors has some advantages compared to other detector principles in terms of spatial and time resolution , robustness of the detector , match to different shapes , radiation hardness , etc . @xcite .",
    "examples for the advantageous use of fiber detectors under very different conditions are the d0 experiment , chorus @xcite and the h1 forward proton spectrometer @xcite .    the fiber detector under discussion is aimed to be a tracking device , with time characteristics according to the bunch crossing time of the accelerator of 96ns .",
    "the spatial resolution is required to be about 100@xmath0 m .",
    "the fiber detector should be of such a granularity , that an occupancy of a few percent is reached .",
    "the structure and readout of the detector has to be constructed in such a way , that up to four events per bunch crossing can be registered with an overall charged particles multiplicity of more than 100 .",
    "the scintillating fibers should not change their characteristics significantly after an irradiation of 1@xmath32mrad .",
    "all these demands and the solutions presented below match to a possible application of the fiber detector as the inner tracker in the hera - b project at desy @xcite .",
    "the fiber detector would consist of 48 one - dimensional detector planes , some of them operating in a magnetic field of about 0.8 t .",
    "a plane consists of four quadrants of 25@xmath125@xmath2 each . the available space and the magnetic field conditions demand the light collection from the scintillating fibers by means of light guides of a length of about 2@xmath33 m .",
    "the readout of the scintillating fiber detector is assumed to be realized by multichannel photomultipliers ( pspm ) of hamamatsu type r5900 - 00-m64 with 64 pixels per device .",
    "this photomultiplier is still under development , only a few prototype examples exist .",
    "the characteristics are similar to the 16 pixel devices used for our investigations .",
    "the test and characteristics of this pspm are not more subject of this paper .    in chapter 2",
    "the optical properties ( light yield , attenuation length and coupling efficiency ) and radiation hardness of various fiber materials are dicussed .",
    "+ in chapter 3 the results obtained for fiber detector prototypes in a test run at a 3 gev electron - beam are presented . for different fiber bundels efficiency and spatial resolution were determined by means of reference detectors .",
    "+ the development of the technology for the large scale production of fiber detectors is described in chapter 4 .",
    "all measurements were performed with standardized fiber samples of 30 cm length and a cross section of 2@xmath12mm@xmath4 independent of the fiber diameter , which varies between 0.25 mm and 0.50 mm .",
    "fibers of three producers ( bicron , kuraray , pol.hi.tech . ) were investigated , whereby the wavelength of the emitted scintillation ligth covered the blue and green spectral regions .",
    "all investigated fibers have a double cladding , which leads to an increased light trapping efficiency .",
    "the sample was connected to two philips photomultipliers ( pms ) xp2020 , s1 and s2 . below the fiber sample a scintillator ( 5 mm thick and 10 mm width ) was installed .",
    "it was readout by two pms philips xp1911 , t1 and t2 , from each side .",
    "the sample was exposed to a @xmath5 source .",
    "a collimator with variable slit width was mounted between source and fiber sample .",
    "the amplitude spectra were measured by an adc , if a trigger signal occured , derived from a coincidence between s2 , t1 and t2 .",
    "the setup was calibrated so that the number of photo - electrons ( pe ) could be estimated .",
    "the results are related to the bialkaline photo - cathod of the pm xp2020 which is similar to the bialkaline photo - cathode of the multi - channel pm forseen for later application .",
    "the results for a sub - sample of fiber materials of 0.5 mm diameter are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "generally , it is seen that the light yield decreases with increasing scintillator emission wavelength because the pm s sensitivity curve is not unfolded .",
    "there is no remarkable difference between the best materials of the three producers and the light yield is typically 4.5pe per 1 mm scintillator ."
