    "in past few decades , network science has discovered a plethora of novel phenomena while trying to mimic real world systems in a better manner .",
    "one of such discovery is an observation of the chimera state .",
    "it was first reported by kuramato et .",
    "al . in 2002 while investigating non locally coupled identical oscillators in a ring network  @xcite .",
    "later , it was analyzed and christened by abrams and strogatz in 2006 as chimera state  @xcite .",
    "like , its counterpart in greek mythology , a chimera state has come to be referred as a mathematical hybrid state in which coherent and incoherent dynamics coexist in non - locally coupled identical oscillators in a structurally symmetric network .",
    "chimera has been extensively investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in plenty of networks including phase oscillators @xcite , chemical @xcite , mechanical oscillators @xcite , neuron models @xcite , planar oscillators @xcite , boolean networks @xcite , 1d superconducting meta material @xcite , etc .",
    "chimera was originally reported for non - locally coupled oscillators , recently it has been reported in feed back delayed networks @xcite , globally coupled networks @xcite , time varying networks @xcite and networks with purely local coupling @xcite . moreover , different types of chimera has been reported including multi cluster chimera @xcite , virtual @xcite , breathing @xcite and two dimensional chimera @xcite .",
    "a recent work suggests emergence of chimera , dependent on nonhyperbolicity of dynamical systems for both the time - discrete and time continuous cases @xcite .",
    "the chimera state has also been reported for various real world networks models such as rosenzweig - macarthur oscillators for ecological networks @xcite .",
    "chimera has also been characterized by the state of the dynamical evolution of the network .",
    "i chimera is characteristic of the hyper chaotic behavior with many positive lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "this type of chimera has primarily been observed for time - continuous systems like complex ginzburg - landau oscillators or kuramoto oscillators . in type - ii chimera ,",
    "only spatial chaos has been observed with a rather simple temporal behavior ( mostly periodic ) .",
    "though , this type of chimera has been reported mainly for the time - discrete systems ( maps ) @xcite , it has recently been observed for the time - continuous stuart - landau oscillators as well @xcite .",
    "further , modeling real world complex systems under the multiplex network framework is one of the recent advancements in the network theory @xcite .",
    "we consider a multiplex network consisting of the same nodes across the layers ( fig .  [ fig.mul_pic ] ) and investigate the occurrence of chimera state in the multiplex ring networks .",
    "in this structure , each node has exactly the same connection architecture .",
    "we observe type - ii chimera with spatial chaos and periodic temporal behavior .",
    "though , the chimera state , upon multiplexing , remains of the same type as observed for the isolated network , the multiplexing changes the region of incoherence .",
    "dependence of the chimera state on initial conditions is observed for the multiplex networks as already observed for the isolated networks .",
    "additionally we present a measure in terms of distance variable to distinguish between the coherent and the chimera state and to identify the transition point for the coherent - incoherent bifurcation .",
    "we also investigate role of the size of the network in determining the critical coupling strength for the symmetry breaking and thus emergence of the chimera state .",
    "we consider a multiplex @xmath6 ring network with n nodes in each layer , where @xmath6 represents one dimensional symmetric cyclic group with elements being invariant to the permutation operation @xcite . considering @xmath7 as a real dynamical variable at time @xmath8 for the @xmath9 node",

    "the diagonal entries @xmath19 represents no self connection in the network .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath20 for the multiplex network can be written as , @xmath21 where @xmath22,@xmath23, ... ,@xmath24 represent the adjacency matrix of the first , second, ",
    ",@xmath25 layer , respectively and @xmath26 is an unit nxn matrix .",
    "note that the number of nodes in each layer of the multiplex network is same .",
    "a mismatch in the network size of the layers will yield nodes in different layers having different interaction patterns and hence we can not define the chimera state .",
    "we use logistic map @xmath27 with the bifurcation parameter @xmath28 at which individual logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior .",
    "we consider coupling radius @xmath29 for each layer indicating degree of each node being 64 .",
    "a state of the network is defined as spatially coherent if for any node @xmath30 , the spatial distance between the neighboring nodes approaches to zero for @xmath31 @xmath32 geometrically , this signifies a smooth profile of the spatial curve .",
    "smoothness of the curve , signifying the correlated spatial values of the neighboring nodes , is defined with the absence of any discontinuity in the spatial curve . whereas , temporal coherence ( synchronization ) is defined as , @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , temporal coherence can be written as @xmath35 which leads to a straight line for the spatial curve associated with the temporal coherence .",

    "[ eq.evol ] starting with a set of special initial conditions and after an initial transient , study the spatio temporal patterns of the multiplex network .",
    "note that uniform or the gaussian distributed random initial conditions lead to either a completely coherent , spanning all the nodes , or a completely incoherent state depending upon the coupling strength .",
    "for @xmath46 leads to the incoherent evolution of all the nodes . motivated from @xcite",
    ", we use a hump back function to generate initial conditions as follows .",

    "the same initial condition is used for both the layers in the multiplex network .",
    "a very narrow width of the function leads to almost very close value of the initial conditions for a fraction of nodes leading to the coherent state .     and @xmath42",
    ". number of nodes @xmath41 for each layer.,width=336,height=192 ]    in the absence of any coupling between the nodes ( @xmath51 ) or for weak couplings , all the nodes evolve independently and no spatial coherence is observed .",

    "[ fig.main](a ) , for @xmath36 , the evolution of the nodes in the multiplex network yields an incoherent state with no correlations in the neighboring nodes . as the coupling strength is increased ,",
    "a partially coherent state emerges at @xmath37 with correlated spatial values of the neighboring nodes in the end and in the middle regions of each layer , however , the spatial range of the incoherent region is more than the coherent region ( fig .  [ fig.main](b ) ) .",
    "this coexistence of the coherent and incoherent dynamics corresponds to the chimera state in the multiplex network .    .",
    "figure are plotted for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , width=336,height=192 ]    the dynamical behaviour of two layers of a multiplex network is a replica of each other manifesting exactly the same spatio - temporal patterns ( fig .",

    "exactly same behaviour is observed for multiplex networks having more than two layers ( fig.[fig.mul_lay ] ) .    at the same coupling value , the spatio - temporal dynamics ( fig .  [ fig.main ] ( g ) ) reflects non - regular skeletal type pattern in the incoherent regions .",
    "this irregularity of the pattern suggests that , in the multiplex network framework , a node may get attracted to either of the upper or lower region depending on its initial value as reported for the isolated network @xcite .",
    "as we increase the coupling strength further , range of the incoherent region decreases as depicted by fig .",
    "[ fig.main](c ) for @xmath52 . at @xmath45 ,",
    "we observe a sharp discontinuity in the otherwise smooth profile of @xmath53 and the incoherency appears at two distinct points in each layer .",
    "this is a bifurcation point for the coherent - incoherent transition . above this coupling value",
    ", all the nodes in the multiplex network acquire the complete coherent state as indicated by the appearance of a smooth geometric profile at @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.main](e ) ) .",
    "fig.[fig.main ] depicts spatial regions of incoherent nodes and thus indicates a non - zero spatial entropy with the periodic temporal dynamics , representing a type ii chimera state .",
    "further , the regions of incoherence in the spatial profile continues to exist for narrower intervals with an increase in the coupling strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig.main ] ) .    furthermore ,",
    "in the chimera state , the time evolution of all the nodes in the network depict periodic behaviour with the periodicity two depicting temporal regularity .",
    "the coupled dynamics displays the spatial chaos which is defined by the non - zero spatial entropy given by @xmath54 @xmath55 , where @xmath56 represents fraction of the incoherent nodes in network @xcite .",
    "we show that the distance measure ( eq.[eq.dmsr ] ) is able to easily distinguish between coherent and chimera state . the discontinuous spatial profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dismsr1](b ) ) at @xmath45 gives rise to the kinks ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dismsr1](d ) ) in the distance measure distribution signifying transition to the chimera state .",
    "we calculate the spatial entropy as a function of the coupling strength ( @xmath11 ) in order to demonstrate the transition between the chimera to the coherent state .",
    "a transition from the chimera to coherent state is indicated by the discontinuous change in spatial entropy of the network ( fig.[fig.trans ] ) .",
    "ring of multiplexed network are shown .",
    "parameters are @xmath57 and @xmath42 . number of nodes @xmath41 for each layer .",
    "initial transient is taken as 5000 .",
    "results are presented for time range 5000 to 5015.,width=345,height=192 ]    in order to see the impact of multiplexcity on the dynamical behavior of nodes , we compare the dynamical state of an isolated 1d lattice with that of the multiplexed with another 1d lattice .",
    "we find that while the chimera state is retained after multiplexing , the dynamical evolution of the network differs .",
    "the multiplexing may enhance or suppress the incoherency .",
    "for instance , at @xmath38 , the isolated network displays the chimera state with incoherence in the middle regions of the spatio temporal pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mul_effect ] ( a ) and ( c ) ) . after multiplexing",
    ", the region of incoherence shrinks to a point discontinuity in the middle and intermediate regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mul_effect ] ) .",
    "thus , multiplexing here retains the chimera state as well as the type of the chimera state , but leads to a change in the region of incoherence as well as in the dynamical evolution .",
    "rings for different realizations of the initial conditions . parameters are @xmath58 and @xmath42 .",
    "number of nodes @xmath41 for each layer .",
    "initial transient is taken as 5000 .",
    "results are presented for time range 5000 to 5015.,width=307,height=192 ]    furthermore , similar to the isolated networks , in the multiplex networks as well , the chimera exhibits dependency on the initial conditions .",
    "as already discussed in the section iii , the spatial profile displayed by the chimera state can be very different for different profile of initial conditions for the same set of control parameters , namely @xmath59 and @xmath13 .",
    "but interestingly , even for the initial condition given by the same profile as eq .",
    "[ ini_eq ] with a constant value @xmath49 for a given network size @xmath60 , different realizations of the initial conditions can lead to a different incoherent regions .",
    "for example , at @xmath38 , for three different realizations of the initial conditions , all given by eq .",
    "[ ini_eq ] , three different spatio temporal patterns are observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : initial ] ) .",
    "though , the multi - chimera state is evident for all the realizations , the region of incoherence differs without any consistent behavior .",

    "network size @xmath64 and coupling range @xmath42 in each layer.,width=307,height=192 ]    moreover , we investigated the impact of network size on emergence of chimera state as well as on the critical coupling strength below which one observes incoherent - coherent regime .",
    "[ fig : n_size ] presents chimera state for a multiplex ring network with two different network size .",
    "for both the network sizes , the coupled evolution exhibits the coexistence of coherence - incoherence dynamics .",
    "however , the critical coupling strength for the coherent - incoherent bifurcation increases to @xmath67 ( fig.[fig : n_sizemsr ] ) as compared to @xmath68 for network size @xmath69 as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig.main ] .",
    "to summarize , we report an emergence of the chimera in the multiplex networks with the layers being represented by 1-d lattice architecture having non - local couplings .",
    "we find that an emergence of the chimera is identical in the mirror layers arising due to the underlying symmetry of the network .",
    "furthermore , while the temporal behavior of the network remains periodic even after multiplexing , the range of the coupling strength for which chimera is observed changes . the chimera in the multiplex network is found to be sensitive to the changes in the initial conditions , which is revealed through the changes in the incoherent region of the dynamical evolution for different sets of initial conditions .",
    "we also show that the critical coupling strength increases with the size of the network .",
    "the results presented here may provide a better understanding to the peculiar nature of the chimera state observed in many natural systems like unihemispheric sleep , ventricular fibrillation , brain networks which incorporates multilayer network architecture @xcite .",
