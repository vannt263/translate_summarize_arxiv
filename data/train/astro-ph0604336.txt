    "symbiotic stars are a class of interacting binaries consisting of a hot component ( usually a white dwarf ) which ionizes the stellar wind of a cool component ( generally a red giant or mira , see kenyon 2000 ) . with typical component separations of @xmath5150@xmath7 , these complex systems are responsible for some of the most dramatic galactic jet sources @xcite .",
    "ch cyg is one of the most enigmatic symbiotic stars ",
    "previous to 1963 , ch cyg showed no variable behavior and was actually used as a m6iii spectral type calibrator ( see kenyon 2001 , for background details  on ch cyg s properties ) . since 1963 , ch cyg has gone through multiple outbursting phases , producing bipolar radio jets in 1984 @xcite , 1992 @xcite , and 1998 @xcite , as well as x - ray jets @xcite , and large ionized outflows ( @xmath810@xmath0  in size ,  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "b band flickering studies also point to the existence of an unstable accretion disk around the hot white dwarf component @xcite .",
    "the ch cyg system contains at least one red giant / white dwarf pair @xcite . currently , there is ongoing debate @xcite as to whether the ch cyg system is binary or the only known symbiotic triple star ( consisting of either a red giant / white dwarf pair with a g star companion @xcite or a red giant / white dwarf pair with an additional red giant companion @xcite ) . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we adopt the interpretation of the ch cyg system as an inner red giant / white dwarf pair with a period of 756 days @xcite and an outer red giant with a period of 14.5 years @xcite .",
    "all three stars are viewed nearly edge on and the outer giant periodically eclipses the inner binary .    as an unresolved triple system ,",
    "ch cyg is very difficult to study . in order to completely understand the system it is necessary to disentangle the contribution of each component to the behavior of the system as a whole .",
    "most studies of ch cyg focus on the contribution of the hot white dwarf component to the system ",
    "jets @xcite , ionized outflows @xcite , and hot component disk flickering @xcite primarily trace the properties of the hot component and the matter accreting on to it .",
    "in fact , the hot component dominates the total source properties at many wavelengths  to study the cool components , it is important to find a wavelength at which the cool components dominate over the hot component . to this end , we chose to study ch cyg at mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) wavelengths , where the contribution of the hot component is negligible ( @xmath95@xmath10 of the total emission , even during active periods ) .",
    "while near - ir and mid - ir photometry has previously been undertaken for ch cyg ( taranova & shenavrin 2000 , 2004 ; bogdanov & taranova 2001 ) , ch cyg has not previously been resolved at these wavelengths , since sufficient spatial resolution at mid - ir wavelengths has not been available until recently ( close et al .",
    "2003 , biller et al .",
    "2005 ) . using the novel technique of adaptive optics at mid - ir wavelengths",
    ", we can directly image the emission from the cool component of the system by itself for the first time and study any circumstellar material on finer spatial scales than before .",
    "data were taken on the night of 2003 may 13 ( ut ) at the 6.5 m mmt using the adaptive secondary mirror ao system @xcite with the blinc - mirac3 camera ( hoffman et al .",
    "1998 ; hinz et al .",
    "currently all other existing ao systems use a warm reimaged adaptive mirror and require several additional warm optical surfaces between the secondary and the detector . with the unique mmt adaptive secondary ,",
    "we remove many of these warm optical surfaces from the optical path compared to a standard ao system .",
    "this results in a considerably reduced thermal background at the mid - ir , thus making adaptive optics possible for mid - ir observations .",
    "the adaptive secondary corrected the first 52 system modes and achieved strehl ratios as high as 0.97@xmath60.03 from 8.8 to 18@xmath2 .",
    "these strehl ratios are the highest ever presented in the literature for a large ground based telescope ( close et al .",
    "2003 , biller et al .",
    "2005 ) . for details on the mmt adaptive secondary ao system ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we utilized the 128@xmath11128 sias bib 220@xmath2 mirac3 camera @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12/pixel scale was used with the 9.8 and 11.7@xmath2 10% bandwidth filters . to remove thermal and detector instabilities we chopped at 1hz with an internal pupil - plane cold chopper in the interface dewar blinc @xcite between the ao system and mirac3 .",
    "we observed with the ao system locked continuously on ch cyg .",
    "the @xmath13 tilted blinc dewar window is a high quality dichroic which reflected the visible light ( @xmath14@xmath91@xmath2 ) to the ao wavefront sensor and transmitted the ir through blinc to mirac3 .",
    "since the internal chopper in blinc was past the dichroic , continuous 1hz chopping did not affect the visible light beam and hence the ao lock was unaffected . to further calibrate the background ( in addition to chopping ) we nodded @xmath568@xmath0 in the telescope s azimuth direction ( the horizontal direction in figure [ fig : images ] ) every minute .",
    "the internal chopper was set to run in the altitude direction ( the vertical direction ) with a chop throw of @xmath520@xmath0 .",
    "the derotator was disabled during these observations to help minimize the residual background structure .",
    "the @xmath15 pa=269@xmath16 washington double star catalog astrometric binary wds 02589 + 2137 bu was observed during a later run ( 2003 , november 25 ut ) and used to calibrate the camera s orientation and its @xmath12/pixel platescale .    for the 9.8 and 11.7@xmath2 filters we obtained 2@xmath111 minute coadded chop differenced images ( one image from each nod ) for ch cyg .",
    "we utilized a custom iraf script to reduce this mid - ir data @xcite .",
    "the script produced two background subtracted images by subtracting the image taken at the first nod position with that taken at the second , and vice versa .",
    "images were then bad pixel corrected , flat - fielded , cross - correlated , and aligned to a reference nod image ( to an accuracy of @xmath80.02 pixels ) .",
    "mid - ir images of the psf calibration stars ( @xmath3 uma and @xmath4 her , both of these stars are binary but appear unresolved to mirac , see close et al .  [",
    "2003 ] for a discussion of psf suitability ) were obtained and reduced in an identical manner to ch cyg . reduced images of ch cyg and",
    "the two psf stars are presented in figure[fig : images ] . in order to directly compare our science images with the psf images",
    ", we have not rotated the images to place north up ",
    "azimuth is vertical and altitude is horizontal . at the time of the observations , the parallactic angle ( pa )",
    "was roughly 160@xmath16 .",
    "the ch cyg images appear slightly yet significantly extended compared to images of the two psf stars . to highlight this extension",
    ", we present one - dimensional normalized cut plots in both altitude and azimuth directions across the peak for the 9.8 and 11.7@xmath2 images of ch cyg and psf star @xmath3 uma in figures[fig : cutplots9.8 ] and [ fig : cutplots11.7 ] .",
    "three rows / columns were averaged together for each cut plot to increase signal to noise . since ch cyg is a very bright object ( 565jy at 12@xmath2 ) and errors are dominated by photon noise , error bars for these plots are considerably smaller than the size of the plot symbols and have not been plotted . in all the altitude and azimuth cutplots at 9.8 and 11.7@xmath2 , the ch cyg profiles are noticeably extended compared to those for the @xmath3 uma psf .",
    "we measured the fwhm , ellipticity , and positional angle of any such ellipticity for all the images in figure[fig : images ] , as well as for images of rv boo , an agb star with a small extended dust disk observed the same night @xcite . in figure[fig : fwhm ] we plot the ellipticity and fwhm for our datasets .",
    "ch cyg has a similar eccentricity but a significantly higher fwhm than the psf stars .",
    "thus , ch cyg looks clearly extended compared to the psf stars .    in order to detect the gas counterpart to the mid - ir emitting dust",
    ", ch cyg was observed in the co(10 ) transition at the arizona radio observatory 12 m telescope on kitt peak on the night of 29 june 2005 .",
    "no co(10 ) was detected in 4 hours of integration time .",
    "in order to study small - scale circumstellar structure around ch cyg , we deconvolved our high s / n ( s / n@xmath171000 ) images of ch cyg using both the psf stars @xmath3 uma and @xmath4 her ( see biller et al .  2005 , for details on psf star selection ) with the iraf lucy deconvolution task @xcite . so as not to introduce noise amplification artifacts due to deconvolution , we deconvolved images for only 10 iterations .",
    "to test whether artifacts were being introduced by the lucy algorithm , we also deconvolved images of the @xmath3 uma psf with those of the @xmath4 her psf in order to establish the expected result of deconvolving one point source by another point source .",
    "deconvolved images of ch cyg and the psf stars appear in figure[fig : deconvim ] . due to the very high strehl ( @xmath50.98 ) and high signal - to - noise ratio in our psf images",
    "we could detect low contrast structure on `` super - resolution '' scales of @xmath50.2@xmath0 with the iraf lucy deconvolution task @xcite .",
    "after deconvolution , ch cyg still appears significantly extended compared to the deconvolved psf images .    to estimate the size of the extension around ch cyg , we convolved a range of simple gaussian dust envelope models ( with fwhms of 0.1 , 0.14 , 0.15 , 0.16 , 0.18 , and 0.2@xmath0 before convolution ) with the @xmath3 uma psf .",
    "we determined the best fit model by comparing model cut plots with data cut plots ; the best fit model minimizes the standard deviation of [ _ cutplot_(data)-_cutplot_(model ) ] . at 9.8@xmath2 ,",
    "the 0.15@xmath0 model provided the best fit to the altitude cut plot , while the 0.14@xmath0 model provided the best fit to the azimuth cut plot . at 11.7@xmath2 ,",
    "the 0.17@xmath0 model provided the best fit to the altitude cut plot , while the 0.16@xmath0 model provided the best fit to the azimuth cut plot .",
    "best fit model cut plots are presented in figures[fig : cutplots9.8],[fig : cutplots11.7 ] . the slightly broader cut plot profile along the altitude direction in both these cases is probably due to instrumental effects and is not physical . utilizing the hipparcos distance of @xmath5270pc , we adopt a fwhm at 9.8@xmath2 of @xmath540.5@xmath62.7au ( 0.15@xmath60.01@xmath0 ) , and a fwhm at 11.7@xmath2 of 45.9@xmath62.7au ( 0.17@xmath60.01@xmath0 ) .    we scaled and subtracted the best fit gaussian model ( convolved with the @xmath3 uma psf ) from the data in order to reveal any asymmetric structure .",
    "images of residual asymmetric structure are presented in figure[fig : resids ] .",
    "the residual structure peaks in intensity @xmath50.5@xmath0 north of the star ( marked by a diamond ) and is roughly coincident with the extension seen by @xcite at @xmath50.7@xmath0 north of the star in hst wfpc2 images ( marked by the letter a in fig .",
    "[ fig : resids ] ) .",
    "the structure also appears to be extended along a similar axis to the radio / optical jets .",
    "since the residual asymmetric structure we observe around ch cyg is faint compared to the symmetric gaussian structure ( peak fluxes only @xmath52@xmath10 that of the symmetric component ) we have concentrated our modeling efforts on the symmetric component only .",
    "we model the ir emission of ch cyg as an optically thin shell passively heated by the star .",
    "we approximate the stellar photosphere by the kurucz ( 1979 ) model spectrum for m6iiie stars with an effective temperature of @xmath18=3000@xmath19 .",
    "the dust is taken to be amorphous silicate since ch cyg is a m star .",
    "taking all grains to be spherical with @xmath20 being their spherical radius , we assume a power - law dust size distribution @xmath21 which is characterized by a lower - cutoff @xmath22 , upper - cutoff @xmath23 and power - law index @xmath4 .",
    "for simplicity , we take @xmath22=0.01@xmath2 since smaller grains will undergo single - photon heating , and @xmath23=1000@xmath2 since larger grains are not well constrained by the currently available ir photometry .",
    "we approximate the dust spatial distribution with a modified power - law @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the inner boundary of the envelope which we take to be the location where silicate dust sublimates . for ch cyg with a luminosity @xmath26",
    ", submicron - sized silicate dust achieves an equilibrium temperature of @xmath27 and starts to sublimate at @xmath28",
    ". therefore we take @xmath29 .",
    "this functional form has the advantage that on one hand , it behaves like a power - law @xmath30 at larger distances ( @xmath31 ) , and on the other hand it peaks at @xmath32 , unlike the simple power - law which peaks at @xmath25 .",
    "the latter is unphysical since one should not expect dust to pile up at @xmath25 where dust sublimates !",
    "we take @xmath33=2 as expected from a stationary outflow with a constant mass loss rate ( e.g. see habing , tignon , @xmath34 tielens 1994 ) .",
    "but other @xmath33 values have also been considered ( see below ) , in view of the time - variable nature of this object .",
    "we take @xmath35=200@xmath7 which is large enough for our ir emission modeling purpose since there is very little dust beyond this outer boundary which emit at the wavelengths we are interested ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "therefore , we have only two free parameters : @xmath4  the power - law exponent for the dust size distribution and @xmath37  the dust spatial distribution parameter which determines where the dust peaks .    using the dielectric functions of `` astronomical silicates '' ( draine & lee 1984 ) and mie theory ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) , we calculate the absorption cross sections of amorphous silicate grains as a function of size , as well as their equilibrium temperatures as a function of radial distance from the central star ( in thermal equilibrium with the illuminating starlight ) .",
    "we then obtain the dust model ir emission spectrum by integrating the dust emission over the entire size range and the entire envelope .    the model spectrum",
    "is then compared with ( 1 ) the 9.8@xmath2 and 11.7@xmath2 photometry from our mmt ao images , ( 2 ) the 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100@xmath2 iras ( _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ) broadband photometry , ( 3 ) the 7.722.7@xmath2 mid - ir low - resolution spectroscopy obtained with the iras _ low resolution spectrometer _ ( lrs ; with a resolution of @xmath38 ) , ( 4 ) the 2.545@xmath2 near- to mid - ir high - resolution spectroscopy obtained with the _ short wavelength spectrometer _ ( sws ; @xmath39 ) on board the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , and ( 5 ) the 43197@xmath2 mid- to far - ir medium - resolution spectroscopy obtained with the iso _ long wavelength spectrometer _",
    "( lws ; @xmath40@xmath41150200 ) .",
    "given that ch cyg is a variable star , it is to our great surprise that these observational data taken at different time epochs are in reasonably good agreement with each other : the mmt - ao and iras fluxes are only @xmath512% and @xmath525% , respectively , smaller than the iso sws flux ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the sws spectrum is also in close agreement with the k , l , and m photometry .",
    "but the iras lrs flux is lower than the sws spectrum by a factor of @xmath516 .",
    "we therefore take the iso sws and lws spectra as the comparison basis and increase the mmt - ao fluxes , the iras broadband fluxes , and the iras lrs spectrum by a factor of 1.12 , 1.25 and 16 , respectively .",
    "this brings the mmt - ao and iras data into agreement with the iso data .",
    "the model which best fits the observed ir emission spectrum and photometric points has @xmath424.1 and @xmath4310 ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) , with the dust distribution peaking at @xmath44 , a total visual optical depth @xmath45 , and a total dust mass @xmath46 .",
    "it is not easy to translate the total dust mass into the mass loss rate which is actually considered as one of the most important tasks in the study of stellar evolution ( e.g. see willson 2000 ) . to estimate the mass loss rate of ch cyg",
    ", we need to assume a gas - to - dust mass ratio @xmath47 and a gas outflow velocity @xmath48 . with @xmath47=100 and @xmath48=@xmath49 (",
    "based on the velocity of the ca - ii absorption component which , according to skopal et al .",
    "1996 , is likely associated to the expanding circumstellar wind ) , we estimate the mass loss rate of ch cyg to be @xmath50 .    in order to compare the best fit model directly to our mmt ao images",
    ", we convolved the model radial profile with our ao psf image of @xmath3 uma .",
    "after convolution , the best fit model to the observed ir emission spectrum and photometric points produces an image appreciably larger than the mmt ao image .",
    "we have considered models with a grid of parameters ( @xmath37=220 , @xmath33=14 , @xmath51=25250au ) . while multiple models fit the ir emission spectrum reasonably well , none of the models is able to simultaneously replicate the ao image and the observed ir emission .",
    "for instance , the best fit model to the ir emission spectrum ( @xmath424.1 and @xmath4310 ) has a fwhm @xmath8 0.4  at 9.8 @xmath3 m ( after convolution with the ao psf ) , while the ao image of ch cyg has a fwhm @xmath9 0.37  .",
    "given the extremely high strehl ratios during these observations ( @xmath8100@xmath10 ) and the resultant high image fidelity , this is a significant divergence !",
    "these models are likely too simple to fully describe this complex system .",
    "the models assume only one star , with a steady state outflow .",
    "however , the ch cyg system contains 3 stars  we have not taken into account the disruptive effects upon the dust of the other two stellar components of this system .",
    "the assumed functional form for the dust spatial distribution may be too simplified .",
    "we should also note that , as a variable star , the spatial and size distributions of the dust ( which determine the surface brightness distribution of the dust shell around ch cyg ) at the epoch when the ao images were taken can be quite different from those when the iras photometry and the iso spectroscopy were obtained . as a result",
    ", it is very unlikely that a dust model will fit both the observed ir emission spectrum and the ao images .",
    "thus this is not a test of the validity of the model .",
    "circumstellar dust in the ch cyg system has previously been studied by taranova and collaborators . with near- and mid - ir photometric observations ,",
    "@xcite follow the properties of a circumstellar dust envelope around ch cyg . according to @xcite s model , mass",
    "was injected into the cool component s circumstellar dust envelope around 1983 by an as yet unknown mechanism , coincident with the bipolar radio outflow observed by @xcite .",
    "the optical depth of the dust envelope increased through 1992 . by 1996 , the dust envelope began to dissipate and had decreased to pre - mass injection optical depths by 2001 .",
    "taranova & shenavrin ( 2000 , 2004 ) model the circumstellar dust envelope of ch cyg as a single temperature shell around the cool component which varies in size and total dust mass during mass injection episodes . from 1983 to 2003",
    ", they claimed that the dust shell radius varied between @xmath510@xmath5210@xmath53 cm , or from about 770au ( but bogdanov & taranova [ 2001 ] argue for a much large extension : 1515000au ) .",
    "we observe ch cyg to be similarly extended , with a fwhm of @xmath54046au .",
    "the symmetric extended dust structure around ch cyg is considerably larger than the orbits of the stellar components . in order to estimate the semimajor axis of the inner 756 day period binary , we adopt a white dwarf / hot component mass of @xmath50.2@xmath54 and a red giant / cool component mass of @xmath52@xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we calculate a semimajor axis estimate of @xmath52au . to estimate the semimajor axis of the outer 14.5 year period binary , we adopt an outer red giant mass of @xmath52@xmath54 and find a semimajor axis estimate of @xmath510au .",
    "the observed dust envelope extension of @xmath54046au is larger than both the inner and outer binary orbits .",
    "thus , the dust envelope contains all three stellar components of this system .",
    "the fact that all three stellar components of this system lie within the dust envelope may be significant in explaining why our ao dust shell images diverge from our spherically symmetric dust envelope models  possibly , the stellar components of this system have a hand in shaping the dust envelope into something other than a classic , red giant wind spherical shell .",
    "however , whatever specific contribution the stellar components have had on the shape of the dust envelope remains unresolved and unquantified .    after subtracting out the symmetric component of the emission ,",
    "the residual emission appears extended along a similar north - south axis to those of the radio jets reported by @xcite .",
    "the residual structure peaks in flux @xmath80.5@xmath0 north of the star and is roughly coincident to the knotlike structure observed by @xcite at 0.7@xmath0 north of the star in hst wfpc2 images ( marked by the letter a in fig.[fig : resids ] ) .",
    "the structure also appears to be extended along a similar axis to the radio / optical jets , and is similar to the extent of the radio jets and ionized optical structure .",
    "however , while bipolar structure is observed in both the radio and optical , the mid - ir structure is unipolar .",
    "one possible explanation is that mid - ir emitting dust is denser towards the northern lobe of the bipolar outflow .",
    "the outflow shocks and heats the dust towards the north , hence a bright mid - ir dust structure is observed . towards the south , the outflow is unimpeded by dust and , thus , has a larger optical and radio extent , but no mid - ir counterpart .",
    "the combination of adaptive optics with a deformable secondary produces very high strehl images in the mid - ir and high psf stability regardless of the seeing , airmass , or target brightness .",
    "such psf stability allows us to determine object properties with very high fidelity .",
    "adopting the hipparcos distance to ch cyg of @xmath5270pc , we found a nearly spherically symmetric extension with a fwhm at 9.8@xmath2 of @xmath540.5@xmath62.7au ( 0.15@xmath60.01@xmath0 ) and a fwhm at 11.7@xmath2 of @xmath545.9@xmath62.7au ( 0.17@xmath60.01@xmath0 ) . after subtracting out a model of the spherically symmetric emission , we found residual extension @xmath50.5@xmath0 north of the star roughly coincident with the optical knotlike feature observed by @xcite .",
    "adaptive optics at mid - ir wavelengths is a very promising new technique that allows for uniquely stable psfs and high strehls .",
    "a high degree of psf stability will eliminate morphological ambiguities due to poor ( seeing - limited ) psf calibrations .",
    "mid - ir ao should have a significant impact on any field where mid - ir imaging is possible .",
    "these mmt observations were made possible with the hard work of the entire center for astronomical adaptive optics ( caao ) staff at the university of arizona .",
