    "combined hii region and pdr modeling of normal and starbursting galaxies have demonstrated that pdrs account for more than half of the [ cii ] emission in these sources ( e.g. colbert et al .",
    "strong shocks could boost the [ oi ] emission relative to [ cii ] .",
    "however , the measured [ cii]/[oi ] ratio of 2.5@xmath221.2 is well above 1 , suggesting we can ignore the role of shocks in this case .",
