    "<S> the topological transition serves as a key observable indicator for the presence of the weyl point with quantized nonzero berry flux . in terms of the 2d dirac equation </S>",

    "<S> 2(c ) shows the calculated topological phase diagram as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath7 , confirming the robustness of the band crossing . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , increasing @xmath29 shifts the crossing to longer wavelengths  but the transition necessarily occurs at a particular wavelength , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this robustness reflects the topological protection of the weyl point in the 3d band structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we prove the existence of the weyl point in two distinct experiments : ( 1 ) by observing conical diffraction associated with the conical isofrequency surface of a type ii weyl point  @xcite ; and ( 2 ) by observing the fermi arc surface states that emerge from the weyl point .    since the isofrequency cut of the type - ii weyl point is a 2d dirac cone ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> conical diffraction is observable over a continuous range of probe wavelengths .    to demonstrate conical diffraction , we excite the system by injecting light into a single waveguide at the input facet , which then couples through a waveguide splitter to a pair of neighboring waveguides ( within one unit cell at the center of the lattice ) with equal intensity and phase . </S>",

    "<S> 3(a - c ) . for lattice constants </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 and @xmath20 , for which the floquet band structure is in a conventional insulator and topological insulator phase respectively , we observe a filled - in disc - like diffraction pattern , which is characteristic of band edge modes . </S>",

    "<S> 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from a perfect ring occur because the lattice is discrete , which makes it impossible for the light to reside on a perfectly circular and zero - width ring . additionally , the diffraction pattern is distorted by the square symmetry of the lattice , which induces a saddle point in the quasienergy at the brillouin zone edge . fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 3(a - c ) .    to quantify the observation of conical diffraction </S>",
    "<S> , we define a dimensionless parameter that measures the degree to which the diffraction pattern is conical : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the distance from the origin ( the origin is defined to be the center point between the two excited waveguides ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath37 measures how `` ring - like '' a wavefunction is , and is reminiscent of the inertial moment of a rotating body in a mechanical system ( but is dimensionless in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> it takes the value 1 for an infinitely thin ring , and is larger than 1 for all other patterns . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(g - i ) we plot @xmath37 against wavelength for the three previous lattice constants , namely @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the monotonic behavior of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(g ) and 3(i ) show that for lattice constants @xmath39 the weyl point does not occur within the wavelength range of the tunable laser ( @xmath40@xmath41 ) , or is very near the boundary ( i.e. , the gap is small but does reach zero ) . </S>",

    "<S> 2(h ) corresponds to conical diffraction ( see figs . </S>",

    "<S> the conical diffraction associated with conical isofrequency surface provides direct evidence of the existence of the type - ii weyl point .    </S>",
    "<S> as stated earlier , the weyl point in the 3d band structure corresponds to a topological transition in the ( 2 + 1)d floquet band structure . to study this </S>",
    "<S> , we use the fact that the topologically trivial phase of the lattice ( large @xmath29 ) should have no edge states , whereas the topologically nontrivial phase ( small @xmath29 ) has chiral unidirectional edge states . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by injecting light via a single waveguide along the top edge of the lattice , and observing the evolution of the wavepacket . the first row of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> most of the light stays confined to the edge and proceeds in a clockwise sense , an indicator of the chiral edge state . in fact , the topological phase observed here is anomalous  @xcite , in the sense that despite the presence of a chiral edge state , the single band in the 2d floquet band structure has chern number zero . </S>",
    "<S> its associated topological invariant is described in detail in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> full - wave beam - propagation simulations that correspond to the cases shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> corresponding edge band structures are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(k - o ) , indicating the transition from trivial to topological regimes . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the band structures show that states confined to opposite edges ( marked in red and blue ) emerge after the topological transition at the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> this acts as a further piece of evidence of the existence of the weyl point at the transition between the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> note that we can also see the topological transition by varying @xmath7 instead of @xmath29 , as shown by the phase diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ; we have chosen to vary the latter to make the trend more obvious , since the dirac gap is strongly dependent on @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the edge states observed here also constitute the `` fermi arc '' surface states that are predicted to emerge from weyl points  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the dispersion diagrams shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(m - o ) for the edge states in the transverse @xmath45-plane are equifrequency contours of fermi arc states occupying the surface of the 3d structure . </S>",
    "<S> their observation at the weyl point can be taken as further experimental evidence of the presence of the weyl point .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us discuss the robustness of our method for identifying weyl points in 3d based on the ( 2 + 1)d floquet band structure of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> for the ( 2 + 1)d system , we have taken the paraxial limit , which means assuming that the two propagation directions ( @xmath46 ) and polarization degrees of freedom ( @xmath47 ) are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> however , weyl points are protected because they carry a quantized topological charge ( chirality or berry flux ) ; they can only be destroyed by annihilating with a weyl point of opposite charge . since our system has time - reversal symmetry , reversing the propagation direction yields another weyl point , with the opposite sign of @xmath48 , but identical charge and frequency  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the weyl points in the orthogonal polarization not only have identical charges , but they are also split along the @xmath48 axis as a result of the structural birefringence of the individual waveguides , which have elliptical cross - sections ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> this structural birefringence is quantified as the difference in the waveguide propagation constant for the two polarizations . using a full diagonalization of maxwell s equations </S>",

    "<S> numerical simulations reveal that this occurs outside the range of our laser , but is accessible using shorter lattice periods . for example , in a lattice of period @xmath50 the band gap closes and the edge modes terminate at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> our weyl point pair is separated in frequency , which is a generic property of type - ii weyl points  @xcite , but not realized in previous weyl photonic crystal designs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a degenerate partner weyl point of opposite charge has some interesting applications ; for instance , one could couple a localized emitter to the chiral weyl dispersion , and exploit the fact that the dirac point in the floquet hamiltonian is _ unpaired _ , implying the lack of coherent backscattering and anderson localization in the presence of disorder  @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have made the first direct experimental observations of a weyl point at optical frequencies , which is a type - ii weyl point . </S>",
