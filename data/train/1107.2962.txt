    "among the several aspects of the study of the iron - based superconductors that are still controversial and unsettled ,  @xcite the following two questions have attracted considerable attention : _",
    "( i ) _ does the magnetic order observed in the parent compounds@xcite arise from the nesting properties of the non - interacting ( or high temperature ) fermi surface@xcite or should a better description be based on the superexchange heisenberg interactions between localized magnetic moments?@xcite _ ( ii ) _ what is the pairing mechanism , to what extent is the pairing symmetry determined by nesting and , what is the actual symmetry and momentum dependence of the pairing operator ?",
    "in particular , what is the role that the orbital degrees of freedom play in this context ?    the origin of the magnetic state is being vigorously debated .",
    "one proposal , based on fermiology , is the excitonic mechanism in which electron - hole pairs are formed by one electron and one hole from different fs s nested with nesting vector @xmath5 . in this context",
    "some studies disregard the orbital structure of the bands@xcite while others stress the role played by their orbital composition.@xcite another approach focuses on the order of the localized moments that develop in the presence of strong coulomb interactions@xcite and relies on ab initio results@xcite that suggest that the pnictides are moderately , rather than weakly , correlated , conclusion supported by photoemission measurements indicating mass enhancements due to electron correlations as large as 2 - 3.@xcite    the pairing mechanism in the pnictides is also controversial .",
    "most of the pairing operators that have been proposed in the literature either ignore the multi - orbital characteristics of the problem or consider cooper pairs that are made out of electrons located at the same orbital . a majority of these previous studies have been performed in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the original proposal of the @xmath6 pairing state dealt with the overall symmetry of the pairing operator but without distinguishing among the spatial vs. orbital contributions to its particular form.@xcite other authors  @xcite have considered a spin - fluctuation - induced pairing interaction and also assumed that cooper pairs are predominantly made of electrons in the same orbital . a random - phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "analysis  @xcite concluded that the pairing is , again , intraorbital , both for the a@xmath7 ( @xmath4-wave ) and b@xmath7 ( @xmath8-wave ) symmetries . among the authors that have used the conceptually different strong coupling approach ,",
    "some have studied effective single orbital models  @xcite while others incorporated two orbitals ,  @xcite but still only considering intra - orbital pairing operators .",
    "the same model was also studied under a mean - field approximation  @xcite with the assumption that exchange takes place between spins on the same orbitals and , again , only intraorbital pairs were proposed .    among the early first studies of multiband superconductors ,",
    "et al._@xcite considered two tight - binding bands , hypothetically identified with @xmath4 and @xmath8 orbitals , and the effect of weak electron - phonon interactions . under these assumptions ,",
    "it was reasonable to expect that the cooper pairs would be formed by electrons belonging to the same band .",
    "however , the actual orbital composition of the pairs was not addressed .",
    "the interacting portion of the hamiltonian was written in the band representation and this model was proposed by analogy with models used in the bcs theory , assuming that emission and absorption of a phonon could occur in four ways .",
    "these four processes corresponded to pair scattering within each of the two fs s and pair hopping from one fs to the other .",
    "this last process would occur if the exchanged phonon has enough momentum to allow the cooper pair to jump from a fs to the other , and it can occur even if the orbitals do not hybridize to form the bands.@xcite in this case , the expected pairing operator is the traditional on - site @xmath4-wave state of the bcs theory , with a momentum independent gap . in principle , independent gaps may arise on the different fss@xcite unless the orbitals are hybridized by the symmetries of the hamiltonian , in which case the gaps will have to be related to each other and obey the symmetries of the system.@xcite    the previous discussion applies to superconductors driven by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "however , it is believed that the most relevant interactions in the pnictides are the coulomb repulsion and hund magnetic exchange .",
    "these interactions are more easily expressed in real space and in the orbital representation .",
    "in fact , the effective form of the coulomb interaction in the band representation is more complicated than the expression provided by suhl _",
    "et al._@xcite for the electron - phonon interaction . in particular , it has been shown  @xcite that a pair hopping term , such as the one introduced by suhl _",
    "_ occurs only if the orbitals get hybridized to form the bands .",
    "if the orbitals are @xmath9 hybridized this type of term is not present in the effective interaction hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , when the bands are made of hybridized orbitals , as it is the case for the iron pnictides,@xcite the actual orbital structure of the pairs needs to be considered since due to the coulomb repulsion on - site pairing is not expected to occur , and the overall symmetry properties of the pairing operators may be a function of their spatial and orbital components .",
    "@xcite    to understand the role that the orbitals play in the case of electrons with strongly hybridized bands that are interacting via the coulomb repulsion , as believed to occur in the case of the pnictides in the context of the magnetic scenario for superconductivity , in this manuscript we present and discuss lanczos numerical , hartree mean - field , and rpa studies of two different two - orbital models , both displaying identical fermi surfaces .",
    "one of them is the well - known and widely used two - orbital model for the pnictides@xcite based on the two strongly hybridized degenerate d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 orbitals of iron , while the second is a two - band `` toy- model '' ( dubbed the @xmath4-model ) whose bands arise from two non - hybridized , non - degenerate , @xmath4-like orbitals that is introduced here for the first time .",
    "the latter model has a fs qualitatively similar to that of the pnictides . in both cases a hole",
    "( electron ) fs is located at the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) points of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the hole and electron fs s are connected by nesting vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the role that the nesting and the orbitals play in the magnetic and pairing properties of these models will be here investigated and discussed , both in the weak and strong coupling regimes .    besides its conceptual relevance",
    ", the results presented here should also be framed in the context of recent bulk - sensitive laser angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite on bafe@xmath12(as@xmath13p@xmath14)@xmath12 and ba@xmath15k@xmath16fe@xmath12as@xmath12 .",
    "the main conclusion of ref .   is the existence of orbital independent superconducting gaps that are not expected from spin fluctuations and nesting mechanisms , but are claimed to be better explained by magnetism - induced interorbital pairing and/or orbital fluctuations .",
    "this is argued based on the observation that the @xmath17 orbital that forms one of the hole pockets at the bz center , but that does not have a nested partner with the same orbital at the electron pockets , nevertheless appears to develop a superconducting gap .",
    "another interesting experimental result that challenges the role of nesting in the physics of the pnictides is a careful measurement of the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect in bafe@xmath12p@xmath12 , the end member of the series bafe@xmath12(as@xmath18p@xmath19)@xmath12 , indicating that this non - magnetic and non - superconducting compound displays the best nesting of all the compounds in the series.@xcite    the manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",

    "since the two orbitals are degenerate , an important detail is that the direction along which each orbital is defined is actually arbitrary .",
    "two directions have been used in the literature : @xmath22@xcite with the @xmath20 and @xmath21 axes along the directions that connect nearest - neighbor iron atoms , and @xmath23@xcite with the @xmath24 and @xmath25 axis rotated 45@xmath26 with respect to the @xmath27 set . in terms of the d@xmath2 and d@xmath3",

    "however , if the degenerate @xmath8-orbitals are expressed in terms of the @xmath38 axes as @xmath39 , then the tight - binding dispersion becomes:@xcite @xmath40\\tau_0\\\\ -(t_1-t_2)(\\cos k_x - \\cos k_y)\\tau_1-\\\\ 4 t_4\\sin k_x \\sin k_y \\tau_3 . \\end{split } \\label{xydis}\\ ] ]    notice that the @xmath41 basis is chosen just for the orbitals while in real space the system of coordinates is still given by @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath42 also has to transform as a@xmath7 which means that , when the orbitals are defined in the @xmath38 basis , then @xmath35 transforms as b@xmath7 , and @xmath37 as b@xmath36 .",
    "it can be shown that since @xmath35 is the matrix that indicates inter - orbital electron hopping , this kind of hopping happens between nearest - neighbors [ next - nearest - neighbors ] in the @xmath38 [ ( @xmath22 ) ] representation .    as previously discussed , if the values of the parameters are set to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 then the fermi surface ( shown in fig .",

    "while the values of the hopping parameters in the hamiltonian are crucial to achieve nesting in weak coupling,@xcite systems in which nesting is not perfect can develop stripe - like magnetic order if they map into a @xmath177@xcite model in the strong coupling limit such as in the case of the three - orbital model for the pnictides.@xcite        -0.5 cm [ 3orb ]    the results in this section indicate that in the case of the pnictides , even if the five @xmath8 orbitals are considered , the @xmath178 and @xmath179 orbitals are the most likely to produce the strongest contribution to the metallic stripe magnetic order at weak or intermediate values of the hubbard interaction because they are the major constituents of the fs s with better nesting and because they are degenerate and , thus , there is no energy @xmath54 that needs to be overcome by the interaction .",

    "<S> to understand the role that degeneracy , hybridization , and nesting play in the magnetic and pairing properties of multiorbital hubbard models we here study numerically two types of two - orbital models , both with hole - like and electron - like fermi surfaces ( fs s ) that are related by nesting vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in one case </S>",
    "<S> the bands that determine the fs s arise from strongly hybridized degenerate d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 orbitals , while in the other the two bands are determined by non - degenerate and non - hybridized @xmath4-like orbitals . using a variety of techniques , in the weak coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that only the model with hybridized bands develops metallic magnetic order , while the other model exhibits an ordered excitonic orbital - transverse spin state that is insulating and does not have a local magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> however , both models display similar insulating magnetic stripe ordering in the strong coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that nesting is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of ordered states with finite local magnetization in multiorbital hubbard systems ; the additional ingredient appears to be that the nested portions of the bands need to have the same orbital flavor . </S>",
    "<S> this condition can be achieved via strong hybridization of the orbitals in weak coupling or via the fs reconstruction induced by the coulomb interactions in the strong coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> this effect also impacts the pairing symmetry as demonstrated by the study of the dominant pairing channels for the two models . </S>"
