    "quantum simulators  @xcite are currently designed with a one - to - one approach , which implies a one - to - one correspondence between the hilbert space dimensions of the simulated system and the simulating architecture .",
    "key examples of this approach involve the quantum simulation of black holes in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , relativistic quantum mechanical problems  @xcite and quantum phase transitions  @xcite in optical lattices , many - body systems with rydberg atoms  @xcite , the quantum rabi model  @xcite and quantum relativistic dynamics  @xcite in superconducting circuits .",
    "similar efforts have been invested in trapped - ion technologies for simulating spin models  @xcite , relativistic scattering processes  @xcite , and interacting fermionic and bosonic theories including quantum chemistry problems  @xcite . in this way ,",
    "one - to - one quantum simulators allow us to reproduce the dynamics of a variety of quantum mechanical models .",
    "however , performing a reliable quantum simulation does not grant efficient and direct experimental access to parameters of interest as , for example , entanglement monotones  @xcite . the usual methodology in quantum simulations",
    "reads : ( a )  implementation of a certain quantum evolution , ( b ) infer information about the system via state tomography , and ( c ) compute classically relevant physical quantities out of the inferred system density matrix . given",
    "that state tomography becomes exponentially harder with an increasing number of qubits , the one - to - one approach scales unfavorably .",
    "thus , one may be misled to the conclusion that we are limited to scenarios where figures of merit can be directly or efficiently measured .",
    "for instance , a physical quantity such as the concurrence  @xcite , or its generalization to @xmath0 qubits  @xcite , is not an observable because its definition involves an antilinear operation .",
    "we have the same situation with the negativity  @xcite , requiring partial transpose operations .",
    "these entanglement measures need full state tomography , which becomes unfeasible for rapidly growing hilbert - space dimensions . in this context , embedding quantum simulators ( eqs ) provide a mathematical framework for the efficient computation of a class of physical quantities that otherwise would require full state reconstruction  @xcite , enhancing the capacities of one - to - one quantum simulators .    in this letter",
    ", we provide an experimental quantum simulation recipe to efficiently compute entanglement monotones involving antilinear operations , developing the eqs concepts for an ion - trap based quantum computer . the associated quantum algorithm is composed of two steps .",
    "first , we embed the @xmath0-qubit quantum dynamics of interest into a larger hilbert space involving only one additional ion qubit and stroboscopic techniques .",
    "second , we extract the corresponding entanglement monotones with a protocol requiring only the measurement of the additional single qubit . it is noteworthy to mention that , for the computation of the associated entanglement monotones , the eqs approach does not require full - state tomography . finally , we show how to correct experimental imperfections induced by our quantum algorithm .",
    "entanglement monotones are functionals of the quantum state of a system taking zero value when the state is separable , and do not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . for pure states , a class of entanglement monotones can be defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is some hermitian operator , and @xmath3 is the complex - conjugation operation  @xcite ; see , for example , the case of the two - qubit concurrence  @xcite where @xmath4 . as a consequence , @xmath5",
    "does not correspond to the the expectation value of a physical observable , thus it can not be directly measured .",
    "let us assume that we have an @xmath0-qubit system , represented by the wavefunction @xmath6 , evolving under a hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "as described above , this system will be embedded in a larger one , requiring only one additional qubit , in such a way that @xmath3 becomes a physical operation  @xcite .",
    "the embedding procedure is based on the following mapping @xmath8 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the wavefunction and hamiltonian ( with @xmath11 and @xmath12 its real and imaginary parts ) governing the dynamics of the @xmath0-qubit system in the simulated space , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to their images in the enlarged hilbert space , these having a dimension of @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath17 , projects the states of the embedding quantum simulator onto the simulated space through the identity @xmath18 .",
    "for example , for a single - qubit case where @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the transpose operation , the corresponding enlarged - wavefunction is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and the @xmath26 matrix is @xmath27 .",
    "note that due to the property @xmath28 , the previous relation is valid at any time @xmath29 as long as the embedding quantum simulator is initialized such that @xmath30 .",
    "although this mapping from @xmath31 to @xmath32 is nonphysical , the initial state @xmath32 can be directly generated from the ground state of the simulator . in the embedding quantum simulator",
    ", the physical quantum gate @xmath33 applied to @xmath13 produces a quantum state corresponding to @xmath34 in the simulated space , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "this will allow us to efficiently compute correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath34 in terms of standard expectation values in the enlarged space as follows @xmath36 with @xmath2 being a hermitian operator .",
    "in this way , the expectation value of the antilinear operator @xmath37 in the simulated space can be evaluated via the measurement of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the enlarged hilbert space .",
    "trapped - ion systems are among the most promising technologies for quantum computation and quantum simulation protocols  @xcite . in such systems , fidelities of state preparation , two - qubit gate generation , and qubit detection ,",
    "exceed values of @xmath40  @xcite . with current technology , more",
    "than @xmath41 quantum gates including many body interactions have been performed  @xcite . in this sense , the technology of trapped ions becomes a promising quantum platform to host the described embedded quantum algorithm . in the following analysis",
    ", we will rely only on a set of operations involving local rotations and global entangling mlmer - srensen ( ms ) gates  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our method is not only applicable to trapped - ion systems . in general",
    ", it can be used in any platform where ms gates , or other long - range entangling interactions , as well as local rotations and qubit decoupling are available . among such systems , we can mention cqed  @xcite where an implementation of ms gates has been recently proposed  @xcite , or quantum photonics where ms interactions are available after a decomposition in controlled not gates  @xcite .",
    "the embedded dynamics of an interacting - qubit system is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath42 , where the hamiltonian @xmath14 is @xmath43 and each @xmath44 operator corresponds to a tensorial product of pauli matrices . in this way , an embedded @xmath0-qubit dynamics can be implemented in two steps .",
    "first , we decompose the evolution operator using standard trotter techniques  @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of trotter steps .",
    "second , each exponential @xmath47 can be implemented with a sequence of two mlmer - srensen gates  @xcite and a single qubit rotation between them  @xcite .",
    "these three quantum gates generate the evolution operator @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the coupling constant of the single qubit rotation  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , subsequent local rotations will produce any combination of pauli matrices .    as it is the case of quantum models involving pauli operators ,",
    "there exist different representations of the same dynamics .",
    "for example , the physically equivalent ising hamiltonians , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are mapped onto the enlarged space as @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in principle , both hamiltonians @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be implemented in trapped ions . however , while @xmath55 requires two- and three - body interactions , @xmath56 is implementable with a collective rotation applied to the ions @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the implementation of the free - energy terms , and ms gates for the interaction term . in this sense , @xmath59 requires less experimental resources for the implementation of the eqs dynamics .",
    "therefore , a suitable choice of the system representation can considerably enhance the performance of the simulator .",
    "we want to measure correlations of the form appearing in eq .",
    "( [ anti ] ) , with @xmath2 a linear combination of tensorial products of pauli matrices and identity operators .",
    "this information can be encoded in the expectation value @xmath60 of one of the ions in the chain after performing two evolutions of the form of eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) .",
    "let us consider the operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 and choose the pauli matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 commute and both anticommute with the pauli operator to be measured @xmath67 . in this manner , we have that @xmath68",
    "then , a suitable choice of pauli matrices will produce the desired correlation .",
    "note that this protocol always results in a correlation of an odd number of pauli matrices . in order to access a correlation of an even number of qubits",
    ", we have to measure a two - qubit correlation @xmath69 instead of just @xmath70 . for the particular case of correlations of only pauli matrices and no identity operators ,",
    "evolution @xmath66 is not needed and no distinction between odd and even correlations has to be done .",
    "for instance , if one is interested in an even correlation like @xmath71 , @xmath0 being the number of ions of the system , then one would have to measure observable @xmath72 after the evolutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "however , for the particular case of @xmath75 a single evolution @xmath76 and subsequent measurement of @xmath77 is enough .",
    "note that all the gates in the protocol , as they are of the type of eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , are implementable with single qubit and ms gates .",
    "consider the ising hamiltonian for two spins , @xmath78 whose image in the enlarged space corresponds to @xmath79 .",
    "the evolution operator associated to this hamiltonian can be implemented using the trotter method from eq .",
    "( [ trotterexpansion ] ) with @xmath80 . while evolutions @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be implemented with single ion rotations , the evolution @xmath83 , which is of the kind described in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , is implemented with two ms gates and a single ion rotation .",
    "this simple case allows us to compute directly quantities such as the concurrence measuring @xmath84 and @xmath85 . according to the measurement method introduced above",
    ", to access these correlations we first evolve the system under the gate @xmath86 for a time such that @xmath87 , and then measure @xmath88 for the first correlation and @xmath89 for the second one .",
    "based on the two - qubit example , one can think of implementing a three - qubit model as @xmath90 , which in the enlarged space corresponds to @xmath91 this evolution results in ghz kind states , which can be readily detected using the 3-tangle @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "this is an entanglement monotone of the general class of eq .",
    "( [ anti ] ) that can be computed in the enlarged space by measuring @xmath93 .",
    "more complex hamiltonians with interactions involving only three of the four particles can also be implemented . in this case",
    ", the required entangling operations acting only on a part of the entire register can be realized with the aid of splitting the ms operations into smaller parts and inserting refocusing pulses between them as shown in ref .",
    "an alternative method is to decouple the spectator ions from the laser light by shelving the quantum information into additional zeeman substates of the ions as sketched in fig .",
    "( [ figures levelscheme ] ) for @xmath94ca@xmath95 ions .",
    "this procedure has been successfully demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for systems composed of a larger number of qubits , for example @xmath96 , our method yields nontrivial results given that the standard computation of entanglement monotones of the kind @xmath97 requires the measurement of a number of observables that grows exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath98  @xcite our method requires the evaluation of @xmath58 observables while the standard procedure based on state tomography requires , in general , the measurement of @xmath99 observables .",
    "a crucial issue of a quantum simulation algorithm is its susceptibility to experimental imperfections . in order to investigate the deviations with respect to the ideal case ,",
    "the system dynamics needs to be described by completely positive maps instead of unitary dynamics .",
    "such a map is defined by the process matrix @xmath100 acting on a density operator @xmath101 as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the pauli matrices spanning a basis of the operator space . in complex algorithms",
    ", errors can be modeled by adding a depolarizing process with a probability @xmath104 to the ideal process @xmath105 @xmath106 in order to perform a numerical simulation including this error model , it is required to decompose the quantum simulation into an implementable gate sequence .",
    "numerical simulations of the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "[ figures simulation ] a ) , b ) , and c ) .",
    "naturally , this analysis is only valid if the noise in the real system is close to depolarizing noise .",
    "however , recent analysis of entangling operations indicates that this noise model is accurate  @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ depnoisemodel ] ) , after @xmath46 gate operations , we show that @xmath109 where @xmath110 corresponds to the ideal expectation value in the absence of decoherence , and @xmath111 is the observable measured in the experiment .",
    "given that we are working with observables composed of tensorial products of pauli operators @xmath112 with @xmath113 , eq .  ( [ idealexpectation ] ) will simplify to @xmath114 . in order to retrieve with uncertainty @xmath115 the expected value of an operator @xmath116 , the experiment will need to be repeated @xmath117 times . here",
    ", we have used @xmath118 ( for large @xmath0 ) , and that the relation between the standard deviations of the ideal and experimental expectation values is @xmath119 .",
    "if we compare @xmath120 with the required number of repetitions to measure the same entanglement monotone to the same accuracy @xmath115 in a one - to - one quantum simulator , @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 here , @xmath123 is the number of observables corresponding to a given entanglement monotone in the enlarged space , and @xmath124 is the gate fidelity in the one - to - one approach .",
    "we are also asuming that full state tomography of @xmath125 qubits requires @xmath126 measurement settings for experiments exploiting single - qubit discrimination during the measurement process  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we assume the one - to - one quantum simulator to work under the same error model but with @xmath124 fidelity per gate .",
    "finally , we expect that the number of gates grows linearly with the number of qubits , that is @xmath127 , which is a fair assumption for a nearest - neighbor interaction model . in general",
    ", we can assume that @xmath124 is always bigger than @xmath128 as the embedding quantum simulator requires an additional qubit which naturally could increase the gate error rate .",
    "however , for realistic values of @xmath128 and @xmath124 , e.g. @xmath129 and @xmath130 one can prove that @xmath131 .",
    "this condition is always fulfilled for large systems if @xmath132 .",
    "the latter is a reasonable assumption given that in any quantum platform it is expected @xmath133 when the number of qubits grows , i.e. we expect the same gate fidelity for @xmath0 and @xmath134 qubit systems when @xmath0 is large .",
    "note that this analysis assumes that the same amount of trotter steps is required for the embedded and the one - to - one simulator .",
    "this is a realistic assumption if one considers the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) .",
    "a second type of imperfections are undesired unitary operations due to imperfect calibration of the applied gates or due to crosstalk between neighboring qubits .",
    "this crosstalk occurs when performing operations on a single ion due to imperfect single site illumination  @xcite .",
    "thus the operation @xmath135 needs to be written as @xmath136 where the crosstalk is characterized by the matrix @xmath137 . for this analysis",
    ", we assume that the crosstalk affects only the nearest neighbors with strength @xmath138 leading to a matrix @xmath139 . in fig .",
    "[ figures simulation ] d ) simulations including crosstalk are shown .",
    "it can be seen , that simulations with increasing crosstalk show qualitatively different behavior of the 3-tangle , as in the simulation for @xmath140 ( yellow line ) where the entire dynamics is distorted .",
    "this effect was not observed in the simulations including depolarizing noise and , therefore , we identify unitary crosstalk as a critical error in the embedding quantum simulator .",
    "it should be noted that , if accurately characterized , the described crosstalk can be completely compensated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed an embedded quantum algorithm for trapped - ion systems to efficiently compute entanglement monotones for @xmath0 interacting qubits at any time of their evolution and without the need for full state tomography .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that the performance of eqs would outperform similar efforts with one - to - one quantum simulators , where the case of 10 qubit may be considered already as intractable .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the involved decoherence effects can be corrected if they are well characterized .",
    "we believe that eqs methods will prove useful as long as the hilbert - space dimensions of quantum simulators grows in complexity in different quantum platforms .",
