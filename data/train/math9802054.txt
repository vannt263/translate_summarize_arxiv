    "the moduli space of flat @xmath0-bundles on a riemann surface is the classical phase space for the chern - simons gauge theory and , thus , it is in a sense the classical limit of the wznw conformal field theory .",
    "this means that quantizing it one can get a space of quantum states which turns out to be isomorphic to the space of conformal blocks of the corresponding wznw theory .",
    "this statement has been checked by several authors ( cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) with help of different quantization methods . on the other hand , the moduli spaces of flat bundles as well as closely related to them moduli spaces of holomorphic bundles ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) attracted much attention from a purely mathematical point of view ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in section [ ps ]",
    "we discuss in detail the canonical poisson structure on the moduli space of flat bundles on riemann surfaces with holes ( i.e. with boundary ) . in section [ fdm ]",
    "we construct a poisson structure on the space of graph connections in such a way that the action of the graph gauge group is poissonian with respect to an appropriate nontrivial poisson - lie structure .",
    "the considerations of this section are inspired mainly by constructions of refs .",
    "@xcite where a discrete analogue of current algebra was suggested and investigated .",
    "then we prove that the quotient of the space of graph connections by the gauge group coincides with the moduli space of flat connections on a riemann surface determined by the graph .",
    "one of the main aims of our preprint @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) was to give a description of the moduli space of flat connections in the form ready for quantisation .",
    "we are not going to discuss this problem here for since that time some progress towards this direction was made , see refs .",
    "@xcite . the interested reader can find details and discussions in those papers .",
    "note only that the result of quantisation is a noncommutative algebra having wznw model conformal blocks as its representation space and being functorial with respect to the imbeddings of surfaces .",
    "for the readers interested in a more understandable and detailed presentation we would like to recommend a very good review by m.audin @xcite .",
    "the moduli space of flat connections on a compact riemann surface is by definition a subquotient of a topologically trivial space of all connections .",
    "this description is useful also since a nontrivial poisson manifold ( which is the moduli space , or an orbifold , to be more precise ) is represented as a result of a reduction of a trivial symplectic manifold ( see sect .",
    "[ ps ] for details ) .",
    "unlike the former , the latter has plenty of convenient parameterizations .",
    "the only disadvantage of this description is that the space of connections is infinite dimensional . in this paper ( sect .",
    "[ fdm ] ) we consider an alternative description of the moduli space in which the role of the space of all connections on a riemann surface is played by a finite dimensional manifold .",
    "the idea is quite familiar both from lattice gauge theory and from ech cohomology .",
    "namely , consider a triangulation of a compact riemann surface @xmath1 ( with boundary , in general ) .",
    "then we get a graph formed by the vertices and the edges of this triangulation . by a graph connection ( or lattice gauge field )",
    "we mean an assignment of a group element of the gauge group @xmath0 to each ( oriented ) edge .",
    "the group of lattice gauge transformations @xmath2 acting on the space of graph connections in a natural way is simply a product of several copies of @xmath0 , one copy for each vertex of the graph .",
    "a flat graph connection satisfies the condition that the monodromies around all the faces of the triangulation are equal to @xmath3 .",
    "( the monodromy is the product of group elements corresponding to the consecutive edges of a face , whatever shape of faces is used .",
    "one has to take account only of the orientations of the edges in an obvious way . )",
    "now , it is a standard assertion that the moduli space of ( smooth ) flat connections on @xmath1 is isomorphic to the space of flat graph connections modulo graph gauge transformations .",
    "( this is in fact nothing but the statement in ech cohomology that this space is represented by @xmath4 . )",
    "dealing with a surface with holes amounts to saying that some faces of the triangulation are left empty and one does not have to require anything about the corresponding monodromies .",
    "it is important to note that if a graph @xmath5 is obtained from a triangulation of a surface @xmath1 it can be endowed with an additional structure which ( together with the graph itself ) contains all the information about the topology of the surface .",
    "we suppose that @xmath1 is oriented .",
    "the orientation of @xmath1 induces a cyclic order of the ends of edges incident to each vertex .",
    "a graph @xmath5 with a given cyclic order at each vertex is called a fat graph .",
    "if @xmath1 has at least one hole the most economical way is to consider a fat graph with all the faces empty , what is always possible .",
    "conversely , given a fat graph @xmath5 the corresponding surface can be restored by replacing edges of @xmath5 by strips glued together at vertices respecting the cyclic order ( cf . ) .",
    "summarizing , in order to describe the moduli space @xmath6 of flat connections on a surface @xmath1 with holes we choose a fat graph corresponding to @xmath1 ( this choice is not unique ) and consider the quotient of the space of graph connections @xmath7 by the action of graph gauge transformations , @xmath8 .    having described the moduli space as a manifold we are interested now in describing its poisson structure .",
    "let us forget for a moment that we can define a poisson structure on @xmath6 by reduction of the space of all ( smooth ) connections on @xmath1 and try instead to define a poisson structure on @xmath7 in such a way that it can be pulled down on @xmath6   we obtain in this way the same poisson structure as defined by the reduction procedure from smooth connections . ] .",
    "we would like to have such a poisson structure on @xmath7 that the projection @xmath9 will be a poisson map .",
    "this can be achieved if @xmath2 will act on @xmath7 in a poisson way ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the definition of poisson group actions on poisson manifolds ) . for this aim",
    "we have to define first a poisson - lie structure on @xmath2 itself .",
    "the group of graph gauge transformations @xmath2 is the direct product of several copies of @xmath0 , with one copy per each vertex of @xmath5 .",
    "let us define the poisson structure on @xmath2 as a direct product of poisson structures on each copy of @xmath0 in @xmath2 .",
    "the latter can be defined independently at each vertex .",
    "( to define a poisson structure on @xmath0 one has to choose a classical @xmath10-matrix . )",
    "now we look for a poisson structure on @xmath7 . the requirement that the action of @xmath2 is a poisson one is almost sufficient to determine the poisson structure on @xmath11 .",
    "the ambiguity amounts in fact to choosing a linear order of ends of edges at each vertex .",
    "therefore , instead of fat graphs we have to deal with graphs with linear order .",
    "let us call such graphs _ ciliated fat graphs_. a ciliated fat graph can be considered as a fat graph with an additional structure ( the fat graph underlying a given ciliated fat one is restored uniquely ) .",
    "this additional structure ( linear order at each vertex ) can be represented by picturing the underlying fat graph on a sheet of paper in such a way that the cyclic order is everywhere , say , counterclockwise and by placing at each vertex a small cilium separating the minimal and the maximal end incident to that vertex .",
    "as it was mentioned , a fat graph defines a surface , that is an oriented surface with holes ; a ciliated fat graph , similarly , defines a ciliated surface , that is an oriented surface with holes and with some points marked on the boundary ( ) .",
    "thus for every ciliated fat graph we have an associated poisson manifold , namely the space of graph connection endowed with an @xmath10-matrix poisson structure .",
    "it may happen of course that two different ciliated graphs give isomorphic poisson manifolds of graph connections .",
    "in particular , one can show that the isomorphism class of the arising poisson manifold depends only on the diffeomorphism class of the corresponding ciliated surface",
    ".    it may be worth mentioning some distinguished examples of graphs and corresponding poisson manifolds .",
    "the poisson manifold corresponding to the graph consisting only of two vertices and one edge ( ) coincides with the poisson - lie group @xmath0 provided the @xmath10-matrices chosen at the vertices are related by the operation of permutation of tensor factors ( @xmath12 ) . with the same condition on @xmath10-matrices , the graph consisting of two vertices and two edges connecting them ( ) yields the manifold @xmath13 endowed with a poisson - lie structure coinciding with that of the double @xmath14 .",
    "if we take the same @xmath10-matrices at two vertices we get @xmath15 as our poisson manifold ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the definitions of doubles ) . finally , the graph consisting of one vertex and one edge ( ) corresponds to the poisson manifold @xmath16 , the dual poisson - lie group .",
    "the following operations with graphs are important to discuss : @xmath17 ) erasing an edge ( ) , @xmath18 ) contracting an edge ( ) , @xmath19 ) gluing graph(s ) ( ) , and @xmath20 ) adding a loop ( see sect .",
    "[ fdm ] ) .",
    "the linear orders at the vertices touched by such an operation descend from those of the original graph in a more or less obvious way ( cf . ) .",
    "we have to mention only that there are in fact two ways to contract an edge which differ in what happens to the cilia .",
    "the operation of gluing deserves some explanation .",
    "given two vertices on a graph with the same number @xmath21 of ends of edges incident to them we can form a new graph by erasing both vertices and gluing together thus liberated edges .",
    "( the @xmath22-th end liberated at one vertex is to be glued to the @xmath23-th end at the other vertex . )",
    "note that with help of this operation one can glue together two different graphs obtaining a single new one",
    ".    for the operations on graphs just described there exist natural maps between the corresponding spaces of graph connections .",
    "these maps are in fact projections in directions shown by the arrows in .",
    "a pleasant feature is that these maps turn out to be poisson maps .",
    "more precisely , in case of gluing one has to require that the @xmath10-matrices at two vertices to be glued are related by permutation of tensor factors .",
    "consider , for instance , a map corresponding to gluing together two simplest graphs ( ) each of which represents the poisson - lie group @xmath0 ( an edge with two vertices ) .",
    "the result of gluing is again a graph of the same shape while the corresponding map of graph connections , @xmath24 , is simply the group product which is known to be a poisson map .",
    "similarly , gluing together the graphs representing @xmath25 gives the poisson map @xmath26 ( ) corresponding to the group multiplication .",
    "contracting one of two edges of the @xmath25 graph ( ) one obtains the poisson map @xmath27 . as a poisson manifold",
    ", the dual group @xmath16 can be identified with the coset @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the diagonal subgroup in @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "the isomorphism of @xmath16 with the coset @xmath28 shows that there is a poisson action of @xmath25 on @xmath16 , i.e. a poisson map @xmath31 which again can be described by gluing graphs ( as shown in ) .",
    "looking at the pictures above suggests the following generalisation of the notion of a double .",
    "namely , we can define a poisson - lie group , called in general a _ polyuble _",
    ", by the ciliated fat graph consisting of two vertices and several edges connecting them ( analogously to the case of the double , the @xmath10-matrices at two vertices should be related by the operation of permutation of tensor factors , while the order of ends should be opposite ; ) .",
    "an immediate observation is that on the space of graph connections @xmath7 for an arbitrary ciliated fat graph @xmath5 there is a poisson action of a polyuble , @xmath32 , adjusted to each vertex , where @xmath33 is the number of legs at that vertex ( see , ) .",
    "thus the space @xmath7 is a homogeneous space for the group @xmath34 which is a direct product ( in the sense of poisson groups ) of @xmath32 s .",
    "note also that the group of graph gauge transformations @xmath2 which gives us the moduli space @xmath35 is a poisson subgroup in @xmath34 .",
    "( any individual polyuble , disregarding for the moment the poisson structure , is a product @xmath36 and contains the diagonal subgroup which turns out to be a poisson subgroup . )    finally , it is worth mentioning that some particular cases of poisson manifolds defined by graphs have been considered in literature .",
    "namely the poisson manifold of graph connections on a graph corresponding to the boundary of a polygon was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as a discrete approximation of current algebra coadjoint space .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite where this discrete approximation was used to investigate wznw conformal model . )",
    "in this section we shall describe a poisson structure on the space of flat connections modulo gauge transformations on riemann surfaces with holes by means of a reduction of the space of all smooth connections on them .",
    "let @xmath1 be an oriented compact riemann surface with holes .",
    "let @xmath37 be the space of smooth @xmath0-connections on it , where @xmath0 is a reductive complex lie group with the lie algebra @xmath38 with a chosen nondegenerate invariant quadratic form which we denote by @xmath39 .",

    "the quotient space , @xmath68 is a finite dimensional poisson manifold .",
    "its symplectic leaves are in one - to - one correspondence with the coadjoint orbits of the centrally extended group of gauge transformations which in turn are parameterized by the conjugacy classes of monodromies around the holes .",

    "we show here that one can interpret the phase space of the trigonometric ruijsenaars system as a symplectic leaf of the lowest dimension in the moduli space @xmath6 of flat @xmath185 connections on a once holed torus .",
    "the commuting hamiltonians described in @xcite are certain conjugation invariant functions of one of monodromies , the monodromy around one of the cycles of the torus , while the coordinates are the eigenvalues of the other .",

    "algorithmically , it is of course just the same as it was proposed by s.n.m.ruijsenaars and h.shneider @xcite ; we just give a natural geometric meaning to it .",
    "to describe the symplectic structure on @xmath6 , choose the ciliated fat graph @xmath5 consisting of two edges and one vertex with the ciliated fat graph structure as shown in corresponding to the once holed torus ( ) .",
    "the space of graph connections , @xmath7 , for such a graph is just a product of two copies of the group @xmath0 , @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are assigned to the edges of the graph as indicated in .",

    "it is not practical , however , to compute the poisson brackets between @xmath246 and @xmath247 using this bivector as it is , because it does not agree with the diagonal form of the matrix @xmath196 . in order to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "since we are interested only in computing poisson brackets of gauge invariant functions , we may change the bivector ( a[poiss ] ) in such a way that it still defines the same poisson bracket on the space of gauge invariant functions .",
