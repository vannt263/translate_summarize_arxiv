    "@xmath11 is the interaction of each particle with a uniform neutralizing background , corresponding to an ocp or jellium with an attractive trap at the origin .",
    "an example that has been studied recently is jellium with a point positive ion of charge number @xmath12 at the origin @xcite . at equilibrium the electron density",
    "is enhanced ( partial confinement ) near the origin and approaches a uniform limit far from the ion , for sufficiently large @xmath1 , due to charge neutrality .",
    "an opposite extreme is a system of charges in a strong trap such that they are localized in a finite domain away from the wall and their density vanishes outside this domain ( complete confinement ) .",
    "there is a continuous mapping between these two limiting cases , controlled by the relative strengths of the repulsion between particles and the strength and form of the confining potential .",
    "the discussion of these cases here will be limited to classical statistical mechanics .",
    "in the absence of a confining potential the equilibrium density may be uniform ( charge neutral ) or nonuniform ( charged ) . in general the confining potential will induce a nonuniform equilibrium density in any case .",

    "we report on some preliminary results for the qualitatively different case of weakly coupled charges @xmath19 in a harmonic trap @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "there is then a competition between coulomb repulsion and attraction by the central trap , with charge density enhanced near the wall or near the center , respectively .",

    "preliminary studies of the harmonic trap suggest the possibility of a simplification in that case as well .",
    "as noted above , the low temperature limit leads to a uniform density inside a sphere of radius @xmath60 . since the effective potential @xmath61 for the dynamics",
