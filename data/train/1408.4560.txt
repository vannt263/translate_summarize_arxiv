    "for example , we will show that @xmath41 the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 in are finite and positive , as is @xmath44 provided @xmath45 , and these quantities are in fact variances associated with convex hulls of brownian scaling limits for the walk .",
    "these scaling limits provide the basis of the analysis in this paper ; the methods are necessarily quite different from those in @xcite .",

    "for the constants @xmath47 ( @xmath48 being the identity matrix ) , @xmath49 , and @xmath43 , table [ table2 ] gives numerical evaluations of rigorous bounds that we prove in proposition [ prop : var_bounds ] below , plus estimates from simulations .",

    "we describe our scaling limit approach , and carry it through after presenting the necessary preliminaries ; the main results of this section , theorems [ thm : limit - zero ] and [ thm : limit - drift ] , give weak convergence statements for convex hulls of random walks in the case of zero and non - zero drift , respectively .",
    "armed with these weak convergence results , we present asymptotics for expectations and variances of the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 in section [ sec : asymptotics ] ; the arguments in this section rely in part on the scaling limit apparatus , and in part on direct random walk computations .",

    "a candidate scaling limit for the walk is readily identified in terms of planar brownian motion . for the case",
    "@xmath26 , the ` usual ' approach of centering and then scaling the walk ( to again obtain planar brownian motion ) is not useful in our context , as this transformation does not act on the convex hull in any sensible way .",
    "a better idea is to scale space differently in the direction of @xmath16 and in the orthogonal direction .    in other words ,",
    "in either case we consider @xmath57 for some _ affine _ continuous scaling function @xmath58 .",
    "the convex hull is preserved under affine transformations , so @xmath59 the convex hull of a random set which will have a weak limit .",
    "we will then be able to deduce scaling limits for quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 provided , first , that we work in suitable spaces on which our functionals of interest enjoy continuity , so that we can appeal to the continuous mapping theorem for weak limits , and , second , that @xmath60 acts on length and area by simple scaling .",
    "the usual @xmath61 scaling when @xmath40 is fine ; for @xmath26 we scale space in one coordinate by @xmath62 and in the other by @xmath61 , which acts nicely on area , but _ not _ length .",
    "thus these methods work exactly in the three cases corresponding to .    in view of the scaling",
