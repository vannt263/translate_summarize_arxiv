    "thin films of abo@xmath0 perovskite ferroelectrics play an important role in numerous microelectronic , catalytic , and other high - technology applications , and are frequently used as substrates for growth of other materials such as cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that a large number of _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical calculations @xcite , as well as several classical shell - model ( sm ) studies @xcite , have dealt with the atomic and electronic structure of the ( 001 ) surface of batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 , and srtio@xmath0 crystals . in order to study the dependence of the surface relaxation properties on the exchange - correlation functionals and the type of basis ( localized vs.  plane - wave ) used in the calculations , a detailed comparative study of srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surfaces based on ten different quantum - mechanical techniques @xcite was recently performed .    due to intensive development and progressive miniaturization of electronic devices , the surface structure as well as the electronic properties of the abo@xmath0 perovskite thin films have been extensively studied experimentally during the last years .",
    "the srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface structure has been analyzed by means of low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) @xcite , reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) @xcite , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , ultraviolet electron spectroscopy ( ups ) , medium - energy ion scattering ( meis ) @xcite , and surface x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is important to note that the leed @xcite and rheed @xcite experiments contradict each other in the sign ( contraction or expansion ) of the interplanar distance between top metal atom and the second crystal layer for the sro - terminated srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the most recent experimental studies on the srtio@xmath0 surfaces include a combination of xps , leed , and time - of - flight scattering and recoil spectrometry ( tof - sars ) @xcite , as well as metastable impact electron spectroscopy ( mies ) @xcite . in these recent studies ,",
    "well - resolved 1@xmath21 leed patterns were obtained for the tio@xmath1-terminated srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface .",
    "simulations of the tof - sars azimuthal scans indicate that the o atoms are situated 0.1  above the ti layer ( surface plane ) in the case of the tio@xmath1-terminated srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface .",
    "while the ( 001 ) surfaces of srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 have been extensively studied , much less is known about the ( 011 ) surfaces .",
    "the scarcity of information about these surfaces is likely due to the polar character of the ( 011 ) orientation .",
    "( 011 ) terminations of srtio@xmath0 have frequently been observed , but efforts towards the precise characterization of their atomic - scale structure and corresponding electronic properties has only begun in the last decade , specifically using atomic - force microscopy @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , auger spectroscopy , and low - energy electron - diffraction ( leed ) @xcite methods .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "very few _ ab initio _ studies of perovskite ( 011 ) surfaces exist .",
    "the first _ ab initio _ study of the electronic and atomic structures of several ( 1@xmath21 ) terminations of the ( 011 ) polar orientation of the srtio@xmath0 surface was performed by bottin _",
    "@xcite one year later heifets _",
    "@xcite performed very comprehensive _ ab initio _ hartree - fock calculations for four possible terminations ( tio , sr , and two kinds of o terminations ) of the srtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surface .",
    "recently heifets _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed _ ab initio _ density - functional calculations of the atomic structure and charge redistribution for different terminations of the bazro@xmath0 ( 011 ) surfaces . however , despite the high technological potential of batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 , we are unaware of any previous _ ab initio _ calculations performed for the batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surfaces . in this study",
    ", therefore , we have investigated the ( 011 ) as well as the ( 001 ) surfaces of batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 , with an emphasis on the effect of the surface relaxation and rumpling , surface energies , and the charge redistributions and changes in bond strength that occur at the surface .",
    "we carry out first - principles calculations in the framework of density - functional theory ( dft ) using the crystal computer code @xcite . unlike the plane - wave codes employed in many previous studies @xcite , crystal uses localized gaussian - type basis sets . in our calculations",
    ", we adopted the basis sets developed for batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 in ref .",
    "our calculations were performed using the hybrid exchange - correlation b3pw functional involving a mixture of non - local fock exact exchange , lda exchange , and becke s gradient corrected exchange functional @xcite , combined with the non - local gradient corrected correlation potential of perdew and wang @xcite .",
    "we chose the hybrid b3pw functional for our current study because it yields excellent results for the srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , and pbtio@xmath0 bulk lattice constant and bulk modulus @xcite .",
    "the reciprocal - space integration was performed by sampling the brillouin zone with an 8@xmath28@xmath28 pack - monkhorst mesh @xcite , which provides a balanced summation in direct and reciprocal spaces . to achieve high accuracy ,",
    "large enough tolerances of 7 , 8 , 7 , 7 , and 14 were chosen for the dimensionless coulomb overlap , coulomb penetration , exchange overlap , first exchange pseudo - overlap , and second exchange pseudo - overlap parameters , respectively @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the crystal code is that it treats isolated 2d slabs , without any artificial periodicity in the @xmath3 direction perpendicular to the surface , as commonly employed in most previous surface band - structure calculations ( e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] ) . in the present _ ab initio _ investigation",

    "one of these slabs was terminated by bao planes for the batio@xmath0 crystal ( or pbo planes for pbtio@xmath0 ) and consisted of a supercell containing 17 atoms .",
    "the second slab was terminated by tio@xmath1 planes for both materials and consisted of a supercell containing 18 atoms .",
    "these slabs are non - stoichiometric , with unit cell formulae ba@xmath8ti@xmath0o@xmath9 or pb@xmath8ti@xmath0o@xmath9 , and ba@xmath0ti@xmath8o@xmath10 or pb@xmath0ti@xmath8o@xmath10 for batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 perovskites , respectively .",
    "these two ( bao or pbo and tio@xmath1 ) terminations are the only two possible flat and dense ( 001 ) surfaces for the batio@xmath0 or pbtio@xmath0 perovskite lattice structure .",
    "the sequence of layers at the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface of batio@xmath0 is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "unlike the ( 001 ) cleavage of batio@xmath0 or pbtio@xmath0 , which naturally gives rise to non - polar bao ( or pbo ) and tio@xmath1 terminations , a naive cleavage of batio@xmath0 or pbtio@xmath0 to create ( 011 ) surfaces leads to the formation of polar surfaces .",
    "for example , the stacking of the batio@xmath0 crystal along the ( 011 ) direction consists of alternating planes of o@xmath1 and batio units having nominal charges of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , assuming o@xmath13 , ti@xmath14 , and ba@xmath15 constituents .",
    "( henceforth we shall use batio@xmath0 for presentation purposes , but everything that is said will apply equally to the pbtio@xmath0 case . ) thus , a simple cleavage leads to o@xmath1-terminated and batio - terminated ( 011 ) surfaces that are _ polar _ and have nominal surface charges of @xmath16 and @xmath17 per surface cell respectively .",
    "these are shown as the top and bottom surfaces in fig .",
    "2(a ) respectively .",
    "if uncompensated , the surface charge would lead to an infinite electrostatic cleavage energy . in reality , the polar surfaces would probably become metallic in order to remain neutral , but in view of the large electronic gaps in the perovskites , such metallic surfaces would presumably be unfavorable .",
    "thus , we may expect rather generally that such polar crystal terminations are relatively unstable in this class of materials @xcite .",

    "( d ) 7-layer slab with ba - terminated surfaces.,width=288 ]    on the other hand , if the cleavage occurs in such a way as to leave a half layer of o@xmath1 units on each surface , we obtain the non - polar surface structure shown in fig .",
    "every other surface o atom has been removed , and the remaining o atoms occupy the same sites as in the bulk structure",
    ". we shall refer to this as the `` o - terminated '' ( 011 ) surface , in distinction to the `` o@xmath1-terminated '' polar surface already discussed in fig .",
    "the non - polar nature of the o - terminated surface can be confirmed by noting that the 7-layer 15-atom ba@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath18 slab shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , which has two o - terminated surfaces , is neutral .",
    "it is also possible to make non - polar tio - terminated and ba - terminated surfaces , as shown in figs .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "this is accomplished by splitting a batio layer during cleavage , instead of splitting an o@xmath1 layer . for the tio and ba - terminated surfaces",
    ", we use 7-layer slabs having composition ba@xmath1ti@xmath8o@xmath9 ( 16 atoms ) and ba@xmath8ti@xmath1o@xmath19 ( 14 atoms ) as shown in fig .",

    "our calculated surface energies show that the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface is slightly more stable for both materials than the bao or pbo - terminated ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the o - terminated batio@xmath0 and tio - terminated pbtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surfaces have surface energies close to that of the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "our calculations suggest that the most unfavorable ( 011 ) surfaces are the ba or pb - terminated ones for both the batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 cases .",
    "we found that relaxation of the batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 surfaces for is considerably stronger for all three ( 011 ) terminations than for the ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "the atomic displacements in the third plane from the surface for the three terminations of batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surfaces are still large .",
    "finally , our _ ab initio _ calculations indicate a considerable increase of ti - o bond covalency near the batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surface relative to batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 bulk , much larger than for the ( 001 ) surface .",
