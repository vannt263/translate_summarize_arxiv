    "single photon detectors ( spd ) represent the ultimate sensitivity limit for quantum photodetectors , and many quantum optics and quantum information applications are based on its existence @xcite . nowadays",
    ", there are several available types of spd s sensitive to different light wavelengths and with a varying range of quantum efficiencies qd , apd1,verevkin , kitay , sspd , apd2,photo , tes , vlpc , kor , karve . among many applications ,",
    "spd s are the main ingredient in the situations where one measures the electromagnetic field ( em ) with few photons enclosed in a cavity , the photons being counted one by one .",
    "theoretical treatment of such a scheme , known as _ continuous photodetection model _ ( cpm ) , was proposed by srinivas and davies ( sd ) in 1981 @xcite and did find many applications since then @xcite .    in sd scheme , in each infinitesimal time interval",
    "the photodetector has only two possible outcomes : either a single photon is detected ( ` click ' of the detector ) , or it is not . in both cases the state of the field changes as time goes on : for a click , the field loses one photon and suffers a _ quantum jump _ ; for no - click the field state modifies continuously and non - unitarily due to the monitoring of the detector @xcite .",
    "thus , besides allowing determination of the statistical properties of the em field through photocounts statistics , the detector also exerts a back - action on the field by which the outcome of the measurement modifies the cavity field state @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was widely used for different theoretical proposals , e.g. for changing the field statistics from sub - poissonian to super - poissonian @xcite , for controlling the entanglement between two field modes @xcite or inducing spin squeezing in a cavity @xcite .",
    "however , no experimental verification of the cpm has been made until now , though nowadays it is quite realistic to make simple photocounting experiments for testing the theory , provided one takes into account inevitable losses present in the experiment and include them into the model @xcite .    here",
    "we study how the field state after the click depends on detector s parameters .",
    "it is worth considering how spd s actually operate : despite technical and structural differences associated with every kind of detector , the photodetection process is based on the same principle : the ` sensor ' initially set in a ` ground state ' interacts with the field and is likely to absorb a photon , doing a transition to the ` excited state ' . after some time the sensor decays back to the ground state , emitting a photoelectron that triggers the ` amplification mechanism ' ( am ) of the spd ( e.g. , by an avalanche process ) , producing a pulse of macroscopic electric current or voltage , that originates a registered click of the detector , representing one count .",
    "besides , in real photodetectors there is a phenomenon called _ dark counts _ : photoelectrons originated due to the intrinsic excitations inside the am , and not due to the absorption of one photon from the field .",
    "the influence of dark counts on the results of various experiments was considered in @xcite , and different schemes of calculating dark count probability and single - photon quantum efficiency were used in @xcite .    in the cpm ,",
    "all the results concerning the photodetection process are described by means of a single entity characterizing the photodetector  the quantum jump superoperator ( qjs ) @xmath0 , that represents the back - action of the detector on the field upon a single photodetection . immediately after the photodetection an initial field state described by the statistical operator @xmath1 changes abruptly to @xmath2 $ ] , and the probability for registering one count during the time interval @xmath3 is @xmath4\\delta t$ ] , where @xmath5 is the time resolution of the detector .",
    "it is supposed that @xmath5 is small compared to other characteristic time scales and that qjs is time - independent , in an ideal case being given by @xmath6where @xmath7 is a lowering operator responsible for subtracting one photon from the field and @xmath8 is roughly the counting rate dmd - job05 with dimension ( time@xmath9 ) .",
    "srinivas and davies proposed _ ad hoc _ @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bosonic lowering operator . in spite of having some inconsistencies as noted by the authors themselves ,",
    "this qjs has been widely used since then .",
    "recently , another qjs defined with @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 ) was proposed , also _ ad hoc _ , in @xcite  we named it ` e - model ' for simplicity .",
    "the differences between these two qjs s were studied in @xcite , showing that the inconsistencies of the sd - model are indeed eliminated .    in @xcite",
    "we have proposed a microscopic model ( some other models were considered in @xcite ) for the field - detector interaction , where we showed that both qjs s proposed _ ad hoc _ are particular cases that can be derived from a general time - dependent ` _ _ transition _ _ ' superoperator . however , there we considered a simplified model of the detector at ` zero temperature ' , by assuming that there were no intrinsic excitations inside the photodetector and that the sensor was at exact resonance with the field mode . here",
    "we relax these conditions , being less stringent , we take into account the effects implied by a ` non - zero temperature ' detector possessing intrinsic excitations and allow a detuning between the field and sensor frequencies .",
    "moreover , we attribute numerical values for the model parameters in order to reproduce experimental data both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "we show that the dark counts appear naturally in our model , and comparing the predicted counting rates and signal - to - noise ratio with experimental data , we get a good qualitative and quantitative agreement .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the actual expression for the qjs should be incremented as ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath14where @xmath15 is roughly the dark counts rate and the operator @xmath16 describes the back - action of the detector on the field due to dark counts .",
    "finally , we point out that by simply modifying the field frequency we are able to engineer the qjs , thus obtaining either the sd - model or e - model in specific regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we model the sensor of the photodetector as a 2-level system , according to the well known jaynes ",
    "cummings model ; taking into account the effects of the sensor ",
    "am coupling , we obtain an explicit form of the transition superoperator , from which we derive a general expression for the qjs . in sec .",
    "iii we compare our results for counting rates with experimental data and obtain specific expressions of the qjs for different field wavelengths .",
    "the section iv contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "we assume the spd as being constituted of two parts : the sensor and the am .",
    "the sensor is modelled as a two - level quantum object with resonant frequency @xmath17 , interacting with the mono - modal em field with frequency @xmath18 ( for multi - modal field one should just consider a frequencies distribution ) .",
    "it has a ground and an excited states @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( before and after the photoabsorptions ) , so we describe it by the usual jaynes ",
    "cummings hamiltonian @xcite ( for its applicability see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) @xmath21where @xmath22 is the sensor - field coupling constant , and the sensor operators are @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we assume @xmath22 being real , since only its absolute value enters the final expressions .    upon absorbing a photon the sensor initially in the ground state jumps to the excited state and",
    "some time later it decays back emitting a photoelectron into the am .",
    "the am is a complex macroscopic structure that depends on the type of spd ; it amplifies the photoelectron and originates some observable macroscopic effect , giving rise to the clicks of the detector . in order to describe general features of the am independent of the type of spd , we model it as a thermal reservoir with a mean intrinsic excitations number @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the whole system field ",
    "spd is described by the effective ` standard master equation ' @xcite @xmath27 -\\gamma \\overline{n}\\left ( \\sigma _ { -}\\sigma _ { + } \\rho _ { t}-2\\sigma _ { + } \\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { -}+\\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { -}\\sigma _ { + } \\right )   \\nonumber   \\label{eqmestra } \\\\ & -&\\gamma \\left ( \\overline{n}+1\\right ) \\left ( \\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}\\rho _ { t}-2\\sigma _ { -}\\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { + } + \\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath28 is the sensor - am coupling constant ( we do not consider the field damping due to cavity losses ) .",
    "according to cpm the trace of qjs gives the probability density @xmath29 for the photodetection , i.e. emission of a photoelectron at time @xmath30 , given that at time @xmath31 the detector - field system was in the state @xmath32where the field state is @xmath1 .",
    "microscopically this means that in the time interval @xmath33 the sensor has undergone a transition @xmath34 due to the absorption of one photon , and @xmath35 is the probability for decaying back to the ground state during the time interval @xmath3 , emitting a photoelectron that will lately originate one click . following the quantum trajectories approach @xcite ,",
    "@xmath36 is calculated from the master - equation ( [ eqmestra ] ) by identifying the sensor decay superoperator @xmath37describing the instantaneous @xmath38 decay and the consequent emission of a photoelectron .",
    "the no - decay superoperator @xmath39 describes the non - unitary evolution of the field ",
    "spd system from @xmath31 to @xmath40 without emission of photoelectrons ; @xmath41 is the solution to the master equation ( [ eqmestra ] ) without the decay term ( [ decay ] ) : @xmath42 where the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian is @xmath43thus the probability density for the observation of a photocount , or a click , at time @xmath30 is equal to @xmath44 , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 represents an evolution of the field - spd system from initial state @xmath46 at time @xmath31 to the time @xmath30 without any decay of the sensor and an instantaneous decay at the time @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , taking the trace only of the detector variables , one obtains the expression describing the action of the detector on the field upon the click  a predecessor of qjs that we call _ transition superoperator _ @xmath47 , \\label{transition}\\]]from which the probability density for a count is @xmath48 } $ ] .",
    "thus , for obtaining the transition superoperator one should first determine the no - decay superoperator @xmath49 and then evaluate eq .",
    "( transition ) using the initial state ( [ rhho0 ] ) . in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ rhou11 ] ) we do the transformation @xmath50 where @xmath51and obtain a simple equation for @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54whose formal solution is @xmath55now one iterates eq .",

    "( [ ttt11 ] ) - ( [ ccc ] ) , the transition superoperator turns out to be time - dependent , contrary to the definition of a qjs .",
    "we proceed as in @xcite , defining the qjs as the time average of the transition superoperator over the time @xmath70 ( to be determined later ) during which the photoelectron is emitted with high probability : @xmath71considering the weak coupling , @xmath72 , under which both the jaynes ",
    "cummings hamiltonian ( [ jch ] ) and the master equation ( [ eqmestra ] ) are valid , and expressing the field density operator in fock basis as @xmath73after the averaging in ( [ j - xi ] ) the off - diagonal elements of @xmath74 vanish due to rapid oscillations of the terms @xmath75 .",
    "this means that the photodetection destroys the coherence of the density matrix .",
    "this can be understood from the point of view of information theory : information flows from the field  sensor system to the am , so decoherence is active ; moreover , since counting photons informs only about diagonal elements , which are proportional to the number of photons , non - diagonal elements can be completely ignored .",
    "therefore , from now on we shall treat only the diagonal elements of @xmath74 in ( [ j - xi ] ) . applying the superoperators @xmath76 on the density matrix as in ( [ ttt11 ] ) ,",

    "we expand the time - dependent functions ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 , eq . ( [ ggg ] ) ) in terms of exponentials and integrate the resulting expressions , obtaining for the second term in ( [ rho - f ] ) ( here for complex @xmath84 defined by eq . ( [ vvv13 ] ) ) @xmath85where @xmath86 in the same manner one can obtain exactly all the further terms , but we shall not write the resulting expressions here .    the qjs ( [ rho - f ] ) contains an infinite number of terms , so every time the detector emits a click , the field state @xmath1 reduces to an incoherent mixture ( due to the decoherence process described above ) of different states , each one with its respective probability .",
    "let us examine these terms more closely .",
    "the first term , with coefficient @xmath87 takes out a photon from the field and modifies the relative weight of the state components , so it represents a click preceded by a photoabsorption  we call this event a ` bright count ' . the second term , dependent on @xmath88 and proportional to @xmath26 ( quite small as will be shown below )",
    ", does not subtract photons from the field but only modifies the relative weight of the state components  it represents the dark count , when the detector emits a click due to the amplification of its intrinsic excitations .",
    "all further terms in eq .",
    "( [ rho - f ] ) are proportional to @xmath89 , @xmath90 ; they describe emissions of several photons into the field upon a click , so we call the first of these term @xmath91 the ` emission term '",
    ". we would like to stress again that all these processes happen simultaneously with different probabilities upon a click of the detector ,",
    "so the post - measurement state of the field is a classical mixture of these events .",
    "we also note that there are many different phenomena that give rise to dark counts karve , kitay , panda ; our model takes into account only those of them that cause the transition of the sensor from the ground to the excited state , and since the sensor state depends on the sensor - field interaction , the dark counts modify indirectly the relative weight between the field components , thus depending on @xmath92 .",
    "the other physical phenomena that do not cause this transition should not in principle modify the relation between the field components and should be expressed by a constant term equal to the corresponding dark counting rate .",
    "we shall not consider these effects since we assume that all the intrinsic excitations occur within the sensor .",
    "now we shall compare the predictions of our model with the available experimental data .",
    "experimentally , the dependences of both bright and dark counting rates are set as functions of the wavelength of the light and the ` bias parameter ' ( bp ) of the detector .",
    "by bp we englobe such quantities as bias voltage , bias current or any other physical parameter the experimentalist adjusts in order to achieve simultaneously the best signal - to - noise ratio @xmath93 and the highest bright counting rate .",
    "@xmath93 is the ratio between the bright counting rate @xmath94 and the dark one @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and it has the following useful property : as one increases the value of bp , the bright counting rates increases while the @xmath93 remains the same until the _ breakdown _ value of bp , after which the @xmath93 starts to fall rapidly as function of bp .",
    "so most detectors usually operate near the breakdown bp in order to achieve the optimal performance .",
    "experimentally @xcite , @xmath94 is determined by directing laser pulses containing single photons at a given repetition rate on the detector and calculating the rate of counts , so in our model it is described by the term @xmath97 ; analogously , @xmath95 is calculated in the absence of any input signal , so it is given by @xmath98 .     at resonance ( @xmath99 nm ) and far from it ( @xmath100 nm ) in the inset . the estimated breakdown value is @xmath101 . ]    to do the comparison with experimental results first we need to set the values of our model free parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath22 , @xmath102 and @xmath26 ; for the sake of better comparison we shall express the frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 in terms of respective wavelengths @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus we are left with only two experimental variables : @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath105 plays the role of bp . meanwhile ,",
    "our general model ca nt take into account the @xmath106 dependence for every kind of detector ; nevertheless , one can argue that bp and @xmath105 must be proportional to each other , since for zero bp one should also have @xmath107 , since in this case the detector would be turned off .",
    "fortunately , we do not need to know the exact dependence of bp on @xmath105 provided we determine the breakdown value @xmath108 corresponding to the breakdown bp at the resonance and take it as a measure of @xmath105 .",
    "so @xmath109 will be our last fixed parameter , even though dependent on the free parameters , needed to compare the model predictions with experiment .",
    "after several numerical simulations we have chosen the following values for our model free parameters that reproduce qualitatively the common experimental behavior @xcite and lie within the applicability region of the jaynes ",
    "cummings hamiltonian ( [ jch ] ) and the master equation ( [ eqmestra ] ) : @xmath110 nm , @xmath111 hz , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , so @xmath114 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "notice that 1 ) the values of @xmath115 at the resonance ( @xmath116 nm , @xmath117 ) and @xmath118 ` far away ' from it ( @xmath119 @xmath120 m , @xmath121 ) are quite realistic , and 2 ) the chosen mean number of intrinsic excitations @xmath26 is much larger than the number of thermal photons as calculated from planck s distribution for room temperature ( @xmath122 ) , meaning that the contribution from defects within the detector is much stronger than the one from thermal photons ( remember that we are considering a specific part of dark counts , as described in section ii ) .",
    "moreover , we verified that below @xmath108 both @xmath94 and @xmath95 depend approximately linearly on @xmath105 , which is in agreement with our qualitative arguments .    , showing that @xmath94 increases proportionally to @xmath105 .",
    "the resonant wavelength is @xmath123 nm . ]    in figure 2 we have a plot of the @xmath94 for two different values of @xmath105 as function of the field wavelength , which shows a good agreement , qualitatively and quantitatively , with experimental results and illustrates the fact that @xmath94 increases proportionally to @xmath105 .",
    "we could confirm numerically that @xmath95 does not depend on the field wavelength as expected , because the dark counts are detector s internal events .",
    "so our model agrees qualitatively in all aspects with the experimental data .",
    "now we turn to our main goal : how the qjs depends on the experimental detector parameters ?",
    "first , we check that for the chosen parameters the _ emission terms _ ( @xmath124 and further terms in eq .",
    "( [ rho - f ] ) ) _ are at least 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the dark counts term and even more for bright counts term _ , which confirms that detectors indeed do not emit photons into the field .",
    "intuitively , the photon emissions by the detector would be possible only at temperatures much higher than room temperature through black body radiation , which is not the case in experiments .     in di - log scale at breakdown @xmath108 for different field wavelengths . at resonance",
    "( @xmath99 nm ) we have @xmath125 and far away from resonance ( @xmath126 nm ) @xmath127 . ]",
    "thus , in practice one is dealing only with bright and dark counts terms that act on the field simultaneously every time a count is registered , so the qjs has the following ( diagonal ) form in fock basis @xmath128 .\\ ] ] in figure 3 we show the dependence of the normalized bright counts term @xmath129 on @xmath92 in di - log scale ( for better visualization we joined the points ) .",
    "we note that near and far away from resonance one has nearly polynomial dependence ( linear in di - log scale ) @xmath130with @xmath131 at resonance and @xmath132 far away from it .",
    "thus , in these cases one can write the operator dependence of bright counts term as @xmath133thus recovering the e - model with @xmath131 at the resonance and sd - model with @xmath132 far away from it ( @xmath134 @xmath120 m ) .",
    "this is an important result : by just modifying the wavelength of the field one can engineer the qjs , obtaining one of the _ ad hoc _ proposals or another .     at breakdown @xmath108 for different field wavelengths and the same graph in di - log scale in the inset . ]",
    "now we turn to the normalized dark counts term @xmath135 , shown in figure 4 in linear scale and in di - log scale in the inset .",
    "first , we see that out of resonance ( @xmath134 @xmath120 m ) @xmath88 is almost independent on @xmath92 , so we can set in this case @xmath136 . at resonance ( @xmath116 nm ) , we see that for @xmath137 one gets @xmath138 and for @xmath139 we have @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 is a number less than @xmath143 .",
    "this means that at resonance the dark counts are suppressed by the presence of light , being generated predominantly by vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument : the dark counts occur when the detector , in the ground state , is intrinsically excited by its excitations ; but at resonance , the rate of excitations by field photons is much greater than the one by the intrinsic excitations , so the dark counts ` have no time ' to appear and therefore become suppressed .",
    "thus , the operator form of the dark counts term in eq .",
    "( [ rho - f ] ) is @xmath144 ,   \\label{123}\\]]where @xmath145 , @xmath146 and at resonance we have e - model with @xmath147 and @xmath148 . far away from the resonance we recover the sd - model with @xmath132 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus by operating near breakdown bp and by varying the wavelength of the field one can engineer the qjs and predict its bright and dark counts terms behavior ; the only inconvenience for obtaining sd - model is that the @xmath93 ratio is smaller than for e - model , since in this case one should operate far away from the resonance . for the sake of completeness we could also add to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 123 ] ) a constant term @xmath150 for the dark counts that do not cause the transition @xmath151 inside the sensor , however the present model does not embraces such phenomena .",
    "we presented a microscopic model for a realistic photodetector in which we modelled it as a 2-level quantum sensor plus a macroscopic amplification mechanism . using the quantum trajectories",
    "approach we deduced a general qjs describing the back - action of the detector on the field upon a photocount and showed that it can be represented formally as an infinite sum of terms . in that sum",
    "we have identified the terms corresponding to the bright counts ( real photoabsorptions ) , the dark counts and emission events , each one occurring with its respective probability .",
    "adjusting the free parameters of the model to fit experimental data , we showed that the emission terms can be disregarded in realistic situations since their contribution becomes insignificant , so the qjs consists effectively only of bright and dark counts terms .",
    "moreover , we reproduced qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental behavior of the counting rates and the signal - to - noise ratio , showing the breakdown phenomenon .",
    "finally , we showed that with the detector operating near its breakdown bias one can engineer the qjs by modifying the wavelength of the field . in particular , one recovers the qjs s proposed previously _",
    "ad hoc _ : at resonance one gets the e - model , and far away from it the sd - model is identified .",
    "last but not least , the contribution of the dark counts to the qjs was derived within the context of a photocount model .",
