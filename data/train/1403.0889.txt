    "ferromagnetic half - metals such as cro@xmath1 and heusler alloys are key materials for technological applications , e.g. , spin - injection devices , spin filters , tunnel junctions and giant magnetoresistance devices .",
    "heusler alloys have various advantages that make them attractive for applications .",
    "one is the relatively high curie temperature as compared with other half - metallic systems .",
    "the other is the structural similarity to the zinc - blende structure , which is adopted by binary semiconductors widely used in technology . in particular",
    ", the nimn@xmath2 ( @xmath2 = si , p , ge , as ) family of compounds seems to be promising in this context .",
    "@xcite for example , nimnsi has been predicted to have a curie temperature of 1050  k , @xcite exceeding the 730  k of nimnsb , @xcite which calls for a detailed study of the electronic and magnetic properties of heterostructures containing this compound .",
    "the functionality of nanoscale devices depends crucially on the transport across the interfaces between the different components .",
    "thus , the electronic and magnetic properties at interfaces have attracted huge interest in recent years .",
    "it has been shown by theoretical calculations as well as experiments that the half - metallicity of heusler alloys is lost at surfaces and interfaces due to symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite however , it has also been argued that the half - metallicity is conserved when the s atoms sit exactly on top of the sb atoms at the nimnsb / cds ( 111 ) contact .",
    "@xcite the same phenomenon appears at the nimnsb / inp ( 111 ) contact when the p atoms sit exactly on top of the sb atoms .",
    "@xcite both cases are interfaces between nimnsb and a semiconductor and have the anion - anion bonds at the interface .",
    "in fact , the ( 111 ) interfaces are special in this respect , and thus generally promising to conserve half - metallicity , whereas in ( 100 ) interfaces , for example , the anions are coordinated by a mixture of main - group and transition metals .",
    "we will show that half - metallicity is indeed preserved at the ( 111 ) interface between the half - heusler alloy nimnsi and the insulator mgo . in the following , two orientations of the nimnsb(si)/mgo interface",
    "are investigated : the ( 100 ) interface as it is most commonly applied in experiments , and the ( 111 ) interface as it contains only one component in each plane .",
    "calculations have been performed for supercells consisting of nimnsb or nimnsi and mgo , using the projector augmented wave method @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation @xcite and density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite in order to take into account all degrees of freedom for the nimnsb / mgo ( 100 ) , nimnsb / mgo ( 111 ) and nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) interfaces , we have conducted full structural optimizations for the cell parameters and internal coordinates . a plane - wave basis set with 450 ev energy cutoff is used ; the convergence criterion of the total energy change is set to 10@xmath3 ev .",
    "the @xmath4-point mesh is taken as @xmath5 for the ( 100 ) interfaces and @xmath6 for the ( 111 ) interfaces .",
    "all technical parameters have been tested carefully to ensure accurate results .",
    "for the calculations we employ the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) .",
    "@xcite    the crystal structure of the half - heusler alloys nimnsb and nimnsi is face centered cubic ( @xmath73 m ) , consisting of four sublattices : ni at the ( 0,0,0 ) , mn at the ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) , sb or si at the ( 3/4,3/4,3/4 ) and vacancies at the ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) sites . the calculated lattice constant of nimnsb ( 5.91   ) is within 1% accuracy to the experimental value ( 5.93   ) , @xcite whereas nimnsi has not yet been grown experimentally .",
    "however , a lattice constant of 5.4    has been theoretically obtained in ref .  , which agrees well with our value of 5.37   .",
    "the [ 100 ] direction of nimnsb and [ 110 ] direction of mgo show a nearly perfect lattice match , whereas the lattice mismatch between nimnsi ( 100 ) and mgo ( 100 ) is about 10% .",
    "this explains why the nimnsb / mgo interface could be realized experimentally , @xcite but not the nimnsi / mgo ( 100 ) system .    for the ( 100 ) interface we employ multiple supercells with 15 layers of nimnsb and nine layers of mgo .",
    "this thickness is sufficient for the central regions of both the half - metal and the mgo to exhibit their bulk properties . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ structure-100 ] , by building four supercells we construct all possible interfaces with four different terminations , where the two interfaces within one supercell possess the same configuration .",
    "for the ( 111 ) interface the supercells consist of 25 layers of nimnsb or nimnsi and 13 layers of mgo with sb / o or si / o contacts .",
    "more structural details will be elaborated in the following section .",
    "( a ) and 17.44 @xmath8 ( d).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0%](a ) +   ( a ) and 17.44 @xmath8 ( d).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0%](b ) +   ( a ) and 17.44 @xmath8 ( d).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0%](c ) +   ( a ) and 17.44 @xmath8 ( d).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0%](d )    .bond lengths at the nimnsb / mgo ( 100 ) interfaces . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ moments-111 ]    details of the nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) interface are provided in table  [ details-111 ] . since the two interfaces , i and ii , differ slightly , it is not possible to extract @xmath9 and @xmath10 individually by computing the energy difference analogous to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and dividing by two .",
    "thus , for definiteness , we present only the aggregate work of separation , @xmath11 ev . note . however , that both , i and ii , have direct si - o bonds at the interface , and differ only in the second neighboring atomic layer to o ( ni for interface i vs.  vacancies for interface ii ) .",
    "hence we may assume that the individual works of separation , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are not so different from each other . together with the large value obtained , we therefore conclude that both interfaces are energetically stable .",
    "the average spin magnetic moments per atom at the interface are given in table  [ moments-111 ] , considering the first three layers of nimnsi and the first two layers of mgo .",
    "atoms in the atomic layer furthest away from the interface show bulk - like moments . for interface i",
    "the mn moment in the sub - sub - interface layer is very close to the bulk value , whereas the ni and si moments are considerably larger than their bulk values .",
    "the total magnetic moment of interface i shows little difference from the bulk since mn carries most of it . for interface ii the mn moment increases by 0.2@xmath12 as compared with interface i and the bulk value , due to the vacancy layer next to it , which suppresses hybridization between the mn and ni @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "after structural optimization of the ( 111 ) interface a relatively large reconstruction , as compared with the ( 100 ) interface , is encountered as a consequence of the low symmetry and the presence of two nonequivalent interfaces .",
    "the atoms in the interface layers are shifted away from their initial positions ( bulk structure ) , where the average difference in the @xmath14-coordinates of the si and o atoms is 1.86    and 1.25    for interface i and ii , respectively .",
    "this is much shorter than the bond lengths at interfaces with 100% spin polarization discovered so far , such as nimnsb / cds ( 111 ) with a sb - s bond length of 2.7  (ref .  ) and nimnsb / inp ( 111 ) with a sb - p bond length of 2.61    ( ref .  ) .",
    "the authors of these studies have suggested that the rather long bonds for the latter two structures might be essential for the conservation of half - metallicity .",
    "our results for nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) , however , indicate that long bond lengths are not a necessary condition .",
    "it must be noted that half - metallicity only persists in nimnsb / cds and nimnsb / inp when the structural optimization is partial ( no interface relaxation ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown in refs .   that a full structural optimization leads to considerable reconstruction between interface layers and consequently a significant suppression of the spin polarization .",
    "in contrast , for the nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) interface studied here a 100% spin polarization is obtained after full structural optimization , whereas a drastic polarization decrease is found for partial relaxation , i.e. , when only the in - plane atomic positions and the @xmath14-axis are optimized .",
    "thus , the nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) scenario is , unexpectedly , at variance with the usual understanding of the loss of half - metallicity by disorder and interdiffusion at the interface . whether the scenario of the full structural optimization is closer to reality depends , of course , on the actual experimental conditions .",
    "we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of the ( 100 ) interface between the heusler alloy nimnsb and the insulator mgo .",
    "a full structural optimization has been performed , showing that mnsb / omg termination leads to the most favorable interface .",
    "we find that the half - metallic property of the bulk heusler alloy is lost at the interface .",
    "the spin polarization at the mnsb - terminated interface is @xmath0% , whereas ni termination suppresses it drastically , due to strong oxidation of ni . for the nimnsb / mgo ( 111 ) interface the spin polarization at the fermi level",
    "is also lost , but the energy gap in the minority band still exists .",
    "this opens up the possibility of shifting the fermi level back by proper doping .",
    "for the nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) interface , on the other hand , half - metallicity is maintained at both interfaces i and ii . besides , short bonds between si and o are formed .",
    "all these results apply to the structures after full optimization , including in - plane and out - of - plane relaxation .",
    "however , the spin polarization at the interface significantly deteriorates when only the in - plane atomic coordinates and the @xmath14-axis of the supercell are optimized .",
    "our results thus suggest that it is promising to investigate experimentally the growth of nimnsi ( 111 ) on mgo ( 111 ) substrates , to shed further light on the mechanisms relevant for the fate of half - metallicity at interfaces .",
    "in addition , nimnsi / mgo ( 111 ) could be another attractive heterostructure for spintronics applications .",
