    "since the 1960s , the frequent presence of alfvn waves or alfvnic fluctuations has been identified from in situ observations of solar wind fluctuations over the radial range from 0.3 to 20 au and from the ecliptic plane to high - latitudes ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the alfvnic fluctuations ( afs ) mostly originate from the sun and thus mostly propagate in the anti - sunward direction . in general , the flow velocity fluctuations are negatively / positively correlated with magnetic field fluctuations in the anti - sunward ( sunward ) heliospheric magnetic field sector .    the interactions of counter - propagating afs are thought to be an important source of solar wind plasma heating and decreasing alfvnicity @xcite .",
    "however , only a few clear events of sunward - propagating alfvnic fluctuations ( safs ) are reported in the literature . @xcite and @xcite found that discrete safs are rare in the pristine solar wind at 1 au .",
    "@xcite performed a limited search for the signatures of discrete safs in the _ ace _ and _ wind _ data and identified a limited number of periods with safs .",
    "they found that safs were found only ( 1 ) in events associated with back - streaming ions from the earth s bow shock , ( 2 ) immediately up and down stream from reverse shocks associated with corotating interaction regions or interplanetary coronal mass ejections , and ( 3 ) in events identified as reconnection exhausts .",
    "recently , @xcite utilized a new criterion to identify the upstream - propagating alfvnic intervals in the upstream region of the earth s bow shock and found both upstream - propagating afs with a power spectral bump due to the linear ion beam instability and upstream - propagating afs with power law spectra due to a nonlinear wave - wave interaction .",
    "@xcite later reported the first observation of safs in the solar wind at 1 au in the region magnetically disconnected from the earth s bow shock .",
    "@xcite used elssser variables to represent the anti - sunward ( @xmath0 ) and sunward ( @xmath1 ) sense of propagation with respect to the sun , and discussed the nature of the sunward component of afs at 0.3 au .",
    "@xcite later adopted the similar analysis methodology and studied the evolution of the anti - sunward and sunward components of afs in the solar wind both at high - latitudes and in the ecliptic plane .",
    "however , these authors acknowledge doubt as to whether or not @xmath1 fluctuations , at scales smaller than 1 hour , represent safs . for example , @xmath1 can be the sunward - propagating quasi - perpendicular slow - mode waves , which have been clearly identified by @xcite in the compressible solar wind turbulence .",
    "the power spectral density of @xmath1 in 2d wave - vector space , which is derived using a spectral tomography method as introduced by @xcite , shows a quite different distribution from that of @xmath0 , with the former being more quasi - perpendicular and dominated by magnetic field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "such differences suggest that @xmath1 may not necessarily be the safs as previously conceived .    to our knowledge ,",
    "no case of safs beyond 1 au has previously been reported .",
    "the statistical properties of safs with different heliocentric distances are still unknown . using measurements from the _ voyager _ 2 and",
    "_ wind _ spacecraft , we present the first two clear cases of safs observed beyond 1 au , far from the foreshock regions of planets .",
    "based on a statistical survey , we find that the percentage of safs increases gradually with heliocentric distance .",
    "the present analysis uses the solar wind plasma and magnetic field data from _ voyager _ 2 during 1977 and 1979 and from _ wind _ during 1998 and 1999 .",
    "these two time periods are both in the rising phase of the solar cycle .    _ voyager _ 2 was launched on august 20 , 1977 and continues to explore the heliosphere .",
    "plasma data from the pls instrument @xcite have a sampling period of 12 seconds inside of 3 au , of 96 seconds from 3 to 6 au , and of 192 seconds beyond 6 au .",
    "the magnetic field data are from the mag instrument @xcite ; we use averages of the field data over the plasma measurement cycle . during 1977 and 1979 , _ voyager _ 2 was in the ecliptic plane inside of 6 au .",
    "thus , the resolution of _ voyager _ 2 data combined plasma and magnetic field are chosen to be 48 or 96 seconds , which is adequate for studying afs with period larger than 100 or 200 seconds .",
    "the data during the jupiter observation phase have been excluded to eliminate the interference of the planetary bow shock , since safs may be produced by back - streaming ions from the planetary bow shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the approach of @xcite is used to identify interplanetary afs .",
    "compared to conventional waln test methods , the dehoffmann - teller ( ht ) frame and the background magnetic field are not needed to be determined in advance .",
    "thus , the uncertainties introduced in the determinations of these two parameters could be reduced .",
    "we here use the band - pass filtered signals of the plasma velocity and magnetic field observations , instead of the original data sets , to check the waln relation .",

    "several parameters are defined to represent the alfvnicity , such as the alfvn ratio , the waln slope , the normalized cross helicity , the normalized residual energy , and the velocity - magnetic field correlation coefficient ( see * ? ? ?",

    "for example , the alfvn ratio , the normalized cross helicity and the normalized residual energy themselves do not necessarily require that the fluctuations of velocity and magnetic field correlate well .",
    "a good velocity  magnetic field correlation coefficient does not guarantee that the fluctuations match the waln relation .",
    "thus , we use a more reliable quantity proposed by @xcite , @xmath9 , to assess the goodness of the waln test and the degree of alfvnicity .    for each time series , we calculate @xmath3 and @xmath4 for different frequency filters . for each filtered data set , we calculate the following eight parameters : 1 ) @xmath10 ; 2 ) @xmath11 ; 3 ) @xmath12 ; 4 ) @xmath13 ; 5 ) @xmath14 ; 6 ) @xmath15 ; 7 ) @xmath16 ; 8) @xmath17 . here",

    "the mean magnetic field is often assumed to be a proxy .",
