    "today supersymmetric models are given priority in the search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this is primarily suggested by theoretical arguments related to the hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry eliminates the sensitivity for the highest scale in the theory and , thus , stabilizes the low energy theory .",
    "flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes provide crucial guidelines for supersymmetry model building . in the so - called unconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( umssm )",
    "there are new sources for fcnc transitions . besides the cabibbo ",
    "kobayashi  maskawa ( ckm)-induced contributions , there are generic supersymmetric contributions induced by flavour mixing in the squark mass matrices .",
    "the structure of the umssm does not explain the suppression of fcnc processes , which is observed in experiments ; this is the crucial point of the well - known supersymmetric flavour problem . within the framework of the mssm",
    "there are at present three favoured supersymmetric models that solve the supersymmetric flavour problem by a specific mechanism through which the sector of supersymmetry breaking communicates with the sector accessible to experiments : in the minimal supergravity model ( msugra )  @xcite , supergravity is the corresponding mediator ; in the other two models , this is achieved by gauge interactions  @xcite and by anomalies  @xcite . furthermore , there are other classes of models in which the flavour problem is solved by particular flavour symmetries  @xcite .",
    "flavour violation thus originates from the interplay between the dynamics of flavour and the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "fcnc processes therefore yield important ( indirect ) information on the construction of supersymmetric extensions of the sm and can contribute to the question of which mechanism ultimately breaks supersymmetry .",
    "the experimental measurements of the rates for these processes , or the upper limits set on them , impose in general a reduction of the large number and size of parameters in the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms present in these models . among these processes , those involving transitions between first- and second - generation quarks , namely fcnc processes in the @xmath3 system , are considered as the most formidable tools to shape viable supersymmetric flavour models .",
    "moreover , the tight experimental bounds on some flavour - diagonal transitions , such as the electric dipole moment of the electron and of the neutron , as well as @xmath4 , help constraining soft terms inducing chirality violations .    among neutral flavour transitions involving the third generation ,",
    "the rare decay @xmath0 is at present the most important one , as it is the only inclusive mode which is already measured  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical sm prediction , up to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) precision  @xcite for its branching ratio , is in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "although the experimental errors are still rather large , this decay mode already allows for theoretically clean and rather stringent constraints on the parameter space of various extensions of the sm ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "once more precise data from the b factories are available , this decay will undoubtedly gain efficiency in selecting the viable regions of the parameter space in the above classes of models ; it may also help discriminating among the models that will be proposed by then .",
    "in this paper we present a model - independent analysis of the decay @xmath5 , based on a ll - qcd calculation , where contributions from @xmath6-bosons , charged higgs bosons , charginos , neutralinos and gluinos are systematically included .",
    "former analyses in the unconstrained mssm neglected qcd corrections and only used the gluino contribution to saturate the experimental bounds . technically , the so - called mass insertion approximation ( mia ) was used where the off - diagonal elements of the squark mass matrices are taken to be small and their higher powers neglected . as a consequence of this single insertion approximation ,",
    "no correlations between different sources of flavour violation were taken into account . in this way",
    ", one arrived at order - of - magnitude bounds on the soft parameters  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the sensitivity of the bounds on the down squark mass matrix to radiative qcd corrections was analysed including the sm and the gluino contributions .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend this analysis to include the contributions from charged higgs bosons , charginos and neutralinos and their interference effects , and even more important , the effects that result when several flavour violating parameters , i.e. several off - diagonal elements in the squark mass matrices , are switched on simultaneously .",
    "we anticipate that two simple combinations of matrix elements of the down squark mass matrix remain rather stringently bounded over large parts of the parameter space , in a general scenario where only relatively weak assumptions on pattern of the squark mass matrices are made .    since there are different contributions to this decay , with different numerical impact on its rate , some of these flavour - violating terms may turn out to be poorly constrained .",
    "thus , given the generality of such a calculation , it is convenient to rely on the mass eigenstate formalism , which remains valid even when some of the intergenerational mixing elements are large , and not to use the approximate mass insertion method , where the off - diagonal squark mass matrix elements are taken to be small and their higher powers neglected . in the latter approach the reliability of the approximation can only be checked a posteriori .",
    "finally , we note that the off - diagonal elements of the squark mass matrices can get constraints on completely different grounds , namely from the requirement of the absence of charge and colour breaking minima as well as from directions in the scalar potential which are unbounded from below ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . however , these bounds correspond to sufficient , but not necessary conditions for the stability of the standard vacuum , because it is possible that we live in a metastable vacuum , whose lifetime is longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the framework for the calculation of the branching ratio for @xmath0 . in section 3",
    ", we briefly recall the sources of flavour violation , encoded in the squark mass matrices . in section 4 , we present the phenomenological analysis on the bounds on the flavour violating parameters . in section 5 ,",
    "we briefly explore up to which values susy contributions , allowed by , can enhance the wilson coefficient @xmath1 , which plays an important role in the phenomenology of charmless hadronic @xmath2 decays . in section 6",
    "we give a short summary . in appendix a1 , we state our conventions , while in appendix a2 we list the wilson coefficients at the matching scale .",
    "in the sm , rare @xmath2-meson decays are induced by one - loop diagrams in which @xmath6 bosons and up - type quarks propagate .",
    "the most important corrections to the decay amplitude for @xmath8 are due to exchanges of gluons , which give rise to powers of the factor @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that each of these logarithms is accompanied by at least one factor of @xmath10 .",
    "since the two scales @xmath11 and @xmath12 are far apart , @xmath13 is a large number and these terms need to be resummed : at the leading logarithmic ( ll ) order , powers of @xmath14 are resummed ; at the next - to - leading ( nll ) order , also the terms of the form @xmath15 are systematically resummed .",
    "thus , the contributions to the decay amplitude are classified according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi constant .",
    "the resummation of these corrections is usually achieved by making use of the formalism of effective hamiltonians , combined with renormalization group techniques .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath18 , obtained by integrating out the top - quark and the @xmath6 boson , can be written as @xmath19 the wilson coefficients @xmath20 contain all dependence on the heavy degrees of freedom , whereas the operators @xmath21 depend on light fields only .",

    "the bounds are essentially unchanged if the other two parameters @xmath161 and @xmath222 , are varied over the complete range of values given above .",

    "particularly , for @xmath260 and @xmath261 , the term @xmath186 is of the same magnitude as the diagonal entries of the squark mass matrix .",
    "thus , the contributions to the wilson coefficients of the five - dimensional gluino operators ( induced by @xmath186 in combination with @xmath187 or @xmath188 ) become important enough to weaken the bounds on @xmath232 and @xmath233 significantly .",
    "the relative importance of this @xmath86 term is of course increased if the general soft squark mass scale @xmath161 is decreased as can be read off from fig .",
    "[ allx1 ] .",
    "second , within the large @xmath48 regime the contributions from charginos get enhanced and therefore also weaken the bounds on @xmath233 .",
    "these features are illustrated in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta50 ] . in the first frame",
    "we take over the specific scenario with @xmath262 and @xmath263 from fig .",
    "[ allx1 ] . to show that the term @xmath186 is indeed one of the reasons for the weakening of the bounds , we present in the right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta50 ] the corresponding scenario when @xmath186 is set to zero .",
    "we see that we regain better bounds on @xmath232 and also on @xmath233 .",
    "however , we also see that the bound on @xmath233 remains weak .",
    "this , and the resulting asymmetry , is due to a large chargino contribution for @xmath262 .",
    "we recall that there is no chargino contribution to the primed operator which could influence the bound on @xmath232 .",
    "we can also explore how the bounds behave if we vary the parameter @xmath134 .",
    "until now we used the value @xmath264 . because the parameter @xmath186 is actually proportional to the product of @xmath48 and @xmath134 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ffterm ] ) ) , we conclude from the findings above that the bound on @xmath232 is unchanged if we increase the value of @xmath134 and decrease the value of @xmath48 such that the product of both parameters is constant ; the bound on @xmath233 is then even stronger because the chargino contribution is smaller for increasing @xmath134 . consequently , one finds a smaller asymmetry in the corresponding plots ( compare the left frame in fig .",
