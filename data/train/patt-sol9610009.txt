    "traffic flow is one of the most interesting phenomena of many - body systems which may be controlled by basic dynamical equation .",
    "recent developments in study of traffic flow has brought a renewed interest in microscopic approaches , such as optimal velocity model ( ov - model ) @xcite , which is a new version of car following model @xcite , cellular automaton models @xcite , coupled map lattice models @xcite and fluid dynamical models @xcite .",
    "the ov - model , among others , has especially attracted interest because it provides us with a possibility of unified understanding of both free and congested traffic flows from common basic dynamical equations . unlike traditional car following models",
    ", it introduces optimal velocity function @xmath5 as a desirable velocity depending on headway distance @xmath1 .",
    "the basic equation of ov - model for a series of vehicles on a circuit of length @xmath6 is , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the position of the @xmath9-th vehicle , @xmath10 headway and @xmath11 the total vehicle number .",
    "the constant parameter @xmath4 is the sensitivity .",
    "a driver accelerates ( or decelerates ) his vehicle in proportion to the difference between his velocity and the optimal velocity @xmath5 .",
    "as easily noticed , a homogeneous flow is a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ovm0 ] ) .",
    "in such a flow , vehicles have a common headway @xmath12 , which is the inverse of the vehicle density .",
    "stability of homogeneous flows is analyzed within a linear approximation@xcite ; it is stable for @xmath13 and unstable for @xmath14 .",
    "the critical value is found to be @xmath15 .    in order to demonstrate that the ov - model describes `` spontaneous generation of congestion '' ,",
    "numerical simulations were made using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ovm0 ] ) .",
    "it was found that for @xmath16 , i.e. , if the density is above the critical value , a slightly perturbed homogeneous flow develops to a congested flow after enough time .",
    "the congested flow consists of alternating two distinct regions ; congested regions ( high density ) , and smoothly moving regions or free regions ( low density ) . in this way",
    "the traffic congestion occurs spontaneously in the ov - model .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as a sort of phase transition from a homogeneous flow state to a congested flow state @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the well - established congested flow is that the velocity of the @xmath9-th vehicle @xmath17 has the same time dependence as that of the preceding ( @xmath18-th ) vehicle except a certain time delay @xmath0 .",
    "it is also found that the global pattern moves backward with a velocity @xmath3 .",
    "this kind of behavior of vehicles may be called `` repetitive pattern formation '' .",
    "it leads to formation of a closed trajectory ( `` limit cycle '' ) on @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , along which representative points for all the vehicles move one after another .",
    "the convergence of vehicles trajectories to a closed trajectory signals the congestion in a traffic flow . therefore the determination of the closed trajectory is one of the most important subjects to understand congested flows .",
    "however this has been done mostly in computer simulations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain this closed trajectory directly by an analytical method .",
    "actually it has been found that , in the vicinity of the critical point for the congested flow , equation ( [ eq : ovm0 ] ) can be reduced to the modified kdv equation by the dynamical reduction method @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a new analytical approach to the pattern formation , which may be applicable to any congested flow .",
    "we argue that , once the repetitive pattern is formed , the coupled car following equations reduce to a single difference - differential equation ( rondo equation ) for a universal function ( rondo function ) . a rondo function determines a closed trajectory on @xmath1-@xmath2 plane . to make the rondo equation tractable , we have simplified our question on the following two points : firstly we have assumed that ov - functions are piece - wise linear ; secondly we have concentrated our attention to an asymptotic trajectory , which is the key concept to be explained in the next section .",
    "we would like to stress that our method does not lose its generality by making the above assumption on ov - functions : an ov - function to be obtained from real data may be approximated by a piece - wise linear function .    with the above simplifications , we have solved the rondo equation for each model and given an asymptotic trajectory on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "our result clearly tells us that , once an ov - function and the sensitivity @xmath4 are given , an asymptotic trajectory is uniquely determined ; this then implies that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 for a collective motion of vehicles are given as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore our approach provides us with a method to determine @xmath4 dependence of the global parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section summarizes the main results obtained from numerical simulations of the ov - model , with emphasis on the pattern formation in a congested flow .",
    "the concept of an asymptotic trajectory is explained in this section . as will become clear in later sections ,",
    "an asymptotic trajectory is a very important concept to understand the ov - model .",
    "we derive the difference - differential equation and present a general strategy on how to solve it in section  [ sec : rondo approach ] .",
    "this part summarizes the central idea of this paper . in order to demonstrate how the rondo approach works , we analytically solve , in section  [ sec : piece - wise linear ] , some simple models with piece - wise linear ov - functions .",
    "our first model has been investigated by sugiyama and yamada@xcite . here",
    "we solve this model in the context of the rondo approach .",
    "although an asymptotic trajectory is very close to a real trajectory observed in a computer simulation , it is not exactly the same to the latter .",
    "we describe some aspects of real trajectories based on our knowledge of the asymptotic one in section  [ sec : trajectories around cusps ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "let us recollect what we have learned with numerical simulations of an ov - model @xcite .",
    "suppose a simulation is performed with a given ov - function and a fixed sensitivity @xmath4 .",
    "after a congested flow is well - established , typical features of the repetitive behavior can be observed in the following two figures .",
    "= 8.2 cm = 8.0 cm    figs .",
    "[ fig : intro.traje.eps](a ) and ( b ) show that vehicles move in alternating regions of free and congested flows .",
    "it is recognized that every vehicle behaves in the same manner as its preceding one with a certain time delay @xmath0 : as a result , the congested region moves backward with the velocity @xmath3 .",
    "once the location of any vehicle , say , the @xmath9-th vehicle , is given as a function of @xmath19 , we may reproduce the pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro.traje.eps](a ) by plotting a series of functions shifted in time and position by @xmath0 and @xmath20 appropriately . therefore we expect that a congested flow may be completely determined by a function of @xmath19 and global parameters @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "the precise specifications of our approach to this repetitive behavior will be explained in the next section .",
    "[ fig : intro.traje.eps](b ) clearly shows there exists a `` limit cycle '' on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , a closed curve with two cusps at points c @xmath21 and f @xmath22 , both of which are on the ov - function . at these cusp points ,",
    "we find @xmath23 , which means that homogeneous flows with such headways and velocities are linearly stable .",
    "representative points for all vehicles move on this `` limit cycle '' in the same direction as anti - clockwise .",
    "it follows from the conservation of flow , @xmath24 that the straight line connecting c and f has the slope @xmath25 and intersects with the vertical axis at @xmath26 .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we would like to explain the concept of an asymptotic trajectory on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "suppose that a vehicle passes through two congested regions different in size on a circuit .",
    "then the representative point moves on curves as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - point.eps ] .",
    "each trajectory may not form an actual cusp , rather it will form a round shaped tip .",
    "also we find that the larger the congested region , the sharper the shape of the tip : the minimum velocity of the vehicle is smaller for a longer congestion .",
    "it is rather easy to imagine that for a very short congestion the vehicle can not decelerate itself enough to reach the velocity appropriate for a longer congested region . if we plot minimum velocities for longer and longer congested regions , we would find a limiting value for the minimum velocities .",
    "this value must be realized for an infinitely long congested region . with a similar argument",
    "we find the limiting value for maximum velocities corresponding to an infinitely long free region .",
    "we may imagine the following extreme situation : a vehicle starting from an infinitely long free ( congested ) region goes toward an infinitely long congested ( free ) region .",
    "the trajectory for this limiting situation will be called as a decelerating ( an accelerating ) asymptotic trajectory . combining them we would find a closed curve with two real cusps on the ov - function .",
    "the duration for a vehicle to stay in a congested region would obviously get longer for a larger congested region .",
    "for an asymptotic trajectory it becomes infinite .",
    "this does fit to our linear analysis since the behavior of a vehicle is controlled by exponential functions in time . in section  [ sec : trajectories around cusps ] , we shall see that exponential functions determine a curve near a cusp .",
    "we begin our description of the rondo approach with two basic assumptions :    1 .",
    "velocities of the @xmath9-th and @xmath27-th vehicles have exactly the same time dependence if a certain time delay @xmath0 is taken into account , @xmath28 .",
    "the pattern of traffic flow moves backward with a constant velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the above described properties are expressed as , @xmath29 all the vehicles behavior is represented with a single universal function @xmath30 ; for the wave equation . ] @xmath31 with @xmath9-th vehicle s headway given as @xmath32 @xmath11 coupled car following equations ( [ eq : ovm0 ] ) are reduced to a single difference - differential equation for @xmath33 , @xmath34 in the following it will be called the rondo equation .    in this paper , we will seek the rondo function @xmath33 for the asymptotic trajectory . before studying concrete models ,",
    "let us consider its generic properties . since the position and the velocity of vehicles are obviously continuous in time , @xmath33 is a continuously differentiable function .",
    "an asymptotic trajectory connects the points f and c , each of which corresponds to an infinitely long free or congested region ( an approximately homogeneous flow ) satisfying the stability condition mentioned in section  [ sec : pattern formation ]",
    ". therefore @xmath33 should be homogeneous flows asymptotically in the infinite past and future : @xmath35 const . as @xmath36 .",
    "an asymptotic trajectory interpolates two stable solutions of the equation ( [ eq : ovm0 ] ) . in this sense @xmath33",
    "may be regarded as a `` kink solution ''",
    ".    like ov - models studied in earlier papers , each model in the next section has an ov - function which is symmetric with respect to a point , s@xmath37 .",
    "so we assume this property in the following arguments and quote our result in appendix  [ ap - sec : symmetric ] .",
    "two end points of an asymptotic trajectory , c@xmath21 and f@xmath22 , are symmetric with respect to s. three points c , f and s are on a straight line with a slope @xmath25 and an intersection @xmath26 .",
    "note that once the slope is given , the intersection is uniquely determined since the point s must be on the line .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ ap - sec : symmetric ] , accelerating and decelerating asymptotic trajectories are symmetric with respect to s. therefore it is sufficient to study one of them ; in the rest of this paper , we will take an decelerating asymptotic trajectory . here",
    "we summarize conditions which should be satisfied by the function @xmath33 :    1 .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath38 are continuous for any @xmath19 ( @xmath39 ) ; 2 .",

    "( 1 ) first we give the parameter @xmath0 . by drawing a straight line through the point",
    "s with the slope @xmath25 , we find the intersection @xmath26 and the points c and f. ( 2 ) now @xmath4 is the only free parameter of the rondo equation .",
    "if we could solve the equation , we would obtain a one - parameter family of ( or @xmath4-dependent ) rondo functions .",
    "( 3 ) among this family , the right rondo function is selected by requiring that it connects the points c and f. this condition also determines a unique value for @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly we find the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider here a class of models with piece - wise linear ov - functions .",

    "when the symmetry is absent , accelerating and decelerating asymptotic trajectories are not related each other and must be found independently .",
    "the condition that both of them share the same end points c and f will determine the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "even though we have mainly studied asymptotic trajectories , the rondo equation itself must be applicable for any repetitive motion of vehicles .",
    "on the other hand , as we have observed for piece - wise linear models , the difference between asymptotic trajectories and the results of computer simulations are very small .",
    "therefore whether we would like to obtain a realistic trajectory out of the rondo approach or not is very much dependent of our purpose .",

    "( [ eq : functional ] ) in the approach ( 1 ) , we need the rondo function describing a part of the asymptotic trajectory coming out of f ; the rest of the asymptotic trajectory may be obtained just by differentiating the initial function repeatedly .",
    "so the initial rondo function is of vital importance .",
    "since the ov - function is symmetric , the transcendental equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) may be used to find the initial rondo function .",
    "let us remember how solutions are distributed .",
    "there are only two real solutions , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , and infinitely many complex solutions whose real parts are larger than @xmath249 .",

    "therefore it contains infinitely many coefficients , which must be determined to give an asymptotic trajectory with properties described in section 3 . to find an asymptotic trajectory in this way",
    ", we probably need some new techniques .",
    "in this paper we have considered the repetitive pattern in traffic flow .",
    "such repetitive structure is also observed in various phenomena , and we believe that our approach may be helpful to understand them .",
