    "the _ curve graph _ @xmath0 of a surface @xmath5 is a graph whose vertices are homotopy classes of simple closed curves on @xmath5 , with two vertices joined by an edge when the curves have disjoint representatives . assigning length 1 to each edge allows us to define the distance between two vertices as the length of a shortest path between two vertices .",
    "the graph @xmath0 is the 1-skeleton of the _ curve complex _",
    "@xmath6 , a metric space and a simplicial complex that was introduced in the early 1970 s by w. harvey @xcite . during the past 15 years",
    "a new and highly successful attack was made , in the groundbreaking papers of masur and minsky @xcite , in understanding the large - scale or ` coarse ' geometry of @xmath6 . in that work",
    "it was necessary to overcome difficulties created by two types of local pathology in @xmath0 .",
    "the first is that @xmath0 is locally infinite , that is there are infinitely many vertices that are distance 1 from any given vertex .",
    "the second is that , typically , there are infinitely many distinct geodesics joining vertices @xmath7 , where geodesics are regarded as being distinct when there is no homeomorphism of the surface taking the curves on one to the curves on the other . in this paper",
    "we will prove that there is yet another local pathology which , surprisingly , seems to have not been noticed as such .",
    "a vertex @xmath8 is a _",
    "dead end _ with respect to a vertex @xmath4 if no geodesic @xmath9 joining @xmath4 to @xmath3 can be extended past @xmath3 to a longer geodesic .",
    "the _ depth _ of a dead - end in a geodesic of length @xmath10 is the number of edges one must follow backwards from the dead end to reach a vertex from which the shortened geodesic can be extended to a geodesic of length @xmath11 these concepts are familiar ones in geometric group theory , where groups have been identified whose cayley graphs have dead ends , and even dead ends of arbitrarily large depth , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "the main result in this paper is to prove that dead ends exist ( and indeed are ubiquitous ) in @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", we will also prove that every dead end has depth 1 .",
    "to state our results , let @xmath12 be an orientable surface of genus @xmath13 with @xmath10 boundary components or punctures , @xmath14 .",
    "a curve on @xmath15 is _ essential _ if does not bound either a disc or an annulus parallel to a component of @xmath16 .",
    "in this note we will prove :    [ t : main theorem ] let @xmath7 be essential curves on @xmath17 , and also ( by an abuse of notation ) vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "then the following hold :    1 .",
    "if @xmath3 is non - separating as a curve on @xmath17 , then @xmath3 can not be a dead - end with respect to any vertex @xmath4 in the curve graph .",
    "2 .   let @xmath2 with @xmath18 .",
    "then necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath3 to be a dead end with respect to @xmath4 are ( i ) the curve @xmath3 separates @xmath15 in such a way that both components of @xmath17 split along @xmath3 support essential curves , and ( ii ) there exist distinct geodesics , @xmath19 and @xmath20 joining @xmath4 to @xmath3 , such that the vertices that immediately precede @xmath3 on @xmath19 and @xmath20 are in distinct components of @xmath15 split along @xmath21 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath4 be any non - separating curve on @xmath15 .",
    "then every geodesic of length @xmath22 that ends at @xmath4 can be extended to a geodesic of length @xmath23 that terminates in a dead end .",
    "indeed , there are infinitely many such extensions . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath24 is also non - separating , then any geodesic joining @xmath24 to @xmath4 has infinitely many extensions to a geodesic of length @xmath25 that has a double dead - end .",
    "every dead end in @xmath0 has depth 1 .",
    "we first encountered dead - ends when we were searching for examples of vertices @xmath2 with @xmath26 , and discovered that the only thing that was well - known was how to construct examples with @xmath27 . attempting to extend a known distance 3 example to distance 4 , we encountered a dead - end .",
    "we asked several experts whether the existence of dead - ends was known , and to our surprise they all said no . as we learned more ,",
    "however , we realized that while the phenomenon had not been recognized as such , it had indeed affected many proofs .",
    ", where we first learned about the consequences of the fact that @xmath28 is @xmath29-hyperbolic @xcite for fellow - traveller geodesics .",
    "we pondered over the statement ` if @xmath30 is non - separating ' , wondering what would go wrong if @xmath30 was separating ?",
    "this case is handled separately on page 911 .",
    "knowing about dead - ends could have made that discussion easier to understand intuitively . ]",
    "[ e : basic example ]    we give a very simple family of examples that illustrate the existence of dead - ends and double dead - ends .",
    "let @xmath31 be essential curves , with @xmath3 separating and @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 does not fill either component of @xmath1 split along @xmath3 .",
    "see the left sketch in figure  [ f : basic example ] for an example on @xmath34 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath35 for an example with @xmath36 non - separating , and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 means a dehn twist along @xmath24 , for an example with @xmath36 separating . since @xmath32 , but @xmath33 do not fill @xmath1 , the distance @xmath39 .",
    "even more , since @xmath33 do not fill _ either side _ of @xmath34 split along @xmath3 , we may find essential curves @xmath40 , one on each side of @xmath3 , giving paths @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 and @xmath44 are geodesics .",
    "suppose that a step away from @xmath3 to @xmath45 could take us a step further from @xmath4 .",
    "then both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are length 3 geodesics .",
    "since @xmath48 , @xmath49 must be in @xmath50 or @xmath51 , say @xmath50 .",
    "but then @xmath52 , which implies that @xmath53 is a path , so that @xmath54",
    ", not @xmath55 . so @xmath49 must be in @xmath56 .",
    "but then @xmath57 would be a path of length 2 and again @xmath58 .",
    "thus no such @xmath49 exists , and @xmath3 is a dead end with respect to @xmath4 .    if we choose @xmath37 , which is a separating curve , the identical argument , using the same two paths , proves that both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are dead - ends .",
    "the right sketch in figure  [ f : basic example ] shows that if the same example is modified by adding handles and punctures , the proof will go through unaltered .",
    "[ f : basic example ]    . ]",
    "we consider the proofs of ( a),(b),(c ) and ( d ) separately .",
    "* proof of ( a ) * the key observation that is needed for the proof is given in lines 8- and 7- on page 910 of @xcite : assume that @xmath3 is non - separating . choose a vertex @xmath59 such that that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 means distance under subsurface projection and where @xmath62 is the constant given in the bounded geodesic image theorem of @xcite .",
    "then , as is proved on pages 910 - 911 of @xcite , every geodesic joining @xmath4 to @xmath49 must pass through @xmath3 , i.e. there exists an extension of every geodesic joining @xmath4 to @xmath3 . by making different choices of @xmath49",
    "we obtain infinitely many such extensions for each fixed @xmath4 .",
    "* proof of ( b ) : * from the discussion regarding example  [ e : basic example ] we know that ( i ) and ( ii ) are sufficient for @xmath3 to be a dead end with respect to @xmath4 . from the proof of part ( a ) of theorem  [ t : main theorem ]",
    "we also know that ( i ) is necessary .",
    "it remains to prove that ( ii ) is necessary , i.e. if @xmath3 is separating and a dead end with respect to @xmath4 , then there always exist two geodesic paths @xmath63 with the given properties .",
    "( this is the only place in the proof of ( b ) where we need @xmath18 . )",
    "let @xmath64 be the 2 components of @xmath15 split along the dead end vertex @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that @xmath65 implies that @xmath4 and @xmath3 fill @xmath15 , therefore @xmath4 intersects both @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "assume that @xmath68 both have infinite diameter .",
    "we may choose a non - separating curve @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "lemma 2.2 of @xcite asserts that , in this situation , every geodesic joining @xmath36 to @xmath71 has a vertex , say @xmath72 , that ( regarding that vertex as a curve on a surface ) misses @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath73 . since @xmath74 , we have learned that @xmath75 .",
    "but then @xmath76 .    we wish to determine @xmath77 .",
    "observe that since @xmath78 , also @xmath74 and @xmath79 , we know that any two of the 3 vertices @xmath80 are distance 1 apart in @xmath0 . by the triangle inequality , @xmath81   but then , @xmath82 , which implies that @xmath83 .",

    "that path extends to the first sought - for geodesic path @xmath89 .",
    "now observe that if we had assumed that @xmath90 instead of @xmath74 , we could have applied the same argument to obtain a second geodesic path @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath88 and @xmath92 are separated by @xmath3 , we have constructed the required two paths , and proved ( b ) .",
    "* proof of ( c ) : * we are given a geodesic @xmath93 , which ends in the non - separating vertex @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the length two geodesics that were constructed in example  [ e : basic example ] , where ( since any two non - separating curves are equivalent under a homeomorphism of @xmath15 ) we may assume without loss of generality that the curve @xmath4 in example  [ e : basic example ] is @xmath94 .",
    "the concatenated paths @xmath95 and @xmath96 , both extend @xmath9 , but they might not be geodesics .",
    "we now consider @xmath97 , the surface @xmath15 split along the curve @xmath98 and the subsurface projection @xmath99 .",
