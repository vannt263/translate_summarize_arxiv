    "the heavy computational cost is the main reason why the bp system had been traditionally solved numerically by means of direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) methods @xcite .",
    "however , after the pioneer work @xcite , in recent years , deterministic solvers to the bp system were proposed in @xcite .",
    "these methods provide accurate results which , in general , agree well with those obtained from monte carlo ( dsmc ) simulations , often at a fractional computational time .",
    "moreover , these type of solvers can resolve transient details for the electron probability density function @xmath19 , which are difficult to compute with dsmc simulators .",
    "+ the initial methods proposed in @xcite using weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) finite difference schemes to solve the boltzmann - poisson system , had the advantage that the scheme is relatively simple to code and very stable even on coarse meshes for solutions containing sharp gradient regions . however",

    "+ the type of dg method discussed in this paper , as was done in @xcite , belongs to a class of finite element methods originally devised to solve hyperbolic conservation laws containing only first order spatial derivatives , e.g. @xcite . using a piecewise polynomial space for both the test and trial functions in the spatial variables , and coupled with explicit and nonlinearly stable high order runge - kutta time discretization ,",
