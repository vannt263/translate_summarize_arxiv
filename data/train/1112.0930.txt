    "the homogenization of @xmath1 , @xmath6 , where the limit exists , is a qusimorphism with bounded difference from @xmath1 .",
    "further @xmath7 , is a homogeneous function which means @xmath8 for every integer @xmath9 .",
    "from the point of view of the author s interest there are two main sources of study of this notion .",
    "the one that comes from the attempt to construct quasimorphisms on diffeomorphisms group , of special interest symplectomorphisms and hamiltonian groups ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . where the other source comes from the study of lie groups and , with and without relation , countable groups .",
    "so the groups studied are , for example , universal covers of hermitian lie groups and word hyperbolic groups ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite as a general reference ) . in this work",
    "we want to report a feature , which appears sometimes indirectly , which says that quasimorphisms can be obtained via `` local data '' of the group action on certain appropriate spaces .",
    "this feature appears in both families mentioned above . in a rough manner",
    "the principle says that instead of starting with a given group and try to build or study its space of quasimorphisms , we should start with a space with a certain structure , in such a way that groups acting on this space and respect this structure will automatically carry quasimorphisms , where these should be quite understood . in this paper",
    "we suggest such a family of spaces and give demonstrating examples for countable groups , groups that relates to action on the circle as well as outline construction for diffeomorphism groups , see section 3 .",
    "a distinctive advantage of this principle is that it allows the construction of the quasimorphism in a quite direct way .",
    "further , see subsection , we prove a lemma which besides serving as a platform for the construction of quasimorphisms on countable groups , bare interest by itself .",
    "since it provides us with an embedding of the countable group as a group of quasi - isometries of a universal space , where this space of embeddings is in bijection with the projective space of the homogeneous quasimorphism space of the group .",
    "we see this paper as a first step , in developing the picture that emerge from it .",
    "we should remark that the idea to look at quasimorphisms from the point of view of group action on spaces with certain , appropriate , structure has started in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the focus there was completely different .",
    "indeed the focus was on a systematic study of the relation of quasimorphisms and the notion of relative growth and order structures on groups , see @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgements : *    many thanks to danny calegari for his willingness to host me at cambridge university given a very short notice .",
    "the discussion with him was important for this work .",
    "many thanks to tobias hartnick for reading a draft of the paper and for his remarks . many thanks to andreas leiser for the help with the drawings . many thanks to leonid polterovich for his important remarks about the preliminary version .",
    "the remarks of dietmar salamon about the diffeomorphism group helped me to focus my intension and ideas i thank him very much for that .",
    "finally i am grateful to the departement mathematik of eth zrich for the support during this academic year , and in particular to paul biran and dietmar salamon .",
    "the starting point is the following simple fact that can be extracted from @xmath10 .",
    "[ basiclemma ] assume that @xmath11 is a space such that there exists a function @xmath12 and a group action @xmath13 such that for any @xmath14 we have :    @xmath15    for some universal bound b .",
    "then the function @xmath16 is a quasimorphism , where @xmath1 does not depend on the choice of @xmath17 up to a bounded error .",
    "further , if the action is effective and is not bounded in the sense that @xmath18 for some @xmath19 , then @xmath20 , the homogenization of @xmath21 is a non zero homogeneous quasimorphism .    :",
    "[ br ] actually , as it shown in @xcite every homogeneous quasimorphism can be obtained in this way by simply choosing @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be the given quasimorphism on @xmath0 .",
    "the lemma suggests a usage of the `` inverse ideology '' , meaning : start with a space @xmath24 and try to find a group action @xmath25 which satisfies condition above .",
    "the paper suggests one possible answer to this problem .",
    "we now give a setup which will lead to examples .",
    "let @xmath11 be a space with no special structure . and assume that a group @xmath26 acts on @xmath11 such that    @xmath27    where the restriction of @xmath28 above is a bijection , @xmath23 a function on @xmath11 , @xmath29 is a bounded function and , @xmath30 an unbounded homomorphism to @xmath31 .    [ triple ]",
    "we define @xmath11 , @xmath23 and @xmath32 compatible as above as a triple , and denote it by @xmath33",
    ". we do not include @xmath34 and @xmath30 in the notation since in all that follows they will not be used directly .",
    "[ maintheorem ] assume that @xmath0 acts on the space @xmath35 such that the action of @xmath0 commutes with the action of @xmath32 and , @xmath36 $ ] for all @xmath37 , and for universal constant @xmath38 , and some @xmath39 which depends on @xmath19 .",
    "for example we can choose @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath1 of lemma [ basiclemma ] defines a quasimorphism .",
    "[ ac ]    \\1 ) the assumption that @xmath32 and @xmath0 need to commute can be relaxed .",
    "instead we can demand that the groups actions will _ almost commute _ , which means that for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 we have that @xmath43 is universally bounded independently of @xmath44 .",
    "the proof goes exactly the same .",
    "\\2 ) note that due to the facts that @xmath11 is `` tiled '' by images of @xmath45 under the action of @xmath32 , and @xmath32 commutes with @xmath0 , it is enough to construct , or define , the image of @xmath45 under the restriction of the action of @xmath0 to @xmath45 .",
    "the proof is made , essentially , of three simple facts : the first thing to note is that for every @xmath46 we have that @xmath47 $ ] for some @xmath39 and the universal constant @xmath48 which bounds @xmath34 .",
    "indeed we have @xmath49 and it follows from the last axiom that @xmath50 so the claim follows since @xmath34 is bounded and of course the bounds do not depend on @xmath51 . the second thing to note",
    "is that it follows from the axioms that for all @xmath52 we have that @xmath53 is universally bounded ( actually by @xmath54 ) where we use to see it .",
    "the third thing to notice is that it follows from the assumption that @xmath55 $ ] and the fact that the actions of @xmath32 and @xmath0 commute , that for all @xmath41 we have @xmath56\\ ] ] for some @xmath39 .",
    "so now let @xmath57 .",
    "further assume that @xmath58 and @xmath59 so of course we have @xmath60 .",
    "we now estimate    @xmath61 @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    the transition from and to and comes from the second and the first properties above ( which come from and respectively ) .",
    "further , the transition to and comes from the fact that @xmath34 is globally bounded and from the third property above .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "_ from now on we set : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use the same notation and conventions as above . _",
    "we now move to the next family . using theorem with an eye to countable groups .",
    "it follows almost directly from the results of @xcite that the rademacher quasimorphism on @xmath67 fits into the scheme of theorem . here",
    "again we have @xmath68 and @xmath11 is a countable subsets of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "further , we have an action of @xmath71 on @xmath11 which almost commutes ( see remark ) with the action of @xmath67 on @xmath72 .",
    "the resulting quasimorphism , as we said , is a rademacher quasimorphism .",
    "the details are as follows , we repeat the data of @xcite in which the full details of the construction appear .",
    "recall that @xmath73 . under this isomorphism",
    "we denote by @xmath74 and @xmath75 the generators of @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . in figure [ fig2 ] below we demonstrate how the group acts on a subset , @xmath11 ( where of course only part of it appears in the figure ) , of the plane where the action is obvious from the figure . here",
    "@xmath23 increases in the horizontal direction- again see the figure .",
    "lastly , between the two dotted lines we have one fundamental domain of the action .    )",
    "example , width=240 ]      further , the following set up , culminating in the lemma below , also serve as a platform for building examples , by applying theorem .",
    "consider a discrete countable set on the open interval @xmath78 denoted by @xmath79 . and consider the `` ladder '' set @xmath80 define a metric on @xmath81 as @xmath82 where the @xmath83 are the usual induced metrics on @xmath79 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "so we have a metric space @xmath84 .",
    "lets denote by @xmath85 the projection to the @xmath31 component . finally , we denote by @xmath86 the space of all quasi - isometries of @xmath87 which respect condition where @xmath19 , in stands for quasi - isometry and @xmath5 depends on @xmath19",
    ".    now let @xmath0 be any countable group for which the space of nonzero homogenous quasimorphism is not empty .",
    "then we have :    [ qil]for a given homogeneous quasimorphism on @xmath0 , say @xmath1 , there is an injection of @xmath0 induced by @xmath1 , into @xmath86 .",
    "further , if we denote the action of the image of @xmath0 on @xmath81 , induced by @xmath1 , by @xmath88 and two representations are considered to be equivalent if the difference , with respect to @xmath23 , between the orbits of their action , for any point in @xmath81 , is universally bounded .",
    "then , there is an injection of the projective space of the homogenous quasi - morphisms space into the equivalence classes space of the representations . in other words if @xmath1 and @xmath89 are linearly independent then @xmath90 \\neq [ \\psi^{m}]$ ] , where the brackets stand for equivalence classes",
    ".    * remark . *",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize what are the lemma s main points .",
    "the space @xmath81 is quasi - isometric to @xmath71 , nevertheless the level sets of @xmath23 on @xmath81 plays a very important role in the embedding of @xmath0 above , so they can not be discarded .",
    "the lemma says that * any * quasimorphism on any countable group comes from an injection of the group into @xmath86 .",
    "it further tells us that two injections will be essentially the same if their quasimorphisms are .",
    "note that actually any group in @xmath86 , countable or not countable , for a _ fixed _",
    "constants in the quasi - isometry condition will cary a quasimorphism . by using .",
    "so it means that such a group has at least as many embeddings into @xmath86 , as the points of the projective space of its homogeneous quasimorphism space .",
    "for example : for @xmath91 for @xmath92 , being a boundedly generated group by its elementary subgroups , in which every element can be considered as a commutator , it is easily follows that for any injection of this group to @xmath86 we will have only bounded orbits .",
    "this is of course not a surprise knowing that the group has no non trivial homogeneous quasimorphisms .",
    "since @xmath1 is a nonzero homogeneous quasimorphism then we can choose a quasimorphism @xmath93 with the following properties : ( i ) the homogenization of @xmath94 , ( ii ) @xmath95,(iii ) @xmath96 and ( iv ) @xmath97 has values only in @xmath31 .",
    "for such @xmath97 denote @xmath98 which is of course countable set .",
    "in particular we have @xmath99 .",
    "now for each @xmath100 biject @xmath101 with @xmath102 . as we will see below , we can in - fact assume without loss of generality , following the countability of @xmath0 , that @xmath101 is infinite .",
    "so we now have identified @xmath0 with @xmath81 .",
    "denote by @xmath88 the bijection between @xmath0 and @xmath81 .",
    "we will denoted the left action of the group on itself by @xmath103 for the action of @xmath19 , and the induced action on @xmath81 by @xmath104 . following remark we know that @xmath97 and @xmath0 satisfy condition of lemma with some bound @xmath5 .",
    "further , by definition the left action of @xmath19 on @xmath105 for some @xmath106 is @xmath107 .    by construction we have for any @xmath108 : @xmath109    combining and ( implemented to @xmath97 and @xmath0 for the bound @xmath5 ) we get    @xmath110    now",
    "since the metric @xmath111 is bounded by 1 from @xmath112 we get @xmath113    which means that @xmath0 acts on @xmath87 via quasi - isometries .",
    "now , by simply following the construction we see that actually the image of @xmath0 is in @xmath86 .",
    "to see the second part of the lemma we observe that we can reconstruct @xmath1 from @xmath88 by choosing any point @xmath114 and simply iterate the values of @xmath23 on the induced action of the group element on the chosen point ( this can be seen transparently by following the construction ) .",
    "in particular the value does not depend on a choice of representative ( since the bounded error will vanish in the homogenization ) .",
    "summing up we have an injection as required .",
    "we now move to the next example which we give mainly for the sake of completeness of the scope of the examples . here",
    "we use theorem a bit differently , we have the following set up .",
    "assume that a set @xmath115 acts on @xmath116 ( see definition ) s.t .",
    "a ) @xmath117 , @xmath118 b ) elements of @xmath0 preserve the level sets of @xmath23.c ) the error function @xmath34 equals zero .",
    "then ,    under the above assumptions [ arot]@xmath0 is a group .",
    "the action of @xmath0 on the triple satisfies all the condition of theorem so lemma applied to this case gives that @xmath21 is a quasimorphism on @xmath0 .",
    "further for the case @xmath119 , @xmath1 comes from an action on the circle .",
    "we first remark , that it is very simple to define @xmath115 such that all the assumptions are kept but the preservation of the level sets of @xmath23 , and @xmath0 will not be group .",
    "this being said , once we add the assumption then trivially we have that @xmath0 is a group .",
    "still , in order to use theorem we must show that for all @xmath120 we have @xmath121 $ ] for some @xmath39 , which depends on @xmath19 , and @xmath122 which is not .",
    "the proof for @xmath123 and the general case is the same so we will give a proof for @xmath123 .",
    "we will see that @xmath124 .",
    "we first recall that any element of @xmath0 is monotone with respect to @xmath23 in the sense above .",
    "let us denote @xmath125 for some @xmath126 and some @xmath127 .",
    "so we need to show that @xmath128\\ ] ] assume not , let @xmath129 be such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "write the k - action of @xmath132 . ]",
    "@xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "we claim that @xmath34 is not covered by @xmath135 .",
    "if so , let @xmath136 such that @xmath137 applying @xmath138 both sides we get @xmath139 which means ( recall that @xmath19 is a bijection ) @xmath140 is the pre - image of @xmath141 .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath34 is not covered by @xmath142 .",
    "so @xmath34 must be covered by @xmath143 .",
    "on the other hand @xmath144 .",
    "this means that there is an element say @xmath145 in @xmath146 such that @xmath147 . but",
    "@xmath145 came from @xmath142 , while @xmath34 is covered from @xmath143 .",
    "this contradicts the monotonicity of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "thus is proved , which is the main condition of theorem .    to show that our quasimorphism comes from an action on the circle we argue in a standard way .",
    "let us denote by @xmath148 and define the subset @xmath149 .",
    "since @xmath0 preserve the level sets there is an induced action of @xmath0 on @xmath150 , and further since , by assumption the bounded error function @xmath34 is zero it follows that there is a translation action of @xmath31 action .",
    "lastly the action of @xmath0 on @xmath151 is monotone .",
    "it is a standard fact that such an action extends to the whole real line .",
    "we thus get that the image of @xmath0 is in @xmath152 , the group of monotone orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the real line . now noting that the constructed homogeneous quasimorphism comes from iterating the values of @xmath153 with respect to the action of the group element we get that this is exactly the translation number defined on @xmath152 , in particular the quasimorphism comes",
    "form an action on the circle .",
    "we would like to state the following remarks relating to subsequent research and diffeomorphism groups .",
    "assume @xmath154 is a smooth @xmath145 manifold , path connected , unbounded . in particular , carries an induced riemannian metric , so we have a notion of length of paths , and volume on @xmath11 .",
    "assume also that the closure of @xmath155 intersect only the closure of @xmath156 and @xmath157 and the action of @xmath31 on @xmath11 is via isometries ( recall that the action of @xmath9 , @xmath158 , satisfies that @xmath159 ) .",
    "further we choose @xmath160 to be an open submanifold of @xmath142 which exhaust the ( finite ) volume of @xmath142 up to a given constant and has the same ( finite ) diameter as @xmath142 .",
    "finally , choose @xmath160 such that it has a smooth boundary .          for example",
    ": @xmath167 can be taken to be periodic with respect to the @xmath168 so the elements of @xmath169 respect the period up to some error where the simplest example is when @xmath170 is just a constant function .",
    "we define @xmath70 as follows : we choose a reference point @xmath171 and define @xmath172 where @xmath173 is length element of the metric and the sign is determined to be compatible with the labeling of the fundamental domains . for `` simple enough '' fundamental domain @xmath142",
    "such an @xmath23 will make @xmath174 into a triple in the sense of",
    ". finally , note that the set of groups contained in @xmath169 which satisfy the above conditions is not empty , since the translations group is such a group .",
    "even further in some cases , as we saw in example 1 of the previous section , we have a family of such groups .",
    "thus by zorn s lemma we have at least one maximal group @xmath0 with the conditions above .",
    "for such @xmath0 we have :    for all @xmath175 we have @xmath176 $ ] where @xmath38 depends only on @xmath23 and @xmath177 and we iterate only the points of @xmath160 .",
    "thus the formula @xmath178 defines a quasimorphism on @xmath0 and @xmath179 the homogenization of @xmath1 a non zero homogeneous quasimorphism on @xmath0 .",
    "* 2 . * the basic picture that stems from lemma",
    ", according to @xcite , seems to relate to @xcite where the results there seem to relate to at least one aspect of implications of the lemma . in @xcite , quasimorphisms are indeed studied on finitely presented groups via , more or less , quasi - isometric action on trees .",
    "it seems that by using lemma as a starting point , and results of @xcite , new interpretation to @xcite can be given .",
    "an important point is that this work can also be used to study similar ideas where we consider countable groups into diffeomorphism groups using quasi isometries as carriers of data on quasimorphisms on the groups .",
