    "the use of idempotents in the construction of cyclic error correcting codes is well established and the resulting literature is extensive ( for example , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the basic building blocks for this theory are the primitive idempotents .",
    "any cyclic code may be described by a unique idempotent and this idempotent is a sum of primitive idempotents . for binary cyclic codes ,",
    "efficient algorithms exist for the calculation of these primitive idempotents .",
    "another way of constructing idempotents in the binary case is by using cyclotomic cosets and it was this property which was exploited by shibuya and sakaniwa in @xcite .",
    "their goal was to use idempotents to construct parity check matrices for ldpc codes which have no cycles of length 4 in their factor graphs . at the heart of their technique",
    "is a lemma which is a variation of a result used by weldon @xcite , for the construction of difference set cyclic codes . using this lemma and a subsequent theorem",
    ", they were able to simplify the problem of determining which of the idempotents that are constructed , using a single cyclotomic coset , do not have cycles of length 4 .",
    "they then extended this theory to more general idempotents .",
    "this approach to the construction of ldpc codes has the great advantage of simplicity , the parity check matrices depend only upon the correct choice of cyclotomic cosets and these are very easily calculated .",
    "however , we believe that this advantage is offset by some fundamental weaknesses .    whilst the absence of 4 cycles is a desirable objective in the construction of ldpc codes it is not mandatory @xcite , since there are some good codes which do not have this property .",
    "an example of such a code is included in this paper .",
    "the code rate is also an important property of codes but , as shibuya and sakaniwa admit in their conclusion , the codes which they construct in this way are _ expected _ to have a large minimum distance _ at the expense of rate_(our italics ) .",
    "the minimum distance of a code is a crucial property but there is no indication in @xcite of how either a single cyclotomic coset , or combinations of more than one cyclotomic cosets , should be chosen to guarantee that the code constructed has a large minimum distance .    in order to address the question of how to choose idempotents which will produce good ldpc codes we propose an entirely different route . as in @xcite",
    ", we shall deal exclusively with binary cyclic codes . making effective use of the mattson - solomon polynomial",
    ", we produce an algorithm which not only allows us to choose , in a systematic way , idempotents with low weight , and therefore a correspondingly sparse parity check matrix , but also with the desirable features that the corresponding codes have a high code rate and a large minimum distance .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in",
    "we shall review the necessary theory and explain how it will be used to provide an algorithm for the determination of idempotents which may be used to construct good codes . in the design and implementation of this algorithm",
    "is given and then , in , some of the results are displayed . finally , in , we draw our conclusions on this approach .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be a positive integer and @xmath2 be the splitting field for @xmath3 over @xmath4 . let @xmath5 be a primitive @xmath1th root of unity and let @xmath6 be the polynomials in @xmath7 $ ] of degree @xmath8 . if @xmath9 then the map @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11(z)=\\sum_{j=1}^na(\\alpha^j)z^{n - j}\\]]and @xmath12 is the mattson - solomon polynomial of @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( we use @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the polynomial variables to distinguish between the polynomials in the domain and codomain of @xmath16 . )",
    "if @xmath17 is multiplication of polynomials@xmath18 and @xmath19 is defined on @xmath20 by the rule @xmath21 then it is well known @xcite,@xcite , that @xmath22 is an isomorphism of rings , in particular it is an isomorphism of the additive groups .",
    "if @xmath23 is the subset of @xmath6 consisting of polynomials with coefficients in @xmath24 ( binary polynomials ) and @xmath25 is the subset of @xmath6 consisting of idempotents , both of these subsets are _ additive subgroups _ of @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to show ( see @xcite ) that @xmath26are both isomorphisms and from this it is obvious that @xmath27is also an isomorphism .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 is a binary idempotent which is used to construct a parity check matrix for a cyclic code .",
    "the parity check matrix is constructed from the @xmath1-cyclic shifts of @xmath28 @xcite , and so for the resulting code to be a ldpc code , @xmath28 must have low weight .    if @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then @xmath31 is the generator of the cyclic code .",
    "if the generator , @xmath31 , has degree @xmath32 , the dimension of the code is @xmath33 and the larger the value of @xmath33 , the better the code rate .",
    "since @xmath31 is a divisor of @xmath3 , all of the zeros of @xmath31 are @xmath1th roots of unity , and there are @xmath32 of these .",
    "further , gcd@xmath34=1 and @xmath35 , so that the number of distinct @xmath1th roots of unity which are also roots of @xmath28 is @xmath33 .",
    "the dimension of the code is therefore the number of @xmath1th roots of unity which are also roots of @xmath28 .",
    "the bch bound of the code is determined by the number of consecutive powers of @xmath36 , taken cyclically ( mod@xmath37 ) , which are also roots of @xmath31 . for the reasons outlined in the previous paragraph ,",
    "this is precisely the same as the number of consecutive powers of @xmath36 , taken cyclically ( mod@xmath37 ) , which are _ not _ roots of @xmath28 .",
    "the important features of the code are therefore determined by :    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     take @xmath38 and let @xmath39 be its ms polynomial .",
    "the inverse mapping    @xmath40    is defined as follows : if @xmath41(z)$ ] is the mattson - solomon polynomial of the polynomial @xmath42 then , for @xmath43 @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath45 and let @xmath46 .",
    "the three key properties relating to the idempotent @xmath28 , listed above , are easily gleaned from its mattson - solomon polynomial @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , as follows :      the weight of @xmath28 is the number of @xmath1th roots of unity which are zeros of @xmath48 . to see this note that @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 , since idempotents take only the values @xmath52 and @xmath53 in @xmath54 .",
    "now @xmath55 and the coefficients of @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 ( _ cf _ equation ( [ inverse ] ) ) .",
    "thus @xmath58 precisely when @xmath50 , giving the weight of @xmath28 as the degree of the polynomial @xmath48 .      from the definition of the ms polynomial , ( [ ms ] ) ,",
    "@xmath59 and the number of zeros of @xmath28 which are roots of unity is clearly @xmath60 .",
    "the bch bound of the code is the largest number of consecutive powers of @xmath36 which are _ not _ roots of @xmath28 , i.e. the number of consecutive @xmath61 , taken ( mod@xmath37 ) , such that @xmath62 . from ( [ theta ] ) , this is the largest number of consecutive non - zero coefficients in @xmath63 , taken cyclically ( mod @xmath1 ) .    using this information , a systematic search for idempotents",
    "can now be made in increasing order of weight , with accompanying knowledge of the number of roots which are @xmath1th roots of unity and the corresponding bch bound .",
    "this algorithm is constructed in the mattson - solomon domain .",
    "let the decomposition of @xmath64 into irreducible ( over @xmath0 ) polynomials be @xmath65 . for @xmath66 let @xmath67 and let @xmath68 be the associated primitive idempotent ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "these are displayed below in an array , together with other idempotents :    @xmath69    here @xmath70 are the idempotents whose mattson - solomon polynomials are @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath72 and let @xmath73 and @xmath74 be defined as @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . from the properties of primitive idempotents ,",
    "if @xmath45 then it follows that gcd@xmath78 and @xmath79 the idempotent @xmath80 will now have the following properties .",
    "@xmath81 the bch bound is determined from @xmath82 as explained in [ bch - bound ] .    since methods for finding the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are well documented ( see e.g. @xcite ) a search algorithm can be built around this observation to find a suitable weight idempotent with a known number of zeros and a known bch bound .",
    "the rows of the array ( [ array1 ] ) , are ordered by the degree of the polynomials , i.e. @xmath85 for all @xmath61 , and a search can be made in increasing order of weight .",
    "when a successful outcome has been obtained , _ only at this stage _ is the _ inverse fourier transform _ ( ms@xmath86 ) evaluated to find the corresponding idempotent .",
    "all of the information which is required will already be known .",
    "if @xmath87 denotes the number of cyclotomic cosets modulo @xmath1 , the complexity of an exhaustive search algorithm is @xmath88 .",
    "we reduce this search complexity by targeting the search on the three key parameters :      in @xcite , weldon introduced difference - set cyclic codes .",
    "these codes have the desirable property that the parity check equations are orthogonal on all bits and have no cycles of length 4 in their factor graphs . a necessary condition for this",
    "is that if @xmath89 is the polynomial which generates the parity check matrix then the weight of @xmath89 must satisfy the inequality @xmath90where @xmath1 is the code length . since the weights of the idempotents @xmath28 are related to the degrees of the @xmath84 by ( [ eqn : wt - of - u ] ) , a reasonable bound is    @xmath91    in practice we have gone a little beyond this limit and this has enabled us to find some good codes which do have cycles of length 4 in their factor graph .",
    "the code - rate is directly proportional to the number of roots of @xmath28 .",
    "if we let @xmath92 represent our minimum desired code - rate then , following equation  ( [ eqn : zeros - of - u ] ) , we can refine our search bound to @xmath93      let @xmath94 be the lowest desired minimum distance and let @xmath95 be the largest number of consecutive non - zero coefficients , taken cyclically @xmath96 , of @xmath63 .",
    "then , following the discussion of [ bch - bound ] , we restrict our search algorithm to those @xmath63 for which    @xmath97    we develop an efficient , but exhaustive recursive tree - search based on the above bounds .",
    "the developed search algorithm , algorithm  [ alg : search ] , is initialised by setting @xmath98 and @xmath99 to @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .    @xmath102 minimum code - rate of interest + @xmath103 lowest expected minimum distance + @xmath104 small positive integer + @xmath105 @xmath106 sorted in ascending order of the degree + @xmath107 @xmath106 @xmath108 contains set of codes @xmath109 @xmath110 append @xmath61 to @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 a cyclic code defined by @xmath28 add @xmath115 to @xmath116 codesearch(@xmath111 , @xmath99 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) @xmath119",
    "since the algorithm is an exhaustive search , the code construction method presented in this paper is able to produce , in addition to new codes , many well - know cyclic codes , for example the difference - set cyclic codes and the euclidean and projective geometry codes .",
    "some of the new codes which we have found using this technique are presented in table  [ tbl : code - examples ] .",
