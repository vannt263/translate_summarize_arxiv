    "observations of lithium absorption in brown dwarfs has lead to a precise age measurement for the pleiades of 120 myr @xcite , a result which has interesting implications for the dynamical state of the cluster as well as stellar astrophysics .    despite a rich history of vigorous research in the pleiades",

    "our primary goal is to characterize the fundamental structure of the pleiades and estimate the mass function below 0.5 m@xmath3 to the completeness of the poss @xmath11 plates , roughly 0.1 m@xmath3 for cluster members .",

    "the correlation with 2mass and the five band detection requirement ensures that the database contains few spurious sources .",
    "even in proper motion space the large area of this pleiades search introduces a substantial amount of field star contamination . to reduce this contamination ,",
    "a broad color filter selected only sources with colors similar to known pleiades members .",
    "we chose to include sources in the range @xmath30 based on the dynamic range of the pmm extractions at the bright end and by the sensitivity of the poss plates at the faint end .",

    "due to the large number of field stars in the region , we found fitting the distribution functions in small magnitude groups difficult , particularly for faint stars .",

    "membership probabilities for the @xmath46 sources fainter than about @xmath32 are much less reliable than those for the the relatively brighter stars for two reasons .",
    "first , degradation in the pmm astrometry at faint magnitudes causes a larger dispersion in proper motion space , which makes modelling their distribution difficult .",
    "the faint clusters members are dispersed to smaller membership probabilities than relatively brighter cluster members .",
    "second , field contamination increases at faint magnitudes .",
    "membership of candidates fainter than about @xmath47 will thus rely more heavily on their spectral properties .",
    "the large area covered by this work results in enough field contamination to numerically dilute the membership probabilities .",

    "the spatial distribution of sources with membership probability depicted in figure [ fig : plpos4 ] demonstrates qualitative statistical consistency of proper motion membership probability with true association with the cluster .",
    "in order to determine the success of the proper motion search , and estimate the field star contamination in our sample , we obtained optical spectra for a large number of our pleiades candidates .",
    "m dwarf members of the pleiades exhibit strong chromospheric activity @xcite , detectable through resulting h@xmath4 emission , while field m dwarfs are usually less active @xcite . therefore ,",

    "the observations included 121 control targets with colors similar to the pleiades candidates but that were expected to be field stars based on having proper motion farther than 3 @xmath45/cent .",
    "from the cluster centroid in the vpd .",
    "we used standard ccd reductions and analysis routines in iraf , and susequently measured the equivalent width of h@xmath4 line ( @xmath51 ) from each one - dimensional spectrum using the fitprofs routine over a spectral region of @xmath52  .",

    "a @xmath53 test suggests there is less than @xmath54 probability that the candidate sample and the control sample are derived from the same distribution function",
    ". however , about 75 pleiades candidates in the spectroscopic sample do not show strong h@xmath4 emission , indicating that a fraction of our overall sample contains field stars .",
    "in total , this pleiades search has identified 4233 possible pleiades members with @xmath55",
    ". most will actually be non - members at large radial distances .",

    "table [ tab : hstats ] shows the statistical dependence of @xmath51 with respect to proper motion membership probability , @xmath34 magnitude , and radial distance .",
    "as expected , the contamination is worst at large radial distance and at faint magnitudes . for sources with @xmath55 in the magnitude range @xmath58 within @xmath59 of the cluster center",
    ", we estimate the overall contamination to be about 13% .",
    "the lower surface density of field stars at relatively brighter magnitudes implies a lower contamination level for brighter stars . outside a @xmath59 radius",
    ", we expect the contamination to dominate the sample , but can not yet quantify it without individual membership information obtained , for example , from radial velocity measurements .",
    "the sample of 121 field stars contained 104 m dwarfs that had spectral types similar to the pleiades candidates , m2  m6 @xcite . among these 104 objects ,",
    "29 had @xmath60  , and 18 had @xmath61  . assuming that stars with @xmath60  are indeed dme stars , the 28% dme rate in the m2 ",
    "m6 range agrees well with the data given in @xcite , although the pleiades field sample is too small to determine the dme fraction as a function of spectral type .",
    "thus , from the 70 pleiades candidates in the range m2  m6 that we assume are not members ( @xmath62  ) , we can estimate roughly 27 dme stars in the sample of 434 with @xmath60  , or 6% dme contamination .",
    "the dynamic range of the pmm extractions limits the completeness at the bright end of this search .",
    "counts for sources with correlated @xmath63 detections indicate that the pmm detections are complete up to @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath2 1.5 m@xmath3 for pleiades members .",
    "since our primary goal is to detect low mass stars , incompleteness at the bright end of our sample should not pose a significant problem due to the large amount of published data for bright pleiades members .",
    "this work recovered over 92% of the hhj sample including several of their faintest objects , such as hhj 3 and hhj 2 ( albeit at relatively low membership probability ) , indicating that it is relatively complete to @xmath65 .",
    "this work has also discovered about 269 candidates with @xmath56 that were in the hhj survey area but not in their list .",
    "spectra for 109 of these candidates show that 83% have @xmath51 consistent with cluster membership ( 3  14  ) , while 94% of hhj stars in our list have @xmath51 consistent with cluster membership .",
    "thus , while our study appears to be more complete than hhj , it is also more contaminated . if 83% of the 269 new objects in the hhj and region and sensitivity range are in fact pleiades members , then the hhj survey is 66% complete relative to a projected total of 663 objects , in good agreement with their completeness estimation of 70% through most of their sensitivity range .",
    "this search also recovered 8 objects from the survey of @xcite , including cfht - pl-5 and cfht - pl-10 , 3 ppl objects from @xcite including ppl 13 , and no objects from @xcite .",
    "thus it is very incomplete at the hydrogen burning limit , @xmath66 @xcite , and below .      in order to construct a `` complete '' pleaides catalog containing faint stars from this work and brighter stars from previous work , we merged our list of pleiades candidates with probable members contained in the cfa open cluster database , derived primarily from hii , sk , hcg , and hhj",

    "stars with masses less than 1 m@xmath3 have similar radial extent , implying tidal truncation affects stars with mass up to @xmath6 m@xmath3 .",
    "this result indicates that relatively bright stars up to @xmath85 can be used to trace escape processes around the cluster using upcoming high precision , space - based astrometry missions such as fame @xcite or sim @xcite , which , according to specifications , should constrain nearly the entire phase space for detected stars in nearby clusters such as the pleiades .",

    "the slightly flatter mass function in the pleiades core suggests a marginal detection of preferential depletion of low mass objects at the center of the cluster .",

    "the approximate limiting tidal radius @xmath116 for a member star along the direction towards or away from the galactic center depends on the cluster mass @xmath117 and the galactic rotation curve @xcite : @xmath118^\\frac{1}{3}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the oort constants .",
    "the values @xmath121 km s@xmath122 kpc@xmath122 and @xmath123 km s@xmath122 kpc@xmath122 @xcite correspond to a tidal radius of 13.1 pc , which confirms earlier results found by @xcite using several different pleiades catalogs and an expression for the tidal radius of a cluster in radial orbit @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spatial ] displays a projection of this radius . the tidal radius overlaps with the confidence interval for the `` edge '' of the cluster determined from the king profile fit ( figure [ fig : fsall ] ) .",
    "therefore , the limited size of the pleiades indicates the absence of a massive population of brown dwarfs or internal dark matter .",
    "thus we conclude that the stellar mass composes nearly the entire dynamical mass .",
    "further comparison of @xmath116 given above with the king tidal radius @xmath124 is dangerous as they represent different quantities in this case , since the direction of @xmath116 lies along the line of sight .",
    "@xmath5 body models predict an elongation of open clusters in roughly the @xmath80-direction and to a slightly lesser extent in the @xmath125-direction , due to heating in the halo by the galactic tidal field @xcite .",
    "the tidal field in these models , generated from a circular cluster orbit in the galactic plane , produces a nonspherical tidal surface resulting in a flattened structure with axial ratios 2:1.4:1 in the @xmath80:@xmath125:@xmath126 directions , respectively @xcite .",
    "terlevich predicts a fairly constant number of stars trapped in the halo , between 1 and 2 tidal radii , for some period of time before escaping permanently .",
    "portegies zwart maps escaping stars exiting primarily through the first and second lagrangian points .    at @xmath81 and @xmath127 ,",
    "the projection of the pleiades onto the sky is most sensitive to structure in the @xmath128 plane .",
    "following @xcite , we used moment analysis to determine the ellipticity @xmath129 of the pleiades .",
    "this method allows direct , quantitative comparison of the pleiades to a simulated cluster .",
    "figure [ fig : e ] shows measurements of @xmath130 within a given radius @xmath131 for pleiades stars with mass 1  0.1 m@xmath3 , with propagation of poisson uncertainties determining the error bars .",
    "field contamination dilutes the measured ellipticity , especially near and beyond the tidal radius at @xmath132 . for comparison ,",
    "figure [ fig : e ] also shows the ellipticity of portegies zwart s @xcite models w4-iiii and w6-iiii at an age of 100 myr .",
    "the w4 and w6 simulated clusters orbit at 6 kpc and 12 kpc , respectively , from the galactic center . to compare their ellipticities with the pleiades , we projected the positions of stars with mass 1  0.1 m@xmath3 to the location and size of the pleiades on the sky , assuming binaries are unresolved .",
    "the models show similarity to the flattened structure throughout most of the pleiades halo .",
    "the moment analysis confirms elongation in both the pleiades and the models lies nearly parallel the galactic plane ; the major axes of the halos of the pleiades and models lie consistently within @xmath0 of the longitude of the cluster",
    ". however , the orientation of the ellipticity in the core of the pleiades deviates more randomly from the halo by as much as @xmath133 , suggesting the higher ellipticity in the pleiades core seen in figure [ fig : e ] is probably due to coincidental projection effects rather than a consistent elliptical distribution , and thus is not physically significant .",
    "clearly , better membership information is required for the outermost pleiades stars . however , the models appear to adequately describe a young , but dynamically evolved , open cluster such as the pleiades .",
    "the pleiades cluster has interacted with local environmental features not specifically included in the models .",
    "for example , the pleiades probably migrated from the sagittarius arm @xcite .",
    "however , this would have occurred more than one relaxation time interval ( @xmath134 myr ) in the past , so the cluster , through evolution , has likely `` forgotten '' any effects from its passage out of the arm .",
    "recent observations of interstellar gas in the vicinity of the pleiades suggests that the cluster is coincidentally colliding with two small molecular clouds ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) moving , relative to the pleiades , at @xmath2 15  20 km / s .",
    "however , the mass of the gas is only 20  50 m@xmath3 @xcite , which is much smaller than the mass of the cluster stars .",
    "thus , comparison of the pleiades with models is legitimate since local features have had negligible effects on its present structure .",
    "the poisson statistics of the background stars in figure [ fig : spatial ] place an upper limit of @xmath135 stars deg@xmath136 that may have escaped the pleiades in the projected @xmath128 plane . without individual distance measurements , projection of the @xmath80 direction along the line of sight prevents our probing the proposed escape mechanism near the lagrangian points .",
    "since the galactic tidal field is the primary catalyst for dispersal , a future measurement of the escape mechanism combined with structure and kinematic data in open clusters of various dynamical ages will better test our understanding of the nature of the tidal field .",
    "for example , substantial flattening has also been found in the hyades @xcite and alpha persei @xcite .",
    "however , other clusters , such as praesepe @xcite and m67 @xcite , show less flattening .",
    "better membership surveys are required in most clusters to study any dependence of structure on age or environmental effects .",
    "a comparison of the static tidal model results to those of more realistic simulations that include time dependent tidal fields from radial oscillation and vertical disk passage ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be a useful exercise to closely examine when the static approximation to the tidal field breaks down in clusters older than the pleiades .",
    "this paper described a wide field proper motion search using 2mass and pmm astrometry , which has detected @xmath2 1200 high probability , low mass pleiades candidates , down to a mass @xmath2 0.1 m@xmath3 , from nearly 1 million stars in a 300 deg@xmath137 field around the nominal center of the cluster .",
    "several hundred are newly detected candidates .",
    "spectroscopic results for 528 pleiades candidates show a slight degree of contamination for high probability candidates to a radial distance of @xmath2 5@xmath50 . beyond this distance , nearly all objects detected as pleiades candidates are expected to be field stars .",
    "the high mass cluster members are centrally concentrated with respect to low mass members .",
    "tidal truncation is relevant to all objects with mass less than @xmath6 m@xmath3 .",
    "the mass function in the range 1  0.1 m@xmath3 is marginally flatter within the core than outside , indicating evidence for preferential escape of stars with less than average mass .",
    "these results agree with theoretical and numerical expectations .",
    "the pleiades mass function rises slowly below 1 m@xmath3 and appears to become flat at 0.1 m@xmath3 , suggesting a lower limit of @xmath2 200 brown dwarfs in the cluster .",
    "this result is consistent with previous surveys that conclude brown dwarfs contribute little to the dynamical mass .",
    "stars with mass 1  0.1 m@xmath3 dominate the total mass .",
    "better membership information , near and beyond the tidal radius , is needed to determine whether the pleiades mass function represents the initial mass function , or reflects preferential evaporation of low mass objects .",
    "the total pleiades stellar mass is @xmath2 800 m@xmath3 , including a 15% correction for unresolved binaries .",
    "the corresponding tidal radius to this mass estimate is approximately 13.1 pc .",
    "the apparent size of the pleiades rules out a significant addition to this mass estimate from brown dwarfs or dark matter .    the cluster is highly flattened in the @xmath128 plane , in good agreement with recent numerical models .",
    "this result confirms that the galactic tidal field plays the dominant role in open cluster dispersal .",
    "detection of the escape mechanism and dispersal rate will likely rely on future high precision , space - based astrometry .",
