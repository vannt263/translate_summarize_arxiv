    "<S> research in the field of low - temperature electronics is limited by the small number of electrical contacts available on cryogenic set ups . </S>",
    "<S> this not only restricts the number of devices that can be fabricated , but also the device and circuit complexity . </S>",
    "<S> we present an on - chip multiplexing technique which significantly increases the number of devices locally measurable on a single chip , without the modification of existing fabrication or experimental set - ups . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the operation of the multiplexer by performing electrical measurements of 256 quantum wires formed by split - gate devices using only 19 electrical contacts on a cryogenic set - up . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplexer allows the measurement of many devices and enables us to perform statistical analyses of various electrical features which exist in quantum wires . </S>",
    "<S> we use this architecture to investigate spatial variations of electrical characteristics , and reproducibility on two separate cooldowns . </S>",
    "<S> these statistical analyses are necessary to study device yield and manufacturability , in order for such devices to form the building blocks for the realisation of quantum integrated circuits . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplexer provides a scalable architecture which makes a whole series of further investigations into more complex devices possible .    </S>",
    "<S> email : ha322@cam.ac.uk , lws22@cam.ac.uk + cryogenic experimental set ups limit the complexity of low - temperature electronics by the small number of electrical wires available on a cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> this also restricts the number of devices that can be fabricated on a single chip , and multiple cooldowns of many samples are necessary for electrical characterisation of devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not only is this extremely time consuming and costly , but variations between cooldowns may lead to misleading characterisation of electrical features due to changes in the electron density .    for devices to be considered for applications in spintronics  @xcite or quantum information processing  @xcite , one must consider reliability , yield and manufacturability / reproducibility . </S>",
    "<S> one device which has been identified as having great potential in these applications  @xcite is the split - gate transistor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the split gate is an ideal component to investigate because it can be seen as a building block for more complex devices ( such as laterally - defined quantum dots ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also the simplest device to exhibit quantum phenomena ; the quantisation of conductance in units of @xmath0 as electrons become confined in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) channel  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we presented the first study of a large number of individually - addressable , gate - defined quantum devices on a gaas / algaas heterostructure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> separate measurement of each device was enabled using an on - chip increase in number of electrical contacts : a quantum multiplexer . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplexer addresses an array of 256 geometrically - identical split gates . since </S>",
    "<S> many devices can be measured during a single cooldown in a cryostat , a study of the fabrication and quantum yield can be performed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , statistical variations in quantum phenomena can be investigated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this present study is the reproducibility of electrical characteristics , both from device - to - device and after thermal cycling .    </S>",
    "<S> devices were fabricated on a modulation - doped gaas / algaas heterostructure , in which the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) forms @xmath1 nm below the surface of the wafer . </S>",
    "<S> data are presented before and after illumination with a light emitting diode . the carrier density ( @xmath2 ) and mobility ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> were measured to be @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7v@xmath8s@xmath8 , respectively , before illumination . </S>",
    "<S> after illumination , @xmath9 @xmath5 and @xmath10 @xmath7v@xmath8s@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> standard optical lithography was used to define the surface gates , and the split gates ( @xmath11 @xmath3 m long and @xmath11 @xmath3 m wide ) , were patterned using electron - beam lithography . </S>",
    "<S> two - terminal lock - in measurements were performed at 1.4 k using excitation voltages between 25 and 100 @xmath3v at 77 hz .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) schematic diagram of a two - way quantum multiplexer . the mesa ( blue ) branches from input contact @xmath12 to eight separate output paths , labelled 1 - 8 . </S>",
    "<S> addressing gates are shown in yellow ( off ) and white ( on ) , and insulating regions are shown in grey . </S>",
    "<S> negative voltages applied to addressing gates @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 route the input voltage along the path indicated by the arrow , to output 1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) optical micrograph of the device , consisting of two multiplexers addressing an array of 256 split gates . </S>",
    "<S> the contacts for the source , drain and input - voltage are labelled s , d and v , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig1](a ) illustrates the operation of the multiplexer . a raised ` mesa ' which confines the 2deg branches from the contact labelled @xmath12 , to which an input voltage ( @xmath18 ) is applied . the output path through the multiplexer </S>",
    "<S> is determined by 6 ` addressing gates ' ( @xmath19 to @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these gates cover multiple mesa - defined branches of the multiplexer ; in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) gate @xmath14 crosses the mesa at points @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . a photo - definable insulator ( polyimide hd4104 ) , is located underneath the addressing gates at selected locations , for example at @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a negative voltage applied to @xmath14 is sufficient to deplete the 2deg at @xmath20 and @xmath22 , but not @xmath21 . to direct @xmath18 along path 1 ( as illustrated by the arrow ) , </S>",
    "<S> only gates @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are ` on ' , i.e. a negative voltage is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 can be directed to any of the other output paths depending on which addressing gates are ` on ' or ` off ' . </S>",
    "<S> a voltage offset ( @xmath24 ) must be maintained between @xmath23 and the addressing gates that are ` on ' , where @xmath24 is the voltage which must be applied to each addressing gate to deplete electrons in the 2deg when @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> addressing gates which are ` off ' are held at the same voltage as @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](b ) shows an optical micrograph of the chip , in which the source , drain , and contact to which the split - gate voltage ( @xmath16 ) is applied are labelled s , d , and v , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the split gates are arranged in a rectangular array , and each device is measured individually , using two multiplexers ( the left multiplexer selects the row , and the top multiplexer selects the column ) . </S>",
    "<S> the operation of the chip is described more fully in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    as a proof - of - concept , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) shows a schematic diagram of a three - way multiplexer , which gives a 50@xmath26 increase in the number of output paths while maintaining the same number of electrical contacts ( i.e. 6 addressing gates and 1 input contact ) . </S>",
    "<S> the operation is identical to the two - way multiplexer except that if the desired path is through either outer mesa channels @xmath27 or @xmath28 , the voltage applied to addressing gates @xmath13 or @xmath19 must be large enough to deplete the 2deg beneath the insulator at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the required path is through the central channel ( @xmath29 ) , a voltage is applied to both @xmath19 and @xmath13 such that the 2deg is depleted at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but not at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a scalable architecture that can be extended to address an even larger number of devices on chip . </S>",
    "<S> the number of output paths from the two - way ( @xmath30 ) and three - way ( @xmath31 ) multiplexers are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , where @xmath2 is the number of electrical contacts ( including the addressing gates and input contact ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) histogram of @xmath36 before illumination , for a bin size of @xmath37 mv . </S>",
    "<S> the data are categorised according to whether disorder effects were or were not evident , represented by shaded and solid bars , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the conductance ( @xmath38 ) through each split gate was measured individually , as a function of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> due to damage that occurred during fabrication , fifteen split gates did not define a 1d channel , leaving 241 usable devices . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a yield of @xmath39 , which may be improved with careful manufacture . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](d ) shows conductance @xmath38 as a function of @xmath16 for an example split gate ( before illumination ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pinch - off voltage ( @xmath36 ) is defined as the voltage at which @xmath40 , marked by the arrow .    figures  [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) show colour - scale plots of @xmath17 as a function of spatial distribution before and after illumination , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 is normalised to the mean pinch - off voltage [ @xmath41 , and the range of the colour bars in ( a ) and ( b ) are identical , to allow direct comparison . </S>",
    "<S> each box represents a split gate in the array , and clear boxes indicate the 15 split gates where @xmath36 could not be determined . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) it can be seen that the normalised variation of @xmath17 reduces after illumination . </S>",
    "<S> prior to illumination @xmath42 v , and standard deviation @xmath43 mv . following illumination , @xmath44 v ( due to the increased @xmath2 ) , and the absolute value of @xmath45 increased to @xmath46 mv </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a reduction in the coefficient of variation ( defined as a dimensionless ratio of the standard deviation to the absolute of the mean ) , from 0.127 to 0.054 , such that a higher @xmath2 appears to lead to greater uniformity of @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum phenomena in mesoscopic devices can be affected by disorder . </S>",
    "<S> two main sources of disorder in gaas hemts are scattering from ionised donors and ionised impurities . in 1d measurements </S>",
    "<S> , this can lead to deviations in the quantised conductance from @xmath47 , weakened or missing plateaux , and evidence of coulomb blockade  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](c ) shows a histogram of @xmath36 ( before illumination ) , for a bin size of @xmath37 mv . </S>",
    "<S> the data are categorised according to whether disorder effects were observed at any point on the conductance trace . before illumination </S>",
    "<S> , 70 ( 171 ) devices did not ( did ) show evidence of disorder ( in this measurement @xmath48 k , at a lower @xmath49 more disorder effects may become apparent ) . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath17 is smaller where disorder was not observed ( @xmath50 v ) , and the standard deviation @xmath51 mv compared to @xmath52 mv . </S>",
    "<S> the total distribution in fig .  [ fig2](c ) is perhaps bi - modal , for which an explanation has yet to be determined .    </S>",
    "<S> certain disorder effects ( such as missing or weakened plateau ) , were much less evident after illumination , since the higher electron density results in better screening of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> however , after illumination almost all devices showed occasional length resonant - like features in the conductance , perhaps due to the stronger 1d confining potential  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample was thermally cycled and measured on a second cooldown . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) shows a scatter plot of @xmath53 against @xmath54 , where @xmath54 ( @xmath53 ) is @xmath17 from the first ( second ) cooldown . an additional split gate did not define a 1d channel on the second cooldown , leaving a total of 240 devices . </S>",
    "<S> the data are categorised according to whether disorder was observed on both cooldowns ( 67.9@xmath26 ) , on neither cooldown ( 24.2@xmath26 ) , or only on one cooldown ( 7.9@xmath26 ) . therefore , whether disorder effects were or were not observed did not change for 92.1@xmath26 for devices . </S>",
    "<S> the pearson - product moment correlation coefficient @xmath55 quantifies the degree of correlation between two variables . for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) @xmath56 ( including all data ) , indicating a very strong correlation . the mean change in pinch - off voltage @xmath57 mv , which may be related to a change in @xmath58 on successive cooldowns . a large @xmath59 ( @xmath60 v ) , occurred for only 7 devices , irrespective of whether disorder effects were observed . since @xmath36 is dependent on electron density , a large @xmath59 may reflect local variations in @xmath2 due to a redistribution of ionised donors in the dopant layer .    by comparing conductance data from successive cooldowns </S>",
    "<S> it may be possible to distinguish between likely sources of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](b ) shows @xmath38 as a function of @xmath16 for a device in which the conductance characteristics are highly disordered . despite the disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is remarkably similar between cooldowns . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the effect , and the reproducibility on successive cooldowns suggests that an ionised impurity exists near the 1d channel .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](c ) shows @xmath38 against @xmath16 for another device , where the arrow indicates a weakened plateau on the second cooldown . </S>",
    "<S> such cooldown - dependent effects may be related to remote ionised donors , since the distribution of donors that are ionised varies on thermal cycling . additionally , the effect is relatively weak , consistent with the origin of the disorder being further away from the 1d channel ( i.e. separated from the 2deg by a 40 nm wide spacer layer ) .

    "<S> ( b ) , ( c ) conductance as a function of @xmath16 for two example split gates . in each panel </S>",
    "<S> the conductance traces from both cooldowns are shown . in ( c ) </S>",
    "<S> the arrow marks a weakened plateau , evidence of disorder on the second cooldown . ]    in summary : the reproducibility of electrical characteristics in 1d devices has been investigated , as a function of spatial location and after thermal cycling . </S>",
    "<S> this was made possible using a scalable on - chip multiplexer , which allowed 256 split gates to be individually measured during a single cooldown . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can be used to determine limiting factors on device reproducibility , and identify where to direct efforts for improvement . in the present study , disorder , variations in the density , and the re - distribution of dopant ions on </S>",
    "<S> the second cooldown were all limiting factors . </S>",
    "<S> improvements can be made by fabricating devices on a higher quality gaas / algaas heterostructure ( quantified by a greater @xmath3 ) , which will likely result in smaller variations of @xmath17 between devices , and fewer observable disorder effects . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , dopants can be removed entirely by fabricating devices on undoped heterostructures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may also be instructive to investigate how variations in density can be reduced by controlling the cooling process , and by illuminating the sample during the cooldown . </S>",
    "<S> this is an initial study , which has presented a framework for considering reproducibility in quantum devices . </S>",
    "<S> it can be used to test the suitability of devices for applications in quantum computing and spintronics . </S>"
