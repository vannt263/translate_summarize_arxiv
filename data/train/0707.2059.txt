    "they attribute the collapse to the increased h@xmath2  cooling rates at higher temperatures that is caused by greater dynamical heating in halos with @xmath118 .",
    "the cooling rate per molecule is 100 times larger at 2000 k than at 500 k , typical of pop iii star - forming halos without an uvb .",
    "most likely , the combination of the elevated h@xmath2  cooling rates and electron fractions from internal protogalactic shocks instigate the halo collapses in a strong uvb ( @xmath117 ) .    in any case , h@xmath2  cooling triggers collapses in halos with virial temperatures well below 10@xmath59 k. the lower critical halo mass , corresponding to  @xmath9 4000 k , increases mass fraction contained in these halos by three times at redshift 20 and the number density of high - redshift star forming halos by an order of magnitude ! by considering additional cases of extremely large negative feedback , we have strengthened the results of mba01 that h@xmath2  cooling plays a key role in high - redshift structure formation . we conclude that a uvb only delays and never completely suppresses h@xmath2  formation and cooling and subsequent star formation in these low - mass halos ."
