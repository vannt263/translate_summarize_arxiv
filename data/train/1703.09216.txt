    "since the pioneering works on the magnetic field dissipation in the neutron star ( ns ) cores by @xcite a significant progress has been made ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but many questions have still remained unanswered .",
    "one of these questions regards the effects of nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "how do they affect the magnetic field evolution ? in this short note we partly address this question by analyzing the effects of neutron superfluidity . as we believe , this analysis is more accurate ( and simple ) , than the previous treatments ( @xcite ) and it leads us to interesting conclusions .",
    "in essence , we argue that the neutron superfluidity drastically modifies the fluid dynamics , imposing an additional ( in comparison to the nonsuperfluid matter ) constraint on the velocities of different particle species . as a result ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion becomes completely irrelevant for the magnetic field evolution in the superfluid neutron - proton - electron ( @xmath0 ) matter , ones the stellar temperature @xmath1 falls ( even slightly ) below the neutron critical temperature  @xmath2 .",
    "then only ohmic decay and dissipation due to non - equilibrium beta - processes remain active .",
    "an admixture of muons ( @xmath3 ) introduces additional degree of freedom so that dissipation due to particle relative motion can again play a role .",
    "we follow the general strategy outlined in @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a newtonian non - rotating ns with the superfluid core composed of _ relativistic _ finite - temperature @xmath0 ( or @xmath4 ) matter , where neutrons are superfluid , and protons are normal ( nonsuperconducting ) . in the absence of magnetic field @xmath5 the star is in full thermodynamic and hydrostatic equilibrium , the velocities of all particle species vanish .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is the only mechanism that drives the star out of diffusive and beta - equilibrium .",
    "since the evolution occurs on a very long timescale ( @xcite ) , it proceeds through a set of quasistationary states , which means that the time derivatives in the `` euler equations '' ( eqs .",
    "[ nsfl][psfl ] and [ esflmu][psflmu ] , see below ) , as well as in the continuity equations , can be neglected .",
    "next , the magnetic field is considered as a small perturbation , hence the induced particle velocities are also small and the terms depending on square of these velocities in the dynamic equations can be omitted . for simplicity , we also ignore all surface integrals which could appear in the formulas : it is assumed that they vanish due to the boundary conditions ( if this is not the case they can be easily taken into account ) .",
    "the magnetic energy dissipates when the system evolves towards equilibrium .",
    "the rate of the magnetic energy change , @xmath6 can be presented as ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electric field ; @xmath9 is the charge current density and @xmath10 is the system volume .",
    "because neutrons are assumed to be in the superfluid state , there is an additional degree of freedom in the system  the neutron superfluid velocity @xmath11 , which is related to the wave function phase @xmath12 of the neutron cooper - pair condensate by the condition @xmath13 .",
    "generally , this velocity differs from the velocity of normal neutron component , @xmath14 . in the absence of rotation @xmath11 obeys the `` superfluid '' equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ) are already neglected . ]",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the speed of light ; @xmath17 is the neutron bare mass ; @xmath18 is the relativistic neutron chemical potential and @xmath19 is the gravitational potential . as we have already emphasized , it is justifiable to neglect small inertia term in this ( and other ) equations",
    ". then it reduces to @xmath20 note that this equation is valid at arbitrary temperature @xmath21 ( not only in the zero - temperature limit ) .",
    "the equations of motion for electrons and nonsuperconducting protons take the form ( @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proton electric charge , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the electron and proton velocities and relativistic chemical potentials , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath28 is the symmetric matrix that describes efficiency of particle collisions ( see @xcite ) and @xmath29 is the number density of particle species @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath23 . in eqs .",
    "( [ esfl ] ) and ( [ psfl ] ) thermo - diffusion terms are neglected .",
    "equations ( [ nsfl])([psfl ] ) should be supplemented by the total force balance equation , which , for the problem in question , takes the standard form ( the same for superfluid and nonsuperfluid liquids ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the pressure and energy density , and @xmath35 .",
    "let us now compose the following combination , @xmath36 ( [ esfl ] ) @xmath37 ( [ psfl])@xmath38 ( [ nsfl])]@xmath39([euler ] ) .",
    "taking into account the quasineutrality condition , @xmath40 , we get @xmath41 this equation imposes an additional ( in comparison to the non - superfluid matter ) constraint on the velocities @xmath42 . for example , if we neglect collisions between neutrons and electrons ( @xmath43 ) , we obtain @xmath44 .",
    "now , summing up @xmath45 ( [ esfl])@xmath37 ( [ psfl])@xmath46 ( [ nsfl ] ) , we arrive at @xmath47 where @xmath48 . in the newtonian limit @xmath49 , and we have @xmath50 note that the lorentz force @xmath51 depends on the gradient of only one scalar function ( in contrast to the non - superfluid matter , where it depends on the gradients of two scalar functions , see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that only very specific magnetic field configurations can restore hydrostatic equilibrium when neutrons are superfluid ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , once ns temperature drops below the neutron critical temperature @xmath2 at a given point , the magnetic field has to rearrange itself to meet the new hydrostatic equilibrium condition ( [ jb ] ) .",
    "this rearrangement may result in magnetar activity and of the magnetic field energy on a typical timescale of ns cooling . to find the dissipation rate @xmath52 ( [ ebdiss ] ) , we express @xmath53 from eq .",

    "( [ ebdissnpe ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath68\\ , dv , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the electrical conductivity in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "we come to an important conclusion that in superfluid @xmath0 matter there is no magnetic field dissipation due to ambipolar diffusion : magnetic field dissipates exclusively due to ohmic decay and non - equilibrium particle transformations .",
    "the former is extremely inefficient in neutron stars , where @xmath70 is the lengthscale of the magnetic field variation ( we take @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 is the temperature of the ns core , normalized to @xmath73 ( @xcite ) . ] , while the latter strongly depends on the rate of non - equilibrium beta - processes in ns matter .",
    "a typical dissipation timescale associated with these processes can be estimated as @xmath74 . in the case of modified urca ( murca )",

    "@xmath75 , too much to affect the magnetic field evolution . in turn , for the direct urca ( durca ) process we get @xmath76 , i.e. , durca can be effective dissipation agent for sufficiently strong magnetic fields",
    ".      an admixture of muons introduces an additional degree of freedom into the system .",
    "the dynamic equations for superfluid @xmath4 mixture consist of superfluid ( neutron ) eq .",
    "( [ nsfl ] ) together with the three equations on the charged components , @xmath77 in eqs .",

    "therefore , comparing to superfluid @xmath0-matter , there is more freedom to choose possible magnetic field configurations . proceeding in a similar way as in the case of @xmath0 matter",
    ", one can show that the magnetic field dissipation rate is given by matter , but then it is not constrained by eq .",

    "( [ ebdissnpemu ] ) and ( [ velrelmu ] ) , the magnetic field dissipation in @xmath4 matter is _ not _ associated exclusively with the ohmic decay and non - equilibrium beta - processes . even if we neglect the lepton interactions with neutrons ( @xmath89 ) , and find that @xmath90 from eq .",
    "( [ velrelmu ] ) ( i.e. , normal neutrons move with protons ) , the relative motion between electrons and muons will still enter the dissipation rate .",
    "the effect of such motion on the magnetic field dissipation can be relatively small , especially at large densities ( when muons more and more resemble electrons ) . but this should be checked by direct calculation which is beyond the scope of the present short note .",
    "concluding , the presence of muons ( or other , more exotic , particle species ) complicates the things and may , in principle , affect the magnetic field evolution in superfluid nss .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is irrelevant for the magnetic field dissipation in superfluid @xmath0 matter .",
    "magnetic field in this case dissipates only because of ohmic losses ( inefficient mechanism in the neutron star cores ) and non - equilibrium urca processes ( can be efficient if the direct urca process is open ) .",
    "since only very specific magnetic field configurations can ensure hydrostatic equilibrium in superfluid @xmath0 matter ( see section [ sec : ebdiss ] and the work by @xcite ) , magnetic field should `` feel '' expansion of the superfluid region upon ns cooling and reorganize itself accordingly on a cooling timescale",
    ". this may result in an increased magnetic activity , e.g. , in magnetars .",
    "an admixture of muons will restore , to some extent , the role of ambipolar diffusion for the magnetic field evolution , although the magnetic energy dissipation rate ( see eq .",
    "[ ebdissnpemu ] constrained by eq .  [ velrelmu ] ) will differ from that in non - superfluid matter .",
