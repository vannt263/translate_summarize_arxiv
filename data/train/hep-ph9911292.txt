    "leptoquarks are an undeniable signal of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and consequently , there have been several direct searches for them in accelerators . in fact , many theories that treat quarks and leptons in the same footing , like composite models @xcite , technicolor @xcite , and grand unified theories @xcite , predict the existence of new particles , called leptoquarks , that mediate quark - lepton transitions . since leptoquarks couple to a lepton and a quark , they are color triplets under @xmath2 , carry simultaneously lepton and baryon number , have fractional electric charge , and can be of scalar or vector nature .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", leptoquarks possess the striking signature of a peak in the invariant mass of a charged lepton with a jet , which make their search rather simple without the need of intricate analyses of several final state topologies .",
    "so far , all leptoquark searches led to negative results . at the hadron colliders , leptoquarks can be pair produced by gluon ",
    "gluon and quark  quark fusions , as well as singly produced in association with a lepton in gluon ",
    "quark reactions . at the tevatron ,",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations studied the pair production of leptoquarks which decay into electron - jet pairs @xcite .",
    "the combined cdf and d  limit on the leptoquark mass is @xmath3 gev @xcite for scalar leptoquarks decaying exclusively into @xmath0jet pairs . at hera ,",
    "first generation leptoquarks are produced in the @xmath4channel through their yukawa couplings , and the hera experiments @xcite placed limits on their masses and couplings , establishing that @xmath5 gev depending on the leptoquark type .    in this work we studied the single production of first generation leptoquarks ( @xmath6 ) in association with a charged lepton at the tevatron @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath7 we performed a careful analyses of all possible qcd and electroweak backgrounds for the topology exhibiting jets plus a @xmath1 pair using the event generator pythia @xcite .",
    "the signal was also generated using this package .",
    "we devised a series of cuts not only to reduce the background , but also to enhance the signal .",
    "since the available phase space for single production is larger than the one for double production , we show that the single leptoquark search can extend considerably the tevatron bounds on these particles .",
    "our results indicate that the combined results of the tevatron experiments can exclude the existence of leptoquarks with masses up to 260285 ( 370425 ) gev at the run i ( run ii ) , depending on their type , for yukawa couplings of the electromagnetic strength .",
    "it is interesting to notice that pair production of scalar leptoquarks in a hadronic collider is essentially model independent since the leptoquark ",
    "gluon interaction is fixed by the @xmath2 gauge invariance . on the other hand , single production is model dependent because it takes place via the unknown leptoquark yukawa interactions .",
    "notwithstanding , these two signals for scalar leptoquarks are complementary because they allow us not only to reveal their existence but also to determine their properties such as mass and yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons . in this work",
    ", we also studied the region in the parameter space where the single leptoquark production can be isolated from the pair production .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ l : eff ] we introduce the @xmath8 invariant effective lagrangians that we analyzed .",
    "we also discuss in this section the main features of the leptoquark signal and respective backgrounds .",
    "we present our results in sec.[resu ] while our conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "we assumed that scalar ",
    "leptoquark interactions are @xmath9 gauge invariant above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , leptoquarks must interact with a single generation of quarks and leptons with chiral couplings in order to avoid the low energy constraints @xcite .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian satisfying these requirements and baryon number ( b ) , lepton number ( l ) , electric charge , and color conservations is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) stands for the left - handed quark ( lepton ) doublet , and we omitted the flavor indices of the leptoquark couplings to fermions .",
    "the leptoquarks @xmath15 and @xmath16 are singlets under @xmath17 , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are doublets , and @xmath20 is a triplet .    from the above interactions we can see that first generation leptoquarks can decay into pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 , thus , giving rise to a @xmath0 plus a jet , or a jet plus missing energy",
    ". however , the branching ratio of leptoquarks into these final states depends on the existence of further decays , _ e.g. _ into new particles . in this work we considered only the @xmath21 decay mode and",
    "that the branching ratio into this channel ( @xmath23 ) is a free parameter . as we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ lag : fer ] ) and ( [ eff ] ) , only the leptoquarks @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 decay exclusively into a jet and a neutrino , and consequently can not give rise to the topology that we are interested in .",
    "the event generator pythia assumes that the leptoquark interaction with quarks and leptons is described by @xmath27 and the leptoquark cross sections are expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath28 defined as @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the fine structure constant .",
    "we present our results in terms of the leptoquark mass @xmath31 and @xmath28 , being trivial to translate @xmath28 into the coupling constants appearing in eqs.([lag : fer ] ) and ( [ eff ] ) ; see table [ t : cor ] .",
    "the subprocess cross section for the associated production of a leptoquark and a charged lepton @xmath32 depends linearly on the parameter @xmath28 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kap ] ) . for the range of leptoquark masses accessible at the tevatron , leptoquarks are rather narrow resonances with their width given by @xmath33    at the parton level",
    ", the single production of leptoquarks leads to a final state exhibiting a pair @xmath1 and @xmath13 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "after the parton shower and hadronization the final state usually contains more than one jet .",
    "an interesting feature of the final state topology @xmath1 and jets is that the double production of leptoquarks also contribute to it .",
    "consequently , the topology @xmath1jets has a cross section larger than the pair or single leptoquark productions alone , increasing the reach of the tevatron . in principle",
    "we can separate the single from the double production , for instance , requiring the presence of a single jet in the event .",
    "however , in the absence of any leptoquark signal , it is interesting not to impose this cut since in this case the signal cross section gets enhanced , leading to more stringent bounds .",
    "we exhibit in table [ t : sin1 ] the total cross section for the single production of leptoquarks that couple only to @xmath35 or @xmath36 pairs , assuming @xmath37 and @xmath38 and requiring one electron with @xmath39 gev , another one with @xmath40 gev , and @xmath41 for both @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the cross sections for the single production of @xmath42 and @xmath43 leptoquarks , that is @xmath44 or @xmath45 , are equal at the tevatron .",
    "furthermore , the cross section for the single production of a leptoquark coupling only to @xmath46 quarks is approximately twice the one for leptoquarks coupling only to @xmath47 quarks , in agreement with a naive valence  quark  counting rule .",
    "we display in table [ t : dou ] the production cross section of leptoquark pairs for the same choice of the parameters and cuts used in table [ t : sin1 ] .",
    "the small difference between the cross sections for the production of @xmath35 and @xmath36 leptoquarks is due to the exchange of a @xmath0 in the @xmath48channel of the reaction @xmath49 .    in our analyses we kept track of the @xmath0 ( jet ) carrying the largest transverse momentum , that we denoted by @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and the @xmath0 ( jet ) with the second largest @xmath52 , that we called @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the jets in the final state was done using the subroutine lucell of pythia , requiring the transverse energy of the jet to be larger than 7 gev inside a cone @xmath55 .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 originating from leptoquarks are shown in fig .",
    "[ sig : pt ] , where we required that @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev , and @xmath41 for both @xmath0 . in this figure , we added the contributions from single and pair production of @xmath60 leptoquarks of mass @xmath61 gev for @xmath62 tev .",
    "we can see from this figure that the @xmath50 and @xmath51 spectra are peaked approximately at @xmath63 and exhibit a large fraction of hard leptons , and consequently the @xmath52 cut on @xmath50 does not reduce significantly the signal .    within the scope of the sm ,",
    "there are many sources of backgrounds leading to jets accompanied by a pair @xmath1 .",
    "we divided them into three classes @xcite :    * _ qcd processes : _ the reactions included in the qcd class are initiated by hard scatterings proceeding exclusively through the strong interaction . in this class of processes , the main source of hard",
    "@xmath0 is the semileptonic decay of hadrons possessing quarks @xmath64 or @xmath65 , which are produced in the hard scattering or in the parton shower through the splitting @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "important features of the events in this class are that close to the hard @xmath0 there is a substantial amount of hadronic activity and that the @xmath0 transverse momentum spectrum is peaked at small values . * _ electroweak processes : _ this class contains the drell - yan production of quark / lepton pairs and the single and pair productions of electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the main backgrounds by far in this class are @xmath68 .",
    "this suggests that we should veto events where the invariant mass of the @xmath1 pair is around the @xmath69 mass ; however , even after such a cut , these backgrounds remain important due to the production of off - shell @xmath69 s . *",
    "_ top production : _ the production of top quark pairs takes place through quark  quark and gluon  gluon fusions . in general , the @xmath0 produced in the leptonic top decay into @xmath70 are rather isolated and energetic . fortunately , the top production cross section at the tevatron is rather small .    as an illustration",
    ", we present in table [ t : bckg ] the total cross section of the above background classes requiring the events to exhibit a @xmath0 with @xmath71 gev and a second @xmath72 having @xmath73 gev with the invariant mass of this pair differing from the @xmath69 mass by more than 5 gev .",
    "as we can see from this table , the introduction of this @xmath52 cut already reduces the qcd backgrounds to a level below the electroweak processes without on  mass - shell production of @xmath69 s . as we naively expect , the increase in the center  of  mass energy has a great impact in the top production cross section .",
    "taking into account the features of the signal and backgrounds , we imposed the following set of cuts :    * we required the events to exhibit a pair @xmath1 and one or more jets .",
    "* we introduced typical acceptance cuts  that is , the @xmath0 are required to be in the rapidity region @xmath74 and the jet(s ) in the region @xmath75 .",
    "* one of the @xmath0 should have @xmath71 gev and the other @xmath73 gev .",
    "* the @xmath0 should be isolated from hadronic activity .",
    "we required that the transverse energy deposited in a cone of size @xmath76 around the @xmath0 direction to be smaller than 10 gev .",
    "* we rejected events where the invariant mass of the pair @xmath1 ( @xmath77 ) is close to the @xmath69 mass , _",
    "i.e. _ we demanded that @xmath78 gev .",
    "this cut reduces the backgrounds coming from @xmath69 decays into a pair @xmath79 . *",
    "we required that _ all _ the invariant masses @xmath80 ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath45 ) are larger than 10 gev .",
    "* we accepted only the events which exhibit a pair @xmath0jet with an invariant mass @xmath83 in the range @xmath84 gev .",
    "an excess of events signals the production of a leptoquark .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mej ] we present the @xmath83 spectrum after the cuts ( c1)(c6 ) originating from the background and the production of a @xmath85 leptoquark of mass 250 gev with @xmath86 .",
    "the largest invariant mass of the four possible combinations is plotted both for background ( dashed line ) and signal ( solid line ) .",
    "the signal peak is clearly seen out of the background .      at this point",
    "it is interesting to obtain the attainable bounds on leptoquarks springing from the search of leptoquark pairs . in this case we required , in addition to cuts ( c1)(c7 ) , that the events present two @xmath0jet pairs with invariant masses satisfying @xmath84 gev .",
    "our results show that cdf and d  should be able to constrain the leptoquark masses to be heavier than 225 ( 350 ) gev at the run i ( run ii ) for @xmath38 and @xmath87 , assuming that only the background is observed . when the data of both experiment are combined , the limit changes to 250 ( 375 ) gev .",
    "it is interesting to notice that our results for the run i are compatible with the ones obtained by the tevatron collaborations @xcite .",
    "moreover , taking into account the single production of leptoquarks changes these constraints only by a few gev for @xmath37 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : xback ] the total background cross section and its main contributions as a function of @xmath31 after applying the cuts ( c1)(c7 ) for center  of  mass energies of 1.8 and 2.0 tev .",

    "we estimated the capability of the tevatron to exclude regions of the plane @xmath91 assuming that only the background events were observed .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : res]a the projected 95% cl exclusion region for @xmath85 and @xmath92 leptoquarks at the run i with an integrated luminosity of 110 pb@xmath93 per experiment . from our results we can learn that the search for single @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) leptoquarks in each experiment can exclude leptoquark masses up to 265 ( 245 ) gev for @xmath94 . combining the results of cdf and d",

    "it is important to stress that events exhibiting a pair of leptoquarks also contribute to our single leptoquark search .",
    "this is the reason why lighter leptoquarks can be observed even for arbitrarily small @xmath28 ; see figs.[fig : res ] .",
    "however , the maximum mass that can be excluded for @xmath96 is smaller than the limit coming from the search for leptoquark pairs since the requirement of an additional @xmath0jet pair with invariant mass close to @xmath97 helps to further reduce the backgrounds .",
    "for instance the single leptoquark search can rule out leptoquarks with masses up to 330 gev for @xmath87 at run ii while the search for leptoquark pairs leads to a lower bound of 375 gev .    in principle",
    "we can separate the double production of leptoquarks from the single one .",
    "an efficient way to extract the single leptoquark events is to require that just one jet is observed . at the run",

    "fig : sing ] .",
    "we can interpret this figure as the region of the @xmath98 where we can isolat the single leptoquark production and study this process in detail .",
    "the analyses of the single production of leptoquarks at the tevatron run i allow us to extend the range of excluded masses beyond the present limits stemming from the search of leptoquark pairs .",

    "@xmath100 these limits reduce to 250 ( 235 ) gev .",
    "moreover , combining the results from both experiments can further increase the tevatron reach for leptoquarks . assuming that leptoquarks decay exclusively into the known quarks and leptons and @xmath37",
