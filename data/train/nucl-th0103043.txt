    "we review in this contribution some topics on the low energy antiproton physics that raised our interest since the early shutdown of lear , as well as their relation with the theoretical models .",
    "the first section is devoted to nn system .",
    "we comment on the np results obtained by the obelix group and discuss with some more details the protonium p - level energy shifts measured by the ps207 experiment .",
    "the second section is devoted to the nd system .",
    "we present the first faddeev calculations for the nd scattering length and review the future perspectives from the theoretical side .",
    "unable to understand the annihilation at a quark level , we have here the possibility to understand it at the level of nucleons .",
    "the last obelix data on np cross section @xcite , presented in this conference by a. felicello @xcite , are very astonishing .",
    "the structures observed in the total and elastic cross section at antineutron laboratory momenta @xmath0 mev / c are not trivial results and can hardly be explained without assuming a nearthreshold state @xcite .",
    "these data have suffered from big fluctuations in the successive steps of their analysis @xcite and the only interesting question  i.e. to what extend they are significant  can not longer be answered at lear .",
    "the anomalous behaviour indeed concerns only two data points but if they were a consequence of an experimental problem , why should it manifest only in these two intermediate points ? as strange as they could appear , these data still remain inside the unitarity constraints .",
    "it would be of high interest if the ad could allow low energy scattering experiments .",
    "if a direct np measurement turns out to be not possible , one could see at least whether or not the structure is manifested in the pp cross section .",
    "the problem is modelized by @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the total energy  the same for all channels , @xmath3 the isospin components of the nn strong potential and @xmath4 the coulomb attraction.the np channel is dynamically decoupled from the two others .",
    "however , through the t=1 component of the nn potential , the np structure could be visible in the pp elastic cross section near the nn threshold .",
    "indeed , by assuming @xmath5 the center of mass momenta @xmath6 of the different channels are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 mev .",
    "the nn threshold ( @xmath9=0 ) correspond to the laboratory moment @xmath10=98.6 and @xmath11=69.7 mev / c , i.e. the region of the observed anomaly .",
    "we would like to notice however that this coincidence is only kinematical .",
    "calculations performed in the framework of both optical and unitary coupled - channel models showed that the influence of opening the nn threshold in the pp cross sections indeed exists but it is negligible . if some structure is seen in pp observables near the nn threshold it should have a dynamical origin .",
    "one of the most interesting results from lear _ post - mortem _ experiments is the @xmath12p@xmath13 protonium level shifts obtained in @xcite .",
    "these authors found the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 mev .",
    "the interest of this result is twofold .",
    "first because it is in qualitative agreement with a non trivial prediction of some meson exchange based models .",
    "second for the underlying dynamics that it supports .",
    ".protonium p - level shifts ( @xmath16 in mev ) and pp scattering volumes ( a=@xmath17 in fm@xmath12 ) in some optical models .",
    "the @xmath19 value is compared to experimental result from @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     even if the initial state has only one asymptotics , e.g. deuteron , the coupled equations will populate all the others and there will be always a non zero probability to leave the initial channel . as a consequence , even in absence of annihilation potential",
    ", the nd scattering length will have an imaginary part .",
    "we can thus distinguish two kinds of annihilation : the direct one and the one that takes place after the creation of a quasibound nn state . in a practical calculation",
    "we can not avoid taking into account these rearrangement channels .",
    "the results we have obtained for the two nd s - wave states  doublet ( @xmath20 ) and quartet ( @xmath21 )  are respectively @xmath22=@xmath23 fm and @xmath24=@xmath25 fm , what gives an spin - averaged value @xmath26=@xmath27 fm .",
    "each nn faddeev amplitude involves the @xmath28 components listed in table [ fadc ] which include all @xmath29 interactions .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results to those given by the nn amplitudes which are relevant in nd .",
    "their spin - averaged values , taken from table 1 in @xcite , are @xmath30=@xmath31 fm and @xmath32=@xmath33 fm .",
    "one then has im(@xmath26)@xmath34im(@xmath35 ) , in contrast to the findings of @xcite for pd . in view of this",
    "results one is tempted to conclude that nd annihilation is dominated by the nn channel .",
    "however in order to get some light on the annihilation mechanism an analysis of the nd wavefunction is required .",
    "@xmath36    we also remark that , contrary to nd case , there is very small spin dependence , that is @xmath37 .",
    "this could be expected from the fact that we are dealing with three non identical particles .",
    "it is worth noticing however that with im(v)=0 , the values are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of annihilation potential is to move the two spin values in opposite directions towards an almost degenerate result . in figures [ aq_w0 ] and [ ad_w0 ]",
    "is displayed the variation of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath40 as a function of a scaling factor @xmath41 multiplying im(v ) .",
    "they show a smoother behaviour than the one found in the model calculation of @xcite .",
    "= 7.0 cm    we note also that results can vary up to a factor two depending on the states included in the rearrangement channels .",
    "there are however dominant amplitudes which are @xmath42s@xmath13 and @xmath12sd@xmath43 .",
    "p - wave seems to account for only @xmath44 variation .    to our knowledge",
    ", there is no any experimental value for nd to compare with .",
    "wycech et al .",
    "@xcite found @xmath45 and @xmath46 and even smaller values were found in @xcite . in view of comparing these results with those obtained in @xcite from pd experiment ",
    "im(@xmath47)=0.62@xmath480.02  coulomb corrections should be included .",
    "these calculations can be improved in several ways .",
    "for instance by including d - wave component in deuteron , by coupling the nn amplitude to the pp one and by disentangling the contribution of the different rearrangement channels .",
    "the sensitivity to asymptotic states would also require to use different nn models .",
    "this work is being pursued by extending to nd p - waves and by including coulomb interactions in the pd system .",
    "some years after its shutdown , lear continues to produce interesting results .",
    "this shows that its unique characteristics ",
    "low energy and high resolution experiments  were very appropriate for understanding the nn interaction .",
    "if stopping lear was a mistake , it would be a fault to stop such an activity , not adapting the ad facility to low energy scattering experiments , against the request of several groups @xcite .",
    "we have shown  if needed ",
    "the interest in pursuing low energy antiproton physics in three different problems .",
    "the intriguing low energy np observed structure could be also seen  and thus confirmed  in the elastic pp cross section near the charge - exchange threshold .",
    "the measured @xmath19 protonium level shift constitutes a strong indication of a nn nearthreshold state in isospin zero channel .",
    "this measure should be confirmed and if possible extended to other partial waves .",
    "the nd reaction is of interest in understanding the annihilation mechanism .",
    "we have presented the first nd results based on exact solutions of faddeev equations .",
    "this theoretical effort should be pursued by extending the calculations to negative parity states  where the @xmath49 pole could also manifest  and to pd system .",
    "we would like to emphasize that only the knowledge of the isolated partial wave contributions provides effective constraints to models .",
    "the @xmath19 constitutes a nice illustration of how interesting phenomena , not even visible in the cross sections , can manifest after such a separation . for that purpose  and in absence of polarized beams ",
    "the atomic experiments seem to be the only ones offering such a possibility .",
