    "there are expected various form of matter inside neutron stars ( fig .",
    "[ fignstar ] ) , many of which are associated with first order phase transitions ( fopt ) .",
    "recently there are many studies of the mixed phases at these fopt such as hadron - quark deconfinement transition @xcite , kaon condensation @xcite , color superconductivity @xcite , superfluidity in atomic traps @xcite , nuclear pastas @xcite , etc . before the remark by glendenning many authors used the maxwell construction ( mc ) to get the equation of state ( eos ) in thermodynamic equilibrium for fopt .",
    "nowadays there exists a view that not all gibbs conditions can be satisfied in the description of the maxwell construction in _ multi - component _ systems and the appearance of the mixed phases is inevitable , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in this lecture",
    "we discuss two types of the mixed phases expected in nuclear matter ; one is so called the `` nuclear pastas '' at subnuclear densities , and the other is the one following kaon condensation above the nuclear density .",
    "we shall see non - uniform geometrical structures in both cases .",
    "consider a mixed - phase consisting of two phases in equilibrium , say i and ii .",
    "the system should be totally neutral but composed of many particle species in chemical equilibrium through weak processes .",
    "when we impose the baryon number and charge conservation on this system , we can easily see that only two chemical potentials are independent ; one is baryon - number chemical potential @xmath7 and the other is charge chemical potential @xmath8 .",
    "once @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given , all the chemical potentials of particle species are determined .",
    "then each particle density may spatially change in the mixed phase by the strong and electroweak interactions , but chemical potentials must be constant over the whole space .",
    "the gibbs conditions ( gc ) for thermodynamic equilibrium between two phases i and ii are given by @xmath9 in this case , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote temperature and pressure of each phase , respectively .",
    "r0.63     it has been claimed that usual mc satisfies only the first three conditions , and the final one is violated because it assumes the local charge neutrality in each phase instead of the global charge neutrality .",
    "a naive application of the gibbs conditions to separate bulk phases without the surface and the coulomb interaction , demonstrates a broad density - region of the structured mixed phase @xcite .",
    "when one takes into account the geometrical structures like droplet , rod and slab by extending the bulk calculation , one can see that the surface tension and coulomb interaction determine their size @xcite",
    ". however , the charge screening effect ( caused by the rearrangement of the charged - particle distributions ) should be very important when the typical size is of the order of the minimal debye screening length in the problem .",
    "it may largely affect the stability condition of the geometrical structures in the mixed phases .",
    "we have been recently exploring the effect of the charge screening in the context of the various structured mixed phases @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to investigate the non - uniform structures in nuclear matter numerically by means of the density functional theory with a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model .",
    "our framework allows one to determine the density profiles exactly without any sharp boundary and the surface tension used in the bulk calculations .",
    "it includes the coulomb interaction in a proper way and we can fully take into account the charge screening effects .",
    "we shall figure out how the charge screening effects induce the rearrangement of the charged - particle distributions and thereby modify the results obtained by the bulk calculations .",
    "first we consider the nuclear pastas . at subnuclear densities , where pressure of the uniform nuclear matter is negative , so called `` nuclear pastas ''",
    "may appear @xcite .",
    "in view of the phase transition , these can be regarded as the mixed phases following the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter .",
    "stable nuclear shape may change from sphere to rod , slab , tube and to bubble with increase of the matter density .",
    "pastas are eventually dissolved into the uniform matter ( liquid phase ) at a certain nucleon density below the saturation density , @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "existence of such pasta phases instead of the crystalline lattice of nuclei or the liquid @xmath14 phase would modify some important processes by changing the hydrodynamic properties and the neutrino opacity in the supernova matter and in the protoneutron stars . also the pasta phases may influence neutron star quakes and pulsar glitches via the change of mechanical properties of the crust matter .",
    "a number of authors have discussed the nuclear pastas using various models @xcite , but most of them have relied on the bulk calculations ; roughly speaking , the favorable nuclear shape is determined by a balance between the surface and the coulomb energies .",
    "thus the coulomb interaction as well as the surface tension has an crucial role in the non - uniform pasta structures .",
    "however , the treatment of the coulomb interaction so far has been rather simple and the rearrangement effect on the density profiles of the charged particles by the coulomb interaction has been discarded in the bulk calculations .",
    "the paper @xcite discusses the effect of electron screening to demonstrate that it is of a minor importance , but the rearrangement of the proton density as a consequence of the coulomb repulsion was not shown up in their study .",
    "following the idea of the density functional theory ( dft ) with the rmf model @xcite , we can formulate equations of motion to study non - uniform nuclear matter numerically .",
    "the rmf model with fields of mesons and baryons introduced in a lorentz - invariant way is simple for numerical calculations , but realistic enough to reproduce the bulk properties of finite nuclei as well as saturation properties in nuclear matter . in our framework , the coulomb interaction is properly included in equations of motion for nucleons , electrons , and meson mean - fields , and we solve the poisson equation for the coulomb potential @xmath15 self - consistently with them .",
    "thus the baryon and electron density profiles , as well as the meson mean - fields , are determined in a way fully consistent with the coulomb potential .    to begin with ,",
    "we present the thermodynamic potential for the neutron , proton and electron system with chemical potentials @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ; @xmath19 where @xmath20    % \\right )    , \\ ] ] with the local fermi momenta , @xmath21 , for nucleons , @xmath22   ,   \\label{eq : omegam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the scalar ( @xmath23 ) and vector mean - fields ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25,\\ ] ] for electrons and the coulomb potential , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and the nonlinear potential for the scalar field , @xmath28 . temperature @xmath29 is kept to be zero in the present study .",
    "here we used the local - density approximation ( lda ) for nucleons and electrons . strictly speaking ,",
    "lda is meaningful only if the typical length of the nucleon density variation is larger than the inter - nucleon distance . to go beyond lda",
    "we must take into account some derivative terms with respect to particle densities , which can be easily incorporated in the quasi - classical manner by the derivative expansion within the density functional theory @xcite . in the case",
    "when we suppress derivative terms of nucleon densities they follow changes of the meson mean fields and the coulomb field that have derivative terms .",
    "we must also bear in mind that for small structure sizes , quantum effects become prominent which we disregarded . here",
    "we consider large - size pasta structures and simply discard the derivative terms , as a first - step calculation .",
    "parameters of the rmf model are chosen to reproduce saturation properties of nuclear matter : the minimum energy per baryon @xmath30 mev at @xmath31 @xmath13 , the incompressibility @xmath32 mev , the effective nucleon mass @xmath33 ; @xmath34 mev , and the isospin - asymmetry coefficient @xmath35   mev .",
    "coupling constants and meson masses used in our calculation are listed in table 1 .    .",
    "parameter set used in rmf in our calculation .",

    "lagrangian for simplicity , which is not chiral - symmetric . ]",
    "the equations of motion are then similar to eqs .",
    "( 5 ) - ( 11 ) given for nuclear pastas except kaon contributions @xcite .",
    "additional parameters concerning kaons are presented in table 2 .",
    "if glendenning s claim were correct , the structured mixed phase would develop in a broad density range from well below to well above the critical density @xcite . in this density interval the matter should exhibit the structure change similar to the nuclear pastas @xcite : the kaonic droplet , rod , slab , tube , bubble .",
    "actually we observe such structures ( kaonic pastas ) in our calculation . in the top",
    "( a ) and the middle ( b ) panels of fig .",
    "[ figkeos ] we show eos ; pieces of solid curves indicate the energetically most favored structures , while the dotted curve eos of the uniform matter .",
    "one can see the softening of eos by the appearance of kaonic pastas",
    ". in the bottom panel ( c ) plotted are the size of the kaonic lump or hole and the cell size .",
    "r0.45     the dashed lines show the debye screening lengths of the electron and the proton , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . in most cases @xmath41 is less than the cell size @xmath43 but it is larger than the structure size @xmath44 .",
    "however the proton debye length @xmath42 is always shorter than @xmath43 and @xmath44 . when the minimal value of the debye length inside the structure is shorter or of the order of @xmath44 , the charge screening effects should be pronounced @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate the charge screening effect on the kaonic mixed phase and discuss differences among various treatments , we show pressure @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) in the middle panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figkeos ] and the phase diagrams in the @xmath7-@xmath18 plane in fig .",
    "[ figkmumu ] . from fig .",
    "[ figkeos ] ( b ) we can clearly see that our results give the similar pressure to the one given by mc , while the bulk calculation , where no coulomb interaction or surface energy is taken into account , gives a wide density region for the mixed phase .",
    "we can get more insight about the role of the coulomb interaction in fig .",
    "[ figkmumu ] ; left panel in fig .",
    "[ figkmumu ] exhibits the full calculation , while in the right panel we show the case , when the electric potential is discarded in determining the density profile ( `` no coulomb '' ) and the coulomb energy , using the density profile thus determined , is then added to the total energy .",
    "we use `` no coulomb '' in the same meaning as in the nuclear pastas .",
    "we see that in `` no coulomb '' case the pieces of solid curves lie between two curves given by the bulk calculation ( indicated by `` gibbs '' ) , where the gibbs conditions are imposed disregarding the surface tension and the coulomb interaction , and by the maxwell construction ( indicated by `` maxwell '' ) .",
    "the `` full calculation '' case is more close to the one given by the maxwell construction . as follows from the density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ figkprofcompare ] , the local charge neutrality is more pronounced in the case of the `` full calculation '' ( smaller difference of kaon and proton densities ) .",

    "we have discussed two kinds of the non - uniform structures in nuclear matter , nuclear pastas at subnuclear densities and the kaon mixed phase above the nuclear density , which may arise as consequences of fopt with many particle species , and elucidated the charge screening effect . using a self - consistent framework based on density functional theory and relativistic mean fields , we took into account the coulomb interaction in a proper way and numerically solved coupled equations of motion to extract the density profiles of nucleons , electrons and kaons .",
    "first of all , we have checked how realistic our framework is by studying the bulk properties of finite nuclei , as well as the saturation properties of nuclear matter , and found that it can describe both features satisfactorily .",
    "one could still improve the consideration by including the gradient terms of the nucleon densities , which may give a better description of the nuclear surface .",
    "in isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter with fixed proton to atomic number ratios , we have observed the `` nuclear pastas '' with various geometrical structures at sub - nuclear densities .",
    "these cases are relevant for the discussion of the supernova explosions and for the description of the newly born neutron stars .",
    "the appearance of the pasta structures significantly lowers the energy , i.e. softens the equation of state , while the energy differences between various geometrical structures are rather small . by comparing different treatments of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "we have seen that the self - consistent inclusion of the coulomb interaction changes the phase diagram .",
    "in particular the region of pasta structure is broader for `` full '' calculation compared to that with simplified treatments of the coulomb interaction which have been used in the previous studies .",
    "the effect of the rearrangement of the proton distributions on the structures is much more pronounced compared to the effect of the electron charge screening .",
    "the influence of the charge screening on the equation of state , on the other hand , was found to be small .",
    "we have also studied the structure of the nucleon matter in the beta equilibrium .",
    "we have found that only one type of structures is realized : proton - enriched droplets embedded in the neutron sea .",
    "no other geometrical structures like rod , slab , etc . appeared .",
    "we have discussed how the geometrical structures manifest in the context of kaon condensation .",
    "our framework can be extended to include kaons straightforwardly .",
    "we have discussed the effect of the charge screening in this case . since the kaon mixed - phase appear at high - densities",
    ", we see that changes are more remarkable than for the `` nuclear pastas '' at subnuclear densities @xcite .",
    "the density range of the structured mixed phase is largely limited by the charge screening and thereby the phase diagram becomes similar to that given by the maxwell construction .",
    "although the importance of such a treatment has been demonstrated for the hadron - quark matter transition @xcite , one of our new findings here is that we can figure out the role of the charge screening effect without introducing an `` artificial '' input of the surface tension . in our study",
    "we have used the one - boson - exchange interaction for the @xmath47 interaction . on the other hand",
    "the bulk calculation , where no coulomb interaction nor surface tension is included , can not give the mixed phase in the chiral model @xcite .",
    "it should be interesting to study the effects of the charge screening to see whether the chiral model is not thermodynamically well - defined .    in application to the newly formed neutron stars like in supernova explosions , finite temperature and neutrino trapping effects",
    "become important , as well as the dynamics of the first order phase transition with formation of the structures .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our framework to include these effects .",
