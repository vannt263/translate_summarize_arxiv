    "experiments at brookhaven s ags have already revealed much interesting new physics during the last few years@xcite . in the next few years",
    "several important experiments will be carried out at ags to further study the properties of hot and dense hadronic matter , and to search for the signals for chiral symmetry restoration and/or quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) formation@xcite . among the proposed experiments we are particularly interested in those by the e895 and e866 collaboration which will carry out extensive systematic studies at several beam momenta between 2 and 12 gev / c using a au beam@xcite .",
    "these experiments are interesting and important as it has been predicted based on hydrodynamical models that the qgp phase transition may occur in heavy - ion collisions at energies between @xmath0= 2 - 10 gev@xcite .",
    "also , theoretical studies ( e.  g.  @xcite ) have shown that the properties of hadrons , such as their masses and decay widths , may be modified in hot dense hadronic matter as a result of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "since the maximum baryon density achievable in heavy ion collisions at ags energies varies from about @xmath1 to @xmath2 these experiments provide also a good opportunity to study the change of medium effects with density .",
    "comparisons between experimental and theoretical studies in this energy range are therefore very useful in searching for the signals for chiral symmetry restoration and/or baryon - rich qgp formation as well as testing various other predictions@xcite . in addition , how the reaction dynamics and the mechanism for particle production change in this energy range are also interesting by themselves .    in this paper",
    ", we present and discuss our predictions on the excitation functions for a number of important quantities about the reaction dynamics and experimental observables in central au+au reactions using a relativistic transport model ( art 1.0 ) .",
    "in particular , we examine excitation functions of the stopping power , maximum baryon and energy densities achievable , the population of resonance matter as well as the strength of the transverse and radial flow .",
    "the calculated maximum baryan and energy densities are further compared with predictions of the relativistic hydrodynamics assuming the formation of shock waves .",
    "we also discuss the excitation function of the pion multiplicity in terms of the fermi - landau scaling variable .",
    "this work is a continuation of our recent efforts in studying systematically the reaction dynamics , particle production mechanisms , the properties of superdense hadronic matter@xcite , and the signatures of chiral symmetry restoration and qgp formation at ags energies using the relativistic transport model ( art ) .",
    "details of the transport model has been given in ref.@xcite , here we will only give a brief summary of the model in section ii . in section",
    "iii we present and discuss our results",
    ". a summary will be given at the end .",
    "the model art 1.0 is based on the very successful buu transport model ( e.g. @xcite ) for intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions by including more baryon and meson resonances as well as the interactions among them .",
    "more specifically , we have included in art 1.0 the following baryons : @xmath3 , and mesons : @xmath4 , as well as their explicit isospin degrees of freedom . both elastic and inelastic collisions among most of these particles are included as best as we can by using as inputs the experimental data from hadron - hadron collisions . however , more than 200 reaction channels are listed in the cern data book@xcite for the nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon collisions .",
    "we certainly have not fully incorporated all these channels . instead ,",
    "most of inelastic hadron - hadron collisions are modeled through the formation of baryon and meson resonances . although we only included explicitly the three baryon resonances @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , effects of heavier baryon resonances are partially included by using meson+baryon cross sections calculated from the implicit formation of these heavier resonances with masses up to 2 gev .",
    "we have also included in the model an optional , self - consistent mean field for baryons .    using this model",
    "we have recently studied in refs.@xcite heavy - ion reactions at beam energies of about 12 gev / nucleon . in particular ,",
    "we have explored effects of nuclear mean field on the collision dynamics , the volume and lifetime of the superdense hadronic matter , single particle observables as well as the radial and transverse collective flow of nucleons and pions .",
    "it has been found that the mean field significantly reduces the maximum energy and baryon densities of the superdense hadronic matter formed in the collision . on the other hand ,",
    "inclusive , single particle observables are found to depend on the equation of state only at the level of 20% .",
    "the mean field also affects significantly the transverse collective flow of baryons .",
    "in particular , a soft nuclear equation of state increases the flow parameter by a factor of 2.5 compared to that from pure cascade calculations .",
    "it is important to stress that art is a purely hadronic model and its validity naturally breaks down when the qgp is formed in the collision .",
    "however , results from hadronic transport models are useful as they provide the necessary background against which one can identify new physics phenomena due to , for example , chiral symmetry restoration and/or the formation of qgp .",
    "it is in this sense we present and discuss in the following our model predictions .",
    "we are particularly interested in the beam energy dependence of several important quantities which may be related to the qgp phase transition and/or the chiral symmetry restoration in central au+au reactions .",
    "for some quantities we also compare predictions using the cascade mode of art 1.0 and a soft nuclear equation of state corresponding to a compressibility of 200 mev .",
    "we restrict our discussions to the beam momentum range of 2 to 12 gev / c as systematic studies of heavy - ion collisions at lower energies have previously been studied extensively during the last decade by many groups using various transport models ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , one can find in ref .",
    "@xcite a study on the beam energy dependence of au+au collisions using an early version of the present model .      in this section ,",
    "we shall find the maximum baryon and energy densities reached in heavy - ion collisions in the energy range available at ags and compare them with the transition densities expected for the qgp .",
    "we also would like to find the lowest beam energy at which the qgp transition may occur .",
    "we first recall the notations used for specifying the compression .",
    "we use the standard test particle method@xcite to calculate the global baryon density matrix @xmath7 and energy density matrix @xmath8 in the nucleus - nucleus c.m .",
    "frame on a lattice of size @xmath9 with a volume of 1 @xmath10 for each cell .",
    "the compression is then given by the local baryon and energy density matrixes obtained via @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lorentz factor for each cell , i.e.    @xmath14    with @xmath15 running over all particles in the cell .    to find the beam energy at which the maximum compression is reached ,",
    "we examine the time dependence of the central baryon and energy densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 for au+au collisions at beam momenta from 2 to 12 gev / c and an impact parameter of 2 fm corresponding to typical central collisions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  1 and fig .  2 for the case of pure cascade and the case of using the soft equation of state , respectively .",
    "we notice that the maximum compression is reached at the highest beam energy available at the ags .",
    "although the increase of the maximum density becomes slower starting at a beam momentum of about 8 gev / c , it obviously does not saturate even up to 12 gev / c .",
    "we thus expect that even higher densities can be reached in heavy - ion collisions at energies above the ags energies .",
    "this observation is useful for considerations of future experimental programs , such as those at the gsi@xcite .",
    "since the qgp phase transition energy density has been estimated to be about 2 @xmath18@xcite , our calculations from both the cascade and the transport model with the soft equation of state indicate that it can already occur at beam momenta above about 8 gev / c .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been quite successful in studying many aspects of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( for a recent review , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one aspect which is particularly interesting to us in the present study is the possibility of forming shock waves in heavy - ion collisions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics",
    "it was predicted that the shock waves are nearly completely developed in heavy - ion collisions at beam energies higher than about 400 mev / nucleon@xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can estimate the maximum compression behind the shock fronts by studying the propogation dynamics of the shock waves .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the predictions on the maximum compression from the transport model and the relativistic hydrodynamics model .",
    "here we perform such a comparison for head - on collisions of au+au in the beam momentum range of 2 to 12 gev / c .",
    "the maximum compression attainable in a heavy - ion collision can be obtained by either solving the rankine - hugoniot ( rh ) equation@xcite ( e.g. , in refs.@xcite ) or directly seeking for approximate solutions of the hydrodynamical equations ( e.g. , in refs.@xcite ) . here",
    "we solve numerically the rh equation using the approach detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the maximum baryon density @xmath19 satisfies the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the energy density of nuclear matter ahead of the shock front .",
    "@xmath23 is the ratio of the thermal pressure and the energy density . for a detailed discussion about effects of the parameter @xmath23 on the maximum compression",
    "we refer the reader to section 2.4 of ref .",
    "we found that a value of @xmath24 corresponding to a non - relativistic gas can best describe our results from the transport model . in the above",
    ", @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy density at zero temperature . for a soft equation of state as used in the transport model",
    ", we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 mev , @xmath31 mev , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the fermi energy in the ground state of nuclear matter and @xmath34 is the nucleon mass .    to compare the prediction of relativistic hydrodynamics with that from our cascade calculations , we set @xmath35 and obtain the analytical solution@xcite @xmath36 the maximum baryon density and the maximum energy density obtained via @xmath37 using the above formula",
    "are shown by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "the solid lines are obtained by solving numerically eq .",
    "( [ shock ] ) using an iterative method for the soft equation of state .",
    "results from the cascade and the transport model with the soft equation of state are shown by the open and filled circles .",
    "we are amased to see that the predictions from the two calculations agree so well , especially at beam momenta below 9 gev / c / nucleon . for head - on collisions of au+au at beam energies below 2 gev / nucleon",
    ", danielewicz@xcite has also compared predictions on the maximum compression using both the hadrodynamics model and the buu model .",
    "he has found that the two results agree very well at beam energies above about 1.0 gev / nucleon while at lower energies the hydrodynamics model predicts a higher compression .",
    "our results are in agreement with his , and , furthermore , our study has extended the comparison to higher energies .",
    "we notice that there are some small discrepancies between predictions of our transport model and the hydrodynamics model at beam momenta higher than about 10 gev / c .",
    "these discrepancies are , however , expected .",
    "first , the system under study deviates from a non - relativistic gas at increasingly higher energies , and consequently the parameter @xmath23 will become smaller than 2/3 .",
    "in fact , the approximate expressions for the maximum baryon density and the maximum energy density derived for an ultra - relativistic ideal gas in ref.@xcite using the relativistic hydrodynamics roughly reproduce our transport model calculations at high energies but underpredict significantly those at low energies .",
    "second , conditions for applying the hydrodynamics , such as the local thermal equilibrium , may not be completely satisfied in transport model calculations at high energies .",
    "another factor may also contribute to the difference is the finite size of lattice cells used to calculate the baryon and energy densities in the transport model .",
    "the stopping power can be measured by the rapidity distribution of nucleons .",
    "previous experiments at ags for central collisions of au+au at 12 gev / c have shown nearly complete stopping@xcite and can be well reproduced by our model calculations as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .  4",
    ", we show the rapidity distribution of nucleons at 6 different beam momenta between 2 and 12 gev / c for the reaction of au+au at an impact parameter of 2 fm .",
    "the results are obtained with the soft equation of state . to gain information about the stopping dynamics ,",
    "we further show the time evolution of the rapidity distribution from t=2 fm / c to 20 fm / c at a time interval of 2 fm / c .",
    "it is seen that a high degree of stopping is reached at all beam energies .",
    "the time to reach the stable rapidity distribution decreases rapidly as the beam energy increases .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the reduced reaction time , which scales approximately with the inverse of the lorentz @xmath13 factor and increased baryon - baryon collision rates with increasing beam momentum as shown in fig .  5      the transverse and radial flow of various hadrons in heavy - ion collisions at both low ( nscl / msu , sis",
    "/ gsi and bevelac / berkeley ) and high ( ags and cern ) energies have been studied extensively during the last few years .",
    "one of the motivations of the e895 and e866 experiments is to study the strength of collective flows as the beam energy increases from the highest energy available at sis / gsi and/or bevelac / berkeley to that at ags / brookhaven .",
    "the experimental results will be useful for testing various theoretical predictions .",
    "for example , recent quark - gluon - string model calculations have shown that the formation of a quark - gluon - plasma drastically reduces the transverse collective flow@xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown in a relativistic hydrodynamical model that the strength of collective flow should show a minimum at about 6 gev / nucleon when the qgp transition occurs@xcite .",
    "to study the transverse flow we use the standard method of danielewicz and odyniec@xcite , i.e. , analyzing the average transverse momentum in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity .",
    "we then extract the flow parameter @xmath38 and study its dependence on the beam energy .",
    "results of this analysis from both the cascade and the transport model with the soft equation of state are shown in fig .  6 for the reaction of au+au at an impact parameter of 2 fm .",
    "two interesting features are worth of mentioning .",
    "first , in both cases the transverse flow parameter @xmath39 decreases quickly as the beam momentum increases from 2 to about 7 gev / c , and it then more or less saturates .",
    "second , the predicted flow parameter from the cascade is about a factor of two smaller than that using the soft equation of state in the whole energy range .",
    "it is well - known from experiments at bevalac and sis / gsi that the strength of transverse flow increases with the beam energy up to about 1 gev / nucleon in the reaction of au+au@xcite .",
    "there are , however , still some discrepancies among data from different experiments as to whether the flow saturates or decreases above about 1 gev / nucleon for the reaction of au+au . to understand the decrease in the strength of the transverse flow as the beam momentum increases above about 2 gev / c , we examine schematically the maximum flow parameter @xmath40 as a function of the beam momentum .",
    "for the purpose of qualitative discussions we assume that contributions to the flow parameter from nucleon - nucleon collisions and the mean field are additive , i.e. @xmath41 in the above @xmath42 is the net transverse momentum generated by nucleon - nucleon collisions and @xmath43 is the force acting on nucleons along the @xmath44 direction in the reaction plane ; @xmath45 is the reaction time . from the pure cascade calculations shown in fig .",
    "6 it is seen that the contribution from collisions decreases with increasing beam energy .",
    "this is mainly due to the rapidly decreasing reaction time @xmath46 during which the thermal pressure creates a sideward deflection in the reaction plane .",
    "the second term depends on both the reaction time and the density gradient which is expected to increase with increasing beam energy . from the difference of the two calculations shown in fig .",
    "6 it is seen that the second term of eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) is almost a constant .",
    "since both the reaction time @xmath46 and the center of mass rapidity @xmath47 reduce the second term as the beam momentum increases , the above observation indicates that the force @xmath43 due to the mean field increases as a result of the larger density gradients achieved at higher energies .",
    "the decrease of the flow parameter @xmath39 with increasing beam energy is thus a result of the reaction dynamics .",
    "furthermore , one can conclude that the competing effects from the mean field and the reaction time result in a peak in the strength of the transverse flow at beam momentum around 2 gev / c .",
    "the experiments by the eos / e895 collaboration in measuring the flow parameter from bevalac energies up to the ags energies are therefore very useful in understanding the effect of collision dynamics on collective flows .",
    "to further understand how the transverse flow is generated during the reaction , we compare in fig .  7 the time evolution of the flow parameter @xmath39 at beam momenta of 2 and 12 gev / c",
    "it is seen that @xmath39 saturates after about 17 and 10 fm / c , respectively , for the reaction at 2 and 12 gev / c .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at the beginning of the reaction at 2 gev / c there is a weak antiflow due to the attractive interaction between particles on the two surfaces .",
    "however , it eventually changes to a large positive value in agreement with our discussions above .",
    "the strength of the radial flow is characterized by the average radial flow velocity @xmath48 defined as @xmath49 where the summation is over all test particles in the system .",
    "the value of @xmath48 at t=20 fm / c is shown in fig .  8 for both the cascade and the transport model with the soft equation of state .",
    "we see that the radial flow velocity increases quickly and saturates at a value of about 0.78 c. the similar results from the two cases further indicate that the radial flow is mainly determined by the thermal pressure rather than the potential pressure . since the thermal pressure increases with increasing beam energy as discussed above , the radial flow increases thus with the beam energy .",
    "the larger average radial flow velocity obtained from the transport model than those extracted experimentally from heavy - ion collisions at both bevalac and ags energies deserves some discussions .",
    "experimentally the average radial flow velocity is usually determined by fitting the particle spectra using a thermal source of temperature @xmath50 boosted by an azimuthally symmetric flow velocity @xmath51 which is taken to be proporntial to certain power of the radial coordinate @xmath52 .",
    "however , it was pointed out recently that it was not possible to accurately extract the true temperature and the correct average radial flow velocity using this procedure@xcite . since the probability for a particle to receive a radial flow velocity @xmath51 is @xmath53 one needs to know not only the flow profile @xmath54 but also the density distribution @xmath55 which is certainly not uniform as usually assumed . in fact , the extracted temperature assuming a uniform density is found to be much higher ( e.g. , a factor of about 2 for the reaction of au+au at @xmath56=150 mev ) than the chemical temperature extracted by using microscopic models@xcite .",
    "the average radial flow velocity extracted experimentally is therefore correspondingly smaller .      the possible formation of a resonance matter at sis / gsi and/or ags energies has been an interesting topic for many discussions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here we examine the energy dependence of the creation and decay of baryon resonances in central au+au collisions at @xmath57 from 2 to 12 gev / c . in fig .  9 , we show the relative abundance of baryon resonances @xmath58 ( upper window ) and @xmath59 ( lower window ) as a function of time and beam momentum .",
    "first , it is observed that the maximum resonance / baryon ratio increases from about 20% to 45% as the beam momentum increases from 2 to 12 gev / c .",
    "this corresponds to an increase of the resonance density from about @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "of course , in a small volume around the center of the participant region the ratio is even higher . from the lower window , we see that the ratio @xmath62 in the expansion stage decreases as the beam energy increases .",
    "this is understandable from the pion production dynamics . at lower energies available at sis / gsi ,",
    "pions are almost completely produced through the resonances @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , on the average the resonances created at sis / gsi energies have relatively lower masses and therefore longer lifetimes . as the beam energy increases not",
    "only the production of direct pions and meson resonances become increasingly important but also the created baryon resonances have heavier masses and correspondingly shorter lifetimes . consequently",
    ", @xmath62 decreases with increasing beam momentum .",
    "it is important to point out here that one should not compare directly the calculated resonance / baryon ratio at any particular time with the ratio extracted experimentally by studying @xmath65 correlations , such as done by the e814 collaboration@xcite , as calculations from both our model and the recent quark - gluon string model indicate that hadrons are continuously emitted during the whole reaction process@xcite .",
    "since pions and nucleons originating from the decay of baryon resonances near the surface of the reaction system can escape without any further interaction , the number of resonances extracted from the experiments therefore reflects the time - integrated emission of resonances in the reaction .",
    "pions are the most copiously produced particles in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . it was predicted that the existence of a mixed phase of quarks and hadronic matter might result in a plateau - like behaviour of the excitation function of the pion multiplicity in central heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",
    "further , the creation of a large entropy due to the formation of the qgp was expected to increase the average pion multiplicity@xcite as the beam energy increases across the transition energy , leading to a bump or shoulder in the pion multiplicity distribution@xcite .",
    "we study in the following the average pion multiplicity as a function of the beam momentum . in both fermi s statistical model for particle production at high energies@xcite and landau s",
    "relativistic adiabatic hydrodynamics model@xcite , the average pion multiplicity per participant nucleon has been found to scale with the function @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the center - of - mass energy of a nucleon - nucleon collision . large deviations from this scaling might thus indicate the occurrence of exotic processes@xcite . to take into account the threshold behaviour , gazedzicki and rhrich",
    "have recently modified the scaling function to the following form @xmath69 and investigated the scaling behaviour in both nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and central nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions from bevalac energies up to cern energies@xcite .",
    "their extracted @xmath70 data for nn and aa collisions are shown in fig .",
    "10 by open squares and filled circles , respectively .",
    "the first three points for aa collisions are from the bevalac data , the two points at @xmath71 are from the dubna data and the highest two points are extracted from the ags data .",
    "although several extrapolations and assumptions about the centrality have been used in extracting the experimental information , it is interesting to see that the pion multiplicity in both nn and aa collisions scales with the fermi - landau variable @xmath72 .",
    "the large difference between the two cases is probably due to the large pion reabsorption in aa collisions .",
    "our predictions from the transport model are shown by the open circles .",
    "they seem to scale with @xmath72 and are actually very close to the extracted data for aa .",
    "since it is still not easy to pin down the origin of the small difference between the calculated results and the extracted data for aa , more data between @xmath72=0.4 and 1.7 to be available from the e895 and e866 collaboration will certainly enable us to make a more detailed study on the scaling behaviour of the pion multiplicity .",
    "based on the relativistic transport model ( art 1.0 ) we have studied several excitation functions in central au+au reactions at beam momenta from 2 to 12 gev / c . we have found that the maximum energy density increases with the beam energy and becomes higher than the estimated qgp transition density at about 8 gev / c .",
    "the calculated maximum baryon and energy densities are in good agreement with predictions of the relativistic hydrodynamics assuming the formation of shock waves in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a high degree of stopping can be achieved in the whole beam momentum range .",
    "we have predicted that starting at beam momentum of about 2 gev / c the strength of the nucleon transverse flow decreases but then saturates when the beam momentum is higher than about 7 gev / c .",
    "also the strength of the radial flow is found to first increase as a function of beam momentum and then saturates .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed the excitation function for the relative abundance of the resonance matter .",
    "the excitation function for the pion multiplicity has also been discussed in terms of the fermi - landau scaling variable .",
    "we have found that the pion multiplicity indeed scales with the fermi - landau scaling variable in the whole energy range studied here .",
    "the calculated pion multiplicities are very close to the existing data .",
    "these results can be used as a baseline in searching for new physics phenomena that may appear due to chiral symmetry restoration and/or quark - gluon - plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions at brookhaven s ags .",
