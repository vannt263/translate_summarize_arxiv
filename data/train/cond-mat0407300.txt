    "luminescent energy transfer in polymers is an important phenomenon .",
    "luminescent markers are used both for probing the intrinsic polymer dynamics , and for probing the properties of the environment using polymers . however , the theory of such dynamical phenomena is to no extent satisfactory .",
    "the problem here is the complicated nonmarkovian dynamics of the system , where the most interesting phenomena take place on the time - scales on which the systems shows strong memory effects .",
    "even the corresponding initial condition problem is hard to solve .",
    "no satisfactory quantitative theory exists at present for the stationary case .",
    "let us start from formulating the problem , and discuss the simplest energy transfer model , which will be used throughout the article .",
    "let us assume that the ends of a polymer are marked by a donor and an acceptor monomers .",
    "the molecule is under constant irradiation at a resonant probe frequency , so that the donor can get excited with probability @xmath0 per unit time ( we consider @xmath0 as effective intensity of the irradiation ) .",
    "the relaxation of the excited state due to spontaneous emission , as well as nonlinear effects connected with possible multiple excitation are neglected , so that the only mechanism of relaxation is the donor - acceptor energy transfer .",
    "we assume that the corresponding energy transfer is accompanied by emission of a photon with the frequency different from one of the irradiating light .",
    "this transfer takes place when donor and acceptor approach each other at distance @xmath1 , hereafter called reaction radius .",
    "physically , two situations may take place : being in vicinity of the acceptor the donor still can be excited , and immediately emits a photon at the observation frequency .",
    "another situation is the one when , being close to the acceptor , the donor gets out of resonance with the probe and can not be excited . in this case , the donor - acceptor system may be in one of the two states , _ on _ and _ off _ ; being in the _ on_-state the system may be excited with probability @xmath2 per unit time , and emits the photon under the transition into the _ off_-state . in what follows the expressions _ on _ and _ off _ will be simply used for denoting states in which the end - to - end distance is above and below the reaction radius @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the overall situation might seem simple , however it is much more complicated than the case of irreversible cyclization @xcite and is extremely awkward for theoretical investigation , even in the absence of flow .",
    "our knowledge about the reaction kinetics under flow is sporadic even for simpler reactions , see @xcite .",
    "the whole problem would be easily solvable if the life time distributions in the _ on_- and the _ off_-states were known .",
    "then the probability to be excited being in the _ on_-state and therefore the intensity of the emitted light could be easily calculated .",
    "the probabilities to be in the either state are connected with the level - crossing properties of the random process @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the instantaneous end - to - end distance of the polymer . as for all diffusive processes",
    ", however , the level - crossing process by @xmath3 shows a fractal structure , so that the mean time between two such crossings is zero ( this follows immediately from the rice formula for level crossing density and from the form of the two - time correlation function of the end - to - end distances , say , for a rouse polymer , which function lacks the second derivative at zero ) . again , as for all diffusive processes , this leads to a  tremor  in which @xmath3 crosses the @xmath1-level may times until it leaves and performs a long excursion to either side .",
    "tremor  is due to the fact that the diffusion approximation ( wiener process ) used in the description of the chain ( for example through the rouse - like langevin dynamics ) does not adequately mirror a short - time dynamics of whatever physical system @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of this theoretical problem does to no extent require for the change of the model ( say , by introducing underdamped dynamics , as proposed in @xcite ) since the physical problem at hand does not depend on the too - small time behavior of the @xmath3-process . indeed , this process is randomly sampled at times @xmath4 given by a poissonian flow of photons following with the rate @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath3 at times much smaller than @xmath5 thus can not be sampled and can physically play no role : this statement is a close analogue of the nyquist s sampling theorem .",
    "thus , the absence of the life - time distributions is not a problem of our theoretical model , but a problem of standard mathematical tools which rely too much on unphysical , but absolutely unimportant short - time properties of a wiener process .",
    "therefore in what follows we concentrate on the numerical investigation of the proposed model , and consider the intensity of stationary luminescence of the polymer @xmath6 under constant irradiation .",
    "we discuss the rouse model without hydrodynamic interactions , as well as the role of hydrodynamic interaction between the monomers , and consider the case when the polymer molecule undergoes deformation in a ( weak enough ) shear flow , which does not however cause the full stretching of the molecule .",
    "this situation is especially interesting as the case when the stationary luminescence of diluted polymer solution can be used as a probe for the flow structure .",
    "authors are not aware of any experimental realizations of such visualization method , thus our theoretical study might serve as a proof - of - principle for such immediate flow diagnostics method .",
    "let us start from discussing our numerical algorithm .",
    "our simulations consist of two independent parts : the simulation of the @xmath3-trajectories , which are then stored with high enough resolution , and their analysis giving the steady - state luminescence intensity .",
    "the reason for this approach is that one realization of the process can then be used for getting @xmath7 for a variety of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the model , so that the most time - consuming part of the simulation has to be done only once for exactly the time necessary to get enough statistics .",
    "let us concentrate first of the last part of the problem , namely on the evaluation of the stationary luminescence intensity for a given realization of @xmath3-process . from the record of",
    "the @xmath3 ( time resolution of stored data has to be much smaller than the minimal @xmath5 used in simulations ) we define the @xmath1-crossings of the process and , for given @xmath1 , obtain the lengths of _ on_- and _ off_-intervals , which are ordered and stored .",
    "according to the poisson statistics , the probability not to get excited during the _ on_-interval of duration @xmath8 is exactly @xmath9 , thus the probability to emit light after the _ on_-excursion is equal to @xmath10 . since the intensity of emitted light is proportional to the overall number of the intervals during which the system made a transition into its excited state , we have for the model where the _ off_-state is not excitable : @xmath11    \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 numbers the _",
    "on_-intervals , @xmath13 is their overall number , which depends on the reaction radius @xmath1 and on the overall time of simulations @xmath14 . equation ( [ eq1 ] ) shows that the intervals of very small duration are sampled with the probability proportional to their lengths so that , as anticipated , the fractal structures in vicinity of the concentration points of the level - crossings are not resolved and play no role . using eq.([eq1 ] ) it is possible to scan the whole range of intensities @xmath0 within one run , which is necessary to detect nonlinear effects .",
    "the situation in which , being in the _",
    "off_-state , the molecule immediately emits light , can be taken into account by adding the corresponding intensity to the expression given by eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability to be in the _",
    "off_-state , i.e. the overall relative time spent below @xmath1 .",
    "for example , for the case without flow , it is simply a function of relative reaction radius @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mean end - to - end squared distance for the chain , @xmath19 since this simply corresponds to adding a linear function of @xmath0 to the results for the _ on - off _ model , we concentrate in what follows only on these results , given by eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "this result holds for all situations without flow .",
    "in the situation with flow and with hydrodynamic interactions , it is hard to get the analytical expression for @xmath16 .",
    "the numerical results following from our simulations are presented in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "we start from the rouse chain as the simplest model for a polymer @xcite .",
    "a rouse chain is a set of @xmath20 beads ; each one , except for the two end beads , is connected to two neighbors by a harmonic potential , so that the overall potential energy of the system reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the harmonic spring constant and @xmath23 corresponds to the position of the @xmath12-th bead .",
    "the end beads are connected only to one neighbor .",
    "the equation of motion of the chain corresponds to overdamped motion under the influence of thermal fluctuations : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the friction parameter and @xmath26 is a zero - mean white noise obeying the fluctuation - dissipation relation , @xmath27 in thermal equilibrium , the following relations following immediately from the canonical distribution have to hold independently on the model ( and are always checked numerically as a proof of the quality of the simulation ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total energy , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the bead - to - bead and end - to - end distances , respectively .",
    "we also now apply a shear flow to the system , @xmath32 .",
    "the shear flow is implemented in eqs.([beaddyn ] ) by including a term @xmath33 for the motion in the @xmath34-coordinate of each bead _ i _ , @xmath35 the characteristic intensity of the flow necessary to compare its effects on the chain s conformation in different situations is given by the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the rouse time @xcite .",
    "the situation under hydrodynamic interactions is much more involved .",
    "the standard approaches @xcite are very accurate but slow , so that we prefer an approximate perturbative one .",
    "the quality of the corresponding approximations is checked by calculating two thermodynamically fixed parameters of the chain in quiescent solvent : its mean end - to - end distance and the overall energy .",
    "we anticipate that especially the end - to - end distance in the chain was found to be extremely sensitive to improper incorporation of the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "we confined ourselves to the situations under which the first order of the perturbation theory was found sufficient .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions among the beads are modeled within the zimm scheme @xcite .",
    "the zimm model is based on the rouse chain model but the equations of motion for different beads are coupled to each other not only through elastic forces but also through hydrodynamic forces .",
    "such coupling is a long - range one and is introduced through the oseen tensor @xcite , that is a @xmath38 tensor defined for each pair of beads ( _ i_-_j _ ) , @xmath39   \\\\ { \\mathcal{h}}_{ii } & = & \\frac{1}{\\gamma } { \\mathcal{i}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a unit matrix , @xmath41 is a unit vector @xmath42 in the direction of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is its transpose .",
    "the viscosity parameter @xmath45 can be expressed through @xmath25 and the bead s size @xmath46 since for @xmath47 one has @xmath48 .",
    "then , @xmath49 .\\ ] ] in what follows we use @xmath50 .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath12-th bead thus reads :      the noises @xmath52 acting on different beads are now not independent , otherwise the fluctuation - dissipation theorem would be violated .",
    "one often writes the corresponding equation of motion in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath55 matrix with the diagonal elements being unity ( in the units where @xmath50 ) and with the nondiagonal elements denoting the oseen terms between the corresponding components of velocity of different beads , and the matrix @xmath56 is defined through @xmath57 .",
    "the elements of the vector @xmath58 are now independent , zero mean gaussian white noises .",
    "actually , the computation of the equations of motions in the euler scheme reads , @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the forces due to the harmonic springs for the _ i_-th bead in the @xmath61 axis and @xmath62 are the corresponding components of @xmath58 .",
    "the computation of @xmath63 can be performed exactly by diagonalizing @xmath54 .",
    "this exact diagonalization requires an extremely high computational cost for long chains .",
    "the widely used method based on the orthogonal polynomials decomposition ( which gives very exact results ) is still too slow to get the runs long enough for our purposes .",
    "therefore we decided for a simple approximate approach based on the perturbation expansion of the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "since in the thermal equilibrium the averages @xmath67 being the internal energy and @xmath68 ( also being a thermodynamical quantity following immediately from equipartition ) are not modified by the dissipative coupling introduced by the oseen tensor , we can numerically check the validity of the approximations for @xmath63 for different @xmath46 values .",
    "we see that @xmath18 is extremely sensitive to incorrect incorporation of the hydrodynamic interaction , and its calculation is used as a probe of the quality of the approximation , see tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the data for rouse model give us typical error bars for the simulation of the exact model on the same scale .",
    "looking at the tables 1 and 2 , one can conclude that for @xmath46 up to @xmath69 , the second order approximation is sufficient , and for @xmath46 up to @xmath70 , the first order approximation ( much shorter simulations ) is accurate enough . in the case",
    "@xmath71 also the second order gets insufficient .",
    "thus , in our simulations we restrict ourselves to @xmath72 .",
    "we use a second order runge - kutta method to solve eqs.([eqsdyn ] ) with a sufficiently small time step @xmath73 . for the results shown in this paper we run @xmath74 iterations up to a maximum time @xmath75 for a full trajectory needed for adequate statistics .",
    "an initial thermalization period of @xmath76 time units is performed in all cases in order to start the trajectories from a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "compaq alphaserver hpc320 _ used to run these simulations requires about @xmath77 hours of cpu time for @xmath78 when the first order approximation scheme is chosen .",
    "the second perturbative order requires more than @xmath79 hours of cpu time for the same number of iterations and chain length .",
