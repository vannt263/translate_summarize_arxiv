    "hadronic transitions between baryon states represent a wide field of physical phenomena to be understood ultimately on the basis of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of strong interactions .",
    "while there is a wealth of experimental data available , theory lags behind with regard to a comprehensive explanation .",
    "this is mainly due to the persisting difficulties of solving qcd rigorously in the low- and intermediate - energy regimes .",
    "there one has to resort to effective theories or models based as far as possible on the genuine properties of qcd .",
    "furthermore , they should provide a comprehensive framework covering also other hadron phenomena ( e.g. , interactions with electroweak probes etc . ) .",
    "the quark - model description of light and strange baryons has seen a number of interesting and important new developments over the last few years .",
    "in addition to the traditional constituent - quark model ( cqm ) , whose hyperfine interaction derives from one - gluon exchange ( oge )  @xcite , alternative types of cqms have been suggested such as the ones based on instanton - induced ( ii ) forces  @xcite or goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) dynamics  @xcite . the gbe cqm  @xcite aims at incorporating the basic properties of low - energy qcd , as following from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath4s ) .",
    "properties of baryon resonances should be calculated in a fully relativistic approach . in this paper ,",
    "the theory is formulated along relativistic , i.e. poincar - invariant , quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we adhere to its point - form version  @xcite , since this allows to calculate observables in a manifestly covariant manner  @xcite .",
    "this approach is a - priori distinct from a field - theoretic treatment .",
    "it relies on a relativistically invariant mass operator with the interactions included according to the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite . in this way",
    "all the required symmetries of special relativity can be fulfilled .",
    "relativistic cqms have already been applied in the description of electroweak nucleon form factors   and electric radii as well as magnetic moments of all octet and decuplet baryon ground states  @xcite . in this context",
    "the point - form approach has turned out surprisingly successful .",
    "here we are interested if an analogous treatment of strong decays also leads to a satisfactory description of this type of hadronic reactions , in agreement with existing experimental data .",
    "mesonic resonance decays have always been considered as a big challenge , with early attempts dating back to the sixties  . with the refinement of cqms over the years more studies on different aspects of mesonic decays",
    "have been performed . in the course of the past two decades a number of valuable insights",
    "have thus been gained by various groups , e.g. , in refs .  .",
    "in the focus of interest have been , notably , the performance of various cqms as well as the adequacy of different decay operators for the mechanism of meson creation / emission . despite the considerable efforts invested one has still not yet arrived at a satisfactory microscopic explanation especially of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonance decays .",
    "also complementary attempts outside the cqm approach have not succeeded much better with hadron decays , and more generally , with providing a comprehensive working model of low - energy hadronic physics based on qcd .",
    "this situation is rather unsatisfactory from the theoretical side , especially in view of the large amount of experimental data accumulated over the past years and the ongoing high - quality measurements at such facilities as jlab , mami and others ( for a an overview of the modern developments see the proceedings of the recent @xmath5 workshops  @xcite ) .    up till now",
    ", specifically the gbe cqm has already been put to some tests in calculating mesonic decays of resonances of light and strange baryons in a semi - relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "these studies have revealed that relativistic effects have a big influence on the results , both in an elementary - emission and a quark - pair - creation model of the decay operator . in the present work",
    ", we now perform a covariant calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay modes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances . at this instance",
    ", we use a rather simplified model for the decay operator .",
    "our primary goal has been to set up a fully relativistic ( covariant ) cqm formulation of mesonic decays ; later on one may still improve on the decay operator .",
    "in particular , we assume a decay operator in the point - form spectator model ( pfsm ) with a pseudo - vector coupling .",
    "it has been seen in previous studies that such an operator includes effective many - body contributions due to the symmetry requirements of poincar invariance ( especially in order to satisfy translational invariance of the transition amplitude )  @xcite .",
    "we produce the corresponding predictions for decay widths from the gbe cqm and analogous results from a cqm with a oge hyperfine interaction , namely , the relativistic version of the bhaduri - cohler - nogami cqm  @xcite as parametrized in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition a comparison is provided with results from the ii cqm obtained with a similar ( spectator - model ) decay operator in a bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic results are also contrasted to several nonrelativistic and so - called semirelativistic calculations .",
    "partially , preliminary results have already been presented in proceedings contributions  @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we outline the theory for a covariant calculation of the mesonic decay widths from a relativistic cqm . in sects .",
    "[ sec : results ] and  [ sec : comparison ] we present the results of our calculation and discuss their qualitative and quantitative features with a comparison to decay calculations along other models and/or approaches . in the appendix some details of the relativistic point - form calculation of mesonic baryon decays are given .",

    "the total decay width one has to average over the initial and to sum over the final spin - isospin projections .    in nonrelativistic calculations",
    "the strong decays of hadron resonances are treated with a transition amplitude that is not lorentz - invariant .",
    "consequently , one is left with an arbitrary choice of the phase - space factor  @xcite . in the rest frame of the decaying resonance , either a purely nonrelativistic form , @xmath10 or the relativistic form ,",

    "the quantities with tilde represent some effective ( parametrized ) masses .",
    "clearly , the particular choice of the phase - space factor has a pronounced effect on the final results .",
    "the ambiguity concerning the phase - space factor is immediately resolved by imposing relativistic invariance on the formalism .",
    "this can evidently be done either along a relativistic field theory or in relativistic ( poincar - invariant ) quantum mechanics .    in the present work",
    "we formulate a poincar - invariant description of the decay amplitude . out of the possible forms of relativistic dynamics minimally affected by interactions  @xcite we make",
