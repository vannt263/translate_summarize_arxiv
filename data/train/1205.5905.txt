    "radio galaxies and radio loud quasars are believed to have a significant impact on the evolving universe and its large scale structure @xcite .",
    "they are often found in galaxy groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "since their jets inject a significant amount of energy into the surrounding medium , stored in the so - called radio lobes , they can provide useful information in the study of the density and evolution of the intergalactic and intracluster medium .",
    "the jet activity is also believed to regulate the growth of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore the estimation of the kinetic power and specification of the environments of these powerful radio sources at various cosmological epochs is an important task .",
    "the intracluster medium can be explored with the use of x - ray observations up to @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand radio galaxies",
    "are found at @xmath2 and beyond ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence they can provide a valuable insight into the high - redshift universe . moreover ,",
    "complete catalogues of radio galaxies and quasars indicate that these sources were of higher number density during the so - called ` quasar era ' @xcite , and since they can be observed at high redshifts the knowledge of the fundamental aspects of these sources as a population is of importance for cosmological studies .",
    "@xcite divided the extragalactic large scale radio sources into two main classes , namely low luminosity fr  i and more luminous fr  ii types .",
    "sources of the two classes are morphologically different , fr  is are core - jet bright , edge - darkened objects and contain presumably turbulent jets , while fr  iis are limb - brightened , often symmetrical objects with well defined features such as jets , hotspots and radio lobes ; the latter are often referred to as classical double radio sources .",
    "the question of whether they originate from the same parent population but are dependent on the environment they reside in , or whether they are intrinsically different , is still open ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of their relatively simple structure ( contrary to the turbulent nature of fr  is ) , some sophisticated semi - analytical models of fr  iis growth have been developed .",
    "these models can predict source observables , that is radio lobe luminosity ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the observed frequency ) and linear source size ( @xmath5 ) , from underlying physical properties such as kinetic luminosity ( @xmath6 ) , source age ( @xmath7 ) , and the density of the intergalactic medium ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this has led to a number of studies that investigated whole populations of these powerful sources and their evolution @xcite .",
    "the basic methodology of these studies was to construct virtual populations of fr  ii sources choosing underlying properties for the population and running them through semi - analytical models to predict the distribution of source observables , the linear size and radio lobe luminosity .",
    "the virtual populations were further compared to observed data from complete samples of radio sources . however , those studies focused on the commonly used radio power  linear size ( @xmath9 ) distribution diagram introduced by @xcite .",
    "one of the major problems with such an analysis is that @xmath9 diagram is difficult to interpret in terms of most commonly used techniques to study source populations such as the luminosity function .",
    "moreover , many studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) focused predominantly on the relationship between the observables and their trends with cosmological epochs .",
    "these observables are determined by the fundamental source properties , and hence they carry convolved effects of possible cosmological evolution of the underlying physical properties , as well as the influence of observational biases .",
    "although , there have been attempts to investigate the fundamental source parameter space @xcite , sometimes very strong assumptions have been adopted .    in this paper",
    "we use the standard monte carlo method , as summarized above , to generate virtual populations of fr  ii sources .",
    "however , contrary to previous studies , we use distributions of radio lobe luminosity that can easily be transformed into radio luminosity functions , rather than the @xmath9 diagram consistently used in previous semi - analytical population studies , to compare the simulated population and the observed data .",
    "also , we attempt to make as few assumptions as possible about the underlying physical source properties to obtain more general results ( although we are still restricted by computing time ) . to do so we repeat the monte carlo simulation multiple times following grid minimisation that searches broad ranges of the possible source underlying properties .",
    "this allows us to create confidence intervals of the estimated parameters .",
    "in addition , as has not been done before , we allow for co - evolution of the physical source properties ; this will enable us to determine the dominant type of evolution , if any .",
    "further , we investigate the influence of various assumptions , such as the density profile characteristics or the jet particle content , on the best - fitting properties of source populations .",
    "the method we develop here allows us to constrain the parent population of the sources while minimising the inevitable effects of the radio surveys flux limits .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the observed samples are presented and discussed in ",
    "[ sec : obs - data ] , and in  [ sec : theory ] we summarize the theoretical models used .",
    "the construction of the simulated samples and statistical methods used are discussed in detail in  [ sec : mc - modelling ] .",

    "we use complete flux - limited radio samples which contain all extragalactic radio sources in a given sky area and above the sensitivity limit specified for each survey .",
    "currently , we concentrate only on sources of the fr  ii morphology due to the availability of semi - analytical models of their time evolution ; however , the approach presented here may be extended to cover the whole radio source population once theoretical models for fr  is are developed .",
    "we use both radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars as it is assumed , following the unification models , that the only difference between these types of sources is just their viewing angle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , due to the sparse population of sources at high redshifts , and hence poor representation , we limit our analysis to sources with redshifts up to @xmath10 . due to the nature of the theoretical models that assume that most of the radio luminosity comes from the radio lobes of the sources , one should use samples observed at low radio frequencies ( @xmath11  mhz ) to avoid compact radio emission that dominates at ghz frequencies .",
    "there are few commonly used low - frequency radio catalogues . in this paper , we present the work done with two such radio samples , namely the well known third cambridge revised revised catalogue @xcite , and the complete radio sample of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter brl ) .     is drawn in black , @xmath12 in blue , and @xmath13 in green .",
    "each of the redshift bins is further divided in size bins , where solid lines ( filled circles ) correspond to smallest sources , dashed ( open triangles ) to medium size sources , and dotted ( open square lozenges ) to giant sources ( see  [ sec : obs - data ] for the exact values).,width=264 ]    the 3crr radio sample is very shallow ( its flux limit equals @xmath14  jy defined at @xmath15  mhz ) , but covers a large area of the sky ( @xmath16  sr ) ; it contains some of the most powerful radio galaxies .",

    "in the case of both samples the measured radio spectral index of each source is used .",
    "the redshift distribution of all sources included in our analysis is presented in figure  [ rys : lum - red - plane ] .",
    "further , the population is divided into size and luminosity bins in given redshift ranges . due to the number of available sources from the catalogues we are only able to consider three redshift ranges , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the borders of which are chosen to ensure similar source numbers per redshift bin .",
    "incidentally , these redshift ranges span over similar relative light travel time intervals , i.e. @xmath29  gyr , @xmath30  gyr and @xmath31  gyr .",
    "these subgroups of different redshifts are considered separately unless otherwise stated .",
    "sources are grouped in size bins in the following manner : in @xmath32 the size ranges are @xmath33  kpc , @xmath34  kpc  @xmath35  mpc and @xmath36  mpc , in @xmath12 these are @xmath37  kpc , @xmath38  kpc  @xmath35  mpc and @xmath36  mpc , and in @xmath13 @xmath39  kpc , @xmath40  kpc  @xmath35  mpc and @xmath36  mpc .",
    "the size ranges were chosen to contain similar number of sources in the case of the smallest and medium sized sources , while the last bin tracks giant radio galaxies more accurately ( giant radio galaxies are defined as sources of total linear sizes of more than 1  mpc ) . for each of these size bins",
    "a radio lobe luminosity distribution is constructed .",
    "the distribution is constructed at at an observing frequency of 178  mhz from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in steps of @xmath43 .",
    "such a division of the population allows us to track the relative number of the sources with a given size , and later to construct radio luminosity functions of the sources at the given redshift ranges and of the given sizes .",
    "the counts of sources used are summarized in table  [ tab : obs - data ] , and their observed radio luminosity functions are presented in figure  [ rys : obs - rlf ] .    as pointed out by brw the use of only one radio sample in any population study may result in inevitable biases while interpreting results .",
    "this is due to the strong luminosity ",
    "redshift ( @xmath44 ) dependence ( figure  [ rys : lum - red - plane ] ) .",
    "it is important , therefore , to either include a few radio samples that will supplement each other in the radio lobe luminosity  redshift plane , or to be very cautious with interpreting results . for the extensive discussion on this and also frequency related issues",
    "we refer our reader to the original brw paper .",
    "commonly used catalogues include 6ce @xcite and 7crs ( based on the seventh cambridge redshift survey catalogue , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) besides 3crr ( e.g. brw , * ? ? ?",
    ". the brl sample has also been used along with the other three by @xcite . however , here , we do not attempt to reconstruct the previous population studies of the [ @xmath45 plane , but rather analyse binned distributions of the sources radio lobe luminosities , hence we present work on only two samples . because of considerably different flux limits of various samples , other ones such as 7crs will be analysed separately to 3crr and brl .",
    "we assume a flat universe with the hubble constant of @xmath46 km  s@xmath47  mpc@xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 throughout the paper .",
    "a basic picture of the fr  ii type radio source growth , where the relativistic plasma is ejected in two opposite directions forming collimated outflows , is nowadays widely accepted .",
    "these outflows expand and interact with the surrounding medium until they terminate in a strong shock and create so - called radio lobes where the excess transferred energy is stored .",
    "the idea first proposed by @xcite and @xcite has been developed , over the past 15 years , into a few more sophisticated models of the evolution of fr  ii sources .",
    "in particular , there are three models which have gained the most attention , ( * ? ? ? * , hereafter ka ) and subsequently ( * ? ? ? * , hereafter kda ) , brw , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mk ) .",
    "it is not our intent to compare the existing models in this paper ; however , we will briefly summarize their main features .",
    "the brw and mk models follow the dynamical evolution of radio sources as described by ka , which we will focus on .",
    "the density profile of the environment into which the source expands , is approximated by the generalised king ( @xcite ) profile    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the radial distance from the agn core , and @xmath52 is a constant central density within the core radius @xmath53 .",
    "the index @xmath54 is usually constrained by the observations , although some restrictions may apply in the case of certain assumptions ( e.g. the self - similarity assumption requires @xmath55 , see * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , that the model depends on the combination of @xmath56 and not the parameters separately .",
    "the approximation is valid at distances of at least a few core radii .",
    "further , as @xcite and ka show , the source expansion problem can be solved purely with a dimensional analysis where the source growth depends purely on the jet of the source with constant power ( @xmath6 , hereafter referred to as radio source kinematic luminosity ) , its age ( @xmath7 ) and the environment in which it self - similarly expands .",
    "the linear length of the lobe ( @xmath57 ) of the source is hence defined as    @xmath58    where the @xmath59 parameter depends solely on @xmath54 and the source aspect ratio @xmath60 ( i.e. the ratio of the source length to its width , see  [ sec : aspect - ratio ] ) . the lobe pressure ( @xmath61 ) of a radio source of a given age",
    "is further found with    @xmath62    to calculate the radio lobe luminosity the kda model incorporates the energy losses of the relativistic electrons , using the adiabatic expansion , synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
    "the radio lobe luminosity at a radio frequency @xmath4 ( note that @xmath63 ) of the source becomes therefore @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the injection spectral index of the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons (  [ sec : spectral - index ] ) , and the term @xmath66 depends on the energy losses and @xmath67 with @xmath68 being time at which a particle was injected into the radio lobe . for the full derivation and discussion see kda and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) .",
    "the brw and mk models differ from kda in their assumptions about the luminosity evolution of the sources determined by the way the relativistic particles are injected from the jet to the radio lobe , and the particle transport . in particular ,",
    "brw argue for the importance of the hotspot region pointing out the over - simplicity of the ka / kda model and its assumption of source self - similar expansion .",
    "additionally , brw assume that spectral index of the radio lobes at a specific time is driven by breaks in frequency in the head region .",
    "further , mk expands the kda and brw models incorporating the particle transport mechanisms .",
    "it is worth noting that assumptions of brw and mk lead to much steeper evolutionary tracks of the sources in the radio power ",
    "linear size ( @xmath69 ) plane as compared with the predictions of the kda model .",
    "more recently @xcite attempted to develop a more accurate model by testing and modifying the three leading theoretical models .",
    "they report that none of the existing models can give fully acceptable fits to all of the properties deduced from the radio surveys ( especially the synchrotron spectral index @xmath23 ) ; however , according to their findings ka / kda give the best overall results as compared to the other two models . in this work",
    "we employ the original ka / kda model .",
    "in the traditional and most common way , the radio source evolution has been investigated through the so - called @xmath69 diagram @xcite , which in recent studies has been extended into radio lobe spectral index ( @xmath23 ) and redshift ( @xmath70 ) parameter space . here",
    ", we use an alternative approach and instead of investigating [ @xmath71 space we use radio luminosity functions ( rlfs ) in the analysis .",
    "an advantage of doing so is the direct link to the results of other source population studies which are most commonly expressed in terms of luminosity or mass functions .    due to degeneracy between the fundamental properties it is impossible to infer the source kinetic luminosity , the central ambient density and the source age directly from the observables , and hence monte carlo simulations are necessary in order to generate simulated rlfs . in this section",
    "we present our monte carlo method (  [ sec : mc - sim ] ) .",
    "the parameter distribution functions and other fixed assumptions of the model for constructing the radio source population are discussed in  [ sec : distributions ] .",
    "the statistical methods used to determine confidence intervals and goodness - of - fit test are discussed in  [ sec : stats ] .      to construct a single virtual sample",
    "we generate , in total , virtual radio sources .",
    "the subsequent prescription is followed .    1 .   for each source of the virtual sample",
    "we assign a set of physical parameters summarized in table  [ tab : model - params ] .",
    "each of the parameters is either drawn from its respective distribution or is the same for each source ; the details of these physical ` input ' parameters are presented in  [ sec : distributions ] .",
    "2 .   based on the theoretical model of ka",
    "/ kda the source is evolved and its linear size @xmath5 is calculated .",
    "the linear size of the source is being checked for its reliability , that is whether the source expansion exceeds an assumed fraction of the light speed ( maximum allowed head advance speed , see  [ sec : adv - speed ] ) .",
    "if it does , the source is rejected .",
    "otherwise , the source is accepted and its linear size is corrected for the projection angle (  [ sec : dproj ] ) .",
    "4 .   the radio lobe luminosity @xmath3 of the source at a frequency @xmath72  mhz and its randomly generated redshift is calculated .",
    "5 .   the radio luminosity is subsequently randomized by adding a gaussian variable of standard deviation @xmath73 to account for any instrumental / systematic errors . moreover , since the source is evolved in its rest - frame , a correction of @xmath74 transforming the calculated radio luminosity to the common frequency must be included .",
    "the common frequency of @xmath75mhz is used .",
    "these corrections are discussed in detail in  [ sec : spectral - index ] .",
    "steps 1 - 5 are repeated times .",
    "the radio lobe luminosity histograms for each redshift range and linear size bin are generated as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : obs - data ] .",
    "the binning of the virtual sample histograms matches exactly the one used for the real observed data sample .",
    "however , to ensure that the probability density functions of kinetic luminosities ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : schech - stdn ] and eqn",
    ".  [ eqn : schech - wlt ] ) are represented by reasonable number of sources at the functions exponentially falling ends , we initially generate the virtual population assuming that their kinetic luminosities are drawn from a uniform distribution , and later a weighting factor is applied to each source ( see  [ sec : jetpow ] ) .",
    "8 .   at this stage",
    "the histograms represent the total number of sources in the simulated sample since we have not determined yet the fluxes of the generated sources . in this sense , those are the ` true ' numbers of the entire source population .",
    "however , to be able to compare the simulated sample to the observed data the selection effect arising from limited flux sensitivity must be taken into account .",
    "we achieve it by using radio luminosity functions .",
    "rlfs are an ideal tool when dealing with coupled selection effects such as limited sensitivity of radio surveys . they are defined as number density of sources per unit comoving volume per unit luminosity .",
    "the initial histogram of the entire simulated population is therefore transformed into rlf by using the survey volume @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the area of the sky that the survey covers , and @xmath79 represents the data counts in luminosity bins @xmath80 .",
    "further , the rlf is transformed back into a histogram of number of expected sources for each linear size and luminosity bin using @xmath81  a maximum co - moving volume in which a source in a given luminosity bin and with the flux limit of the survey would be included in the sample @xcite , @xmath82 the two transformations simplify to @xmath83 note that flux densities of the simulated radio galaxies ( @xmath84 ) are not examined directly , and hence no radio sources are rejected based on the limited sensitivity bias ( i.e. requirement that @xmath85 ) . instead , a correction factor ( @xmath86 ) , which indicates the probability of radio source occurrence at a given flux limit , is employed .",
    "the effect of the limited flux sensitivity is an average for each considered bin . to ensure greater accuracy we perform the flux correction on much finer bin widths than those of the final histograms . in particular , in this step we use @xmath87 times finer bins than used in the final histograms .",
    "these are later summed to match the initially constructed distributions .",
    "so far , we have not discussed the number of progenitors becoming active and turning into fr  ii sources . to ensure a reasonably good statistics ,",
    "our simulated sample is generated with a much larger number of virtual radio sources than the observed data sets contain .",
    "instead of introducing a corresponding distribution function we use the full simulated sample .",
    "however , since both the simulated and observed samples must be of a similar size , that is of a similar number of sources considered , we need to renormalize the data counts , which are found with eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sim - data - counts ] , in the virtual sample .",
    "we use the binned maximum likelihood method ( mlm , see  [ sec : mlm ] ) together with brent s method @xcite to do so .",
    "the normalization is set as a free parameter , but represents an average for the considered redshift range .",
    "finally , the goodness - of - fit test is performed .",
    "the statistics used , normalization of the sample and the goodness - of - fit test are discussed in  [ sec : stats ] .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of each generated source is drawn randomly from a distribution function that acts as a probability density function .",
    "the form of the distribution function of sources kinetic luminosities is not known , and various forms have been assumed in previous works ranging from a simple uniform distribution between minimum ( @xmath88 ) and maximum ( @xmath89 ) kinetic luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the index @xmath65 defines the slope of the energy density distribution , and hence determines the relative fraction of low and high energetic particles , where the flatter the distribution is the more energetic particles are included . although the change of @xmath65 may be significant for a single radio source , it does not seem to have a dramatic effect on the whole population of sources , and it is the low energy cut off that influences the average properties of the population .      as discussed in  [ sec : particle - content ] there is much debate on the particle content of the radio jets .",
    "initially , in our simulation we followed the conservative kda assumption ( @xmath147 ) , but to test the influence of this assumption on the whole population of sources we assumed the particle content of radio jet to be drawn from a uniform distribution in a range @xmath338 $ ] , and further also @xmath339 $ ] .",

    "indeed , the addition of protons in the relativistic jets would require these particles , similarly to electrons , to be accelerated to the relativistic speeds .",
    "as already shown by e.g. @xcite , relativistic protons store much more energy than electrons typically do , and this in turn will give rise to the radio source kinetic luminosity .",
    "the argument may be turned around : to maintain the expected kinetic luminosity , the observed radio lobe luminosity is much lower for proton dominated jets than for lightweight , electron - positron jets ( see also kda ) . however , many authors favour proton - electron jets .",
    "@xcite , for instance , draw a hypothesis that some low - luminosity agn have proton dominated jets , which are supported by extracting energy from black hole spin .",
    "@xcite report that jets of radio - loud quasars are also most likely heavy due to the positron - electron kinetic energy being too small to support energetics of radio lobes .",

    "this is not required by positron - electron jets ( see  [ sec : assump - disc - m - lorentz ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if one considers the net effect of the two assumptions tested , that is the jet particle content and the minimum lorentz factor , one will notice that their effects may cancel out . setting @xmath343 or",
    "more one ensures that only initially highly relativistic particles are included in the jet material and these are later being re - accelerated in the jet front ; it requires stronger momentum flux to affect the nonrelativitic protons than relativistic ones , hence the change in kinetic luminosity in these two cases .",

    "we find that for our hardwired maximum head advance speed of @xmath151 a source of 1  mpc in size may live for the maximum of @xmath352  yr , while to increase the total lifetime to @xmath353  yr , the source head advance speed would have to be of order of @xmath354 .",
    "such a low head advance speed may be treated as a lower limit because the jet must be supersonic during the sources lifetime to maintain the fr  ii morphology , and also classical double sources older than the inferred age are not observed .",
    "the model of @xcite predicts that the source advance speed changes , i.e. decreases , with the age of the source .",
    "this would suggest that sources that initially have high maximum head advance speed , slow down as they get older and hence they reach older ages and smaller @xmath106 are measured ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the radio samples we are currently using contain the most powerful fr  ii radio galaxies and quasars , and the bias originating from the flux limit is particularly strong at high redshifts .",
    "this causes us to observe only the youngest and most powerful sources .",
    "@xcite suggested an explanation of the noticeable decrease with redshift in source lifetimes . the term ` youth - redshift degeneracy ' has been coined to describe the effect . due to the luminosity - redshift degeneracy originating from the radio flux limits , at high redshifts",

    "they seem to be also of smaller linear sizes as compared to the radio galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the leading theoretical models of radio galaxy time evolution ( e.g. kda , brw ) predict a short initial phase of the radio source growth where the radio lobe luminosity peaks ( up to a @xmath355 few kpc ) , after which the radio lobe luminosity decreases as radio source ages and grows bigger . therefore , to be able to produce linear sizes and radio lobe luminosities as observed at high redshifts , the sources must be younger than their low redshift counterparts .",
    "based on the 3crr and brl samples our results indeed suggest a trend of the total radio source lifetimes decreasing with redshift .",

    "some may argue that environments of fr  ii sources may depend on the cosmological epoch .",
    "that is , beside the argument of the evolution following the expansion of the universe , at low redshifts weak clusters and galaxy groups are favoured by fr  ii sources , while rich galaxy clusters are preferred at high redshifts @xcite . if this is the case the effect will be convolved in the @xmath110 parameter resulting in evolution stronger than the expected @xmath380 .",

    "there are two main conclusions .",
    "firstly , the higher the redshift the more powerful the jets are that are included ; at @xmath382 the highest @xmath6 are of order @xmath383  w ( model s ) , while in the highest redshift range , @xmath13 , the most powerful sources seem to have jet luminosities reaching @xmath384  w ( figure  [ rys : klf ] ) . secondly , the larger the radio sources are the more powerful agn on average they host ( figure  [ rys : klf - frac - size ] ) .",
    "the second effect seems to be much milder than the dependence on redshift , but it is present ; a similar pattern has been already observed by @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ rys : klf ] and figure  [ rys : klf - frac - size ] , although the parent populations of model s and w are different , the predicted flux - limited samples of the two models are very similar .",
    "more interestingly , one would expect kinetic luminosities of sources of fr  ii type to be at least @xmath385  w. indeed , although we simulated sources of kinetic luminosities of @xmath386  w , these do not contribute to the observed populations .",
    "some consideration is also needed of the lowest redshift bin best fits for model w , where the kinetic luminosity break reaches somewhat low values and the slope is flatter compared to the other redshift ranges .",
    "the kinetic luminosity distribution function of model w has been used by @xcite as their initial kinetic luminosity distribution function but for the most powerful sources only . in their work",
    "the population of radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars was divided based on the emission line characteristics rather , that is high- and low - excitation sources ( heg and leg respectively ) , than the historical fr  i and fr  ii classes .",
    "heg include powerful fr  ii and the most powerful fr  i sources , while leg include most fr  is and low - luminosity fr  ii objects .",
    "as mentioned before model w may not be able to reproduce the faint end of the distribution .",
    "contrary to @xcite we do include low luminosity fr  iis and perhaps this is the cause of the observed shift of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the thin , dotted lines in figure  [ rys : klf - frac - size ] represent the possible parent populations generated according to the assumed distribution functions .",
    "the flux limit of the radio catalogues used is very high , and hence only the most powerful sources are observed ; as estimated by our simulations their kinetic luminosities do not drop below @xmath387  w. in such a strong flux limit regime either of the kinetic luminosity distribution functions ( models s and w ) will shape the faint power end of the luminosity functions on the basis of a good fit to the high power end .",
    "however , with the lack of observed sources with @xmath388  w the faint end of the function is highly unconstrained especially at higher redshifts where , given currently used radio samples , only the most powerful sources are considered . to investigate this issue we attempted to fit pre- and post- kinetic luminosity break slopes separately . to do this",

    "* ) , and allowed the pre - break slope to vary .",
    "the results , while assuming the curved power - law as the initial distribution function of source kinetic luminosities , are in good agreement with those found with the model s. the faint end of the kinetic luminosity function is well constrained in the lowest redshift range , but since now it is not dependent on the high power end of the function it becomes highly unconstrained at higher redshifts .",

    "furthermore , since the growth of the black hole and its kinetic luminosity may be linked , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the kinetic energy density of these active galaxies undergoes a similar cosmological evolution such that the most powerful jets are found at earlier epochs .",

    "the results of the independent-@xmath70 fits already suggest a redshift evolution of the kinetic luminosity break .",

    "energy extraction from black hole spin is an attractive way to explain high jet luminosities and efficiencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after @xcite we note that where @xmath427 denotes the black hole spin , and @xmath428 is the poloidal magnetic field . in such a case , for a given kinetic luminosity",
    "the higher the spin is , the less massive the black hole must be .",
    "however , one must bear in mind that the strength of the poloidal magnetic field will have a direct effect on the efficiency of the black hole rotational energy extraction ( for discussion on this issue see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a combination of accretion and spin may play a significant role in producing the kinetic luminosities estimated here .",
    "however , our results suggest that also environments and lifetimes of radio galaxies have a direct influence on the radio luminosity of large scale structures of radio galaxies .",
    "it is worth considering , therefore , whether it is possible to reduce the redshift evolution in @xmath92 based on the interplay between the environments and radio galaxy lifetimes in our results .",
    "for instance , the @xmath92 cosmological evolution of @xmath429 will yield milder evolution of the radio source maximum lifetimes , @xmath430 , and the trend with redshift of the galaxy cluster central densities can be as strong as @xmath431 ( model s ) or even @xmath432 ( model w ) . with this pattern of cosmological evolution the kinetic luminosity break would reach @xmath433  w at @xmath434 , which further implies maximum black hole masses of @xmath435  m@xmath413 if the sources accrete close to their eddington luminosity , and jets are predominantly accretion powered .",
    "however , this causes @xmath110 to be unfeasibly strong .",
    "one may get more realistic results while assuming @xmath436 , as then our results show that @xmath437 and @xmath438 , which leads to @xmath439  w , @xmath440  yr , and @xmath441 ( model s ) .",
    "the redshift evolution of the central densities may seem to be rather high , since at @xmath442 it would exceed the effect from the universe s expansion ; however , as discussed in  [ sec : res - density ] such a strong evolution may be realistic if some intrinsic change in the environments , or other effect such as evolution of core radius , take place .",
    "alternatively , radio sources may be allowed to reach older ages than the ones found with the best - fitting parameters ( but kept within the confidence intervals as found in this work ) . to lower the kinetic luminosities",
    "the sources would have to be younger or reside in higher density environments than our best - fitting parameters suggest , or undergo a combination of the two effects .",
    "for instance , if one attempts to match the kinetic luminosities and ages estimated by @xcite for 3crr sources , the lifetimes would have to be allowed to reach @xmath443  yr , and hence sources would have to reside in very high density environments .",
    "finally , there is a possibility that , contrary to what we assumed so far , the intrinsic source parameters are not independent .",
    "scenarios where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and/or @xmath7 and @xmath60 are correlated are sometimes considered , but are beyond the scope of our current work .",
    "it is necessary to point out that as the cosmological evolution of the source parameters is certainly real and is not an effect of an observational bias due to high flux limit of the observed samples , the location of the kinetic luminosity break can be only constrained in the highest redshift bin . from our results",
    "it seems that in the lower redshift bins the @xmath92 must be at the lower end of the luminosities that still contribute to reconstruction of the observed samples , but its exact location is uncertain ( figure  [ rys : klf - frac - size]).in addition , one may notice in figure  [ rys : klf - frac - size ] , that the independent-@xmath70 fits predict lower number density of sources than the combined-@xmath70 fits at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "the reason for this behaviour lies in tying the @xmath93 exponent of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : schech - stdn ] and eqn .",
    "[ eqn : schech - wlt ] in the case of the combined-@xmath70 fits , where @xmath93 is required to stay the same for all redshifts ( unlike for the independent-@xmath70 fits where the exponent may vary freely between redshift ranges ) .",
    "the best fits of both model s and w of the combined-@xmath70 fits predict much flatter slopes of the kinetic luminosity distributions than the independent-@xmath70 fits .",
    "this will cause the existence of low radio luminosity sources that are not observed due to the high flux limit of the samples , but are unveiled in the klfs .",
    "both of these issues this may be verified with larger samples with lower flux limits than are currently being used in this study .",
    "the black hole masses of massive elliptical galaxies , which are typical hosts of powerful radio galaxies , are known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , once number densities and kinetic luminosities of the sources have been estimated , one can set constraints on the agn duty cycle which defines the fraction of black holes being active at a particular cosmological epoch .    the duty cycle , @xmath444 ,",
    "is defined as    @xmath445    where @xmath446 is the space density of active agn with mass @xmath447 and at the redshift @xmath70 , while @xmath448 analogously defines the space density of all agn ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "since in our work other types of radio loud agn are excluded , e.g. fr  is and blazars , we shall refer to the duty cycle of fr  ii radio galaxies only in this discussion ; this will be denoted by @xmath449 .",
    "a typical fr  ii source can be assumed to have a black hole mass of @xmath450  m@xmath413 . if we assume that these are the most typical sources during each epoch ( i.e. there is no significant mass evolution ) , then the typical kinetic luminosity of these black holes is around the value of @xmath92 of the considered cosmological epoch .",
    "for the lowest redshifts , with @xmath451  w , the space number density is approximately @xmath452  dn  mpc@xmath453 ( figure  [ rys : klf ] ) ; @xmath446 is found analogously for the other two redshift bins .",
    "these values are compared with the local black hole mass functions compiled by @xcite , which give approximately @xmath454  dn  mpc@xmath455@xmath456 . assuming that , around @xmath457  m@xmath413 , the average fractional accretion rate and efficiency of conversion to kinetic power are independent of black hole mass",
    ", we can infer that @xmath458 .",
    "then , neglecting redshift - evolution of the black hole mass function , we find duty cycles of @xmath459 , @xmath460 , and @xmath461 .",
    "although in our analysis we use ranges of redshifts , the measurement is instantaneous , and hence can be compared to other results for a single redshift ; here our measurement will be an average for the redshifts within each range we consider .",
    "we can compare the estimated duty cycles with the maximum lifetimes of radio galaxies obtained from our fits to determine whether all or just a fraction of @xmath462  m@xmath413 black holes are likely to spend some time as a powerful fr  ii radio galaxy , where we define ` powerful ' to mean at the break luminosity , i.e. the most powerful ` typical ' objects in the observed epochs . from our fits , we found that the sources live for a maximum of approximately @xmath463  yr in our lowest redshift range , and since @xmath464  yr , then each radio galaxy is on for 1.6 per cent of this epoch , compared to a duty cycle of 0.1 per cent .",
    "if we assume that an agn goes though the fr  ii stage only once , if at all , during its lifetime , then around 10 per cent of ` typical ' radio galaxy hosts are likely to spend time as a powerful fr  ii in the most recent epoch . moreover , if we assume that these galaxies can go through their fr  ii episodes multiple times throughout this epoch , then the fraction will be even smaller .",
    "for the higher redshifts the inferred duty cycles are smaller as compared to the local universe . from the fits ,",
    "the radio sources at higher redshifts are found to live for a shorter time ; the lifetimes of @xmath465  yr for redshift range @xmath12 and @xmath466  yr for @xmath13 are found , while the time spanned by each epoch remains close to @xmath467 . however , the reduction in lifetimes is not sufficient to explain the drop in duty cycle at high redshifts : the most powerful fr  iis become rarer , and a smaller fraction of potential fr  ii hosts spend time as powerful fr  iis ( perhaps @xmath468  per cent for @xmath12 , and @xmath469  per cent for @xmath13 ) .",
    "these apparent reductions in duty cycle may result from our assumption of no evolution in the number density of @xmath462  m@xmath413 black holes from the present epoch .",
    "in fact , based on the evolution of x - ray luminosity functions , @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) estimate that the black hole number density of smbhs declines from @xmath470 to @xmath471 .",
    "this reduction in number density at higher redshifts could account for most of the apparent drop in duty cycle which we infer from our fits .",
    "it is also important to note that since the break luminosity of the kinetic luminosity function increases by 2 decades from @xmath32 to @xmath13 , the active fractions quoted here are tracing significantly different populations in terms of kinetic power , and if lower - power radio galaxies are included ( e.g. the fr  i population ) the total duty cycle of radio - loud agn may be much greater than the values given here .",
    "it is interesting to compare our estimates of powerful radio galaxy duty cycles with estimates of agn duty cycles based on radiative luminosity functions . in the higher redshift ranges , our duty cycle estimates are at least a decade lower than those inferred for @xmath462  m@xmath413 black holes by @xcite and the lower bounds estimated by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be understood in terms of the radio loud fraction of agn , since for the high kinetic powers observed at higher redshifts , the accretion rates are expected to be large fractions of the eddington rate and hence correspond to the underlying quasar population , which is known to be predominantly radio - quiet .",
    "hence at these redshifts , the lower duty cycle inferred from kinetic luminosities may reflect the small fraction of high accretion - rate , radio - loud objects .",
    "however , at lower redshifts , the situation turns around , and our inferred duty cycle for @xmath462  m@xmath413 may be up to a decade _ larger _ than that estimated from radiative luminosities by @xcite",
    ". this difference may reflect the evolution of the fr  ii kinetic break luminosity to lower values , which may correspond to a lower typical black hole mass at low redshifts than the @xmath462  m@xmath413 we assume here , for which the duty cycles predicted by @xcite are higher .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the reduction in break luminosity corresponds to a change to a lower accretion rate ( as a fraction of the eddington rate ) , where a kinetically - dominated accretion mode dominates over radiatively efficient accretion ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we perform multidimensional monte carlo simulations to investigate fundamental source parameters ( such as kinetic luminosity , age and ambient density ) , and their possible trends with redshift of powerful radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars of fr  ii morphology .",
    "we present a new method , based on radio luminosity functions , for estimating the parent populations of complete , flux limited radio samples . in our analysis",
    "we use the ka / kda semi - analytical model of fr  ii type radio source time evolution , and we stress that other models , such as those of brw , mk , or the modified models of @xcite , might yield somewhat different results .    we find that :    a.   the total lifetimes of the radio galaxies are found to be few @xmath472  yr at low redshift and decrease for earlier epochs .",
    "this is in agreement with independent studies on the 3crr radio sources , but may be specific to these most powerful radio galaxies and quasars . with the current sample and its strong flux limit we are unable to draw final statements about the evolution of the lifetimes of the sources which is suggested by our current results .",
    "b.   our results suggest cosmological evolution of one or more source parameters .",
    "in particular the mean density of the immediate source environments ( or the @xmath473 parameter if we allow core radius or @xmath54 to change with redshift ) is found to undergo evolution with redshift ; the hypothesis that there is no evolution is ruled out with probability of @xmath474 per cent . c.   the central density of the fr  ii environments is found to undergo redshift evolution of approximately @xmath475 ; evolution stronger than the one expected from the universe expansion is possible if we consider additional effects from change of environment or core radius evolution .",
    "d.   the function describing the initial distribution of kinetic luminosities modelled by the schechter function ( or its modification ) or smoothly broken power - law is favoured to simple power - law ; however , the hypothesis of an unbroken power - law distribution can not be ruled out at a confidence level of more than @xmath476 per cent .",
    "e.   the estimated kinetic luminosities are within @xmath477  w for fr  ii type sources , which is consistent with previous studies .",
    "we observe that the kinetic luminosities depend on the cosmological epoch and the linear size of the source , where larger in linear size as well as higher redshift sources are more powerful .",
    "f.   the fr  iis kinetic luminosity function undergoes cosmological evolution of the break luminosities of at least @xmath478 and may be as strong as @xmath479 .",
    "the uncertainty originates from the strong degeneracy between @xmath92 , @xmath98 and @xmath96 .",
    "evolution stronger than @xmath480 is rather unlikely since as the consequence the black hole masses of the most luminous fr  ii sources would have to be of @xmath481  m@xmath413 assuming that there is no strong spin powering of the jets .",
    "g.   our results suggest that , at least at high redshifts , fr  ii sources most probably accrete at moderate / high eddington ratios and the black hole spin may play a significant role in the jet production , as both effects seem to be necessary to explain the high estimated kinetic luminosities of fr  ii sources at higher @xmath70 .",
    "h.   we estimated the duty cyles of fr  ii radio galaxies at the break in the kinetic luminosity function , finding them to decrease with redshift from @xmath482 for @xmath483 , to @xmath484 at @xmath485 , to @xmath486 at @xmath487 .",
    "the decrease in duty cycle at higher redshifts may be explained by a combination of the reduction in the lifetime of fr  ii radio galaxies together with evolution in the number density of massive black holes .",
    "the shift in kinetic luminosity break to higher values also indicates an intrinsic change in the population of kinetic powers .",
    "interestingly , at low redshifts the duty cycle of powerful fr  iis exceeds that estimated for @xmath462  m@xmath413 agn based on radiative luminosities .",
    "this difference can be explained if the typical black hole mass of fr  iis shifts to lower masses at low @xmath70 .",
    "alternatively , the low-@xmath70 fr  ii population may become dominated by a kinetically dominated , radiatively inefficient mode of accretion .",

    "<S> radio galaxies and quasars are among the largest and most powerful single objects known and are believed to have had a significant impact on the evolving universe and its large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the population of fanaroff - riley ii ( fr  ii ) objects , that is their kinetic luminosities , lifetimes , and the central densities of their environments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the radio and kinetic luminosity functions of these powerful radio sources are investigated using the complete , flux limited radio catalogues of 3crr and best et al .. we construct multidimensional monte carlo simulations using semi - analytical models of fr  ii source time evolution to create artificial samples of radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> unlike previous studies , we compare radio luminosity functions found with both the observed and simulated data to explore the best - fitting fundamental source parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the new monte carlo method we present here allows us to : ( i ) set better limits on the predicted fundamental parameters of which confidence intervals estimated over broad ranges are presented , and ( ii ) generate the most plausible underlying parent populations of these radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as has not been done before , we allow the source physical properties ( kinetic luminosities , lifetimes and central densities ) to co - evolve with redshift , and we find that all the investigated parameters most likely undergo cosmological evolution . strikingly , we find that the break in the kinetic luminosity function must undergo redshift evolution of at least @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental parameters are strongly degenerate , and independent constraints are necessary to draw more precise conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> we use the estimated kinetic luminosity functions to set constraints on the duty cycles of these powerful radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the duty cycles of powerful fr  iis with those determined from radiative luminosities of agn of comparable black hole mass suggests a transition in behaviour from high to low redshifts , corresponding to either a drop in the typical black hole mass of powerful fr  iis at low redshifts , or a transition to a kinetically - dominated , radiatively - inefficient fr  ii population .    </S>",
