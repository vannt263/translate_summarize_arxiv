    "measurements  @xcite of the neutrino flux produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere  @xcite have led to a major breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental properties of neutrinos .",
    "the early observations of the atmospheric neutrino interaction rates found a muon - to - electron event ratio of about 0.6 times the expected ratio .",
    "this @xmath8 anomaly was interpreted@xcite as evidence for neutrino oscillations with large amplitude and neutrino mass - squared difference @xmath9  ev@xmath6",
    ". continued experimental studies@xcite , especially by the superkamiokande ( superk ) collaboration , have firmly established that the deviation of the @xmath8 ratio from expectation is due to a deficit of muon events .",
    "this muon deficit increases with zenith angle , and hence with path length , and is consistent with expectations for muon - neutrino oscillations to some other neutrino flavor or flavors @xmath10 with maximal or near - maximal amplitude and @xmath11  ev@xmath6 . in principle",
    "@xmath12 could be @xmath13 ( electron - neutrino ) , @xmath14 ( tau - neutrino ) , or @xmath15 ( sterile neutrino )  @xcite .",
    "however , the observed @xmath13 flux is in approximate agreement with the predicted @xmath13 flux for all zenith angles@xcite , which rules out @xmath16 oscillations with large amplitude .",
    "the null results from the chooz and palo verde reactor @xmath17 disappearance experiments@xcite also exclude @xmath18 oscillations at a mass - squared - difference scale @xmath19  ev@xmath6 with amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , large amplitude @xmath21 oscillations at the @xmath22 scale are also excluded by superk .",
    "this is because @xmath21 oscillations are expected to be significantly affected by propagation through matter  @xcite , causing a distortion in the zenith - angle distribution at large angles ( corresponding to long path lengths ) that is not present in the data  @xcite .",
    "the zenith - angle distribution observed by superk excludes @xmath21 oscillations of maximal amplitude at 99% confidence level@xcite .",
    "we conclude that , if the oscillation interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino deficit is correct , the dominant mode must be @xmath23 oscillation , with the possibility of some smaller amplitude muon - neutrino oscillations to sterile and/or electron - neutrinos@xcite .",
    "an exotic alternative interpretation@xcite of the atmospheric neutrino disappearance results is that a neutrino mass - eigenstate , which is a dominant component of the @xmath24 state , decays to a lighter mass - eigenstate and a majoron@xcite .",
    "the first oscillation minimum in @xmath25 must be observed or excluded to differentiate neutrino oscillations from neutrino decays .",
    "unfortunately , the superk neutrino - energy and angular - resolution functions smear out the characteristic @xmath24 event rate dip that would correspond to the first oscillation minimum , which can not therefore be resolved .",
    "progress in establishing neutrino oscillations at the atmospheric scale is expected in the near future at accelerator neutrino sources with detectors at medium to long baselines .",
    "the k2k experiment , from kek to superk@xcite , with a baseline @xmath26  km and average neutrino energy @xmath27  gev , is underway .",
    "their preliminary results are in excellent agreement with the oscillation expectations ( 27 events are observed , whereas 27 events would be expected with oscillations and 40 events for no oscillations@xcite ) .",
    "the minos experiment from fermilab to soudan  @xcite with @xmath28  km and @xmath29  gev , which begins operation in 2003 , is expected to resolve the first oscillation minimum in @xmath30 and to search for @xmath31 oscillations at the @xmath22 scale with an amplitude sensitivity of @xmath4 . beginning in 2005",
    ", similar physics measurements will be made by the icarus@xcite and opera@xcite experiments with neutrinos of average energy @xmath32  gev from cern detected at @xmath33  km in the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "in addition to the atmospheric neutrino deficit , there are other possible indications of neutrino oscillations .",
    "in particular , the long - standing deficit of solar neutrinos  @xcite compared to the standard solar model ( ssm ) predictions  @xcite is widely interpreted as an oscillation depletion of the @xmath13 flux .",
    "note that helioseismology and other solar observations stringently limit uncertainties in the central temperature of the sun and other solar model parameters@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 deficit relative to prediction is about one - half for the water cherenkov  @xcite and gallium experiments  @xcite , with the chlorine experiment  @xcite finding a suppression of about one - third . the latest solar neutrino results from superk show an electron recoil spectrum that is flat in energy , and exhibits no significant day - night or seasonal variation  @xcite .",
    "an industry has developed to extract the allowed ranges of @xmath34 and @xmath13 mixing angles that can account for the solar neutrino data .",
    "the analyses take account of the coherent scattering of @xmath13 on matter  @xcite , both in the sun ( the msw effect  @xcite ) and in the earth  @xcite .",
    "these matter effects can make significant modifications to vacuum oscillation amplitudes . until recently ,",
    "four viable regions of the parameter space were found in global fits to the data :    1 .   lma  large mixing angle with small matter effects ( @xmath35 to @xmath36 ) ; 2 .",
    "sma  small mixing angle with large matter effects ( @xmath37 ) ; 3 .",
    "low  large - angle mixing with quasi - vacuum amplitude ( @xmath38 ) ; 4 .",
    "vo  large - angle vacuum mixing with small matter effects ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the latest global solar neutrino analysis by the superk collaboration@xcite strongly favors solar @xmath13 oscillations to active neutrinos ( @xmath24 and/or @xmath14 ) in the lma region . a very small area in the low region is also allowed at 99%  c.l .",
    ", while the sma and vo regions are rejected at 95%  c.l",
    ". however , other global analyses disagree that the latter regions are excluded  @xcite . moreover",
    ", @xmath40 solar oscillations may also still be viable@xcite . the relative weighting of different experiments ( e.g.  inclusion or exclusion of the cl data ) and whether the @xmath41b flux is held fixed at its ssm value or allowed to float in the global fits presumably account in part for the differences in conclusions .",
    "it is expected that the kamland reactor experiment  @xcite will be able to measure @xmath42 to @xmath43% accuracy and @xmath44 to @xmath45 accuracy  @xcite if the lma solar solution is correct .    finally , the lsnd accelerator experiment@xcite reports evidence for possible @xmath46 and @xmath0 oscillations with very small amplitude and @xmath47 . if , in addition to the lsnd observations , the atmospheric and solar effects are also to be explained by oscillations , then three distinct @xmath48 scales are needed , requiring a sterile neutrino in addition to the three active neutrino flavors@xcite . the miniboone experiment at fermilab@xcite is designed to cover the full region of oscillation parameters indicated by lsnd .",
    "the principal goals of our analyses are to examine the relative merits of different neutrino `` superbeam '' scenarios , where we define a neutrino superbeam as a conventional neutrino beam generated by @xmath49 decays , but using a very intense megawatt(mw)-scale proton source .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the physics reach in medium- and long - baseline experiments with a neutrino superbeam , and how this reach depends upon the beam energy , baseline , and the parameters of the neutrino detector . as representative examples we explicitly consider water cherenkov , liquid argon and iron scintillator detectors .",
    "however , we note that there is room for new detector ideas , detector optimization , and possibly an associated detector r&d program .",
    "therefore , results are presented that apply to any detector for which the effective fiducial mass and background rates can be specified .",
    "finally , we will discuss the role that neutrino superbeams might play  @xcite en route to a neutrino factory  @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed within a three - neutrino oscillation framework with the parameters chosen to describe the atmospheric neutrino deficit and the solar neutrino deficit assuming the lma solution .",
    "however , our considerations for long - baseline experiments are relevant even if there are additional short - baseline oscillation effects associated with a fourth neutrino  @xcite .",
    "the central objective of long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is to determine the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix and the magnitudes and signs of the neutrino mass - squared differences ; the signs fix the hierarchy of the neutrino mass eigenstates  @xcite . for three neutrinos @xmath50 the mixing matrix",
    "relevant to oscillation phenomena can be specified by three angles @xmath51 and a phase @xmath52 associated with @xmath1-violation [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mns ] ) below ] .",
    "there are only two independent mass - squared differences ( e.g.  @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) for three neutrinos .",
    "the muon - disappearance measurements at superk constrain @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the other parameter that enters at the leading @xmath53 oscillation scale is @xmath57 , and its measurement requires the observation of neutrino appearance in @xmath58 , @xmath0 , or @xmath59 oscillations .    in long - baseline experiments , if @xmath57 is nonzero , matter effects  @xcite modify the probability for oscillations involving a @xmath13 or @xmath17 in a way that can be used to determine the sign of @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "matter effects give apparent @xmath1-violation , but this may be disentangled from intrinsic @xmath1-violation effects   at optimally chosen baselines .",
    "matter can also modify the effects of intrinsic @xmath1 or @xmath61 violation  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic @xmath1 violation may also be studied at short baselines where matter effects are relatively small  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-violating effects enter only for values of @xmath62 where oscillations associated with the subleading @xmath54 become significant  @xcite .",
    "the most challenging goal of accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments is to detect , or place stringent limits on , @xmath1 violation in the lepton sector .",
    "we will address the extent to which this may be possible with conventional superbeams .",
    "the flavor eigenstates @xmath63 are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath64 in vacuum by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a unitary @xmath67 mixing matrix .",
    "the propagation of neutrinos through matter is described by the evolution equation  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the amplitude for coherent forward charged - current @xmath13 scattering on electrons , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the electron fraction and @xmath73 is the matter density . in the earth s crust the average density is typically 34  gm / cm@xmath7 and @xmath75 .",
    "the propagation equations can be re - expressed in terms of mass - squared differences : @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "we assume @xmath78 , and that the sign of @xmath79 can be either positive or negative , corresponding to the case where the most widely separated mass eignstate is either above or below , respectively , the other two mass eigenstates .",
    "thus the sign of @xmath79 determines the ordering of the neutrino masses .",
    "the evolution equations can be solved numerically taking into account the dependence of the density on depth using the density profile from the preliminary reference earth model@xcite .",
    "we integrate the equations numerically along the neutrino path using a runge - kutta method . the step size at each point along the path",
    "is taken to be 1% of the shortest oscillation wavelength given by the two scales @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "( [ eq : cpv ] ) is of order unity , and the relative size of the @xmath119 term is @xmath123 as an example , with @xmath124  ev@xmath6 and @xmath125  km / gev , @xmath126 ; then with @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( its maximum allowed value ) , the @xmath119 term is about 25% of the @xmath120 term .",
    "smaller values of @xmath129 or @xmath130 decrease the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpv2 ] ) ; smaller values of @xmath57 increase it .",
    "while smaller values of @xmath57 give a larger relative @xmath119 term , they will also reduce the overall @xmath131 event rate since the @xmath120 term is proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath119 effect may be hard to measure if the event rate is low ( due to insufficient flux or a small detector ) . because the number of @xmath120 events is proportional to @xmath132 ,",
    "the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath120 event rate is proportional to @xmath57 for small @xmath57 and gaussian statistics .",
    "since the number of @xmath119 events is also proportional to @xmath57 , the size of the @xmath119 signal relative to the statistical uncertainties does not decrease as @xmath57 becomes smaller .",

    "so that the dominant @xmath119 effect is from matter and the sign of @xmath158 is clearly determinable ; then the true @xmath119 effect can be extracted by considering deviations from the @xmath1-conserving predictions  @xcite . with large @xmath86 , the neutrino energies must be high enough that @xmath113 ( e.g. , @xmath159  km requires @xmath160  gev ) .",

    "the matter effect is similar in size or smaller than the true @xmath119 effect , and it may not be possible to distinguish between large intrinsic @xmath119 with very small @xmath57 from no intrinsic @xmath119 with a moderate - sized @xmath57 . even in experiments at short distances ( where the matter effect is small )",
    "the number of appearance events may be too small relative to the background to have a statistically significant difference between the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities .",

    "the dominant decays that contribute to the @xmath13 component are @xmath166 and @xmath167",
    ". if the pion beam has not been charge - sign selected there will also be a contribution from @xmath168 decays .",
    "the @xmath169  contamination \" can be minimized using beam optics that disfavor decays occurring close to the target [ note : @xmath170 , and choosing a short decay channel to reduce the contribution from muon decays .",
    "these strategies enhance the flavor purity of the beam , but reduce the beam flux .",
    "depending on the beamline design , the resulting @xmath169 contamination is typically at the few parts in 100 to a few parts in 1000 level .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath13 component in the beam produces a background that must be subtracted in a @xmath16 oscillation search .",
    "ultimately , the systematic uncertainty associated with the background subtraction will degrade the sensitivity of the oscillation measurement .    to maximize the neutrino flux in the forward direction it is desirable that the pion beam divergence is small within the decay channel .",
    "the required radial focusing can be provided by a quadrupole channel and/or magnetic horns .",
    "the beamline optics ( dipoles , horns , and quadrupoles ) determine the peak pion energy and energy spread within the decay channel , and hence determine the neutrino spectrum .",
    "if the optics are designed to accept a large pion momentum spread the resulting wide band beam ( wbb ) will contain a large neutrino flux with a broad energy spectrum .",
    "if the optics are designed to accept a smaller pion momentum spread , the resulting narrow band beam ( nbb ) will have a narrower energy spread , but a smaller flux .",
    "we are primarily interested in searching for , and measuring , @xmath16 and @xmath171 oscillations .",
    "the experimental signature for these oscillation modes is the appearance of an energetic electron or positron in a charged - current ( cc ) event .",
    "the electron must be separated from the hadronic remnants produced by the fragmenting nucleon .",
    "backgrounds can arise from ( i ) energetic neutral pions that are produced in neutral - current ( nc ) interactions , and subsequently fake a prompt - electron signature , ( ii ) energetic neutral pions that are produced in cc interactions in which the muon is undetected , and the @xmath172 fakes an electron , ( iii ) charm production and semileptonic decay , ( iv ) @xmath23 oscillations followed by decay of the tau - lepton to an electron . backgrounds ( iii ) and ( iv ) can be suppressed using a low - energy neutrino beam .",
    "background ( i ) is potentially the most dangerous since leading @xmath172 production in nc events is not uncommon .",
    "indeed , in a recent study  @xcite using a low energy @xmath24 beam it has been shown that in a water cherenkov detector ( e.g. superk ) it is difficult to reduce this background to a level below @xmath173(3% ) of the cc rate .",
    "a liquid argon detector is believed to provide much better @xmath172-electron discrimination , and will perhaps enable the @xmath172 background to be reduced to @xmath173(0.1% ) of the cc rate  @xcite . based on these considerations",
    "there are two different detector strategies .",
    "we can choose a water cherenkov detector , enabling us to maximize the detector mass , and hence the event statistics , but obliging us to tolerate a significant background from @xmath172 production in nc events .",
    "alternatively , we can choose a detector technology that highly suppresses the @xmath172 background , but this will oblige us to use a smaller fiducial mass , and hence lower event statistics .    for a given choice of beamline design , baseline , and detector parameters ,",
    "the experimental @xmath16 and @xmath171 sensitivities can be calculated .",
    "it is useful to define some representative scenarios , characterized by ( a ) the parameters of the primary proton beam incident on the pion production target , ( b ) the data sample size @xmath174 ( kt - years ) , defined as the product of the detector fiducial mass , the efficiency of the signal selection requirements , and the number of years of data taking , ( c ) the background fraction @xmath136 defined as the background rate divided by the cc rate for events that survive the signal selection requirements , and ( d ) the fractional systematic uncertainty @xmath175 on the predicted @xmath136 .",

    "higher beam intensities are precluded by space - charge limitations in the mi  @xcite . for both the sjhf and snumi cases",
    "we will assume a run plan in which there is 3  years of data taking with a neutrino beam followed by 6  years of data taking with an antineutrino beam .",

    "the predictions for each of these cases are shown as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath52 , and the sign of @xmath79 , with @xmath261  ev@xmath6 and @xmath262 .",
    "note that at @xmath212  km the magnitude of the modifications of the appearance rates due to matter effects are comparable to the magnitudes of the modifications due to maximal intrinsic @xmath1 violation .",

    "hence , in the scenario we are considering , fig .",
    "[ fig : numicpv1 ] shows that superbeam measurements with the le beam at 730  km can help to constrain the parameter space , but generally can not provide unambiguous evidence for intrinsic @xmath1 violation , and can not unambiguously determine the sign of @xmath79 .",
    "the only exception to this is if @xmath265 and @xmath266 ( or @xmath208 and @xmath248 ) , in which case @xmath1 violation could be established and the sign of @xmath79 determined for @xmath267 .",
    "the @xmath1 and matter effects are better separated at @xmath268  km , for which an unambiguous determination of the sign of @xmath79 seems possible provided @xmath269 , although @xmath1 violation can not be established for @xmath270  ev@xmath6 . at smaller values of @xmath271 modifications to the appearance rates can not distinguish between matter and @xmath1 effects .",

    "also note that the sign of @xmath79 is most easily determined when the @xmath119 and matter effects interfere constructively to give a greater disparity of @xmath263 and @xmath264 , and more difficult when the @xmath119 and matter effects interfere destructively [ i.e. , @xmath263 and @xmath264 are more equal ] . going to even longer baselines , predictions in the [ @xmath244 plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numicpv2 ] for scenario @xmath80 ( left - hand plots ) and scenario @xmath186 ( right - hand plots ) with @xmath273  km .",
    "the predictions are shown for the le beam ( top plots ) , me beam ( middle plots ) , and he beam ( bottom plots ) .",
    "in general , the sign of @xmath79 can be determined provided @xmath274 , but in none of the explored long - baseline scenarios can @xmath1-violation be unambiguously established for @xmath275  ev@xmath6 .",
    "we can ask , how do the @xmath119 and @xmath79-sign capabilities of superbeams compare with those of a neutrino factory ?",
    "the relevant experimental signature at neutrino factory is the appearance of a wrong - sign muon indicating @xmath276 ( or @xmath18 ) transitions .",
    "this is a much cleaner signature than electron appearance with a superbeam .",
    "hence , background systematics are under better control at a neutrino factory , and the expected error ellipses in the [ n(@xmath277 ) , n(@xmath278)]-plane are therefore much smaller .    in our analysis",
    "we assume a 20  gev neutrino factory with @xmath279 useful @xmath280 decays ( which might be achieved in three years running at at high - performance neutrino factory ) and @xmath281 useful @xmath282 decays , a 50  kt iron  scintillator detector  @xcite at distances @xmath268  km , 2900  km , and 4000  km from the source . for comparison , the total neutrino flux for three years running at a distance of 1  km from the source is @xmath283 for the neutrino factory scenario , while it is @xmath284 for sjhf and @xmath285 for the snumi he beam .",
    "we choose an iron  scintillator detector for the neutrino factory analysis since it is particularly well  suited for the detection of muons and can be made larger than , e.g. , a liquid argon detector , at a similar or lower cost .",
    "we also take @xmath286 , @xmath181 , and a normalization uncertainty of 2% .",
    "this background level can be achieved with a 4  gev cut on the detected muon , which gives a detection efficiency of about 73% , implying an effective data sample of @xmath287  kt  yr for three years running .",
    "the corresponding neutrino factory predictions in the [ n(@xmath278 ) , n(@xmath277)]-plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nufactcpv ] .",
    "the 1800  km baseline is too short , since matter and @xmath1 effects are indistinguishable in most cases . at 2900  km",
    "the predictions allow an unambiguous determination of the sign of @xmath288 for much of the parameter space , and the possibility of establishing the existence of @xmath119 . at 4000  km",
    "the statistical uncertainties are larger , and impair the sensitivity to observe @xmath119 . however , matter effects are also larger , and an unambiguous determination of the sign of @xmath79 is possible down to @xmath2 of a few @xmath289 . for very long baselines ( e.g. @xmath215  km , fig .",
    "[ fig : nufactcpv2 ] ) there is negligible sensitivity to @xmath119 or to @xmath129 , matter effects are large , and the @xmath2 reach for determining the sign of @xmath79 approaches @xmath290 .",
    "we have explored the oscillation - physics capabilities of 1  gev and multi - gev neutrino beams produced at mw - scale proton accelerator facilities ( neutrino superbeams ) . specifically , the limiting value of @xmath2 that would permit the first observation of @xmath16 and/or @xmath171 oscillations at 3 standard deviations is considered , along with the ability of these intense conventional neutrino beams to determine the pattern of neutrino masses ( sign of @xmath79 ) and discover @xmath1-violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the figures in this paper provide a toolkit for accessing the physics capabilities as a function of the detector specifications , characterized by the dataset size @xmath174  ( kt - years ) and the uncertainty on the background subtraction ( given by @xmath136 and @xmath175 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : s ] summarizes the physics capabilities of some beam - detector combinations .",
    "also shown in the table are similar results for an entry - level and high - performance neutrino factory with @xmath291  gev .",
    "determining the optimum detector technology and characteristics is beyond the scope of this paper , and may require a detector r&d program .",
    "however , for some ambitious but plausible detector scenarios we find :    \\(i ) with a sufficiently ambitious detector , if @xmath292 few @xmath293 and @xmath207 , then @xmath16 and @xmath294 signals should be observable at a superbeam .",
    "the reach is slightly worse if @xmath208 . the best reach",
    "is obtained with a long - baseline multi - gev superbeam ; for example , with the snumi me or he beams and a baseline @xmath295  km .",
    "this would permit the tightening of constraints on the oscillation parameter space .",
    "it is important to account for decay channel length restrictions when assessing the capabilities of very - long - baseline experiments .",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath1 is maximally violated in the lepton sector , there is a small region of allowed parameter space in which an experiment at a jhf or sjhf beam ( @xmath162  gev ) might be able to establish @xmath1-violation at 3 standard deviations . except for certain small regions in parameter space",
    "where matter and @xmath119 effects constructively interfere , a long - baseline experiment with conventional superbeams would be unable to unambiguously establish @xmath1 violation because matter effects can confuse the interpretation of the measurements .",
    "\\(iii ) with a sufficiently ambitious detector , if @xmath296 there is a significant region of parameter space over which a long baseline experiment with a multi - gev neutrino superbeam could unambiguously establish the sign of @xmath79 .",
    "\\(iv ) lower - energy superbeams do best at shorter distances , with a fair reach for @xmath131 appearance and some @xmath119 capability , but little or no sensitivity to the sign of @xmath79 ; higher - energy superbeams do best at longer distances , with good reach for @xmath131 appearance and sign(@xmath79 ) determination , but little or no sensitivity to @xmath119 .",
    "\\(v ) a neutrino factory can deliver between one and two orders of magnitude better reach in @xmath132 for @xmath206 appearance , the sign of @xmath79 , and @xmath1 violation ; for @xmath297  km there is excellent sensitivity to all three observables .",
