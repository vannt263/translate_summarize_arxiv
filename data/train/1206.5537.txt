    ", the asymmetry is generated in decays of rh neutrinos .",
    "the deviation from thermal equilibrium in this case is due to the expansion of the universe , and leptogenesis happens due to out - of - equilibrium decays at the time when the interaction rates of the rh neutrinos become maxwell suppressed .",
    "these scenarios are known as thermal leptogenesis .",
    "another possibility is that the asymmetry is generated during the thermal production of right handed neutrinos by @xmath0-violating oscillations amongst them  @xcite . referring to its discoverers ,",
    "this is sometimes referred to as akhmedov - rubakov - smirnov ( ars ) scenario .",
    "both scenarios are based on the same lagrangian terms @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the higgs doublet , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the antisymmetric rank two @xmath5 tensor ) .",
    "the majorana spinors @xmath6 represent rh neutrinos , and @xmath7 are the active leptons .",
    "we choose a flavour basis where the majorana mass @xmath8 and charged lepton yukawa matrices are diagonal .",
    "besides the yukawa couplings @xmath9 , interactions with active right - handed leptons are of importance , because these lead to the decoherence of off - diagonal correlations of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . at the temperatures",
    "that the present work is concerned with , the decoherence can be assumed as complete  @xcite . for a discussion of the case of incomplete flavour decoherence , _ cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "though flavour effects may be important  @xcite , the matter - antimatter asymmetry in thermal leptogenesis is usually due to the violation of total lepton number by the majorana masses @xmath12 of the right handed neutrinos .",
    "since lepton - number violation is strongly suppressed at low temperatures @xmath13 , the lepton asymmetry can be preserved from washout after the rh neutrino freeze - out though all other fields are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "an important phenomenological consequence for models of this type is that the mass of the lightest sterile neutrino should be larger than @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "due account of the effects from active lepton flavours  @xcite leads to some changes in the details of the mass bound , including the possibility that the sterile neutrino whose decay leaves behind the lepton asymmetry is not necessarily the lightest  @xcite .",
    "they , however , have no qualitative impact on the mass bound , which remains far above the electroweak scale .",
    "the large required majorana masses , which make most model parameters inaccessible to laboratory experiments , are the main disadvantage of thermal leptogenesis models .",
    "a popular way to evade the lower mass bound on @xmath12 of @xmath14  @xcite within models specified by the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) is to introduce a symmetry or a tuning that implies a mass degeneracy @xmath15 this option is usually referred to as resonant leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the numerator above and correspondingly in the source for the lepton asymmetry , eq .",
    "( [ s : unflavoured ] ) below , occurs because the creation of a lepton asymmetry demands an insertion of a lepton - number violating ( or , equivalently , helicity reversing ) majorana mass into the loop diagram that gives the main contribution to the decay asymmetry of the sterile neutrinos .    in ars models of leptogenesis , on the other hand",
    ", it is essential that not all of the sterile rh neutrinos reach thermal equilibrium before the sphaleron freeze - out at @xmath16 gev .",
    "therefore , their yukawa couplings must not be too large .",
    "this constrains the masses @xmath12 from above , as these are related to the yukawa couplings by the seesaw relation @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and @xmath19 the active neutrino mass scale . as a result ,",
    "the total lepton number violation in these models is tiny at @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "a non - zero baryon number can be generated even for vanishing total lepton number due to flavour effects and because sphalerons only couple to active neutrinos , which can carry a net asymmetry that is compensated for in the sterile sector .",
    "the smaller masses make it possible to search for the right handed neutrinos in collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , the small production rates for sterile neutrinos , essential to avoid their equilibration and washout of the asymmetries long before sphaleron freeze - out , also enter the source term for the asymmetries .",
    "most studies of ars - type models to date  @xcite require a mass degeneracy of the type  ( [ enhancement ] ) to compensate for the resulting suppression . if not justified by a symmetry , this can be considered as tuning .    in this work",
    "we show that , due to thermal effects , no mass degeneracy needs to be required to produce the observed bau .",
    "while the total lepton number violation is always proportional to @xmath12 , and hence suppressed unless a degeneracy  ( [ enhancement ] ) is imposed , there is no such suppression for the generation of asymmetries in individual flavours .",
    "this is a pure medium effect ; in vacuum , lorentz invariance and dimensional arguments imply that the purely flavoured asymmetry is proportional to the mass - square of the decaying sterile neutrino , which has been verified by explicit calculations  @xcite . at temperatures",
    "@xmath22 different medium effects are very important ) asymmetry , which are suppressed or forbidden in the vacuum , can become important at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "] , and one can readily estimate the enhancement factor for the flavoured asymmetries to be @xmath23 we show explicitly that due to this effect , the flavoured asymmetries in ars scenarios are largely enhanced compared to the total lepton asymmetry . this may be interpreted a way to circumvent the mass bounds  @xcite , that apply to the non - resonant creation of a lepton - number violating asymmetry .",
    "we derive simple analytic expressions for the flavoured asymmetries , that allow us to find parameters for which the observed bau arises from sterile neutrinos with gev masses and without the mass degeneracy  ( [ enhancement ] ) .",
    "the flavoured asymmetries are effectively converted into a baryon asymmetry due to sphaleron conversion , because for our parametric examples , the active lepton flavour @xmath24 is only weakly washed out before sphaleron freeze - out , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 suffer a strong washout .",
    "we expect that similar effects may also reduce the lower mass bound or required degree of mass degeneracy for flavoured scenarios in which the asymmetry is generated from heavy neutrino decays .    the relevant temperature in the term  ( [ enhancement : flavoured ] )",
    "is determined by the time that is required to build up the off - diagonal correlations between the sterile neutrinos  @xcite ( or , in other words , the oscillation time of the sterile neutrinos ) . for @xmath27-scale neutrinos with mass - splittings of a similar size",
    ", it turns out that @xmath28 .",
    "further , we can estimate that the shorter hubble time @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the hubble rate and @xmath31 is the planck mass ) suppresses the production of the flavoured asymmetries at high temperatures compared to the lepton - number violating asymmetry , that is mostly produced close to sphaleron freeze - out at @xmath32 , by a factor of @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "the production rate of sterile neutrinos with @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35 , what leads to a relative enhancement @xmath36 . combining these enhancements and suppressions with the factor  ( [ enhancement : flavoured ] )",

    "lepton number conservation implies @xmath175 . with @xmath49 ,",
    "the latter two equations imply that @xmath176 is the part of the asymmetry , that is cancelled before sphaleron freeze - out .",
    "furthermore , from the values of @xmath177 , we estimate that about half of the asymmetry in this flavour is transferred to the sterile sector , where it annihilates with the asymmetries in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the baryon asymmetry can be estimated as @xmath178 ( @xmath179 being the sphaleron - conversion factor ) , and the parametric configurations in table  [ table : scenarios ] may therefore account for the observed baryon asymmetry and for the observed neutrino oscillations .",
    "we emphasise that the scenarios  i and  ii correspond to particular points in parameter space , and that the present analysis does not quantify how generically successful baryogenesis via flavoured leptogenesis for @xmath27-scale sterile neutrinos can occur .",
    "nonetheless , the present examples demonstrate that the order @xmath180 mass degeneracy , that is necessary for generating a sufficient amount of lepton - number violating asymmetries , can be largely relaxed for the flavoured scenarios .",
    "we have demonstrated that for @xmath27-scale sterile neutrinos without a mass degeneracy , flavoured leptogenesis can be a viable mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the simple analytic expression  ( [ flavoured : asymmetries ] ) has been used to identify viable points in parameter space with no mass - degeneracy , which is in contrast to scenarios that have been discussed earlier and that rely on sterile neutrinos close to the electroweak scale or below  @xcite . the key ingredient to the variant of the ars mechanism that is studied here is the fact that the flavoured asymmetry is for our parameters most effectively generated at @xmath181 , where thermal effects can considerably enhance it . for higher temperatures ,",
    "the mass difference is small compared to the hubble rate and there is no time for the neutrinos to oscillate ( or , in other words , for off - diagonal correlations to build up ) , what leads to a suppression .",
    "compared to lower temperatures , the production at @xmath182 is larger due to the resonant enhancement factor  ( [ enhancement : flavoured ] ) and the neutrino production rate  ( [ gamma : n ] ) . on the other hand , an effective suppression results from the smaller time scale associated with @xmath123 , @xmath183 .",
    "the temperature @xmath123 has been identified earlier as a favourable instant for the creation of lepton asymmetries in ref  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ source : flavoured:2 ] ) , we have generalised the @xmath0-violating source term of refs .",
    "@xcite , such that it includes the possibility of non - degenerate active lepton - flavours . comparing the lepton - number violating with the purely flavoured contribution , we observe that the latter does not exhibit the suppression factor @xmath184 that is associated with the lepton - number violating helicity flip .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( [ sigma : t0 ] ) and  ( [ sigma : tlarge ] ) are a consistency check and further illustrate the importance of finite - temperature effects .",
    "in particular , they elucidate how the ars scenario circumvents the mass bounds  @xcite that apply to the total lepton - number violation or when finite temperature effects are negligible .",
    "a similar type of enhancement of the flavoured asymmetries , that relies on the ratio between the square of the temperature and the difference of the squares of the masses of higgs bosons has been proposed in ref  @xcite .",
    "we have used here nonequilibrium quantum field theory methods , in particular the ctp formalism , in order to calculate the asymmetries . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the canonical time - evolution of a density matrix is employed for this purpose .",
    "our result for the flavoured asymmetry differs from ref .",
    "@xcite , but it parametrically agrees with ref .",
    "moreover , our flavoured asymmetries appear as a consistent generalisation of the results from refs .",
    "@xcite , where the decay asymmetries are calculated from @xmath38-matrix elements .",
    "the present work therefore exhibits the close relation of the ars mechanism to the more conventional scenarios of flavoured thermal leptogenesis .",
    "phenomenologically , we have demonstrated the viability of the mechanism with non - degenerate masses by calculating the lepton asymmetry for the parameters given in table  [ table : scenarios ] . that we do not need to require a mass degeneracy here is due to the fact that we find parameters , for which it is possible",
    "that the asymmetry in the flavour @xmath24 is only weakly washed out , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 already equilibrate with the sterile neutrinos above @xmath111 .",
    "more systematic studies of the parameter space should however be of interest . the simple analytic formula  ( [ flavoured : asymmetries ] ) for the asymmetry may be of particular use for such analyses . for the scenarios in table  [ table : scenarios ] , we find that the mass degeneracy of the sterile neutrinos can be completely alleviated or at least be largely relaxed compared to what is stated _",
    "e.g. _ in refs .",
    "however , it should be noticed that the parameters @xmath158 have no direct physical interpretation and that the moderately large values we consider correspond to cancellations of different contributions to the masses of active leptons .",
    "in other words , the yukawa couplings are somewhat larger than for most of the points in parameter space for the seesaw mechanism . in the future",
    ", it will therefore be interesting to pursue possibilities that either do not require such cancellations or explain these :    * the estimate of @xmath185 , that is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , relies on the simple extrapolation of the standard model with additional sterile neutrinos to high temperatures , such that the main production channels for the sterile neutrinos are via scatterings of @xmath5 and @xmath186 gauge bosons . in many extensions of the standard model , interactions with an extended higgs sector , with the dark matter sector or larger couplings",
    "are encountered at higher energies .",
    "this would lead to an enhancement of @xmath185 and would be of importance for the asymmetry , that , through the source term  ( [ source : flavoured:2 ] ) , depends quadratically on @xmath185 . * larger yukawa couplings for fixed masses of the active neutrinos can be achieved in models with several higgs doublets . in order to avoid flavour problems , an additional leptoholic higgs , that exclusively couples to leptons , may be suitable . *",
    "models with an approximate lepton - number conservation can typically accommodate for largely enhanced yukawa couplings  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to study the implications of the thermal effects in the source term  ( [ source : flavoured:2 ] ) for these scenarios .",
    "* sterile neutrinos with masses of a few gev can in principle be found in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this possibility certainly exists when the bau is generated from mass - degenerate sterile neutrinos .",
    "for the exemplary parts of the parameter space we study , the active - sterile mixing is too small to search for them in existing or near - future experimental facilities .",
    "larger mixings are essentially forbidden because at least one active flavours must be out of chemical equilibrium at @xmath187 to avoid a complete washout of the flavour asymmetries .",
    "this is despite the fact that we consider a situation in which the mixings of two active flavours are large compared to the third one .",
    "it remains to be clarified in systematic scans of the higher - dimensional parameter - space for models with several right handed neutrinos whether there are regions in which this suppression is sufficiently strong such that sterile neutrinos without mass degeneracy that can explain the bau may at the same time be directly experimentally accessible .",
    "these are intriguing prospects , whether there is a higgs sector as in standard model or in an extended form .",
    "even with non - degenerate masses at the @xmath27-scale , sterile neutrinos thus provide a plausible possible explanation for the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we would like to thank alejandro ibarra for useful remarks on large imaginary parts of @xmath158 .",
