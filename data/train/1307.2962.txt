    "even higher dispersions in excess of @xmath108 are seen along the southern edge of ngc  55 , possibly resulting from different layers of gas along the line of sight due to the warping of the outer  disc .",

    "the  disc of ngc  55 appears distorted , suggesting that the galaxy has recently been subjected to internal or external processes ( such as tidal interaction , accretion , ram pressure , or star formation ) that have led to the observed asymmetries and distortions . in section  [ sect_discussion ]",
    "we will assess in more detail the different potential processes that could have shaped the  disc .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     this asymmetry is remarkably similar to the one seen in neighbouring ngc  300 , which we attributed to ram - pressure interaction with the intergalactic medium in the sculptor group ( see paper  1 ) .",
    "a basic calculation revealed that under reasonable assumptions on the density of the igm , @xmath111 to @xmath112 , and the relative velocity of ngc  300 , @xmath113 , ram - pressure forces have the potential to distort the  gas near the outer edge of the disc of ngc  300 .",
    "these results would apply to ngc  55 as well under the assumption that both galaxies have a comparable mass and experience similar igm densities , as expected from their proximity and common group membership .",
    "hence , ngc  55 would be affected by ram pressure in the same way as ngc  300 , resulting in similar distortions of the outer  disc of ngc  55 , in agreement with our observational results .",
    "if the global asymmetries in the outer  discs of ngc  55 and  300 were indeed caused by ram - pressure interaction , we could use the orientation of their ` tails ' to deduce the approximate projected direction of motion of the two galaxies relative to the igm of the sculptor group . in this case",
    ", ngc  300 would be moving in a south - easterly direction ( with respect to the igm , not the celestial coordinate system ) , while ngc  55 would be moving towards the south - west at a slightly smaller angle with respect to the right ascension axis ( fig .",

    "this geometry suggests that ngc  55 and  300 were much closer to one another in the past and are currently moving away from each other , raising the question of whether there could have been a close encounter between the two galaxies in the past that could have led to the observed distortions and asymmetries in the outer gas discs of both galaxies .",
    "the possibility of a recent encounter with either ngc  300 or another sculptor group member was already mentioned by @xcite and @xcite based on the observed asymmetries in both the velocity field and the distribution of the  gas .",
    "recent distance estimates place both ngc  55 and ngc  300 at approximately the same distance of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the distance , @xmath114 , between the two galaxies can directly be inferred from their angular separation on the sky of @xmath115 , hence @xmath116 , which is merely eight times the diameter of the  disc of ngc  300 of about @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , ngc  55 and  300 form a relatively close pair ( fig .  [ fig_sculptor ] ) , their separation being only about a third of the distance between the andromeda galaxy and the milky way ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    at the same time",
    ", both galaxies also have approximately the same radial velocity of @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the barycentric reference frame for ngc  55 and 300 , respectively . assuming a significant relative velocity of ngc  55 with respect to ngc  300 , this implies that the vector of the relative velocity between the two galaxies must lie almost exactly in the plane of the sky .",
    "an object travelling at a constant velocity of @xmath120 would be able to traverse the current distance between ngc  55 and ngc  300 in approximately @xmath121 .",
    "this result , although based on a greatly simplified estimate , illustrates that ngc  55 and 300 could well have been much closer to each other at some point during the past one or two billion years , and it would seem likely that such an encounter could have resulted in the strong distortions and warping observed in the  discs of both galaxies today .    if we assume a rotation velocity of @xmath122 at the outermost point of the rotation curve of @xmath123 , the resulting orbital period for gas particles near the edge of the  disc is about @xmath124 . hence ,",
    "the gas in outer disc of ngc  55 has only completed about one orbit since the possible encounter with ngc  300 .",
    "this may not be enough for the outer disc of ngc  55 to dynamically settle from potential disturbances induced by the gravitational pull of ngc  300  and vice versa  supporting the concept that the substantial warping observed in the discs of the two galaxies today could have originated from a previous close encounter of ngc  55 and  300 between @xmath125 and @xmath126 ago .",
    "an alternative mechanism to explain the warping seen in ngc  55 could be a recent interaction with a smaller satellite galaxy .",

    "another option would be that the satellite responsible for the distortions has already been accreted on to the disc of ngc  55 , thereby generating the numerous extra - planar gas features visible in fig .",
    "[ fig_disc ] .",
    "the assumption of a recent interaction with a satellite galaxy is supported by deep optical photometry of a small section covering the northern part of the stellar disc of ngc  55 by @xcite . by selecting populations of red and blue rgb stars through simple colour and metallicity cuts they reveal the presence of a thick disc in ngc  55 with a scale height of @xmath130 .",

    "@xcite interpret this asymmetry as the possible signature of an accretion event affecting the disturbed eastern part of the disc .",

    "[ fig_disc ] ) .",
    "distortions in the stellar disc can only occur as the result of gravitational forces , and it seems likely that the interaction or merging event that was capable of creating the noticeable asymmetry of the thick disc is also responsible for some of the distortions of the  disc in the eastern half of ngc  55 , potentially forming some of the spurs and clumps observed in the outer regions of the disc .    , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",

    "the origin of some of the brighter and more extended clouds seen in the vicinity of ngc  55 and  300 @xcite has been controversial , resulting in vigorous discussions in the literature .",
    "@xcite speculated that the clouds , and other high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) found in the northern sky by other observers , were forming an intergalactic population , with the clouds near ngc  55 and  300 being located within the sculptor group .",
    "that opinion was refuted by @xcite based on the clouds positions and velocities .",
    "instead , @xcite argued that the clouds were more likely to be part of the magellanic stream which runs across the same region on the sky .",
    "their notion was supported by @xcite who mapped the entire magellanic stream in with the 64-m parkes telescope and found no convincing evidence for an association of the clouds with the sculptor group .    as discussed in detail in section  [ sect_hvcs ]",
    ", there is evidence for the brightest and most extended clouds detected in our data , clouds  6 and  7 , to be foreground objects and part of the presumed population of magellanic stream clouds studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the remaining clouds , however , are conspicuously concentrated near ngc  55 , with small angular separations from the disc and radial velocities similar to those of ngc  55 , leading us to conclude that they are distinct from the population described by @xcite and @xcite and instead form a circum - galactic population surrounding ngc  55 .",
    "populations of circum - galactic gas clouds or hvcs are not uncommon and have been discovered around several other external galaxies , most notably the andromeda galaxy @xcite , m33 @xcite , the m81  group @xcite , and m83 @xcite .",
    "the population of hvcs around m31 , discovered by @xcite and studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite , is located within about @xmath133 of m31 .",

    "@xcite conclude that the clouds found in the m81  group are likely the result of tidal interaction between the galaxies in the group , while @xcite assume a combination of tidal stripping and galactic fountain @xcite for the hvcs near m83 .",
    "unfortunately , the information gathered from emission - line observations alone is seldom sufficient to constrain the origin of gas clouds in the vicinity of galaxies , and our observations are no exception in this regard . in the case of ngc  55 the proximity ( in projection ) of the clouds to the disc of the galaxy speaks against their being primordial , gaseous satellites . at such close distances",
    "the clouds would be subject to strong ram - pressure forces exerted by the halo and disc gas of ngc  55 and would have rather short lifetimes inconsistent with the concept of a stable orbit .",
    "a more promising scenario could be tidal stripping .",
    "as discussed earlier , tidal interaction and accretion of satellites could be responsible for some of the distortions of the  disc of ngc  55 , and there is evidence that cloud number  5 is related to the southern spur of the disc .",
    "it seems likely that tidal interaction and accretion events capable of producing the strong distortions observed in the  disc of the galaxy could also have created some of the isolated gas clouds .",
    "this would naturally explain the small projected distances of most clouds from the disc .",
    "it is also remarkable that almost all of the clouds have velocities close to the systemic velocity of ngc  55 .",
    "six of the eight clouds are within @xmath134 of the systemic velocity , and four of those are even within @xmath135 .",
    "however , this observation can not be considered as a strong argument for or against either tidal stripping or dark - matter satellites .",
    "the concentration of clouds near the disc of ngc  55 with velocities close to the galaxy s systemic velocity would also be consistent with the concept of gas being ejected from ( or falling towards ) the disc of ngc  55 by some internal mechanism .",
    "if we assume that the gas is being ejected approximately perpendicular to the disc plane , then its radial velocity , as seen by a terrestrial observer , could well be close to systemic due to the disc s high inclination of about @xmath136 to @xmath109  degrees .",
    "one such mechanism , which has been discussed extensively in the literature , is the so - called ` galactic fountain ' @xcite , by which ionised gas ejected from the disc by supernovae would be injected into the galactic corona , where it would cool down , condense high above the disc , and fall back towards the disc on a ballistic trajectory .",
    "the galactic fountain mechanism has been proposed to explain the existence of some of the high- and intermediate - velocity clouds of the milky way @xcite , although others have questioned this hypothesis based on theoretical considerations @xcite and metallicity measurements of hvcs ( @xcite ; also see @xcite ) .",

    "nevertheless , our flux measurement should be considered a lower limit due to optical depth effects and missing short spacings .",

    "3 .   the  disc of ngc  55 shows a strong global asymmetry in the column density distribution , with a conspicuous ` tail ' in the east , but a sharp and abrupt ` edge ' in the west .",
