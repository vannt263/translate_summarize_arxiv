    "the first three types of codes are called trivial , the fourth has the parameters of hamming codes , and the last one is the binary golay code . a perfect code with minimum distance @xmath16 is also called a @xmath17-perfect code .    a binary code with length @xmath8 , minimum distance @xmath16 , and @xmath24 codewords is called a @xmath25 code . in this notation",
    "a binary @xmath26-perfect code is a @xmath27 code .",
    "two related families are the extended and shortened @xmath26-perfect codes , which have parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "existence of binary @xmath26-perfect codes follows from the existence of hamming codes , which are the unique _ linear _ @xmath26-perfect codes . still constructing all @xmath26-perfect codes",
    "is a longstanding open problem .",
    "it makes sense to approach this issue by considering the number of _ inequivalent _ codes ( or more formally the number of equivalence classes ) .",
    "two codes are said to be equivalent if one is obtained from the other by permuting coordinates and adding a constant vector ; a formal definition appears in section  [ sec : prel ] .",
    "there is trivially a unique @xmath26-perfect code of length @xmath30 .",
    "zaremba  @xcite showed that also the @xmath26-perfect code of length @xmath31 is unique .",
    "however , already the next case of length @xmath0 has until this work withstood all attempts of complete classification , although several constructions of such codes have been published ; see the surveys  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these results were not far from a complete classification as for the number of codes found .",
    "the growth of the number of @xmath26-perfect binary codes is double exponential in the length of the code , see @xcite for a lower bound on this number . for an in - depth treatment of the topic of classifying combinatorial objects ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the current work is to obtain a complete classification of inequivalent @xmath26-perfect binary codes of length @xmath0 . by computer search",
    "it is here shown that their number is @xmath2 .",
    "also the codes obtained by extending , shortening or extending and shortening are classified ; the numbers of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath5 codes turn out to be @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "in the rest of the paper we document the classification of the extended 1-perfect codes of length @xmath1 , which yields classifications of the 1-perfect codes of length @xmath0 and the shortened 1-perfect codes of length @xmath4 . in section  [ sec : prel ] we define some concepts and consider construction of extended 1-perfect codes via steiner systems . in section",
    "[ sec : isom ] we present algorithms for detecting and rejecting equivalent codes , and in section  [ sec : results ] , we take a brief look at the results ; a separate , more detailed study of the classified codes will appear in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : check ] we give a consistency check for gaining confidence in the computational results .",
    "a permutation @xmath34 of the set @xmath35 acts on codewords by permuting the coordinates : @xmath36 .",
    "pairs @xmath37 form the _ wreath product _",
    "@xmath38 , which acts on codes as @xmath39 .",
    "two codes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are _ isomorphic _ if @xmath42 for some @xmath34 and _ equivalent _ if @xmath43 for some @xmath44",
    ".    the _ automorphism group _ of a code @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is the group of all pairs @xmath37 such that @xmath47 .",
    "two important subgroups of @xmath46 are the _ group of symmetries _ , @xmath48and the _ kernel _",
    "@xmath49 if the code contains the all - zero word , @xmath50 , then the elements of the kernel are codewords .    a _ steiner system _",
    "@xmath51 can be viewed as a code @xmath52 with the property that each codeword of @xmath53 has weight @xmath54 , and for any @xmath55 with @xmath56 , there is a unique @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "usually steiner systems are defined as set systems rather than codes , but our definition is more directly applicable for this work .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the _ order _ of the system .",
    "steiner systems @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which are called _ steiner triple systems _ and _ steiner quadruple systems _ , respectively , are related to 1-perfect codes in the following way . if @xmath45 is a 1-perfect binary code of length @xmath59 and @xmath62 , then the codewords of @xmath63 with weight @xmath30 form a steiner triple system of order @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath45 is an extended 1-perfect binary code and @xmath62 , then the codewords of @xmath63 with weight @xmath64 form a steiner quadruple system .",
    "these systems are , respectively , the _ neighborhood triple system _ and _ neighborhood quadruple system _ associated with the code and the codeword .    as a starting point for the classification of the extended 1-perfect binary codes of length 16",
    ", we have the classification  @xcite of steiner quadruple systems of order 16 ; there are @xmath65 such designs .",
    "we want to find , for each @xmath66 , all extended 1-perfect binary codes in which it occurs .",
    "this can be done by puncturing any coordinate , augmenting the resulting code to 1-perfect codes in all possible ways , and finally extending every resulting code with a parity bit .",
    "when augmenting a set of codewords to a 1-perfect code , we consider a 1-perfect code as a set of balls with radius one that form a partition of the ambient space .",
    "accordingly , finding a code ( with specified codewords ) is a special case of the _ exact cover problem _",
    ", where we are given a set @xmath53 and a collection @xmath67 of its subsets , and the task is to form a partition of @xmath53 by using sets in @xmath67 .",
    "let the set @xmath68 contain the codewords obtained by puncturing the all - zero codeword and its neighborhood quadruple system .",
    "in this case we have @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we use the _ libexact _ software  @xcite for solving such instances of the exact cover problems . in the search we could in fact",
    "have made use of the fact that all 1-perfect binary codes are self - complementary  in other words , the all - one word is always in the kernel  but this would not have had any practical significance as the search was rather fast .    since the all - zero word and",
    "its neighborhood quadruple system contain @xmath73 of the @xmath74 codewords , @xmath75 new codewords are needed .",
    "searching for these was a remarkably easy computational task ; on average the search trees in which codes were found had 1978 nodes and those in which no codes were found had 3 nodes .",
    "the general framework by mckay  @xcite was used to carry out isomorph rejection , although a less sophisticated method would have sufficed in this work .",
    "recall that we augment a steiner quadruple system @xmath68 to an extended 1-perfect code @xmath45 .",
    "we accept @xmath45 if it passes the following two tests ; otherwise it is rejected .",
    "first we require that @xmath45 shall be the minimum ( with respect to some practically computable total order of codes ) under the action of @xmath76 .",
    "second , we compute the canonical equivalence class representative @xmath77 , consider @xmath44 for which @xmath78 and require that @xmath11 and @xmath50 are on the same @xmath46 orbit ( we define @xmath79 so that @xmath62 always holds ) .",
    "when the extended 1-perfect codes have been classified , classifying the 1-perfect codes is straightforward .",
    "all 1-perfect codes are obtained by puncturing the extended codes , and the resulting 1-perfect codes are equivalent if and only if they are obtained by puncturing the same extended code at coordinates which are in the same orbit of the automorphism group .    a complete classification of the @xmath33 codes is obtained similarly , since each such code is obtained by shortening a unique ( up to equivalence ) 1-perfect code of length @xmath0 ; this result was proved by blackmore  @xcite .",
    "although a code can be shortened at any coordinate in two ways , by selecting the codewords with @xmath80 or @xmath26 in a certain coordinate , both selections lead to equivalent codes .",
    "this follows from the fact that every 1-perfect binary code is self - complementary .",
    "furthermore we note that any @xmath5 code is obtained by extending a @xmath33 code with a parity bit .",
    "hence all such codes are obtained by shortening and extending a perfect code , or equivalently removing all words of chosen parity .",
    "as the perfect codes are self - complementary , we get ( up to equivalence ) same code by chosing either odd or even parity . as this",
    "mapping is reversible , we conclude that there is one - to - one correspondence between equivalence classes of @xmath81 codes and equivalence classes of @xmath5 codes , and in both cases their number is @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath45 be a @xmath5 code @xmath45 and let @xmath82 be the corresponding perfect code .",
    "the group @xmath83 contains @xmath46 as a subgroup , and @xmath83 has one more generator than @xmath46 , namely the all - one codeword .",
    "accordingly @xmath84 .",
    "we still have to describe an algorithm for canonical labeling . the most straightforward approach of using the general purpose isomorphism _ nauty _",
    "@xcite is rather slow on codes as large and regular as the @xmath32 codes ; this was also noted by phelps  @xcite .",
    "hence a tailored approach is necessary .",
    "the method presented below has a lot in common with the one described in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative method based on minimum distance graphs would also work  @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a _ triangle _ consists of @xmath30 codewords with mutual distance @xmath64 .",
    "triangles constitute an easily computable and rather sensitive invariant of steiner quadruple systems . distinguishing the isomorphism classes of the neighborhood quadruple systems of a code",
    "also constitutes an invariant of the extended 1-perfect codes .",
    "these two invariants turned out to be useful for speeding up our computations .",
    "a canonical isomorphism class representative @xmath85 for a code @xmath45 can be computed by using _ nauty _ to label a corresponding graph canonically . moreover , _",
    "nauty _ computes generators of the group @xmath86 .",
    "canonical equivalence class representative can be defined as @xmath87 , where the minimum is again taken with respect to some practically computable total order of codes .",
    "note that two codewords , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are in the same orbit of @xmath46 if and only if @xmath88 .",
    "because of this , if we know that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are in the same orbit , and @xmath89 has been computed , then there is no need to compute @xmath90 . also if @xmath91 , then _ nauty",
    "_ yields a permutation @xmath34 such that @xmath92 .",
    "the pairs @xmath37 are coset representatives of @xmath46 with respect to @xmath86 , so we get generators of the group @xmath46 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath3 inequivalent extended 1-perfect codes of length @xmath1 , @xmath2 inequivalent 1-perfect codes of length @xmath0 , @xmath6 shortened 1-perfect codes of length @xmath4 and @xmath2 @xmath5 codes .",
    "the orders of the automorphism groups of the codes are presented in tables  [ tbl : extautorder ] , [ tbl : perfautorder ] and [ tbl : shortautorder ] . as noted in section  [ sec : isom ] , the order of the automorphism group of a @xmath5 code is half of the order of the automorphism group of the corresponding perfect code .",
    "the codes have been made available in electronic form by including them in the source of the arxiv version of this paper .",
    "downloading http://arxiv.org/e-print/0806.2513v3 and uncompressing it with gunzip and tar yields the files perfect15 and extended16 .",
    "only @xmath93 of the @xmath65 nonisomorphic @xmath66 can be augmented to a 1-perfect code , and the total number of extensions is @xmath94 .",
    "the computationally intensive part of this result was the earlier classification of @xmath66 , which required several years of cpu time , while all searches described in this paper took only a couple of hours of cpu time .",
    "a detailed study of the properties of the classified codes will appear in a second part of this article  @xcite .",
    ".automorphism groups of @xmath32 codes [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to get confidence in the results , we performed a consistency check similar to the one used , for example , in  @xcite . in this check",
    "we count the total number of codes in two different ways and ensure that the results agree .",
    "first we consider the set @xmath95 of equivalence class representatives obtained in the classification . by the orbit - stabilizer theorem ,",
    "the total number of extended 1-perfect codes is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the order of the wreath product group acting on the codes .",
    "let @xmath98 consist of the representative steiner quadruple systems , and let @xmath99 be the number of all extended 1-perfect codes obtained by augmenting @xmath68 . applying the orbit - stabilizer theorem",
    ", we get the expression @xmath100 where the division by @xmath74 is necessary since each code is counted once for each codeword .",
    "both formulas yield the same result , @xmath101 .",
    "similarly we also counted the 1-perfect codes and shortened 1-perfect codes in two different ways ; their number is @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , there are twice as many extended 1-perfect codes as there are 1-perfect codes , since each 1-perfect code admits two extensions : one with even parity bit and one with odd .",
    "similarly , we get a bijection from the 1-perfect codes to shortened 1-perfect codes if we shorten each code by taking , for instance , the codewords with value @xmath80 in coordinate @xmath0 and removing that coordinate .",
    "thus there are equally many 1-perfect codes and shortened 1-perfect codes .",
