    "the possibility that the crust of a rotating neutron star may sustain a `` mountain '' , thus creating a source of gravitational waves , has recently sparked much interest .",
    "this is mainly due to the suggestion by @xcite , echoing earlier ideas by @xcite and @xcite , that the gravitational wave torque due to such a mechanism may be dictating the spin equilibrium period for the lmxbs .",
    "a recent estimate of how large a quadrupole one may expect was given by @xcite , using the perturbation formalism of @xcite . from their work",
    "it appears that the quadrupole may be big enough to balance the accretion torque , if the breaking strain of the crust ( a very poorly constrained parameter ) is taken to be near the maximum of the possible values . even though other gravitational wave mechanisms have been suggested for these systems ( toroidal magnetic fields were suggested by @xcite and r - modes by @xcite ) , and even though one can build models of the interaction between the accretion disc and the magnetic field that give the correct distribution of spin frequencies , as in @xcite , the matter is still of great interest .",
    "there are in fact many questions that can still be asked , the main one being if there is a difference between the `` mountain '' that one can build on the non - accreted crust of a rotating neutron star and the one that can be built on the accreted crust of a neutron star in a binary system ( such as the lmxbs ) .",
    "we shall see that these two different scenarios can lead to significantly different compositions for the crust .",
    "the case of isolated neutron stars is particularly interesting as current gravitational wave detectors are beginning to put astrophysically relevant limits on the ellipticities of known pulsars ( @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we will discuss this issue , and present a new scheme for calculating the maximum quadrupole which allows us to have better control of the boundary conditions at the base of the crust than in the scheme of @xcite .",
    "another important point is that we do not adopt the cowling approximation , which , as we will show , can lead to significant differences in the results .",
    "we intend to present a formalism in terms of perturbations of a spherically symmetric crust , without making the cowling approximation that was made in @xcite .",
    "we will consider two cases for the crust core interface : in one case we will solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equations in the crust and in the core , and impose continuity of the tractions at the junction ; in the other case we consider the core to remain unperturbed , and thus spherical .",
    "this is not physical but , as we shall see , allows us to estimate the errors associated with neglecting the perturbations of the core .",
    "the main point , however , is that if we leave the core unperturbed , this allows us to solve the tov equations to obtain it s structure ; we can thus obtain an estimate of how important relativistic effects may be .",
    "such effects are relevant because , even though the newtonian approximation is excellent at the low densities of the crust , the structure of the core can be highly relativistic and have an impact on global parameters such as the mass and radius of the star .",
    "we shall first develop the formalism for an @xmath0 polytrope and then apply it to the case of a realistic equation of state , for an accreted and a non - accreted crust .",
    "in this section we shall briefly review the method of @xcite , who were the first to perform a detailed calculation to estimate the maximum size of a `` mountain '' that a neutron star crust could sustain . as it will be necessary to refer to it ,",
    "let us recapitulate briefly their work .",
    "let us assume that the crust responds elastically to pressure and density perturbations .",
    "we can thus treat it as a solid with a shear modulus @xmath1 and write the stress tensor as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is simply the flat 3-metric and @xmath4 is the shear stress tensor of the crust , which vanishes in the fluid interior .",
    "we will consider the equilibrium shape of the star to be spherical , thus effectively representing the deformation of a non - rotating star , and treat @xmath4 as a first order quantity , so that we have : @xmath5 the equations we need to solve for equilibrium are thus : @xmath6 where now @xmath7 indicates the background density and @xmath8 .",
    "if we expand the perturbation in tensor spherical harmonics , as in @xcite , we have : @xmath9 where @xmath10 where in equation [ corro ] we have corrected a typo of @xcite .    from this expansion one can calculate the quadrupole moment @xmath11 associated with the deformation @xmath12+\\frac{\\delta\\phi}{g(r)}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right\\}dr\\ ] ] in @xcite the authors now make the cowling approximation , thus choose to neglect the perturbations of the gravitational potential @xmath13 , and integrate by parts by imposing that the shear modulus @xmath14 vanishes at the base of the crust . with this condition",
    "the surface terms vanish and the final expression for the maximum quadrupole of @xcite is @xmath15dr \\label{quad}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to note that we have assumed that the surface terms in the integral vanish because we have assumed ( as in @xcite ) that the shear stress vanishes as we approach the base of the crust , however this is not an accurate description of the physical situation .",
    "the shear modulus in fact increases as one approaches the base of the crust from the exterior regions of the star ( as can be seen in figure [ mu ] ) and the transition to @xmath17 in the core may be very sharp ; in this case the surface terms may be important .",
    "up to now we have considered the purely elastic response of the crust .",
    "however real solids behave elastically only up to a maximum strain @xmath18 after which they either crack or deform plastically . in order to estimate the maximum size of the mountain that can be built",
    "we shall assume that the crust cracks upon reaching a certain yield strain .",
    "let us investigate this in detail , following once again @xcite .",
    "we will consider the strain tensor rather than the stress tensor , as this allows us to use a simple criterion to establish when the crust breaks .",
    "the strain tensor is defined as : @xmath19 where @xmath14 is the shear modulus .",
    "if we define @xmath20 as @xmath21 , the von mises criterion ( @xcite and references therein ) then states that the crust will yield when @xmath22 other criteria exist , such as the tresca criterion which depends on the difference between the maximum and minimum eigenvalue of the strain tensor , but they are expected to lead to similar qualitative results ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume the physical variables to be the real part of our complex variables we can write ( @xcite ) @xmath23 ^ 2+\\sigma_{r\\perp}^2[\\re(f_{ab})]^2+\\sigma_{\\lambda}^2[\\re(\\lambda_{ab}+\\frac{1}{2}y_{lm}e_{ab})]^2 \\label{i2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the components of the strain tensor along the tensor spherical harmonics defined in equation ( [ spando ] ) . by then assuming that the quadrupole is maximised when the equality of equation ( [ massi ] ) is satisfied , i.e. when @xmath27 , @xcite find that the maximum is obtained when : @xmath28 the von mises criterion , together with the expression for the maximum quadrupole in ( [ quad ] ) , thus allowed @xcite to conclude that the maximum quadrupole is @xmath29 no matter how the strain arises and under the assumption that all the strain is in the @xmath30 spherical harmonic ; strain in other harmonics would push the crust closer to the yield point without contributing to the quadrupole .",
    "this estimate is thus an upper limit for the quadrupole the crust could sustain , and on the energy the star would emit in gravitational waves , which is related to the quadrupole by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rotation rate of the star .",
    "the value @xmath33 was chosen because it puts @xmath34 in the right range to balance the accretion torque in the lmxbs , the quadrupole required to do this is in fact ( @xcite ) @xmath35 if we assume the most basic accretion torque model , as presented for example in @xcite .",
    "this would mean allowing the spin equilibrium periods of the lmxbs to be set by gravitational waves , and would explain the narrow distribution of such spin periods .",
    "it is , however , also possible to explain the spin distribution by using a more refined accretion torque model , that requires no gravitational waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "one should keep in mind that @xmath18 is a very poorly constrained parameter , expected to be in the range @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .",
    "having reviewed the formalism of @xcite , let us apply it to the problem of determining the maximum quadrupole that an accreted and a non - accreted crust can sustain , and present some of the issues involved .",
    "the maximum quadrupole defined in equation ( [ quad ] ) depends on an integral over the crust involving the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath14 ( which is contained in the components of the stress tensor @xmath38 ) .",
    "these quantities depend on the equation of state and composition of the crust , which are quite different in the accreted and non - accreted cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "the equation of state , for example , determines the thickness of the crust , while the composition of the crust determines the shear modulus ( @xcite ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fraction of neutrons outside nuclei , @xmath41 is the baryon density , @xmath42 is the proton number and @xmath43 is the atomic number .",
    "these quantities are plotted in figures [ crust ] and [ mu ] .",
    "one could then ask which kind of crust could support a larger deformation , which is the same as asking which kind of neutron star is potentially a `` better '' source of gravitational waves .",
    "it has been suggested that an accreted crust would sustain a smaller `` mountain '' as @xmath42 is much lower than in a non - accreted crust ( @xcite ) . to answer the question we can evaluate the expression in equation ( [ quad ] ) in the two cases , using the results of @xcite and @xcite for the composition and eos of the crust .",
    "the main obstacle is that the composition of the accreted crust is only given up to neutron drip density , because at higher densities the equation of state is basically that of a neutron gas , and thus can be matched to that of a non - accreted crust .",
    "however , even if the eos is the same , the composition ( specifically @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) is not ( @xcite ) . in order to obtain an estimate we have extrapolated the results available up to neutron drip density to higher densities by noting that the ratio @xmath44 is roughly constant in the two kinds of crust and assuming that it will remain so even in the denser regions at the base of the crust .",
    "having done this we can calculate the maximum quadrupole for the two cases . to do this",
    "we need to integrate the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium for the star ( as the core is unperturbed ) and we can use newtonian equations or the tov equations . we shall examine both cases in order to obtain an estimate of how important relativistic effects can be .",
    "the question is relevant , because even though relativistic effects are not very important in the crust , they do contribute significantly to the structure of the star , and thus affect parameters such as the crust thickness which are relevant for our calculation .",
    "it would then not seem appropriate to use realistic equations of state if we are still describing the core with newtonian equations of equilibrium , as the relativistic effects we are neglecting may be as large as the corrections we expect from the equation of state .",
    "we will always use newtonian equations in the crust .",
    "l |l |l |l & accreted crust&non accreted crust & accreted crust + tov & & & + mass & @xmath45 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 + radius & @xmath47 km&@xmath48 km&@xmath48 km + crust thickness&@xmath49 km&@xmath50 km&@xmath50 km + q@xmath51 & @xmath52&@xmath53&@xmath54 + @xmath55&1.1@xmath56&1.5@xmath56&7.3@xmath57 + newtonian & & & + mass & @xmath45 & @xmath45 & @xmath58 + radius & @xmath59 km&@xmath60 km&@xmath61 km + crust thickness&@xmath62 km&@xmath63 km&@xmath63 km + q@xmath51 & @xmath64&@xmath65&@xmath66 + @xmath55&1.6@xmath56&2.4@xmath56&1.1@xmath56 +    as we can see from table [ comparo1 ] the non - accreted crust allows for a slightly larger quadrupole , but the results are essentially the same for the two models .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the slight decrease in @xmath14 ( as seen in figure [ crust ] ) for the accreted crust is compensated for by it being thicker.we can try to compare the case of two stars with a crust of the same thickness and , as is obvious from table [ comparo1 ] , in this case there is approximately a factor 2 difference .",
    "this is close to what would be expected , as @xcite has predicted that the shear modulus of an accreted crust would be approximately half that of a non accreted crust , even if in reality this effect is counterbalanced by the accreted crust being thicker .",
    "however it is important to note that the result depends on how we extrapolate the composition at the base of the accreted crust . in order to confirm this result",
    "it would therefore be necessary to have a detailed calculation of the composition of the crust in this region . from table",
    "[ comparo1 ] , it is also clear that relativistic effects can play a role in this calculation , as they appear to make a difference of factors of up to a few in the final result ( mainly because the crust is thicker in the newtonian case , and the radius of the star is larger ) .         for an accreted and a non - accreted crust .",
    "the eos is taken from @xcite for the non - accreted case and from @xcite for the accreted case , and then extrapolated as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]   for an accreted and a non - accreted crust .",
    "the eos is taken from @xcite for the non - accreted case and from @xcite for the accreted case , and then extrapolated as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]",
    "following @xcite , in the previous calculation we adopted the cowling approximation .",
    "such an approximation is often used when discussing oscillations , in cases where one expects only the surface layers to take part in the motion . then the high density interior remains essentially unperturbed and one can neglect the effect of perturbations to the gravitational potential compared to other forces .",
    "we could expect this approximation to be valid also in our ( non - oscillatory ) context .",
    "this simplifies the calculation considerably , because it means that the liquid core of the star can not support any kind of perturbation ( with no shear and no @xmath13 there would be no restoring force for a pressure perturbation @xmath67 ) .",
    "this allows us to consider only the crust . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider the effect of the approximation and conclude that retaining the perturbations of the gravitational potential could lead to changes in the quadrupole from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "a calculation of the strain that arises in the crust , dropping the cowling approximation , is carried out by @xcite , but for the case of a perturbation with a @xmath70 angular dependance , given by rotation . in order to investigate the effects of such an approximation for our problem we will present a series of model calculations where the @xmath13 terms have been retained .",
    "these simple examples can be solved analytically and allow us to estimate how much the cowling approximation can affect the final solution .",
    "let us first of all consider a constant density , elastic sphere .",
    "in this case we will have @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the heaviside step function and we have taken the shear modulus constant over the whole star rather than just the crust , in order to make the algebra simpler .",
    "@xmath73 is the stellar radius .",
    "in addition to equation ( [ elas ] ) we now need to solve the perturbed poisson equation @xmath74 let us examine the source term containing @xmath75 . take for the components of the strain tensor the maximum from ( [ maxsol ] ) .",
    "this means that the stress tensor is simply @xmath76 and depends on @xmath77 only through @xmath14 .",
    "if we assume that the crust is everywhere strained to the maximum and insert our definitions for @xmath14 and @xmath7 into equation ( [ elas ] ) we obtain @xmath78+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\theta(r - r)}{g(r)}\\left[\\frac{3}{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{32\\pi}{15}}\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\max}-\\frac{\\beta}{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{16\\pi}{5}}\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\max}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\&&-\\frac{\\delta^{'}(r - r)}{g(r)}\\frac{r}{\\beta}\\sqrt{\\frac{16\\pi}{5}}\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\max}-\\frac{\\delta(r - r)}{g(r)}\\rho\\delta\\phi \\label{complete}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    returning to poisson s equation , in the @xmath79 case we have to solve : @xmath80,\\ ] ] subject to the conditions that the solution should be regular at the centre of the star , fall off at infinity and be continuous at the surface of the star .",
    "the step in the first derivative of @xmath13 can be computed by integrating between @xmath81 and @xmath82 and then taking the limit @xmath83 ; this gives @xmath84\\ ] ] the solutions of the homogeneous equation are of the form @xmath85 we then clearly have @xmath86 for the interior and @xmath87 for the exterior . matching at the surface gives us @xmath88 which can be used to compute the step in the first derivative and obtain the interior solution @xmath89 we can now substitute this back into equation ( [ complete ] ) and calculate :    @xmath90\\equiv q_{sh}+q_{\\phi}\\label{qphi}\\ ] ]    which gives us the ratio @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the part of the quadrupole we would get in the cowling approximation and @xmath93 is the part that comes from the terms involving @xmath13 , as defined in equation ( [ qphi ] ) .",
    "it would thus appear that , in this case , by making the cowling approximation we could overestimate @xmath94 by a factor of 2 .",
    "let us see what this means in terms of the ellipticity @xmath95 . we can write the torque acting on a constant density ellipsoid as @xmath96 however we can also write this as @xmath97 if we compare these two expressions we see that , in the constant density case @xmath98 let us take as canonical values @xmath99 @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xmath102 , @xmath103 @xmath104 . substituting these into the above expression gives @xmath105      a slight improvement one can make is to impose that the shear modulus vanishes outside the crust . we will still take a constant density but we shall take @xmath14 of the form : @xmath106\\ ] ] the calculation is similar to the previous one , but we now have to match the solutions at @xmath73 and @xmath107 and impose the step in the derivative at these two points .",
    "it is in fact important to note that as we now have a step at the base of the crust , this will lead to surface terms when we take derivatives of the shear modulus .",
    "these terms are important , as they are not present in the calculation of @xcite , where @xmath108 at the base of the crust . from this calculation",
    "we obtain @xmath109 again , the ratio between the two is @xmath91 and @xmath110 in terms of @xmath55 we have @xmath111 which gives us , for the canonical values we have chosen and @xmath112 @xmath104 : @xmath113 which is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the previous result for the elastic sphere .",
    "so the shell is , as is intuitive , `` weaker '' than the sphere .",
    "a slightly more realistic model is that given by an @xmath0 polytrope @xmath114 which leads to the density profile : @xmath115 let us still take @xmath116 $ ] with @xmath14 constant .",
    "the homogeneous poisson equation thus becomes , in the interior : @xmath117 which admits solutions of the form @xmath118+\\\\ & & + \\frac{b}{r^3}\\left[(3r^2-\\pi^2r^2)\\sin{(\\pi r / r)}-3\\pi rr\\cos{(\\pi r / r)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by expanding this solution with a power series around the origin we can see that the regular part is that involving the constant @xmath119 ( thus @xmath120 ) .",
    "this must be matched with the whole solution at @xmath107 , and we must then match with the exterior solution @xmath121 at the stellar surface @xmath73 . finally we must impose the steps in the derivative at @xmath107 and @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting solution is quite complicated , but leads to @xmath122 for a radius @xmath73=10 km and a crust thickness of 1 km .",
    "examining the ratio @xmath123 for different values of the crust thickness leads to very similar results and allows us to conclude that including @xmath13 always slightly increases the value of the quadrupole .",
    "if we now calculate an @xmath55 we obtain : @xmath111 which gives us , with typical parameters for the crust and @xmath112 @xmath104 , @xmath124 which is an order of magnitude larger than in the constant density cases .",
    "let us finally take a slightly more realistic model with a density dependent shear .",
    "we will take @xmath125 to be constant which , as shown in figure [ musurho ] , is not a bad approximation .",
    "this gives us @xmath126 where the step function ensures that the shear modulus vanishes in the core ( @xmath107 is the radius at the base of the crust ) .",
    "there is no need for a step at the surface , as the density goes to zero there anyway .",
    "we will take @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "as in the previous section we will take the equation of state to be an @xmath0 polytrope , thus obtaining : @xmath129 the components of the stress tensor will now also depend on @xmath77 through the shear modulus .",
    "@xmath130 the procedure we have to follow is identical to that of the previous sections , we have to solve poisson s equation in the core , in the crust and outside the star .",
    "we must then impose the boundary conditions at the edge of these regions .",
    "these are the same as in the preceding sections , i.e. we need to impose the continuity of @xmath13 and the step in the derivative at the base of the crust .",
    "this allows us to compute the part of the quadrupole that comes from the perturbations of the gravitational potential @xmath93 . for our canonical values",
    "we have @xmath131 we must also calculate the quadrupole that comes from the shear terms alone .",
    "as we have mentioned before this contribution involves derivatives of the stress tensor , it also involves delta functions and their derivatives .",
    "this means that we have two contributions : a surface term that comes from such delta functions and a term that comes from the interior integration .",
    "let us examine this case in more detail , as it is a good example of how important the surface terms can be",
    ".    for the stellar parameters given above we find that the integral term is : @xmath132 while the surface term has opposite sign and gives @xmath133 the two thus add up to @xmath134 the large cancellations due to the surface term lead to a total quadrupole where the dominant contribution is that given by the perturbations of the gravitational potential @xmath135 corresponding to an @xmath55 of @xmath136 which is smaller than the previous result and is a direct consequence of the cancellations that occur at the base of the crust .",
    "it is thus quite clear that the correct treatment of the boundary can have an important effect on this calculation .",
    "in particular it would appear that one can not take @xmath137 at the base of the crust , as the step is actually quite sharp ( as shown in figure [ mu ] ) and we have seen that this can lead to large surface terms .",
    "we can , however , conclude , similarly to @xcite , that including the perturbations of the gravitational potential @xmath13 will affect the results by a factor @xmath138-@xmath139 .",
    "thus the cowling approximation is not consistent , as the corrections given by @xmath140 are not negligible .",
    "it must , however , be noted that when we drop the cowling approximation we are no longer guaranteed that the components of the strain tensor calculated in ( [ elas ] ) will give us the maximum quadrupole .",
    ", which is taken to be constant in our approximation , is plotted for the case of a non - accreted crust ( the case of an accreted crust is qualitatively similar ) .",
    "as we can see it is approximately constant to within factors of two.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]",
    "up to now we have followed the method of @xcite and simply taken the crust to be strained to the maximum throughout . however , as we have seen previously , the boundaries can have a strong impact on the result , so in order to carefully impose the boundary conditions at the surface of the star and at the base of the crust let us reformulate the problem in terms of perturbations in the crust .",
    "we shall impose ( in a similar way as was done to calculate rotational deformations in the slow - rotation approximation , as presented for example in @xcite ) that the star has a small quadrupolar deformation , such that we can define a new variable @xmath141 which is a function of the radial variable of the spherical background model @xmath142.\\ ] ] we shall assume that @xmath143 labels the equipotential surfaces of the gravitational potential ( which will thus have the same deformed shape ) .",
    "it is important to note that in the core these surfaces also describe the `` isobaric '' and `` isopycnic '' surfaces .",
    "this is a consequence of the hydrostatic equations . in the crust , where we also have elastic terms",
    ", this is no longer true . in the crust ,",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath144 are not surfaces of constant density , so while @xmath55 is a good variable to use for the integration , it does not represent the `` shape '' of the star , which can be obtained by calculating the perturbations of the density ( @xmath75 ) or of the pressure ( as we will assume the equation of state to be barotropic ) .",
    "we expand the displacement vector along the orthonormal basis formed by the radial unit vector @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "this allows us to use a flat background 3-metric @xmath3 .",
    "we shall ignore the axial part , proportional to @xmath148 as this does not couple to the scalar perturbations such as @xmath75 which are proportional to @xmath149 .",
    "the displacement vector thus takes the form :    @xmath150    if we assume that the crust responds elastically it is useful to define the stress - energy tensor of the solid @xmath151 by @xmath152 where we have defined the trace - free tensor @xmath153 which describes the shear stress in the solid .",
    "this allows us to write the equations of static balance as @xmath154 which we can also write in the form @xmath155 where we have introduced the enthalpy @xmath156 we also have to supply a barotropic equation of state @xmath157 the remaining equations we need are the continuity equation and poisson s equation @xmath158 and the condition that the unit vector @xmath159 given by the new radial variable is orthogonal to the equipotential surfaces of @xmath144 , or parallel the gradient of @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath160 it is important to note again that @xmath141 is not related to the shape of the star ( as the deformations of the density are ) because we now have elastic terms in our equations of force balance .",
    "however the introduction of the variable @xmath161 makes the equations for @xmath13 more tractable numerically .",
    "we will now carry out first order perturbations , treating @xmath162 as a first order quantity .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that the background spherical configuration is at zero strain .",
    "we could imagine this to be plausible for a star which has been spun down by dipole radiation and been in an essentially non rotating configuration long enough for plastic flow to relax the crust .",
    "if this star then starts accreting it would be spun up and correspond to the situation we are describing .",
    "it is of course not relevant for the case of a spinning down star with a crust that formed while it was rapidly rotating and for which the reference zero - strain configuration would not be spherical .",
    "this problem is , however , a much more complicated one , as it would require us to know the reference shape of the star , which will in general depend on the history of the crust .",
    "we shall assume that every perturbation has a @xmath30 angular dependance , i.e. is of the form @xmath163 .",
    "this is because we are interested in the quadrupolar part of @xmath75 which will give the dominant contribution for gravitational waves .",
    "however it is worthwhile noting that , even though they do not contribute to the gravitational wave emission , perturbations with a different angular dependance ( e.g. a @xmath70 deformation due to rotation ) still build up stress in the crust , and bring it closer to the breaking point , thus allowing a smaller quadrupolar deformation .",
    "for example , there could be a strong @xmath70 deformation , as the star is rotating , and this could build up high levels of strain in the crust .",
    "it is not however easy to evaluate this quantitatively , as the exact level of strain depends on the reference shape of the crust ( the unstrained configuration ) , which in turn depends on the history of the star .",
    "let us then write the perturbation equations we need ( @xmath164 ) :    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     it would appear from the results of our calculations that considering the perturbations of the core can make a difference in the result , mainly for thin crusts . on the other hand it appears that if the crust is thick , then the crustal quadrupole plays a predominant role , and",
    "is well approximated by taking a perturbed crust on top of an unperturbed core . in this case",
    "relativistic effects can become important , and it would then not seem appropriate to use realistic equations of state , but still describe the core with newtonian equations of equilibrium . on the other hand it would seem to be the case that one can consider an unperturbed relativistic core ( with a realistic eos ) ,",
    "then use a realistic eos and @xmath14 in the newtonian crust and still have a reasonable approximation to the full problem .",
    "we are of course still solving the problem in newtonian elasticity , so not solving the problem in `` full '' gr , but at the densities of the crust the newtonian approximation is a reasonable one , and makes the problem considerably simpler than it would be in relativistic elasticity .          and on the mass of the star , in the case of a perturbed core . for this case",
    "we plot also the single contributions of the crust and the core.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]   and on the mass of the star , in the case of a perturbed core . for this case",
    "we plot also the single contributions of the crust and the core.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]          we can now consider the stellar models presented in table [ comparo1 ] for two stars , one with a non - accreted crust and one with an accreted crust .",
    "we shall first take the two stars to have the same mass , then we shall also consider two stars with the same crust thickness . as the crust is now thick , as shown in table [ comparo1 ] , we expect the crustal quadrupole to dominate and can thus consider the approximation of an unperturbed core to be reasonable .",
    "this then allows us to use the equation of state given by @xcite and solve the tov equations in the core and the newtonian equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the crust , thus taking relativistic effects into account .",
    "the results are shown in table [ nuova1 ] .",
    "as expected the values for the quadrupole do not differ significantly .",
    "we also confirm that a neutron star with an non accreted crust could provide a slightly better source of gravitational waves , as was expected from the literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the quadrupole ( or equivalently the ellipticity ) are now larger than in the previous case as we are taking a realistic model for the shear modulus ( as shown in figure [ mu ] ) .",
    "this leads to values of @xmath14 which are significantly larger than in the constant ratio @xmath125 approximation , especially in the higher density regions close to the base of the crust , which give rise to most of the quadrupole .",

    "we have reviewed the method of @xcite to determine the maximum deformation that a neutron star crust can sustain .",
    "this procedure has then been applied to the case of an accreted and a non - accreted crust , in order to estimate whether one of the two would produce a better source of gravitational waves .",
    "it appears that the two kinds of crust are essentially equivalent , with the non - accreted crust being able to support a slightly larger quadrupole , as has been suggested in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that to obtain this result is has been necessary to extrapolate the composition of the crust in the high density regions at the base of the accreted crust . in order to confirm this result",
    "it would therefore be necessary to have a precise model for the composition in this region .",
    "we have then examined a series of toy models , to determine what effect the cowling approximation can have on the problem and , more crucially , if it is safe to assume that the shear modulus @xmath137 at the base of the crust . we conclude that this is not the case , as the shear modulus is expected to vanish over a thin transition region close to the base of the crust , which can lead to large boundary terms .",
    "the cowling approximation can also make a difference of factors of a few in the final result .    in order to drop the cowling approximation , and have better control over the boundary conditions ,",
    "we have developed a perturbation formalism and applied it to the case of an @xmath0 polytrope with a constant ratio @xmath125 .",
    "the results of these tests have confirmed that the cowling approximation used in @xcite can have a large impact .",
    "our results , however , also suggest that it is not a bad approximation to consider an unperturbed core and perturb the crust , if the crust is sufficiently thick .",
    "this allows us to solve relativistic equations in the core , which can give corrections that are significant if we intend to use a realistic equation of state for the star .",
    "having developed the formalism we apply it to the original problem of the accreted and non - accreted crusts , with a realistic model for @xmath14 , thus confirming that the two crusts can sustain very similar quadrupoles , the non accreted crust being able to sustain a slightly larger `` mountain '' .",
    "what is surprising is the fact that the quadrupole found with this formalism is approximately an order of magnitude greater than the results obtained with the formalism of @xcite .",
    "such a significant quadrupole , if it were confirmed , may allow us to put an upper limit on the breaking strain of the crust from observations . the problem , however , is not quite so simple .",
    "the calculations we have presented give a `` maximum '' quadrupole in as much as we have assumed all the strain to be in the @xmath30 harmonic . but the stars we consider are rotating and must therefore be rotationally deformed , thus putting strain also in the @xmath70 harmonic , as spin - up or spin - down moves the star away from its reference shape .",
    "this could bring the crust much closer to the yield point and significantly decrease the size of any additional `` mountain '' that it could sustain .",
    "unfortunately , estimating exactly how much strain is built up by rotation is a complicated problem , as the unstrained configuration of the crust depends on the history of the crust , and there may have been many starquakes during the spin - down and subsequent spin - up phases .",
    "however , if a neutron star can sustain a quadrupole this large for a breaking strain of @xmath33 , it would appear that even if the breaking strain is smaller there is still a possibility that the quadrupole may be large enough for gravitational waves to have a role in the spin evolution of the star .",
    "finally we should note that our approach was chosen in order to obtain a `` maximization '' argument , independent of the mechanism that produces the deformation , and to show that overall relativistic effects can be important .",
    "we have , therefore , integrated a set of source free equations , analogous to those of @xcite , with the deformation as a boundary condition .",
    "it would , however , be important to understand the physical processes that cause the deformation and integrate the same equations with a source , such as the temperature or composition variations used in @xcite .",
    "another important effect we are neglecting is that of the magnetic field .",
    "it is well known that the equilibrium shape of a star will not be spherical in the presence of a magnetic field and , even though crustal effects may be dominant early on during accretion , the process of magnetic burial could make the field locally strong enough for the magnetic deformations to become important .",
    "this effect was recently studied by @xcite and @xcite , who were the first to perform globally self - consistent mhd calculations of magnetic mountains on accreting ns as gravitational wave sources .",
    "these calculations did not include crustal effects ( as this would make the problem much less tractable ) , nevertheless it is important to note here that if one were to solve the full inhomogeneous problem , including the magnetic source terms ( or terms due to other physical process we have neglected ) , one could obtain deformations larger than the crustal maximum we have calculated .",
    "it would also be of some interest to consider the full problem in a relativistic formulation of elasticity , such as that of @xcite , as we have shown that the perturbations of the core can be important , especially in determining the dependence of the maximum quadrupole on the stellar parameters .",
    "we intend to turn our attention to these problems in the near future ."
