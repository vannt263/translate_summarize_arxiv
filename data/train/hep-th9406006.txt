    "it is well known that in field theory the perturbative series diverge @xcite and are asymptotic at best so that the question of the reliability of the perturbative expansion is raised .",
    "in particular the factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients has been related to the existence of instanton solutions @xcite and , in this way , a great number of results has been found ( for a review see @xcite ) . the perturbative expansion for renormalizable field theories is plagued by further divergences , the so - called renormalons , which show up as singularities on the real axis of the borel transform of the perturbative series @xcite . moreover",
    "this kind of problems has recently gained a great interest @xcite and many questions , mainly concerning the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative expansions in qcd , still wait for an answer .",
    "the standard technique to cope with divergent series is the introduction of the borel transform .",
    "if a function @xmath0 admits an asymptotic expansion and satisfies certain analytic properties @xcite , it can be uniquely reconstructed from the borel transform @xmath1 defined by : f()=^_0dbe^-b/(b)[borel ] the presence of singularities ( poles or cuts ) on the positive real axis of the borel transform forces to give a contour prescription ( for example a principal value prescription ) in order to define the perturbative expansion via the integral ( [ borel ] ) .",
    "this results in an ambiguity in the sum of the perturbative series given by the integration above and below the positive real axis in the borel plane .    to be definite , a singularity of the form :",
    "( b)~ gives rise to an imaginary part in the function @xmath2 of the form : f()~^se^-b_0/[im ] which in turn is related , via a dispersion relation , to the large order behaviour of the coefficients @xmath3 of the perturbative series : f_n~_n const()^nn^s(n - s)[largeorder ] the renormalon - type singularities occurr for b_0=n/_2[poles ] where @xmath4 is a positive integer and @xmath5 is the first term of the @xmath6-function and the sign plus refers to the ultraviolet renormalons while the sign minus to the infrared ones .",
    "these divergences are usually the closest ones to the origin and give the leading asymptotics for the perturbative series .    in the following we want to study the structure and a possible classification of the singularities due to renormalons , in the framework of qed with a large number of flavours @xcite .",
    "the aim of the first part of the paper is to present a prescription which could allow to take sistematically into account the imaginary parts ( see eq .",
    "( [ i m ] ) ) coming from ultraviolet renormalons .",
    "the idea stems from a conjecture made for the first time by parisi for the @xmath7 theory @xcite and explicitly checked in the @xmath8 limit of this theory @xcite .",
    "this conjecture relates the imaginary parts coming from the renormalon at @xmath9 to the insertion at zero momentum of local operators of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "renormalization group arguments fix the form of the imaginary parts from which the asymptotic behaviour ( [ largeorder ] ) is extracted ( with given @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) up to an overall normalization constant .",
    "we implement this conjecture adding gauge - invariant operators as imaginary counterterms in the lagrangian .",
    "the feasibility of such a description for the renormalon - type singularities relies on the fulfilment of two conditions :    * a unique choice must exist for the operators in order to remove the imaginary parts of all green functions . * in the effective theory described by the lagrangian with the counterterms , non local singularities in the borel transformed green functions must be absent .    the second half of the paper concerns the problem of infrared renormalons @xcite .",
    "in the case of qcd a connection has been conjectured between infared renormalons and the admissible multilocal gauge - invariant operators which can be seen as the dual of the local operators of the theory @xcite . then from the absence of local gauge - invariant operators of dimension two , the absence of the infrared renormalon at @xmath13 has been argued .",
    "recently the possibility of the existence of this renormalon has been raised @xcite and this would suggest the presence of a @xmath14 term in the operator product expansion for euclidean correlation functions @xcite and would spoil the connection with the gauge - invariant operators .",
    "while on general grounds this possibility can not be ruled out , an explicit calculation @xcite shows that this pole does nt indeed exist within the @xmath15 expansion for qed .",
    "moreover qcd is believed to have the same behaviour of qed after replacing the right @xmath5 coefficient .    in the spirit of the calculation of @xcite we study the structure of the first infrared renormalons in qed .",
    "in particular we find the form of the multilocal counterterms compensating the imaginary parts arising from infrared renormalons and , in connection with the case of the ultraviolet renormalons , we check that a unique prescription can be given .",
    "a short comment is in order about the use of the @xmath15 expansion .",
    "this kind of expansion is the natural framework for the study of renormalons in that it provides a graphic tool ( see figures ) for the investigation of these problems limit ; on the other hand the calculations performed in our paper are at fixed order in @xmath15 . ] .",
    "moreover it allows a partial resummation of the perturbative series so that one can obtain informations on the whole series and calculate quantities , like the overall normalization constant in ( [ largeorder ] ) , which can not be found at any finite order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii",
    "we introduce the notations and study the problem of the first ultraviolet renormalon .",
    "we find the explicit form of the counterterms and we check that all singularities can be absorbed in such a way .",
    "moreover we verify that the non local singularities which appear in the naive perturbation theory are indeed absent when considering the lagrangian with the counterterms . in sect.iii",
    "we perform similar calculations for the infrared renormalons ; the main difference is that , in this case , the operators to be added to the lagrangian are multilocal .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to some considerations about the meaning of the lagrangian with the imaginary counterterms .",
    "finally , the appendix contains some technical details about the calculations with the background field formalism .",
    "let us begin this section with the introduction of some definitions about the @xmath15 expansion in qed .    defining a rescaled coupling constant @xmath16 ,",
    "the @xmath15 expansion is generated , at fixed @xmath17 , by considering a factor of @xmath18 for every interaction vertex and a factor of @xmath19 for every closed fermion loop .",
    "then the photon propagator is given at leading order by the sum of the bubble diagrams ( fig.1 ) .",
    "in the landau gauge it reads : d_(k)=-d(k ) where : d(k)=[phprop ] and @xmath20 is the single bubble diagram . in the following we are interested in the high momentum region of integration in the feynman integrals",
    "; so we need the expression of @xmath20 in the deep euclidean region .",
    "after renormalization in the @xmath21 scheme , we have ( all fermions are assumed to have the same mass ) : _ 0 ( k ) _ km-\\ { log - } + + o ( ) from ( [ phprop ] ) and the definition ( [ borel ] ) one can easily derive the expression for the borel transform , with respect to @xmath17 , of the photon propagator ; introducing an extra factor of @xmath17 , we have : f(k , b)(k , b)_km e^-5b/9()^b/3[effe ]      at next - to - leading order in @xmath15 , the green functions correspond to the graphs with one insertion of the chain of the bubbles ( fig.2 - 4 ) and present renormalon - type singularities .",
    "in fact the feynman integrals , in which the photon propagator ( [ phprop ] ) appears in the integrand , have an ambiguity arising from the region of integration around the landau pole ( i.e. the pole in ( [ phprop ] ) ) which occurr , for infrared free theories ( in our case @xmath22 ) in the ultraviolet region : ^2=^2e^5/3 e^1/_2 a[lanpole ] ( we are always assuming the @xmath21 scheme ) .",
    "this ambiguity causes the green functions to develop an imaginary part and is related to the leading factorial growth of the coefficients of the perturbative series in @xmath23 .",
    "in fact it turns out that , after expanding ( [ phprop ] ) in powers of @xmath23 , the coefficient of order @xmath4 receives a contribution proportional to @xmath24 from the ultraviolet region of integration .",
    "these problems appear as poles on the real positive axis of the borel transformed green functions .    in the following we intend to find the behaviour of the borel transform of the vertex function , of the electron propagator and of the photon vacuum polarization near the first ultraviolet renormalon at @xmath25 .",
    "this will enable us to find the imaginary part of these functions and to study the connection with local gauge - invariant operators of dimension six .",
    "let us begin with the borel transform of the vertex function ( fig.2 ) . in the euclidean space",
    "the term of order @xmath15 is given by : = - f(k , b)[gamma ] where we have factorized out the electron charge @xmath26 .",
    "renormalization is taken into account by simply introducing the renormalized bubble .",
    "in fact , since we are working in the landau gauge , the vertex function needs no further renormalization and this results in the absence of a pole in @xmath27 in @xmath28 as written in ( [ gamma ] ) . moreover introducing the term of order @xmath29 in the expansion ( [ effe ] ) of @xmath30 results in a pole in @xmath28 at @xmath31 .",
    "after some manipulations with @xmath32 matrices and performing the integral we obtain for the first pole : _",

    "= q^2_hence there is no contribution of the first ultraviolet renormalon to the large order behaviour of the perturbative series of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , in agreement with the asymptotic behaviour found in @xcite .    from ( [ imver ] ) we see that the imaginary parts arising from different renormalons are classified , at this order in @xmath15 , in terms of the renormalization group invariant ( i.e. @xmath34-independent ) @xmath35-parameter which plays the role of a dimensional expansion parameter .",
    "it must be noted that this parameter encloses all the dependence of the calculation from the choice of the renormalization scheme .",
    "similar considerations hold for the fermion propagator ( fig.3 ) .",
    "its borel transform at order @xmath15 reads : ( p , b)= f(k , b ) isolating the pole at @xmath25 we have : ( p , b)_b~3()^b/3\\ { -m^2+m^3-p^2 + } this yields an imaginary part given by : ( p ) = \\{-m^2-p^2+m^3}+o()[imself ] it is straightforward to verify that ( [ imver ] ) and ( [ imself ] ) satisfy the ward identity : q _ im()= im(p^)-im(p)[ward ]    finally , the imaginary part of the photon vacuum polarization can be deduced from beneke @xcite .",

    "its role will be discussed in the following .",
    "our basic result is the explicit value of the imaginary parts of the vertex function ( eq.([imver ] ) ) , of the fermion propagator ( eq.([imself ] ) ) and of the photon vacuum polarization ( eq.([impol ] ) ) in correspondence of the first ultraviolet renormalon .",
    "we want to stress again that all our calculations have been performed at fixed order in @xmath15 and all the following considerations rely upon this kind of expansion in which renormalon - type problems have a more direct interpretation .",
    "let us now turn to the main point of our investigation i.e. the connection with local gauge - invariant operators .",
    "on simply dimensional grounds and exploiting renormalization group arguments one can argue that the imaginary parts given by ( [ imver ] ) , ( [ imself ] ) and ( [ impol ] ) are proportional to the insertion of operators of dimension six .",
    "we want to check if it is possible to give a prescription in terms of local gauge - invariant operators added as imaginary counterterms in the lagrangian .",
    "let us study the structure of the counterterms .",

    "2=-i|(i - e)[delta2 ]    the fundamental check involves the imaginary part of the photon vacuum polarization which contains a term proportional to log@xmath44 .",
    "in fact this term can not be cancelled by the direct insertion of a local operator but ought to arise from the insertion of a local operator in a loop diagram .",
    "one can easily convince himself that the only operator that can do this job must have the form of ( [ delta1 ] ) .",
    "we then compute the insertion of @xmath45 on the vacuum polarization as given by the diagram of fig.5 .",
    "this diagram is of order @xmath15 since it contains a term @xmath15 from @xmath46 , a term @xmath15 from the two vertices and a term @xmath19 from the fermion loop .",
    "it gives the following contribution to the imaginary part of the vacuum polarization ( in the @xmath21 scheme ) : i(q_q_-q^2g_)(log- ) this contribution exactly cancels the logarithmic term in im@xmath47 .    to summarize ,",
    "we have explicitly checked that , at next - to - leading order in @xmath15 , the imaginary parts due to the ultraviolet renormalon at @xmath25 can be cancelled by the contribution of local gauge - invariant operators of dimension six .",
    "indeed it is possible to give a realization of this connection at lagrangian level .",
    "in this section we deal with the so - called infrared renormalons i.e. singularities on the real axis of the borel transform at @xmath48 which arise from the low momentum region of integration in the feynman integrals .",
    "as already stated these singularities are on the negative real axis of the borel variable for infrared free theories like qed or qcd in the limit of large number of flavours and give rise to a sign alternating borel summable contribution to the perturbative series ( see eq.([largeorder ] ) ) .    on the contrary , for asymptotically free theories like qcd the infrared renormalons destroy the borel summability of the perturbative series , a phenomenon usually related to the presence of non - perturbative effects , the condensates , which cause the physical vacuum to have a non trivial structure .",
    "hence the study of infrared renormalons in qcd is of primary interest expecially for the comprehension of the operator product expansion which is usually introduced in order to parametrize non - perturbative effects @xcite .",
    "neverthless it is common wisdom that the structure of the infrared renormalons in qcd can be obtained from the study of qed , after the substitution of the value of @xmath5 of qcd .",
    "this means that the structure of the infrared renormalons is insensitive to the presence of non - perturbative contributions in the operator product expansion which in the case of qed is a pure reorganization of the perturbative series but depends only on the nature of the gauge - invariant operators of the theory , in agreement with the conjecture made by parisi @xcite .    in the following we intend to perform an explicit check of the connection with gauge - invariant operators , in analogy with the calculations of the previous section concerning ultraviolet renormalons .",
    "the basic difference in the case of infrared renormalons is that this connection can be implemented by adding imaginary multilocal gauge - invariant operators to the lagrangian .",
    "these multilocal operators must be considered as the `` dual '' of the local operators appearing in the operator product expansion ( for a rigorous definition see @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to find the form and the normalization of these operators and to check the combinatoric .    in analogy with the preceding section we deal with qed at next - to - leading order in @xmath15 .",
