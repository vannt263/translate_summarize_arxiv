    "the final test of the _ kepler _ photometer at the end of commissioning was a run of 9.7 continuous days in science mode , to evaluate the noise performance of the instrument .",
    "the _ kepler input catalog _ ( kic ) was used to select fifty thousand isolated targets , all with magnitudes brighter than 13.8 in the _ kepler _ passband , and with no nearby companions that would contaminate the photometry .",
    "the preliminary light curves from this test run were inspected by team members with great excitement , and a few dozen obvious planet candidates were quickly identified and passed on to the team responsible for ground - based follow - up observations . kepler-7was observed but was not identified among the sample of initial candidates .    after a gap of 1.3 days",
    ", normal science observations began for a full list of more than 150,000 planet - search targets and continued for 33.5 days until interrupted on 15 june 2009 , followed by a data download and roll of the spacecraft to the summer orientation . by the middle of july",
    "the preliminary light curves were available for inspection , and dozens of additional candidates were identified and passed on to the follow - up team .",
    "this time kepler-7  was included .",
    "along with the other candidates , kepler-7  was scrutinized for evidence of astrophysical false positives involving eclipsing binaries .",
    "it survived this stage of the follow up and was then observed spectroscopically for very precise radial velocities using the fiber - fed echelle spectrograph ( fies ) on the nordic optical telescope ( not ) during a ten night run in early october .",
    "these observations yielded a spectroscopic orbit that confirmed that an unseen companion with a planetary mass was responsible for the dips in the light curve observed by _",
    "the kic used ground - based multi - band photometry to assign an effective temperature and surface gravity of @xmath7 k and @xmath8(cgs ) to kepler-7 , corresponding to a late f or early g dwarf .",
    "stellar gravities in this part of the h - r diagram are notoriously difficult to determine from photometry alone , and one of the conclusions of this paper is that the star is near the end of its main sequence lifetime , with a radius that has expanded to @xmath9 and a surface gravity that has weakened to @xmath10(cgs ) . in turn",
    "this implies an inflated radius for the planet , resulting in an unusually low density of @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is hard to avoid , because the relatively long duration of the transit , more than 5 hours from first to last contact , demands a low density and expanded radius for the star .",
    "the light curve for kepler-7  (= kic  5780885 , @xmath11 , j2000 , kic @xmath12mag ) is plotted in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "the numerical data are available electronically from the multi mission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) high level science products ( hlsp ) website .",
    "only a modest amount of detrending has been applied @xcite to this time series of long cadence data ( 29.4-minute accumulations ) .",
    "there is no evidence for any systematic difference between alternating events , which are plotted with @xmath13 and @xmath14 symbols , supporting the interpretation that all the events are primary transits .",
    "indeed , there _ is _ weak evidence for a secondary eclipse centered at phase 0.5 , as would be expected for a circular orbit , but the significance is only about @xmath15 .",
    "if this detection is real , it is not inconsistent with the thermal emission expected from the planet for reasonable assumptions @xcite .",
    "as described in more detail by @xcite , the initial follow - up observations of _ kepler _ planet candidates involved reconnaissance spectroscopy to look for evidence of a stellar companion or a nearby eclipsing binary responsible for the observed transits . however , the follow - up team soon learned that the astrometry derived from the _ kepler _ images themselves , when combined with high - resolution images of the target neighborhood , could provide a very powerful tool for identifying background eclipsing binaries blended with and contaminating the target images @xcite .",
    "the astrometry of kepler-7  indicated a very slight image centroid shift during transits of + 0.1 millipixels in its ccd row direction only .",
    "the only star listed in the kic that is closer than @xmath16 to kepler-7  and that can contribute significant light to the kepler-7photometry is kic  5780899 , which is 4.4 mag fainter and lies at a separation of @xmath17 .",
    "kic  5780899 can not be the source of the observed dips , because that would induce centroid shifts of about 25 millipixels . if kic  5780899 is constant and kepler-7  is the source of the transits , the predicted shifts are in the right direction and have an amplitude of roughly 0.1 millipixels if a quarter of kic  5780899 s light leaks into the kepler-7  aperture .",
    "thus kic  5780899 provides a satisfactory explanation for the observed shifts .    to check for very close companions , a speckle observation of kepler-7was obtained by s.  howell with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope on kitt peak .",
    "it showed no companions in a @xmath18 box centered on kepler-7 .",
    "subsequently , images obtained by h.  isaacson with the hires guider on keck 1 , and independently by g.  mandushev with the 1.8-m perkins telescope and prism camera at the lowell observatory and by n.  baliber with the lcogt faulkes telescope north on haleakala , maui , all detected a companion at a separation of @xmath19 ( just outside the wiyn speckle window ) and about 4.4 mag fainter in the red .",
    "this companion can not be the source of the observed centroid shifts .",
    "if it is the source of the dips in the light curve , the centroid shifts would have to be larger than 1 millipixel , and in the wrong direction . if it is constant",
    ", the shifts would be much too small to detect .",
    "however , this companion does dilute the photometry of kepler-7  with a contribution of about 2.1% . adding in a quarter of the light from the more distant companion gives a total dilution of about @xmath20 .",
    "this dilution has been included in the analysis of the light curve .",
    "reconnaissance spectra obtained by m.  endl and w.  cochran with the coud echelle spectrograph on the 2.7-m harlan j.  smith telescope at the mcdonald observatory showed that there was no significant velocity variation at the level of 1 @xmath21 , and therefore that an orbiting stellar companion could not be responsible for the observed transits .",
    "furthermore , there was no sign of a composite spectrum or contamination by the spectrum of an eclipsing binary .",
    "the mcdonald spectra were classified by l.  buchhave by finding the best match between the observed spectra and a library of synthetic spectra calculated by j.  laird for an extensive grid of stellar models @xcite using a line list developed by j.  morse .",
    "this yielded @xmath22k , @xmath23(cgs ) , and @xmath24 , very close to the final values reported in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the fibre - fed echelle spectrograph ( fies ) on the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at la palma , was not originally designed with very precise radial velocities in mind . in particular , the fiber feed does not incorporate a scrambler , there is no attempt to control the atmospheric pressure ( e.g. by housing the optics in a vacuum enclosure ) , and there is no correction of the images for atmospheric dispersion .",
    "however , the spectrograph does reside in its own well - insulated room with active control of the temperature to a few hundreths k , with the result that the optics are quite stable .",
    "furthermore , fies has good throughput , partly because the seeing is often excellent at the not site , and an automatic guider keeps the image well centered on a fiber @xmath25 in diameter .",
    "these advantages encouraged us to develop specialized observing procedures and a new data reduction pipeline with the goal of measuring radial velocities to better than @xmath26 for the relatively faint planet candidates identified by _",
    "kepler_.    to establish a wavelength calibration that tracks slow drifts during a long exposure , we adopted the strategy of obtaining strong exposures of a thorium - argon hollow cathode lamp through the science fiber immediately before and after each science exposure .",
    "long science exposures are divided into three or more sub - exposures , to allow detection of and correction for radiation events .",
    "contamination by scattered moonlight can be a serious problem for very precise velocities of faint targets .",
    "fies does not yet have a separate fiber for monitoring the sky brightness , so care is needed to avoid the moon , especially if there are thin clouds .",
    "a new reduction and analysis pipeline optimized for measuring precise radial velocities was developed by l.  buchhave .",
    "after extraction of intensity- and wavelength - calibrated spectra , relative velocities are derived for each echelle order by cross correlation against a combined template created by shifting all the observed spectra of the same star to a common velocity scale and co - adding them .",
    "the final velocity for each observation is the mean of the results for the individual orders , weighted by the number of detected photons but not by the velocity information content .",
    "orders with very low signal levels and orders contaminated by telluric lines are not used .",
    "the internal error of the mean is estimated from the scatter over the orders .",
    "we observed kepler-7  with fies for an hour on each of ten consecutive nights in october 2009 . on every night we observed a standard star , hd  182488 , soon before kepler-7 and also soon after on half the nights",
    "hd  182488 is conveniently located close to the _ kepler _ field of view and is known from hires observations over several years to be stable to better than @xmath27 , and thus was adopted as the primary velocity standard by the follow - up team .",
    "our 15 velocities for hd  182488 show an rms of @xmath28 , with a slow drift pattern with an amplitude of several @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we interpolated a correction to our velocity zero point for each observation of kepler-7  by assuming that hd  182488 should not vary .",
    "one of the 10 observations was obtained through clouds and clearly showed a distortion of the correlation peak due to contamination by scattered moonlight for several of the blue orders .",
    "this observation was rejected .",
    "the results for the other 9 observations are reported in table  [ tab : rvs ] , including the variations in the line bisectors and errors .",
    "we fit a circular orbit to the 9 velocities reported in table  [ tab : rvs ] , adopting the photometric ephemeris , which leaves the orbital semi - amplitude , @xmath30 , and center - of - mass velocity , @xmath31 , as the only free parameters .",
    "a plot of this orbital solution is shown in figure  [ fig : orbit ] , together with the velocity residuals and the line bisector variations .",
    "there is no evidence of a correlation between the velocities and the bisectors , which supports the interpretation that the velocity variations are due to a planetary companion .",
    "the orbital parameters are listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] . allowing the eccentricity to be a free parameter reduced the velocity residuals by only a small amount and yielded an eccentricity that was not significantly different from circular . a solution for a circular orbit using the velocities",
    "uncorrected for the drifts exhibited by the standard star gave similar velocity residuals , but a smaller value of @xmath30 by @xmath32 , corresponding to an 18% smaller mass .",
    "the combined template spectrum for kepler-7  from fies was analyzed by a.  sozzetti using moog , to provide the stellar parameters needed to estimate the mass and radius of the host star using stellar evolution tracks .",
    "the critical input parameters to the models are @xmath33  and [ fe / h ] , but the spectroscopic @xmath34  is also of interest for a consistency check .",
    "a spectrum of kepler-7  obtained by h.  isaacson and g.  marcy with hires on keck 1 was analyzed by d.  fischer using sme @xcite , with very similar results : @xmath35 vs.  @xmath36  k , @xmath37}}= { \\ensuremath{+0.11\\pm0.03}}$ ] vs.  @xmath38 , and @xmath39 vs.  @xmath40(cgs ) , for sme and moog , respectively .",
    "for the results reported in table  [ tab : parameters ] , we used the sme values .",
    "the mean absolute velocity of kepler-7 , @xmath41 , was determined from the fies observations by adopting @xmath42 as the velocity for the standard star hd  182488 .",
    "the analysis of the _ kepler _ photometry and the determination of the stellar and planetary parameters for kepler-7  followed exactly the procedures reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results are reported in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "these results were checked and confirmed by independent analyses carried out by c.  burke and g.  torres .",
    "the kepler-7  host star is not much hotter than the sun , @xmath43k .",
    "however , it is more massive and considerably larger than the sun , @xmath44 and @xmath9 , which puts it in a region of the h - r diagram near the end of its main sequence lifetime .",
    "indeed , the yale - yonsei evolutionary tracks have hooks that cross at the position of kepler-7 , and the probability distribution for the stellar mass has two peaks .",
    "the stronger peak is for an evolutionary state not long before hydrogen burning in the core is exhausted with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while the weaker peak corresponds to a state soon after the star starts to evolve rapidly , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the mass for the evolved peak is 12% smaller , and the radius is 4% smaller ( as it must be to yield the same stellar density ) .",
    "the corresponding planetary radius is also 4% smaller , while the planetary mass is 8% smaller ( because of the dependence on the 2/3 power of the system mass ) . as our best guess for the mass and radius of the host star and for the mass , radius , and density of the planet , in table  [ tab : parameters ] we report the mode and errors for the corresponding probability distributions .",
    "this takes into account all the possible evolutionary states for the host star that are consistent with the observations .",
    "the planetary radius is fifty percent larger than that of jupiter , @xmath49 , but the mass is less than half , @xmath50 , which leads to an unusually low density of @xmath51 . among the known planets ,",
    "only wasp-17b appears to have a lower density @xcite , although the actual value for that planet is not yet well determined .",
    "the position of kepler-7b  on the mass / radius diagram is illustrated in figure  [ fig : massradius ] , which plots all of the transiting planets with known parameters as of 5 november 2009 . because of possible systematic errors in the radial velocities measured using fies , the mass of kepler-7b  may be smaller than we report by as much as 20% or even more . however , the systematic error in the mass on the high side is unlikely to be this large , because a larger orbital amplitude is less vulnerable to systematic velocity errors . for the planetary radius ,",
    "it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the planet is strongly inflated , because the relatively long duration of the transit demands a low density and expanded radius for the star .",
    "a robust measure of the transit duration is the time between the moment when the center of the planet crosses the limb of the star during ingress and the corresponding moment during egress .",
    "a general formula for this duration including the effect of orbital eccentricity is given by @xcite , leading to a value of @xmath52 hours for kepler-7 .",
    "we conclude that future observational refinements to the characteristics of kepler-7b  are more likely to decrease the density than increase it , with a significant uncertainty remaining as long as the evolutionary state of the host star is uncertain .",
    "many people have contributed to the success of the _ kepler mission _ , and it is impossible to acknowledge them all by name .",
