    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first we need to determine a class of galois - type extensions that are sufficiently general to accommodate interesting examples and sufficiently specific to derive a number of desired properties .",
    "this leads to the concept of principal extensions .",
    "they play the role of algebraic analogues of principal bundles . to any such extension",
    "one can associate modules much as vector bundles are associated to principal bundles . for finite - dimensional corepresentations these modules",
    "are always finitely generated projective ( see theorem  [ thm.main ] ) , and thus fit the formalism of the chern - connes pairing between k - theory and cyclic cohomology @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , just as the commutative faithfully flat hopf - galois extensions with bijective antipodes coincide with affine group scheme torsors of algebraic geometry , the principal extensions are precisely the much studied faithfully flat hopf - galois extensions with bijective antipodes whenever the defining coaction is an algebra homomorphism ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] and @xcite )",
    ". a very interesting and non - trivial example of a principal extension encoding a noncommutative version of the instanton fibration @xmath0 was recently constructed in @xcite .",
    "the second and main outcome of this work is the construction and an explicit formula for the chern - galois character .",
    "this is a homomorphism of abelian groups that using a principal extension assigns to the isomorphism class of a finite - dimensional corepresentation the homology class of an even cyclic cycle .",
    "this construction is in analogy with the chern - weil formalism for principal bundles and bridges the coalgebra - galois - extension @xcite and k - theoretic formalisms ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the hopf - galois version ) . in particular , with the help of finitely - summable fredholm modules , it allows one to apply the analytic tool of the noncommutative index formula @xcite to compute the @xmath1-invariants of line bundles over generic podle spheres @xcite , which are among prime examples going beyond the hopf - galois framework .",
    "except for the last formula , we work over a general field @xmath2 .",
    "we use the usual notations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . , @xmath5 , ( summation understood ) for the coproduct of a coalgebra @xmath6 , its iterations and a right @xmath6-coaction on @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we denote the counit of @xmath6 by @xmath8 . for an algebra @xmath9 , @xmath10 stands for the space of left @xmath9-linear maps .",
    "similarly , for a coalgebra @xmath6 , we write @xmath11 for the space of right @xmath6-colinear maps .",
    "the concept of a faithfully flat hopf - galois extension with a bijective antipode is a cornerstone of hopf - galois theory .",
    "the following notion of a _ principal extension _ generalizes this key concept in a way that it encompasses interesting examples escaping hopf - galois theory , yet still enjoys a number of crucial properties of the aforementioned class of hopf - galois extensions .",
    "it is an elaboration of the galois - type extension ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  2.3 ) ( see the condition ( 1 ) below ) , which evolved from @xcite , @xcite and other papers .",

    "+ the meaning of the last condition in definition  [ def.principal ] is as follows . let @xmath23 be a left @xmath22-module and a right @xmath6-comodule such that the coaction is @xmath22-linear .",

    "@xmath6-equivariantly projective @xmath22-module _",
    "iff for every @xmath22-linear @xmath6-colinear epimorphism @xmath24 that is split as a @xmath6-comodule map , and for any @xmath22-linear @xmath6-colinear homomorphism @xmath25 , there exists a @xmath22-linear @xmath6-colinear map @xmath26 such that @xmath27 . for the trivial @xmath6 we recover the usual concept of projectivity .",
    "much as for the trivial @xmath6 , one can show that equivariant projectivity is equivalent to the existence of a @xmath22-linear @xmath6-colinear splitting of the multiplication map @xmath28 .",
    "if we take @xmath29 to be the opposite of the convolution algebra of @xmath6 , then such a splitting is the same as a @xmath30-bimodule splitting of @xmath31 .",
    "now one can reverse the argument and prove that the existence of such a @xmath30-bimodule splitting is equivalent to @xmath9-equivariant projectivity defined analogously as @xmath6-equivariant projectivity .",
    "if @xmath9 is a commutative ring and @xmath22 is an algebra over @xmath9 , then we obtain an old concept of relative projectivity @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , a @xmath30-bimodule splitting of @xmath31 can be interpreted as a cuntz - quillen type connection . the unitalized version of such connections",
    "are called strong connections . more precisely , if @xmath15 is a principal @xmath6-extension , a _",

    "the following lemma allows us to conclude that principal extensions always admit strong connections .",
    "+    let @xmath15 be a @xmath6-extension satisfying conditions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) in definition  [ def.principal ]",
    ". then @xmath12 is @xmath6-equivariantly projective as a left @xmath22-module _ if and only if _ there exists a strong connection .",
    "+ the right - to - left part of the assertion is immediate from the discussion preceding the lemma .",
    "it is the proof of the existence of a strong connection ( unital splitting ) that requires some work .",
    "next , note that the conditions ( 2)(3 ) of definition  [ def.principal ] allow us to give a symmetric formulation of a strong connection . to begin with",
    ", one can define a left coaction @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and prove that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , is bijective .",
    "one can also show that @xmath37 , so that the concept of the translation map @xmath38 , @xmath39}\\ot_bc^{[2]}$ ] ( summation suppressed ) , is left - right symmetric .",
    "this leads to : +    let @xmath15 be a principal @xmath6-extension , and let @xmath40 be the canonical surjection .",
    "then the formulae @xmath41}s(c^{[2]}))$ ] , @xmath42 define mutually inverse maps between the space of strong connections and linear maps @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "lemma.strong.inv     + to avoid multiplying terminology , such unital bicolinear liftings of the translation map are also called strong connections . among other consequences of the principality of an extension is its coflatness .",
    "recall first that , for any right @xmath6-comodule @xmath7 with a coaction @xmath48 and a left @xmath6-comodule @xmath49 with a coaction @xmath50 , the _ cotensor product _ is defined as @xmath51 .",
    "a right ( resp .",
    "left ) @xmath6-comodule @xmath52 is said to be _ coflat _ if the functor @xmath53 ( resp .",
    "@xmath54 ) is exact .",
    "next , recall that there is a general concept of an entwining structure @xmath55 , where @xmath9 is an algebra , @xmath6 a coalgebra , and @xmath56 is a linear map satisfying certain axioms ( * ? ? ?",

    "* theorem  2.7 ) .",
    "moreover , with the help of lemma  [ lemma.strong.inv ] , it can be shown that maps @xmath66 and @xmath67 as in lemma  [ prop.jrl ] can be constructed for any principal @xmath6-extension .",
    "combining together the results described in this section , one can prove the following : +    [ thm1 ] let @xmath15 be a principal @xmath6-extension .",

    "we call such modules associated modules , as they play the role of sections of vector bundles associated to principal bundles ( cf .",

    "denote by @xmath88 the grothendieck group of this semi - group .",
