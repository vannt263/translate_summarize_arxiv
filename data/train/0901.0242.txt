    "a _ causal set _ is a countably infinite partially ordered set @xmath1 such that every element is above only finitely many others .",
    "a causal set is exactly a partially order set that has a linear extension with the order - type of @xmath2 , i.e. , a bijection @xmath3 such that we never have @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we call such a linear extension a _ natural extension_.    we are interested in probability measures on the set of natural extensions of a fixed causal set @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically , we are interested in such measures that satisfy a property called _ order - invariance _ : for each @xmath7 , and each @xmath0-element down - set @xmath8 of @xmath6 , conditioned on the event that @xmath9 , each possible linear extension of the restriction @xmath10 of @xmath6 to @xmath8 is equally likely to be the restriction of @xmath11 to @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this work is part of a wider project , initiated in our companion paper  @xcite . in that paper , we consider probability measures where the causal set @xmath6 is also random .",
    "more precisely , we consider processes that generate a causal set one element at a time , at each stage adding a maximal element , with a label drawn from a given set ( which we take to be @xmath13 $ ] ) , and putting it above some down - set in the current poset . such processes are called _ causal set processes _ : formally they are markov processes , whose states are pairs @xmath14})$ ] , where @xmath15 is a string of elements from @xmath13 $ ] , and @xmath16}$ ] is a partial order on the index set @xmath12 $ ] that is a suborder of the natural order on @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "each state corresponds to a partial order @xmath17 on the set @xmath18  given by @xmath19 if and only if @xmath20 } j$ ]  together with a linear extension of @xmath17 .",
    "let us indicate , fairly precisely , how a probability measure on natural extensions fits into the framework described above .",
    "given a fixed causal set @xmath1 , with @xmath21 $ ] , consider a causal set process where the only allowed transitions are to states @xmath14})$ ] , where @xmath22 is a finite down - set in @xmath6 , and @xmath20 } j$ ] if and only if @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , the derived poset @xmath17 is the restriction of @xmath6 to @xmath24 .",
    "effectively , a transition always adds a minimal element @xmath25 of @xmath26 to the end of the string @xmath15 , and augments the poset @xmath16}$ ] according to which elements of @xmath24 are below @xmath25 in @xmath6 .",
    "in such a process , the order @xmath16}$ ] can be derived from the string @xmath15 and the causal set @xmath6 , and so it can be omitted from the notation .",
    "a sample path of the process gives rise to an infinite string @xmath27 of elements of @xmath28 : if it happens that @xmath29 , then this will be a natural extension of  @xmath6 .",
    "we will give full definitions shortly .",
    "one motivation for studying order - invariant measures comes from physics , in the context of a proposal for a mathematical model of space - time ( see  @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "some years ago , the first author  @xcite studied random linear extensions of locally finite posets .",
    "the main theorem of  @xcite , interpreted in the present context , is as follows .",
    "if a causal set @xmath6 has the property that , for some fixed @xmath0 , every element is incomparable with at most @xmath0 others , then there is a unique order - invariant measure on @xmath6 .",
    "the interpretation is spelled out in theorem  [ thm : unique ] of the present paper .",
    "we shall also give examples of causal sets @xmath6 that admit many order - invariant measures , and causal sets that admit none .",
    "the specific case where the causal set is the two - dimensional grid @xmath30 has attracted attention from another direction , as it is connected with the representation theory of the infinite symmetric group , and with harmonic functions on the young lattice ( which is the lattice of down - sets of @xmath31 ) . a good account of this theory appears in kerov  @xcite , where a somewhat more general theory is also developed .",
    "our concerns in this paper are rather different , but the two theories have various points of contact .    the case of order - invariant measures on a fixed causal set @xmath6 can also be viewed as a ( 1-dimensional ) spin system .",
    "there are ( at least ) two ways to do this : either we can treat the elements as particles , with the spin of an element @xmath32 encoding its rank @xmath33 in a natural extension @xmath11 , or we can treat the pairs of incomparable elements as particles , with the spin of a pair determining which is higher in the natural extension . thus some of the general results discussed in , for instance , bovier  @xcite or georgii  @xcite apply .",
    "( indeed , some of the results in  @xcite hold also for general order - invariant measures , as is explained in  @xcite . )",
    "basic definitions and notation connected with causal sets and natural extensions are given in section  [ sec : csne ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "pfcs ] , we give a full specification of the probability spaces we work in , and define the notion of order - invariance .",
    "section  [ sec : two - ex ] is devoted to two simple examples , worked out in some detail to illustrate the concepts .",
    "thereafter , general results are interspersed with a range of examples , revealing the different types of behaviour that can occur .",
    "an order - invariant measure on a causal set @xmath6 is _ extremal _ if it can not be expressed as a convex combination of two other order - invariant measures on @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : extremal ] , we state a consequence of a result from  @xcite , giving different characterisations of extremal order - invariant measures .",
    "our formal definition of order - invariance includes processes that are not natural extensions of @xmath6 , but instead are natural extensions of the restriction @xmath34 of @xmath6 to some infinite down - set in @xmath6 .",
    "an order - invariant measure that does a.s .  give a natural extension of @xmath6",
    "is called _ faithful _ , and we investigate this concept in section  [ sec : fnfp ]    we are particularly interested in the following two questions .",
    "for which causal sets @xmath6 is there an order - invariant measure ? for which causal sets @xmath6 is there a unique order - invariant measure ?    in section  [ sec : existence ] , we show that any causal set @xmath6 with no infinite antichain admits an order - invariant measure . in section",
    "[ sec : uoim ] , we show that , for any causal set @xmath6 where there is a uniform bound @xmath0 on the number of elements incomparable with an element @xmath35 , there is just one order - invariant measure on @xmath6 . as mentioned above ,",
    "this is a simple application of the main result of  @xcite .",
    "these conditions for existence and uniqueness are far from necessary , and in particular it seems that any description of which causal sets admit an order - invariant measure must be significantly more complicated . in section  [ sec : dbt ] , we show that a downward - branching tree @xmath36 admits an order - invariant measure if and only if a certain series of numbers derived from @xmath36 is convergent .    in section  [ sec : grid ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the case of the two - dimensional grid poset studied by kerov  @xcite and others .",
    "one question that we have not answered is the one that originally motivated this research : is there an order - invariant process that gives rise to causal sets resembling discrete approximations to the space - time structure of the universe ?",
    "this and other open problems are discussed in section  [ sec : op ] .",

    "proceeding in this way , we may construct a suitable @xmath128 .",
    "conversely , suppose that there is a stem @xmath8 of @xmath6 such that the set @xmath137 of minimal elements of @xmath116 is infinite .",

    "we can rephrase the condition of order - invariance in several different ways .    for @xmath148 a stem of @xmath6 ,",

    "this is hopefully reminiscent of the _ gibbs measure _ condition from statistical physics : if we take any finite patch of a space , and condition on the configuration outside that patch ( here , that means conditioning on the event that the set @xmath159 of the first @xmath0 elements ",

    "see georgii  @xcite or bovier  @xcite , for a very general treatment of gibbs measures .    to check order - invariance ,",
    "it is enough to verify condition  ( [ eq : o - i ] ) above when @xmath149 is an adjacent transposition , and the two transposed elements are incomparable .",
    "this is an easy consequence of the easy fact that it is possible to step between any two linear extensions of a finite poset by exchanges of adjacent incomparable elements .",
    "a causet process on @xmath6 is _ order - markov _ if the transition probabilities out of a state @xmath160 depend only on the set @xmath161 , and not on the order of the elements .",
    "a causet measure @xmath114 on @xmath6 is order - markov if its associated process is : this means that @xmath162 whenever @xmath105 and @xmath163 are ordered stems of @xmath6 , @xmath149 is a permutation of @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is a minimal element of @xmath166 .    if @xmath114 is an order - invariant measure on @xmath6 , then",
    "it is also order - markov , as the numerators and denominators above are equal .",
    "the converse is far from true : as an extreme example , consider a causet measure @xmath167 on a causal set @xmath6 where the probability of one specified natural extension @xmath27 of @xmath6 is  1 : this measure @xmath167 is trivially order - markov , but not order - invariant unless @xmath69 forms a chain .",
    "however , if we know that a causet measure @xmath114 arises from an order - markov process , then in order to check order - invariance , it is enough to verify that  ( [ eq : o - i ] ) holds when @xmath149 is the permutation exchanging the _ last _ two incomparable elements : if this holds , then the order - markov condition implies that  ( [ eq : o - i ] ) holds whenever @xmath149 is an exchange of any pair of incomparable elements , and we have already remarked that this suffices for order - invariance .",
    "we shall make use of this later .",
    "we next give an easy but useful lemma , telling us what conditions need to be checked to ensure that a given specification of values @xmath168 defines a measure on @xmath169 , for a given causal set  @xmath6 .",
    "[ to - check ] let @xmath1 be a causal set , and let @xmath170 be a function from the set of ordered stems of @xmath6 to @xmath13 $ ] .",

    "we construct a process which , at each step , takes the next element of the chain @xmath599 with probability @xmath606 , and otherwise takes an element from @xmath604 according to the plancherel measure . with positive probability ,",
    "the sequence constructed is actually a natural extension of @xmath31 : conditioning on this event gives an order - invariant measure on @xmath31 .",
    "the order - invariant measure we obtain `` favours the first row @xmath599 '' , as elements of this row are chosen a positive proportion of the time in the process , unlike in the plancherel measure .",
    "it is easy to see that this can be extended , to obtain processes favouring more than one row , and/or favouring the low - numbered columns .",
    "kerov  @xcite shows that the extremal order - invariant measures on @xmath31 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with pairs of sequences @xmath607 , @xmath608 , such that @xmath609 .",
    "( the measure described above is the one corresponding to @xmath610 , with all other @xmath611 and @xmath612 equal to zero . )",
    "we finish by mentioning a number of open problems .",
    "* is there some reasonably simple description of the class of causal sets that admit a ( faithful ) order - invariant measure ?",
    "we see from consideration of the class of downward - branching trees that there can be no _ very _ simple description . however ,",
    "perhaps theorem  [ tree ] may give some indication of the nature of a possible classification of causal sets admitting an order - invariant measure .",
    "in  @xcite , we give a description of the general form of any extremal order - invariant measure on the space @xmath613 . in order to extend this to a classification of extremal order - invariant measures",
    ", it would suffice to be able to describe all extremal order - invariant measures on fixed causal sets .",
    "it is not clear what such a description might look like , but solving problems  * 1 * and  * 2 * would be progress towards this goal .",
    "* one specific problem relates to a partial order obtained by taking a poisson process @xmath557 in @xmath614 , and taking the partial order @xmath38 on @xmath557 induced by the co - ordinate order .",
    "this is a.s.a causal set .",
    "does such a poset ( a.s . ) admit an order - invariant measure ?",
    "if so , it seems that the causal set will ( a.s . )",
    "admit infinitely many order - invariant measures , because an order - invariant measure @xmath114 must have @xmath615 for some finite set @xmath616 of minimal elements @xmath35 , whereas the poisson process itself has no distinguishable `` minimum region '' of finite area .",
    "this is because the lebesgue measure on @xmath614 , and hence the poisson process , are lorentz invariant ( i.e. , invariant under the measure - preserving transformations @xmath617 of @xmath614 ) .",
    "the motivation behind this problem comes from physics .",
    "any process generating a random causal set can be viewed as a potential discrete model for the space - time universe .",
    "rideout and sorkin  @xcite proposed ( essentially ) order - invariance as a desirable feature of such a model .",
    "it would be good to know whether the ( rich ) class of order - invariant processes does include processes that produce outcomes resembling the observed space - time universe , i.e. , at least locally resembling a poisson process in 4-dimensional minkowski space @xmath618 .",
    "if such a process exists , it will have an expression as a mixture of extremal order - invariant processes on fixed causal sets , where the causal sets `` resemble '' those produced from a poisson process .",
    "it seems likely that either ( i )  causal sets arising from a poisson process in @xmath618 ( with an origin ) a.s .",
    "admit an order - invariant measure , or ( ii )  there is some necessary structural condition for the existence of an order - invariant measure that is not satisfied by any causal set `` faithfully embedded '' into @xmath618 .",
    "it would be very interesting to know which .",
    "* can one say anything interesting about the causet properties `` @xmath6 admits an order - invariant measure '' and `` @xmath6 admits a unique order - invariant measure '' .",
    "could one or other be monotone ( i.e. , preserved under adding relations ) ?",
    "the following example shows that the property `` @xmath6 admits a faithful order - invariant measure '' is not monotone .",
    "let @xmath1 consist of two chains @xmath619 and @xmath620 , with also the ` cross - relations ' @xmath621 if @xmath622  so each element @xmath439 has @xmath623 elements of @xmath132 below it .",
    "this causal set @xmath6 is obtained from the one in example  2 , which does admit a faithful order - invariant measure , by adding relations .",
    "we shall show that , in any order - invariant measure @xmath114 on @xmath6 , @xmath624 , and hence all the elements of @xmath293 , are absent .    for @xmath625 ,",
    "let @xmath557 be any down - set of @xmath6 of size @xmath626 containing @xmath624 .",
    "so @xmath627 , and so @xmath557 contains at most @xmath198 elements of @xmath293 . if @xmath628 is the poset with @xmath629 consisting of the union of the two chains @xmath630 and @xmath631 , without the cross - relations , then @xmath632 .",
    "now the theorem of graham , yao and yao  @xcite implies that adding the cross - relations ( which means conditioning on certain events that the @xmath633 are higher than the @xmath391 ) can not increase the probability that @xmath624 is below @xmath336 : thus @xmath634 as in the proof of proposition  [ maximal - absent ] , this implies that , in any order - invariant measure @xmath114 on @xmath6 , @xmath635 for every @xmath198 , so @xmath636 .",
    "finally , by lemma  [ non - zero ] , we see that @xmath624 , and hence all the @xmath439 , are absent in @xmath114 .",
    "the property of admitting an order - invariant measure is preserved under the addition of _ finitely many _ relations to @xmath6 : conditioning an order - invariant measure @xmath114 on the event that a linear extension of @xmath6 respects those extra relations yields an order - invariant measure on the causal set with the relations added .",
