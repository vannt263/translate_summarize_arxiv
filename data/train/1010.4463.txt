    "the cms collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of cern observed last year @xcite significant two - particle angular correlations of charged particles , produced in proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) collisions at a center - of - mass energy @xmath2 .",
    "these correlations are of long - range nature in the pseudorapidity difference @xmath3 and appear on a three - dimensional ( 3-d ) plot of the @xmath4 correlation function as a clearly seen ridge - like structure on the near - side @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the difference in the pseudorapidity @xmath7 $ ] between the two produced particles , where @xmath8 is the polar angle relative to the beam axis , and @xmath9 is the difference in their azimuthal angle .",
    "the ridge becomes most pronounced for intermediate transverse momenta @xmath10 and in events with an average charged - particle multiplicity of at least @xmath11 , whereas simulations using monte carlo ( mc ) models do not predict such an effect  independent of multiplicity and transverse momentum .",
    "no evidence for such near - side long - range correlations has been found in the @xmath0 or @xmath12 data before , though the novel ridge structure is reminiscent of correlations observed in nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite .",
    "however , these correlations were assumed to arise from interactions of the produced particles with the medium and from collective effects in the _ initial - state _ interactions of the nuclei .    adopting the notations of @xcite ,",
    "the two - particle correlation function can be defined as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote single and double particle distributions in the final state , respectively @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will express the correlation function in terms of _ parton _ distributions which differ , in general , from those of real particles ( hadrons ) .",
    "this approximation is justified because the correlations under consideration emerge long before the hadronization starts , so that the process can be adequately described in terms of partons . in the context of the cms experiment",
    ", @xmath16 resembles @xmath17 , i.e. , the signal distribution , whereas the product of the single parton distributions plays the role of the random background distribution @xmath18cf .",
    "( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) in @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 is the number of tracks per event averaged over the multiplicity bin and @xmath20 is determined by averaging over multiplicity bins and over @xmath21 and @xmath22see @xcite .",
    "these quantities will be specified and discussed in detail within our theoretical framework later .",
    "a wide pseudorapidity range of correlated charged - particle pairs indicates that the source of the correlation has to be primordial , in the sense that it emerges coincidentally with the particle production , but before hadronization occurs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical attempts to dig out the physical origin of the ridge structure in the high - multiplicity @xmath0 data observed by cms mainly concentrate on the properties of a particular state of matter  the color glass condensate ( cgc)that was created during the high - energy collision ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "other authors claim that the observed ridge may be the manifestation of an azimuthal quadrupole @xcite , or the result of reflective scattering effects in multiparticle production processes @xcite .",
    "further references concerning the ridge formation mechanisms can be found in @xcite , where the cms collaboration have updated their analysis to include the full 2010 statistics .",
    "we are going to approach the emergence of the ridge phenomenon from another side which has echoes of our previous works on the gauge invariance of transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution functions ( pdf)s ( see @xcite , and @xcite for reviews ) . to be precise",
    ", we intend to discuss effects ensuing from nonlocal path - dependent interactions ",
    "the latter naturally arising in the gauge - invariant description of high - energy processes with charged particles in terms of mandelstam fields @xcite .",
    "we will argue in what follows that the inclusion of semi - infinite gauge links ( wilson lines ) gives rise to a phase that in some sense is akin to the intrinsic coulomb phase found by jakob and stefanis ( js ) @xcite in qed by employing mandelstam s gauge - invariant path - dependent formalism .",
    "the origin of the intrinsic coulomb phase can be considered as a residual effect of the primordial separation of the particle from its oppositely charged counterpart and has no bearing on external charge distributions .",
    "adopting this viewpoint , we will work out a scheme which will enable us to calculate the leading - order contribution to the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) @xmath4 correlation function of interacting wilson lines .",
    "the justification for such a treatment is provided by the fact that wilson lines can be recast in the form of particle worldlines in the context of first - quantized theories @xcite .",
    "therefore , this scheme lends itself to the actual experimental situation in which charged particles are emitted in the @xmath0 collisions at a very high center of mass energy @xmath23 of 0.9 , 2.36 , and 7 tev , forming highly collimated jets before they finally hadronize . the key idea here",
    "is that as the number of such particle tracks increases , several pairs of them are created in unison ( with regard to their separation in @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , so that the quantum mechanism of entanglement applies .",
    "note in this context that it is not necessary to consider these pairs as being formed by particles with opposite polarities , as discussed by js in the special case of the qed intrinsic coulomb phase .",
    "in fact , the cms data analysis @xcite has shown that the results for like - sign and unlike - sign pairs agree with each other within uncertainties .",
    "also our calculation does not depend on the sign of the correlated pairs . as we will see below , the obtained result shows a clear and significant ridge - like structure in the plane of the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle between the interacting wilson lines , which occurs around @xmath26 and extends over a wide range of @xmath24 , albeit the near - side peak is less prominent compared to that observed by cms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we recall the main features of the intrinsic coulomb phase in qed in order to sketch the main idea underlying the present application .",
    "our theoretical approach to understand the ridge structure and the comparison with the experimental findings of the cms collaboration are presented in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] , we give a summary of our results and discuss them further . finally , in sec .  [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "it is worth indulging in a quick detour into the nature of the `` intrinsic '' coulomb phase @xcite which is an extreme case of quantum entanglement because it persists even for infinitely separated particles .    within the js path - dependent approach , charged fields",
    "are always accompanied by a soft - photon cloud in terms of a non - integrable phase factor which contains a timelike straight line stretching to infinity . in the presence of other charges , the charged field acquires a relativistic coulomb phase , in accordance with the results obtained earlier by kulish and faddeev @xcite , and independently by zwanziger @xcite .",
    "but , it also yields an additional phase that does not depend on external charge distributions and remains different from zero , even if the conventional coulomb phase vanishes  hence , the name `` intrinsic '' .",
    "the origin of this phase was ascribed by js to the asymptotic interaction of the charged particle with its oppositely charged counterpart that was removed `` behind the moon '' instantaneously after their common primordial creation .",
    "the mechanism of the particle creation , as well as that of their separation , is irrelevant for these considerations .",
    "what counts is that they have been created in common , i.e. , entangled . speaking in more technical terms , the intrinsic coulomb phase is acquired during the parallel transport of the charged field along a timelike straight line from infinity to the point of interaction with the photon field and is absent in the local approach , i.e. , for charged fields joined by a ( gauge ) connector ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it is different from zero only for a mandelstam field , which has its own gauge contour attached to it , and keeps track of its full history since its primordial entangled creation with its antiparticle .",
    "let us also mention that the existence of a balancing charge `` behind the moon '' was postulated before by several authors ",
    "see @xcite for related references  in an attempt to restore the lorentz covariance of the charged sector of qed .",
    "therefore , the discussed mechanism of phase entanglement originates from quite general features of gauge field theory and is insensitive to the specific properties of the particular process under consideration .",
    "we want to make it clear at this point that we are not advocating a violation of the principle of locality : nothing can cross a void linking cause to effect  except a phase .    the simplest non - abelian generalization of the intrinsic coulomb phase for the quark fields reads ( in leading order of the strong coupling constant @xmath27 indicated by the superscript @xmath28 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ( free ) gluon propagator , and the current @xmath31 describes the residual effects of the oppositely charged counterpart in a semiclassical approximation . the integration path @xmath32 is the contour defined by the kinematics of the process and can have a complicated structure venturing off - the - light - cone in the transverse direction @xcite .",
    "note that the phase ( [ eq : phase ] ) can be considered as the leading non - trivial term of the expansion of a non - abelian path - ordered exponential @xcite in the ground state ( abbreviated by gs ) , i.e. ,    @xmath33 =    \\left\\langle { \\rm gs }    \\left| { \\cal p }    \\exp\\big[ig \\int_{\\gamma}\\ ! d\\zeta^\\mu             \\",

    ". \\label{eq : phase-2}\\ ] ]    as we shall show shortly , the path dependence of the phase factor in ( [ eq : phase-2 ] ) becomes crucial in the application of the mandelstam formalism in studying semi - inclusive processes in qcd .",
    "the appearance of long - range correlations in nuclear collisions at rhic @xcite and ( very recently ) in @xmath0-collisions at the lhc @xcite has been studied within the color - glass - condensate approach in @xcite ( see also the more recent papers @xcite ) . in our study",
    "we refrain from making any assumptions about the structure of the quark - gluon ( qg ) matter just - before / during / just - after the proton - proton collisions , and appeal instead to a field theoretic description of the particle tracks in terms of path - dependent exponentials along the lines exposed above .",
    "nevertheless , the properties of the qg - matter can be taken into account within our approach by means of a specification of the ground state entering the evaluation of matrix elements with wilson - line exponentials .    to make qualitative estimates",
    ", we will now expose our working method to treat the semi - inclusive process of the two - particle production in the proton - proton collision in more mathematical terms and start by writing @xmath34 in what follows , we try to understand this process from the point of view of the qcd factorized cross - section , our goal being to figure out what part(s ) of this factorized expression is ( are ) responsible for the above - mentioned ridge - like structure .",
    "keep in mind that the observed correlations have to be nonlocal and primordial so that our task consists in identifying which part in the factorized expression can serve as the root cause of such a phenomenon .",
    "the ( symbolic ) factorization formula reads @xmath35 while a detailed discussion of this expression and references can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "problems related to the factorization and universality of tmd pdfs , etc . , are considered in refs .",
    "note that these issues are not crucial for our discussion .",
    "we will demonstrate below that the correlations under consideration can be described by the interaction of wilson lines without explicit reference to the factorization formula .",
    "the acronyms used in the above equation and below have the following meaning : pff  parton fragmentation function ; df  distribution function ; ff  fragmentation function , so that the subscripts @xmath36 are labels for ` distribution ' and ` fragmentation ' , respectively .",
    "note that the right place to take into account tmd pdfs is the moderate @xmath37 region @xmath38 , where the intrinsic transverse momenta of the partons become relevant , while at larger @xmath37 the transverse momentum is mostly generated by perturbative hard - gluon exchanges .",
    "given these circumstances , one has to dig out the origin of the long - range primordial correlations employing the above factorization theorem .",
    "we will argue that the observed two - particle correlation has its origin in the soft factors which are indispensable for the renormalization of the tmd pdfs @xcite .",
    "each df ( or ff ) has its own soft part , so that the above factorization becomes @xmath39 \\otimes         [ { \\cal f}_{\\rm d_2 }         \\cdot s_{\\rm d_2 } ] \\otimes         [ { \\cal f}_{\\rm f_1 }         \\cdot s_{\\rm f_1 } ] \\otimes         [ { \\cal f}_{\\rm f_1 }         \\cdot s_{\\rm f_2 } ]         + { \\rm power \\ suppressed \\ terms } \\ .",

    "( [ eq : factorization_soft ] ) .",
    "these soft factors serve to eliminate overlapping divergences originating from interrelated short and large - scale effects that can not be cured by ( dimensional ) regularization when calculating correlators of contour - dependent quark and gluon operators .",
    "it can be linked to a cusp in the gauge contour at light - cone infinity and gives rise to a non - integrable phase factor @xcite .    to implement our considerations ,",
    "we define the following correlation function in terms of the soft factors of the fragmentation functions ( the latter describing the hadronization process ) , considering it as a simplified version of the true correlation function given by ( [ eq : corr_fun ] ) : @xmath42 taking into account that the soft factors enter the definition of tmd fragmentation functions multiplicatively , we assume that the soft correlation function ( [ eq : corr_soft ] ) can be used as a ( separately calculable ) correction to the full correlation function @xmath43 that also includes the non - soft contributions from the tmd pffs .",
    "our task is , therefore , to demonstrate that the soft function ( [ eq : corr_soft ] ) gives rise to the long - range rapidity contributions that can not be obtained without soft factors .",

    "[ fig : wilson ] .",
    "hence , the two - particle correlation function of experimental tracks transforms in our scheme into the correlation function of the worldlines of auxiliary particles moving along the gauge contours entering the soft factors and can be parameterized in terms of their separation in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle .",
    "pictorially , this theoretical setup of wilson ( or world- ) lines looks like a sheaf of wheat within a small conus of less than about @xmath49 degrees corresponding to a @xmath24 of 2.44 .",

    "in conclusion , using a theoretical framework which emulates particle tracks produced in high - energy @xmath0-collisions at the lhc by interacting wilson lines , we discussed the possibility of quantum entanglement for pairs of charged particles .",
    "this soft correlation is universal and leads to 2-d and 1-d two - particle angular correlation functions which reproduce the characteristic ridge structure observed in the cms experiment  though in less pronounced form .",
    "hadronic properties may be taken into account in a refined analysis to improve the agreement with the data more quantitatively .",
    "thanks the organizers of the conference ismd 2010 ( antwerp ) for the invitation and support , where he first learned about the cms result .",
    "he also thanks x. janssen and the participants of his seminars in antwerp and lige for useful discussions .",
