    "we measured an identical value of @xmath59  but with larger error bars possibly because of a slight parameter mismatch between the two stars .",

    "figure  [ fig-4 ] shows a set of constraints placed on the free parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the mass function defines a narrow constraint for a given subdwarf mass : the minimum secondary mass ranges from 0.75 to 0.77 @xmath3 for a subdwarf mass ranging from 0.44 to 0.48 @xmath3 . combining mass function and tidal constraints at @xmath55 , the secondary mass ranges from 0.77 to 0.87 @xmath3 implying a total mass of @xmath66 . the effective temperature and surface gravity of cd@xmath030  11223 place it squarely amongst the bulk of sdb stars that are best described with the models of @xcite within a narrow mass range centered on @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , tests showed that constraints placed by ellipsoidal variations and by the mass function are incompatible below @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , assuming a mass close to 0.48@xmath3 is probably justified and the possibility that past interactions may have left an extremely low mass remnant ( @xmath69 , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not need to be considered .",
    "uncertainties on the rotation velocity measurements are possibly affected by systematic effects such as over- or under - estimated spectral resolution or orbital smearing .",
    "assuming a rotation velocity as low as 150  would increase the upper mass limit to 1.05 @xmath3 and push the inclination as low as 57@xmath70 .",
    "the possibility of shallow ( @xmath71 mmag ) secondary transits can not be ruled out and transit timing would allow us to constrain accurately the inclination and stellar radii .",

    "first , @xmath48 is obtained from the measured mass function @xmath76 assuming @xmath77 ( thick full line ) .",
    "the range of primary mass is dictated by evolutionary considerations , such as the evolutionary tracks of @xcite that generates remnants of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "next , a relation between @xmath48 and the inclination is derived from the measured amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations assuming @xmath78 ( thin lines from bottom to top @xmath790.086 , 0.094 , 0.102 magnitude and shaded area ) .",
    "the diagram is split between areas with detectable and non - detectable transits . ]",
    "we found that the hot subdwarf cd@xmath030  11223 is in a close 70.5 minutes binary with an unseen companion presumed to be a white dwarf . the orbital properties and noted photometric variations suggest the presence of a companion with a minimum mass of @xmath80 assuming a minimum mass of @xmath81 for the primary .",
    "however , the measured parameters of the sdb cd@xmath030  11223 favor a canonical mass close to 0.48 @xmath3 that would correspond to a minimum mass of 0.77 @xmath3 for the secondary . constraining the radius of the primary using a measurement of its rotation velocity and fitting the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations set an upper limit of 0.87 @xmath3 for the secondary mass at an inclination @xmath82 and a total mass of 1.35 @xmath3 for the system .",
    "however , systematic effects in the measurement of the rotation velocity and the possibility that the primary mass may exceed 0.48 @xmath3 imply that the system mass may exceed the chandrasekhar mass limit ( @xmath83 ) . observations of transits would help constrain the inclination of the system and the primary radius .    following @xcite",

    "it is likely that a substantial amount of helium may remain in the envelope of the ehb star that would then constitute a generous helium donor .",
    "following @xcite , the outcome depends on the mass of the accreting white dwarf and the amount of helium available from the donor .",
    "the minimum mass of the white dwarf ( @xmath85 ) exceeds a threshold ( @xmath86 ) below which the system would undergo nova - like , helium - flash episodes . instead",
    ", should enough helium ( @xmath87 ) accumulate on the massive white dwarf after the onset of stable mass transfer the system may suffer helium detonation that could light - up the c / o core triggering a type ia supernova . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that the ehb star could exhaust most of its helium supply before contact and merge with its massive white dwarf companion .",
    "should the total mass of the system exceed @xmath83 the remnant could also trigger a type ia supernova . alternatively , should the system mass prove insufficient , the immediate outcome would be a hot , ultramassive white dwarf such as those sampled by @xcite in the extreme ultraviolet explorer survey .",
