    "the properties of basic electrical circuits , constructed from three ideal elements , a resistor , a capacitor , an inductor , and an ideal voltage source @xmath7 , are a standard staple of physics and engineering courses .",

    "@xcite this ground - breaking hypothesis meant that the trio of ideal circuit elements ( r , c , l ) were not sufficient to model a basic real - world circuit ( that may have a memristive component as well ) . in 1976 , leon chua and sung kang extended the analysis further to memristive systems .",
    "@xcite these seminal articles studied the properties of a memristor , the fourth ideal circuit element , and showed that diverse systems such as thermistors , josephson junctions , and ionic transport in neurons , described by the hodgkins - huxley model , are special cases of memristive systems .  @xcite    despite the simplicity and the soundness of the symmetry argument that predicts the existence of the fourth ideal element , experimental realization of a quasi - ideal memristor - defined by the single - valued relationship @xmath24 - remained elusive .",

    "the oxygen vacancies in the second layer behave as charge + 2 mobile dopants .",
    "these dopants create a doped tio@xmath27 region , whose resistance is significantly lower than the resistance of the undoped region .",
    "the boundary between the doped and undoped regions , and therefore the effective resistance of the thin film , depends on the position of these dopants .",
    "it , in turn , is determined by their mobility @xmath29 ( @xmath30 @xmath31/v.s )  @xcite and the electric field across the doped region .",

    "the effective resistance of such a device is @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath381k@xmath39 )  @xcite is the resistance of the memristor if it is completely doped , and @xmath40 is its resistance if it is undoped .",

    "therefore , it follows from eq.([eq : current ] ) that the current @xmath74 will be a multi - valued function of the voltage @xmath21 .",
    "it also follows that since @xmath75 , the memristive behavior is dominant only at low frequencies @xmath76 . here @xmath77 is the time that the dopants need to travel distance @xmath32 under a constant voltage @xmath78 . @xmath79 and @xmath80 provide the natural time and frequency scales for a memristive circuit ( typical parameters  @xcite imply @xmath81 ms and @xmath82 khz ) .",

    "the size of this loop varies inversely with the frequency @xmath91 . at high frequencies , @xmath88 ,",
    "the size of the doped region barely changes before the applied voltage begins the return sweep .",

    "[ fig : hyste ] shows the theoretical _",
    "q_-@xmath2 curve for @xmath86 that follows from eq.([eq : charge ] ) .",
    "thus , a single memristor shows a wide variety of _ i - v _ characteristics based on the frequency of the applied voltage . since the mobility of the ( oxygen vacancy",
    ") dopants is low , memristive effects are appreciable only when the memristor size is nano - scale .",
    "now , we consider an ideal circuit with two memristors in series ( fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "it follows from kirchoff s laws that if two memristors @xmath92 and @xmath93 have the same polarity , @xmath94 , they add like regular resistors , @xmath95 whereas when they have opposite polarities , @xmath96 , the @xmath1-dependent component is suppressed , @xmath97 .",
    "the fact that memristors with same polarities add in series leads to the possibility of a superlattice of memristors with micron dimensions instead of the nanoscale dimensions .",
    "we emphasize that a single memristor can not be scaled up without losing the memristive effect because the relative change in the size of the doped region decreases with scaling .",
    "a superlattice of nano - scale memristors , on the other hand , will show the same memristive effect when scaled up .",
    "we leave the problem of two memristors in parallel to the reader .",
    "these non - trivial properties of an ideal memristor circuit raise the following question : what are the properties of basic circuits with a memristor and a capacitor or an inductor ? (",
    "a memristor - resistor circuit is trivial . )",
    "we will explore this question in the subsequent sections .",
    "let us consider an ideal mc circuit with a capacitor having an initial charge @xmath98 and no voltage source .",
    "the effective resistance of the memristor is determined by its polarity ( whether the doped region increases or decreases ) , and since the charge decay time - constant of the mc circuit depends on its effective resistance , the capacitor discharge will depend on the memristor polarity .",
    "kirchoff s voltage law applied to an ideal mc circuit gives @xmath99 where @xmath14 is the charge on the capacitor .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath1-dependence of the memristance here is @xmath100 because if @xmath1 is the remaining charge on the capacitor , then the charge that has passed through the memristor is ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "eq.([eq : mcdischarge ] ) is integrated by rewriting it as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain the following implicit equation @xmath105=q_0\\exp \\left[-\\frac{t}{{{\\cal r}_f}c}\\right]\\exp\\left[\\frac{\\eta\\delta{\\cal r}q_0 } { { { \\cal r}_f}q_0}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the memristance when the entire charge @xmath98 has passed through the memristor .",
    "@xcite a small @xmath25-expansion of eq.([eq : implicitq ] ) shows that the initial current @xmath107 is independent of the memristor polarity @xmath108 , and the large-@xmath25 expansion shows that the charge on the capacitor decays exponentially , @xmath109 . in the intermediate region , the naive expectation @xmath110 $ ] is not the self - consistent solution of eq.([eq : implicitq ] ) .",
    "therefore , although a memristor can be thought of as an effective resistor , its effect in an mc circuit is not captured by merely substituting its time - dependent value in place of the resistance in an ideal rc circuit . qualitatively , since the memristance decreases or increases depending on its polarity , we expect that when @xmath49 the mc circuit will discharge faster than an rc circuit with same resistance @xmath89 . that rc circuit , in turn , will discharge faster than the same mc circuit when @xmath85",
    ". figure  [ fig : mc ] shows the theoretical _ q - t _ curves obtained by ( numerically ) integrating eq.([eq : mcdischarge ] ) .",
    "these results indeed fulfill our expectations .",
    "we note that eq.([eq : implicitq ] ) , obtained using the linear - drift model , is valid for @xmath111 when @xmath49 which guarantees that the final memristance @xmath112 is always positive .",

    "[ fig : mc ] shows the time - evolution of the size of the doped region @xmath44 obtained using eq.([eq : w ] ) and confirms the applicability of the linear - drift model .",
    "we remind the reader that changing the polarity of the memristor can be accomplished by exchanging the @xmath50 plates of the fully charged capacitor .",
    "it is now straightforward to understand an ideal mc circuit with a direct - current ( dc ) voltage source @xmath78 and an uncharged capacitor .",
    "this problem is the time - reversed version of an mc circuit with the capacitor charge @xmath113 and no voltage source .",
    "the only salient difference is that in the present case , the charge passing through the memristor is the same as the charge on the capacitor . using kirchoff s voltage law",
    "we obtain the following implicit result , @xmath114\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the memristance when @xmath116 .",
    "as before , eq.([eq : implicitq2 ] ) shows that when @xmath117 , the ideal mc circuit charges faster ( slower ) than an ideal rc circuit with the same resistance @xmath89 . in particular , the capacitor charging time for @xmath49 ( the doped region widens and the memristance reduces with time ) decreases steeply as the dc voltage @xmath118 , the maximum voltage at which the linear - drift model is applicable .",
    "@xcite    now we turn our attention to an ml circuit .",

    "curves for an ml circuit obtained from eq.([eq : currentl ] ) ; these results are consistent with our qualitative analysis .",
    "note that the net charge passing through the memristor in an ml circuit is @xmath136 .",
    "therefore an upper limit on initial current @xmath122 for the validity of the linear - drift model  @xcite is given by @xmath137 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "as in the case of an ideal mc circuit charge , the ml circuit current decays steeply as @xmath122 approaches this upper limit .    figs .",
    "[ fig : mc ] and  [ fig : ml ] suggest that ideal mc and ml circuits have a one - to - one correspondence analogous to the ideal rc and rl circuits .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to think that solution of an ideal ml circuit with a dc voltage @xmath78 is straightforward .",

    "the relevant differential equation obtained using kirchoff s voltage law , @xmath140 shows that it is not the case . in an ml circuit ,",
    "as the current @xmath16 asymptotically approaches its maximum value , it can pump an arbitrarily large charge @xmath141 through the memristor .",
    "hence , for any non - zero voltage , no matter how small , the linear - drift model breaks down at large times when @xmath142 exceeds @xmath32 ( @xmath49 ) or becomes negative ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this failure of the linear - drift model reflects the fact that when the ( oxygen vacancy ) dopants approach either end of the memristor , their drift is strongly suppressed by a non - uniform electric field .",
    "thus , unlike the ideal rl circuit , the steady - state current in an ideal ml circuit is not solely determined by the resistance @xmath89 but also by the inductor . in the following section , we present more realistic models of the dopant drift that take into account its suppression near the memristor boundaries",
    "the linear - drift model used in preceding sections captures the majority of salient features of a memristor .",
    "it makes the ideal memristor , mc , and ml circuits analytically tractable and leads to closed - form results such as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) , ( [ eq : implicitq ] ) , and ( [ eq : currentl ] ) . we leave it as an exercise for the reader to verify that these results reduce to their well - known r , rc , and rl counterparts in the limit when the memristive effects are negligible , @xmath143 .",
    "the linear drift model suffers from one serious drawback : it does not take into account the boundary effects .",

    "we find that irrespective of the memristor polarity , the memristive effects are manifest only in the transient region .",
    "we leave it as an exercise for the reader to explore the strong transient response for @xmath197 and compare it with the steady state response at resonance @xmath198 .",
    "in this tutorial , we have presented theoretical properties of the fourth ideal circuit element , the memristor , and of basic circuits that include a memristor . in keeping with the revered tradition in physics , the existence of an ideal memristor",
    "was predicted in 1971  @xcite based purely on symmetry argument  @xcite ; however , its experimental discovery  @xcite and the accompanying elegant physical picture  @xcite took another 37 years .",
    "the circuits we discussed complement the standard rc , rl , lc , rcl circuits , thus covering all possible circuits that can be formed using the four ideal elements ( a memristor , a resistor , a capacitor , and an inductor ) and a voltage source .",
    "we have shown in this tutorial that many phenomena - the change in the discharge rate of a capacitor when the @xmath50 plates are switched or change in the current in a circuit when the battery terminals are swapped - are attributable to a memristive component in the circuit .",
    "@xcite in such cases , a real - world circuit can only be mapped on to one of the ideal circuits with memristors .",
    "the primary property of the memristor is the _ memory of the charge that has passed through it _ , reflected in its effective resistance @xmath58 .",
    "although the microscopic mechanisms for this memory can be different ,  @xcite dimensional analysis implies that the memristor size @xmath32 and mobility @xmath29 provide a unit of magnetic flux @xmath199 that characterizes the memristor .",
    "although the underlying idea behind a memristor is straightforward , its nano - scale size remains the main challenge in creating and experimentally investigating basic electrical circuits discussed in this article .",
    "we conclude this tutorial by mentioning an alternate possibility .",
    "it is well - known that an rcl circuit is equivalent  @xcite to a 1-dimensional mass+spring system in which the position @xmath200 of the point mass is equivalent to the charge @xmath14 , the mass is @xmath5 , the spring constant is @xmath201 , and the viscous drag force is given by @xmath202 where @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , a memristor is equivalent to a viscous force with a @xmath204-dependent drag coefficient , @xmath205 .",
    "choosing @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the typical stretch of the spring , will create the equivalent of an mcl circuit.since a viscous force naturally occurs in fluids , a vertical mass+spring system in which the mass moves inside a fluid with a large vertical viscosity gradient can provide a macroscopic realization of the mcl circuit .    it is a pleasure to thank r. decca , a. gavrin , g. novak , and k. vasavada for helpful discussions and comments .",
