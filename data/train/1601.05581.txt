    "there is a renewed interest in the study of wave propagation , in particular because of recent applications to ultrasound imaging ( i.e. hifu ) or technical and medical applications such as lithotripsy or thermotherapy .",
    "such new techniques rely heavily on the ability to model accurately the nonlinear propagation of a finite - amplitude sound pulse in thermo - viscous elastic media .",
    "we analyse the derivation of different models of non - linear acoustics such as the kuznetzov  @xcite , the nonlinear progressive wave equation ( npe )  @xcite and the khokhlov - zabolotskaya - kuznetzov ( kzk )  @xcite equations which are perturbative and paraxial approximations of small perturbations around a given state of a compressible nonlinear isentropic navier - stokes ( for viscous media ) and euler ( for the non - viscous case ) systems .",
    "the direct derivation shows that the kuznetzov equation is the first order approximation of the navier - stokes system , the kzk and npe equations are the first order approximations of the kuznetzov equation and the second order approximations of the navier - stokes system . in addition , the npe equation can be considered as an approximation of the kzk equation .    to be able to validate the approximation of the exact solution of the navier - stokes / euler systems by the solution of the kuznetsov / kzk / npe equation",
    ", we need to ensure that the derivation of our model , the kuznetsov / kzk / npe equation , allows us to reconstruct the solution of the initial navier - stokes system from the solution of the kuznetsov / kzk / npe equation . in this aim , following the ideas of refs .",

    "we introduce constant states @xmath16 next , we assume that the density fluctuations ( around the constant state @xmath17 ) and the velocity fluctuations ( around @xmath18 , which can be taken equal to zero using a galilean transformation ) , are of the same order of @xmath0 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a dimensionless parameter which characterizes the smallness of the perturbation .",
    "for instance , in water with an initial power of the order of @xmath21 @xmath0 is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "we also suppose that all viscosity coefficients , for instance , @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , are small of the order @xmath0 : @xmath25 using the transport heat equation up to the terms of the order of @xmath26 @xmath27 the approximate state equation @xmath28 ( where the notation @xmath29 means that the expression in brackets is constant in @xmath6 ) , can be replaced  @xcite by @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the ratio of the heat capacities at constant pressure and at constant volume respectively .",

    "a way to obtain an approximate equation containning all terms of the same order without modification of the order of remainder terms is to perform a paraxial approximation , which we introduce in the next section .",
    "this time the approximation becomes the second order approximation and will be given by the kzk equation .",
