    "several texts provide an elementary derivation of the kinematics of special relativity , eventually based on the first part of einstein s fundamental paper of 1905 .",
    "@xcite starting from the two postulates of the total equivalence of inertial reference systems , and of the constancy of the speed of light in all such systems , it is in fact easy to obtain the expression of the lorentz transformation of space - time coordinates .",
    "a particularly simple and appealing derivation is obtained by exploiting bondi s so - called @xmath0-calculus ,  @xcite itself based on the doppler effect .",
    "nevertheless going from kinematics ( the lorentz transformation ) to dynamics , and in particular to the relativistic expressions of momentum and energy , is often achieved by resorting to more sophisticated concepts , like that of a four - vector , or by the use of quantum considerations .",
    "( one example of this approach is the `` elementary derivation '' suggested by f.  rohrlich ,  @xcite which exploits the expressions of the momentum and energy of a photon of frequency  @xmath1 . )",
    "einstein himself had originally derived the mass - energy equivalence via an explicit use of electrodynamics ,  @xcite and not just by the kind of kinematic considerations which he had developed in the first part of his 1905 paper , which are based on the constancy of the speed of light , but do not otherwise depend on maxwell s equations .",
    "einstein had remarked this problem , and he proposed in 1935 an elementary derivation of the mass - energy relation , independent of his 1905 argument , motivating it with the following words :  @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the special theory of relativity grew out of the maxwell electromagnetic equations .",
    "so it came about that even in the derivation of the mechanical concepts and their relations the consideration of those of the electromagnetic field has played an essential role .",
    "the question as to the independence of those relations is a natural one because the lorentz transformation , the real basis of the special relativity theory , in itself has nothing to do with the maxwell theory and because we do not know the extent to which the energy concepts of the maxwell theory can be maintained in the face of the data of molecular physics . in the following considerations , except for the lorentz transformation , we will depend only on the assumption of the conservation principles for impulse and energy .",

    "tolman  @xcite and further discussed by p.s .",
    "epstein ,  @xcite where one considers collisions between pairs of particles in different inertial reference frames , and one looks for the expressions of momentum and energy by postulating their conservation .",
    "it is interesting to point out that lewis and tolman s paper , as well as epstein s one , only consider elastic collision and derive the relativistic expression of momentum , while they provide a doubtful argument for the mass - energy equivalence by the consideration of the change of the `` relativistic mass '' with speed .",
    "`` relativistic mass '' is in fact a rather problematic concept,@xcite and there is a growing consensus to avoid its introduction in the teaching of relativity .",
    "einstein derives instead the equivalence by simply extending the argument to inelastic collisions .",
    "the advantage of this approach for introducing the basic concepts of special relativity has been well remarked by r.f .",
    "feynman who , in his _ lectures _  ( ref .  ) , derives the relativistic expressions of momentum and energy in a way that closely resembles einstein s one .",
    "( feynman s derivation is however marred by his use of the `` relativistic mass '' . )",
    "einstein s argument has been more recently discussed by  f.  flores ,  @xcite who identifies three closely related but different claims within the mass - energy equivalence concept , and compares einstein s 1935 argument with his original 1905 derivation  @xcite and with m.  friedman s 1983 derivation ,  @xcite which rests upon the consideration of newton s equations in special relativity .    in this note ,",
    "i present this line of thought in the hope that it may be found useful for the presentation of these fundamental concepts of special relativity in introductory courses for students of physics and mathematics . while the derivation of the relativistic expression of momentum  in sec .",
    "[ sec : qdm ] is close to epstein s and  feynman s arguments , the discussion of the expression of the kinetic energy and of the mass - energy equivalence is closer to einstein s one .",
    "following einstein s  1905 paper  ( ref .  ) , the kinematic concepts of special relativity rest on the following postulates :    1 .",
    "the laws that govern the transformations of the state of physical systems take the same form in reference frames animated by uniform translational motion one with respect to the other .",
    "2 .   there is a class of such reference frames ( the _ inertial frames _ ) in which the speed of light assumes the same value @xmath2 , independently of the state of motion of its source .",
    "we shall choose from now on units in which @xmath3 and limit our considerations to inertial frames .",
    "based on these postulates one can easily derive lorentz transformations in the following form . let us consider two reference frames , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such that @xmath5 is in uniform translational motion in the positive  @xmath6 direction and with speed  @xmath7 with respect to  @xmath4 . then the event of coordinates @xmath8 in @xmath5 has in @xmath4 the coordinates @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and we have defined @xmath11 the same relation holds for the differentials  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc . dividing by @xmath12 we obtain the rules for the transformation of velocities : @xmath14    to introduce dynamical concepts we obviously need supplementary postulates .",
    "we shall therefore postulate the following :    1 .",
    "the momentum @xmath15 and the energy @xmath16 of a particle possessing the velocity @xmath17 in the reference frame @xmath4 have respectively the expressions @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant , that can be called the _",
    "rest energy _ , @xmath20 is a positive constant ( which is _ relativistically invariant _ , i.e. , does not change from one inertial frame to another , and thus _ does not depend on the particle s velocity _ ) which we shall simply call its _ mass _ , and @xmath21 and  @xmath22 are _ monotonically increasing _ universal functions of @xmath23 .",
    "the fact that the functions @xmath24 and  @xmath25 depend only on the magnitude @xmath26 of the velocity , but not on its direction , can be inferred by the isotropy of space .",
    "2 .   for @xmath27",
    "these expressions reduce to the well - known classical ones .",
    "one has in particular @xmath28 3 .",
    "the total momentum @xmath29 and the total energy @xmath30 of a system of several particles are respectively given by the sum of  @xmath15 and of  @xmath16 running over all the particles of the system .",
    "* conservation of momentum and energy : * let us assume that ( elastic or inelastic ) collisions occur in a system of particles . then , in each reference frame , @xmath29 and  @xmath30 maintain the same values before and after each collision .",
    "as a corollary , the velocity of each particle remains constant as long as no collision occurs , because one can consider systems made up of single , independent particles .",
    "let us now consider a _ particle pair _",
    ", i.e. , a system made of two particles with equal values of  @xmath20 . let us assume that in a reference frame  @xmath4 they have opposite velocities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath36 .",
    "let us moreover assume that the particles undergo an elastic collision , and take on respectively the velocities @xmath37 and  @xmath38 after it . by the conservation of momentum one must have @xmath39 and  @xmath40 , _ independently of the form of the function  @xmath21 .",
    "_ indeed , one has @xmath41 before the collision . by the conservation law",
    "one must have @xmath42 thus the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 are antiparallel , and one has @xmath45 since the function  @xmath21 is monotonically increasing , this equation can only be satisfied if  @xmath46 , and we have therefore @xmath47 .",
    "now energy conservation imposes @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , the total kinetic energy before the collision is given by @xmath49 , and after it is given by  @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath22 is a monotonically increasing function of  @xmath26 , this condition can only be satisfied if  @xmath51 .",

    "the @xmath6 component of the velocity  @xmath63 vanishes and that of the  @xmath64 velocity is equal to @xmath7 , and thus the speeds of the two particles are interchanged .",
    "let us now consider the conservation of momentum .",
    "the change @xmath65 of the momentum of particle  1 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the  @xmath52 axis versor .",
    "the corresponding quantity for particle  2 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "let us momentarily assume @xmath70 : then @xmath71 and @xmath72 . from momentum conservation",
    "we obtain @xmath73 , which implies @xmath74 since @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 having obtained this result for @xmath70 , it is easy to see that it also holds for larger values of @xmath77 and  @xmath78 , by substituting @xmath7 with the speed of the corresponding particle .",
    "we have in fact @xmath79 from which it follows @xmath80 namely @xmath81 an identity which is easy to check directly .",
    "let us consider a particle having the velocity @xmath82 , parallel to the  @xmath6 axis , in the  @xmath5 reference frame .",
    "its velocity  @xmath17 in the  @xmath4 frame , in uniform translational motion with respect to  @xmath5 with speed  @xmath7 in the direction of the positive @xmath6-axis , is given by @xmath83 , with @xmath84 one can easily see that @xmath85 if @xmath86 is not parallel to the  @xmath6 axis , but one has instead @xmath87 , one has the more general relation @xmath88 which can be obtained with a little algebra . it is also easy to check that @xmath89    let us now consider a particle pair , which have opposite velocities @xmath90 , @xmath54 in the @xmath5 frame .",
    "thus @xmath91 is the common value of the particles speed in the @xmath5 frame .",
    "let us denote by @xmath31 and @xmath92 the corresponding velocities in the  @xmath4 frame .",
    "we obtain @xmath93 we have seen that an elastic collision in the  @xmath4 frame can not change the common value @xmath94 of the particles speed .",
    "thus the right - hand side of this equation can not change in the collision .",
    "but then neither can its left - hand side .",
    "if we denote by @xmath43 and  @xmath44 the particles speeds in the  @xmath4 frame after the collision , we obtain @xmath95 as einstein  ( ref .  )",
    "points out , these equations have the form of conservation laws .",
    "we can thus interpret@xcite @xmath96 as the kinetic energy @xmath97 of a particle with mass  @xmath20 animated by a velocity  @xmath17 . for small values of",
    "@xmath26 this quantity is thus given by @xmath98 in agreement with the classical limit .",
    "we can thus set @xmath99 let us remark moreover that , by applying eqs .",
    "( [ eq : momentum ] ) to a particle pair , we obtain @xmath100 we can thus derive the following relation : @xmath101 which can be interpreted as the conservation law for the momentum . we thus recover the relativistic expression of the momentum derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : qdm ] .",
    "let us now consider a totally inelastic collision in a particle pair . in the reference frame @xmath5 in which @xmath102 , the total kinetic energy before the collision is given by @xmath103 for simplicity , we shall assume that the particles velocities @xmath104 are parallel to the @xmath52 axis",
    ". the total kinetic energy after the collision vanishes , but the energy of the resulting particle has increased by  @xmath105 . by momentum conservation",
    "the resulting particle is at rest in the reference frame  @xmath5 and has thus velocity  @xmath106 parallel to the @xmath6 axis in the  @xmath4 frame .",
    "let us denote by  @xmath107 its mass .",
    "in the  @xmath4 frame the total momentum before the collision is given by @xmath108 while after the collision it has the value @xmath109 we obtain therefore @xmath110 therefore when two particles collide inelastically to form a new particle , the mass of the resulting particle is larger than the sum of the masses of the colliding particles by a quantity exactly equal , in our units , to the kinetic energy transformed by the collision into other energy forms .",
    "one can thus introduce a `` natural '' choice of the energy at rest @xmath19 of a particle , by equating it ( in our units ) to its mass , also because , `` from the nature of the concept , [ that ] is determined only to within an additive constant , one can stipulate that @xmath19 should vanish together with @xmath20.''@xcite .",
    "we can then identify @xmath111 with the total energy of a particle , and associate the change  @xmath112 of energy from the kinetic to a different form with a change @xmath113 of the mass of the particle . in the more general case , in which the two particles do not coalesce , but are animated by velocities with the same magnitude @xmath114 in the @xmath5 frame after the collision , one can then express the conservation of energy by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mass of each particle after the collision .",
    "the same applies in the  @xmath4 frame , if we take into consideration the relation @xmath117 which holds since both @xmath31 and  @xmath92 are parallel to the  @xmath52 axis .",
    "it is then a simple matter to verify that the energy @xmath16 and the momentum @xmath15 of a particle of mass  @xmath20 satisfy the relation @xmath118 where the right - hand side is relativistically invariant .",
    "this relation also holds in the limit of a zero - mass particle , for which it assumes the form @xmath119 as a corollary , _ mass is not additive _ :",
    "the mass of a system of particles depends on its total energy content in the vanishing - momentum frame .",
    "thus when light waves ( of vanishing mass ) with opposite momenta are emitted from a particle at rest , the mass of the particle changes ( as argued in einstein s 1905 work ,  ref .  ) . since the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epm ] ) is invariant , it can be taken as the starting point to show that the energy @xmath16 and the momentum @xmath15 combine into a relativistic four - vector , a property which generalizes to particle systems .",
    "one should point out that this line of thought does not rest on maxwell s equations ( keeping only the constancy of the speed of light ) and neither does on other mechanical concepts , in particular on the concept of force , that is difficult to justify in special relativity .",
    "einstein criticizes the use of the concept of force in the derivation of the relativistic expression of momentum , contained in the book by g.d .",
    "birkhoff and  r.e .",
    "langer , _ relativity and modern physics _ ,  @xcite exactly for this reason , as made clear by the closing paragraphs of his 1935 paper :  @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ thus , in the book just mentioned , essential use is made of the concept of force , which in the relativity theory has no such direct significance as it has in classical mechanics .",
