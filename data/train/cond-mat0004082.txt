    "however this picture is too simplified since contributions from different orders of tunneling have different temperature - dependent prefactors and one can not in general specify the tunneling process that dominates for given junction resistances and temperature . in the strong tunneling regime perturbation theory breaks down and a number of higher order tunneling processes have to be taken into account simultaneously .    when the thermal energy is not much smaller than the charging energy , the semiclassical formula ( [ trse ] ) can be modified to fit the tmr values by replacing the coulomb charging energy by a renormalized charging energy .",
    "this substitution agrees well with the results of earlier investigations on the single - electron box.@xcite the renormalization scheme also predicts that the effective charging energy at sufficiently low temperature decreases for larger junction conductances due to the coupling to the leads .",
    "this means that for a given temperature , the tmr in the strong tunneling regime is smaller for larger junction conductances .",
    "the role of strong tunneling is therefore _",
    "dual_.@xcite the constructive role is to increase the tmr by the inclusion of higher order tunneling processes at low temperature .",
    "the destructive role is caused by the renormalized charging energy to a smaller value @xmath192 so that the tmr is closer to the classical value at a given temperature .",
    "when the thermal energy is much smaller than the coulomb charging energy strong tunneling is manifested as an enhancement of the tmr by lowering the temperature .",
    "we compute the tmr values for two values of the classical total dimensionless conductance @xmath190 and @xmath193 .",
    "for a given conductance @xmath194 and temperature the phase - phase correlation function ( [ phasephase ] ) is computed via monte - carlo simulations for a sufficiently large number of discrete points in the imaginary time interval @xmath195 $ ] .",
    "the phase - phase correlation functions after two succeeding @xmath196 samplings are compared .",
    "if the curves are smooth and sufficiently close to each other , they predict roughly the same conductance after the analytical continuation of the matsubara - fourier components .",
    "the small difference determines the uncertainty of the final result , which is shown as the size of the data point in the figures below . when the deviation between the two phase - phase correlation functions is larger than the requested accuracy they are averaged to give the phase - phase correlation function for the case of @xmath197 samplings , and a further simulation is performed for the next case of @xmath197 samplings .",
    "this procedure is followed until the final result converges . using the computed phase - phase correlation functions , the conductances of the tmr",
    "can be calculated via the kubo s formula eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) . the analytical continuation from the matsubara frequency to the real frequency@xcite",
    "is performed via the pde approximate.@xcite    the resulting tmr ratio in the absence of the gate voltage is shown in fig .",
    "( [ tmroff ] ) for @xmath190 and 24 . in both cases ,",
    "the tmr values at low temperature are larger than the classical values , which shows that the tmr is enhanced by higher order tunneling processes in the coulomb blockade regime . for @xmath190 at @xmath198 , the tmr is enhanced by a factor of 8 compared to the classical value , which is almost twice as large as the value that we reported for @xmath199 in our previous work.@xcite for a given temperature , the tmr for @xmath190 is larger than the one for @xmath193 in the temperature region shown in fig .",
    "( [ tmroff ] ) , which means that the smearing of the coulomb charging energy via higher order tunneling processes is stronger for larger junction conductances .",
    "therefore for experimentally easily accessible temperatures , only moderate enhancement of the tmr for the fset formed by tunnel junctions with extremely large conductances can be obtained . in order to experimentally observe large tmr ratios in set s tunnel conductances of the order of 10 times the quantum conductance",
    "are recommended .      in the on-state when @xmath200 module @xmath201 , there is no coulomb blockade effect even when the thermal energy is much smaller than the charging energy . in the sequential tunneling regime ,",
    "the conductance of the fset approaches half of the classical value when the temperature is lowered.@xcite beyond the sequential tunneling regime , the reduction of the conductance of the fset by lowering the temperature is slow at relatively high temperatures , but at sufficiently low temperature the conductance attains values smaller than the conductance in the sequential tunneling regime.@xcite the conductance in the on-state in the strong tunneling limit and its implication for the tmr will be investigated in this section .    in order to calculate the on-state conductance in the strong tunneling regime by monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we reformulate the phase - phase correlation function as @xmath202 where the function @xmath203 is the mean value of the phase factor @xmath204 } \\cos ( \\pi k ) \\times \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\cos [ \\varphi ( \\tau ) -\\varphi ( 0)]\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with respect to the partition function @xmath205 which is a direct summation of the density matrices for all winding numbers @xmath189 , @xmath206 } $ ] and the partition function at resonance is renormalized in a similar way , @xmath207 } \\cos ( \\pi k ) \\ , .\\ ] ] in the above formulas , both the numerator and the denominator of the phase - phase correlation function @xmath208 can be calculated with respect to the density matrices of the fset with a geometric factor which equals one .",
    "the computation can therefore be performed in the same way as in the case of vanishing gate voltage .",
    "the complication is that we now have to calculate both @xmath203 and @xmath209 instead of a single correlation function .",
    "when the thermal energy is not much smaller than the charging energy , quantum fluctuations are small and the simulations are rather fast . consequently the stable phase - phase correlation functions can be readily obtained using the approach described above .",
    "a typical result is shown in fig .",
    "( [ phasephase2 ] ) . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the imaginary time @xmath210 is longer , and more lattice points are needed to guarantee the convergence of the trotter product .",
    "moreover , the computed correlation functions for the same amount of sampling numbers turn out to fluctuate more strongly at lower temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "( [ phasephase3 ] ) . for @xmath190 at @xmath211 and @xmath193 at @xmath212 , the correlation functions computed via the approach of doubling the sampling number still fluctuate considerably within a realistic computing time .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to perform simulations for temperatures lower than @xmath213 . at the lowest temperature",
    "the correlation function at the points with large fluctuations is replaced by a best fit smooth function so that the analytical continuations in the kubo s formula lead to a converging conductance of the fset .",
    "the accuracy of this smoothing approach needs to be determined by long time monte carlo simulations in the future , since we can not guarantee that the single data point at the lowest temperature is accurate within its size .",
    "the tmr ratio as a function of the inverse dimensionless temperature is shown in fig .",
    "( [ tmron ] ) . for @xmath190 , the tmr first increases by lowering the temperature .",
    "the values are almost the same as the case of the vanishing gate voltage . around @xmath214 , the gate voltage dependent contributions to",
    "the tmr becomes important shifting the tmr value for @xmath7 farther away from the value for @xmath215 at lower temperatures .",
    "therefore while the tmr in the coulomb blockade regime is enhanced further at lower temperatures , the tmr at resonance decreases rapidly to the values smaller than the classical tmr for @xmath216 .",
    "negative tmr values could possibly occur at even lower temperatures , which needs to be determined quantitatively by further investigations which at present can not be performed due to the computing time required . for @xmath193 , in contrast to the case of smaller junction conductances",
    "@xmath190 , the tmr increases constantly and slowly by lowering the temperature down to a value of @xmath217 .",
    "the curve more or less follows the tendency of the tmr in the case of vanishing gate voltage .",
    "this is understandable because the gate voltage dependent contributions to the tmr is proportional to the factor @xmath218 as expressed in ( [ trse_delta ] ) , which is smaller for larger @xmath194 , therefore the difference between the maximal tmr at @xmath215 and the minimal tmr at @xmath7 determined by the gate voltage dependent contribution is also smaller , and the variation of the minimal tmr will change the direction at lower temperatures . in both cases ,",
    "the difference between the maximal tmr and the minimal tmr is found to be larger at lower temperatures , therefore a wider variation range of the tmr can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage .",
    "we have derived a general formula for the linear conductance of single - electron transistors containing ferromagnetic elements . in f - n - f structures ,",
    "the tmr is almost independent of the coulomb charging energy and is only _ reduced _ at sufficiently low temperatures when the effective transport dwell time becomes shorter than the spin - flip relaxation time of the normal - metallic island . in f - f - f systems , we have calculated the magneto - resistance as a function of gate voltages for a wide range of temperatures in the strong tunneling regime . in the off-state",
    ", the magneto - resistance can be enhanced at low temperatures by higher order tunneling processes .",
    "however , higher order tunneling processes also reduce the effective charging energy , and slow down the rate of the enhancement of the magneto - resistance when the junction conductances are much larger than the quantum conductance . consequently the largest magneto - resistance for a given temperature is obtained when the junction conductances are larger , but not very much larger than the quantum conductance .",
    "the magneto - resistance of the device in the on state has a more complicated temperature dependence . due to the contributions from the induced charges , the magneto - resistance increases slowly for very large junction conductances .",
    "in contrast to this , the magneto - resistance is reduced well below the classical magneto - resistance for not very large junction conductances at sufficiently low temperatures .",
