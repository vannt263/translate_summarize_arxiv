    "since the pioneering work of , the study of the chemical composition of the solar photosphere has been an important topic in astronomy .",
    "russell , measuring the strength of the absorption lines in the observed solar spectrum , determined the abundance of 56 elements and six molecules . after this work",
    "many other astronomers analysed the solar spectrum in order to deduce the detailed pattern of photospheric abundances .",
    "the accurate determination of the solar chemical abundances is a major topic , because :    1 .",
    "the knowledge of the elemental abundances in the present solar photosphere is the basis to infer the chemical composition of the initial sun , and allows one to reconstruct the past and future evolution of the sun , including its physical and chemical internal structure ; 2 .",
    "the comparison of the chemical abundances in the solar photosphere and in meteoritic samples provides important information about the formation and chemical evolution of the solar system ; 3 .",
    "the construction of detailed models of the solar atmosphere requires the knowledge of its chemical composition ; 4 .",
    "the knowledge of the solar photospheric chemical abundance allows the empirical determination of the oscillator strength of any spectral line of this element observable in the solar spectrum ; 5 .",
    "the solar abundances serve as a reference for the chemical analysis of other stars in the galaxy , of the interstellar medium , and of the stellar populations of external galaxies .",
    "in our analysis of the solar photosphere we are mainly interested in the first and third point .    for our work on the solar abundance determinations , we rely on a co@xmath2bold  3d model of the solar photosphere .",
    "we were interested to understand if the presence of horizontal fluctuations ( the solar granulation ) has a systematic effect on the abundances derived from the 3d model with respect to what is obtained by 1d models which ignore granulation .",
    "we find that the effects of granular fluctuations can lead to both positive and negative abundance corrections , depending on the properties of the individual spectral line under consideration .",
    "however , the granulation effect is relevant only in a few particular cases .",
    "3d effects are not responsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years .    in the following sections we summarise the investigations of some elements we have already published , and present a new analysis of some other elements ( li , k , fe , and os ) . for a complete overview of the solar abundance determinations we recommend the review by as a very detailed and complete work .",
    "our abundance analyses of the solar photosphere are based on a time - dependent , 3d , hydrodynamical model atmosphere computed with the co@xmath2bold  code [ http://www.astro.uu.se/~bf/co5bold_20020216/cobold.html ] ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the 3d model atmosphere we use has a box size of @xmath3 , a resolution of @xmath4 grid points , and spans a range in optical depth of about @xmath5 ( from @xmath6  mm below to @xmath7  mm above @xmath8 ) .",
    "the selected 19 snapshots we use for the spectrum - synthesis calculations are equidistantly spaced in time , sufficiently separated in time to show little correlation , and cover 1.2hours of solar time . for comparison ,",
    "the following 1d plane - parallel model atmospheres were considered :    1 .   the @xmath9  model obtained by horizontally averaging each 3d snapshot over surfaces of equal ( rosseland ) optical depth ; 2 .   the @xmath10  model , a 1d hydrostatic mixing - length model which employs the same micro - physics and radiative transfer scheme as co@xmath2bold ; 3 .   the semi - empirical holweger - mller solar model ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , hereafter hm ) ; 4 .   the atlas-9 model computed by f. castelli [ http://wwwuser.oats.inaf.it/castelli/sun/ap00t5777g44377k1asp.dat ] with the solar abundances of .",
    "the @xmath9  and @xmath10  models have been introduced as reference 1d models , because they share the microphysics with the 3d model @xcite . for more details about the 1d and",
    "3d models used in our analysis see or the other papers of the collaboration on the determination of the solar photospheric abundances .",
    "we investigated the effects of 3d convection on solar abundances in . to define 3d corrections we selected two reference models : @xmath9  and @xmath10 .",
    "both share the microphysics of the 3d - co@xmath2bold  model to ensure differential comparability .",
    "we distinguish two different 3d corrections , defined as : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents any chemical element , and @xmath14 .",
    "the first correction isolates the granulation effects , _",
    "i.e. _ the influence of the horizontal fluctuations around the mean stratification , while the second one measures the total 3d effect , accounting for both horizontal fluctuations and for the different influence of 3d hydrodynamical and 1d mixing - length convection , respectively , on the resulting _",
    "mean _ temperature structure . obviously , both 3d corrections depend on the choice of the microturbulence parameter , [ @xmath15 , used with the 1d models , while the second one is also a function of the mixing length parameter , [ @xmath16 , adopted for the @xmath10  model .",
    "the idea is that these 3d corrections can be derived from the simulations with much better accuracy than the detailed thermal structure of the solar atmosphere in absolute terms . while the latter depends sensitively on _",
    "e.g. _ , the frequency binning adopted for the radiation hydrodynamics , the 3d corrections are less sensitive to such details , as they are defined in a strictly differential way .",
    "hence , the 3d corrections are not merely evaluated to measure the abundance difference between a given pair of 3d and 1d models , but they may rather be utilised to improve the abundance determinations from standard 1d models .",
    "abundances derived from the semi - empirical hm model should be corrected by adding only the `` granulation correction '' @xmath17 , while abundances based on standard 1d mixing - length models like atlas or marcs , must be corrected by adding the `` total 3d correction '' @xmath18 .",
    "the 3d corrections are well defined as long as the considered lines are weak such that their equivalent widths are independent of the assumed microturbulence .",
    "the situation becomes more problematic once the lines are partly saturated , because then the corrections depend on @xmath19 , and the choice of the microturbulence parameter is critical . in principle , the microturbulence parameter derived empirically from analysing observed solar spectra with a standard 1d model , @xmath19(sun-1x ) , should be identical with the theoretical microturbulence @xmath19(hydro-@xmath10 ) , obtained from analysing the synthetic spectrum of the 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere with the @xmath10  model .",
    "however , there are indications that @xmath19(hydro-@xmath10 ) is systematically smaller than @xmath19(sun-1x ) @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the 3d corrections should be computed with @xmath19(hydro-@xmath10 ) . wherever possible ,",
    "abundances from weak lines are to be preferred .",
    "for some of the weak lines that we investigated ( _ e.g. _ the line at 538 nm ) , we compared the 3d correction @xmath20 with the results of , which are based on a 2d hydrodynamical simulation , and find a close agreement .",
    "summarising our analysis , we can say that the total 3d correction @xmath21 is positive for the majority of the relevant spectral lines , except for a few weak , high - excitation lines ( mostly nitrogen ) for which both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are negative . however , the 3d corrections are small in general .",
    "the abundances presented in this work have been derived directly from the 3d model , in line with our previous publications .",
    "we trust in the temperature structure of our 3d - co@xmath2bold  model , because it is able to reproduce the centre - to - limb variation of the continuum intensity even somewhat better than the hm model @xcite . however , we plan to compute abundances also with the alternative approach , _",
    "i.e. _ from the hm model and correcting by @xmath17 , in future investigations .",
    "while it is not entirely clear which of the two approaches gives the more reliable results , we propose the abundance differences between the two methods to be considered as a measure of the systematic uncertainty of the abundance analysis .",
    "our analysis is based on mainly four high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio [ s / n ] spectra , two for disc centre , and two for the integrated disc . for most elements we use more than one solar spectrum , because we realised that the abundance derived from different spectra do not always agree within one @xmath22 .",
    "the observed spectra we considered are :    1 .   the integrated disc spectrum based on fifty solar fts scans taken by j. brault and l. testerman at kitt peak between 1981 and 1984 @xcite ; 2 .   the two absolutely calibrated fts spectra obtained at kitt peak in the 1980s , covering the range 330 nm to 1250 nm for the integrated disc and disc centre @xcite ; 3 .",
    "the disc centre intensity spectrum in the range 300 nm to 1000 nm observed from the jungfraujoch @xcite , and in the range from 1000 nm to 5400 nm observed from kitt peak @xcite .",
    "lithium is widely studied in metal - poor stars .",
    "the resonance doublet at 670.7 nm is also observable in the solar spectrum and in the spectra of f ",
    "k main sequence stars . in metal - poor stars ,",
    "this region is very clean , and the lithium feature is not blended .",
    "this is not the case in solar - metallicity stars , where atomic and molecular lines contaminate the region .",
    "good atomic data for these blending lines are not readily available in databases , but there are a few published line lists that have been used for the abundance analysis of the solar photosphere . for our own analysis of li in the solar photosphere",
    ", we took into account both granulation and 3d - nlte effects in computing the contribution of the li doublet , while 3d - lte line formation calculations were performed for the other blend components .",
    "considering the four solar atlases described above to investigate lithium , we realise that the two observed intensity spectra are significantly different ( see figure[fig : liint ] ) .",
    "we have no explanation for this disagreement .",
    "the easiest way to explain it would be to invoke telluric absorption , but this spectral range has been carefully scrutinised in the context of the li isotopic ratio in metal - poor stars , and it seems unlikely that a telluric absorption could have gone unnoticed .",
    "we decided to discard the delbouille disc centre atlas , and to work only with the other three atlases for the li abundance determination .",
    "the reason for discarding the delbouille disc centre atlas is that we can not reproduce the profile with synthetic spectra , while we can in the case of the other three solar atlases , and obtain li abundances that agree closely .",
    "the two lists of blending lines that can reproduce the solar spectrum in this region reasonably well are those from and from . to obtain the li abundance",
    ", we fit the observed line profile , interpolating in a grid of 3d synthetic spectra , in which nlte effects are taken into account for li .",
    "we obtain @xmath23(li)@xmath24 , fitting the three observed line profiles using the line list .",
    "fortunately , the solar lithium abundance is not very sensitive to the choice between the two line lists : when using the list , we obtain @xmath23(li)@xmath25 .      for a selection of 45 lines , we measured the equivalent widths , taking into account the blending components , when present , and we obtained @xmath23(c)@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "nlte corrections were computed with the kiel code @xcite , using the @xmath9  model as input . in our sample of lines",
    "there is one forbidden line at 872.7 nm , formed in lte conditions .",
    "its abundance of a(c)=@xmath27 is very close to the value we obtain from the complete sample .",
    "a considerable fraction of our selected lines are strong , in the saturated part of the curve of growth .",
    "we do not see a trend of the carbon abundance with respect to the equivalent widths of the lines , and the a(c ) is unchanged if we consider only lines whose ew is smaller than 12 pm .",
    "when we consider lines weaker than 8 pm of equivalent width , a(c ) is lower of 0.02dex .",
    "our analysis relies on two sets of equivalent width measurements @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen abundance is obtained by interpolating in synthetic curves - of - growth from 3d and 1d models . to account for nlte effects",
    ", we applied the corrections computed in using the @xmath9  as the 1d background stratification .",
    "the result is @xmath23(n)@xmath28 , as reported in detail by and .",
    "criticise our line selection , but unfortunately provide no information on their own analysis , except their line - to - line scatter of 0.04dex .",
    "we note that the difference between the abundance from their atomic and molecular nh @xmath29 lines is about 0.1dex .",
    "our photospheric oxygen abundance of @xmath30 is derived from ten atomic oxygen lines .",
    "the nlte corrections are computed from the @xmath9  model as input to the kiel code , and applied to the 3d - lte abundances . for details of the analysis",
    "see and . in our analysis",
    "we find a disagreement between the two forbidden [ oi ] lines at 630 nm and 636 nm of more than 0.1dex that we are not able to explain , unless we allow the contribution of the nickel blend of the line at 630 nm to be smaller than expected by about a factor of two ( see also ) .",
    "interestingly , already considered the presence of the line , but concluded that such contribution must be small to have an agreement between the two [ oi ] lines .",
    "this disagreement is not present in , while in a disagreement is recognised , but no solution is offered .",
    "when we use the equivalent widths given by together with our 3d model , we find indeed an agreement between the two lines , but with a `` high '' @xmath23(o ) value of 8.79 and 8.76 , respectively , while give @xmath23(o ) = 8.69 and 8.67 for the two forbidden lines . this difference is probably related to differences in the temperature structure of the two independent 3d model atmospheres .",
    "we considered five infrared lines of multiplet1 for the photospheric abundance determination @xcite .",
    "our photospheric phosphorus abundance of @xmath23(p)@xmath31 is in perfect agreement with the meteoritic value @xcite .",
    "the phosphorus abundance in is 0.06dex larger with respect to the value of @xmath23(p)@xmath32 given in .",
    "it is unclear whether this upward revision is related to their new 3d model or to a change in the line list , in the @xmath33 values , and/or the adopted equivalent widths .      in the photospheric sulphur abundance",
    "is given as @xmath23(s)@xmath34 and the meteoritic one as @xmath23(s)@xmath35 .",
    "we have studied several lines in the solar spectrum . from the weak forbidden line at 1082 nm we obtain @xmath23(s)@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "criticise both the measured equivalent widths as being too small , and the @xmath33  we ( and also ) use as being obsolete , claiming that updated values should be used . as no further details",
    "are given , it is impossible to judge whether their equivalent widths and @xmath33 values are better .",
    "we considered also the permitted lines of multiplet3 , multiplet6 , and multiplet8 , discarding the strong lines of multiplet1 at 920 nm , because they are blended with telluric absorption @xcite .",
    "both lines of multiplet6 and multiplet8 are weak and close to lte .",
    "the abundance we find is @xmath23(s)@xmath37 from the line of multiplet8 , and @xmath23(s)@xmath38 from the two lines of multiplet6 .",
    "the lines of multiplet3 at 1045 nm are affected by departures from lte .",
    "if we take this effect into account , using the nlte correction of , we obtain @xmath23(s)@xmath39 .",
    "this value becomes @xmath23(s)@xmath40 when using the nlte corrections computed by s. andrievsky and s. korotin with the sulphur model atom described in and .",
    "the simple average over all of the multiplets would give @xmath23(s)@xmath41 , where @xmath22 is the root - mean - square deviation .",
    "giving twice the weight to the [ si ] lines and the lines of multiplet8 because they are unaffected by nlte , we obtain @xmath23(s)@xmath42 , which we recommend as the solar photospheric value .      in the solar spectrum ,",
    "potassium is observed through lines of the neutral species , . as for other alkalines ,",
