    "<S> since defects are , in principle , observable , they provide an excellent experimental signature for the way in which transitions are implemented .    for condensed matter systems , which include the long annular josephson tunnel junctions ( jtjs ) that we shall discuss below , zurek@xcite suggested that causality alone is sufficient to determine the initial density of defects arising in a continuous transition . in this </S>",
    "<S> he paralleled proposals made by kibble@xcite in the context of quantum field theory models of the early universe .    </S>",
    "<S> as applied to jtjs , the idea is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> consider a thin linear jtj with critical temperature @xmath3 , cooled through that temperature so that , if @xmath4 is the temperature at time @xmath5 , then @xmath6 . @xmath7 defines the quench time @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> the first time that fluxons ( or josephson vortices ) , the defects of linear jtjs , can appear is at time @xmath14 , when @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the case in hand , @xmath14 has the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the relaxation time of the longest wavelength modes . </S>",
    "<S> details are given in papers @xcite by two of us ( r.m and r.r ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , @xmath18 . if @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is simply related to @xmath22 , the cold fluxon size , then the initial domain size and fluxon separation is predicted to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we term @xmath0 the zurek - kibble ( zk ) characteristic index .    </S>",
    "<S> the arguments are not specific to jtjs . </S>",
    "<S> prior to our experiment , five other condensed matter experiments had been performed to test the prediction ( [ xibar ] ) for the separation of defects at their production , two experiments@xcite on superfluid @xmath25 , two@xcite on superfluid @xmath26 , and one@xcite on high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an experiment@xcite on jtjs by two of us ( r.m and j.m ) was compatible with ( [ xibar ] ) , although it had not been performed with a test of ( [ xibar ] ) in mind . before discussing our new experiment </S>",
    "<S> a few comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments@xcite on superfluid @xmath27 rely on the fact that , when it is bombarded with slow neutrons , @xmath28kev . </S>",
    "<S> the energy released in such a collision leads to a hot spot which , when cooled by its environment below @xmath3 , leaves behind a tangle of vortices ( the topological defects in this system ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is fixed by the nuclear process that breaks up the @xmath25 atom . with only a single data point conflating both normalisation and @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to confirm the predicted value @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , both experiments are highly compatible with ( [ xibar ] ) , agreeing to a factor of a few in each case .    in principle , the @xmath26 experiments@xcite , which use a pressure quench with a varying timescale @xmath8 to implement the transition , allow for a more complete test . yet </S>",
    "<S> again , vortices are the relevant defects . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , the most reliable experiment@xcite sees no vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this is not necessarily a sign of failure in that it has been suggested@xcite that the vortices decay too fast to be seen . </S>",
    "<S> this is irrespective@xcite of whether a pressure quench , which preserves high thermal fluctuations , would of itself lead to somewhat different predictions . in this context , the vortices seen in an earlier @xmath26 experiment@xcite were most likely an artefact of the experimental setup .    </S>",
    "<S> the fifth experiment@xcite , on high-@xmath30superconductors , measures total flux through a surface carried by the abrikosov vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex separation of ( [ xibar ] ) can be converted into a prediction for the flux , but no flux is seen in contradiction with this prediction , despite the phase separation that leads to the result being demonstrated elsewhere@xcite . in this case there is no obvious explanation of the null result , despite later work @xcite that takes the effect of gauge fields into account fully .    in summary , these early experiments ( including @xcite ) have either provided _ one _ data point for ( [ xibar ] ) , or have been null . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , two experiments of a very different type have been performed that permit varying quench rates and so an estimate for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent@xcite involves the b@xmath31nard - marangoni conduction - convection transition . </S>",
    "<S> the defects here are not associated with the line zeroes of an order parameter field , and the viscosity - dependent @xmath32 does not match the zk prediction , most likely for that reason . </S>",
    "<S> the more relevant experiment@xcite is carried out in a non - linear optical system , with complex beam - phase the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the light intensity ( the control parameter in this case ) leads to pattern formation ( defects ) at a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted @xmath29 is recovered to good accuracy , but agreement with normalisation is not stated .    our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> whose methodology and results we outline below , is also one in which , by varying @xmath8 , we can measure and compare @xmath0 with its theoretical value , as well as confirming overall scale .    in its essence , we quench a long annular jtj through its critical temperature and count such fluxons or josephson vortices as appear . in its idealised form </S>",
    "<S> the annular jtj consists of two dimensionally identical annuli of superconductors of narrow width , superimposed upon one another , separated by an insulating barrier in the same plane . in practice , it is sufficient for the lower superconductor to be a planar substrate upon which the other annulus sits . </S>",
    "<S> the effective theory for fluxons in jtjs@xcite is the sine - gordon model with respect to the field @xmath33 , the difference in the phases of the complex order parameter fields in the separate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson vortices are then the sine - gordon kinks .    </S>",
    "<S> the jtjs in our experiment are _ symmetric _ , by which is meant that the electrodes are made of identical superconducting material with the same energy gaps and the same @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by seeing that a ) there is no logarithmic singularity in the voltage - current characteristic at finite voltages and b ) the temperature dependence of the critical current is linear as @xmath34 approaches @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome is that@xcite @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at the time of their formation the separation of fluxons is expected to be given by ( [ xibar ] ) with @xmath29 .    in terms of the parameters of the jtjs , the josephson length at temperature @xmath36 is@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the critical josephson current at temperature @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> typically @xmath39 is in the @xmath40 range and was equal to @xmath41 for the sample discussed below . in ref.@xcite @xmath21 has been inferred as @xmath42 the parameter @xmath43 is given in terms of the superconductor gap energy @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> as for @xmath46 , it is given as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 defines the behavior @xmath49of the swihart velocity for the system near @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> if the thickness of the two superconducting electrodes differs , the effective thickness @xmath51 is the harmonic mean of the individual thicknesses@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our samples are high quality , @xmath52 long , @xmath53 wide , @xmath54 jtjs fabricated on @xmath55 thick silicon substrates using the trilayer technique ( sneap ) in which the junction is realized in the window opened in a @xmath56 insulator layer . </S>",
    "<S> details of the fabrication process can be found in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all samples the high quality has been inferred by a measure of the i - v characteristic at @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the subgap current @xmath58 at @xmath59was small compared to the current rise @xmath60 in the quasiparticle current at the gap voltage @xmath61 , typically @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap voltage was as large as @xmath63 and the maximum critical current @xmath64 was larger than @xmath65 for the overlap type junction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the application of a strong enough external magnetic field in the barrier plane completely suppressed any josephson structures indicating the absence of electrical shorts in the barrier . at an order of magnitude level </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath66ps and @xmath67 m . as a result @xmath68 mm for @xmath69s . </S>",
    "<S> we will be more specific later .    </S>",
    "<S> our jtjs have a critical temperature @xmath70 , whereas the individual superconductors have a critical temperature of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> even at our fastest quench the conductors are superconducting , by which is meant that the cooper - pair order parameter field has achieved its final magnitude , @xmath72 before the jtj can develop fluxons . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary for ( [ xibar ] ) to be valid without modification @xcite , since only then is @xmath73 the relevant order parameter .    in order to vary the quenching time over the widest possible range </S>",
    "<S> , we have realized the experimental setup shown schematically in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the annular jtj samples are fabricated on a chip ( shown endways on ) , mounted to a @xmath74 block by a thermally insulating teflon sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the entire system is enclosed in a vacuum - tight can immersed in the liquid @xmath75 bath . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the heat is removed from the system by @xmath75 exchange gas , using a manual pump . by varying the pressure of the gas we can modify the rate of cooling of the sample . on the other side of the block </S>",
    "<S> is a @xmath76 carbon resistor , that enables us to heat and cool the jtjs on a relatively long timescale ( @xmath77 from about @xmath78to @xmath79 ) depending on the he exchange gas pressure inside the can . with @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> , we need to vary @xmath81 by at least two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is not possible just by heating the block alone ( even if it were smaller ) . to extend the range of @xmath81 we mounted a small , pulse - driven , surface @xmath82 resistor on the same side </S>",
    "<S> this permits much smaller thermal cycles ( @xmath83to @xmath84 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two completely different quenching techniques provide timescale ranges that do not overlap , leaving a gap between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , that would require a third quenching technique to be filled .    </S>",
    "<S> the whole system is then enclosed in a @xmath87-metal shielded cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the jtj is monitored by measuring the junction gap voltage , which is proportional to the known superconductor gap energy @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> all quenches were taken from @xmath89 to @xmath90 through @xmath70 . by making use of the thouless equation@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to infer the temperature of the jtj from the gap voltage in the range @xmath91 to @xmath90 , extremely accurately at the upper end of the range , and with fluctuations of a few per cent at the lower . </S>",
    "<S> whether for slow or fast cooling an excellent fit to the temperature of the jtj in this range , for initial temperature @xmath92 and final temperature @xmath93 , is given by the thermal relaxation equation @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the relaxation time which sets the cooling timescale . </S>",
    "<S> see fig.2 for an example . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is then used to extrapolate @xmath96 to the vicinity of @xmath97 and yields @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> on cooling the system in this way , we expect fluxons to appear from the inhomogeneity of @xmath73 at the transition , according to ( [ xibar ] ) . in the absence of any current through the barrier or applied external magnetic field the fluxons are in indifferent equilibrium as far as the barrier is homogeneous and pin - hole free . </S>",
    "<S> ( in reality , there is a small pinning effect so that , after a short transient , the fluxons are static . ) to make them visible , and countable , we apply a bias current , whereby they move as magnetic dipoles under the resulting lorentz force , at speed less than the swihart velocity . according to josephson theory @xmath99 travelling fluxons ( and antifluxons ) with speed @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> develop a voltage @xmath101 across the junction , where @xmath102 is the flux in a ( josephson ) fluxon and @xmath103 is the annulus circumference </S>",
    "<S> . this voltage can be measured , and the fluxon number determined . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the experiment and the data will be given elsewhere@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many samples have been measured , but only one had such a large critical current density ( and sufficiently small @xmath104 ) that only 3000 thermal cycles were enough to get reliable statistics , and it is this sample that we shall discuss now . </S>",
    "<S> however , we stress that , within the less good statistics of the other samples , none gave results that were incompatible with ( [ xibar ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric annular jtj with which the experiment was performed had a circumference @xmath105 , and width @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective superconductor thickness was @xmath107 @xmath108 . at the final temperature @xmath93 , the critical current density was @xmath109 , the quality factor was @xmath110and the josephson length was @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity @xmath48 is calculated to be @xmath112@xmath113 . from this </S>",
    "<S> , we infer that @xmath114 and @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath116 for @xmath117 , several times the circumference of the jtj .    as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood of finding a single fluxon is small . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the probability of finding a fluxon in a single quench to be @xmath118 where , from ( [ xibar ] ) , @xmath119 .    in fig.3 we show a log - log plot for the measured @xmath120 as a function of @xmath77 , changed by varying the exchange gas pressure and by using both the fast and slow quenching techniques . </S>",
    "<S> each data point corresponds to 300 quenches . </S>",
    "<S> although the data does not distinguish between a single fluxon and a fluxon plus an antifluxon pair , the likelihood of the latter is sufficiently small that it can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the data does not distinguish between no fluxons and a fluxon - antifluxon pair , with similar errors . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the points are quite scattered , meaning that the data are statistically poor . </S>",
    "<S> further , for the reasons given earlier there is a gap between fast and slow quenches , with the possibility for systematic error . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we have clear evidence that i ) the trapping of a fluxon occurs on a purely statistical basis for identical conditions of each thermal cycle and ii ) the probability to trap one fluxon is larger when the transition is performed at a faster speed ( smaller quenching time ) in accordance with the causality principle . </S>",
    "<S> this complements our qualitative results from other samples with smaller @xmath121 ( for which the statistics is too poor to permit a fit to ( [ xibar ] ) ) that , at fixed @xmath81 , the probability of finding a fluxon decreases with increasing @xmath122 .    </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the data spread , to test ( [ p1 ] ) we attempted to fit the data with an allometric function @xmath123 , with @xmath124 and @xmath125 being free fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we found , for the coefficient @xmath124 , the best fitting value of @xmath126 ( taking @xmath8 in seconds ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in excellent agreement with the predicted value of @xmath127 , given the fact that we only expect agreement in overall normalization to somewhat better than an order of magnitude . after the failure of the experiments discussed in @xcite to find ( reliable ) defects at expected densities , </S>",
    "<S> if at all , this experiment shows that the zk estimate remains sensible . </S>",
    "<S> further , the best fitting curve , shown by the solid line in fig.3 , has a slope @xmath128 , in remarkable agreement with its predicted value of @xmath129 .    </S>",
    "<S> the zk scenario needs further testing with jtjs for which there is a greater likelihood of observing fluxons . in @xcite and @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we observed that this is the case for significantly non - symmetric jtjs , for which the value of @xmath0 is @xmath130 ; a further experiment , with markedly non - symmetric jtjs , is being planned .    </S>",
