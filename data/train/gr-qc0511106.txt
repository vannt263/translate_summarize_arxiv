    "the study of quasinormal modes in a black hole background spacetime has a long history @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is shown that their frequencies and damping times are entirely fixed by the black hole parameters and independent of the initial perturbations .",
    "therefore , it is certain that quasinormal modes carry the characteristic information about a black hole and it can provide a new and direct way for astrophysicists to search black hole in the universe .",
    "recently , a great deal of efforts@xcite-@xcite has been devoted to the study of the asymptotic quasinormal modes because that hod s conjecture@xcite shows that there maybe exist a connection between the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies and quantum gravity . in terms of bohr s correspondence principle",
    ", the transition frequencies at large quantum numbers ( @xmath5 ) should equal to classical oscillation frequencies .",
    "hod @xcite generalized bohr s correspondence principle to the black hole physics and regarded the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies ( @xmath6 ) as the characteristic transition frequency for the black hole .",
    "moreover , hod observed that the real parts of highly damped quasinormal frequencies in schwarzschild black hole can be expressed as @xmath7 , which is derived numerically by nollert@xcite and later confirmed analytically by motl @xcite@xcite and andersson @xcite .",
    "together with the first law of black hole thermodynamics , hod obtained the value of the fundamental area unit in the quantization of black hole horizon area .",
    "following hod s works , dreyer@xcite found that the asymptotic quasinormal modes can fix the barbero - immirzi parameter which is introduced as an indefinite factor by immirzi@xcite to obtain the right form of the black hole entropy in the loop quantum gravity .",
    "furthermore , dreyer obtained that the basic gauge group in the loop quantum gravity should be @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 .",
    "these exciting new results imply that hod s conjecture maybe create a new way to probe the quantum properties of black hole",
    ".    however , the question whether hod s conjecture applies to more general black holes still remain open . in their deduction , it is obvious that the factor @xmath10 in the quasinormal frequencies plays an essential and important role . in other word , whether hod s conjecture is valid depends on whether the factor @xmath10 appears in the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies or not .",
    "recently , we @xcite probed the asymptotic quasinormal modes of a massless scalar field in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime and find that the frequency spectra formula satisfies hod s conjecture . for the non - flat spacetime ,",
    "cardoso and yoshida @xcite@xcitefound the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in the schwarzschild de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes depend on the cosmological constant . only in the case that the cosmological constant vanishes , the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies returns @xmath3 . for the reissner - nordstrm black hole ,",
    "l. motl and a. neitzke@xcite found the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies satisfy @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath2 are the inverse black hole hawking temperatures of the outer and inner event horizons respectively .",
    "it is obvious that it is relevant of the electric charge @xmath13 and the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies do not equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the more perplexing is that the formula ( [ 01 ] ) does not return the schwarzschild limit as the black hole charge @xmath13 tends to zero .",
    "some authors suggested @xcite that hod s conjecture about @xmath14 is valid only in the pure gravitational perturbations case .",
    "the formula ( [ 01 ] ) does not return the schwarzschild limit as the black hole charge @xmath13 tends to zero because that it describe a complicated effect of the material - gravitational coupling .",
    "after considering the interaction between the matter and gravitational fields , hod s conjecture maybe possess a more general form .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study the contribution of the interaction between the matter and gravitational fields to the asymptotic quasinormal modes in the more general background spacetimes . recently , we @xcite studied the asymptotic quasinormal modes of a coupled scalar field in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime .",
    "we found that the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies depend both on the structure parameters of the background spacetime and on the coupling between the matter and gravitational fields .",
    "moreover , we noted that only in the minimal coupled case , the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies is consistent with hod s conjecture about @xmath3 .    in this paper , our main purpose is to investigate the asymptotic quasinormal modes of a coupled scalar field in the gibbons - maeda dilaton black hole background .",
    "our plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we derive analytically the asymptotic quasinormal frequency formula of a coupled scalar field in the gibbons - maeda dilaton spacetime by making use of the monodromy method . at last ,",
    "a summary and some discussions are presented .",
    "the metric for the gibbons - maeda dilaton spacetime is @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath13 represent the black hole magnetic and electric charges . when @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the metric returns the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime and the reissner - nordstrm spacetime respectively .",
    "we introduce a coordinate change @xmath21 and the metric ( [ gem01 ] ) can rewritten as @xmath22 the outer and inner horizons lie in @xmath23 .",
    "the general perturbation equation for a coupled massless scalar field in the dilaton spacetime is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scalar field and @xmath26 is the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "the coupling between the scalar and gravitational fields is represented by the term @xmath27 , where @xmath1 is a numerical couple factor .    after adopting wkb approximation @xmath28 , introducing the  tortoise coordinate \" change @xmath29}-\\frac{r'^2_--d^2}{r'_+-r'_- }    \\ln{\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{r^2+d^2}-r'_-}{r'_--d}\\right]},\\label{x2 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and substituting eqs.([gem02]),([x2 ] ) into eq.([eq1 ] )",

    ", for avoiding the inner horizon at @xmath37 , the selected contour only goes around the outer horizon at @xmath38 , where the boundary conditions and the monodromy are well defined .",
    "-plane and the contour @xmath35 .",
    "the regions with the hachures denote the area @xmath39.,width=302 ]    [ fig1 ]    in order to compute conveniently , we introduce the variable @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath42 . at the vicinity of the point @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath43 and the behaviors of the ricci scalar curvature and the potential are @xmath44 and @xmath45\\sim-\\frac{3 - 2\\xi}{16z^2}.\\label{v4 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we make the identification @xmath46 , and then the perturbation equation ( [ e3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath47 as before , from the boundary condition at point @xmath48 @xmath49 we easily obtain the asymptotic form of @xmath50 at the point marked @xmath48 is @xmath51 to follow the contour @xmath35 and approach to point @xmath52 , we first turn an angle @xmath53 around the origin point , corresponding to @xmath54 around @xmath42 . from the bessel function behavior near the origin point",
    ", we find that after the @xmath54 rotation the asymptotic are @xmath55 then we must go out along the lobe where the behavior of the wave function can be approximated as the purely oscillatory . after going around the lobe",
    ", we return to the bessel region a second time .",
    "however , in this time , we must add an additional distance to @xmath56 , namely , @xmath57 thus , the general solution of the eq.([e4 ] ) is @xmath58 in terms of the continuity and asymptotic behavior of the wave function , we have @xmath59 to approach the point @xmath52 , we must finally turn the second @xmath54 rotation around the point @xmath60 .",
    "the asymptotic forms of the wave function @xmath50 near the point @xmath52 becomes @xmath61 running over the large semicircle to come back to the point a , we find that the wave function @xmath62 must multiply the factor @xmath63 in the globe monodromy analysis of @xmath50 around the point @xmath64 , we find the coefficient of @xmath62 must be multiplied by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , is the inverse black hole hawking temperature of the outer event horizon . then matching the local and globe monodromies of the function @xmath50",
    ", we find the asymptotic quasinormal frequency spectra formula of a coupled scalar field in the gibbons - maeda spacetime is @xmath67-e^{-\\beta_i    \\omega}[2 + 2\\cos{(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\xi+1}}{2 } \\pi)}],\\label{w1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , is the inverse black hole hawking temperature of the inner event horizon . as our expectation , the asymptotic quasinormal frequency spectra formula of a coupled scalar field in the gibbons - maeda dilaton spacetime also depends on the coupling between the scalar and the gravitational fields .",
    "moreover , we find that as both @xmath19 and @xmath69 , the real part of quasinormal frequency becomes @xmath3 , which is consistent with hod s conjecture .",
    "we have investigated the analytical forms of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies for a coupled scalar field in the gibbons - maeda dilaton spacetime by adopting the monodromy technique . as in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime ,",
    "the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies depend not only on the structure parameters of the background spacetime , but also on a couple constant @xmath1 .",
    "the fact tells us again that the interaction between the matter and gravitational fields affects the frequencies spectra formula of the asymptotic quasinormal modes .",
    "moreover , the formulas ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ 01 ] ) look like very similar .",
    "both formulas have a correction term which come from the phase shift @xmath70 . as the formula ( [ 01 ] )",
    "can not yield the schwarzschild limit when the electric charge @xmath13 tends to zero , the frequency spectra formula ( [ w1 ] ) still does not return to the formula of a coupled scalar field in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton black hole as the magnetic charge @xmath18 approaches zero .",
    "similarly , the formula ( [ w1 ] ) also can not return that of in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime as @xmath71 approaches to zero .",
    "the mathematical reason for these behaviors is that the variable @xmath56 and the effective potential @xmath72 depend heavily on parameters @xmath71 and @xmath18 . in the cases @xmath20 and @xmath19 , the forms of the variable @xmath56 and the effective potential @xmath72 near the point @xmath42 are clear different from eqs.([z0 ] ) and ( [ v4 ] ) .",
    "however , when both @xmath1 and @xmath18 vanish , we find that the real part of quasinormal frequency in the gibbons - maeda dilaton spacetime can become @xmath3 , which agrees with that of a minimal coupled scalar field in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime . more interestingly , when @xmath4 , the formula ( [ w1 ] ) becomes @xmath73 , which is entirely consistent with that of the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime .",
    "this maybe imply that the coupling between the matter and gravitational field play an important role in the asymptotic quasinormal modes .",
    "the relation between the couple factor @xmath1 and the asymptotic quasinormal modes in more general spacetime need to be study more deeply in the future .",
