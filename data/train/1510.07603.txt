    "the main goal of the power system operator is to maintain the system in the normal secure state despite varying operating conditions .",
    "achievement of this goal necessitates continuous monitoring of the system condition , identification of the operating state and determination of the necessary control actions , which are referred to as the security analysis of a system @xcite .",
    "security assessment such as contingency analysis , optimal power flow and generation re - dispatch typically involves repeated computation based on the full nonlinear power system model , leading to enormous computational burden @xcite .",
    "in addition , the conventional security analysis strongly relies on an accurate system model and network topology , which may not be available due to erroneous telemetry from remotely monitored circuit breaker @xcite .",
    "the above factors pose great challenges to the static and dynamic security analysis for the modern power grids and make the online security analysis even more formidable",
    ". wide adoption of phasor measurement units ( pmus ) greatly facilitates online monitoring of system states and its dynamic behaviors , offering unique opportunities for the development of measurement - based security analysis methods in power system @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a hybrid measurement and model - based method to estimate the dynamic state jacobian matrix in near real - time , which provides invaluable information on system states and conditions .",
    "the proposed hybrid method nicely combines the statistical properties extracted from the pmu measurements and the inherent generator physics , working as a grey box bridging the measurement and the model .",
    "in addition , the estimation of the jacobian matrix does not require exhaustive computational effort and can be done in near real - time .",
    "furthermore , the estimation method is robust to network topology and parameter changes .",
    "conventionally , the jacobian matrix can be constructed based on state estimation results provided that an accurate dynamic model and network parameter values are available @xcite . however , as discussed before , up - to - date network topology and parameters may not be available , so the conventional method may give rise to imprecise estimations .",
    "in contrast , the proposed hybrid method does not depend on the network parameter values , and provides a robust alternative to traditional state estimation - based approaches in situations where uncertainty in parameters and system topology is an issue .",
    "the estimated dynamic state jacobian matrix can be utilized in various applications .",
    "first , it will be shown that the estimated jacobian matrix can facilitate online oscillation analysis and control .",
    "the conventional model - based method for oscillation analysis relies on an accurate power system model and requires exhaustive computational effort @xcite , which is not suitable for online oscillation monitoring .",
    "hence , much attention has been put for measurement - based methods which are deemed to be fast and robust to parameter change . particularly , measurement - based mode shape estimation methods have been proposed by using prony analysis @xcite , spectral methods @xcite@xcite , frequency domain decomposition @xcite , subspace method @xcite@xcite , transfer function method @xcite , etc . unlike these previous studies ,",
    "online oscillation analysis and control technique developed in this paper relies on online estimation of the jacobian matrix .",
    "hence , participation factor of the excited model is achievable , which conversely can not be extracted from the purely measurement - based approaches .",
    "as the participation factor provides relative contribution of each state in the corresponding mode , it can naturally be used for locating oscillation source and designing control actions @xcite .",
    "a numerical example will be presented to show how the estimated jacobian matrix may help online oscillation analysis and control .",
    "a relevant work @xcite applies a formula to damp interarea oscillations by generator re - dispatch based on eigenvalue sensitivity instead of participation factor .",
    "another application of the estimated jacobian matrix is online steady - state stability monitoring and control .",
    "measurement - based approaches for real - time rotor angle and short - term voltage stability monitoring have been explored in many previous works ( e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "regarding steady - state stability , the authors of @xcite@xcite have proposed statistical stability indicators for stochastic power systems based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down . in this paper ,",
    "the proposed stability indicators are based on the online estimate of the jacobian matrix and hence the state matrix .",
    "firstly , the critical eigenvalue ( i.e. the eigenvalue with maximum real part ) of the state matrix can be used as a good measure of proximity to instability @xcite .",
    "in addition to a simple stability indicator , the left and right eigenvectors of the critical eigenvalue can be utilized to predict the response of the system and design emergency control measures @xcite@xcite .",
    "a numerical example will be given to illustrate how the estimated jacobian matrix by the proposed method may contribute to online stability monitoring and control .",
    "apart from the above applications , we believe that the estimated jacobian matrix can also facilitate other emergency decision - making in power system operation such as generation re - dispatch and congestion relief , which requires further investigation .",
    "besides the estimated jacobian matrix , a side - product of the method provides an approach to estimate damping of the synchronous generators .",
    "a numerical example will be given to illustrate this application in model validation .",
