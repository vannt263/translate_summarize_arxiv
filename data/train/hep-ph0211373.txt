    "the search for the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) is one of the major tasks of the next generation of high - energy collider experiments .",
    "the direct limit on the sm higgs boson mass , @xmath0 , from lep2 searches and the indirect limit from electroweak precision data strongly suggest the existence of a light higgs boson , @xmath1  gev ( 95 @xmath2 c.l . )",
    "@xcite , which may be within the reach of the fermilab tevatron @xmath3 collider  @xcite .",
    "however , since the dominant sm higgs production channels are plagued with low event rates and large backgrounds , the higgs boson search at the tevatron requires high luminosity , and all possible production channels should be considered .",
    "the production of a sm higgs boson in association with a top - quark pair , @xmath4 , can play a role for almost the entire tevatron discovery range  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath5 event rate is small , the signature of such events is quite spectacular ( @xmath6 ) .    at the cern lhc",
    "@xmath7 collider , the associated @xmath5 production mode will play a crucial role in the 110  gev@xmath8130  gev mass region both for discovery and for precision measurements of the higgs boson couplings .",
    "this process will provide a direct measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling and will be instrumental in determining ratios of higgs boson couplings in a model independent way  @xcite .",
    "such measurements could help to distinguish a sm higgs boson from more complex higgs sectors , e.g. , as predicted by supersymmetry , and shed light on the details of the generation of fermion masses .",
    "as for any other hadronic cross section , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections are expected to be numerically important and are crucial in reducing the ( arbitrary ) dependence of the cross sections on the factorization and renormalization scales . here we summarize the calculation of the nlo qcd predictions for associated @xmath5 production at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "results for the tevatron have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and for the lhc in refs .",
    "the results of the two groups are in very good agreement within the statistical errors .",
    "the inclusive total cross section for @xmath7 ( or @xmath3 ) @xmath9 at @xmath10 can be written as : @xmath11\\,\\,\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the nlo parton distribution functions for parton @xmath13 in a proton / antiproton , defined at a generic factorization scale @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the @xmath10 parton - level total cross section for incoming partons @xmath13 and @xmath16 , renormalized at an arbitrary scale @xmath17 .",
    "we take @xmath18 .",
    "the nlo parton - level total cross section @xmath15 consists of the @xmath19 born cross section and the @xmath20 corrections to the born cross section , including the effects of mass factorization .",
    "it contains virtual and real corrections to the parton - level @xmath5 production processes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the tree - level @xmath23 initiated processes , @xmath24 , which are of the same order in @xmath25 .",
    "the main challenges in the calculation come from the presence of pentagon diagrams in the virtual corrections with several massive external and internal particles , and from the computation of the real part in the presence of infrared singularities .",
    "the calculation of the virtual corrections to the @xmath26 initiated sub - process is described in detail in ref .",
    "the calculation of the virtual corrections to @xmath22 is technically similar .",
    "the basic method is to reduce each virtual diagram to a sum of scalar integrals , which may contain both ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences .",
    "the finite scalar integrals are evaluated by using the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite and cross checked with the numerical package ff  @xcite .",
    "the scalar integrals that exhibit uv and/or ir divergences are calculated analytically .",
    "both the uv and ir divergences are extracted by using dimensional regularization in @xmath27 dimensions .",
    "the uv divergences are then removed by introducing a suitable set of counterterms , as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite the remaining ir divergences are cancelled by the analogous singularities in the soft and collinear part of the real gluon emission cross section .",
    "the most difficult integrals arise from the ir - divergent pentagon diagrams with several massive particles . in refs .",
    "@xcite we calculated the pentagon scalar integrals as linear combinations of scalar box integrals using the method of ref",
    ".  @xcite . for the @xmath28 initiated process we also used the method of ref .",
    "@xcite and found perfect agreement between the results of the two methods .",
    "the virtual corrections to the @xmath28 initiated process have an additional complication with respect to the @xmath29 case because of the presence of pentagon tensor integrals with rank higher than one .",
    "pentagon tensor integrals can give rise to numerical instabilities due to the dependence on inverse powers of the gram determinant .",
    "the gram determinant vanishes when two momenta become degenerate , i.e. at the boundaries of phase space .",
    "these are spurious divergences , which cause serious numerical difficulties .",
    "we have used two methods to overcome this problem and found mutual agreement within the phase space integration statistical uncertainty :    * impose kinematic cuts to avoid the phase space regions where the gram determinant vanishes .",
    "then apply an extrapolation procedure from the numerically safe to the numerically unsafe region .",
    "* eliminate all pentagon tensor integrals by cancelling terms in the numerator against the propagators wherever possible , after interfering the pentagon amplitude with the born - matrix element .",
    "the resulting expressions are very large , but numerically stable .",
    "the real corrections are computed using the phase space slicing ( pss ) method , in both the double @xcite and single @xcite cutoff approaches . in both approaches the ir region of the @xmath30 phase space where the emitted gluon can not be resolved",
    "is defined as the region where the gluon kinematic invariants : @xmath31 become small . here",
    "@xmath32 is the momentum of an external quark or gluon ( with energy @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the final state gluon momentum with energy @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the angle between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the ir region",
    "the cross section is calculated analytically and the resulting ir divergences , both soft and collinear , are cancelled , after mass factorization , against the corresponding divergences from the @xmath20 virtual corrections .",
    "the single cutoff pss technique defines the ir region as that where @xmath40 for an arbitrarily small cutoff @xmath41 .",
    "the two cut - off pss method introduces two arbitrary parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , to separately define the ir soft and ir collinear regions according to : @xmath44    in both methods , the real contribution to the nlo cross section is computed analytically below the cutoffs and numerically above the cutoffs , and the final result is independent of these arbitrary parameters . with this respect ,",
    "it is crucial to study the behavior of @xmath45 in a region where the cutoff(s ) are small enough to justify the analytical calculations of the ir divergent contributions to the real cross section , but not so small as to cause numerical instabilities .",
    "this is the first application of the single cut - off phase space slicing approach to a cross section involving more than one massive particle in the final state .",
    "the numerical results of both methods agree within the statistical errors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dipole subtraction formalism has been used to extract the ir singularities of the real part .",
    "the agreement between these three very different treatments of the real ir singularities represents a powerful check of the corresponding nlo calculations .     on the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath46 , at the tevatron ( @xmath47  tev ) , for @xmath48 gev  @xcite . ]     on @xmath0 , at @xmath47  tev , for @xmath49  @xcite .",
