    "spreading and survival of populations of bacteria often depend on their ability to behave collectively : cells aggregate into swarms to seek and migrate towards nutrient - rich regions  @xcite , organise into biofilms resistant to antibiotics  @xcite , respond to starvation by building fruiting bodies  @xcite or opt for cannibalism  @xcite .",
    "in such organisations , the surrounding environment often plays a major role , through its chemical composition  @xcite or geometrical constraints  @xcite .",
    "a complex and fascinating issue is how the various chemical or mechanical interactions between the microorganisms and their environment can guide the intricate dynamics of populations .",
    "theoretical approaches to this question may utilize methods from the emerging field of ` active matter ' , which has taken motivation from collective behaviour in suspensions of flagellated bacteria ( e.g. , _ escherichia coli _ and _ bacillus subtilis _ )  @xcite as well as those composed of molecular motors and the filaments along which they move  @xcite . using discrete  @xcite , continuum  @xcite , and phenomenological models ,",
    "this growing field of research has studied self - organisation of populations of interacting motile organisms or other kinds of active and driven objects , often giving rise to striking collective behaviours .",
    "recent studies have predicted that physical confinement can have a strong impact on the spatio - temporal organization , and indeed may result in unidirectional flows  @xcite .",
    "experimental realisations of confined active matter however remain relatively rare  @xcite .",
    "the interactions between swimming cells in bacterial suspensions have two main components : direct steric repulsion and long - range hydrodynamic forces created by the action of multiple flagella .",
    "these interactions lead to complex collective motion : while direct repulsion between rod - like bacteria produces local alignment akin to nematic liquid crystal ordering , hydrodynamic forces can advect and reorient nearby bacteria  @xcite and power macroscopic turbulent patterns such as jets and swirls much faster than an individual bacterium  @xcite . yet , these collective structures are not permanent , instead they are _ recurrent _ and _ transient_.",
    "previous experiments have been successful in controlling the bacterial migration through gradients of chemoattractants  @xcite or by varying external flow and environment properties  @xcite .",
    "an alternative that we consider here takes advantage of interfaces , as can be commonly encountered in bacterial habitats like soil .",
    "recent studies have explained how a single microorganism interacts with surfaces  @xcite , yet little has been done to experimentally study the collective dynamics of motile bacteria and other types of active matter under confinement  @xcite .",
    "different interfaces ( fluid , solid ) or confinement topologies ( e.g. planar , linear , circular ) could lead to various macroscopic organisations .    here",
    "we describe an experimental setup able to stabilise a dense suspension of _ bacillus subtilis _ into a persistent stream through physical confinement alone .",
    "as shown in figure [ setup ] , bacteria are introduced into an array of a thin periodic millimetre - long racetracks , allowing for quantification of many realizations of the resultant flow patterns .",
    "our chief finding is that there exists a clear transition from a ` turbulent ' state to stable circulation for channel widths @xmath0 m , or a scale comparable to correlation length of cell orientations , or equivalently the diameter of the characteristic swirls seen in effectively unbounded suspensions  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of a discrete model of swimmers which incorporates both steric and hydrodynamic interactions between the cells reveal that the suspension motion is dominated by the bacteria - driven fluid stream .",
    "in particular , cells close to the bounding walls create a strong fluid flow which advects the cells in the bulk of the channel against their swimming direction in a manner similar to that seen in circular drops of suspension @xcite .",

    "we found the same qualitative behaviour with strong circulation only for thin channels @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the swimmer length ) .",

    "note that other outcomes , e.g. flow strength , are not necessarily matched .          in unconfined environments , dense bacterial suspensions exhibit typical patterns of jets and swirls  @xcite .",
    "pdms interfaces in racetracks change this pattern in order to allow for the net circulation .",
    "we now study the pattern stabilisation , through the averaged flow profile , depending on the channel width .",

    "we measure the profile or cross section of the flow patterns , averaged over time and space : @xmath75 where the direction of @xmath61 is chosen such that @xmath76 is on average positive .",
    "figure [ profile](a ) shows different behaviours depending on the channel width @xmath67 .    for the thinnest channels ( @xmath77 m ) the flow is directed parallel to the channel length and @xmath78 takes a quasi - parabolic profile . @xmath78",
    "then flattens for @xmath79 m and splits into two peaks for @xmath80 m . at such width , small swirls start to emerge but are not strong enough to alter the circulation . when the width reaches the critical value @xmath81 m , the suspension is able to form full vortices .",
    "@xmath78 takes a sinusoidal form such that bacteria on each side move in opposite directions and most vortices circulate in the same direction ( ccw in figure [ profile ] ( a ) ) . for wider racetrack ( @xmath82 m )",
    "the suspension recovers its quasi - turbulent state and @xmath78 exhibits several oscillations . in this last case ,",
    "if we averaged over a longer period of time , the resulting profile should come to zero .    for channels between @xmath83 and @xmath84 m in width",
    ", we observe that the profile @xmath78 displays two maximum values , at a distance @xmath85 from the pdms interface ( figure [ profile](b ) ) . in order to measure this length for different widths",
    ", we fit @xmath78 with a combination of two symmetric beta distribution functions : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the amplitude of each function and @xmath89 is a parameters setting the shape of the distribution .",
    "each beta function is the symmetric of the other except for the amplitude : @xmath90 .",
    "the beta distribution functions are merely used for simplicity and have no physical connection to the bacterial suspensions .",
    "we found that @xmath91 correctly describes the flow profiles until @xmath92 m ( figure [ profile](a ) ) .",
    "for @xmath77 m , the two beta functions are almost identically and mostly overlap .",
    "they then come apart to form a double - peaked function ( @xmath80 m ) which then becomes anti - correlated ( @xmath93 ) for @xmath92 m . for the largest racetrack , @xmath91 only captures the first and last peaks but not the bulk behaviour .",
    "we then measure the distance @xmath85 at which @xmath94 reaches its maximum ( represented as a thin line on figure [ profile](b ) ) .",
    "figure [ profile](d ) shows that @xmath85 does not depend on the racetrack width : the flow profile is simply the sum of two beta functions , of width - independent shape , and that move apart as the channels widen , suggesting that the circulation is driven by bacteria close to the wall .",
    "simulations show a similar behaviour , with parabolic ( @xmath95 ) , flattened ( @xmath96 ) , double - peaked ( @xmath97 ) and sinusoidal profiles ( @xmath98 , figure [ profile](b ) ) .",
    "the only significant difference lies in the bacteria motion at the boundary : simulations reveal that these swimmers move against the bulk circulation : @xmath99 .",
    "we also observed experimentally that bacteria at interfaces swim against the bulk circulation , but piv measurements could not catch this feature .",
    "both the swimmer motion at the boundary and the flow profile fitting suggest that bacteria close to the wall play an important role in the suspension ordering .",
    "we turn to simulations to understand how boundaries affect the bacteria organisation and in particular to find the causes of the bulk circulation as observed in experiments .",
    "we consider different scenarios : dilute or dense suspensions , with or without hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the examples in figure [ simulations ] have a channel width of @xmath95 .",
    "we first neglect hydrodynamics and consider swimmers interacting between themselves and with the boundary through direct steric repulsions only . in both dilute and dense cases ( figure [ simulations](a),(b ) ) , swimmers aggregate at the boundary to form packs or hedgehog - like clusters , as previously observed  @xcite . due to their elongated shape , swimmers at the boundary exhibit a local nematic alignment , with heads facing the interface , and slowly move alongside it .",
    "cells in the bulk jam in clusters with little organisation discernible .",
    "+    we next include fluid flows generated by bacteria . in dilute suspensions ,",
    "as shown in figure [ simulations](c ) , swimmers aggregate at the boundary and form packed layers similar to the steric - only case .",
    "however they generate a strong fluid stream , against their swimming direction . if the channel width is sufficiently small , the fluid reorients the opposite layer such that swimmers on each channel side move in the same direction .",
    "this packing and organisation is not observed experimentally at low densities , most probably because 2d simulations do not allow for overlap whereas bacteria in @xmath8 m deep racetracks can easily swim and roll - over over one - another .    when the density is further increased ( figure [ simulations](d ) ) , the same mechanism is at work : the two boundary - bound layers of swimmers drive a strong fluid flow , reorienting and advecting the cells that now fill up the centre of the channel .",
    "bulk swimmers have a biased orientation against this flow but do not swim fast enough to overcome the advection .",
    "they are thus transported against the boundary layers giving rise to a macroscopic bulk circulation similar to the experimental observations ( figure [ setup](b ) ) .",
    "the simulations also clarify the profile shapes ( figure [ profile ] ) .",
    "sketches of the swimmers , drawn at the channel walls in figure [ profile](c ) , indicate their swimming orientation and the direction of the fluid flow they push back .",
    "this flow advects over a distance @xmath100 the cells in the bulk , whose overall collective motion can be fitted with the double beta function profiles .",
    "experimentally , bacteria can flow over @xmath101 m/s , significantly faster than the single cell swimming speed of @xmath102 m/s .",
    "this high velocity suggests that the bulk bacterial motion is indeed dominated by fluid advection .    to verify the organisation predicted by simulations , we track fluorescently labelled bacteria ( figure  [ fluo ] ) .",
    "we deduced the cell orientation from the relative position of the body and flagella and the overall motion from the body displacement .",
    "we found the same biased orientation against the flow in the bulk of thin channels ( @xmath103 m ) : out of the @xmath104 labelled bacteria tracked , @xmath105 were oriented along the @xmath106 direction , @xmath105 were swimming with the flow and @xmath107 were swimming against the flow ( oriented against their overall motion direction ) .",
    "cells at the surface had a forward motion , against the bulk circulation , confirming the organisation found in simulations .",
    "our current model - edge bacteria driving the bulk flow through hydrodynamic interactions - explains the overall circulation .",
    "as described earlier , bacteria in thin racetracks also form partial and travelling swirls , reminiscent of the unconfined turbulent state .",
    "we study this flow pattern by computing both the correlation lengths and the motion of swirls .",
    "we first compute the spatial correlation from which we extract two characteristic lengths : the oscillation period @xmath108 and the amplitude decay length @xmath109 . to do so , we take advantage of the lateral confinement and modify the classical two - point velocity correlation function to focus on the variation of the orthogonal flow @xmath110 along the channel length @xmath61 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and taking the sum over piv sub - windows in the bulk of a channel of a full @xmath12 second long movie .",
    "@xmath113 exhibits decaying oscillations ( figure [ graph](b ) ) , a behaviour that was observed in previous work  @xcite but , to our knowledge , has not been fully analysed .",
    "two main approaches have been used to compute the correlation length : either fitting with a decaying exponential  @xcite or taking the distance at which @xmath113 reaches zero or its first minimum  @xcite .",
    "instead we fit @xmath113 with a function that describes the decay and the oscillations : @xmath114 \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi s / l_c),\\ ] ] where the first term indicates the amplitude decaying over the length @xmath109 and the cosine term highlights the oscillation period @xmath108 ( swirl size ) .",
    "figure [ graph](a ) shows that both @xmath109 and @xmath108 increase with the racetrack width and reach a plateau around @xmath115 m .",
    "this size is comparable with @xmath116 m when streaming ceases and the suspension is able to form full vortices . moreover",
    "values at the plateau , @xmath117 m and @xmath118 m , are comparable in large racetracks and unconfined 2d chambers ( noted @xmath119 on the graphs ) .",
    "even though we also do observe a wave pattern in simulations , the correlation function mostly reflects the domain periodicity .",
    "the bacterial flow patterns then are not static : while the bacteria stream in the channel , the partial swirls they generate travel as well . to quantify this effect we measure the flow pattern motion by the spatial correlation between two time points : @xmath120 taking the sum over all piv sub - windows inside the channel and over a full @xmath12 second long movie .",
    "@xmath121 takes a maximum value at @xmath122 which gives a wave speed : @xmath123 .",
    "we compare this speed to the averaged circulation speed @xmath124 , and find that the wave travels slightly faster than the bacteria : median@xmath125 ( standard error : @xmath126 ) . yet",
    ", a more detailed analysis is required to fully understand the dynamics between cell motion and wave propagation in this particular confinement .",
    "we have shown that confining a dense bacterial suspension into a thin periodic racetrack leads to the spontaneous formation of a stable circulation along it .",
    "a similar setup has been previously used to study two different active matter systems : marching locusts  @xcite and rolling colloidal particles  @xcite . as for bacteria ,",
    "collective colloid motion is driven by hydrodynamic interactions , but can result in the formation of travelling waves and density shocks while the bacterial suspension always appears spatially homogeneous .",
    "+ to understand how the suspension self - organises in racetracks , we have measured the net flow , flow correlation and profile depending on the channel width .",
    "we reproduced these results with simulations , revealing the fluid flows generated by the bacteria . combining these different approaches",
    ", we draw a picture in figure [ sketch ] of how bacterial motion , hydrodynamic interactions and confinement drive the macroscopic circulation .    independently of the channel size , bacteria at the pdms surface move along a given direction while propelling the fluid in the opposite direction , over a distance @xmath127 m .",
    "this fluid flow , much faster than the single cell s swimming speed , reorients and advects cells in the suspension . as a result",
    "bulk bacteria are transported against their swimming orientation in a backward motion .",
    "different behaviours then arise for varying channel widths . for thin channels ( @xmath103 m ) the fluid flow on one side reaches the opposite interface and reorients the bacteria such that all cells at the different surfaces move in the opposite direction to the bulk circulation , and give rise to the parabolic , flat and double - peaked profiles ( figure [ sketch ] ) . inside the channel",
    ", confinement restricts the turbulent bacterial motion such that bacteria form partial swirls that mostly travel with the bacterial stream , without affecting the overall circulation . for intermediate channel widths ( @xmath128 m ) the suspension forms full vortices , showing no net circulation ( @xmath69 ) . yet the coordination between opposite sides is not lost but now appears to be anti - correlated ( as shown in the sinusoidal flow profiles , figure [ sketch ] ) . in particular , vortices in the channels have a preferred rotation direction , either clockwise or counterclockwise , depending on the orientation of the bacteria at the interface . for even larger channels , @xmath129 m",
    ", the suspension recovers its unconfined turbulent state and no correlation is observed between opposite pdms walls .",
    "however it still remains unclear how the critical length - scale of @xmath116 m of the vortical macroscopic structures in the collective motion of this bacterium is selected . + some continuum models of active matter in confinement have previously predicted unidirectional flow or net circulation  @xcite .",

    "et al._@xcite considered 2d channels of varying width but observed circulation for channels wider than the suspension vortex size , in contradiction with our net flow measurements ( figure [ circulation ] ) .",
    "neef and kruse  @xcite consider active polar fluids in annular domains and see surprisingly similar patterns to ours such as unidirectional streaming , moving or stationary vortices for increasing channel widths in the extensile particle case .",
    "many of the differences between these theoretical predictions may arise from the difficulty of setting realistic boundary conditions and on including both the swimmer - generated fluid flow and bacterial motion in such continuum models .    despite many previous simulation studies on micro - swimmers in channels or between plates ,",
    "this specific collective behaviour we report here has not been observed before in experiments or simulations .",
    "menzel  @xcite performed simulations of self - propelled particles using a vicsek model with aligning interactions , no hydrodynamics , and observed collective migration along the channel in the form of particle clusters and lanes .",
    "et al._@xcite simulated elongated swimmers in a periodic channel , interacting directly and through dipolar - generated fluid flows , but did not observe any collective behaviour and net circulation when external flow was not imposed .",
    "one possible explanation is that they computed the hydrodynamic interactions without taking into account boundaries .",
    "here we include mirror images to approximate the pdms interface which enhances the bulk fluid stream .",
    "these small differences between these studies highlight the key roles played not only by the surfaces and the cell - driven flows arising from them but also of the elongated particle shapes that are needed for the swimmers orienting and ordering alongside each - other at the wall .    yet ,",
    "the behaviour of bacteria in racetracks is reminiscent of some previous experiments and can be understood as a combination of insights deriving from them .",
    "swimming bacteria glued to a surface can coordinate their orientations and create a net flow far from the wall .",
    "et al._@xcite used this effect to propel small objects while kim _",
    "et al._@xcite used it to turn a microfluidic channel into a bacteria - powered pump .",
    "this phenomenon is qualitatively similar to what we observed in the racetracks , except here the bacteria are free and swimming along the surface while creating fluid flow in the bulk .",
    "other studies have shown that the motion of swimmers in micro - channels is affected by an external shear flow  @xcite .",
    "in particular , swimmers there are biased to swim against the flow as we also observed in simulations and confirmed with fluorescence labelling .",
    "finally , the self - organisation in racetracks is comparable to what was observed when bacteria were confined in flattened drops : the bacteria at the interface move in opposite direction to the bulk , which itself is advected by the fluid  @xcite . in both experiments ( drops and racetracks )",
    ", we found that the net circulation breaks down around @xmath84 m , the typical size of swirls in unconfined chambers  @xcite and also the critical diameter of circular drops below which bacterial motion stabilizes into one vortex  @xcite .",
    "microfluidic channels have been used previously to study the behaviour of micro - swimmers , notably to sort bacteria _",
    "e. coli _ by length  @xcite or direct spermatozoa  @xcite by making use of ratcheting channels .",
    "the curves of the micro - channels in those cases are designed to guide the swimmers in one specified direction .",
    "here we used straight walls , such that the spontaneously emerging stream can occur in either direction with equal probability .",
    "as an extension of our work , one could design a circular channel with ratcheted surfaces to direct the suspension stream in a chosen left or right direction .",
    "dense bacterial suspensions have been extensively studied without confinement and yet their self - organisation presents new challenges and surprises .",
    "the experiments presented here not only give insight into the effect of confinement but also help in understanding the general behaviour of such suspensions .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the correlation function could be analysed as two parts : an oscillating and a decaying term . to our knowledge ,",
    "other studies have described only one of the two , fitting the vortex size or the persistence length . here",
    "confinement into a racetrack stabilises the suspension to form a more regular pattern , emphasising this structure .",
    "with the added insight of our work , some previous results could be reinterpreted : for example , gachelin _",
