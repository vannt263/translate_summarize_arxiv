    "three - body models are useful to describe the relative wave function of three particles when their intrinsic structure remains unchanged @xcite . the intrinsic and the relative degrees of freedom",
    "are then assumed to be completely decoupled . however , when the particles themselves are composite structures ( clusters ) and contain identical fermions this assumption violates the pauli principle related to fermions distributed in different clusters .",
    "this violation typically leads to unphysical deeply bound two - cluster states . in the two - body problem",
    "this violation can be easily cured by removing this unphysical state from the active space available for the system .    in the three - cluster problem",
    "most of the usual approaches to include the pauli principle basically fall into two categories : i ) to project out the undesired overlap of the three - body wave function with the pauli forbidden two - body state@xcite and ii ) to modify the two - body interaction in such a way that the unphysical bound cluster - cluster state is avoided , provided the low energy scattering properties @xcite or the phase shifts @xcite remain unchanged .",
    "the prescriptions basically amount to either excluding occupation of pauli forbidden two - body states in the three - body wave function or excluding the apriori appearance of such undesired states .",
    "the two prescriptions give somewhat different results and it is not yet clear which one is preferable . the projection technique , although seems to be more straightforward , is in practice technically more difficult .",
    "the problem of treating the intercluster pauli principle again attracted attention in investigations of the structure of the three - body halo nuclei @xcite where most of the information is obtained by studying momentum distributions of fragments of these nuclei in fast collisions with light targets .",

    "this is still true although more elaborate analyses are required .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first we describe how the projecting out technique can be easily incorporated in the adiabatic hyperspherical expansion of the faddeev equations in coordinate space  @xcite . this method to solve the faddeev equations",
    "has already been used in several investigations of halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "secondly we investigate how the differences in the prescriptions are reflected in the momentum distributions of fragments from the break - up reactions of three - body halos .",
    "this question is important for an unambiguous interpretation of the wealth of experimental data on three - body halos like @xmath0he ( @xmath2he+n+n ) and @xmath1li ( @xmath3li+n+n ) .",
    "after the introduction we shall in section 2 describe the method and compare potentials and wave functions for two different prescriptions . in section 3",

    "the first row corresponds to a computation with a shallow s - wave potential without bound states while the second and third rows correspond to computations with deep s - wave potentials with one bound state .",
    "the effective range and scattering length are the same in the three cases and the s - wave interaction places the lowest virtual s - state at 200 kev . once the s - wave potential has been fixed the energy of the @xmath57-resonance must then be around 1.7 mev for the shallow potential case in order to fit the @xmath1li binding energy .",
    "when the deep potential is used we consider two situations .",
    "first we keep the energy of the @xmath58-resonance unchanged .",
    "then the @xmath57-energy is reduced to 0.8 mev in order to recover the @xmath1li binding energy . in the second case",
    "we force the @xmath57-resonance energy to take the same value as for the shallow potential .",
    "the correct @xmath1li binding energy is in this case obtained by reducing the energy of the @xmath58-resonance .",
    "the cases 1 and 2 correspond to the parameters given in section 3 and they will be the two cases considered for @xmath1li in the next figures ( more elaborated and detailed computations for @xmath1li fragmentation reactions may be found elsewhere , see @xcite ) .    .",
    "key quantities for @xmath124he corresponding to various neutron - core interactions which are chosen as gaussians in each partial wave .",
    "the neutron - neutron interaction is given in section 3 .",
    "for the neutron-@xmath2he subsystem we give energies of the virtual @xmath125-state , s - wave scattering lengths , energies and widths of the @xmath57-resonance .",
    "the @xmath58-resonance energy and width are in all cases 0.77 mev and 0.73 mev , respectively .",
    "the full width at half maximum for core and neutron momentum distributions is denoted @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we also give the probability for finding the neutron-@xmath128he subsystem in a @xmath129-wave in the three - body wave function of @xmath124he .",
    "the remaining probablity is found in s - waves .",
    "the total binding energy of the three - body system is in all cases equal to about 1.0 mev and the root mean square radius is given in the last column .",

    "[ 6 ] we show the computed longitudinal core momentum distributions after neutron removal in a fast nuclear break - up reaction of @xmath1li on a light target .",
    "we assume that the @xmath80li - core has spin zero .",
    "the model is then without the proper spin couplings and the spin splitting of the neutron - core relative states @xcite .",
    "although simplified the model is still not far from being realistic .",
    "the two prescriptions again give very similar results and the effect of the final state interaction is now a little smaller than for @xmath124he due to the larger mass of the core nucleus .",
    "the experimental distributions are essentially reproduced , and correspond to a @xmath1li fragmentation reaction on al at 468 mev / u and 648 mev / u @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ 7a ] and [ 7b ] we show computed longitudinal and radial ( @xmath130 ) neutron momentum distributions for a neutron removal reaction of @xmath1li .",
    "the cases shown in the figure correspond to rows 1 and 2 of table ii .",
    "the difference in energy of the @xmath57 resonance in the neutron - core subsystem produces the difference in the momentum distribution when the final state interaction is included .",
    "in fact the momentum distributions obtained in the third case of table ii are almost indistinguishable from those obtained in the first case ( the energy of the @xmath57 resonance is the same in these two cases ) .",
    "the final state interaction is then important due to the presence of low lying virtual s - states and p - resonances , and very sensitive to the energies of these low lying states .    for completeness",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ 8a ] and [ 8b ] the longitudinal and radial neutron momentum distribution from a @xmath1li core break - up reaction .",
    "we again observe an important effect produced by the inclusion of the final neutron - neutron interaction ( the neutron - neutron interaction has a low lying virtual s - state ) , and an almost identical result for both the shallow and deep neutron-@xmath3li s - wave potential . in figs .",
    "[ 7b ] and [ 8b ] the experimental data are fairly well reproduced , and correspond to a @xmath1li fragmentation reaction at 280 mev / u on a carbon target @xcite    [ [ invariant - mass - spectrum . ] ] invariant mass spectrum .",

    "the energy of a resonance is defined as the @xmath134 value for which the cross section has a maximum . as a consequence",
    "the invariant mass spectrum ( [ invsp ] ) will show a peak at the @xmath112 energy equal to a resonance energy .    in fig .",
    "[ 9 ] we show the invariant mass spectrum ( [ invsp ] ) from a @xmath0he neutron removal reaction .",
    "the cases with repulsive s - potential ( solid line ) and attractive s - potential with a pauli forbidden state ( short - dashed line ) are shown .",
    "the parameters correspond to cases 1 and 7 in table i , respectively .",
    "as seen from the figure , both curves are very similar , and show a peak around @xmath135 mev , that corresponds to the energy of the @xmath58 resonance",
    ". another p - resonance is present at 2 mev in @xmath95he .",
    "however its width is much larger than before , and therefore its effect on the spectrum is much more spreaded out . to illustrate how the invariant mass spectrum is sensitive to the resonance energies we also show the case where the neutron-@xmath2he potential introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is used ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "the suggested increase by 3% of the range of the neutron-@xmath2he potential makes the energy of the @xmath58 resonance too small ( around 0.3 mev ) , giving rise to the pronounced peak in the invariant mass spectrum at that energy .",
    "the different height of the curves in fig .",
    "[ 9 ] comes from the fact that all the three curves are normalized to 1 .    in fig .",
    "[ 10 ] we show the same spectrum as in fig . [ 9 ] from a neutron removal @xmath1li reaction .",
    "the cases of the shallow and deep potentials are shown ( cases 1 and 2 in table ii ) .",
    "the difference between these two cases comes from the different energy of the lowest p - resonance .    for the deep potential ( dashed line ) the @xmath57 resonance is at 0.77 mev , creating a clear shoulder in the curve at that energy .",
    "note that the contribution to the wave function from the p - wave ( 21% probability ) is given directly by the schematic model .",
    "it is determined by the energies of the virtual @xmath125 state and the @xmath57 resonance together with the requirement of fitting the binding energy and radius of @xmath1li .",
    "therefore the shoulder in the distribution is less pronounced than in calculations where the p - wave content is chosen to be higher , for instance in @xcite , where a rather arbitrary 50% contribution for the p - waves is chosen . for the shallow potential ( solid curve )",
    "the large width of the resonance at 1.7 mev broadens the corresponding peak at that energy and it disappears completely . for both the deep and the shallow potential",
    "the lowest peak comes from the low lying virtual s - state in @xmath97li .",
    "however in this case the position of the peak is not directly related to the energy of the virtual state .",
    "a virtual state produces an increase    of the momentum distributions at zero momentum .",
    "in fact , the value of the invariant mass spectrum divided by @xmath136 is not zero at zero energy , and the lower the virtual s - state the larger the value at the origin . in the inset of fig . [",
    "10 ] we show the deep potential case where we have separated the contributions from the s and the p - waves .",
    "it is then clear how the s - wave is responsible for the first peak , while the shoulder is produced by the @xmath57 resonance at 0.77 mev .",
    "the experimental points @xcite correspond to a @xmath1li fragmentation process on carbon .",
    "a better agreement between the computed curves and the experimental data is possible when the spin of the core is taken into account in the description of @xmath1li and @xmath97li .",
    "we study two prescriptions to take the pauli principle into account in the three - body cluster model where more than one cluster contain nucleons .",
    "one is to exclude the pauli forbidden two - body state from the active space available for the three - body system , the other is to construct a two - body potential without the pauli forbidden state but with the same low energy properties .",
    "we solve the faddeev equations in coordinate space by means of the adiabatic hyperspherical expansion .",
    "we calculate the angular eigenvalues of the faddeev equations which are closely related to the effective radial potentials .",
    "this spectrum is computed for the two different potentials with identical low energy properties and either without or with one pauli forbidden bound s - state .",
    "each bound state gives rise to a specifically behaving angular eigenvalue .",
    "the technically inexpensive prescription to account for the pauli principle is then simply to omit the angular eigenvalue which corresponds to the pauli forbidden bound state in the calculations of the three - body radial wave functions .",
    "we apply these prescriptions to analyses of the high energy fragmentation reactions of two halo nuclei @xmath0he and @xmath1li within a three - body neutron+neutron+core model .",
    "the potentials of the two prescriptions are adjusted to reproduce the same s- and p - wave low energy data .    for @xmath0he",
    "these data are known experimentally and the interactions are therefore fixed .",
    "the potential with forbidden state then gives correct binding energy and root mean sqare radius for @xmath0he .",
    "the equivalent potential without a bound state slightly underbinds the system . a small reduction of the repulsive core is needed to obtain the correct binding .",
    "this automatically provides almost the same reasonable root mean square radius .",
    "after this small adjustment the wave functions for the two nuclei for the two types of potential are compared and found remarkably similar .    for @xmath1li",
    "we use the currently accepted experimentla data for the lowest s- and p- levels in the neutron core subsystem to adjust the neutron core potentials . with these levels being close to experimental data the deep potentials provide reasonable binding energy and root mean square radius .",
    "the equivalent potential without a bound state slightly overbinds the system . after a small attenuation of the position of the neutron core @xmath58 level",
    "this prescription also provides the correct binding and size of the system .",
    "in general the two prescriptions without any fine tuning provide very close but still distinguishable ground state properties of the three - body system .",
    "after small adjustments the properties become remarkably similar .",
    "we then compute neutron and core momentum distributions in nuclear break - up reactions of these halo nuclei .",
    "we use the sudden approximation and include final state interactions , which are crucial for the neutron distributions as the full width at half maximum for the neutrons from @xmath0he is reduced by a factor of more than 2 from the value corresponding to omitting the final state interaction .",
    "the two prescriptions give almost identical results and the measured momentum distributions are rather accurately reproduced .",
    "these computations are carried out in a consistent model where the same two - body potential is used both for the initial three - body halo structure and for the final state interaction after the break - up process .",
    "the final state invariant mass spectra for @xmath95he and @xmath97li are computed and their features discussed . a virtual s - state shows up as a pronounced peak close to zero energy .",
    "this peak arises from the phase espace factor which vanishes at zero energy , and its position is unrelated with the energy of the virtual state .",
    "higher angular momenta show up as distinct peaks at the resonance energy .",
    "these spectra are then sensitive to the continuum structure of the two - body system .    in conclusion the two prescriptions to account for the pauli principle work remarkably well for the two test examples @xmath0he and @xmath1li . in both cases the lowest pauli forbidden s - state is occupied by nucleons in the core nucleus . however , the valence neutrons occupy predominantly neutron - core relative p - states and s - states , respectively for @xmath0he and @xmath1li .",
    "the wave functions are further tested in connection with our fragmentation model and the measured momentum distributions are nicely reproduced . for @xmath0he",
    "these quantities are computed for the first time whereas @xmath1li was investigated earlier in a more sophisticated model .",
    "although fairly realistic , we used here only a schematic model , because the main purpose was to demonstrate the reliability to account for the pauli pinciple . in any case",
    "the results provide additional support both for the prescriptions and for the fragmentation model .",
