    "the study of the stability of the relative equilibria is very important in the analysis of hamiltonian systems . in the last few decades",
    "some general methods have been developed to tackle this problem , namely the _ energy - casimir method _ and the _ energy momentum method_. the energy - casimir method is an adaptation of the classical lagrange - dirichlet method @xcite that was developed by arnold @xcite and applied to analyze the stability of stationary flows of perfect fluids .",
    "such method was also applied to a variety of other problems .",
    "however this technique relies heavily on a supply of casimir functions .",
    "the energy - momentum method was developed to overcome this difficulty , it is very powerful and was applied successfully to many problems .",
    "unfortunately there are several problems that can not be tackled using the energy momentum method . indeed in some cases",
    "the second variation of the energy is indeterminate .",
    "in particular it is known that in celestial mechanics the stability of the relative equilibria can not be studied using the energy momentum method .",
    "however one can study the linear or spectral stability .",
    "the actual stability of relative equilibria is a major open problem in celestial mechanics .",
    "several authors ( see for example @xcite ) think that all the relative equilibria are nonlinearly unstable because arnold s diffusion is believed to be a feature of the @xmath1-body problem .",
    "remarkably it is very difficult to study arnold s diffusion numerically and the existence of arnold s diffusion in the @xmath1-body problem has not been proved beyond doubt .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of @xmath1 bodies interacting by means of homogeneous and quasihomogeneous potentials . in the case",
    "the potential is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath0 we find that any relative equilibrium is unstable if @xmath2 . in the case of quasihomogeneous potentials we find a similar , but more complex condition .",
    "then we study the equilateral triangle relative equilibria and their stability .",
    "the energy - momentum method fails to provide informations concerning the stability of the relative equilibria since the second variation of the amended potential is indefinite .",
    "therefore we study the linear stability of those solutions .",
    "the linear stability of the lagrangian triangle solution of the newtonian three body problem was first studied by gascheau in 1843 @xcite .",
    "later routh @xcite studied the linear stability of the same solutions in the case of homogeneous potentials .",
    "he proved that linear stability is achieved only when @xmath3 and the masses satisfy < ( ) ^2 [ routhinequality0 ] where the potential is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath0 with @xmath4 . in this work , using a considerably simpler derivation based on an idea of moeckel ( see @xcite ) , we recover the classical result of gascheau and routh ( for spectral stability ) , and we analyze it . in particular we find that the equilateral triangle relative equilibria can be spectrally stable for @xmath5 if one of the masses is much larger than the other two .",
    "an interesting feature appears when @xmath6 , indeed , in this interval , there is spectral stability not only in presence of a dominant mass but also when one of the masses is sufficiently small .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result that stresses the difference between the newtonian potential and other homogeneous potentials .",
    "indeed it is widely believed that , in the newtonian case , as moeckel conjectured @xcite , a relative equilibrium can be linearly stable only if it contains a mass significantly larger than the other masses .",
    "then we use similar methods to generalize routh condition to the case of quasihomogeneous potentials .",
    "quasihomogeneous potentials ( @xcite ) have been widely studied in recent years since they are suitable to describe a number of phenomena . among the other",
    "we recall some of the most representative : the so called manev ( see @xcite and references therein ) and schwarzschild ( see @xcite ) potentials . the manev potential and the schwarzschild potentials are particularly interesting because , under suitable conditions , they describe the motion of a test particle in a gravitational field . in particular it was shown that the manev potential can describe the precession of the perihelion of mercury with the same accuracy as general relativity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the schwarzschild potential can also be used for similar calculations ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "the lennard - jones potential ( @xcite ) is also a very interesting potential used in molecular dynamics to simulate many particle systems as for example solids , liquids and gases .",
    "the relative equilibria for this potential were studied in @xcite and will not be considered here .    in the case of quasihomogeneous potentials we find that spectral stability",
    "is achieved only when @xmath7 and ( ) ^2 [ generalrouthinequality0 ] where @xmath8 is the mutual distance between any two bodies and the potential is the sum of a homogeneous function of degree @xmath0 and of one of degree @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "we denote with @xmath11 the left hand side of inequality ( [ generalrouthinequality0 ] ) .    analyzing the conditions",
    "above we find that , for certain values of the masses , the stability of the lagrangian triangle solutions depend on the size of the triangle .",
    "in particular we show that if @xmath12 the triangle solutions are unstable for any value of the masses . if @xmath13 the above solutions are unstable when @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] and when @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath16 ( for some @xmath17 ) .",
    "moreover they are spectrally stable when @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath18 . if @xmath19 there are three different cases depending on the value of the masses .",
    "when @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] the solutions are unstable , while when @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] they are spectrally stable .",
    "^ 2<f\\leq 1/3[(b-2)/(b+2)]^2 $ ] they are unstable for @xmath22 , but spectrally stable for @xmath23 for some @xmath24 .",
    "the study of the stability of relative equilibria for quasihomogeneous potentials is quite interesting .",
    "indeed the trojan asteroids are found at the lagrangian point of the sun - jupiter system . the gravitational interaction is usually considered to be the newtonian one in most of the studies concerning the trojans .",
    "however if one wants to consider the problem in the framework of general relativity ( see @xcite for a study of the three - body problem in the post - newtonian approximation of general relativity ) then one might get some surprising results . since the schwarzschild and",
    "the manev potentials are used to approximate general relativity the results presented in this paper suggest that it might be impossible to find , in nature , equilateral triangle relative equilibria smaller than a certain size .",
    "this is because the relative equilibria studied in this work ( in the case of quasihomogeneous potentials ) are unstable if the interacting bodies are too close to each others .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we write the equation of motion in cartesian coordinates and in uniformly rotating coordinates .",
    "we define the relative equilibria for the @xmath1-body problem and we formulate the conditions for their spectral stability . in section 3",
    "we study the case of homogeneous potentials .",
    "first we consider the @xmath1-body problem in general and then for @xmath25 we recover the inequality of routh to describe the stability of the lagrange triangle relative equilibria . in the last section we consider quasihomogeneous potentials .",
    "we first study the @xmath1-body problem and then we find a condition for the spectral stability of the lagrange triangle solutions and we discuss it .",
    "we let the mass and position of the @xmath1 bodies be given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 .",
    "newton s equations for the @xmath30th body are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the potential function .",
    "we let the momentum of each body be @xmath33 and let @xmath34 .",

    "this can be viewed as the condition for a critical point of the restriction of the potential to @xmath57 for any constant @xmath58 , where @xmath59 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier .    in the following",
    "we will consider the potential @xmath60 to be either a homogeneous potential of the form v(q)=_i < j [ homa ] and w(q)=_i < j , [ homb ] where @xmath61 , or a quasihomogeneous potential defined as a sum of the homogeneous potentials above : u(q)=v(q)+w(q ) .",

    "consequently , to obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath71 , one needs only take the determinant of @xmath79 and find the roots , namely @xmath80 .",
    "following moeckel we introduce the normalized eigenvalues @xmath81 .",
