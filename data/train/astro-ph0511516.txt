    "the tailed x - ray source lies in a 15 ks  observation of a3627 ( obsid 4956 ) , performed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on june 14 - 15 , 2004 .",
    "no background flares were detected .",

    "thus ,  is a very blue galaxy .",
    "spectroscopic studies ( woudt , kraan - korteweg & fairall 1999 ; woudt et al .",
    "2004 ) revealed emission lines of h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , [ oiii ] 5007 and [ nii ] 6584 in the spectrum of .",
    "thus , we conclude that is a late - type galaxy with active star formation .      to better quantify the properties of the tail , we measured  surface brightness profiles along and across it ( fig .",
    "1e and f ) .",
    "the surface brightness has been corrected for background ( from the blank sky background ) and exposure .",

    "if we fit the profile across the tail with a gaussian plus the local background , the derived full width half maximum ( fwhm ) is only 15.2@xmath24@xmath14 .",
    "thus , this feature is very narrow with a length - to - width ratio of @xmath0 10 .    integrated  and  spectra of the source were extracted from a box region centered on the source ( 3.7@xmath25 for  and 4.1@xmath26 for ) .",
    "we were forced to use a larger extraction region for  as the width of the tail is comparable to the half power diameter of the  mirror ( 15@xmath14 ) .",
    "background was taken from surrounding regions , a 4.5@xmath27 box for  and 5@xmath28 box for , excluding the source region . within the source region , 230@xmath924 ( point sources excluded ) ,",
    "967@xmath995 and 872@xmath9103 net counts in the 0.5 - 2 kev band are collected from the acis , pn and mos instruments respectively .",
    "the current data do not allow us to constrain the absorption .",
    "as the spectra are well fitted with galactic absorption at low energies , we fixed the absorption at the galactic value , 2@xmath2910@xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the solar photospheric abundance table by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) is adopted .",
    "a lower energy cut of 0.5 kev is used to minimize the calibration uncertainties at low energies .",
    "the upper energy cut is 7 kev .",
    "each spectrum is fitted to the mekal model .",
    "the abundance is very low but the gas temperature is not sensitive to abundance ( e.g. , t=0.66@xmath90.06 if z=1 solar ) .",
    "all spectra showed evidence for a hard x - ray excess so a power law component was included .",
    "inclusion of the hard component lowers the gas temperature by 10% - 20% , but greatly improves the fit .",
    "the nature of this hard x - ray component is unclear .",
    "the expected unresolved agn contribution is small .",
    "there may be some residual emission from the hot icm , either mixed in the tail or due to the uncertain normalization of the background .",
    "emission of unresolved x - ray binaries in the tail ( see @xmath323.2 ) is another possibility .",
    "regardless of the model used for the hard component , hot icm ( mekal ) , x - ray binaries , or agn ( power law ) , the results for gas properties are almost the same .",
    "the  and  results are consistent so we fit them simultaneously .",
    "the gas temperature is @xmath0 0.7 kev ( table 1 ) .",
    "we also derived temperatures in two regions , head and trail , defined in fig .",
    "the trail is only marginally hotter ( 1 @xmath15 ) than the head .",
    "there are some discrepancies between the derived  and  luminosities , at the level of 20% - 33% , which may be due to uncertainties on the background normalization ( especially for , where the background is higher ) .",
    "the x - ray gas mass in the tail is estimated by assuming a 25@xmath33 cylinder for the head and a 2.6@xmath16 long cylinder for the trail with constant density . from the normalization derived from the mekal",
    "fits , the average electron densities in the head and the trail are 1.8 - 3.5 @xmath34 f@xmath35 @xmath36 and 0.7 - 1.7 @xmath34 f@xmath35 @xmath36 respectively , while the x - ray gas mass is 0.7 - 1.3 @xmath37 f@xmath38 m@xmath6 and 0.6 - 1.5 @xmath37 f@xmath38 m@xmath6 respectively , where f is the filling factor of the x - ray gas . if the abundance in head is 0.3 solar ( the value in the trail within 1 @xmath15 ) , the average electron density and the x - ray gas mass of the head drop by 40% .",
    "the filling factor may be large if the observed tail is really due to mixing of cold clouds and hot icm ( see @xmath324 ) .",
    "since the galaxy and cluster radial velocity are nearly the same , the projected length of the tail may be comparable to the actual length .",
    "thus , the total x - ray gas mass is on the order of 10@xmath39 m@xmath6 .",
    "the temperature of the surrounding icm ( a 3@xmath40 box , excluding the tailed source ) is also measured .",
    "since a3627 is behind the galactic plane , the galactic soft x - ray foreground is strong .",
    "this is proved from the 3 - 5 times higher than nominal flux in the r4-r5 band of the rass image at the position of a3627 .",
    "as there is no local background available , we used the blank - sky background and added a 0.2 kev mekal component ( unabsorbed ) to mimic the soft x - ray excess .",
    "the derived icm temperature is 6.3@xmath41 kev ( table 1 ) .",
    "the error from the uncertainty on the temperature of the soft excess is included , as we allow it to vary from 0.1 to 0.4 kev ( markevitch et al .",
    "the icm electron density from the  data ( bhringer et al . 1996 ) is @xmath0 1.4@xmath42 @xmath36 at the projected position of . within uncertainties ,",
    "the thermal pressure is the same inside and outside the tail , especially if the abundance is not that low .",
    "there are three  point sources right on the axis of the tail ( p1 - p3 in fig .",
    "1 ) , with a total of 73 counts in the 0.5 - 10 kev band .",
    "their combined spectrum is hard ( table .",
    "1 ) . within 3@xmath16 of ,",
    "only an additional , fainter point source is detected .",
    "the possibility of having three background agn aligned in the narrow tail for this shallow observation is @xmath0 0.03% , based on the agn number density derived from three  pointings of a3627 . if p1-p3 are located in the tail , l@xmath43 = 2.7 @xmath44 ergs s@xmath3 ( the total ) , which is similar to the total l@xmath45 of three ulxs in ugc  6697 ( sv05 ) .",
    "since the icm pressure can not move stars , the most likely scenario is that there is active massive star formation in the tail , as the stripped clouds , away from their main heating source ( the stellar uv radiation ) , can cool .",
    "h@xmath21 imaging and hi data are required to test this hypothesis .",
    "the x - ray tail of  is unique .",
    "our systematic study covers a sky area of 3.1 deg@xmath46 in 25 nearby hot clusters , but only ugc  6697 in a1367 has a similar tail as .",
    "however , ugc  6697 is 8 times more luminous than  in the ks band and its tail does not extend significantly outside of the galaxy ( sv05 ) .",
    "even the stripped x - ray tails known in cool clusters and groups ( e.g. , machacek et al .",
    "2005 ) are not as dramatic as the tail of .",
    "the x - ray tail of  is only the third known x - ray tail of a late - type galaxy in hot clusters ( after wang et al .",
    "2004 and sv05 ) .",
    "while its proximity enables further detailed studies , the tail length and the x - ray point sources in the tail provide additional insights .",
    "long and narrow x - ray tails have been seen in the simulation by stevens , acreman & ponman ( 1999 ) , when the stripping happens gradually and gas is replenished in the galaxy .",
    "similar hi tails also were shown in other simulations ( e.g. , quilis et al .",
    "2000 ; vollmer et al .",
    "two 75 kpc h@xmath21 trails have been detected behind two small late - type galaxies in a1367 ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2001 ) , but no x - ray tails are seen in the  data .",
    "a 110 kpc but tilted hi tail was observed from ngc  4388 in virgo ( oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 ) .",
    "the tail of  can not be the accretion wake of , as the galaxy is too small and the icm is too hot .",
    "the  tail can either be the stripped x - ray gas of , or the cold material of  ( e.g. , hi gas ) mixed with hot icm .",
    "the first scenario requires that the stripped tenuous x - ray gas survives all kinds of instabilities and yet remains distinct from the surrounding icm for @xmath47 yr , which is about the time needed for  to travel from the end of the tail to its current position ( 71 kpc in projection ) with a velocity of 1000 km  s@xmath3 ( the cluster radial velocity dispersion is 897 km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "mixing of cold ism with hot icm is preferred , as it is expected after stripping of cold ism .",
    "the average temperature after mixing ( @xmath0 0.7 kev ) is : ( m@xmath48t@xmath48+m@xmath49t@xmath49)/(m@xmath48+m@xmath49 ) , which gives m@xmath49 / m@xmath50 8 for t@xmath48=6.3 kev .",
    "thus , the cold ism dominates the mass but resides in a much smaller volume than the hot icm before the mixing , if pressure equilibrium is assumed .",
    "the evaporation rate of the x - ray tail by the hot icm is unconstrained within the uncertainties , especially if the mixing is still replenishing the @xmath0 0.7 kev x - ray tail .",
    "as  is not a massive galaxy , it should not be hard to remove its gas . according to the approximate criterion for ram pressure stripping by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) , at a velocity of @xmath0 800 km  s@xmath3 , ism with a density of 1 @xmath36",
    "can be removed , if n@xmath51 @xmath36 . from the approximation by mori & burkert ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the stripping process may take @xmath52 yr , if the ism density is @xmath8 1 @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the timescale is long enough to explain the length of the observed tail , and short enough to explain the rarity of such long x - ray tails in late - type galaxies . as there may still be un - mixed cold gas in the tail and galaxy ,  must have been a very gas - rich galaxy , with a gas fraction of @xmath53 0.1 .",
    "the star formation rate in  should be high from its very blue color and emission - line spectrum .",
    "therefore ,  resembles blue dwarf galaxies in z@xmath00.4 clusters that are responsible for the butcher & oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 ) .",
    "as there are no other bright cluster galaxies within 7@xmath16 in the tail direction , the star formation in  is likely triggered by the icm pressure ( e.g. , vollmer et al . 2001 ; sv05 ) .",
    "thus , , in its first passage through the cluster core , is being converted into a gas - poor galaxy ( likely an e+a galaxy ) after a possible initial starburst , all by the interaction with the dense icm .",
    "tails like that of  may provide constraints on the turbulent velocity field in clusters .",
    "the icm has long been suspected to be turbulent , although evidence is sparse .",
    "turbulence eddies on scales of 20 - 90 kpc have been reported in the coma cluster by schuecker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who concluded that @xmath8 10% of total icm pressure is in turbulent form .",
    "dolag et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used a novel approach to treat the icm viscosity and found that turbulent energy is up to 8% of the thermal energy ( on a scale of 70 kpc ) .",
    "if we assume that 15% of the icm pressure is turbulent around , the icm velocity dispersion is @xmath0 435 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "each part of the tail is subject to turbulent pressure in random directions , which is 2r@xmath54v@xmath55 per unit length , where r is the radius of the tail cylinder ( @xmath0 4 kpc ) and v@xmath56 is the turbulent velocity .",
    "this pressure induces an acceleration a=2@xmath54v@xmath55/@xmath57r@xmath58 at random directions for different parts of the tail .",
    "an eddy on scale of r lasts for a time of @xmath0 r / v@xmath56 , which is @xmath53 10@xmath59 yr for r @xmath8 20 kpc .",
    "this implies that large eddies last longer than the current age of the tail .",
    "the displacement of a part of the tail , over a time interval of @xmath60 is then : @xmath61 .",
    "the tail is straight and narrow from the end to the head so we set an upper limit of 10@xmath14 on the displacement . assuming thermal pressure equilibrium between the icm and the x - ray tail ( or @xmath58/@xmath54=9 from the temperature ratio ) , we have v@xmath62 380 km  s@xmath3 ( t/0.05 gyr)@xmath3 on scales from 20 kpc to the length of the tail ( or 70 kpc ) .",
    "this upper limit is still consistent with the lower limit from schuecker et al .",
    ", especially if  moves very fast .",
    "turbulence can also be generated as the gas - rich  moves through the icm .",
    "however , the reynold number is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the mach number , @xmath65 is the size of the galaxy and @xmath66 is the mean free path of ions in the icm . for unmagnetized gas , @xmath67 10 kpc @xmath0 l.",
    "thus , unless magnetic field has reduced @xmath66 by @xmath8 10 times , the motion of  can not drive turbulence in the trail .",
