    "correlations are ubiquitous in nature and have been playing an important role in human life for a long time . for instance , in economy correlations between price and demand are extremely important for a businessman ( or even for a government ) to decide his investment policy . in the field of biology ,",
    "the genetic correlations are fundamental to follow individual traits .",
    "the relationship between income distribution and crime rate is just one example coming from the social sciences . broadly speaking ,",
    "correlation is a quantity that describes the degree of relationship between two variables . in the classical domain",
    ", such a quantity can be measured within the framework of information theory , developed by shannon in 1948 @xcite .",
    "let us consider first the classical scenario with two distinct random variables , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with well defined probability distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we can think of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of probability sets for the outcome of measurements performed on the joint system or on the two different subsystems , usually named _",
    "alice _ and",
    "_ bob_. to say that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are correlated in some form means that the joint probability distribution @xmath4 can not be written in the product form @xmath5 . to quantify the amount of correlations shared by the two classical random variables",
    ", shannon introduced the mutual information @xcite : @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the well - known shannon entropy . here and throughout this article",
    "we use the short - hand notation @xmath8 , in which the random variable @xmath9 assumes the value @xmath10 from the set @xmath11 , and we use @xmath12 to represent the binary logarithm .",
    "so , the correlations are quantified in bits .    in this article",
    "we are interested in a very special kind of correlation , the ones arising from the superposition principle underlying quantum mechanics , known as _ non - classical _ ( or quantum ) correlations .",
    "as we shall see , this is a very intricate issue for which we do not have a closed theory yet .",
    "first we observe that the simplicity and generality of eq .",
    "( [ minformation ] ) allows its direct extension to the quantum domain as a measure of the total correlations in a bipartite system , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the von neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix of partition @xmath9 , @xmath15 , is obtained from the entire density operator by means of the partial trace operation @xmath16 .",
    "however , differently from the classical scenario , here we face the problem of distinguishing between the various types of correlations .",
    "as we shall see below , such problem does not have a clear - cut solution hitherto .",
    "since the early years of quantum mechanics , _ non - local _ correlations have been at the core of a long standing debate about the foundations of the theory .",
    "we may say that the discussion started in 1935 , when einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) published their famous article entitled _  can quantum - mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete ? _",
    "they considered two spatially separated particles , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , having both perfectly correlated positions and momenta . by defining a complete theory as the one for which there is one element of physical reality corresponding to each element of the theory and assuming _ local realism _",
    ", i.e. , shortly    * _ locality _ - there is no action at a distance ; * _ realism _ -  if , without disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity . ;    they argued that quantum mechanics would not be complete ( see @xcite for a recent review about the epr paradox ) . in a sense",
    ", epr implied that quantum mechanics should be extended , possibly through the introduction of hidden variables , making the new theory compatible with their premise of local realism stated above .",
    "in other words , epr demonstrated an inconsistency between local realism and the completeness of quantum mechanics .",
    "schrdinger noted that at the core of the paradox lies the very structure of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that the state vector of the entire system ( including both particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) is _ entangled_.",
    "this means that we can not ascribe an individual state vector for each particle separately , only the entire system can have such a mathematical representation .",
    "this fact leads to the definition of entanglement .",
    "a pure state is separable if and only if it can be written in the product form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the state vector describing the system @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) alone .",
    "otherwise it is entangled .",
    "the argument of schrdinger against epr was that this entanglement is degraded during the process by which @xmath0 and @xmath1 become spatially separated @xcite , leading to the impossibility of physically realizing the _ gedankenexperiment _ proposed by epr .",
    "although interesting , this argument does not settle the paradox .",
    "since then , entanglement has been at the core of the discussion about the non - local aspects of quantum theory , both in respect to its fundamental aspects as well as for ( more recently ) technological applications .",
    "the efforts that lead us to the theory of entanglement have been mainly focused on two aspects of the problem : given a certain state , is it entangled ?",
    "if yes , how much entanglement is there ?",
    "besides many advances ( both in the theoretical and in the experimental fields ) have been achieved , a complete theory describing entanglement is still lacking .",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews in ref .",
    "@xcite for a more complete discussion about entanglement . before we proceed ,",
    "let us define the entanglement for more general states , the mixed states . for systems described by a density operator @xmath20 , the separability condition given in eq .",
    "( [ ent ] ) becomes @xmath21 with @xmath22 being a probability distribution and @xmath23 a density operator for the subsystem @xmath9 . in the case of continuous variables",
    ", we must replace the summation by an integral over the entire probability space .",
    "the state ( [ entmix ] ) is the most general bipartite state that alice and bob can create using local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "therefore , an entangled state is that one that can not be prepared by locc .",
    "let us now go back to epr .",
    "despite all the progress achieved in the path to understanding the epr paradox , it was only in 1964 that it was put on a mathematical ground , making possible its experimental investigation . considering a model described by local hidden variables ( lhv ) , bell proved a theorem , today consisting in the so - called bell inequalities , confronting the predictions of quantum mechanics with those coming from the local realistic assumption @xcite .",
    "if a given state violates a bell inequality then , it is not possible to describe such a state by means of an lhv model , implying that local realism must be abandoned .",
    "a recent review about the theoretical and the experimental aspects of this theorem can be found in ref .",
    "we observe here that the extension of the quantum theory proposed by bell is classical , in the sense that the hidden variables are local in nature .",
    "however , more recently , colbeck and renner have shown , under the assumption that the measurement setting can be freely chosen by the observer , that the quantum theory can not be extended at all @xcite .    with concern to correlations ,",
    "the scenario regarding what was discussed until here is the following : the non - classical nature of correlations was attributed to states that violate some bell inequality .",
    "this kind of correlation , also named non - local , can not be explained by an lhv model .",
    "however , this situation changed in 1989 , when werner published an article showing that there are mixed entangled states that do not violate any bell inequality and therefore could be described by means of an lhv model @xcite .",
    "this was a surprising fact because it indicates that there are non - separable ( entangled ) mixed states that could be described in  classical terms by an lhv model .",
    "so , another kind of correlation arises , the one contained in an entangled state , but that do not violate any bell inequality .",
    "this kind of correlation is indeed non - classical since we disregard lhv models .",
    "this picture remained unchanged until 2001 , when it was identified a new kind of quantum correlation , which may be present even in separable ( non - entangled ) states .",
    "this new scenario emerged from an nonequivalence between the classical and the quantum versions of information theory .",
    "we may explore this nonequivalence in several ways in order to reveal some non - classicality . in what follows",
    "we will present a way to do it that we consider very illustrative . from bayes rule we can write the classical conditional probability for obtaining the value @xmath24 for the random variable @xmath0 when the value of the random variable @xmath1 is known to be @xmath25 , @xmath26 , in the form @xmath27 which leads to an equivalent expression for the classical mutual information ( [ minformation ] ) @xmath28 where the classical conditional entropy reads @xmath29 .    while eq .",
    "( [ minformation ] ) has a direct extension to the quantum territory , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ qmi ] ) , here we are faced with a fundamental fact : a measurement generally disturbs a quantum system .",
    "the problem arises when we try to extend the classical concept of the conditional entropy @xmath30 to the quantum domain .",
    "this quantity measures the uncertainty about the random variable @xmath0 after we _ measure _ @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , its extension to quantum mechanics presents some ambiguity due to the fact that , depending on the observable we choose to measure @xmath1 , the value of the conditional entropy would be different and may even be negative .    in order to obtain a quantum version of eq .",
    "( [ cmi2 ] ) , let us consider a set of measurements @xmath31 on subsystem @xmath1 of the composite state @xmath20 .",
    "the reduced state of subsystem @xmath0 , after the measurement , is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the probability for the measurement of the @xmath34-th state in subsystem @xmath1 and @xmath35 is the identity operator for subsystem @xmath0 .",
    "for a complete set of measurements @xmath36 , we can define the conditional entropy of subsystem @xmath0 , for a known subsystem @xmath1 , as @xmath37 thus , we can also define the following quantum extension for eq .",
    "( [ cmi2 ] ) @xmath38    while in the classical case we have the equivalence between both definitions of the mutual information in eqs .",
    "( [ minformation ] ) and ( [ cmi2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath39 , for a quantum state , eqs .",
    "( [ qmi ] ) and ( [ qmi2 ] ) are not equivalent in general any more . the difference",
    ", @xmath40 was called _ quantum discord _ ( qd ) by ollivier and zurek @xcite .",
    "one can say that eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) reveals the quantumness of the correlations between partitions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , since it shows the departure between the quantum and the classical versions of information theory .",
    "an important observation is that qd captures the non - classical aspects of correlations contained in certain states , which includes entanglement .",
    "however , while an entanglement measure @xcite vanishes for a separable state , qd may be non - zero for states of the form ( [ entmix ] ) .",
    "for the simplest case of bipartite pure states , qd is equal to entanglement .",
    "the information theoretic approach to study correlations also leaded us to a new definition of classical correlations .",
    "a quantum composite state may have the support of classical correlations , @xmath41 , which , for bipartite quantum states , can be quantified via the measure proposed by henderson and vedral @xcite : @xmath42 , \\label{hv}\\ ] ] where the maximum is taken over the complete set of positive operator valued measurements ( povm ) @xmath43 on subsystem @xmath1 . for two - qubit systems , since the conditional entropy is concave over the set of povms ( which is convex ) , the optimization is performed on the extreme points of the set of povms , which are rank 1 @xcite . for more general systems",
    ", this optimization can be performed over the complete povm set , which is a very difficult problem , even numerically .    from the above definitions",
    ", it follows immediately that @xmath44 . for pure states",
    ", we have a special situation where the quantum discord is equal to the entropy of entanglement and also equal to the henderson - vedral classical correlation .",
    "in other words , @xmath45 @xcite . in this case , the total amount of non - classical correlation is captured by an entanglement measure . on the other hand , for mixed states",
    ", the entanglement is only a part of the non - classical aspects of correlations @xcite .",
    "we may visualize the different  flavors of non - classical correlations considering the bell - diagonal class of states , as depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "the discovery that bipartite mixed separable ( non - entangled ) states can have non - classical correlations @xcite has opened a new perspective in the study and comprehension of quantum aspects of its nature .",
    "a recent result , that almost all quantum states have a non vanishing quantum discord @xcite , shows up the relevance of studying these correlations . such quantum correlations , that may be present in separable states , are conjectured to play a role in the quantum advantage of tasks in mixed state quantum information science @xcite .",
    "there are some important issues about quantification of non - classical correlations beyond entanglement .",
    "one of the most relevant to be noted at this point is the fact that almost all non - classicality measures , as qd , are based on extremization procedures that constitute a difficult problem , even numerically .",
    "actually , analytical solutions for the qd were obtained only recently for a certain class of highly symmetrical states @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , an alternative , operational ( without any extremization procedure ) quantifier is rather desirable .",
    "our aim in this article is to discuss some theoretical and experimental aspects of non - classical correlations , and its classical counterpart .",
    "the remaining of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pi ] we discuss some physical interpretations of the quantum discord ( the most popular measure of quantum correlations ) .",
    "as we shall see , the quantification of quantum correlations is still an open problem .",

    "[ ac ] we review the discussion about the role played by quantum correlations in several scenarios , including quantum information processing and critical systems , passing through biology and relativistic effects on these correlations . beyond theoretical developments , the experimental investigation of these correlations and of its dynamics",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "[ ec ] . a brief summary and",
    "our final discussions are presented in sec .",
    "quantum information science ( qis ) introduced a new way to think about quantum mechanics ( see @xcite for a more profound discussion in this direction ) .",
    "as mentioned in the last section , this new perspective motivates the introduction of a measure to quantify quantum correlations , the quantum discord .",
    "qd has been largely studied in a great variety of situations and a physical interpretation of such a quantity is quite desirable for the very foundations of the quantum theory . until now , we have two proposed interpretations for qd , one in thermodynamics @xcite and the other @xcite from the information theoretic perspective through the state merging protocol .      in an attempt to understand the limitations of thermodynamics , maxwell introduced a character ( today named maxwell s demon ) that permeates physics since then .",
    "furthermore , maxwell s demon plays a role also in information theory .",
    "in fact , thermodynamics and information theory present several links .",
    "developments in this direction have being achieved since the brillouin treatment of the informational entropy ( due to shannon ) and the thermodynamic entropy ( due to boltzmann ) on the same footing @xcite .",
    "an important relation between these two distinct sciences was explored by landauer to finally  exorcise maxwell s demon through his information erasure theorem @xcite .",
    "for a recent review about the physics of maxwell s demons from the perspective of information theory see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "maxwell s demon is usually modelled as a classical information processing device , whose role is to implement a suitable action based on previous information acquired by means of a classical measurement .",
    "the final goal of the demon is to extract work from the environment .",
    "zurek then asked if a quantum version of the demon would be more efficient in accomplishing this task than the classical one .",
    "this quantum demon was defined as a being that is able to measure non - local states and implement quantum conditional operations .",
    "zurek verified that not only the quantum demon really could extract more work than the classical one , but also that the difference in the work extraction is given by the qd @xcite .",
    "the machine considered by zurek consists of a system @xmath46 correlated with a measurement apparatus @xmath47 , and an environment @xmath48 at temperature @xmath49 .",
    "the demon reads the outcome of @xmath47 and then uses the acquired information to extract work from @xmath48 by letting @xmath46 to expand throughout the available phase ( or hilbert ) space . the difference in the work extraction by the classical and the quantum demons",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath50 in this equation , the quantum discord is given by @xmath51-s(\\rho_{\\mathcal{sm}})\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the measurement basis in the apparatus state space and @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the post - measurement entropies of the apparatus and system are given , respectively , by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with states and ( conditional ) entropies defined analogously to eq .",
    "( [ condstate ] ) and ( [ avercondent ] ) .",
    "this result tells us that the efficiency of the demon is determined by the information about @xmath46 that is accessible to the demon @xcite and that it can acquire more information by means of a quantum measurement when compared with a classical one .",
    "this is a direct relation between a thermodynamic quantity ( work ) and an information theoretic one ( quantum discord ) . in other words ,",
    "the quantum discord is a measure of the advantage obtained by means of the quantum dynamics . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that two different versions of quantum discord determine the difference between the efficiencies of a szilards engine under different sets of restrictions .",
    "it is important to observe here that despite the quantum nature of the demon , his memory is still classical .    a closely related discussion was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors considered the landauer s erasure principle , which states that in order to erase the information stored in a given system , we must perform an amount of work that is proportional to the entropy of that system , in the presence of a quantum memory .",
    "then , they showed that the difference between the work cost of the erasure procedure using a quantum and a classical memory is given by @xmath56 , with the quantum discord being defined as the difference between the uncertainty about the system for an observer possessing a quantum @xmath57 and a classical @xmath58 memory , i.e. , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the role of information in thermodynamics has been largely discussed in recent literature , with the main focus on the information formulation of thermodynamics ( see @xcite and , for a quantum formulation of thermodynamics , see @xcite ) . in this direction ,",
    "a single - mode photo - carnot engine was considered @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the engine was related to the quantum discord and it was demonstrated that it can be larger than that of a purely classical engine , showing that quantum correlations could be an important ingredient in thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this result can be viewed as another thermodynamical interpretation of qd .",
    "a review on the paradigm concerning the connections between quantum information theory and thermodynamics was presented in @xcite .",
    "information , in the form of pure quantum states , can be used to extract work from a heat reservoir . in general , by using a system in the state @xmath60 and in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath49 , one can draw an amount @xmath61 of work , where @xmath62 is a measure of information in @xmath60 and @xmath63 is the dimension of the system s state space ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 determines the optimal rate of transitions between states under noise operations ( no : unitary transformations , partial trace , and addition of ancillary systems in maximal mixed states ) .",
    "that is , given @xmath66 copies of @xmath60 one can distil @xmath67 pure qubits .",
    "conversely one can take @xmath67 pure states and produced @xmath66 copies of @xmath60 , using no ( see @xcite and references therein for more details about the properties of @xmath68 ) .",
    "local information is a resource and the sound measure of information @xmath68 can be used , with actions restricted to closed locc operations ( clocc : unitary transformations and sending systems down a complete dephasing channel ) , to study how many product pure states ( e.g. , @xmath69 ) alice and bob can distil from a joint state @xmath20 , in the distant laboratory paradigm .",
    "the maximal amount of local information that they can extract in this way is called localizable information and is defined as @xmath70\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\log d_{ab}-\\min_{\\lambda\\in clocc}[s(\\tilde{\\rho}_{a})+s(\\tilde{\\rho}_{b})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath71 and the extremization is taken over the clocc operations . besides @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the reduced states of @xmath74 . the total information in @xmath20",

    "the information that alice and bob can extract acting locally , without using a classical channel to communicate , reads @xmath77 thus the classical information deficit : @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be seen as a measure of classical correlation , since it tells us how much more information can be obtained by exploiting additional correlations in @xmath20 through a classical channel . for more details of this and",
    "related quantities we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now turn our attention to interpretations of qd from the point of view of asymptotic information processing tasks , the so - called information theoretic interpretations .",
    "this kind of physical ground is relevant for the consideration of qd as a measure of quantum correlations or as a presumed resource for quantum information tasks . in two articles recently published @xcite ,",
    "it was given , independently , such an interpretation , by considering the state merging protocol @xcite . given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems , the quantum communication needed to transfer the full state to one of the systems",
    "is called partial quantum information .",
    "the quantum state merging protocol was introduced to optimally transfer quantum partial information @xcite .",
    "the protocol is based on prior information , shared between both partners , as measured by the conditional entropy .",
    "it is important to note that , in this section , when we say conditional entropy we are referring to a direct extension of the classical conditional entropy , which means that we are considering @xmath79 . note that if there are no correlations between both partners , the conditional entropy is just equal to the entropy of one of the partners .",
    "therefore , the state merging protocol takes advantage of the previous correlations between both partners to reduce the communication cost . for the classical case ,",
    "the conditional entropy is always positive , implying a positive communication cost .",
    "however , in the quantum domain , this quantity may become negative , and in that fact lies the core of the protocol as well as the information - theoretic interpretation of qd .",
    "it is important to note here that the protocol as well as the interpretations of qd based on it must be taken in the asymptotic limit of an infinity number of copies . in this case",
    ", we can define the regularized discord as @xmath80 in the remaining of this section we will be referring , unless stated otherwise , to this generalized definition of qd .",
    "cavalcanti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the state merging protocol as follows : a pure state @xmath81 is shared between the partners @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the aim of the protocol is that @xmath0 transfers her part to @xmath1 by using classical communication and shared entanglement between them while maintaining the coherence with the reference state @xmath82 .",
    "if the partial information is positive ( as it always is in the classical case ) @xmath0 needs to send this number of qubits to @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the partial information is negative ( which is permitted in the quantum domain ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 instead acquire the corresponding potential for future quantum communication @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the entanglement consumption in the protocol is equal to the qd between @xmath0 and @xmath82 , with measurements on @xmath82",
    ". an immediate consequence of these results is an interpretation of the asymmetric character of qd .",
    "it is a measure of the difference in the resources needed for @xmath0 and @xmath82 to send their parts of the initial state to @xmath1 , through the state merging protocol . as a by - product",
    ", they have also noted that the quantum discord may be regarded as an indicator of the direction in which more classical information can be sent through dense coding .    in a related article madhok and datta @xcite , using the strong sub - additivity property of quantum entropy , @xmath83 , provided another interpretation of qd .",
    "this property tells us that having more prior information makes the state merging protocol cheaper . on the other hand",
    ", the loss of information will increase the communication cost of the protocol .",
    "what the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown is that the minimum increase of communication cost due to all possible measurements that can be performed on @xmath1 is given by the qd between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the state merging protocol is inherently asymmetric ( due to the definition of the conditional entropy ) , so the asymmetry of qd has a direct interpretation as well .",
    "the fact that qd can have both thermodynamic and information - theoretic interpretations , as discussed above , touches in the important relationship between these two ( assumed ) independent areas , a relation noted years before by brillouin @xcite . this interesting research field has attracted much attention in the recent literature and certainly deserves further investigations .",
    "as stated in the introduction , qd does not seems to be the definitive word for the quantification of non - classical correlations in a general way .",
    "this section explores some of the proposed measures of such correlations , others than entanglement , as well as for their classical counterparts . as we shall see",
    ", we do not have a closed theory for the characterization and quantification of such correlations .",
    "let us start with what we think that broadly defines quantum correlations , i.e. , the impossibility of locally broadcasting it .",
    "_ no - local - broadcasting theorem _",
    " m piani , p. horodecki and r. horodecki have introduced a theorem providing an operational classification of multipartite classical correlations and , hence , for its quantum counterpart @xcite .",
    "their theorem is based on the impossibility of locally broadcasting , i.e. , on the impossibility of locally distributing correlations in order to have many copies of the original state .",
    "purely classical correlations are those permitting such distribution .    for the bipartite case they proved that the correlations ( measured by the mutual information ) that can be totally transferred from the quantum to the classical world are those present in a state of the form @xmath84 these are the so - called classical - classical states ( cc ) .",
    "in this equation , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are orthonormal basis for the subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and @xmath87 is a joint probability distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "if a given state can not be cast in the form ( [ cc ] ) it must contain non - classical correlations .",
    "they then extended this definition to the multipartite case .",
    "we note here a close resemblance between this definition and the one regarding the separability problem .",
    "although this result does not really quantify the amount of quantum correlations in a given state , it clearly indicates its presence or not .",
    "the authors then go further by proposing a measure for such correlations , in a clear analogy with qd .",
    "the proposed quantifier for non - classicality , for the bipartite case , is given by @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the mutual information and @xmath90 the cc mutual information of state @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath91 is a povm set for partition @xmath9 .",
    "the extension of this quantity for the multipartite case depends on the definition of mutual information , which can be obtained by means of a distance in the probability space @xcite .    due to the symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) ( it is invariant under permutation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) we can not directly translate the interpretations of quantum discord of the last section , which are based on the asymmetric state merging protocol , to the quantifier proposed in eq .",
    "( [ qdh ] ) .",
    "however , this quantity already has an information theoretic interpretation in terms of the impossibility of locally distributing correlations .",
    "this observation leaves open the question about the existence of a thermodynamic interpretation for this quantity .",
    "equation ( [ classicalcorr ] ) can be regarded as a symmetric version of qd .",
    "the symmetric aspects of correlations quantifiers was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . employing orthonormal projective measures instead of the more general povms , an analytical expression for this quantity was also provided in refs .",

    "@xcite ( see also sec .",
    "[ tid ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) have proposed a thermodynamic quantifier for quantum correlations . considering a scenario in which alice and bob share a correlated state they defined the _ work deficit _ @xmath92 as the difference in the amount of work that can be extracted by alice and bob through clocc and by one of the partners holding the whole state , i.e. , the work that can not be locally extracted .",
    "in other words , @xmath92 is a measure of the difference between work that can be extracted in the case where the information is distributed and in the case where it is localized . for the case of pure states , @xmath92 is exactly equal to the amount of distillable entanglement , while for the general case , it is equal to the amount of quantum correlations ( including entanglement ) shared by the two partners @xcite .",

    "this section is devoted to the experimental aspects of quantum and classical correlations .",
    "only a few experiments on this issue have been reported up - to - date in literature .",
    "the first experiment in this context was performed to test the conjecture that the quantum correlations , as measured by qd , are the figure of merit for the speed - up in mixed - state quantum computation without or with little entanglement @xcite .",
    "using an all - optical architecture , the generation of correlations in the trace estimation dqc1 ( deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ) protocol was observed and no entanglement has been found , despite the fact that an exponential speed - up ( in comparison with the best known classical protocol ) is obtained with this protocol .",
    "however , a large amount of qd was generated , indicating that , although fully separable , mixed states can contain non - classical correlations that may be a valuable resource for quantum information technology @xcite .    from a more fundamental point of view , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have confirmed experimentally the sudden change behaviour of correlations , as well as their immunity against some sources of decoherence , both phenomena theoretically predicted in ref . @xcite . also using an all - optical setup",
    "the authors followed the dynamics of correlations under the action of a simulated dephasing environment in a controllable way .",
    "the experimental observation showed an excellent agreement with the theory @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the environment is a non - dissipative one , i.e. , there is no energy exchange between system and environment .",
    "only phase relations are lost . to fit this gap , in ref .",
    "@xcite the same phenomena was demonstrated , but in this case , with the presence of a real dephasing channel and also of the amplitude damping channel , responsible for the energy exchange between system and environment .",
    "such phenomena was shown to occur in a liquid state room temperature nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiment @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the sc may occur in general scenarios being therefore a general property of quantum correlations .",
    "the decoherence dynamics of correlations under the action of two independent amplitude damping channels ( one for each qubit ) and a global phase damping one was studied in ref .",
    "the experiment was performed in a solid state nmr system at room temperature . a theory to obtain the correlations from the nmr deviation matrix",
    "was also developed in this article , and an excellent agreement with the experimental data was obtained @xcite , uncovering thus the quantum nature of correlations in room temperature nmr systems . another reported experiment concerns the non - markovian character of the decoherent dynamics of correlations @xcite . by means of a controlled dephasing non - markovian environment ,",
    "the multiple sudden change behavior was observed .",
    "more recently , it was reported the first experimental observation of a witness for quantum correlations @xcite , theoretically proposed in @xcite . also employing the liquid nmr architecture , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have measured directly the witness in eq .",
    "( [ mw ] ) with high precision .",
    "this result implies that it is possible to determine the quantum nature of correlations by means of only a few local measurements , without the necessity of the expensive tomographic process and also avoiding the extremization procedures involved in the quantification of quantum correlations . a modified version of the witness proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite was presented and also implemented in an optical setup through the measurement of a single observable in @xcite .",
    "the condition for non - zero quantum discord introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( based on the rank of the correlation matrix ) was employed in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite in the nmr setup , in order to demonstrate the non - classicality in the dqc1 algorithm using four qubits .",
    "in this section , we will discuss some applications of these general quantum and classical correlations in different contexts , like quantum computation and biological systems .",
    "as we shall see , there is an increasing interest in such studies due to both fundamental and technological reasons .",
    "it is well accepted today that quantum mechanics can provide us a gain ( in the computational time , or in the parameter estimation , for instance ) over equivalent classical protocols .",
    "however , the source of such a gain , initially thought to be the entanglement , is not so clear @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we shall present some recent developments in this direction .    in an article published in physical review a",
    ", datta and gharibian @xcite have analysed the role played by quantum correlations in the so - called mixed - state quantum computation , focusing in particular on the dqc1 model , proposed by knill and laflamme @xcite . considering separable states ,",
    "the authors have found indications that the quantum correlations , as quantified by mid , could be the source of the speed - up in the dqc1 model @xcite .",
    "the qd was proposed as being the source of the quantum advantage in the dqc1 model in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . studying how correlations behave in the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have concluded that entanglement is not the unique signature of efficient quantum computation , and it is not even necessary for protocols which present gain over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "the prisoners dilemma and other quantum games were analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite with similar conclusions . by analysing the mixed - state phase estimation , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that , although classical correlations do not play an important role in this process , the @xmath243 gain is still present when entanglement vanishes , but not the qd .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that quantum discord is responsible for the advantage in the quantum locking protocol , where entanglement is known to play no role .",
    "the connection between the mother protocol of quantum information theory and quantum discord was discussed in @xcite .    walking in the opposite direction , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the ability to create entanglement is necessary for the execution of bipartite quantum gates .",
    "in other words , to execute such a gate , starting with the locc should be supplemented by shared entanglement .",
    "qd is then related to the failure of the locc implementation of the gate @xcite .",
    "a related work , linking qd and entanglement as a resource for quantum computation was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in 1997 , grover proposed an algorithm using quantum mechanics to obtain a quadratic temporal speed - up in search applications over unsorted data @xcite . in a recent article",
    "the role of classical and quantum correlations was analysed in such scenario @xcite .",
    "it was argued that entanglement works as the indicator of the increasing rate of the success probability of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "as we can see , despite all the progress , the debate about the source of quantum effectiveness is still an open question .",
    "quantum theory and relativity are the two main pillars on which rests the modern physics .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask how the behaviour of quantum correlations is changed when relativity comes into play .",
    "this subsection only deals with relativistic effects on quantum discord .",
    "a discussion on the role of relativity in information theory can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "contrary to entanglement , there are only a few articles discussing the relativistic aspects of non - classical correlations so far .",
    "the first one is due to datta @xcite .",
    "the system under consideration is a two , initially entangled , modes of the scalar field .",
    "the correlations shared by them were analysed in the case when the observer detecting one of the modes undergoes a constant acceleration , while the other stayed inertial .",
    "it was found that while entanglement dies due to the unruh effect , a considerable amount of quantum discord still survives , even in the limit of infinite acceleration @xcite , which is a very interesting result since , in this limit , the accelerated observer should experience an infinite temperature thermal bath @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations in a two - qubit system when one of them is uniformly accelerated during a finite amount of proper time was analysed by cleri and collaborators in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , while the quantum correlations , as measured by symmetric quantum discord @xcite , is completely destroyed in the limit of infinite acceleration , the classical one remains nonzero @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note here that such correlations exhibit the sc behavior @xcite as a function of acceleration ( the temperature of the associated unruh thermal bath experienced by the qubit is directly proportional to its proper acceleration @xcite ) .",
    "these results were then extended to the case where the qubits lie in the vicinity of a black hole , with one of them freely falling into the hole ( the inertial qubit ) while the other staying static ( the accelerated one ) near the event horizon .    in another interesting article , the case of correlations between modes of dirac fields in non - inertial frames",
    "was considered @xcite .",
    "it was found that the classical correlations decrease as the acceleration increases , which is in sharp contrast with the scalar field case where the classical correlations do not depend on acceleration @xcite .",
    "moreover , the original correlations shared by alice and rob ( the accelerated bob ) from an inertial perspective are redistributed between all the bipartite modes from a non - inertial perspective @xcite",
    ".    therefore , the dynamic behaviour of classical and quantum correlations can be very different depending on the system under consideration .",
    "this is an issue that certainly deserves more study to permit us to understand its dynamic fundamental aspects .",
    "besides the fundamental questions , relativistic effects on correlations became important for the attempt of constructing global communications systems based on quantum mechanics .",
    "the study of critical systems has attracted the interest of a wide variety of scientists , both from the classical and quantum viewpoints . in general , the main element for such studies is the concept of correlations .",
    "indeed , changes in these correlations strongly affect the observable properties of a many - body system and are responsible , for instance , to quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , which is a critical change in the ground state of a quantum system due to level crossings in its energy spectrum ( for an introduction on quantum phase transitions see @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss here the developments obtained in the context of quantum and classical correlations concepts applied to quantum critical systems .",
    "we shall discuss only some of these developments and refer the reader to other references .",
    "quantum discord was applied to the study of qpts in the transverse field ising model @xmath244 and in the antiferromagnetic _ xxz _ spin @xmath245 model @xmath246 with the sum running over the nearest - neighbours @xmath247 @xcite . for both models , in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the amount of qd increases close to the critical points , indicating that qd could be a good indicator of the existence of such points in the system , as a qualitative detector . on the other hand ,",
    "the derivatives of the qd ( with respect to the parameter that drives the qpt ) provide precise information on the location and on the order of the qpts @xcite .",
    "such analysis was generalized by means of analytical expressions for the correlations in each model and also by discussing their finite - size behaviour in ref .",
    "signatures of the critical behaviour of the system for the cases of first - order , second - order , and infinite order qpts was found in both classical correlations and qd @xcite .",
    "the pairwise correlation in the two - spin one - dimensional _ xyz _ heisenberg model , @xmath248 at finite temperature was considered in ref .",
    "the authors have studied the dependence of qd on the temperature and also on the external magnetic field @xmath1 acting on both qubits . a very distinct behaviour from entanglement was found and it was conjectured that qd is able to detect a qpt even at finite temperature @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was reported a study of the qd behaviour in the thermodynamic limit of the anisotropic _ xy _ spin-@xmath245 chains in a transverse magnetic field @xmath249 \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\sum_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{z } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering both cases , for zero and finite temperatures . after obtaining analytical expressions for pairwise correlations at any distant sites , it was shown that , at zero temperature , qd can be able to detect a qpt even for situations where entanglement fails in this task . for finite temperatures , the authors showed that qd can increase with temperature in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a remarkable property of qd was provided in ref .",
    "@xcite where , analysing the _ xxz _ model , it was shown that , indeed , qd can indicate the critical points associated with qpt .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast to entanglement as well as to others thermodynamic quantities .",
    "another interesting result was recently reported in ref .",
    "pairwise qd was analysed as a function of distance between spins in the transverse field xy chain and in the xxz chain in the presence of domain walls .",
    "it was found a long - range decay of quantum discord , that indicate the critical points in these systems .",
    "this behaviour is rather different from entanglement , which is typically short - ranged .",
    "moreover , a clear change in the decay rate of correlations when the system crosses the critical point was predicted @xcite .    beyond these developments",
    ", there are many other articles in recent literature considering the quantum aspects of correlations in critical systems .",
    "for instance , the case of the _ xy _ chain was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the _ xx _ model in a nonuniform external magnetic field was reported in ref . @xcite and the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in a many body system in ref .",
    "a comparison of the qd with the work - deficit was provided in ref . @xcite and the mid in ref .",
    "the qd and entanglement were computed and compared for some systems whose ground states can be expressed as matrix product states in @xcite .",
    "all the above results show that qd could play an important role in critical systems from both point of views theoretical and experimental .",
    "so , it is a very interesting quantity to be explored in the condensed matter scenario .      the quantum description of biological molecules and , in particular , the role that quantum mechanics could play in biological processes , have attracted much attention in the recent literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "although very controversial , some developments were obtained , mainly linking entanglement with the efficiency of a given process @xcite .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to present the study of classical and quantum correlations in such a systems , recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this program is to identify whether quantum mechanical effects are present in biological systems , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have analysed the role that qd , and its classical counterpart , play in the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction center , by the so - called fenna - matthews - olson protein complex .",
    "the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that a significant fraction of the total correlation in such a process is due to qd in the first picosecond ( the relevant time scale for this dynamics ) .",
    "it is important to note that this result was obtained both at cryogenic and physiological temperatures @xcite .    despite very speculative ,",
    "these works raise many questions about the role played by quantum mechanics in biological systems . concerning quantum correlations",
    "we could ask how the efficiency of a given process scales with quantum discord ( or other correlation measure ) ?",
    "another interesting question is if it is possible to model some molecules , like the dna , by means of a spin chain and , as a consequence , we could apply the results of the preceding subsection to these systems .",
    "besides the developments presented here , there are many articles devoted to the study of classical and quantum correlations in several others scenarios . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of qd between two atoms interacting with a cavity field was analysed and the spin - boson model in ref .",
    "applications in the solid state scenario can be found for the case of quantum dots in ref .",
    "since the publication of the epr criticism to quantum mechanics , the concept of classical and non - classical correlations has been greatly modified , as we have seen in the introduction of this article . we have evolved from correlations violating a bell s inequality to quantum correlations measured , for example , by the quantum discord , passing through entanglement . in this short review , we focused on the non - classical aspects of correlations presented in separable states , as the ones revealed by the quantum discord .",
    "we saw that there are several quantifiers for such correlations and none of them seems to be definitive . despite the development achieved recently in this issue",
    ", the question concerning what is quantum in a correlated system , is still a bit open .    beyond its fundamental aspects , another important and controversial",
    "subject was raised together with the birth of the concept of quantum discord - like correlations , the one concerning its application for quantum information processing .",
    "the main question in this direction is what is responsible for the advantages ( over purely classical systems ) provided by quantum theory . besides some controversial questions there are advances in this direction .",
    "for instance , we certainly know that such kind of non - classicality plays an important role in communication , as revealed by the non - local broadcasting @xcite , and in quantum metrology @xcite , among other scenarios .",
    "the investigation of the precise role of separable mixed states with non - classical correlations opens a very exiting avenue of research .",
    "the experimental investigation of the behaviour of these correlations has been started only very recently .",
    "we have only a few experimental investigations at our disposal , and much more need to be done in order to lead us to a better test and comprehension about the quantum nature of correlations in composed systems .",
    "the application of these correlations to another areas like condensed matter physics and biological systems is in its early stages and a long way is still to be traversed in order to appreciate the true role of these correlations in these different fields of knowledge .",
    "we hope that this review will call attention to the importance of discord - like correlations and will stimulate further research on the subject .",
