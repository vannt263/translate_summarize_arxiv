    "the two - slit interference experiment with particles has become a cornerstone for studying wave - particle duality .",
    "so fundamental is the way in which the two - slit experiment captures the essence of quantum theory , that feynman ventured to state that it is a phenomenon  which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics ; in reality it contains the _ only _ mystery \" of the theory @xcite . that radiation and massive particles can exhibit both wave nature and particle nature in different experiment ,",
    "had become quite clear in the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , niels bohr emphasized that wave - nature , characterized by two - slit interference , and the particle - nature , characterized by the knowledge of which slit the particle passed through , are mutually exclusive @xcite .",
    "in doing this he raised this concept to the level of a new fundamental principle .    much later",
    ", this principle was made quantitatively precise by deriving a bound on the extent to which the two natures could be observed simultaneously , by greenberger and yasin @xcite and later by englert @xcite .",
    "greenberger and yasin characterised the particle nature by the ability to correctly predict which slit the particle passed through @xcite .",
    "this predictability was based only on the initial state of the particle , and not on any measurement on it .",
    "englert characterised the particle nature by the ability to distinguish between the two paths of the particle , by an actual measurement @xcite .",
    "he introduced a quantity @xmath2 for this purpose , which took values between 0 and 1 .",
    "the wave nature was characterised by the visibility of the interference , given by @xmath3 .",
    "the relation putting a bound on the path distinguishability and fringe visibility is given by @xcite @xmath4 thus one can see that @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can take values between 0 and 1 , are dependent on each other .",
    "a full which - way information ( @xmath5 ) would surely wash out the interference ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "( [ egy ] ) can be thought to be a quantitative statement of bohr s complementarity principle .",
    "it smoothly interpolates between the two extreme scenarios discussed by bohr , namely , full which - way information and no which - way information .    a dramatic manifestation of bohr s",
    "complementarity principle has been demonstrated in the so - called quantum eraser . here , ",
    "erasing \" the which - way information after the particle has passed through the slits , allows one to recover the lost interference fringes @xcite .",
    "wave - particle duality has also been connected to various other phenomena .",
    "connection of wave - particle duality with uncertainty relations has been investigated @xcite .",
    "an interesting complementarity between entanglement and the visibility of interference has been demonstrated for two - path interference @xcite . that the entanglement between the particle and which - path detector is what affects the visibility of interference , is also the view we take in this investigation .",
    "various aspects of complementarity were also explored by jaeger , shimony and vaidman @xcite where they also explored the case where the particle can follow multiple path , and not just two , before interfering .",
    "bohr s principle of complementarity should surely apply to multi - slit experiments too .",
    "however , one might wonder if one can find a quantitatively precise statement of it for multi - slit experiments .",
    "various attempts have been made to formulate a quantitatively precise statement of complementarity , some kind of a duality relation , for the case of multibeam interferometers @xcite .",
    "however , the issue is still not satisfactorily resolved . beyond",
    "the well studied two - slit experiment , the simplest multi - beam case is the 3-slit interference experiment .",
    "englert s duality relation was derived only in the context of 2-slit experiments , and one would like an analogous relation for the case of 3-slit experiments .",
    "that is the focus of this paper .",
    "of late there has been a newly generated focus on the three - slit interference experiments @xcite , albeit for a different reason .",
    "three slit interference is somewhat more involved than its 2-slit counterpart simply due to the fact that while the two - slit interference is the result of interference between two parts coming from the two slits , in the 3-slit interference there are three parts which interfere in different ways . in the general case , if we assume that the separation between slits 1 and 2 is @xmath7 and that between slits 2 and 3 is @xmath8 , there are two interferences from slit 1 and 2 and from slit 2 and slit 3 .",
    "in addition there is an interference between parts from slit 1 and 3 , which involves a slit separation of @xmath9 . in the case where the two slit separations are the same , @xmath10 , there are two interferences with slit separation @xmath11 and one interference with slit separation @xmath12 .",
    "having more than two slits also allows , in principle , the possibility of having different geometrical arrangement of slits .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to the case of three slits in a linear geometry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ trislit ] , as that is the geometry in which the experiment is usually done , and that is also the geometry which is used in previous investigations of multi - slit experiments .",
    "we expect additional complicacy in interpreting bohr s complementarity because if we know that the particle did not go through ( say ) slit 3 , it may not imply complete loss of interference as there is still ambiguity regarding which of the other two slits , 1 or 2 , the particle went through .",
    "first we would like to have a way of knowing which of the three slits the particle passed through .",
    "any which - path detector should have three states which should correlate with the particle passing through each slit .",
    "let these states be @xmath13 , which correspond to particle passing through slits 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "without loss of generality we assume that the states @xmath13 are normalized , although they may not necessarily be mutually orthogonal .",
    "the combined state of the particle and the which - path detector can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the amplitudes of the particle passing through the slit 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "particle passes through slits 1 , 2 , and 3 with probabilities @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath13 are mutually orthogonal , we can find a hermitian operator ( and thus , a measurable quantity ) which will give us different eigenvalues corresponding to latexmath:[$|d_1\\rangle , |d_2\\rangle ,    three slit . in this case ,",
    "which slit the particle went through , can be known without ambiguity .    if @xmath13 are not mutually orthogonal , the three ways of particle going through the slits will not be fully distinguishable .",
    "one needs to define a _",
    "distinguishability _ of the three different paths of the particle . defining distinguishability in multi - slit experiments",
    "has been a thorny issue @xcite .",
    "as one can see from ( [ correlated ] ) , the problem of distinguishing the three paths of the particle boils down to distinguishing between the three states @xmath13 . in the following we describe a well established method of _ unambiguously _ discriminating between two non - orthogonal quantum states , which goes by the name of unambiguous quantum state discrimination ( uqsd ) @xcite .",
    "if two states @xmath20 are not orthogonal , it is impossible to distinguish between the two with certainty . what uqsd does is to separate the measurement results into two categories .",
    "first category is the one in which the discrimination fails .",
    "the second one distinguishes between the two states _ without any error_. let the first system , whose states are @xmath20 interact with a second system which is initially in a state @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction and time evolution leads to the following entangled states @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a unitary operator such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if one measures an observable of the second system which has two eigenstates @xmath26 with different eigenvalues , the result @xmath27 lands us into a situation where the non - orthogonal states @xmath20 have been replaced by orthogonal @xmath28 .",
    "the orthogonal states @xmath28 can be distinguished with hundred percent accuracy , thus distinguishing the original @xmath20 without error .",
    "however , the other result for system 2 , @xmath29 , leads us to states @xmath30 which are not orthogonal , and the discrimination of @xmath20 fails .",
    "so , either the process fails , or it distinguishes between @xmath20 without error .",
    "the probability of successfully distinguishing between @xmath31 and @xmath32 depends on the constants @xmath33 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the maximum probability of successfully distinguishing between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is given by @xcite @xmath34 this is called the idp ( ivanovic - dieks - peres ) limit , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 can not be distinguished unambiguously with a probability larger than this , even in principle @xcite . in other words , uqsd is the best bet for discriminating between two non - orthogonal states .",
    "this fact has also been experimentally demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "thus , the idp limit sets a fundamental bound on the distinguishability of two non - orthogonal states .",
    "the preceding analysis suggests a natural definition of path - distinguishability . in a two - slit experiment ,",
    "if the combined state of the particle and the which way detector can be written as @xmath35 , the two paths can be distinguished if the two states @xmath36 can be distinguished .",
    "the probability of successfully telling which slit the particle went through is just the probability with which @xmath36 can be unambiguously distinguished .",
    "we thus define distinguishability of the two paths in a double - slit experiment as the upper limit of the probability of unambiguously distinguishing between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus we define a new path distinguishability for a two - slit experiment as @xmath39 we denote it by @xmath0 to distinguish it from the @xmath2 used in ( [ egy ] ) .    in the 3-slit experiment ,",
    "the entangled state ( [ correlated ] ) implies that , after the particle has passed through the triple slit , the which - path detector could be in state @xmath37 or @xmath38 or @xmath40 , with probabilities @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . the probability with which one can tell which of the three slits the particle went through , is just the probability with which one can distinguish between @xmath41 .",
    "so , the problem of distinguishing between the three paths boils down to distinguishing between three non - orthogonal states @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 , which occur with different probabilities .",
    "uqsd has also been generalized to the case of n non - orthogonal states .",
    "the probability of unambiguously distinguishing between n non - orthogonal quantum states is bounded by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the @xmath44 non - orthogonal states , and @xmath45 are their respective a - priori probabilities . for three non - orthogonal states ,",
    "the above reduces to @xmath46    we define the path - distinguishability for the 3-slit experiment as the upper limit of the probability with which one can distinguish between the three states @xmath41 , which is now given by @xmath47 and whose value lies in the range @xmath48 .",
    "( [ d3 ] ) should be seen as a generalization of the idp limit to the case of three non - orthogonal states .      in order to obtain a tight bound on the visibility of interference , given a particular amount of which - way information , we do a wave - packet analysis in the following way .",
    "we consider a particle traveling along the z - direction and passing through the triple - slit , with a slit separations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and then interacting with a which - path detector through a unitary evolution .",
    "the evolution of the state is given by the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the hamiltonian of the system ( the energy operator ) .",
    "our strategy is the following .",
    "the motion of the particle along the z - axis is redundant , as it only translates the position of the particle from the triple - slit to the screen .",
    "what is relevant is the motion and dispersion of the particle along the x - direction . without going into the details of the which - path detector",
    ", we assume that it is a device having 3 states @xmath51 , and the three slits are located at @xmath52 .",
    "the wavefunction emerging from a particular slit is assumed to be a gaussian wave - packet in the x - direction , of width @xmath53 , localized at @xmath54 .",
    "a wavefunction of the form @xmath55 should represent the particle emerging from a slit of width @xmath53 , located at @xmath56 , in a reasonable approximation . as we shall see later",
    ", the choice of the gaussian form does not lead to any loss of generality because the width of the gaussians does not appear in the final results .    using this strategy , the combined state of the particle and the which - path detector , when the particle emerges from the triple - slit ( time @xmath57 ) , will be of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "it represents three gaussian wave - packets localised at the three slits , namely @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , entangled with the three states of the which - path detector .",
    "the width of the three gaussians is chosen to be the same because the widths of the three slits is assumed to be the same .",
    "it is not difficult to see , from the subsequent analysis , that even if we consider the three slit - widths to be different , e.g. , @xmath64 , they would all drop out from our final result . in general",
    "one should consider a factor @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 , and likewise for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we do not consider these phase factors simply because they will be absorbed in certain phases introduced later , in section [ interference ] .",
    "we consider the probabilities of all the three paths to be different for generality , but point out that unequal probabilities reduce the visibility of interference . even in the two - slit interference ,",
    "unequal beams reduce the visibility of interference .    after a time @xmath69 , the state of the particle and the detector evolves via ( [ se ] ) , with @xmath70 , to @xmath71 where @xmath72^{-1/2}$ ] .",

    "the phases @xmath80 being arbitrary , any additional phases coming from the amplitudes of the initial state ( [ initial ] ) would be absorbed in them .",
    "the probability density then reduces to @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "visibility of the interference fringes is conventionally defined as @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 represent the maximum and minimum intensity in neighbouring fringes , respectively .",
    "since all the factors multiplying the cosine terms in ( [ pattern ] ) are non - negative , the maxima of the fringe pattern will occur where the value of all the cosines is @xmath88 .",
    "the minima will occur where value of all the cosines is @xmath89 at the same time .",

    "ideal _ visibility can then be written down as @xmath95 where @xmath96e^{-{d^2\\over 2\\sigma^2}}\\right)$ ] . in reality",
    ", fringe visibility will be reduced due many factors , including the width of the slits .",
    "for example , if the width of the slits is very large , the fringes may not be visible at all .",
    "it will also get reduced by the varying phases @xmath97 . in an ideal situation",
    ", the maximum visibility one can theoretically get will be in the case when @xmath98 , which amounts to assuming that the spread of a particular wave - packet , when it reaches the screen , is so large that the separation between two neighboring slits @xmath11 is negligible in comparison , and also when all the phases are either zero or their effect cancels out .",
    "actual fringe visibility will be less than or equal to that , and can be written as @xmath99 using ( [ d3 ] ) the above equation gives @xmath100 eqn .",
    "( [ duality ] ) is a new duality relation which puts a bound on how much which - way information we can obtain and how much fringe visibility we can get at the same time .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath101 is possible only for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 implies @xmath6 .",
    "note that ( [ duality ] ) can also be expressed in another form @xmath104      when the three slits are equally spaced , maximum is achieved when the two @xmath105 terms and the @xmath106 term have values + 1 at the same time , which happens when @xmath107 , provided that @xmath97 are zero . when the three slits are unequal , the three terms @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can not all have values + 1 at the same time .",
    "thus the maximum intensity will be smaller than that in the equally spaced case , or @xmath111 .",
    "minimum intensity in the equally spaced case is attained when all the cosine terms are equal to @xmath89 , which happens when @xmath112 , provided that @xmath97 are zero .",
    "when the three slits are unequally spaced , the three terms @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can not all have values @xmath89 at the same time .",
    "thus the minimum intensity will be larger than that in the equally spaced case , or @xmath113 .",
    "these two observations lead to the straightforward conclusion that fringe visibility in the case of unequal slits will be strictly smaller than that in the case of equal slits , other things being the same , @xmath114 using the above in conjunction with ( [ v3 ] ) we can write for the fringe visibility , for the case of unequal slits @xmath115 using ( [ d3 ] ) the above equation gives @xmath116 note the strictly less than sign in the above , in contrast with ( [ duality ] ) .",
    "the above relation implies that if the slits are unequally spaced , even if the distinguishability @xmath117 is reduced to zero , the visibility of interference can never be 1 .",
    "the reason of this behaviour lies in the fact that a certain amount of loss of interference visibility is rooted not in the path distinguishability , but in the unequal spacing of the three slits .",
    "let us look at some special cases arising from the fact that there are not two , but three slit .",
    "suppose we have a which - path detector which can detect with certainty if the particle has passed through slit 1 or not .",
    "if the particle has not passed through slit 1 , the detector is unable to say which of the other two slits , 2 or 3 , has the particle taken .",
    "such a scenario can occur , for example , if we have a tiny camera in front of slit 1 which , for each particle , can say if the particle has gone through slit 1 or not . in this case",
    "@xmath37 is orthogonal to both @xmath38 and @xmath40 , and @xmath38 , @xmath40 are parallel .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , @xmath120 , the distinguishability @xmath0 , in this case is @xmath121    physically what is happening is the following .",
    "particle going through slits 2 and 3 gives rise to a sharp interference pattern , however , particle going through slit 1 gives rise to a uniform background particle count , thus reducing the overall visibility of the fringes arising from slits 2 and 3 .",
    "let us consider another case where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are orthogonal to each other , but both have equal overlap with @xmath40 .",
    "such a case can be exemplified by @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where @xmath125 form an orthonormal set . in this case",
    "( again , for simplicity , assuming @xmath120 ) the distinguishability is @xmath126      just for completeness , here we wish to derive a duality relation for a two - slit experiment in the case where one defines path distinguishability based on uqsd .",
    "we define the distinguishability of two paths as the upper limit of ( [ pn ] ) for n=2 .",
    "the path distinguishability then reads @xmath127 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the probabilities of the particle to go through the first and the second slit , respectively .    by carrying out an analysis similar to the one earlier in this section ( essentially , putting @xmath128 in ( [ pattern ] ) and redefining some constants )",
    ", one can show that the distinguishability and fringe visibility , in the two - slit experiment , are bounded by @xmath129 the above relation is a simple wave - particle duality relation for a two - slit interference experiment where the beams may be unequal .",
    "it can be connected to englert s duality relation ( [ egy ] ) for the case @xmath130 . in englert",
    "s analysis , distinguishability is given by @xmath131 @xcite , which can be related to @xmath0 in ( [ d2e ] ) , for @xmath130 , by the relation @xmath132 if one plugs in the above form of @xmath0 in ( [ dnew ] ) , the latter reduces to @xmath133 , which is just englert s duality relation ( [ egy ] ) .",
    "the new relation ( [ dnew ] ) appears to be more versatile for two - slit experiments , because it also applies to certain modified two - slit experiments in which the which - path detector is replaced by a  quantum device \" @xcite .",
    "lastly we discuss a particular scenario in which the two states of the which - path detector are identical , namely @xmath134 .",
    "in such a situation , experimentally one can not tell which slit the particle went through .",
    "however , if the probabilities of the particle for going through the two slits are known to be different , one can _ predict _ which slit the particle is most likely to have gone through . in this situation our @xmath0 , given by ( [ d2e ] ) ,",
    "is reduced to @xmath135 interestingly the above reduced distinguishability is related to the _ predictability _ , defined by greenberger and yasin @xcite as @xmath136 , by the following relation @xmath137 so , for the case @xmath134 , our new duality relation ( [ dnew ] ) reduces to @xmath138 which is precisely the duality relation derived by greenberger and yasin @xcite .",

    "consequently , it is the maximum probability with which one can _ unambiguously _ tell which slit the particle went through .",
