    "the knowledge of expected angular distribution of integral flux of atmospheric muons deep underwater is of interest not only for cosmic ray physics but also for the estimation of the possible background for neutrino detection and at last for a test of the correctness of underwater telescope data interpretation using the natural flux of atmospheric muons as calibration source .",
    "the last item frequently implies the estimation with an appropriate accuracy ( e.g. , better than 5@xmath1 for a given sea level spectrum ) the underwater integral muon flux for various sets of depths , cutoff energies and angular bins especially for telescopes of big spacial dimensions .    up to now the presentation of the results of calculations of muon propagation through thick layers of water",
    "both for parent muon sea level spectra ( especially for angular dependence taking into account the sphericity of atmosphere ) and for underwater angular flux has not been quite convenient when applied to concrete underwater arrays .",
    "in addition , a part of numerical results is available only in data tables ( often insufficient for accurate interpolation ) and figures .",
    "the possibility of direct implementation of monte carlo methods depends on the availability of corresponding codes and usually assumes rather long computations and accurate choice of the grid for simulation parameters to avoid big systematic errors .",
    "therefore , there remains the necessity of analytical expressions for underwater muon integral flux .",
    "in addition , the possibility of reconstructing the parameters of a sea level spectrum by fitting measured underwater flux in the case of their direct relation looks rather attractive .",
    "in this paper we present rather simple method allowing one to analytically calculate the angular distribution of integral muon flux deep under water for cutoff energies ( 1@xmath2gev and slant depths of ( 116)@xmath3 km for conventional ( @xmath0 ) sea level atmospheric muon spectra fitted by means of five parameters .",
    "the fluctuations of muon energy losses are taken into account .",
    "the possibility of reconstructing two parameters of sea level spectrum by fitting measured underwater angular intensity is shown for baikal neutrino telescope nt36 experimental data .",
    "according to the approach of work  @xcite the analytical expression for calculations of underwater angular integral flux above cutoff energy @xmath4 for a slant depth @xmath5 seen at vertical depth @xmath6 at zenith angle @xmath7 and allowing for the fluctuations of energy loss is based on the relation @xmath8 where correction factor @xmath9 is expressed , by definition , by the ratio of theoretical integral flux calculated in the continuous loss approximation to that calculated by exact monte carlo , and @xmath10 is the angular flux based on continuous energy losses .    in principle",
    ", the correction factor @xmath9 can be calculated using known codes for muon propagation through matter . in this work",
    "we apply for this aim the mum code described in work  @xcite .",
    "the values of correction factors calculated for the same slant depth @xmath11 at vertical direction and at zenith angle @xmath7 differ weakly .",

    "it appears that with acceptable accuracy the correction factor depends on slant depth @xmath11 only , rather than on @xmath11 and @xmath7 separately .",
    "the dependencies of correction factor on @xmath4 and @xmath11 , calculated for sea level spectrum given by expression  ( 6 ) below represent the set of rather smooth curves ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf_bk ] ) and it is possible to approximate this factor by formula @xmath15 here cut - off energy @xmath4 is expressed in ( gev ) and slant depth @xmath11 is in ( km ) with the coefficients @xmath16 collected in table  [ tab : cftab ] . when using  ( [ cf ] ) for cutoff energies @xmath1710 gev one should substitute value of @xmath4=10 gev .",
    "formula  ( [ cf ] ) can be applied for any geometrical shape of the surface .",
    "right hand side of  ( [ cf ] ) depends on @xmath7 because , generally , @xmath18 .",
    "so , in the particular case of a flat surface the angular dependence of the correction factor appears , in our approximation , only through the relation @xmath19  ( where @xmath6 is a vertical depth ) .    the accuracy of formula  ( [ cf ] ) for @xmath4=(1100)@xmath3gev is better than @xmath20 for slant depths @xmath11",
