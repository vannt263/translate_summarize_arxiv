    "observations of the gaseous halos surrounding galaxies  the circumgalactic medium ( cgm)allow us to constrain two of the most poorly understood aspects of galaxy formation : galactic - scale winds and gas accretion onto galaxies . detecting this gas in emission at high redshift is possible , but only in extreme environments or with very deep observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the diffuse gas comprising galactic - scale winds and accreting gas can be relatively easily measured as rest - frame uv absorption features however , which are imprinted on the spectrum of the galaxy itself ( ` down - the - barrel ' ) , or on a background qso at a small impact parameter from the galaxy .",

    "the characteristic sizes we derive for these clouds ( table  [ t_par ] ) are very small : @xmath156@xmath157  pc .",
    "these sizes are robust to modelling uncertainties , and include uncertainties in the ionizing field normalisation .",
    "such small sizes have important implications for the propagation of these clouds through the cgm , and for numerical simulations of the cgm .      in the discussion of the outflow model we made extensive comparison between the cool gas absorption we see at @xmath158  kpc to the cool gas that is seen in low - ion outflows ` down - the - barrel ' , in absorption against individual and stacked galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "our favoured outflow picture sees these cool , metal - enriched clumps travelling through hot , virialized gas already in the halo .",
    "therefore , we expect these clouds to be disrupted by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities on a timescale @xmath159 for a spherical clump of radius @xmath160 and density @xmath161 , travelling at @xmath162  @xmath8  through a halo with density @xmath163(e.g . * ? ? ?",

    "we have assumed a cloud - halo density contrast of 10 , but the timescale only weakly depends on this value .",
    "this timescale is more than an order of magnitude shorter than the 0.2 gyr required for the cloud to travel @xmath164  kpc from the galaxy .",
    "if these clumps were produced in an outflow , how then can they have travelled more than 50 kpc from the galaxy without being destroyed ?",
    "we consider three possible solutions .",
    "first , there may not be any existing hot gas halo .",
    "if this is a low mass galaxy ( @xmath165@xmath86 ) , then a shock may not yet have formed and halo gas may not be at the virial temperature @xcite .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that the halo is completely free of any gas , and the zoomed simulations of @xcite suggest that some hot cgm gas is in place by @xmath166 , even in @xmath167@xmath86  halos .",
    "the ovi  gas we see also suggests a hot halo is present .",
    "therefore this explanation seems unlikely .",
    "a second possibility is that the cool gas does not actually traverse the distance from the galaxy to its current location in the cgm .",
    "instead it condenses just behind a shock front driven by hot gas in the outflow once the temperature of the front drops enough for radiative cooling to become efficient , as outlined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their section 5.2 ) .",
    "this scenario can also explain the ovi  absorption as cooling gas found behind the shock front .    finally , there may be a mechanism that makes the clumps resistant to hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "such mechanisms have been explored to explain the apparent longevity of hvcs in the milky way halo , which share many characteristics with the absorbers we analyse : they are small , cool clouds moving through a hotter halo .",
    "confinement by magnetic fields is one possibility with some observational support ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of magnetic fields on clouds remains unclear , however , and some simulations suggest they may even hasten cloud disruption @xcite , or strongly suppress the relative velocity between the cloud and surrounding ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the mechanism favoured by @xcite for extending the lifetimes of hvcs is the presence of a warm envelope around the cool clouds ( observed as ovi  absorption around the hvcs ) that significantly extends its lifetime .",
    "it does this by minimizing both the temperature and velocity gradients between the cloud and the halo , making it resistant to instabilities .",
    "we also see ovi  in this absorber that is likely caused by a warm gas envelope around the clumps , so this is a plausible explanation .    to our knowledge , numerical simulations have not yet been performed to test whether such a warm envelope can indeed extend the cloud lifetime by the necessary amount .",

    "such small sizes are also found at low redshift : hvcs , with similar @xmath16  to lls , have sizes @xmath175  pc @xcite inferred from  21 cm images , and photoionization modelling of gas around @xmath176 galaxies @xcite , of @xmath177 llss @xcite and of weak  systems @xcite also yields small sizes",
    ". therefore these small clump sizes are a generic feature of both the high and low redshift cgm .",

    "however , there is no evidence that this is the case for the absorbers we see : the  component velocities are extremely well - aligned with the low ions ( see fig .  [ f_abs ] ) , and the photoionization models effectively reproduce the observed column densities of both metals and .      what are the requirements to resolve the hydrodynamic instabilities affecting these clouds ?",
    "the situation is comparable to the ` blob test ' performed by @xcite , where a test case of a dense spherical clump of gas travelling through a diffuse medium is considered using both adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",
    "agertz et al .",
    "find that 7 adaptive mesh resolution elements per cloud radius are needed to begin resolving the hydrodynamic instabilities which destroy the clump .",
    "we adopt an optimistic minimum requirement of 3 resolution elements per clump radius . assuming a radius of 400  proper pc  at the upper end of our measured sizes  this implies a minimum cell size of 140 pc .",

    "we conclude that to date , no single - galaxy or cosmological simulation has been performed at a sufficient resolution to predict the properties of low - ion gas in the cgm .",
    "the best approach for future simulations may be to abandon the attempt to resolve these gas clumps altogether .",
    "instead a sub - grid model for their behaviour could be introduced , in the same way that sub - grid models are used to treat star formation and galactic - scale outflows in these simulations .",
    "we have serendipitously discovered a faint , @xmath194 , galaxy at @xmath82 that is at a small impact parameter ( @xmath158  kpc ) from a background qso . based on similarities to galaxies selected as @xmath1  emitters",

    "2 .   infalling or tidally stripped gas is unlikely to explain all of the absorption , due to the large velocity width and large covering fraction of the gas .",

    "if most of the gas we see is in an outflow , the mass outflow rate implied is @xmath199 with a factor of @xmath200 uncertainty due to an unknown outflow geometry .",

    "it must be produced by a different gas phase that is physically associated with the photoionized gas .",
    "this phase may be explained by a warmer , possibly radiatively cooling , envelope around the cooler , photoionized gas .",
    "the total gas mass in the @xmath198  k , photoionized phase and the different phase traced by ovi  is comparable .",
    "together they imply a baryonic mass @xmath205 in the galaxy s cgm",
    ". the mass could be much higher if the halo extends further than 50  kpc , the covering fraction of gas is larger than 50% , or if we use less conservative assumptions about the ovi  fraction and metallicity .",
    "the photoionized clumps have sizes ranging from @xmath156@xmath157 pc .",
    "the uncertainties in these size estimates take into account uncertainties in the shape and normalisation of the uv background radiation .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz instabilities imply that the lifetime of clumps this size moving through a more diffuse halo are very short .",
    "therefore , we suggest that there must be a mechanism present to make the clumps resistant to these instabilities , such as a warm gas envelope surrounding them .",
    "the ovi  absorption may be produced by such an envelope .",
    "the small clump size makes them very difficult to resolve in numerical simulations .",
