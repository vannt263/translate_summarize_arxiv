    "<S> an approach to general relativity based on conformal flatness and quasiequilibrium ( cfqe ) assumptions has played an important role in the study of the inspiral dynamics and in providing initial data for fully general relativistic numerical simulations of coalescing compact binaries . however , the regime of validity of the approach has never been established . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we develop an analysis that determines the violation of the cfqe approximation in the evolution of the binary described by the full einstein theory . with this analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the cfqe assumption is significantly violated even at relatively large orbital separations in the case of corotational neutron star binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) determined in the cfqe approach for corotating neutron star binaries may have no astrophysical significance .    </S>",

    "<S> the importance of studying binary neutron star coalescence is rooted in observational astronomy ; the process is considered to be a candidate for the sources of detectable gravitational waves as well as @xmath0- and @xmath1-rays . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been a large effort expended towards numerically simulating the inspiral and coalescence of compact objects in order to determine their signature gravitational waveforms in preparation for the detection of gravitational waves by the new generation of gravitational wave observatories , including ligo , lisa , virgo , tama , and geo . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the nonlinear einstein field equations , the lack of exact symmetry of the system , and the coupling of different timescales in the process combine to make the study of the neutron star inspiral coalescence a major challenge .    a recent approach used to investigate the inspiral coalescence problem that has drawn much attention  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is based on the separation of two timescales , namely , the orbital motion timescale and the gravitational radiation timescale . </S>",
    "<S> this approach , which we refer to as the conformally flat quasiequilibrium ( cfqe ) approach , seeks to construct general relativistic configurations corresponding to two compact objects in circular orbit by assuming that the spacetime is essentially stationary with an approximate killing vector ( quasiequilibrium , qe ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slow secular evolution is driven by the gravitational radiation which has a much longer timescale than the orbital motion timescale , so that the spacetime is thought to be describable by a conformally flat ( cf ) spatial metric .    </S>",
    "<S> the cfqe approach leads to a two - phase description of the inspiral and coalescence process . in the `` slowly inspiraling phase '' , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is approximated by a time sequence ( which we refer to as a cfqe - sequence ) of cfqe configurations with the same rest mass and spin state ( e.g. corotating or nonrotating ) . </S>",
    "<S> each cfqe configuration in the time sequence is obtained by solving the four constraint equations plus one of the dynamical einstein equations under the cf and qe assumptions ( the qe assumption affects the constraint equations only indirectly ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inspiral is assumed to proceed along the sequence in a quasistationary manner on a timescale much longer than the orbital timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the slow secular evolution is driven by gravitational radiation , which can be calculated using e.g. , the standard quadrupole formula ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the corotating case , </S>",
    "<S> when the orbit shrinks to a certain radius ( which will depend on the equation of state ( eos ) of the neutron stars ) , the cfqe configuration becomes secularly unstable , with the adm mass of the system attaining a minimum among all configurations in the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the orbit at this radius is referred to as the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . </S>",
    "<S> one expects the binary to become dynamically unstable at an orbital radius that is slightly less than this isco point . </S>",
    "<S> this isco point is therefore thought to be the point at which the system enters the `` plunge phase '' , in which the subsequent merging occurs within an orbital timescale .    besides providing a description of the inspiral coalescence process </S>",
    "<S> , the cfqe approach is important for another reason : it is expected to provide a starting point for numerical investigations in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the setting of initial data is a sensitive issue in the numerical integration of the einstein equations . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> astrophysically relevant initial data must be used in order to make contact with gravitational wave observations . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we are forced to use initial data in the late state of the inspiral , due to limited computational resources . </S>",
    "<S> as the cfqe approach gives configurations that satisfy the constraint equations of the einstein theory , one is tempted to start numerical integration with a cfqe configuration near the isco point as determined in the cfqe approach , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the danger in using the cfqe approach to determine the initial configuration for numerical integration is the unknown astrophysical relevance of the initial data , regardless of the fact that each cfqe configuration satisfies the constraints of general relativity and is therefore , in principle , a legitimate initial data set for numerical integrations . in order for the results of the numerical evolutions to be relevant to observations , e.g. , the gravitational waves emitted in neutron star coalescences , we have to make sure that the initial data actually corresponds to a configuration in a realistic inspiral . </S>",
    "<S> the setting of physical initial data is a standard difficulty in numerical relativity and it is particularly acute in this case ; if the initial data is picked to be a cfqe configuration in a regime where the cfqe - sequence is _ not _ expected to be valid , the initial data must be regarded as highly contrived and the resulting calculation will have no astrophysical significance .    in this paper we analyze the limitations of the cfqe approach , which suffers from two basic problems . </S>",
    "<S> the first problem is that the cf and qe assumptions violate the einstein equations which , for this system , forbid both an exact killing vector and a conformally flat metric at all times ( the metric can only be chosen to be conformally flat at _ one _ point in time but not along the entire time sequence ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second problem is that the cfqe approach itself does not provide a way to estimate the error involved in its assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> a determination of its accuracy has to be carried out with a completely different analysis . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , the regime of validity of the cfqe approach has never been determined . here </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the rate of increase of the accuracy of the cf and qe approximations with increasing initial neutron star separation . for </S>",
    "<S> the corotating binaries studied ( with a @xmath2 polytropic equation of state ) , we demonstrate that an initial separation of at least @xmath3 neutron star radii is needed in order for the violation of the qe assumption to remain below @xmath4 ( in some reasonable measure defined below ) after a short evolution ( a fraction of an orbit ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( the violation of the cf assumption is an order of magnitude smaller at this separation . ) </S>",
    "<S> it is safe to conclude that , starting at a separation of @xmath3 neutron star radii , the evolution ( e.g. , the orbital phase ) of the system is completely different from that of the cfqe - sequence well before the cfqe isco separation ( less than @xmath5 neutron star radii ) is reached .    in what follows , we present the results of our analysis of the cfqe - sequence approximation for binary , corotating neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the details of all calculations and the subsequent analysis of the numerical results , along with results on long timescale ( e.g. , multiple orbital period timescale ) numerical evolutions will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we measure the spatial separation on a constant time hypersurface by the spatial geodesic distance @xmath19 between the points of maximum baryonic mass density in each of the neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> this particular choice of measure of distance depends on the choice of time slicing . in order to compare with the cfqe - sequence approximation in an invariant manner </S>",

    "<S> these results are in contrast to the cfqe - sequence approximation , where @xmath42 is exactly zero . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid growth of @xmath42 to such a large value signals that , in the present case of corotating neutron stars , after just a short time the cfqe - sequence is very different from the spacetime described by the full einstein equations even when the latter is started with the same initial data . within a small fraction of an orbit , </S>",

    "<S> we can see that , e.g. , one would have to use a cfqe configuration initial data set with a geodesic separation between the neutron stars of about @xmath55 in order for the subsequent solution to have the fluid 4-velocity following a killing vector to the @xmath4 level .

    "<S> again we begin with an invariant construction of a measure of the violation . because conformal flatness is a property of a constant time slice , and because we are using the same slicing conditions in our simulation as that used in the cfqe - sequence approximation , we seek a 3-invariant ( with respect to spatial coordinate transformations ) to monitor the cf assumption . </S>",
