    "while phenomenological models with low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) are arguably the best candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , they typically include a large number of parameters associated with the soft supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "for example , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which has two higgs doublets and conserved r - parity , contains 105 new parameters @xcite , including the bilinear higgs superpotential parameter @xmath1 and the soft susy breaking parameters ( this counting does not include the gravitino mass and coupling ) .",
    "the parameter count generically increases if such susy models are extended beyond the minimal gauge structure and particle content of the mssm ( unless symmetry relations exist in the theory which relate subsets of parameters ) .",
    "many of these new parameters are phases , which both provide new sources of cp violation and modify the amplitudes for cp - conserving processes . even if certain sectors of the theory exhibit no cp violation at tree level ( e.g. if the relevant phases can be eliminated by global phase rotations ) , the phases can leak into such sectors of the theory at the loop level and have an impact on collider phenomenology and cosmology .",
    "in contrast to the sm , in which the only source of cp violation is present in the ckm matrix and thus is intimately tied to flavor physics , cp - violating phases within susy models can occur in both flavor - conserving and flavor - changing couplings .",
    "the phases of the flavor - conserving couplings ( which have no analogue in the sm ) are of particular interest because they can have significant phenomenological implications which can be studied without knowledge of the origin of intergenerational mixing . in the mssm ,",
    "these phases are given by reparameterization invariant combinations of the phases of the gaugino mass parameters @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , the trilinear couplings @xmath9 , the @xmath1 parameter , and the higgs bilinear coupling @xmath10 .",
    "however , not all of these phases are physical ; after utilizing the @xmath11 and @xmath12 global symmetries of the mssm , the reparameterization invariant phase combinations are @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( in self - evident notation ) .",
    "such phases have traditionally been assumed to be small due to what is known as the supersymmetric cp problem : the experimental upper limits on the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , neutron , and certain atoms individually constrain the phases to be less than @xmath15 ( for sparticle masses consistent with naturalness ) @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that edm bounds can be satisfied without requiring all reparameterization invariant phase combinations to be small , if either ( i ) certain cancellations exist between different edm contributions @xcite , or ( iii ) the sparticles of the first and second families have multi - tev masses @xcite .",
    "( the ratio of electroweak higgs vevs ) is large .",
    "not only are cancellations in the one - loop edms more difficult to achieve , but certain two - loop contributions are then enhanced @xcite which do not decouple when the sfermions are heavy . in part for this reason , we will restrict our attention in this paper to the small @xmath16 regime . ] even within each of these scenarios , the particularly strong constraints arising from the atomic edms @xcite lead to a general upper bound of @xmath17 on the reparameterization invariant phase present in the chargino sector ( @xmath18 in our notation ) , while the other phases are comparatively unconstrained @xcite .",
    "these constraints will be discussed in detail later in the paper ; for now , it is worth noting that this  cp hierarchy problem \" is an intriguing issue to be addressed within models of the soft parameters which include cp violation .    of course , if the reparameterization invariant phases are sizeable , they can have important phenomenological consequences . within the mssm ,",
    "one of the examples in which these phases can have a significant impact is the higgs sector .",
    "as is well known , the mssm higgs sector conserves cp at tree level .",
    "however , radiative corrections involving the sm fields and their superpartners ( with the dominant effects typically due to top and stop loops ) have a substantial impact on higgs masses and mixings .",
    "for example , the one - loop radiative corrections substantially elevate the tree - level theoretical upper bound of @xmath19 on the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xcite ; these results have been improved by utilizing complete one - loop on - shell renormalization@xcite , renormalization group methods @xcite , diagrammatic methods with leading order qcd corrections @xcite , two - loop on - shell renormalization @xcite , and complete two - loop effective potential @xcite . indeed , if the radiative corrections include a nontrivial dependence on phases , the higgs potential violates cp explicitly at one - loop .",
    "the higgs mass eigenstates then no longer have definite cp properties , which leads to important implications for higgs production and decay @xcite .",
    "the mssm offers a minimal framework for stabilizing the higgs sector against quadratic divergences .",
    "however , it is well known that the mssm has a hierarchy problem with respect to the scale of the superpotential @xmath1 parameter @xcite , which has a natural scale of @xmath20 , and the electroweak scale .",
    "an elegant framework in which to address this  @xmath1 problem \" is to generate the @xmath1 parameter via the the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a sm singlet @xmath2 .",
    "one simple possibility parameter can also be generated in models with no additional gauge groups , _",
    "i.e. _ the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )",
    ". however , nmssm models generically possess discrete vacua and the tensions of the walls separating them are too large to be cosmologically admissable @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite is to invoke an additional nonanomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry broken at the tev scale , as expected in many string models . for suitable @xmath0 charges ,",
    "the bare @xmath1 parameter is forbidden but the operator @xmath21 is allowed , such that an effective @xmath1 term is generated after @xmath2 develops a vev of order the electroweak / tev scale ( assuming the yukawa coupling @xmath22 , as is well - motivated within semirealistic superstring models ) .",
    "this framework is of particular interest because such extra @xmath23 groups are often present in plausible extensions of the mssm , and in fact are ubiquitous within many classes of four - dimensional superstring models .",
    "indeed , additional nonanomalous @xmath23 gauge groups are present in virtually all known 4d string models with semirealistic features , such as gauge structure which includes @xmath24 ( or a viable gut extension ) and particle content which includes the mssm fields.s are always present at the string scale . whether or not all of these @xmath23s persist to the tev scale depends on the details of the vacuum restabilization procedure .",
    "although there are cases in which only the mssm gauge structure remains at low energy @xcite , typically one or more extra @xmath23s persists to the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "additional @xmath23s also are generic in supersymmetric braneworld models derived from type ii string orientifolds @xcite ( due at least in part to the @xmath25 gauge groups associated with a stacks of d branes ) .",
    "phenomenological analyses also indicate that typically extra @xmath23s are present in the low energy theory and broken at the electroweak / tev scale @xcite . ]    within this class of models , the electroweak and @xmath0 symmetry breaking is driven by the soft susy breaking parameters , and hence the @xmath26 mass is expected to be of order a few tev or less .",
    "such a @xmath26 should be easily observable at either present or forthcoming colliders . indeed , the nonobservation to date of a @xmath26 puts interesting but stringent limits on the @xmath26 mass and mixing with the ordinary @xmath27 both from direct searches at the tevatron @xcite and indirect tests from precision electroweak measurements @xcite .",
    "although limits depend on the details of the @xmath26 couplings , typically @xmath28 gev and the @xmath29 mixing angle @xmath30 .",
    "mass arises from cosmology if the @xmath0 gauge symmetry forbids the standard implementation of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses . in such scenarios ,",
    "the right - handed neutrinos may be light , and bbn constraints then require model - dependent limits that in some cases are as strong as @xmath31 tev @xcite . ]",
    "these models have been analyzed at tree level in @xcite , where it was found that there are corners of parameter space in which an acceptable @xmath29 hierarchy can be achieved .",
    "further studies of a different class of string - motivated @xmath0 models can be found in @xcite .    as the phase of the @xmath1 parameter filters into the amplitudes for many physical observables in the mssm ( and plays an important role in the higgs sector at one - loop ) , it is worthwhile to analyze models which solve the @xmath1 problem in the presence of explicit cp violation . in this paper , we thus study the supersymmetric cp problem in @xmath0 models , focusing on the radiative corrections to the higgs sector of the @xmath0 model of @xcite in the case that the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters have general cp - violating phases ( radiative corrections in the cp - conserving case has been studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by classifying the reparameterization invariant phase combinations and comment on the phenomenological constraints on these phases from edm bounds .",
    "we then turn to the higgs sector , which conserves cp at tree level , but phases enter the higgs potential through the stop mass - squared matrix at one - loop ( just as in the mssm ) .",
    "the vev s of the electroweak higgs doublets @xmath32 and singlet @xmath2 are then determined by minimizing the loop - corrected higgs potential . within this framework ,",
    "an effective @xmath1 parameter of the correct magnitude is generated which also has a phase governed by the phases of the soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "we study the pattern of higgs masses and mixings including the edm and @xmath26 constraints , and discuss the phenomenological implications for higgs searches .",
    "we study the class of @xmath0 models of @xcite , in which the gauge group is extended to @xmath33 with gauge couplings @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the matter content includes the mssm superfields and a sm singlet @xmath2 , which are all generically assumed to be charged under the additional @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "explicitly , the particle content is : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 is the family index .",
    "charges are family nonuniversal they provide a tree - level source of fcnc .",
    "phenomenological bounds thus dictate that the charges of the first and second families should be identical to avoid overproduction of fcnc without fine - tuning @xcite . ]",
    "the superpotential includes a yukawa coupling of the two electroweak higgs doublets @xmath32 to the singlet @xmath2 , as well as a top quark yukawa coupling : @xmath44 gauge invariance of @xmath45 under @xmath0 requires that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this choice of charges not only forbids the  bare \" @xmath1 parameter but also a khler potential coupling of the form @xmath48 required for the giudice - masiero mechanism @xcite ( the khler potential is otherwise assumed to be of canonical form ) .",
    "charges unspecified because our aim is not to construct a specific model . in an explicit model",
    "there will be additional constraints on the @xmath0 charges ( e.g from anomaly cancellation ) .",
    "we also do not consider kinetic mixing in the analysis @xcite .",
    "however , even if kinetic mixing is absent at tree level will be generated through 1-loop rg running if @xmath49 @xcite . ]",
    "the form of ( [ superpot ] ) is motivated by string models in which a given higgs doublet only has @xmath50 yukawa couplings to a single ( third ) family .",
    "we will consider the small @xmath51 regime only such as @xmath52 are allowed ( this region is excluded in the mssm ) .",
    "the reason is that the higgs bosons are generically heavier in @xmath0 models ( as in the nmssm and other models with extended higgs sectors ) , and even at tree level the lightest higgs boson can easily escape lep bounds . ] such that the yukawa couplings of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be safely neglected .",
    "the origin of the yukawa couplings of the first and second generations of quarks and leptons is not addressed .",
    "as we are primarily interested in the third family , we shall suppress the family index in what follows .",
    "the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters include gaugino masses @xmath7 ( @xmath55 ) , trilinear couplings @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and soft mass - squared parameters @xmath58 : @xmath59 these soft susy breaking parameters are generically nonuniversal at low energies .",
    "we do not address the origin of these low energy parameters via rg evolution from high energy boundary conditions in this paper .",
    "the gaugino masses @xmath7 and soft trilinear couplings @xmath60 of ( [ soft ] ) can be complex ; if so , they can provide sources of cp violation ( without loss of generality , the yukawa couplings @xmath61 can be assumed to be real ) .",
    "however , not all of these phases are physical , just as the case in the mssm .",
    "let us first consider the mssm .",
    "the reparameterization invariant combinations of phases in the mssm are easily determined by forming invariants with respect to the global u(1)@xmath62 and u(1)@xmath63 symmetries present in the limit that the soft breaking parameters and the @xmath1 term are set to zero @xcite ; for reference , the @xmath64 charge assignments are presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a convenient basis of the resulting reparameterization invariant phases thus is @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which enter the mass matrices of the sfermions and the gauginos / higgsinos , respectively .",
    "an analysis of the mssm tree level higgs sector also suggests it is useful to exploit u(1)@xmath62 to set @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is then dropped from the invariants above ) , in which case the higgs vevs are real .",

    "gauge symmetry breaking is driven by the vevs of the electroweak higgs doublets @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath69 and the singlet @xmath2 .",
    "the tree level higgs potential is a sum of f terms , d terms , and soft supersymmetry breaking terms : @xmath70 in which @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the gut normalized hypercharge coupling .    at the minimum of the potential ,",

    "since gauge invariance dictates that only the phase of the combination @xmath83 enters the potential , we can assume that the vevs of @xmath32 are real and attach a phase only to @xmath2 without loss of generality ( this choice is also consistent with our assignment of @xmath12 charges in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the effective @xmath1 parameter is generated by the singlet vev @xmath82 : @xmath84 the only complex parameter which enters the higgs potential at tree level is @xmath56 .",
    "however , the global phases of the higgs fields ( more precisely , of the combination @xmath85 ) can always be chosen to absorb the phase @xmath86 of @xmath56 by performing a @xmath12 rotation on the fields , such that @xmath56 and the vev s can all be taken to be real without loss of generality @xcite . to state this another way , the minimization conditions with respect to the cp odd directions @xmath87 all lead to the condition @xmath88 such that @xmath89 at tree level . with this condition , the higgs sector is cp conserving .",

    "however , it is possible to make a stronger statement : unlike the mssm , the higgs potential in this class of @xmath0 models does not allow for cp violation at the renormalizable level at any order in perturbation theory . to see this more clearly , consider the most general renormalizable higgs potential for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath2 .",

    "as the higgs potential conserves cp to all orders at the renormalizable level , cp violation can enter the theory only through loop - induced nonrenormalizable operators .",
    "the form of ( [ colemanweinberg ] ) demonstrates that the one - loop contributions to the higgs potential include an infinite series of terms involving powers of the higgs fields .",
    "while these terms include contributions to the potential at the renormalizable level , they also include a tower of nonrenormalizable terms , such as @xmath215 in which @xmath216 denotes a typical sfermion mass .",

    "the first term renormalizes the @xmath226 operator in the tree level potential , while the second term is a new higher - dimensional operator .",
    "both terms violate cp through the phase of @xmath227 ( recall this phase is irremovable if @xmath57 and @xmath56 have a nontrivial relative phase @xmath228 ) .",
    "the effective theory at scales below @xmath229 is equivalent to the mssm ( with @xmath1 and @xmath200 parameters related to the other soft parameters of the model ) .",
    "one concludes from ( [ deltavp ] ) that the size of the cp violation in the higgs sector depends on the extent to which the @xmath0 breaking scale is split from the electroweak scale .",
    "indeed , below the scale @xmath229 , the coefficients of the cp - violating effective operators in ( [ 2hdm ] ) grow with @xmath230 ( or equivalently @xmath231 ) , in agreement with the cp - violating @xmath232 entries of the higgs mass - squared matrix .",
    "in this section we discuss the existing constraints on @xmath0 models as well as their phenomenological implications with explicit cp violation .      in the previous section , we computed the radiatively corrected higgs boson mass - squared matrix ( [ higgsmassmat ] ) .",
    "if the eigenvalues of the higgs mass - squared are all positive definite , the parameter space under concern corresponds to a minimum of the potential .",
    "the parameter space is of course also constrained by the fact that direct collider searches have yielded lower bounds on the sparticle and higgs masses",

    "this can happen in models in which there are several additional singlets in a secluded sector coupled to the higgs fields @xmath32 and @xmath2 via the gauge or gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these large trilinear coupling scenarios ( with light @xmath26 bosons ) also have interesting implications for baryogenesis , due to the first order phase transition at tree level .",
    "if the phase transition remains first order after radiative corrections are included , then @xmath250 may be sufficient to generate the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the electroweak phase transition in @xmath26 models with a secluded sector is strongly first order ( with a heavy enough @xmath26 without any fine - tuning ) , and electroweak baryogenesis in such models can be viable in a greater region of parameter space than in the minimal model @xcite . ] in this case @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 is of order @xmath254 ( the precise factor depends on the size of @xmath255 ) .",
    "however , the collider constraints on such a light @xmath26 are severe within typical models , and hence it can be accommodated in the spectrum only if it is sufficiently leptophobic .",

    "first , the @xmath29 mixing can be kept small enough with less fine - tuning of the @xmath240 in ( [ mzzp ] ) ; in particular , @xmath248 is no longer a requirement .",
    "in addition , the collider constraints are less severe for @xmath26 bosons with tev - scale masses in typical models ; for example , leptophobic couplings are not generically a phenomenological necessity .",
    "let us now turn to dipole moment constraints .",
    "recall in susy theories dipole moments of the fundamental fermions are generated by gaugino / higgsino exchanges accompanied by sfermions of the appropriate flavor .",
    "the dipole moment under concern may ( e.g. the electric and chromoelectric dipole moments of the quarks ) or may not ( e.g. the anomalous magnetic moment of muon ) require explicit sources of cp violation .    in the mssm , dipole moments can provide important constraints on the parameter space .",
    "for example , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is in principle an important observable either for discovering susy indirectly or constraining susy parameter space ; however , at present the theoretical uncertainties present in certain nonperturbative sm contributions lead to difficulties in carrying out this procedure using recent data ( see e.g. @xcite for a review of the basic physics and @xcite for the most recent experimental results ) . at present ,",
    "the most stringent constraints arise from electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "as is well known , the experimental upper bounds on the edms of the electron , neutron , and certain atoms impose particularly severe constraints on the parameter space of general susy models .",
    "in contrast to the sm , in which edms are generated only at three - loop order ( as the only source of cp violation is in the ckm matrix ) , the sources of explicit cp violation in susy theories include phases in flavor - conserving couplings which , if present , lead to nonvanishing one - loop contributions to the edms which can exceed the experimental bounds . as these phases generically filter into the higgs sector",
    ", it is important to include the parameter space constraints provided by the edm bounds .",
    "let us consider the dipole moments which arise within this class of @xmath0 models .",
    "after replacing the @xmath1 parameter of the mssm by @xmath94 in ( [ mupar ] ) , all one - loop dipole moments are found to be identical to their mssm counterparts except for an additional contribution generated by the @xmath265@xmath266 diagram in fig.[fig0 ] .",

    "clearly , the ( chromo-)electric and ( chromo-)magnetic dipole moments are generated , respectively , by @xmath272 $ ] and @xmath273 $ ] .",
    "the expression above is approximate estimate ( valid in the limit that @xmath274 ) of the exact amplitude ; a more precise treatment would take into account the mixing of all six neutral fermions .",
    "the amplitude ( [ df ] ) is similar to the bino exchange contribution in the mssm .    within the aforementioned light @xmath26 scenario , for phenomenologically viable models @xmath275",
    "vanishes because the lepton couplings to the @xmath26 are necessarily leptophobic .",
    "therefore , for instance , the electron edm is completely decoupled from the presence of an electroweak scale @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this conclusion extends to other leptons for family universal @xmath26 models .",
    "this may also be relevant for the hadronic dipole moments depending on whether or not the @xmath26 boson is hadrophobic ( assuming it is detected in present and/or forthcoming colliders ) . as @xmath276 within the light @xmath26 scenario ,",
    "the dipole moments of both the up - type and down - type fermions are largely controlled by the corresponding @xmath277 parameters .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 charges are not necessarily suppressed for any fermion flavor in the heavy @xmath26 scenario and thus the @xmath278 contribution to dipole moments can compete with the mssm amplitudes . in this scenario , @xmath279 , and hence both terms in @xmath278",
    "are important .",
    "the dipole moments become sensitive to @xmath280 if the @xmath277 parameters are sufficiently small compared to @xmath177 .    as the dipole moments generically scale as @xmath281 , ( which is clear from the form of ( [ df ] ) ) , when @xmath282 the edms typically exceed the existing bounds by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude if the phases are @xmath50 . as discussed briefly in the introduction",
    ", one possibility is satisfying the experimental bounds while retaining @xmath50 phases is to raise @xmath271 to multi - tev values , which in effect requires the sfermions of first and second generations to be ultraheavy @xcite .",
    "another way of suppressing the edms is to invoke accidental cancellations between different contributions , _",
    "i.e. _ to find regions of parameter space in which the susy amplitudes interfere destructively . in the mssm with low values of @xmath16 ,",
    "this has been shown to occur with almost no costraint on any of the invariant phases except @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "this strong constraint follows from the fact that @xmath284 , and thus the @xmath4 gauginos dominate the edms . within the @xmath0 framework",
    ", the edm constraints can have varying implications depending on the size of ( [ df ] ) .    * if @xmath285 or ( more generally ) @xmath286 , the edm constraints on the parameter space are similar to that of the mssm except for a slight folding of the cancellation domain due to the inclusion of ( [ df ] ) .",
    "once again , the most strongly constrained phase is @xmath287 , with @xmath288 in the low @xmath16 regime .",
    "as @xmath289 and @xmath102 is a loop - suppressed angle ( [ theta ] ) , the edms provide a constraint on @xmath290 : @xmath291 .",
    "consequently , the dynamical solution to the @xmath1 problem present in this class of @xmath0 models also solves the susy cp hierarchy problem in specific models of the soft parameters in which ( at least ) the @xmath4 gaugino mass has the same phase as the @xmath56 parameter ( then @xmath292 by definition ) . ) , and hence we can not make any claims about how one solves the susy cp hierarchy problem within this framework .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note that models of the soft parameters in which the gaugino masses and @xmath95 terms have the same phases are quite common within various classes of four - dimensional string models ( at least at tree level ) under plausible assumptions @xcite . ] * if @xmath293 , the dipole moment amplitude @xmath278 becomes comparable to or larger than the @xmath4 gaugino contribution , and the cancellation domain found in the mssm will be significantly folded . in this case , the edms will constrain a combination of the phases in ( [ df ] ) and @xmath287 .",
    "such a scenario , however , can have tension with the standard picture of gauge coupling unification at a high fundamental scale ( although in principle it could be considered as a possibility in generic low scale realizations ) .    until this point ,",
    "we have only discussed one - loop edms .",
    "it was pointed out a while ago @xcite that in certain regions of mssm parameter space certain two - loop contribution contributions which exclusively depend on the third generation sfermions can be nonnegligible .",
    "these contributions , which are particularly relevant if the one - loop edms are suppressed solely by ultraheavy first and second generation sfermion masses , involve the same phases which predominantly filter into the higgs potential at one - loop ( _ i.e. _ the phases present in the stop mass - squared matrix ) .",
    "however , these two - loop edms become sizeable only at large @xmath16 . in this paper , we have restricted our attention to small @xmath16 values , which is a well - motivated parameter regime ( e.g. , @xmath52 is allowed within this framework , in contrast to the mssm ) .",
    "hence , these contributions will not provide significant parameter space constraints in our numerical analysis .      in this section , we present sample numerical calculations of the higgs boson masses and mixings derived in section 3.2 , taking into account the phenomenological constraints on the parameter space discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 .",
    "in the absence of cp violation , the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing terms of the higgs mass - squared matrix ( [ higgsmassmat ] ) vanish ( @xmath294 ) , and hence ( [ higgsmassmat ] ) takes on a block diagonal form .",
    "the structure of ( [ higgsmassmat ] ) demonstrates that in this limit there is one cp even scalar with mass @xmath295 and a cp odd scalar with mass proportional to @xmath296 .",
    "in addition , there is a light cp even scalar of mass @xmath297 and a heavier cp even scalar with its mass controlled by a combination of @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "however , in the presence of explicit cp violation , the higgs bosons cease to have definite cp parities .",
    "the strength of cp violation in the higgs sector is parameterized by the reparameterization invariant phase @xmath300 , which induces a nonvanishing @xmath250 through the relation ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "the induced phase @xmath102 is a loop - induced and scale - dependent quantity which is particularly enhanced in parameter regions with a low @xmath299 .    as discussed in section 4.2 , while the one - loop edm constraints strongly constrain the phase @xmath290 , this phase is not the dominant source of cp violation in the higgs sector for small values of @xmath16 and hence this constraint does not restrict the parameter space for our analysis .",
    "the dominant corrections to the higgs potential arise from top and stop loops , and the dipole moments of the fermions in first two generations feel such effects only at two loop level .",
    "in fact , in low @xmath16 limit ( which is the domain in which our analysis of the higgs potential is valid ) , such effects are completely negligible @xcite . therefore , the edm constraints do not have a direct impact on our analysis of cp violation in the higgs sector ( we simply assume that the dipole moment constraints have been saturated either via cancellations or by choosing the first and second generation sfermion masses heavy enough ; we could also simply assume that all phases except @xmath228 are small ) .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the parameter space , including the nontrivial constraints arising from @xmath29 mixing .",
    "the fundamental parameters relevant for the higgs sector include @xmath301 , @xmath302 @xmath303 @xmath304 @xmath305,@xmath306 , @xmath307 @xmath308 @xmath309 , @xmath310 .",

    ", at least a subset of the higgs masses within this class of @xmath0 models can be observable at forthcoming colliders and future colliders such as tesla and nlc .",
    "next generation of colliders such as tesla and nlc . within light @xmath26 models ,",
    "all of the higgs bosons remain light after including radiative corrections , but such models generically have very small cp - violating higgs couplings .",
    "in contrast , large @xmath26 models can have large cp - violating higgs couplings . as the viable regions of space typically correspond to the decoupling limit in which all of the higgs bosons except the lightest higgs are heavy , detecting the cp - violating effects within this scenario is similar to that within the mssm for a large @xmath1 parameter .",
    "such effects have been studied in @xcite , where it is known that higgs sector cp violation can introduce sizeable modifications in the couplings of the higgs bosons to fermions and vector bosons , and strongly affect the bounds inferred from the cp - conserving theory .",
    "furthermore , the cp purity of the higgs bosons ( assuming that the collider searches establish their existence ) can be tested by measuring cp violation in its decays into heavy quarks or vector bosons @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the nature and implications of explicit cp violating phases present in the soft breaking lagrangian within supersymmetric models with an additional @xmath23 gauge symmetry and an additional sm gauge singlet @xmath2 .",
    "this class of models is worthy of further study not only because such gauge extensions are ubiquitous within four - dimensional string models ( and other plausible extensions of the mssm ) , but also they provide an elegant framework in which the @xmath1 problem of the mssm . the solution , which is to forbid the bare @xmath1 term by @xmath0 gauge invariance and generate an effective @xmath1 parameter through the vev of the singlet @xmath2 , is similar to that found within the nmssm ( but its generic cosmological and cp problems ) .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * all reparameterization invariant phases can be expressed as linear combinations of @xmath370 and @xmath371 ( and hence a  natural \" basis can be obtained by using @xmath12 to set @xmath104 ) . *",
    "the higgs sector is manifestly cp conserving at tree level ( and indeed at renormalizable level to all orders in perturbation theory ) .",
    "however , the cp - violating phases present in the stop mass - squared matrix filter into the higgs sector at the nonrenormizalizable level at one - loop .",
    "the cp - violating effects are particularly enhanced when @xmath0 symmetry is broken near the sparticle thresholds . *",
    "the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry near the weak scale stabilizes not only the modulus of @xmath1 but also its phase .",
    "the phase of @xmath1 itself is of course not a basis - independent quantity ; however , in the ",
    "natural \" basis defined above , this phase ( @xmath250 in this basis ) arises only at the loop level and is typically @xmath346@xmath372 , depending on the size of @xmath299 ( the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass in the cp conserving limit ) . *",
    "the absence of permanent edms for leptons and hadrons ( even assuming either cancellations and/or heavy first and second generation sfermions ) strongly bound the reparameterization invariant phase present in the chargino mass matrix @xmath373 , while the other susy phases remain largely unconstrained . in specific models in which the phase difference between ( at least the @xmath4 ) gaugino mass parameters and @xmath56 is vanishingly small , this ",
    "susy cp hierarchy problem \" is resolved because the radiative phase @xmath250 is sufficiently small to be easily allowed by edm bounds . *",
    "the cp - violating effects in the higgs sector are quite distinct for the two phenomenologically viable scenarios with acceptably small @xmath29 mixing , because these effects are proprotional to the size of the effective @xmath1 term . in scenarios with a light @xmath26 ,",
    "cp - violating effects are suppressed , while heavy @xmath26 models can exhibit significant cp - violating scalar - pseudoscalar mixings , with phenomenological implications similar to that of the mssm with large @xmath1 parameter .",
