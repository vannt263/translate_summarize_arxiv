    "in the nlc  @xcite , the strong beam - beam interaction significantly distorts beam distribution at ip . this effect ,",
    "called disruption  @xcite , increases the beam emittance and angular divergence after collision and generates a huge energy spread in the outgoing beam .",
    "the nlc extraction line was designed to minimize particle loss caused by these effects  @xcite .",
    "so far , the nlc beam disruption and extraction line performance were studied for the ideal beam conditions at the ip . however , various incoming beam errors may affect the beam - beam interaction and the resultant disrupted distribution . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the effects of beam - to - beam transverse position and angular offsets at ip on the beam distribution and particle loss in the extraction line .",
    "beam - beam effects such as energy loss due to beamstrahlung occur as particles in each bunch go through the strong coherent field of the other bunch .",
    "when the beams are vertically flat , as they are in nlc , the beamstrahlung can be enhanced significantly for some vertical position and angle offsets , because the field seen by the bulk of the particles in one beam increases as the offset from the other beam increases .",
    "of course , the field seen by each beam eventually falls off when position offsets become large enough .",
    "the interaction is further complicated by the fact that the two beams distort each other s shape during the collision .",
    "thus we resort to numerical simulations , where care must be taken in choosing the grids to perform beam - beam calculations as accurately as possible .",
    "the beam parameters for the nlc design can be found in ref .",

    ", we used the stage 1 parameters where the center - of - mass energy is 500 gev ; the ip parameters listed in tables  1 and  2 , where @xmath0 is the beam emittance , @xmath1 the beam size , and @xmath2 angular divergence in the horizontal and vertical plane , respectively .",
    "the listed parameters are for ideal ip conditions and zero initial energy spread .",

    "as expected , tracking with the horizontal ip offsets showed no particle loss .",
    "more detailed analysis of the beam loss with @xmath11 offset revealed that all of the particles except one were lost in the vertical plane .",
    "this indicates that the blow up of vertical emittance may be the source of the particle loss .",
    "our expectation is that the power loss caused by ip offset , even at the maximum value of 0.7  kw , can be safely disposed . in practice , the losses should be much lower since the beam offset will be controlled at the level of @xmath12 for a maximum luminosity . we expect that with such control of the vertical offsets the power loss will be on the order of @xmath130.05  kw for the stage 1 parameters .",
    "disrupted beam distributions with angular offset at ip were generated in the guinea  pig code by changing the nominal initial angle at ip by @xmath14 or @xmath15 in the two beams .",
