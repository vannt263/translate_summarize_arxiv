    "in reliability engineering two crucial objectives are considered : ( 1 ) to maximize an estimate of system reliability and ( 2 ) to minimize the variance of the reliability estimate . because system designers and users are risk - averse",
    ", they generally prefer the second objective which leads to a system design with a slightly lower reliability estimate but a lower variance of that estimate , ( eg , @xcite ) .",
    "it provides decision makers efficient rules compared to other designs which have a higher system reliability estimate , but with a high variability of that estimate . in the case of",
    "parallel  series and/or by duality series ",
    "parallel systems , the variance of the reliability estimate can be lowered by allocation of a fixed sample size ( the number of observations or units tested in the system ) , while reliability estimate is obtained by testing components , see berry @xcite .",
    "allocation schemes for estimation with cost , see for example @xcite , lead generally to a discrete optimization problem which can be solved sequentially using adaptive designs in a fixed or a bayesian framework . based on a decision theoretic approach ,",
    "the authors seek to minimize either the variance or the bayes risk associated to a squared error loss function .",
    "the problem of optimal reliability estimation reduces to a problem of optimal allocation of the sample sizes between bernoulli populations .",
    "such problems can be solved _ via _ dynamic programming but this technique becomes costly and intractable for complex systems . in the case of a two components series or parallel system , optimal procedures can be obtained and solved analytically when the coefficients of variation of the associated bernoulli populations are known , cf .",
    "eg , @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the coefficients of variation are not known in practice since they depend themselves on the unknown components reliabilities of the system . in @xcite",
    ", the author has defined a sequential allocation scheme in the case of a series system and has shown its first order asymptotic optimality for large sample sizes with comparison to the balanced scheme . in @xcite , a reliability",
    "sequential schemes ( r - ss ) was applied successfully to parallel  series systems , when the total number of units to be tested in each subsystem was fixed .",
    "recently , in @xcite , a two stage design for the same purpose was presented and shown to be asymptotically optimal when the subsystems sample sizes are fixed and large at the same order of the total sample size of the system .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is useful to estimate the reliability of a parallel - series and/or by duality a series - parallel system , when the components reliabilities are unknown as well as the total numbers of units allowed to be tested in each subsystem .",
    "this work improves the results in @xcite by developing a hybrid two stage design to get a dynamic allocation between the sample sizes allowed for subsystems and those allowed for their components .",
    "for example , consider a parallel system of four components ( 1),(2),(3 ) and ( 4 ) , with reliabilities 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.95 and 0.99 , respectively , under the constraint that the total number of observations allowed is @xmath0 .",
    "then , the sequential scheme given in @xcite suggests to test , respectively , 10 , 10 , 28 and 52 units and produces a variance of the system reliability estimate equal @xmath1 , approximately . this is visibly better ,",
    "compared to the balanced scheme which takes an allocation equal 25 in each component and produces a variance ten times greater then the former .",
    "the hybrid sequential scheme proposed in this paper is a tool to solve the same problem when the components are replaced by subsystems .",
    "more precisely , it combines the schemes developed for parallel and/or series systems in order to obtain approximately the best allocation at subsystems level as well as at components level .    in section [ prelim ] , definitions and preliminary results",
    "are presented accompanied by the proper two stage design for a parallel subsystem just as was defined in @xcite and its asymptotic optimality is proved for a fixed and large sample size . in section",
    "[ lower ] , a parallel - series system is considered and it is shown that the variance of its reliability estimate has a lower bound independent of allocation .",
    "this leads , in section [ overlapping ] , to the main result of this paper which lies in the hybrid two stage algorithm and its asymptotic optimality for a fixed and large sample size allowed for the system . in section [ monte carlo ] ,",
    "the results are validated _ via _ monte carlo simulation and it is shown that our algorithm leads asymptotically to the best allocation scheme to reach the lower bound of the variance of the reliability estimate . the last section is reserved for conclusion and remarks .",
    "consider a system @xmath2 of @xmath3 subsystems @xmath4 connected in series , each subsystem @xmath5 contains @xmath6 components @xmath7 connected in parallel .",
    "the system should be referred as parallel - series system .",
    "assume s - independence within and across populations , then the system reliability is @xmath8 where @xmath9is the reliability of the parallel subsystem @xmath5 and @xmath10 the reliability of component @xmath11 .",
    "an estimator of @xmath12 is assumed to be the product of sample reliabilities@xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the sample mean of functioning units in component @xmath16,@xmath17@xmath15 is used to estimate @xmath10 where @xmath18 is the sample size and @xmath19 is the binary outcome of the unit @xmath20 in component @xmath21 .",
    "it should be pointed that a unit is not necessarily a physical object in a component , but it represents just a bernoulli observation of the functioning / failure state of that component .",
    "hence , for each subsystem @xmath5 , one must allocate@xmath22units such that the estimated reliability of the system is based on a total sample size@xmath23as in the series case , with the help of s - independence and the fact that a sample mean is an unbiased estimator of a bernoulli parameter , see @xcite , the variance of the estimated reliability @xmath24 incurred by any allocation scheme can be obtained , @xmath25where @xmath26   \\label{vp}\\]]is given as a function of the allocation numbers @xmath18 and the coefficients of variation of bernoulli populations@xmath27we have found convenient to work with the equivalent expression of ( [ vp ] ) , @xmath28,\\ ] ] where@xmath29is a sum over all the products of at least two of its arguments .    the problem is to estimate @xmath12 when components reliabilities are unknowns and a total number of @xmath30 units must be tested in the system at components level .",
    "the aim is to minimize the variance of @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the problem can be addressed by developing allocation schemes to select @xmath18 , the numbers of units to be tested in each component @xmath31 in the subsystem @xmath32 , under the constraint@xmath33such that the variance of @xmath24 is as small as possible .",
    "reliability sequential schemes ( r - ss ) exist for the series , parallel or parallel - series configurations when the sample sizes @xmath34 of the subsystems are fixed . therefore , one can fully optimize the variance of @xmath24 just by applying the ( r - ss ) to find the best partition @xmath35 of @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , a full sequential design can not be used in practice for large systems since the number of operations will growth dramatically . for this reason",
    ", we reasonably propose a hybrid two stage design which is shown to be asymptotically optimal when @xmath30 is large .",
    "for the asymptotic optimization of the variance of the estimated reliabilities , we make use of the well - known lagrange s identity which can be written in the form :    let @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the following identity holds.@xmath40\\ ] ]    [ th0]denote by @xmath41then@xmath42    the proof is a direct consequence of the previous identity ( [ lem1 ] ) .",
