    "in the rs2 model @xcite a significant role is played by the @xmath0 orbifold : the wavefunctions of gravitational perturbation that are antisymmetric across the brane are projected out . on the other hand",
    ", one could consider more general geometries in which the ads curvatures on either side of the brane are different .",
    "such branes can emerge as consistent solitonic solutions in 5d @xmath1 supergravities @xcite .",
    "these domain walls interpolate between the ads vacua with different cosmological constants , and are stable as they saturate the bps bound .",
    "given the special properties of the rs spectrum , and its relevance for holography , it appears interesting to study similar issues in the braneworld with the asymmetric bulk geometry .",
    "some of the properties of the asymmetric models were discussed previously , see , e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in particular , the present work was motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , which argued that the asymmetric model could provide uv completion to brane induced gravity @xcite . if true , such a model could be used to look at the strong coupling dynamics in @xcite , from a different perspective .",
    "below , we will give comprehensive studies of the spectrum and emphasize the similarities and differences of our results with the earlier ones .    at energies that exceed the ads curvature scales",
    "( but are still below the quantum gravity scale ) , both the rs2 and asymmetric model are expected to have similar behavior . on the other hand , at energies comparable to , or somewhat below of the ads curvature scales , the asymmetric model should behave differently from rs2 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath2 the two ads curvatures , assuming for definiteness @xmath3",
    ". at energies below @xmath4 one can `` integrate out '' a slice of @xmath5 space . in the holographic description this corresponds to integrating out modes in the energy / momentum interval @xmath6 .",
    "the result is the rs2 model with ads curvature @xmath4 on both sides , in which , however , the orbifold projection is not imposed ( i.e. , the antisymmetric perturbations are kept ) .",
    "moreover , in the low energy theory , while integrating out the slice of ads , the brane - induced einstein - hilbert ( eh ) term will appear . the coefficient in front of this term is going to be proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "hence , at energies below @xmath4 , the original asymmetric model reduces to the rs2 model without the orbifold projection and with the brane - induced eh term , similar to @xcite .",
    "the properties of this hybrid low - energy model are well understood @xcite . at energies above the scale @xmath8 gravity",
    "is similar to that of the dgp model @xcite .",
    "however , in the present construction this regime can not be reached , since the effective description in terms of the induced eh term is valid only at energies below @xmath4 , which is always smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the dgp phase , emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , does not seem to be attainable in the asymmetric braneworld scenario .",
    "nevertheless , as we will describe below , the asymmetric models exhibits a number of interesting properties .",
    "the rs zero - mode is still present , as long as both ads curvatures are nonzero .",
    "moreover , because of the absence of the orbifold projection , both symmetric and antisymmetric modes survive .",
    "conventionally , these modes can be grouped into two sets .",
    "one set has properties similar to the rs spectrum @xcite .",
    "the net result of the second set is a resonance state with the mass @xmath10 , and width @xmath11 .",
    "the strength of the resonance peak is proportional to the difference of the the two ads curvatures .",
    "it vanishes in the limit when the two curvatures are equal , and the corresponding set of states turns into the antisymmetric modes that are projected out from the rs model by the @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we set the action for the asymmetric model and discuss its general features . in section 3",
    "we derive the complete spectrum of linearized perturbations and discuss some of its properties and implications . in section 4",
    "we calculate the gravitational potential as seen by a braneworld observer in the asymmetric model and compare it with the potential of the rs2 model .",
    "the rs model has been extensively studied from the point of view of its holographic dual .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that the asymmetric model also has a holographic description .",

    "one could think of this geometry as being two half - ads spaces glued together across the brane at @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 curvatures on two sides of the brane .",
    "in general they are different and we define the ratio @xmath21 as a measure of the `` asymmetry '' of the model .",
    "there are questions concerning the stability of the setup .",
    "first , as we will show below , the small fluctuations in the model contain no tachyon or ghost modes .",
    "second , because of the asymmetry of the bulk cosmological constants , one may worry about the stability of the system with respect to the motion of the brane as a whole .",
    "however , when such a motion occurs , the gravitational background readjusts itself so that there is no net energy gain / loss on either side of the brane .",
    "hence , there is no reason for such an instability .",
    "this is of course consistent with the brane being a bosonic part of a supersymmetric bps object @xcite .",
    "the instability that could in general occur in the purely bosonic asymmetric case , is due to nonperturbative tunneling from one vacuum to the other via bubble nucleation process .",

    "when @xmath102 , i.e. , when one of the two sides is flat , we recover the results found in the previous subsection .",
    "it is a right place here to emphasize that the zero - mode strength is given by @xmath103 when @xmath104 it vanishes while the resonance reaches its maximal strength . on the other hand",
    ", the zero - mode has its maximal strength in the rs limit when the resonance decouples .",
    "we see that there is a complementarity between the resonance and zero - mode : when one disappears the other is present , and _",

    "this condition and remains unchanged .",
    "when the regulator brane is at a finite distance from the brane where matter is localized , these conditions will quantize the kk masses in units of @xmath120 . for simplicity",
    "we fix @xmath121 so that the discretized mass spectrum is equally distributed . in general",
    ", one could set both @xmath118 arbitrarily , but the result is a more complicated discretization of the mass spectrum of kk gravitons since boundary conditions on both regulator branes must be satisfied simultaneously .",

    "when @xmath122 the normalization constants of all the wave - functions are predominately those of plane waves , as in this limit the solutions we found approach free plane waves . in this case it is easy to calculate the mixing @xmath116 which is given by @xmath123 here @xmath124 are the sign factors for each wave - function as described before and @xmath125 are the two solutions of equations and .",

    "because of this , one of the two cft s in the low energy theory will not couple directly to the 4d matter .",
    "the effects of the high - scale coupling of this cft to the localized matter are encoded , in the low energy theory , in the induced eh term .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier observation that the resonance is above the cutoff @xmath173 .",
    "we have studied in detail the spectrum of gravitational perturbations in a brane - world scenario with asymmetric warped geometry .",
    "we have shown that even when the two ads curvatures @xmath181 are different , the rs zero - mode still exists . its strength on the brane is given by @xmath182^{1/2}$ ] , which vanishes if one side of the brane becomes space - time flat .",
    "a novelty is found in the massive kk graviton spectrum .",
    "when the warp factors are different , there exists a resonance mode in addition to the rs - like spectrum .",
    "the peak of this resonance is located at @xmath183 and it has a width of the order of the larger curvature scale . as the asymmetry between @xmath91 grows , the zero - mode becomes weaker and partially transmutes into the resonance mode . in the limit",
    "when the bulk space - time on one side of the brane is flat , the resonance mode reaches its maximal strength while the zero - mode is no longer normalizable and disappears from the spectrum . on the gravity side we studied numerically the 2-body gravitational potential measured on the brane - world , and discussed the holographic description of the asymmetric model .",
    "the obtained results can be useful for the particle physics model building via the ads / cft correspondence , as well as for the cosmology of early universe when studied in the context of warped space - times .",
    "we would like to thank ofer aharony , elias kiritsis and michele redi for useful discussions .",
