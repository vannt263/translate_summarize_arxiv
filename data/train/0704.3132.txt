    "although @xmath0 violation has been a central concern in particle physics since it was first observed in the neutral kaon system more than four decades ago @xcite the dynamical origin of @xmath0 violation still remains an open problem .",
    "@xmath0 violation in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) is supposed to arise from a weak complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix which is based on quark flavor mixing @xcite . therefore , the study of @xmath0 violation is essential to the test of the ckm mechanism in the sm .    besides the kaon system",
    "much more studies have been carried out on @xmath0 violation in the @xmath12 meson system both theoretically and experimentally in the past few years .",
    "it was suggested theoretically that large @xmath0 violating asymmetries should be observed in the experiments for @xmath12 mesons @xcite .",
    "this important prediction has already been confirmed by the experiments of babar and belle etc . through the measurements on @xmath0 violation in several decay channels of @xmath12 mesons such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite . from the summer of 2007 , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start to contribute to the exploration of @xmath0 violation in the @xmath12 meson system in a more accurate way due to its much higher statistics .",
    "this will also provide an opportunity to discover new physics beyond the sm .",
    "in the decay process we have the so - called direct @xmath0 violation which occurs through the interference of two amplitudes with different weak phases and strong phases .",
    "the weak phase difference is directly determined by the ckm matrix . on the contrary , the strong phase is usually due to complicated strong interaction and hence difficult to control .",
    "since a large strong phase difference is required for a large @xmath0 asymmetry , one needs to appeal to some phenomenological mechanism to get such a large strong phase difference .",
    "the charge asymmetry violating mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath5 ( @xmath3 mixing ) has been applied for this purpose in the past few years . from a series of studies for @xmath0 violation in some decay channels of heavy hadrons including @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it has been found that @xmath3 mixing can provide a very large strong phase difference ( usually 90 degrees ) when the mass of the decay product of @xmath18(@xmath5 ) , @xmath19 , is in the vicinity of the @xmath5 resonance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the measurement of the @xmath0 violating asymmetry for these decays can be used to remove the mod @xmath10 ambiguity in the determination of the @xmath0 violating phase angle @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the @xmath0 violating asymmetry for the decay @xmath1 .",
    "this process is unique since it has two @xmath6 mesons in the intermediate state , each of them contributing @xmath3 mixing .",
    "one can expect that there should be a bigger @xmath0 violating asymmetry than in the case where @xmath3 mixing only contributes once .",
    "it will be shown from our explicit calculations that this is true indeed .",
    "the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in the case of double @xmath3 mixing could be 30 ",
    "50% bigger than that in the case of single @xmath3 mixing , depending on the value of @xmath7 and @xmath20 ( see the meaning of @xmath7 and @xmath20 below ) .    in our calculations of the @xmath0 violating asymmetry ,",
    "hadronic matrix elements for both tree and penguin operators in the effective hamiltonian are involved .",
    "these matrix elements are controlled by the effects of nonperturbative qcd which are difficult to handle . in order to extract the strong phase difference we will use the factorization approximation ,",
    "in which one of the currents in the hamiltonian is factorized out and generates a meson , assuming the vacuum intermediate state saturation . in this way",
    ", the decay amplitude becomes the product of two matrix elements .",
    "such factorization scheme was first argued to be plausible in energetic decays like bottom - hadron decays @xcite@xcite , then was proved to be the leading order result in the framework of qcd factorization when the radiative qcd corrections of order @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the b - quark mass ) and the @xmath23 corrections in the heavy quark effective theory are neglected @xcite .",
    "since the nonfactorizable contributions are ignored in the factorization scheme we introduce an effective parameter , @xmath7 , in order to take into account nonfactorizable contributions effectively . in this way , the value of @xmath7 is not the color number ( 3 ) any more , but should be determined by experimental data . in the present work , this will be done by comparing the theoretical results with the experimental data for the decay branching ratios for the processes @xmath8 and @xmath24 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamckm ] we briefly present the effective hamiltonian , the wilson coefficients and the ckm matrix elments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cpv1 ] we give the formalism for the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in @xmath25 via @xmath3 mixing .",
    "then we give the calculation details of the strong phase difference and the numerical results for the @xmath0 violating asymmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : branchratio ] , we calculate the branching ratios for @xmath26 and @xmath24 and present the range of @xmath7 allowed by the latest experimental data for these decays . in the last section ,",
    "we give a summary and discussion .",
    "in order to calculate the direct @xmath0 violating asymmetry one needs to use the following effective weak hamiltonian based on the operator product expansion @xcite : @xmath27{2}}[\\sum_{q = d , s}v_{ub } v_{uq}^ * ( c_1 o_1^u + c_2 o_2^u)-v_{tb } v_{tq}^*\\sum_{i=3}^{10}c_i o_i]+h .",
    "c. , \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28(i=1, ... ,10 ) are the wilson coefficients , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the ckm matrix elements .",
    "the operators @xmath33 have the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath11 and @xmath35 are color indices , and @xmath36 or @xmath37 quarks . in eq .",
    "( [ oper ] ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 are tree operators , @xmath40@xmath41 are qcd penguin operators , and @xmath42@xmath43 arise from electroweak penguin diagrams .",
    "the wilson coefficients are known to the next - to - leading logarithmic order @xcite .",
    "they are renormalization scheme dependent since the renormalization prescription involves an arbitrariness in the finite parts in the renormalization procedure .",
    "the physical quantities should be renormalization scheme independent .",
    "since the radiative qcd corrections are not included in the factorization approach we work , the hadronic matrix elements do not carry any information about the renormalization scheme dependence .",
    "therefore , we choose to use the renormalization scheme independent wilson coefficients which are defined in refs .",
    "@xcite so that the @xmath0 violating asymmetry we obtain is renormalization scheme independent .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath44 is chosen as the energy scale in the decays of the @xmath12 meson , @xmath45 . when @xmath46 gev , these renormalization scheme independent wilson coefficients take the following values @xcite",
    ": @xmath47    the matrix elements of the operators @xmath33 should be renormalized to the one - loop order .",
    "this results in the effective wilson coefficients , @xmath48 , which satisfy the constraint @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the matrix elements at the tree level , which will be evaluated in the factorization approach . from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , the relations between @xmath48 and @xmath28 are @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ p_e=(\\alpha_{em}/9\\pi)(3c_1+c_2)[10/9+g(m_c,\\mu , q^2)],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath55-quark mass and @xmath56 is the typical momentum transfer of the gluon or photon in the penguin diagrams .",
    "@xmath57 has the following explicit expression @xcite : @xmath58    the value of @xmath56 is chosen to be in the range @xmath59 @xcite . from eqs .",
    "( [ cvalue ] ) ( [ cc ] ) ( [ g ] ) we can obtain numerical values of @xmath48 which are listed in table [ wilson coefficients ] , where we have taken @xmath60=0.118 , @xmath61=1/132.2 , @xmath22=5 gev , and @xmath54=1.35 gev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in the process @xmath1 including the effect of @xmath3 mixing .",
    "the advantage of @xmath3 mixing is that it makes the strong phase difference , @xmath62 , between the hadronic matrix elements of the tree and penguin operators very large at the @xmath5 resonance for a fixed @xmath7 .",
    "we have found that sin@xmath62 becomes large and reaches the maximum point at the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry reaches the maximum value when the invariant masses of the @xmath4 pairs in the decay product are in the vicinity of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "furthermore , since there are two @xmath6 mesons in the intermediate state , @xmath3 mixing contributes twice when we work to the first order of isospin violation .",
    "this leads to an even larger @xmath0 violating asymmetry than in the case where only single @xmath3 mixing is involved .",
    "this is unique for the process @xmath1 . as a result",
    ", the largest @xmath0 violating asymmetry could be more than 90% for some values of @xmath7 .",
    "this could be observed in the future experiments at lhc .",
    "now , we roughly estimate the possibility to observe this @xmath0 violating asymmetry .",
    "if the branching ratio for @xmath26 is of order @xmath63 , then the number of @xmath64 pairs needed for observing the @xmath0 violating asymmetry ( 90% ) is roughly @xmath65 for @xmath66 signature and @xmath67 for @xmath68 signature @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that at lhc , the number of @xmath64 pairs could be around @xmath69 ( for atlas and cms ) and @xmath70 ( for lhcb ) per year @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to observe the @xmath0 violation for @xmath1 via the double @xmath3 mixing mechanism at lhc .    in the calculation , we need the wilson coefficients for the tree and penguin operators at the scale @xmath22 .",
    "we work with the renormalization scheme independent wilson coefficients .",
    "we have found that apart from the @xmath3 mixing mechanism , the wilson coefficients themselves could also give observable @xmath0 violating asymmetry in some cases .",
    "the errors in the ckm matrix elements lead to some uncertainties in the @xmath0 violating asymmetry .",
    "even bigger uncertainties come from the hadronic matrix elements of the tree and penguin operators due to the nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "we have worked in the factorization approach , with the effective parameter @xmath7 being introduced to account for the nonfactorizable effects .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in this decay process strongly depends on the parameter @xmath7 .    in order to determine the range of @xmath7",
    "we have compared the theoretical values and the experimental data for the branching ratios for @xmath8 and @xmath24 .",
    "we have found that the latest experimental data constrain @xmath7 to be in the range @xmath71 for @xmath20=0.3 and @xmath72 for @xmath20=0.5 , respectively , when we let the ckm matrix elements vary in the ranges determined by the current experiments .",
    "we have studied the sign of @xmath73 in the range of @xmath7 and found that @xmath73 changes its sign at the point @xmath74 .",
    "this also leads to the change of the sign of the @xmath0 violating asymmetry . due to the large errors in the current experimental data for the branching ratios for @xmath75 and @xmath9 we can not constrain @xmath7 more accurately at present .",
    "if the future experimental data could constrain @xmath7 to be less than 3.68 ( @xmath7 is usually less than 3.68 in other studies ) , the sign of the @xmath0 violating asymmetry would remain unchanged in the whole range of @xmath7 .",
    "then one could remove the mod @xmath10 ambiguity in the determination of the @xmath0 violating phase angle @xmath11 by measuring the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in @xmath1 .    for the decay process @xmath76 , the factorization approach we have used",
    "is expected to be a good approximation since @xmath12 meson decays are energetic and since @xmath77 and @xmath78 corrections should be small in the qcd factorization scheme .",
    "one may also work in the qcd factorization scheme , taking the value of @xmath7 to be 3 and including corrections of order @xmath77 as done in ref .",
    "however , the qcd factorization scheme suffers from endpoint singularities which are not well controlled .",
    "the @xmath0 violating asymmetry depends on the unknown parameters which are associated with such endpoint singularities .",
    "this lead to very uncertain @xmath0 violating asymmetries in the qcd factorization scheme @xcite . as mentioned before , the uncertainty for the @xmath0 violating asymmetry is also very large in the factorization approach we have used , i.e. from about -96% to about 56% depending on the value of @xmath7 and the ckm matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry may strongly depend on the factorization approach adopted @xcite .",
    "all these issues need further and more careful investigations .",
