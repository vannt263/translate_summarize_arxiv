    "satellites of the giant planets in the solar system are typically categorized into regular and irregular moons .",
    "regular moons orbit their host planet in circular , low inclination short period orbits ; irregular moons have highly inclined ( and even retrograde ) , typically eccentric and have longer period orbits .",
    "similar to planet formation , the formation of satellite systems around giant planets in the solar system ( and in exoplanetary systems ) is difficult to study theoretically .",
    "regular satellites are thought to have formed through collisional growth of smaller planetesimals in the circum - planetary disk , very similar to planet formation in the coagulation model for the terrestrial planets .",
    "irregular satellites are typically thought to have formed elsewhere in the solar system ( as asteroid / kuiper - belt object like planetesimals ) , and only later be captured to become moons .",
    "the various models suggested have major difficuties in explaining the origin of the irregular moons ( ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) ) .",
    "more succesful recent capture models have been suggested ; these involve planet - planet interactions , and the existence of an additional third ice - giant planet in the solar system that have been later ejected from it @xcite .",
    "an oversimplified but useful approach used to study satellite formation is to divide it into two stages , based on the importance of the effects of gas and the circum - planetary disk on the growing satellites .",
    "the first stage lasts a few myr , until the dissipation of the gaseous circum - planetary disk , following the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk which fuels it . at the end of this stage large moons",
    "should have formed @xcite in addition to and ( possibly many ) smaller moonlets .",
    "the second stage begins following the gas dissipation . at this stage",
    "the evolution is driven primarily by gravitational interactions and collisions between the moons . in comparison with the extensive study of the first stage of satellite - system formation in a gaseous disk , the dynamical relaxation through moon - moon scattering at the later stage",
    "have scarcely been explored . here",
    "we study this dynamical evolution using analytic techniques and n - body simulations of moon - moon scattering around giant planets , and suggest that it can play a major role in the build - up and sculpting of the architecture of satellite systems , both in the solar system as well as in ( not yet detected ) exomoon systems .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first provide a brief overview of the various processes seen in our n - body moon - moon scattering simulations , which are later discussed in more detail .",
    "we introduce the n - body simulations used to study the satellite systems , and discuss the initial conditions following the dissipation of the gaseous circum - planetary disk , followed by a brief discussion of the stability of multi - moon systems .",
    "we then provide an analytic context to dynamical relaxation of multi - moon systems .",
    "we describe several examples of multi - moon systems studied through n - body simulations and present their evolution and outcomes , demonstrating the possible outcomes .",
    "finally we discuss the evolution of multi - moon system through scattering and their implications for satellites systems as well as the populations of minor bodies in the solar system ( asteroids , trans - neptunian objects , comets etc ) .",
    "dynamical evolution of a satellite system goes through various stages .",
    "we will first review these stages , and then discuss them in more detail both analytically and through examples from n - body simulations .    *",
    "instability * : following the formation of the moons in an extended circum - planetary disk , they mutually perturb each other gravitationally . as long as a gaseous disk or a planetesimal disk exist , such disks might dissipate the perturbation and stabilize the system . after the disk is gone",
    ", the mutual perturbations may destabilize the systems on short timescales , if their masses are large and/or the separations between them are small enough ( similar to the well studied planet - planet scattering case;e.g .",
    "the perturbations can then grow and lead to orbit crossing between the various moons . here",
    "we study only the evolution of satellite system at the onset of dynamical instability after the gaseous disk has been gone .    * scattering , collsional growth and production of prograde irregular satellites : * in an unstable system the moons will scatter each other gravitationally , leading to orbital changes , exciting the eccentricity and inclinations of the satellites .",
    "when the relative velocities between the moons become larger than the escape velocity from their surface , physical collisions between moons will occur , which might alleviate further growth of the moons and/or their possible disruption .",
    "moons excited to high eccentricities may collide with the host planet .",
    "alternatively , a moon can be scattered to a large distance extending beyond the stable region around the planet ( typically @xmath0 or even @xmath1 for prograde and retrograde orbits , respectively ) , and then be ejected from the system to become a runaway moon . through the scattering process moons can migrate in the disk and exchange positions to produce a mixed order , i.e. erasing the signature of the original moon ordering .",
    "* secular evolution and the kozai - lidov `` barrier '' * : moons excited to high inclinations with respect to the orbital plane of the host planet around the sun , can become susceptible to large amplitude secular orbital evolution due to the tidal perturbations by the sun or by other moons ( so called kozai - lidov oscillations ) .",
    "such secular evolution can drive the satellite orbits into extremely eccentric orbits , and eventually lead to their collision with another moon or the planet , or to their ejection from the system .",
    "it is therefore difficult for moon scattering processes to directly lead to excitation of retrograde orbits from initially prograde orbits .",
    "a similar limitation on eccentricities could also be seen in planet - planet scattering simulations of exo - planetary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "scattering to stable high inclination orbits is therefore limited by a kozai - lidov `` barrier '' .",
    "* temporary and permanent re - capture of runaway moons and the origin of retrograde irregular moons * : following their ejection , runaway moons , now on helio - centric orbits , are likely to interact again with the host planet .",
    "some can interact with the other solar system planets and/or protoplanetary disk and may obtain a stable helio - centric orbit .",
    "others might strongly interact with the planet and even be ejected from the solar system .",
    "runaway moons can also be re - captured temporarily into orbits around the planet even into retrograde orbits with respect to the orbit of the planet around the sun . such re - captured moons can potentially dissipate some of their kinetic energy through scattering and/or collisions with other moons orbiting the planet and/or tidal interaction with the planet ( i.e. somewhat similar to planet capture from wide eccentric orbits into close retrograde orbits in planet scattering simulations ; @xcite ) , and thereby be re - captured into permanent orbits .",
    "we conjecture that such dissipative processes could produce retrograde irregular moons ( similar to the models envisioning capture of objects formed independently in the protoplanetary disk ) . here",
    "we only model purely dynamical interactions and do not include dissipative processes ( beside direct collisions ) , which will be explored elsewhere .",
    "throughout this paper we discuss the results of several n - body simulations ( using the mercury code @xcite ) of satellite systems . in following papers",
    "we will describe the statistical results of a large sample of simulations through the study of a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "the current paper focuses on presenting the basic processes and outcomes of moon - moon scattering process , and only presents results from a small number of simulations to provide explicit examples .",
    "the results of these specific simulations are corroborated by the much larger set of simulations ( see payne & perets ; paper i ) , for detailed discussion of the extended n - body simulations ) .",
    "table 1 provides the the initial conditions for these simulations .",
    "we have used a single neptune like planet ( neptune mass and separation from the sun ) , orbited by a large number of moons ( 10 - 50 massive moons , and in some cases up to 1000 massless particles corresponding to low mass moons ) . in all simulation",
    "the outermost moon is placed at a distance @xmath2 ( i.e. at stable orbits comparable to the outermost prograde satellites in the solar system ; @xmath3 is the planet hill radius ) and subsequent moons are placed internal to this moon at separations of @xmath4 mutual hill radii from each other . in all simulations shown here the moons",
    "are put on co - planar orbits coinciding with the orbital plane of the planet orbit around the sun ; with only small random inclinations , distributed randomly between @xmath5 and 0 - 0.01 eccentricities .",
    "though we show results of moon - moon scattering around a neptune like planet , results of similar satellite systems around other solar system like planets show similar results ( perets et al .",

    "direct n - body simulations show that initially stable systems require a few mutual hill radii separation between the planets in order not to destabilize on a short timescale @xcite ; however no general stability criteria is known for @xmath15 objects orbiting a central massive object . in all the simulations of moon scattering we initialized all moons to reside at 4 - 6 mutual hill radii from their closest neighbor .",
    "let us first consider a single encounter between two moons , occurring at some distance @xmath16 from the planet , assuming a fast encounter at the impulse approximation limit .",
    "the kick velocity to a given moon ( assumed to be smaller , for simplicity ) through scattering by a moon of mass @xmath17 ( and radius @xmath18 ) is of the order of    @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the impact parameter , and @xmath21 is the relative velocity between the moons , typically comparable to the velocity dispersion in the circum - planetary satellite disk . for a heated disk ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is of the order of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the height ratio of the disk , and @xmath24 is the keplerian velocity at distance @xmath16 from the planet ( cite ) , i.e. @xmath25 . comparing the kick velocity gained through a close approach ( comparable to a few times the satellite radius , @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 , for which we can assume tidal effect are negligible ) to the keplerian velocity ( for a circular orbit ) around the planet at that position , @xmath28 we get the radius at which a mutual kick could significantly change the satellite orbit ( where we assume a constant disk height ratio , @xmath29 )    @xmath30    replacing the keplerian velocity with the escape velocity , we can similarly get the critical radius from which moons can be ejected from the system ( though in practice , due to the tidal perturbation by the sun moons ejected beyond @xmath31 would already become unbound from the system ) .    for scattering by the most massive observed moons for each of the giant planets , we find that @xmath32 @xmath8 , taking the satellites ganymede , titan , titania and triton ( for jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune , respectively ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that even single strong encounters with such moons can significantly alter the orbits of companion moons and even eject them , if found beyond @xmath33 , which , for reasonable @xmath34 ratios includes most of the stable region around these planets .    as mentioned above , no analytic criteria for instability of multi - planets",
    "is currently known , but simulations of multi - planet systems show that such systems evolve into strong scatterings and orbit crossing when the mutual distance between planets are a few mutual hill radii or less . in our simulations",
    "we typically separate each neighboring moon by 4 mutual hill radii , but we find that even larger separations ( 5 - 6 mutual hill radii ) eventually lead to strong scatterings ( see also paper i ) .      the dynamical evolution of a disk of planetesimals has been extensively studied both numerically and analytically . making use of similar tools we would expect viscous stirring to excite the eccentricities and inclinations of the moons in circum - planetary disk . for a disk composed of @xmath35 equal mass moons , with mass @xmath36 , the evolution of the velocity dispersion in the disk , @xmath37 , with time would then go like ( following @xcite ; see also @xcite )    @xmath38    for a disk ( or ring ) centered at radius @xmath39 , with a radial width @xmath40 ; @xmath41 is the coulomb logarithm ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the keplerian orbital period at @xmath39 ; @xmath44 is a constant pre - factor ( @xcite find @xmath45 in their disk simulations ) .",
    "effectively , as the disk evolves moons may be ejected or collide and therefore @xmath35 and/or @xmath36 should evolve with time . nevertheless , this should serve as a good approximation at the earlier stages of the evolution , before a significant number of ejections / collisions of moons occur .",
    "the change in disk thickness would also affect the maximal effective distance between encounters , thereby affecting @xmath46 ; but the latter effect is logarithmically weak .",

    "it is well established that irregular satellites can be strongly affected by secular kozai - lidov ( kl ) evolution due to perturbations by the sun ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "the amplitude of such oscillations can become large when the inclinations with respect to the orbit of the host planet around the sun are larger than @xmath62(somewhat smaller for non - zero eccentricity orbits ) .",
    "in particular , excitation of large eccentricities can lead to mutual orbit crossing of the various moons and eventually to strong scattering between them .",

    "moons scattered into high ( mutual ) inclination ( with respect to the planet orbit around the sun ) are not likely to survive long before they collide with the planet / other moon or are ejected from the system .",
    "such evolution depletes moons at high inclinations ; the lifetime of moons at such inclinations is short ; they can not achieve high inclinations close to @xmath63 , which would allow them , through additional scattering ( or secular evolution ) obtain retrograde orbits .",
    "rather , they are either scattered into at most @xmath64 and are then scattered back to lower inclinations or they are destroyed ( collision or ejection ) .",
    "we note , however , that kl evolution is very sensitive to other perturbations affecting the pericenter precession of the orbits , and can be easily quenched due to competing interactions ( e.g. the combined perturbations of the other moons alter the pure kl evolution due to the sun ; tidal interaction and/or the oblateness of the planet can also alter such evolution , at least for moons achieving small pericenters ; see also @xcite for a similar discussion in the context of planet - planet scattering ) .",
    "though long term stability of high inclination orbit is difficult , we nevertheless find many moons do chive retrograde orbits throughout their orbital evolution , sometimes even for long period of time ( thousands of years ) .",
    "moon - moon scattering can therefore produce not only prograde irregular satellites , but also retrograde irregular ones .",
    "analysis of their dynamical history reveals that all moons showing this behavior have been , at earlier times , ejected from the system , and have later been temporarily recaptured into retrograde orbits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital_evolution ] show a typical example of such evolution ) .",
    "such a temporary capture , if followed by a dissipative process , could produce irregular moons ; indeed this is the basic mechanism suggested to produce irregular moons in the moon - capture scenario .",
    "our results therefore suggest that in - situ formation of moons followed by scattering can lead to similar outcomes as the capture scenarios , without alluding to capture of externally formed planetesimals , i.e. irregular moons might be recaptured moons , in addition to , or instead of being captured asteroids / kbos .    in our simulations",
    "we do not account for any dissipation from e.g. interaction with gas or tidal friction during close encounters with the host planet .",
    "scattering by other moons can also stabilize the orbit of such recaptured runaway moons to become permanently captured .",
    "nevertheless , we find no satellites that survived in retrograde orbits more that few thousands years .",
    "in fact , we find that all the moons which eventually collided with the host planet in our simulations did so only after they have been ejected and had been temporarily recaptured . in fig .",
    "[ fig : captured_incs ] we show the inclination distribution of such satellites prior to their collision .",
    "this suggests that introducing tidal interaction with the planet can have a major part in potentially stabilizing the orbits of these moons , and potentially produce the retrograde satellites we see today .",
    "indeed , it had been shown that the tidal effects are essential for producing retrograde planets in planet - scattering simulations ( e.g. payne et al . ,",

    "the addition of tidal interactions could potentially dissipate sufficient energy as to recapture such moons , and quench any further excitation of the eccentricity which would have otherwise lead to their collision with the planet . ]",
    "the discovery of hundreds of exo - planetary systems in the last two decades have provided new perspectives on the possible architecture of planetary systems .",
    "in contrast to the solar system with its co - planar configuration of planets in nearly circular orbits , many exo - planetary systems present planets on highly inclined ( with respect to the spin of their host star ) and/or on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "planets are thought to form in a protoplanetary disk which could naturally account for the existence of planets on co - planar circular orbits .",
    "the new discoveries of eccentric / inclined planetary orbits gave rise to models in which following the formation of multiple planets , they mutually perturbed and scatter each other through gravitational interactions .",
    "such dynamical excitation eventually leads to the ejection of most of the planets , and the survival of typically 1 - 3 planets on eccentric and inclined orbits , with orbital properties consistent with observations .",
    "regular moons of the solar system gas giants have been suggested to form in a circum - planetary disk around their host planet , in an analogue process to the formation of the solar system planets and exoplanets observed in co - planar , circular orbits .",
    "as demonstrated here , massive moons ( comparable in mass to the regular moons ) which formed on co - planar circular orbits beyond the region of the regular moons can scatter each other and/or scatter a population of low mass satellites ( massless particles in our simulations ) into eccentric and inclined configurations thereby producing irregular - like moons , serving as the satellite analogue for eccentric / inclined exo - planetary systems .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows    1 .",
    "most of the massive moons are ejected , typically leaving behind 1 - 4 surviving moons on stable configurations , irrespective of the initial number of moons , very similar to the results of planet - planet scattering experiments in multi - planet scattering studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the moons are either ejected , collide with one each other ( potentially leading to further satellite growth ) or collide with the planet .",
    "2 .   the surviving massive moons can obtain high eccentricities and inclinations , similar to those of prograde irregular moons observed in the solar system .",
    "however , none of the massive moons obtain a stable retrograde orbit .",
    "a non - negligible fraction of the small moons ( massless particles ) in our simulations ( @xmath66% ) are ejected from the system but are then temporarily recaptured , for times between a few years to a few thousand of years . of these recaptured moons",
    "@xmath67 % have retrograde inclinations just before they collide with the planet .",
    "we therefore conclude that multiple moon systems can behave very similarly to multiple planet systems , and can produce satellite systems with high eccentricity and high inclination _ prograde _ irregular satellites .",
    "we conjecture that moons observed to temporarily attain retrograde orbits during their evolution can potentially be stabilized through dissipative processes ( such as strong interaction with a disk / other moons or the planet ) and may also produce stable _ retrograde _ irregular moons , somewhat similar to the observed behavior of planet - scattering simulations which consider tidal interactions ( e.g. payne et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "note that currently no massive irregular moons beside triton are observed in the solar system ; though this may serve as an important constraint on the moon - moon scattering scenario ever happening in the solar system , it is possible that massive irregular moons were later removed through dissipative processes not studied here ( e.g. migration in the circum - planetary disk into close separations to the host planet , tidal interaction with the planet , or strong disrupting collisions ) . the introduction of dissipative processes in moon - moon scattering simulations will be studied in detail elsewhere .",
    "finally , we note that moon - moon scattering mechanism can produce large planetesimals in heliocentric orbits that were originally formed as moons , and were later ejected from their host planet .",
    "such planetesimals might still be observed today as asteroids / kuiper belt objects , and may have unique kinematic and/or peculiar properties in term of composition and/or structure compared to the background heliocentric formed planetesimal population , due to their different origin ."

    "<S> regular moons revolve around their host planet in circular , low inclination short period orbits , and are thought to form in - situ through coagulation processes . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , irregular moons have highly inclined ( and even retrograde ) , typically eccentric and long period orbits around their host planet . </S>",
    "<S> irregular moons are therefore often thought to have formed as unbound objects in helio - centric orbits that were later captured to their current orbits around the planet </S>",
    "<S> . however , such capture scenarios require fine tuned conditions and/or encounter difficulties in producing irregular moon populations around all gas giants . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the possibility that regular moons form in - situ outside the currently observed regular - moon regime , and dynamically evolve through mutual moon - moon scattering ( as well as by secular evolution due to perturbations by the sun ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such evolution can excite the satellites into high eccentricities and inclinations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that moons are either ejected from the host planet to become runaway moons , or stay bound and become prograde orbiting irregular moons with inclined and eccentric orbits around their host planet . </S>",
    "<S> ejected moons , unbound to the planet , can later be temporarily re - captured by the host planet even at retrograde orbits . </S>",
    "<S> such moons are eventually re - ejected from the system or collide with the planet , at least in the absence of dissipative processes ( e.g. collisions with existing bound moons , a debris disk or through tidal interactions with the host planet ) , not currently modeled . </S>",
    "<S> uncaptured runaway moons may eventually be ejected from the solar system , or be captured into stable helio - centric orbits and contribute to the populations of asteroidal or trans - neptunian objects . </S>",
    "<S> such scenarios are relevant both for the gas - giant satellites in the solar system and for the dynamical evolution of exomoons . </S>"
