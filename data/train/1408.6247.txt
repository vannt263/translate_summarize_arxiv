    "this project results from the convergence of four topics : systems of polynomial equations , flexibility of two and three dimensional objects , computational chemistry , and computer algebra .",
    "it also has application to robotics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we have developed software to detect flexibility in certain structures that are generically rigid .",
    "it is based on symbolic computation of polynomials and rational functions , not numerical computing .",
    "we previously reported on earlier stages of this research in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since then , the software has been enormously improved in both power and efficiency , to the point where it not only discovers the previously known modes of flexibility of a classic structure due to r. bricard , but discovers new modes apparently unknown to him .",
    "we are mostly concerned with the framework in figure 1 .",
    "it is a system of seven bars , joined at the nine junctions shown by rotational joints , allowing free rotation in the plane .",
    "it is _ generically rigid .",
    "_ this follows from a general theorem in kinematics @xcite by which the mobility ( number of degrees of freedom of relative motion ) of a linkage system is given by the relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of members , @xmath2 is the number of joints and @xmath3 is the mobility at joint @xmath4 . for the system in figure 1 , comprised entirely of rigid rods with rotatable joints ( with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) this gives @xmath8 .    when @xmath9 the system is generically flexible .",
    "when @xmath10 it is generically rigid or _ determined_. we wish to discover cases , by means of particular relations existing between its edges , that determinacy ( rigidity ) ceases to hold . then the framework will be deformable ( flexible ) .",
    "flexibility is an intuitive concept .",
    "imagine a triangle made of three stiff rods joined with movable hinges .",
    "the formula above confirms the clear intuition that the structure is obviously rigid . in the same way ,",
    "a quadrilateral in the plane is obviously flexible , and for it @xmath9 .",
    "( @xmath11 = 1 ) .    in computational chemistry",
    ", protein folding has been a major research topic for a number of years @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "molecules can fold because they are flexible .",
    "simple examples are easily built from a few plastic balls and rods . in 1812 ,",
    "cauchy considered flexibility of three dimensional polyhedra with triangular facets ( similar to a geodesic dome ) where each joint can pivot or hinge .",
    "he proved that if the polyhedron is convex it can not be flexible ; it must be rigid @xcite . in 1896",
    "bricard @xcite tried to find non - convex flexible polyhedra by looking at one of the smallest possible cases , octahedra .",
    "he partially succeeded : his flexible octahedra are not imbedible in actual three - space because some of their facets intercross .",
    "he also described the system of three quadrilaterals in the plane ( figure 1 ) whose motion is algebraically equivalent to the octahedra .",
    "people came to believe that there were no flexible polyhedra at all . but in 1978 robert connelly , building on bricard , astonished them by finding a non - convex one @xcite , and soon models appeared of a simpler flexible structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our approach is to describe the geometry of the object or molecule with a set of multivariate polynomial equations .",
    "solving a system of multivariate polynomial equations is a classic , difficult problem .",
    "the approach via resultants was pioneered by bezout @xcite , dixon @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , sylvester @xcite , and others .",
    "the resultant appears as a factor of the determinant of a matrix containing multivariate polynomials .",
    "computing it can be quite a challenge @xcite , but we developed methods to do so @xcite . once we have the resultant , we described @xcite an algorithm we call _ solve _ that examines the resultant and determines ways that the structure can be flexible .",
    "we discovered in this way some of the conditions of flexibility for bricard s arrangement of quadrilaterals in @xcite that is algebraically equivalent to the octahedra .",
    "_ solve _ was greatly improved by fox @xcite and more recently again by us .",
    "it is at least 500 times faster on bricard s quadrilaterals than in 2008 , and now finds all three of bricard s ways the quadrilaterals can flex ( this was not true in @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , _ solve _ has discovered new flexible arrangements of the quadrilaterals that were apparently not anticipated by bricard .",
    "the main point of this paper is that our new algebraic and algorithmic solution of bricard s quadrilaterals demonstrates that the software has matured to the point where one can confidently use it on more complex structures , such as molecules .",
    "all computations here were done with lewis s computer algebra system _ fermat _",
    "@xcite , which excels as polynomial and matrix computations @xcite .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we are primarily concerned here with the analysis of the flexibility of a certain structure of bricard consisting of seven rigid rods forming three quadrilaterals in the plane ( figure 1 ) . we need to establish that our software can find all the flexible cases .",
    "it order to show why we are confident in this , we will present proofs paralleling some of those of bricard @xcite , but ours are quite different and more algebraic .",
    "other than historical motivation , why should we concentrate on this arrangement of rods ? as remarked in the introduction , a quadrilateral in the plane @xmath12 is obviously flexible ( @xmath13 ; see figure 1 ) .",
    "imagine that @xmath14 is fixed .",
    "as @xmath15 pivots about @xmath16 , the angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 take on a continuum of values .",
    "if we add @xmath19 and @xmath20 we have two nested quadrilaterals , and the structure remains obviously flexible ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath21 also takes on a continuum of values , unless we set @xmath22 , so @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; then @xmath21 would be constantly @xmath25 during the flex .",
    "that is a _ degenerate _ case .",
    "the addition of one more rod or ",
    "brace \" @xmath26 produces a third quadrilateral @xmath27 .",
    "the structure is now generically rigid ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , it can be made flexible in several ways .",
    "a degenerate way to do so is to simply place @xmath26 on top of @xmath29 , so @xmath30 .",
    "we are not concerned with such degeneracies here .",
    "far more interesting is to choose the lengths of the rods ( sides ) so that each quadrilateral is a parallelogram .",
    "obviously , the system is then flexible .",
    "this is one of the cases we analyze below ( section four ) .",
    "this is our goal : _ non - generic flexibility . _",
    "the system of figure 1 is one of the simplest to examine for non - degenerate flexibility , and was thought by bricard to be  equivalent \" to two octahedra in three dimensions .",
    "our strategy is to describe the arrangement by a system of three polynomial equations , where the parameters are the lengths of the sides , and the three variables represent the tangents of certain angles in the structure . using resultants , we show that flexibility implies that each of the three tangents is a rational function of the other two , and analyze when one tangent can be a rational function of only one other .",
    "we thereby derive the three flexible cases that were defined by bricard , but with new subcases .    as in bricard",
    "s paper on flexible octahedra , elementary geometry and trigonometry lead to a system of three polynomial equations in three variables @xmath31 and fifteen parameters ( details in next paragraph ) , namely @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    the fifteen parameters are themselves simple polynomial functions of the sides of the flexing quadrilaterals , in such a way that @xmath35 .",
    "the other parameters might be 0 .",
    "the @xmath36 are half - angle tangents of angles @xmath37 in the quadrilaterals ; see figure 1 .",
    "( cotangents could also be used , which has the effect of replacing @xmath36 with @xmath38 .",
    "this will be used in theorem 3 . )",
    "the seven rigid rods are @xmath39 .",
    "the joints allow each rod to pivot freely in the plane .",
    "@xmath14 remains fixed on the @xmath40axis during pivoting , with @xmath16 at the origin .",
    "we allow negative values for @xmath41 , or @xmath42 , so points @xmath43 might be below the @xmath44-axis .",
    "angles @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be discussed later in theorem 4 .",
    "the equations arise from figure 1 using basic geometry and trigonometry .",
    "for example , the coordinates of the point @xmath47 are @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is @xmath51 .",
    "therefore @xmath52 one obtains three equations of this kind ( using also @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and three obvious equations of type @xmath55 . then use the well - known half angle tangent substitutions @xmath56 and so on ( with @xmath57 ) to form the three equations @xmath58",
    "the fifteen parameters become    @xmath59 none of the sides @xmath60 is 0 . @xmath61 . for convenience ,",
    "we also define @xmath62 , and we also refer to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 as  sides \" .",
    "as we discussed above , the arrangement of quadrilaterals in figure 1 is generically rigid .",
    "that means , in spite of the flexible joints , if numerical values were assigned arbitrarily for the eleven sides , the angles @xmath37 would be uniquely determined .",
    "the main task of this paper is       * problem : find conditions on the sides under which the quadrilateral arrangement becomes flexible . *",
    "+   +    flexibility is marked mathematically by the three angles , and their half - angle tangents @xmath36 , each taking on uncountably many values .",
    "as remarked above , if all three quadrilaterals are parallelograms , the arrangement is flexible .",
    "this means that under the substitutions @xmath66 , not only are there common roots to the system of equations @xmath58 , but there is a continuum of common roots ; each @xmath36 is a never - constant continuous function @xmath67 .",
    "_ never - constant _ means there is no open interval over which @xmath36 is constant . allowing that would create degenerate cases , which we do not discuss here .",
    "( some are discussed in @xcite . ) we therefore have secondarily :    * problem 1@xmath68 : find all conditions on the sides under which the quadrilateral arrangement becomes non - degenerate flexible .",
    "* to understand flexibility , we follow bricard and ask       * problem : when is one of these variables , @xmath69 , say , + ( 1 ) a rational function of another @xmath70 , or + ( 2 ) a rational function of both of the other ones @xmath71 ? *   +   +    using resultants , we will show in our main theorem ( section 5 ) that flexibility always implies the second case .",
    "the first case is referred to as _ splitting . _    to make sense of  rational function \" we must discuss the ground field , .",
    "let  be a field",
    ". in many of our algebraic results ,  could be any field of characteristic not 2 .",
    "however , eventually we will evaluate expressions like those in ( [ eq : e4 ] ) by substituting each parameter with an element of .",
    "therefore  = a subfield of  is appropriate .",
    "we do not allow the sides to be arbitrary complex numbers .",
    "then given , we may first think of the ground ring as @xmath72 $ ] and the ground field  as @xmath73 , the field of rational functions over  of the fifteen parameters .",
    "however , the ground field is really  = @xmath74 , where the fifteen parameters are replaced with their definitions in ( [ eq : e4 ] ) above .",
    "this means that large polynomials in the fifteen @xmath75 must sometimes be thought of as even larger polynomials in the eleven @xmath76 .",
    "the evaluation homomorphism , obtained by substituting parameters with values in , can be thought of as a map from  to itself .",
    "also , when we speak of finding a solution to the system @xmath58 , we understand as usual that the common root may lie in an extension field of the ground field , for example , a radical extension .",
    "we can now specify what we mean in problem 1 by  find conditions on the sides under which the quadrilateral arrangement becomes flexible .",
    "\" we mean find substitutions of the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , so that the @xmath36 are continuous functions from some interval to .",
    "we will show that this notion of  condition \" does indeed lead to both old and new flexibile arrangements .",
    "that in turn suggests :    * problem 3 : can all flexible cases be represented by a table of substitutions in this sense ? *    we will see in the conclusion that , very surprisingly , this is false , and we conjecture a modification of it .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section three we develop three lemmas to identify when an equation splits .",
    "the various split cases are summarized in section four . in section five",
    "we present the main theorem , which solves problem 2 and says that if no equation splits , then every @xmath36 is a rational function of the other two . in section six",
    "we complete the theory of the non - split case . in section seven",
    "we describe the software results and two surprising new flexible cases for the quadrilaterals that were apparently unknown to bricard .    in all of the following definitions , lemmas , and theorems we assume flexibility .",
    "some of them are true without this assumption , but we are not concerned with that .",
    "* definition : _ we say that one of the equations @xmath79 _ splits _ or _ decomposes _ if one of the @xmath36 in it can be expressed as a rational function of the other one . _ *    for simplicity , let s concentrate on solving for @xmath69 in equation @xmath80 .",
    "suppose in @xmath80 we have @xmath81 .",
    "then ( 1 ) reduces to @xmath82 since @xmath83 can not be 0 , we can solve this for @xmath69 and obtain a rational function , so @xmath80 would split .",
    "this example is an important case in the following lemmas .    assuming that @xmath84 or @xmath85",
    ", it is natural to solve for @xmath69 using the quadratic formula .",

    "if this is truly a quadratic in @xmath104 and a perfect square then its discriminant must be 0 .",
    "but when the parameters @xmath105 are replaced with their expressions ( [ eq : e4 ] ) in terms of the eleven sides @xmath106 , the discriminant simplifies enormously to @xmath107 .",

    "we now have that @xmath110 if this is a perfect square , then it equals some @xmath111 .",
