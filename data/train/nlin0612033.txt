    "shell models of turbulence @xcite serve a useful purpose in studying the statistical properties of turbulent fields due to their relative ease of simulation .",

    "this problem does not exist in shell models @xcite , adding to their numerical attractiveness a possibility to prove various properties and results rigorously @xcite .",
    "consider for example the sabra shell model @xcite which , like other shell models of turbulence , is a truncated description of the dynamics of fourier modes , preserving some of the structure and conservation laws of the navier - stokes equations : @xmath0+f_n \\ . \\label{sabra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and the boundary conditions @xmath3 , are the velocity modes restricted to ` wavevectors ' @xmath4 with @xmath5 determined by the inverse outer scale of turbulence .",
    "the model contains one additional parameter , @xmath6 , and it conserves two quadratic invariants ( when the force and the dissipation term are absent ) for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "the first is the total energy @xmath7 and the second is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling exponents are properties of the structure functions . to define the structure function we introduce an average over time according to @xmath10 in practice , however , we take @xmath11 for some @xmath12 large enough , but finite .",
    "our rigorous results also refer to this definition of an average over time . for values of the viscosity @xmath13 small enough , and for a sufficiently large amplitude of the random force @xmath14 there exists a large range of values @xmath15 where numerical simulations show that structure functions follow a power - law behavior .",
    "the low - order structure functions and the associated scaling exponents are @xmath16 the values of the scaling exponents were determined accurately by direct numerical simulations . besides @xmath17 which is exactly unity @xcite , all the other exponents @xmath18 appear anomalous , differing from @xmath19 .",
    "numerical evidence is that the scaling exponents are also universal , i.e. they are independent of the forcing @xmath14 as long as the latter is restricted to small @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for @xmath21 the leading scaling exponents are determined by the cascade of the energy invariant from large to small scales .",
    "for @xmath22 the second invariant @xmath8 becomes important in determining the leading scaling exponents of the structure functions of @xmath1 . in the bulk of this paper we consider the situation with @xmath21 , but return to the other case in sect .",
    "[ 2d ] , in order to clarify the role of invariants in determining the scaling properties .    in a recent publication further insight to the anomaly of the exponents of the nonlinear problem ( for the field @xmath1 )",
    "was sought by relating them to the scaling exponents of a _ linear _ model for a field @xmath23 .",
    "the linear model was constructed such that its scaling exponents should be the same as those of the nonlinear problem .",
    "the equations for this field are constructed under the following requirements : ( i ) the structure of the equations is obtained by linearizing the nonlinear problem and retaining only such terms that conserve the energy ; ( ii ) the resulting equation is identical with the sabra model when @xmath24 ; ( iii ) the energy is the only quadratic invariant for the passive field in the absence of forcing and dissipation .",
    "these requirements lead to the following linear model : @xmath25 where the advection term is defined as @xmath26\\nonumber\\\\ & & + k_{n}[(1 - 2\\delta)u_{n-1}^*w_{n+1}-(1+\\delta)u_{n+1}w_{n-1}^*]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + k_{n-1}[(2-\\delta)u_{n-1}w_{n-2}+(1 - 2\\delta)u_{n-2}w_{n-1 } ] \\ , \\label{bilinear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with @xmath27 .",
    "observe that when @xmath24 this model reproduces the sabra model , and also that the total energy is conserved because @xmath28 = 0 $ ] .",
    "the second quadratic invariant is not conserved by the linear model ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "finally , both models have the same ` phase symmetry ' in the sense that the phase transformations @xmath29 and @xmath30 leave the equations invariant iff @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "this identical phase relationship guarantees that the non - vanishing correlation functions of both models have precisely the same forms .",
    "thus for example the only second and third correlation functions in both models are those written explicitly in eqs .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) and ( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the linear model is that correlation functions are advanced in time by a linear propagator @xcite .",
    "the linear model possesses  statistically preserved structures \" ( sps ) which are evident in the decaying problem eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) with @xmath33 .",
    "these are _ left _ eigenfunctions of eigenvalue 1 of the linear propagators for each order ( decaying ) correlation function @xcite .",
    "for example for the second order correlation function denote the propagator @xmath34 ; this operator propagates any initial condition @xmath35 ( with average over initial conditions , independent of the realizations of the advecting field @xmath1 ) to the decaying correlation function ( with average over realizations of the advecting field @xmath1 ) @xmath36 the second order sps , @xmath37 , is the left eigenfunction with eigenvalue 1 , @xmath38 note that @xmath37 is time independent even though the operator @xmath34 is time dependent .",
    "each order correlation function is associated with another propagator @xmath39 and each of those has an sps , i.e. a _ left _",
    "eigenfunction @xmath40 of eigenvalue 1 .",
    "these non - decaying eigenfunctions scale with @xmath15 , @xmath41 , and the values of the exponents @xmath42 are anomalous .",
    "finally , it was shown that these sps are also the leading scaling contributions to the structure functions of the _ forced _ problem ( [ lin ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus * the scaling exponents of the linear problem are independent of the forcing @xmath14 * , since they are determined by the sps of the decaying problem .    to connect the linear model to the nonlinear problem one considers the system of two coupled equations @xmath43 with @xmath44 being a real parameter and @xmath14 and @xmath45 being different realizations of the same random force .",
    "observe that for any @xmath46 , the two equations in ( [ system ] ) exchange roles under the change @xmath47 .",
    "thus if the scaling exponents @xmath42 and @xmath18 of the two fields exist ( i.e. a true scaling range exists ) , they must be the same for all @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath48 we recover the equations for the nonlinear and the linear models , eqs .",

    "in @xcite it was _ assumed _ that the scaling exponents of either field exhibits no jump in the limit @xmath49 .",

    "@xcite also presented strong evidence for the validity of this assumption ( see fig .",
    "[ lambdato0 ] ) , but no mathematical proof was provided .",

    "the main result of our paper states that the solutions of the system ( [ system ] ) exist globally in time and depend continuously on the parameter @xmath44 , including the limit @xmath50 .",
    "in particular we will show that _ if _ the structure function of @xmath1 and @xmath23 exhibit the same scaling exponents for any @xmath46 , they will also have the same scaling exponents in the limit @xmath49 ( including @xmath48 ) .",
    "we would like to stress here that our rigorous results are valid for the structure functions , calculated over large , but finite , fixed interval of time , which is consistent with the definition ( [ average ] ) of the long time average .",
    "in addition , we would like to note that the numerical results correspond to the equations with the stochastic implementation of the forcing , while our rigorous proofs deal with the deterministic force that depend on time .",
