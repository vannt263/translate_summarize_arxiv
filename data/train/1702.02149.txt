    "the high precision timing solutions for pulsars in 47 tuc have been possible due to a long dedicated observation campaign for several decades with the parkes radio telescope@xcite .",
    "we use the updated timing solutions in the extended table 1@xcite .",
    "based on the observed number of pulsars , the total predicted number of neutron stars in the cluster may change between 200 - 1500 due to the integrated uncertainties in the luminosity distribution , beaming , flux densities , spectral indices of pulsars ; and the initial mass function , binary fraction , encounter rate , scintillation properties of the cluster .",
    "our n - body simulations with a @xmath21 retention fraction predict @xmath221000 neutron stars in 47 tuc .",
    "a grid of several hundred @xmath5-body simulations of star clusters , varying the initial density profile of the cluster , it s initial half - mass radius and the mass ratio of the black hole to the total cluster mass ( @xmath23 ) were used for our study@xcite .",
    "all simulations were produced using the gpu - enabled version of the collisional @xmath5-body code nbody6 @xcite which includes two - body relaxation , tidal fields , fitting formula for the modeling of stellar and binary - stellar evolution .",
    "the simulations were run up to t=11.75 gyr , the age of 47 tuc@xcite , and then scaled to have the same half - mass radius as 47 tuc@xcite.the best - fitting models to the surface density and velocity dispersion profiles of 47 tuc were determined with a @xmath24 test .",
    "all simulations were run with 100,000 particles except the simulations with 0.5% imbhs which used 200,000 particles@xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are king ( 1962 ) models with initial concentrations of @xmath25=0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 and 2.5 .",
    "these values cover the observed concentrations of galactic globular clusters@xcite .",
    "initial relaxation times of the n - body models range from 300 myr to 12 gyr with a half - mass radius @xmath26=2 pc to @xmath26=35 pc .",
    "it is unlikely that 47 tuc has started with a half - mass relaxation time outside this range since this would require that the cluster started with either a mass or half - mass radius very different from that of observed clusters .",
    "also we find that the best - fitting n - body models are well inside the trial grid away from the edges in the parameter space .",
    "all models were isolated .",
    "imbhs influence mainly the core of a star cluster and the dynamics in the core are hardly influenced by tidal effects .",
    "therefore , the use of isolated models is justified .",
    "the black hole was treated as a massive star in the simulations .",
    "so the imbh was not fixed in these simulations and was allowed to wander stochastically around in the core .",
    "all models became mass segregated , the amount of mass segregation depending on the initial half - mass relaxation time and initial concentration of the model . during the simulations , stellar mass black holes form from stellar evolution ,",
    "concentrate near the imbh due to mass segregation , and then kick each other out due to close encounters .",
    "stellar mass black holes have kicked each other out by t=11.75 gyr in all simulations , except those with the largest relaxation times where only a handful remain .",
    "models with black hole masses of 1% of the cluster mass deviate significantly from the observed density profile of 47 tuc .",
    "the discrepancy is strongest for radii around 10@xmath27 where the observed density profile has a near constant density core .",
    "a near constant density profile at this distance is in good agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "the 1% imbh model also has a strong central rise in the velocity dispersion profile which is not seen in the observations .",
    "we expect that both problems would become even more pronounced for more massive black holes .",
    "hence the presence of black holes with mass equal to or larger than @xmath221% of the cluster mass ( @xmath228000 @xmath28 ) can already be excluded .",
    "the 0.5% imbh model leads to a better fit of the observational data . at the core of the cluster within 5@xmath27 ,",
    "the surface density of the 0.5% imbh model is compatible with the observed density profile . only at distances beyond",
    "r@xmath2210@xmath27 the surface density of the model cluster is @xmath2920% lower than the observed profile .",
    "such differences could be attributed to the uncertainties in the mass function and binary fractions in 47 tuc@xcite .",
    "primordial binaries are expected to play an important role in the early evolution of the cluster core@xcite . for 47 tuc",
    ", it has been estimated that primordial binaries may have pushed the core radii up to an additional 20% during the early stages of the evolution@xcite .    in order to comparatively study the possible effects of primordial binaries onto the current mass segregation , we ran additional simulations for three different model clusters .",
    "the mass function , neutron star and black hole retention fractions were kept consistent with other runs .",
    "these simulations base code was the gpu enabled nbody6 with a hermite integration scheme for variable time steps@xcite .",
    "this integration scheme applies chain regularization@xcite in order to have sufficient time resolution to follow the tight orbits of binaries and their close encounters with other stars over the cluster lifetime .",
    "our first cluster was evolved with 10% primordial binaries .",
    "we took a snapshot of that simulation at t=11.75 gyr by which time almost half of all stars left the cluster and the global binary fraction went down to 7% .",
    "the fraction of binaries within 50% of the projected half - light radius increased to 15% at this time , fully consistent with observations of 47 tuc@xcite .",
    "we compare this with snapshots of the other two simulations , one without primordial binaries and the other with a 0.5% imbh model .",
    "all snapshots are taken at the same time of their evolution and scaled by their projected half - light radii to compare their stellar distributions .",
    "extended data figure 1 shows clearly that the presence of primordial binaries does not play a significant role in shaping the current mass segregation profile of massive stars . once the imbh forms",
    ", it becomes the dominant driver of the cluster core dynamics .",
    "the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence ( @xmath12 ) provides a mathematically robust approach for a comprehensive treatment of the acceleration distributions@xcite .",
    "@xmath12 quantifies the entropy between two distributions .",
    "specifically , @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath30[log@xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the expectation value and @xmath13 is the likelihood .",
    "this likelihood value has a trivial numeric relation to the measured ( @xmath33 ) and simulated ( @xmath34 ) pulsar accelerations , which then can be calculated given that the information entropy is    @xmath35",
    "the measured spin - down rates ( @xmath36 ) of galactic millisecond pulsars can be used as a proxy to disentangle the overall potential contribution of the intrinsic spin - down ( @xmath37 ) to the measured apparent accelerations . for pulsars in globular clusters @xmath38 because @xmath36 is modified by the cluster potential .",
    "the acceleration due to the cluster potential is @xmath39    the variation in the pulsar magnetospheric geometry , formation channels and internal structure ( i.e. , moment of inertia ) , which determine @xmath37 , are expected to be similar for pulsars in clusters and the galactic disk .",
    "therefore , the @xmath37 distribution of pulsars in clusters should be comparable to the @xmath36 distribution of galactic pulsars .",
    "hence , we use the two - dimensional observed period - spin down ( @xmath40 ) distribution of galactic pulsars to infer the possible range for the intrinsic spin - down contribution to pulsars accelerations in 47 tuc@xcite .",
    "the level of uncertainty due to the unknown contribution of the intrinsic @xmath41 to the measured pulsar accelerations are represented with different shades in extended data figure 2 .",
    "because the intrinsic @xmath41 of pulsars are not known , we treat the observed range of @xmath42 and @xmath41 of galactic millisecond pulsars as a distribution of values to offset the intrinsic contribution to the measured acceleration . instead of assuming a single acceleration term",
    ", we use the 68% , 95% , and a 99% probable intervals for the range of acceleration values corresponding to each pulsar in 47 tuc .",
    "we use the kinematic centre ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) = ( @xmath45,@xmath46 ) of 47 tuc@xcite for our calculations .",
    "the uncertainty in the centre is about @xmath47 in each coordinate@xcite . in order to study the potential contribution of an asymmetry to our calculations , we randomly shift the cluster centre within the error box and re - calculate the black hole mass with randomly selected pulsars for many bootstrap cycles .",
    "we find that the effect of uncertainty in the cluster centre to the inferred black hole mass is less than 5% .",
    "the simulations@xcite were produced with the gpu - enabled version of the collisional @xmath5-body code nbody6@xcite publicly available online at this http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm[url ] .",
    "the authors are happy to provide further details for reproducing the simulations .",
