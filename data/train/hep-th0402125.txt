    "in `` braneworld '' models , our universe is represented by a @xmath0-dimensional brane floating in a higher - dimensional bulk spacetime  @xcite",
    ". the brane can be thought of as fundamental @xmath1-brane , or it can arise as a topological defect in a higher - dimensional field theory . in the simplest , codimension - one models ,",
    "the brane can be pictured as a domain wall propagating in a 5d spacetime  @xcite .",
    "higher codimensions with both gauge and global defects have also been considered . in particular ,",
    "models have been discussed where the field configuration in the directions orthogonal to the brane is that of a cosmic string  @xcite and a monopole  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the bulk curvature produced by the defects plays a major role in localizing gravity on the brane and in solving the mass - hierarchy problem .",
    "recently , the author investigated localization of gravity in a different type of defect , the `` texture ''  @xcite .",
    "global textures are produced when a continuous global symmetry @xmath2 is broken to a group @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting homotopy group @xmath4 is nontrivial , and the vacuum manifold is @xmath5 ; for @xmath6 models , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the mapping from the physical space to the vacuum manifold is @xmath9  @xcite .    for textures ,",
    "the scalar field takes only the vacuum - expectation value after the symmetry breaking , and thus nowhere in the physical space remains the scalar field in the unbroken - symmetry state .",
    "this is the key difference between textures and core defects .",
    "let us consider a global o(2 ) texture formed in five dimensions . in the mapping @xmath10",
    ", we identify the physical space @xmath11 with the extra dimensional space .",
    "after the scalar field completes its winding in the vacuum manifold , two spatial points on the boundaries of the physical space are mapped into the same point in the vacuum manifold .",
    "these two points are identified , and the extra dimension becomes compact .",
    "the extra dimension is curved by the texture .",
    "the strength of the curvature depends on the symmetry - breaking scale of the texture .",
    "this curved geometry of the extra dimension sets the particle hierarchy as well as the planck - mass hierarchy in the extra dimension .",
    "thus , the role of the cosmological constant in the randall - sundrum scenario  @xcite is replaced by the texture .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigated `` flat 3-branes '' embedded in a texture where the 4d worldsheet is represented by a flat 4d metric .",
    "the model has two 3-branes of nonzero tension .",
    "the one has a positive , and the other has a negative tension .",
    "the particle - hierarchy scale between the two branes is determined solely by the symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "gravity on the brane where tev - scale particles are confined is essentially four dimensional .",
    "the higher dimensional effect of massive kaluza - klein gravitons is strongly suppressed on this brane .",
    "this result is similar to that of ref .",
    ".    one crucial problem of this model was that there exists a tachyonic 4d graviton mode . due to this mode , the direction tangent to the brane is unstable although in the end it is expected to relax to a final stable configuration after some dynamical evolution combined with the texture field along the orthogonal direction .    in this work ,",
    "we are particularly interested in the mechanism to stabilize the branes in gravitational perturbations . as a recipe , we introduce `` inflation '' on 4d worldsheets . in doing so ,",
    "we effectively add vacuum energy induced by the bulk curvature .",
    "when this energy compensates the energy deficit due to the tachyon , we expect that the branes stabilize .",
    "the scale of required vacuum energy in stabilizing the branes is also of much concern .",
    "the expansion due to this energy should not be very large to be consistent with the acceleration of the late universe .",
