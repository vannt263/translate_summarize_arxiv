    "taking the first step as an example , this follows from the form given by ( [ sav1 ] ) : @xmath294 * the finite constituent quark mass @xmath132 causes mixing of operators with opposite chirality in the integral equation ( [ si1 ] ) : we remind that the dirac matrices @xmath295 and @xmath296 of ( [ vplus ] ) and ( [ aplus ] ) are chiral even ( anticommute with @xmath297 ) , while @xmath298 of ( [ tplusi ] ) is chiral odd ( commutes with @xmath297 ) .",

    "for the description of quark ffs , however , one has to consider multi - fragmentation processes , where the quark produces a cascade of mesons .",
    "one purpose of this paper was therefore to formulate the tmd jet model , which is suitable for numerical calculations in effective quark theories . limiting ourselves to the case of inclusive pion production for simplicity and clarity , we used a product ansatz for the tmd ff , similar to that used by field and feynman for the description of longitudinal quark jets@xcite . from this product ansatz",
    "we derived the integral equations for the spin independent and quark - spin dependent ffs .",
    "the proper treatment of the spin of the quarks in the intermediate states requires the use of several elementary tmd splitting functions in the integral equations .",
    "we found that these integral equations are coupled to each other , that is , the spin independent and quark - spin dependent ffs are mutually interrelated .",
    "we showed that in this tmd jet model all momentum and isospin sum rules are satisfied .",

    "the numerical solutions of the integral equations derived in this paper , using model input splitting functions , will allow to obtain the relevant ffs in future work .",

    "the quantities @xmath418 of the @xmath152th step ( @xmath419 ) denote the average polarization of @xmath420 determined by the functions @xmath421 of the @xmath156th step .",
    "we now insert the form ( [ fg ] ) for each factor @xmath422 of ( [ ansatz0 ] ) and sum over the directions of @xmath417 , where @xmath419 . as a result ,",
    "the factor @xmath423 in @xmath424 of ( [ fg ] ) is replaced by unity , while the spin sum over @xmath425 gives the function ( [ qqunpol ] ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that all products with the same number ( call it @xmath8 ) of @xmath426 and @xmath427 number of @xmath428 make the same contribution to @xmath429 .",
    "we therefore can introduce an ordering of the factors in ( [ ansatz0 ] ) , so that the first @xmath8 @xmath430 s not equal to one ( @xmath431 ) , and the remaining @xmath430 s equal to one ( @xmath432 ) , multiply the combinatoric factor @xmath433 and perform a sum over @xmath8 . for some fixed @xmath8 , only the terms with @xmath434 will contribute to the sum in ( [ ansatz0 ] ) , because @xmath160 in ( [ zm ] ) must be non - zero . then eq.([ansatz0 ] ) becomes @xmath435 here we use the same notation as in the main text for the spin averages , i.e. , @xmath155 for the @xmath152th step ( @xmath419 ) means the average polarization of @xmath420 determined by the renormalized function @xmath436 of the @xmath156th step .",
    "the binomial distribution @xmath437 is the probability of producing @xmath8 mesons out of a maximum of @xmath174 mesons and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath438 for a fixed @xmath209 in ( [ ansatz01 ] ) , we can integrate over the variables @xmath210 and @xmath211 for @xmath439 by using the normalization ( [ fnorm ] ) .",
    "then , for all @xmath440 , only the integrations over the same set of variables @xmath441 and @xmath442 for @xmath443 remain , and the sum over @xmath8 refers only to the probabilities @xmath444 .",
    "the integrations over the variables @xmath445 are then performed by using the delta functions . making a shift @xmath215 , and following similar steps as in ( [ intm ] ) of the main text ,",
    "the result of these integrations is @xmath446 where the renormalized elementary @xmath133 splitting function @xmath447 is given by @xmath448 in this way , the function @xmath217 of eq.([ansatz01 ] ) becomes @xmath449 in order to obtain a recursion relation for the functions @xmath219 , we carry out the following steps : ) , ( [ neq1 ] ) from ( [ ansatz2 ] ) . ]",
    "first , we make shifts of the integration variables @xmath450 according to @xmath451 with @xmath452 . using these relations recursively , the argument of the function @xmath453 in ( [ ansatz02 ] ) becomes @xmath454 in this way , eq.([ansatz02 ] ) can be written as @xmath455 second , we replace @xmath456 in ( [ ansatz03 ] ) to obtain an expression for @xmath457 . in this expression , rename the integration variables as @xmath458 , and similarly for the tm .",
    "also , rename the quark flavors as @xmath459 .",
    "third , in the expression ( [ ansatz03 ] ) for @xmath217 , use the following identities : @xmath460 in ( [ delta2 ] ) we used @xmath461 from ( [ delta1 ] ) .",
    "following the three steps explained above , we obtain the following recursion relation for @xmath217 : @xmath462 while for @xmath164 we have @xmath463 the ratios @xmath464 for @xmath465 are defined as @xmath466 the total ff then becomes @xmath467 it can be seen from this relation that the sum rules are not satisfied if the maximum number of mesons ( @xmath174 ) is finite@xcite . as we explain in the main text",
    ", we consider the limit @xmath143 , where the following relation is satisfied : @xmath468 [ we remind that , according to the moivre - laplace theorem , in the limit @xmath141 the binomial distribution @xmath444 of ( [ bino ] ) becomes a normal ( gauss ) distribution with the same mean value ( equal to @xmath469 ) and variance ( equal to @xmath470 ) .",
    "] it then follows from ( [ total ] ) and ( [ recurs01 ] ) that the ff satisfies the following integral equation in the limit @xmath141 : @xmath471 which is the same as ( [ recurs ] ) of the main text .",
    "in this appendix we wish to show that , after @xmath141 fragmentation steps , the mean isospin @xmath2-component and the mean tm of the quark remainder are zero . these results are confirmed in the main part ( sect .",
    "iii.d . ) , and for clarity we present alternative proofs in this appendix .",
    "denote by @xmath472 the probability that , after @xmath174 emission of pions , the isospin z - component of the quark is the same as that of the initial quark . because in each emission step , the probability that the quark isospin z - component changes is equal to @xmath473 and that it does not change is equal to @xmath474 , we obtain the recursion relation @xmath475 this can be solved with the initial condition @xmath476 as @xmath477 this shows that in the limit @xmath141 @xmath472 becomes @xmath478 , i.e. , that quark remainder has equal probabilities for isospin z - component @xmath479 , and therefore its mean isospin z - component must be zero .",
    "more explicitly , if @xmath480 is the isospin z - component of the initial quark , then after @xmath174 emission steps the quark has average isospin z - component @xmath481 which vanishes in the limit @xmath141 .      according to our product ansatz ( iii.6 ) , the probability for a fragmentation chain",
    "is given by the products of elementary @xmath367 splitting functions .",
    "the delta - functions in ( iii.6 ) select a meson which is produced in the @xmath209-th step , and the summation over @xmath209 gives the probability for semi - inclusive pion production . instead of selecting the pions",
    ", we now select the final quark by the delta functions . because we are interested in the isoscalar case , we sum over the flavors of the final quark .",
    "this gives for the probability density of @xmath482 @xmath483 because each factor has the flavor dependence ( [ isivqq ] ) , it is easy to see that , after the flavor summations , all elementary functions should be replaced by the isoscalar functions @xmath484 .",
    "the mean tm of the quark remainder is obtained by multiplying ( [ prodf ] ) by @xmath258 and integrating over @xmath2 and @xmath258 .",
    "this gives @xmath485 where now all functions in the product refer to the isoscalar part of the elementary @xmath87 splitting function .",
    "next we use the shifts of integration variables ( [ trans ] ) for all @xmath486 . using these relations recursively , as explained in ( [ shiftp ] ) , to express @xmath487 by the new variables , we obtain @xmath488",
    "remember that the function for the @xmath88th step in this product has the form ( [ qqunpol ] ) @xmath489     \\label{drive}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath490 .",
    "also , remember that for @xmath491 in the function for the @xmath492 step we have the recursion relation ( see eq .",
    "( [ sav ] ) )      where the vector @xmath494 is defined by @xmath495 if @xmath496 .",
    "( we also remind that longitudinal quark polarizations do not contribute to inclusive pion production , and therefore all spin vectors of this appendix can be replaced by their transverse parts . )",
    "consider now the integral over @xmath497 in the second term of @xmath498 in ( [ prod2 ] ) . here",
    "only the spin independent term @xmath499 of the @xmath174th factor in the product ( [ prod2 ] ) contributes , which gives the longitudinal momentum fraction left to the quark in one step .",
    "we denote this by @xmath500 , where clearly @xmath501 .",
    "for example , using the model forms of appendix c for the case of ps coupling , we have @xmath502 ^ 2 } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\left(\\int_0 ^ 1 { \\rm d}\\eta \\ , \\eta   \\int { \\rm d}^2 p_{\\perp } \\ , \\frac{{\\bf p}_{\\perp}^2 + m^2 \\eta^2 } { \\left[{\\bf p}_{\\perp}^2 + m^2 \\eta^2 + ( 1-\\eta ) m_{\\pi}^2\\right]^2 } \\right)^{-1 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the third term in @xmath498 of ( [ prod2 ] ) we can carry out the integrations over @xmath503 and @xmath504 to get a factor @xmath505 , and so on",
    ". therefore eq.([prod2 ] ) can be written as @xmath506 where we defined the integrals @xmath507 by @xmath508 these integrals can be evaluated in closed form by using ( [ drive ] ) and ( [ savf ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath509 where we defined the constant @xmath355 by @xmath510 the constant @xmath292 was defined already in ( [ y ] ) , where it was shown that @xmath511 , and that @xmath292 has the physical meaning of the quark depolarization factor for one fragmentation step .",
    "the tm of the quark remainder is then finally obtained from ( [ last1 ] ) as @xmath512 where we used @xmath513 and @xmath511 .",
    "we finally note that for the elementary process the average tm of the final quark is given by @xmath514 , which is nonzero .",
    "it is only after an infinite chain of fragmentation processes that the average tm of the final quark becomes zero . as we noted already in the main text ,",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuation @xmath103 is nonzero .",
