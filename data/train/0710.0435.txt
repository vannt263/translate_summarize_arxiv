    "recent years saw increased interest and activities in understanding the nature and dynamics of entanglement in quantum systems .",
    "this is a distinctly quantum feature absent in classical systems , also the most essential factor in demonstrating the capability of any proposed quantum computer scheme .",
    "many theoretical studies of quantum entanglement have been carried out for two level systems in atoms , quantum dots and superconductors with charges , spins and fluxes .",
    "entanglement between qubits ( quantum two - level systems ) as mediated by a quantum fields is also of interest because of realistic experimental needs .",
    "this aspect has been considered by one of us and collaborators in popular models such as atoms in a cavity field ( see @xcite for two qubits in two separate fields and @xcite in one quantum field ) and two brownian oscillators in a finite temperature bath ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "associated with the dynamics of entanglement are the older issues of quantum decoherence and entropy / information evolution .",
    "entanglement between two qubits is measured effectively by the concurrence functions @xcite , the entropy of formation , fidelity and purity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "investigation of these issues are pursued most actively today in the area of quantum information .",
    "another area where questions of quantum entanglement , entropy and information are raised is in black hole physics and quantum gravity , where fundamental issues about the laws of physics and the structure of spacetime are of interest .",
    "bekenstein s proposal of black hole entropy @xcite and hawking s discovery @xcite that black hole emits thermal radiance raise the question of how the end state of a black hole is like , and ushered in the debate whether there is net information lost in a black hole @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview ) and , by proxy , whether unitarity in the laws of physics is violated .",
    "there are many proposed explanations ",
    "remnants , naked singularity , baby universe formation or complete evaporation .",
    "( see e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "we will focus on one explanation which bears on some of the issues in quantum coherence and information mentioned above , namely , that information in the black hole is not lost but transferred and dispersed into the quantum field through hawking radiation .",
    "many authors have proposed or hinted on this view , approached from different angles , some more explicitly than others , ranging from quantum gravity , string theory , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum information . out of these",
    "we shall focus on the themes of two papers @xcite ( which are shared in varying degrees by other authors , see papers cited above ) .",
    "for some recent discussions with newer perspectives , see e.g. , @xcite from string theory and nonlocality viewpoints , @xcite from loop quantum gravity and @xcite for a quantum information approach to this issue .    in ref .",
    "@xcite anglin _ et al .",
    "_ studied a simple model of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a quantum field and analyzed the decoherence and recoherence of the detector in the ultraweak coupling approximation .",
    "they claimed that , as soon as the coupling is switched on , the oscillator loses the quantum coherence on a very short decoherence time corresponding to the cut - off time scale .",
    "but all the quantum coherence will recover in the end , after a much longer relaxation time .",
    "the initial information in the oscillator eventually flow into the field side , though appearing in a highly nontrivial form .",
    "they suggest that black hole information could behave in a similar way . in ref .",
    "@xcite one of us described a scenario where information in the black hole is transferred to the quantum field , and proposed to use the correlation functions of an interacting field as registers of information and the dynamics of correlations as a measure of information flow . according to the viewpoint put forth in @xcite , the appearance of information loss is primarily owing to the fact that actual physical measurements are limited in accuracy , i.e.",
    ", one can only access the lowest order correlation functions , beginning with the mean field and the two - point functions .",
    "it also highlights the huge capacity of a quantum field in storing and dispensing information .    in our present work",
    "we adopt some modern methods of quantum information to address some aspects of black hole information issues .",
    "looking at a particle detector in uniform acceleration interacting with a quantum field , we study the quantum entanglement , quantum recoherence and information flow in this simple system with the aim of providing an illustrative example to check on the ideas put forth in @xcite . of the main points made there",
    ", we can confirm that information does flow from the detector to the field and gets propagated to null infinity with the radiation .",
    "further , from the behavior of two - point functions obtained in @xcite , we do not see any qualitative change between the @xmath0 static case and the @xmath1 uniformly accelerated cases .",
    "insofar as the information behavior is concerned the uniformly accelerated cases are closer in nature to the inertial case than those cases with non - uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the cases similar to those considered in @xcite but with a much wider parameter range .",
    "we clarify that , in the ultraweak coupling limit , some level of quantum coherence is recovered at late times , but full recoherence is impossible as long as the coupling is on ; beyond the ultraweak coupling limit , late - time recoherence never occurs . in this study",
    "we show that with new tools adopted from quantum information , even simple models like this can provide valuable insight into deeper issues in statistical mechanical properties of detector ( atom)- field interactions and by suitable extension , black hole spacetime physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce a system with the uniformly accelerated detector ( atom ) coupled with the field . using the exact form of the two - point functions",
    "we demonstrate that already at this stage one can see information flowing from the detector to the field and propagates with the radiation into null infinity . in sec iia",
    "we introduce a quantity called purity and show that it is useful for describing the entanglement and the recoherence dynamics of the system . to obtain the purity function",
    "we calculate the reduced density matrix of the detector in sec .",
    "then in sec.iii we derive analytic expressions for the purity in the detector and deduce the entanglement between the detector and the field , first from the detector s view ( time ) and then from the field s view ( time ) .",
    "this behavior is illustrated with graphs plotted in various parameter ranges . in sec .",
    "iv we make some technical remarks and then give a discussion of the central issues raised here . as a complementary description , in appendix a , we give the reduced density matrix of the field for the same initial state used in sec .",
    "ii . for a detector initially in the ground state the purity of the detector and the purity of the field have simple enough expressions that we can record them in appendix b. finally in appendix c we provide a comparison of our results to the claims of @xcite on the recoherence issue .",
    "consider a harmonic oscillator with bare mass @xmath2 , bare natural frequency @xmath3 and internal degree of freedom @xmath4 ( such as the unruh - dewitt(ud ) detector @xcite in the language of quantum field theory in curved spacetime ) interacting with a massless quantum scalar field @xmath5 in four - dimensional minkowski space with coupling constant @xmath6 .",

    "for the cases of detectors at rest ( @xmath0 ) , we have learnt in @xcite that the two - point functions of our ud detector theory in ( 3 + 1)d with finite @xmath9 have no singular behavior as @xmath10 .",
    "hence all our results below , which are expressed in terms of these two - point functions , apply equally well to the case of detectors at rest .",
    "we study the case when the initial state of the combined system is a direct product of a quantum state @xmath11 for the detector @xmath4 and the minkowski vacuum @xmath12 for the field @xmath5 , @xmath13 oftentimes one hears the comment that since the detector is a harmonic oscillator and the field can be decomposed as a collection of harmonic oscillators , the combined system is just a system of @xmath14 oscillators .",
    "indeed one can diagonalize the ud detector - field system into a system of @xmath14 free harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "but we want to add the warning that the choice of initial conditions for the detector @xmath4 ( such as the ground state ) and for the field @xmath5 ( such as the minkowski vacuum ) separately renders the set - up of this system ( physical variables and initial states ) physically different from that of the system of @xmath14 free harmonic oscillators with choices of the initial states deemed natural for it .",
    "since the combined system is linear , the operators evolve in the heisenberg picture as linear transformations .",
    "for example , the operator of @xmath4 evolves like @xcite @xmath15 \\nonumber\\\\      & & + \\int { d^3 k\\over ( 2\\pi)^3}\\sqrt{\\hbar\\over 2\\omega }      \\left[q^{(+)}(\\tau,{\\bf k})\\hat{b}_{\\bf",

    "when sandwiched by the factorized initial state @xmath22 , the two - point functions of the detector and those of the field split into two parts , e.g. , @xmath23 with @xmath24     \\left [ q^a(\\tau')\\hat{a}+q^{a*}(\\tau')\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\right ]      \\left|\\right.q\\left .",

    "therefore by studying the correlation functions @xmath27 of the detector and those of the field , one can monitor how the information initially in the detector is flowing into the field .    indeed , from ref .",
    "@xcite , we learned that @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 all decay after the coupling is switched on , and the information about the initial state of the detector is subsumed into the quantum field ( in @xmath31 , etc . )",
    "this view is further supported by the the energy conservation law @xcite @xmath32 between the internal energy of the detector ( left hand side ) and the radiated energy of a monopole radiation ( right hand side ) . here",

    "we have done a similar calculation for the detector initially in the second excited state . in the ultraweak coupling limit with sufficiently small @xmath150 , the evolution of purity",

    "thus there is no  transient recoherence \" or intermediate pure state during the spontaneous emission process for the ud detector - field system .",
    "while @xmath202 has the value of @xmath203 , which makes the detector look like it is in its first excited state , the detector is actually in a mixture of the second , the first and the ground state since @xmath132 is large then .",
    "the oscillating mean field emitted by the detector is a manifestation of quantum superposition of energy eigenstates inside the detector , but the converse is not true .",
    "an example is that if the initial state of the detector is a superposition of its ground state and the second excited state , the mean field emitted by the detector is always zero .",
    "one may ask whether the mean field carries  quantum information \" rather than a classical one .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath4 and @xmath204 and the mean field actually enter into the energy conservation law @xmath38 between the internal energy of the detector and the radiated energy of a monopole radiation emitted by the detector .",
    "as far as the energy balance is concerned there is no essential difference between the mean field and the classical field . from this view",
    "the mean field carries no quantum information .    to determine the initial state of the detector from the evolving quantum field ,",
    "an observer without any _ a priori _ knowledge about the set - up has to find out the correlation functions to all orders , even though in the problem at hand only the one - point ( mean field ) and two - point functions of the detector and those of the field are sufficient as they contain the full information about the combined system .",
    "this is because the ud detector theory is linear and so all higher - order correlation functions can be written as combinations of these lower - order functions .",
    "as long as the coupling between the detector and the field is on , the detector and the field are separately in a mixed state of its own , while the combined system remains in a pure state .",
    "the mixed state of the detector carries information of the initial state until @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 all decay away and the detector reaches a steady state . at late times , while the energy eigenstates of the free detector can not form a good basis , the rdm of the detector can be diagonalized to a boltzmann distribution from which one can read off the same effective temperature as those reported in @xcite . in this sense",
    "the final mixed state of the detector is a thermal state containing no initial information .",
    "this is true for both inertial and uniformly accelerating detectors , the former case might be a surprise .",
    "the case of a uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski space is analogous to the case of a detector sitting outside a schwarzschild black hole at a fixed radial distance . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that the information about the initial state of the detector will be carried in ( quantum ) radiation emitted and propagated to the future null infinity @xmath208 of minkowski space , and all the radiation containing those information eventually cross the event horizon of the detector . in the black hole case , by contrast ,",
    "a quick estimate indicates that not all , but about one half , of the radiation emitted from the detector will enter the event horizon of the black hole , while the remaining radiation goes outwards to @xmath208 .",
    "the exact ratio between the inward and outward radiations depends on the gray body factor of the black hole and could be obtained only by detailed calculations .",
    "now consider the situation that , besides this fixed detector , there is another detector carrying some information and falling into the black hole .",
    "one may ask how information might flow from the free - falling detector to the fixed one , and how the correlations between these two detectors evolve .",
    "it is also interesting to look into the way how the quantum field aids in the propagation of information and the evolution of those correlations .",
    "we will answer these questions in a forthcoming paper .",
    "another avenue to connect with the black hole problem is to treat the detector itself as an analog of the black hole .",
    "this follows bekenstein s observation that the black hole behaves like an ensemble of quantum mechanical atoms @xcite , whose spontaneous emissions correspond to hawking radiation , and the energy level of the atom is analogous to the area level of the black hole .",
    "when they are fed with field quanta , black holes tend to absorb more than emit energy .",
    "indeed , bekenstein and meisels showed that for black holes the einstein b coefficient for stimulated absorption is greater than the coefficient for stimulated emission @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the theory for black hole atoms does not violate unitarity and there is no information loss , just like our ud detector theory .",
    "then our results for @xmath0 indicate that , if the field is initially in a vacuum state , the information about the black hole will be encoded in its spontaneous emission , namely , its emitted radiation which is not exactly thermal .",
    "all initial information in the black hole will eventually go to the field at late times , while the final state of the black hole is sustained by the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum field .",
    "this is consistent with the  no - hiding theorem \" of braunstein and pati ( with their ancilla as our quantum field ) @xcite : no information is hidden in the correlations between the field and the black hole .",
    "one can further verify this statement by noting that the correlation functions @xmath209 for all @xmath210 vanish at late times .",
    "when the black hole is radiating , the black hole itself and the field outside the black hole are each in a mixed state . only in the ultraweak coupling limit",
    "can they restore most of their purity at late times .",
    "otherwise , in the more prevalent non - markovian regime , the area eigenstates of the black hole can not form a good basis , and the entanglement between the black hole and the field is always large .",
    "nevertheless , in this scenario the quantum state of the combined system is always pure due to the unitarity we assumed .    in our model the difference between the degrees of freedom of the detector and those of the field",
    "is put in by hand and never disappears , and we can not address whether the ground state corresponds to a black hole remnant , an ordinary localized mass , or nothing . however , in bekenstein s atom analog highly excited eigenstates correspond to large - area black holes .",
    "our results indicate that in the rather general non - markovian regime , the combined system would evolve to a highly entangled state between the black hole and the field , and the final state of the black hole would be a complicated mixed state distributed widely from the ground state to the highly excited area - eigenstates .",
    "so at late times in the broad ranged non - markovian regime the black hole could end up as a remnant with a large mean area with all its initial information already leaked out and dispersed into the quantum field . + * acknowledgement * syl wishes to thank zheng - yao su for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> we study an exactly solvable model where an uniformly accelerated detector is linearly coupled to a massless scalar field initially in the minkowski vacuum . using the exact correlation functions obtained in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we show that as soon as the coupling is switched on one can see information flowing from the detector to the field and propagating with the radiation into null infinity . by expressing the reduced density matrix of the detector in terms of the two - point functions , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the purity function in the detector and study the evolution of quantum entanglement between the detector and the field . only in the ultraweak coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> could some degree of recoherence in the detector appear at late times , but never in full restoration . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly show that under the most general conditions the detector never recovers its quantum coherence and the entanglement between the detector and the field remains large at late times . to the extent this model can be used as an analog to the system of a black hole interacting with a quantum field </S>",
    "<S> , our result seems to suggest in the prevalent non - markovian regime , assuming unitarity for the combined system , that black hole information is not lost but transferred to the quantum field degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> our combined system will evolve into a highly entangled state between a remnant of large area ( in bekenstein s black hole atom analog ) without any information of its initial state , and the quantum field , now imbued with complex information content not - so - easily retrievable by a local observer . </S>"
