    "we quantify the visibility of the 1/2 flux superfluid diffraction pattern above the broad , thermal background by fitting one - dimensional line cuts of the column density in both the x- and y - lattice directions . to design a peak visibility fitter for the hh superfluid",
    ", one needs to account for multiple degrees of freedom associated with the new peaks that emerge , in addition to the trivial superfluid peaks .",
    "in addition , the uncontrolled phase of the micromotion leads to changes in the diffraction pattern , as seen in the paper . this is because the relative optical path length between the cubic lattice and the running wave raman lattice at the position of the atoms is unstabilized .",
    "when designing a fitter , we must build in the flexibility in handling shot - to - shot changes in the peak locations on the ccd camera .      the fitter works by finding the center of mass of the image and taking the average of several rows of pixels in each direction around this center value .",
    "the total visibility is determined by least - squares fitting both the x and y line cuts to the sum of six gaussians  one broad thermal background and five sharp diffraction peaks .",
    "the visibility of a given peak is defined as the amplitude of the coherent peak divided by the coherent amplitude plus the twice thermal background at the peak center .",
    "this is in analogy with michelson s definition of optical fringe contrast .",
    "we define the final visibility as the average of visibility of the peaks in both the x- and y - directions .",
    "reliable fitting in such a high dimensional parameter space is robust when the fitting routine starts with accurate initial guesses . to generate accurate initial conditions , the image is first low pass filtered to remove spatial frequencies corresponding to the diffraction peaks and higher , and then fitted to a single gaussian function .",
    "the coefficients resulting from this fit become the initial conditions of the thermal fraction in the final fit .",
    "next , the guess for the thermal component is subtracted from the raw lineout and all remaining local maxima are identified with a peak finding algorithm .",
    "the peaks are sorted by amplitude , and the highest five locations are chosen to represent the initial position and amplitude in the initial conditions for the superfluid diffraction peaks . with these input conditions ,",
    "nonlinear least - squares fitting of the six gaussian peaks gave reproducible fits with small residuals .",
    "an example of a typical fit is shown in figure 1 .      to quantify the population imbalance in the two minima of the hh spectrum",
    ", we developed a band mapping technique , in which laser beams are not switched off instantly but instead ramped down to zero smoothly before time - of - flight absorption imaging .",
    "the requirements for band mapping in the @xmath40 hh lattice are different from the standard bandmapping technique in two ways .",
    "first , the two hofstadter sub - bands are connected at dirac points and the total band gap is therefore zero , forbidding a globally adiabatic band mapping procedure . since the atoms are condensed , they are sufficiently localized to quasimomentum states that are far away from the dirac points and are locally gapped .",
    "second , there is a strong potential gradient present , leading to bloch oscillations in the lab frame . for low lattice depths , the bloch oscillations would cause landau - zener transitions at the zone edge .",
    "this effect is minimized by ramping down the lattice relatively quickly , in about one bloch oscillation time . in the case of topologically trivial superfluids ,",
    "all the lattices are linearly ramped down in @xmath41 ms . in the case of hh superfluids ,",
    "raman beams are linearly ramped down in @xmath42 ms first to avoid excitations associated with the raman drive , and then the lattices are linearly ramped down in @xmath41 ms .",

    "the images in figure 2 represent a selection of shots immediately after the @xmath2035 ms ramp out of the mott insulator state into the 1/2 flux superfluid .",

    "although our lifetime seems to be limited largely by technical noise , we wish to discuss the limit given by the time dependent nature of the single - particle wave function representing the ground state of the floquet hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "_ study the stability of a condensate in a tilted one - dimensional lattice with resonant amplitude modulation using a high frequency perturbation analysis .",
    "the ground state of bosons in the corresponding floquet hamiltonian is a superfluid in a geometry with a lattice in one direction and free particle motion in the other two .",
    "the description of this system is simple yet nontrivial due to the metastability of the wannier - stark ladder and the time - modulated many - particle floquet hamiltonian . as pointed out in @xcite , one consequence of these two facts",
    "is that elastic collisions between atoms will deplete the condensate by using one or two quanta of the micromotion ( equal to the offset energy @xmath17 between neighboring sites ) to create excitations .",
    "this will cause decoherence and relaxation to higher temperatures .",
    "there are two main processes contributing to this instability of the condensate .",
    "wannier - stark states  which are mostly localized in a given well @xmath44  have small components in lower wells @xmath45 , with amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "this small component , which has energy @xmath17 higher than the wannier - stark state localized in the well @xmath45 , can collide with atoms in the lower lattice site , thus creating two excitations with energy @xmath47 in the transverse direction ( the creation of two exitations is necessary for conservation of transverse momentum ) .",
    "the second mechanism involves the counter - rotating term of the phonon or photon assisted tunneling process .",
    "the co - rotating term enables resonant tunneling to a lower lattice site by stimulated emission of a phonon . in the counter - rotating process , the atoms tunnels to a lower lattice site , but absorbs a lattice phonon .",
    "therefore , it has now an excess energy of @xmath48 which can create two transverse excitations where each of them has energy @xmath17 .",
    "these two - body elastic collisions convert modulation or tilt energy into motion along the transverse directions .",
    "the characteristic relaxation times of the two processes are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 @xmath52 we can associate @xmath49 with a process that occurs even in the absence of modulation  the rate is proportional to the tunnel coupling squared between neighboring sites , whereas the rate of the @xmath50 process is proportional to the square of the phonon induced tunneling rate .",
    "both decay processes are rather general and should apply to both tilted lattices and lattices modulated by superlattices .    as a test of these predictions , we implemented this hamiltonian experimentally using the same experimental procedure described in the main text for resonant amplitude modulation .",
    "we measured the coherence and lower band population lifetimes as shown in figure 3 .",
    "approximate values in our experiment were @xmath53 , with @xmath54 as the chemical potential , @xmath55 the s - wave scattering length , @xmath56 laser - assisted tunnelling rate , @xmath35 the bare tunnelling rate , and @xmath17 the energy tilt per lattice site .",
    "@xmath57 is the size of the wannier statein the x - direction @xmath58 .",
    "these give us the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which are longer than our observed lifetime.uncertainty is driven by uncertainty in our density measurements due to redistribution during lattice ramp - up .",
    "however , during the long coherence lifetime , significant population loss was observed ( due to inelatic two- or three - body collisions , or transfer to higher bands ) , and detailed further study is needed to identify the contributions of different processes to the decay rate .        the mechanism proposed by choudhury _",
    "_ appears to give a reasonable upper limit for collisional decay in 1d lattices .",
    "we expect the same mechanism to explain at least part of the decoherence observed for both amplitude modulation in a two - dimensional lattice and the hh hamiltonian . for a quantitative comparison , we modify the calculation in @xcite to reflect that a 2d lattice has only one orthogonal direction of free motion . for resonant modulation , in the floquet basis , the hamiltonian is @xmath61 with @xmath62 , v as the system volume , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 as the annihiliation and creation operators for states with quasimomentum @xmath65 .",
    "the interaction parameter is given by @xmath66 where @xmath58 and @xmath67 are the wannier functions in the tilted ( x ) and untilted ( y ) lattice directions , @xmath68 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath69 is the size of the wannier state . the instantaneous single particle dispersion @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the bare tunnelling rates in the x and y directions , and @xmath56 is the effective tunnelling in the tilt direction . following a similar argument , we find that the scattering rate is given by @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 with the effective dispersion : @xmath77 + 2j_y[1-\\cos(k_y)]+\\sqrt{\\frac{gn}{m } ( \\hbar k_z)^2+\\left(\\frac{(\\hbar k_z)^2}{2 m}\\right)^2}.\\ ] ] note that ref .",
    "@xcite uses a hartree - fock excitation energy with free particle dispersion .",
    "the high mean field energy in the one dimensional tubes created by a two dimensional lattice , @xmath54 , is similar in energy scale to the tilt frequency , and we thus use the full bogoliubov spectrum for the energy of quasi - particles .      for our system ,",
    "representative numbers are @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , resulting in @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is much smaller than the decay rates measured in the experiment .",
    "by monitoring the loss of atoms we can show that certain processes are negligible for the loss rate of the superfluid state .",
    "figure 4 shows the lifetime of the population in the lowest band of our lattice  or equivalently the total atom number lifetime , since the strong tilt will quickly remove population promoted to higher bands due to landau - zener tunneling to the continuum .",
    "the lifetime for atom loss from the lower band is about an order - of - magnitude longer than the coherence lifetime and shows a slight decrease with increasing lattice depth . for comparison , a bec in an untilted lattice exhibits coherence times exceeding one second in deep lattices .    we conclude that the population loss seen in figure 4 is dominated by some process beyond heating in standard lattices ( spinflip collisions , magnetic field noise , lattice intensity noise , and beam pointing noise ) .",
    "however , the dominant decay process for the bec in the hh lattice are excitations within the lowest band",
    ".    a 3d lattice should be helpful for reducing collisional heating .",
    "qualitatively , in a fermi s golden rule picture of heating , the decay rate depends on the dispersion relation of the transverse modes @xcite .",
    "thus , if a 3d lattice has a bandgap at the energies @xmath17 and @xmath47 , at which quasiparticles can be created , we would expect to see a `` gapping out '' of collisional heating and a corresponding increase in the lifetime upper limit . since we do not see a qualitative change in lifetime when changing the bandgap",
    ", we conclude that , similarly to a 2d lattice , technical fluctuations are the likely limit of the lifetime .    2ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4576 [ ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase 10.1103/physreva.91.033601 [ * * ( ) ,  10.1103/physreva.91.033601 ]"

    "<S> , we developed a band mapping technique that adiabatically connects the hh ground states to momentum states ( see supplement ) . </S>",
    "<S> band mapping reduces the complicated diffraction patterns of fig . 1 to two peaks , one for each degenerate ground state . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b shows that the minima are most frequently populated with equal proportion , demonstrating the degeneracy of the minima and the robustness of the loading procedure to technical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> however , mean - field calculations predict that a superposition state , which would create spatial density modulation , is energetically unfavorable due to repulsive interactions @xcite . therefore , the simultaneous occupation of both minima most likely indicates the presence of domains , composed of atoms in only one of the dispersion minima .    to rule out non - adiabatic transitions to higher bands as an alternative explanation of the two peaks in band mapping </S>",
    "<S> , we tested the technique on a topologically trivial floquet superfluid ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this system consists of a cubic lattice with a tilted potential where tunneling in the tilted axis is restored by amplitude modulation ( am ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its micromotion , which is similar to that of the hh system , and its trivial band structure allows identification of non - adiabatic excitations attributed to the micromotion . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting momentum distributions for both the am and the hh systems are shown in figure 2b . </S>",
    "<S> non - adiabatic band excitations would appear as additional peaks in the tilted direction , which are not observed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we interpret the band mapping procedure in the hh system as an adiabatic process .     15 ms and 71 @xmath16 8 ms , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the data were taken after a 10 ms hold time after switching on the final hamiltonian using the non - adiabatic procedure ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainty is given by the statistical error of the mean of five repetitions of the experiment , added in quadrature to uncertainty in the peak visibility fitting . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the above results confirm many aspects of the weakly interacting superfluid ground state of the hh hamiltonian . however , there are many open questions about topological physics in the presence of strong interactions , often involving small energy differences . to study this regime , long coherence lifetimes are necessary .    in order to evaluate our coherence lifetime and disentangle different sources of decoherence and heating </S>",
    "<S> , we extensively used the am superfluid as a benchmark . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the hh superfluid had a vastly shorter lifetime than the am superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent improvements in the stability of magnetic fields , beam pointing , raman phase , and gradient alignment to the lattice direction improved the hh lifetime until both systems had a comparable lifetime in the ground state , given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . the lifetimes for the number of trapped atoms </S>",
    "<S> is much longer than the coherence lifetime in either case , with no discernible loss of atom number up to 500 ms . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the conclusion that two - body dipolar interactions and three - body recombination , which would lead to particle loss from the trap , are not limiting the lifetime of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies to excitations to higher lying bands which , due to the tilt , are strongly coupled to the continuum via landau - zener tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the decay in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 is dominated by transitions within the lowest band , which can be caused by technical noise or by elastic collisions that transfer energy from the micromotion into heat . </S>",
    "<S> while our heating seems to be largely technical , it is useful to briefly discuss these collisions as an ultimate limit on the lifetime .    </S>",
    "<S> for the tilted lattice , one decay path is via overlap of neighboring wannier - stark states with offset energy @xmath17 , which can be transferred to excitations of the lowest bands , or to the free particle motion along the tubes orthogonal to the 2d lattice . </S>",
    "<S> such processes are described by fermi s golden rule for transitions between floquet states @xcite . using this framework </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the scattering rate for the am superfluid to be between @xmath18 , where the uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in our density measurement due to redistribution during lattice ramp - up . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is smaller than the observed decay rate by a factor of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> see supplement for a derivation and experimental parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> in principle , an adiabatic procedure to prepare the ground state of the hh hamiltonian should enable better control and higher fidelity in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> however , we empirically found that a sudden turn - on of the tilt and the raman beams gave the most consistent high contrast images , and was therefore useful in evaluating technical improvements . a slower turn - on could introduce more technical heating , and the entropy created in the sudden turn - on </S>",
    "<S> could be absorbed by other degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> such an entropy reservoir is provided in the 2d lattice schemes by the third dimension  in our case tubes of condensates with @xmath20500 atoms . for extensions to 3d lattices , </S>",
    "<S> we implement an adiabatic state preparation procedure .     to enter the mott insulating phase , after which the hyperfine state is flipped with a 0.29 ms rf sweep as done in the non - adiabatic scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the lattices are then ramped down to their final values while the raman lattice is ramped up in 35 ms . </S>",
    "<S> lifetimes of both methods are given in the top corner of each figure ; the lifetime of the adiabatic approach is measured from the end of the 35 ms ramp . </S>",
    "<S> errors are statistical and given by the exponential fit of the peak visibility . ]    </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic methods usually require a pathway where the ground state is protected by a gap . for single particle states , this may involve matching the size of the unit cell between a topologically nontrivial lattice and a trivial lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we explore the use of many - body gap of the bosonic mott insulator state . since the bose - hubbard model and the hh model with interactions have the same mott insulating ground state for large u ( assuming the high frequency limit @xmath21 ) , one can connect a trivial superfluid in the cubic lattice to the ground state of the hh model via two quantum phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the first transition `` freezes '' out the original superfluid by entering the mott insulator where the phases of the tunneling matrix elements can be changed to a non - zero flux configuration without adding entropy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second transition `` unfreezes '' the mott state into the hh superfluid . technically , this approach can not be fully adiabatic due to the exact degeneracy of the ground states in the hh spectrum ; a kibble - zurek model implies that this will lead to the spontaneous formation of domains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this will not create entropy beyond the randomization of domains .    </S>",
    "<S> we implement this scheme to load the ground state of the hh hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have found the adiabatic turn - on to be less robust against technical noise , leading to a higher shot - to - shot variability ; however , the best images have identical visibility and a marginally better lifetime than that of the non - adiabatic state preparation method ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) .        we can now use the lattice in the third dimension , required for the adiabatic loading protocol , to add stronger interactions to the physics of gauge fields . to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we keep the lattice depths and tunneling strengths along the x- and y - directions constant , but vary the depth of the z - lattice , thereby adjusting the hubbard interaction parameter u from nearly zero to @xmath20450 hz . with an estimated filling factor of @xmath205 , we can access interaction energies in excess of @xmath22 , which is close to the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition in high magnetic fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we realize hh superfluids with lattice depths from 0 to 20 @xmath23 and observe at least weak superfluid diffraction peaks ( see supplement ) . coherence lifetimes for z - lattice depths up to 11 @xmath23 are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the average visibility of the diffraction pattern is reduced at high z - lattices , but the lifetimes are reduced only by a factor of @xmath24 from the lifetime of the weakly interacting superfluid at 0 @xmath23 . however , we observe much larger shot - to - shot variation : some shots will have clearly visible diffraction peaks , while other attempts show no coherence at all . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the variation to technical fluctuations , which seem to have an enhanced effect at higher 3d lattices .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed bose - einstein condensation in a strong synthetic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we have directly observed how the gauge potential breaks the symmetry of the original lattice . to reach the regime of strong interactions , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the hh model can be implemented with reasonably long coherence times in the presence of both strong gauge fields and strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this work lays the groundwork for further investigations of topologically nontrivial and/or highly frustrated states . </S>",
    "<S> straightforward modifications of our setup such as the introduction of complex tunneling in the z - direction or pseudospins realize weyl points @xcite , the quantum spin hall hamiltonian , and ultracold atom topological insulators @xcite . recent technological advances in controlling and detecting ultracold atoms combined with this work offer a promising path toward realization of bosonic laughlin states in optical lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to realize strong gauge fields with strong interactions highlights the capability of ultracold atom systems to realize exotic states of matter with no known analogues in nature . </S>"
