    "solar photospheric magnetic fields and their associated dynamics have been extensively studied . however",
    "an understanding of their vertical variation from the photosphere though the chromosphere to the corona needs better comprehension . direct measurement and diagnosis of magnetic and flow fields in higher layers , especially in the near force - free chromosphere can play an important role in fully understanding their three - dimensional ( 3d ) structures . nevertheless , such efforts were relatively rare due to the paucity of chromospheric spectral lines with suitable zeeman - split sensitivity @xcite and the complicated dynamics and topology of the magnetized plasma in this particular layer . taking advantage of modern observational techniques and recognizing the critical need to explore chromospheric magnetic fields , increasing attention has recently been paid to the spectro - polarimetry of the chromosphere , which reveal the height - dependent variation of different types of magnetic features .",
    "those analyses were made using magnetically sensitive spectral lines formed in the chromospheric levels , such as  849.8 and 854.2  nm ,  1083.0  nm and d@xmath7 line ,  d@xmath8 589.6  nm , h@xmath9  and h@xmath10  lines .",
    "in particular , the  b@xmath0 517.27  nm line is favorable for spectro - polarimetry in the low chromosphere because its core forms in a narrow region near or right above the temperature minimum region ( tmr ) with a relatively large land g@xmath11 factor of 1.75 . theoretical calculation @xcite and observational analysis have been carried out on  b@xmath0 stokes polarization spectra , which corroborate that it is well suited for probing the magnetic and flow fields in the low chromosphere .",
    "doppler shifts of stokes @xmath1 and @xmath12 signals can be used to investigate mass flows in and around magnetic elements .",
    "in contrast to the stokes @xmath1 that represents the total intensity of light , the stokes @xmath13 ( the linearly polarized component ) and @xmath4 ( the circularly polarized component ) have contribution only from the magnetized plasma .",
    "thus doppler shifts of the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath12 profiles reflect average line - of - sight ( los ) velocities of plasmas in the whole resolution element and those within magnetic regions , respectively .",
    "asymmetries of stokes profiles are a powerful diagnostics of the height and spatial properties of magnetic and flow fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "under a restrictive milne - eddington atmosphere where magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) conditions ( e.g. , plasma velocity , magnetic field vector , and temperature ) are constant with depth and the source function varies linearly with optical depth @xcite , the zeeman - split stokes @xmath14 profiles are symmetric , while @xmath4 is antisymmetric about the line center .",
    "most of the observed stokes spectra , however , deviate from the ideal forms and exhibit notable difference between the blue and red wings in amplitude and/or area .",
    "therefore the stokes asymmetry is able to reveal the inhomogeneous nature of the solar atmosphere .",
    "direct observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and modeling of synthetic stokes profiles have found possible physical conditions for producing asymmetric stokes spectra , such as gradients of flow velocity and/or magnetic field vector along the los direction and nonuniform atmosphere that contains two or more distinct magnetic and/or flow components in one resolution element .",
    "a more comprehensive study by @xcite based on the analytical solution for the generalized transfer equation explicitly demonstrates that the velocity gradients are the necessary and sufficient condition for stokes profile asymmetries .",
    "the addition of other effects or gradients of other mhd parameters ( e.g. , magnetic field and temperature ) could enhance the asymmetries and give different characteristics of asymmetries .",
    "for example , strong stokes @xmath1 and @xmath4 asymmetries are usually found around magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere , which is attributed to the presence of the `` magnetic canopy '' .",
    "strong gradients in both magnetic and flow fields are naturally generated because the `` magnetic canopy '' spatially separates the field - free convective downdrafts from the more static flux tube that fans out above the photosphere .",
    "the aforementioned analyses of stokes profiles predominantly use photospheric spectral lines .",
    "in retrospect , only few such attempts using chromospheric stokes spectra have been reported . as examples , inferred fast down flows concentrated in narrow lanes surrounding the flux tube below the `` magnetic canopy '' by using stokes @xmath4 asymmetries of  b@xmath0 line in additional to photospheric lines .",
    "@xcite compared the stokes @xmath4 asymmetries between photospheric  lines and chromospheric  lines and found differences in their spatial distribution within a simple sunspot .",
    "additional investigation of chromospheric stokes spectra in conjunction with photospheric measurements would improve our understanding of 3d magnetic topology and plasma flows .    in this paper",
    ", we study doppler shifts and asymmetries of stokes profiles of three spectral lines simultaneously observed in an active region close to the disk center .",
    "the three spectral lines ,  630.25  nm ( g@xmath15 ) ,  630.15  nm ( g@xmath16 ) , and  b@xmath0 , are formed at partially overlapping atmospheric layers spanning from the photosphere to the low chromosphere . even though both are regarded as photospheric lines , the  630.15  nm line often forms above the 630.25  nm line ( e.g. ,",
    "combining data from multiple atmospheric heights using these spectral lines thus enables us to shed new light on the properties of magnetic and flow structures associated with different magnetic features .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  ",
    "[ sec : observation ] and  [ sec : reduction ] , we introduce the observations and present the procedure for data reduction . in   [ sec : results ] the results of comparison of profile shifts and asymmetries among the three spectral lines are described and discussed .",
    "we summarize our major findings and present some prospects for future studies in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we obtained the spectropolarimetric data sets using the 76  cm dunn solar telescope and its associated adaptive optics system @xcite , along with the high altitude observatory / national solar observatory advanced stokes polarimeter ( hao / nso asp , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations were obtained on 2001 october 17 under excellent seeing conditions .",
    "the asp is a slit - grating spectropolarimeter .",
    "the 1.6@xmath17  @xmath18  0.6  slit was oriented in the solar north - south direction and scanned in the east - west direction .",
    "each whole scan took 280 steps with a step size of 0.6 , which results in a field of view ( fov ) of 1.6@xmath17  @xmath18  2.8@xmath17 that covers the near disk center ( n14@xmath19 , w6@xmath19 , @xmath20cos@xmath21 ) active region noaa 9661 as shown in figure  [ fig : ar ] .",
    "it contains a @xmath6 sunspot at left , an @xmath9 sunspot at right , as well as several pores and plages lying in between .",
    "the obtained spatial sampling is about 0.42@xmath22  pixel@xmath23  in the north - south direction and 0.6@xmath22  pixel@xmath23  in the east - west direction .",
    "full stokes @xmath24 spectra were taken simultaneously in two spectral bands centered at 630.2  nm and 517.27  nm by two asp cameras .",
    "the dispersions for the two spectral bands are 1.27 and 1.02  pm  pixel@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "each whole scan took about 25  minutes .",
    "a total of five whole scans were continuously taken within 2.5  hours , during which no significant evolution of the magnetic structures was found .",
    "other information about the observation run can be found in @xcite .",
    "we applied the standard asp calibration procedures @xcite to the data sets .",
    "the calibrated stokes @xmath25 spectra were normalized to the quiet sun continuum intensity @xmath26 that was obtained by fitting the kitt peak fts atlas to the observed stokes @xmath1 profiles .",
    "the data sets from the five whole scans were then integrated to increase the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the standard deviation @xmath27 in near continuum wavelength range for each integrated stokes @xmath25 profile to represent the profile noise level .",
    "only profiles with signal amplitude greater than 7@xmath27 ( an empirical s / n threshold that performs well in our data analysis ) were used for this study .",
    "we extracted the parameters for analyzing the shift and asymmetry of stokes profiles using the following procedures .",
    "\\(1 ) _ stokes @xmath1 los velocities @xmath2_. we employed a fourier phase method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to determine the line core wavelength .",
    "we then converted the wavelength shifts to velocities ( @xmath2 ) by using the doppler formula . as a frame of reference",
    ", we use the average velocity of a small area in the nearly motionless umbra .",
    "\\(2 ) _ stokes @xmath4 los velocities @xmath5_. normalized stokes @xmath4 profiles were smoothed to remove local noise .",
    "they were then divided into two cases : normal profiles that have two opposite lobes and one zero - crossing ( zc ) point in between , and abnormal profiles that have no or multiple zcs within a wavelength range corresponding to @xmath28  km@xmath29s@xmath23  from stokes @xmath1 line center . using this method",
    ", there is a small chance that we may improperly classify normal profiles into an abnormal class .",
    "for example , strong magneto - optical effects ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : abvsample]@xmath30 and text in   [ abnormal ] ) produce stokes @xmath4 profiles with 3 zcs , although the profile is essentially normal .",
    "such improperly classified cases only account for a small portion ( @xmath31 0.3% ) in the data and do not affect the analysis . for normal profiles ,",
    "the zc shifts are converted to los velocities ( @xmath5 ) in a same manner as @xmath2 .",
    "the abnormal profiles will be discussed in   [ abnormal ] .",
    "\\(3 ) _ linear polarization ( lp ) los velocities @xmath3_. the combination @xmath32 is a measure of the overall @xmath33 magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath33 profiles were smoothed to remove local noise .",
    "it is difficult to measure the position of the central @xmath34 component as it is usually small and sometimes even vanishes ( see figure  [ fig : avgprof ] ) .",
    "instead we measure the peak positions of the two @xmath27 components and use their mid - point as the position of the @xmath33 profile .",
    "we then converted the @xmath33 profile shifts to los velocities ( @xmath3 ) in a same manner as @xmath2 .",
    "\\(4 ) _ amplitude asymmetry @xmath35 and area asymmetry @xmath36_. the peak amplitudes of the blue ( @xmath37 ) and the red ( @xmath38 ) lobes of normal stokes @xmath4 profiles and those of the two @xmath27 components of @xmath33 profiles are determined .",
    "the areas of blue ( @xmath39 ) and red ( @xmath40 ) lobes are obtained by integrating over the same wavelength range ( 0.02  nm ) on both sides of the zc wavelength for stokes @xmath4 profiles or the mid - point of the two @xmath27 components for @xmath33 profiles .",
    "the integrating range not only covers the majority of the stokes @xmath4 or @xmath33 signal corresponding to stokes @xmath1 doppler core , but also rules out the blends from the neighboring telluric lines .",
    "following , the amplitude asymmetry @xmath35 and area asymmetry @xmath36 are derived using the following formulae : @xmath41    @xmath42     +",
    "figure  [ fig : nzc ] shows the stokes @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath33 images constructed by line core intensity and integrated stokes @xmath4 and @xmath33 signals , respectively",
    ". images of the three spectral lines are arranged following the order of their formation heights ( increasing height from bottom to top ) .",
    "the orange points are the locations of noisy profiles with s / n @xmath31 7 .",
    "the @xmath33 spectra have more noisy profiles than stokes @xmath4 , because the zeeman signals for @xmath33 are essentially lower and near the disk center the transverse magnetic fields are weaker than the longitudinal fields for most of the areas in the low atmosphere .",
    "compared to the photospheric  spectra , the chromospheric  polarimetric ( stokes @xmath4 and @xmath33 ) spectra generally have lower s / n thus more useless profiles .",
    "the reasons are mainly due to the larger line width and the lower magnetic field strengths in the chromosphere . in the following ,",
    "we first address the spatial distribution of abnormal stokes @xmath4 profiles , which are important for evaluating the complexity of magnetic and flow fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we then present the results of doppler shifts and asymmetric properties of the stokes profiles , where all the noisy and abnormal profiles are excluded from analysis .      in the middle column of figure",
    "[ fig : nzc ] , locations with abnormal stokes @xmath4 profiles are marked using colored points .",
    "they are divided into three kinds according to the number of zc within a range of @xmath28  km@xmath29s@xmath23  from their stokes @xmath1 line centers as shown in figure  [ fig : abvsample ] .",
    "profiles with two zcs ( _ green _ ) are most frequently seen , which have three lobes with the central one opposite to the other two ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abvsample]@xmath43 ) .",
    "they concentrate in the regions of magnetic polarity inversion line ( mpil ) and the outer penumbral boundaries .",
    "they are mainly caused by the presence of mixed polarities associated with different velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereby the two polarities can be present beside each other ( i.e. , within one resolution element ) or along the los over the line formation region . in outer penumbral regions , the number of two zcs decreases with height , which implies that the mixed polarity effect is weaker at higher atmospheric levels .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the orientation of outer penumbral fields changes from horizontal or even downward to more vertical when they extend from the photosphere to the chromosphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , in the central part of the mpil of the @xmath6 spot there are more locations with two zcs in the  image .",
    "we speculate that this may point to a stronger mixed polarity effect around the highly non - potential mpil in the chromosphere .",
    "the central part of the @xmath6 spot s mpil is also populated by locations without zc ( _ red _ ) .",
    "such locations may involve magnetic components carrying high speed flows , which cause the zc to shift far from the line center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abvsample]@xmath44 ) .",
    "since the zc position of stokes @xmath4 is susceptible to the presence of velocity gradients through the line formation region @xcite or distortion of line profiles by noise , it is also possible that the profiles at these locations are highly asymmetric or distorted .",
    "there exists another kind of profile with three zcs ( _ blue _ ) .",
    "they could be caused by residual noise or mixed polarity effect .",
    "other than this , the three zcs profiles within the umbra seen in 630.25  nm stokes @xmath4 image are most likely due to the magneto - optical effect ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : abvsample]@xmath30 ) caused by strong zeeman effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : velo ] , we show dopplergrams ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 ) for each spectral line .",
    "they are constructed using the los velocities derived from the shifts of stokes @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath33 profiles at each spatial point , respectively .",
    "we note the followings : ( 1 ) for the two photospheric lines , the spatial distribution of penumbral evershed flow in @xmath2 dopplergrams is similar to that in @xmath3 but significantly different from @xmath5 dopplergrams .",
    "( 2 ) the variation of evershed flow with height can be seen by the three spectral lines .",
    "interestingly , the evershed flow reverses its sign from the  to  dopplergrams in some places as illustrated by a center - side penumbra ( _ white box _ ) , which is known as the inverse evershed effect observed in the chromosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while in some other places , the sign reversal has not yet happened or is rudimentary .",
    "this provides a qualitative evidence on the formation height of the  b@xmath0 , which is at or just above the tmr .",
    "( 3 ) the  @xmath2 dopplergrams show that small pores and plages lying in between the two sunspots are generally surrounded by red - shifted downflows , some of which do not appear in the  @xmath2 dopplergram as pointed by white arrows on the top three panels of figure  [ fig : velo ] .",
    "in contrast , the  @xmath5 dopplergrams show zc redshifts all over the plage regions .",
    "we suspect that the red - shifted @xmath5 signal may not represent real down flows in flux tubes but could result from the combination of the susceptibleness of zc position to the large stokes @xmath4 asymmetry often observed by photospheric lines in plage regions and the limited spectral resolution due to smoothing .",
    "we quantitatively compare the @xmath2 with @xmath5 and @xmath3 in different magnetic regions for each spectral line by making scatter plots of @xmath2 vs. @xmath5 and @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 shown in the forth and fifth row of figure  [ fig : velo ] , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath33 signal is only strong enough in penumbrae and mpil , velocities from these regions are plot in @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 panels .",
    "each group of data points are fit with a form of @xmath45 or @xmath46 , and their linear correlation coefficients ( c.c . )",
    "are also obtained .",
    "we discuss the scatter plots for different regions as follows .",
    "_ pores_for the two photospheric  lines , @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) is observed with moderate correlation ( c.c.@xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) . for the  line , @xmath51 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) with strong correlation ( c.c.@xmath53 ) is observed .",
    "it is well established that the magnetic filling factor ( mff ) is almost 1 and the magnetic fields are nearly vertical in the pores .",
    "this is even true for pores in heights above the photosphere , which explains that @xmath5 show large similarity with @xmath2 as seen by the  line .",
    "while down to the photosphere near the edge of pores the field lines may be more inclined and the mff may be less than 1 in such an observation with median spatial resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "strong and narrow field - free down flows with speed larger than that within the pores have been found immediately around pores in the photosphere @xcite , which gives rise to @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 .",
    "this might be responsible for the observed @xmath47 in the  lines .    _",
    "penumbrae_the penumbral magnetic fields are known to consist of a more vertical component and a more horizontal component in the photosphere ( interlocking - comb structure , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this region close to the disk center , @xmath5 have more contribution from the more vertical component than from the other component . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath3 have more contribution from the more horizontal component .",
    "figure  [ fig : velo ] shows that @xmath2 has much better spatial and magnitude correlation with @xmath3 than with @xmath5 for the two  lines",
    ". moreover , the slopes of @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 ( k@xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively ) are close to 1 and much larger than those of @xmath2 vs. @xmath5 ( k@xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ) . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath3 is very close to @xmath2 and their magnitude is much larger than @xmath55 .",
    "these results directly support that the penumbral evershed flows are not only magnetized but mainly carried by the horizontal magnetic component as previously found by other authors using different observations and methods . while for the  line , @xmath2 is observed similar to both of @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) with small correlation coefficients ( c.c.@xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ) .",
    "this implies that rising up to the tmr the penumbral magnetic and flow structures are different from those in the photosphere .",
    "the large scatter of the data points resulted from noisier and weaker polarimetric signal of the  line hinders us from drawing solid conclusion .",
    "we thus speculate that the interlocking - comb structure of the penumbral magnetic and flow field might be a shallow phenomenon mainly in the photosphere .",
    "_ mpil_for a compact elongated region around the mpil and within the common penumbra of the @xmath6 spot , apart from noise dominating the  630.25 @xmath2 and @xmath3 signal , the dopplergrams show strong redshift with a mean speed conspicuously larger than that of simultaneously observed evershed flows . @xmath5 and @xmath3 are generally well correlated with @xmath2 .",
    "the linear fittings show that @xmath62 and @xmath54 are close to each other and much smaller than @xmath55",
    ". the large @xmath55 may be artificial signal resulted from large stokes @xmath4 asymmetry and limited spectral resolution as discussed above .",
    "it is also possible that the mixed polarities there contain a component possessing a high speed downflow , as observed earlier by @xcite .",
    "detailed examination of the large redshift requires two - component stokes inversion of individual profiles , which is out of the scope of this study .",
    "asymmetries of both stokes @xmath4 and @xmath33 profiles were calculated .",
    "we present results from stokes @xmath4 only because the noisier and weaker @xmath33 signals produce large uncertainty in determined asymmetries although their spatial distributions are qualitatively similar to those of stokes @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : asymimgs ] shows the spatial distribution and spectral variation of the stokes @xmath4 amplitude asymmetry ( @xmath35 ) and area asymmetry ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we also plot their histograms for different magnetic regions in figure  [ fig : histogram ] in order to quantitatively compare the stokes @xmath4 asymmetries among the three spectral lines .",
    "the typical stokes @xmath63 and @xmath33 profiles in those regions are also plotted in figure  [ fig : avgprof ] .",
    "we again discuss various magnetic features separately as follows .    for plages ,",
    "the red lobes are broader and shallower than the blue lobes for the two photospheric  lines , which makes highly asymmetric stokes @xmath4 profiles thus substantial positive @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath64 generally , as previously found .",
    "it is believed that the `` magnetic canopy '' effect and the small mff in photospheric plages play important roles in producing such large positive asymmetries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a noteworthy finding here is that the chromospheric  stokes @xmath4 profiles are much more symmetric as can be seen that the most probable @xmath35 and @xmath36 are very small positive values",
    ". also observed smaller stokes @xmath4 asymmetry in the  b@xmath0 line compared to a photospheric line in network regions .",
    "it was found that for small or weak magnetic structures , such as plage and network , the degree of stokes asymmetries decreases if mff increases . the dependence of amplitude of stokes @xmath4 asymmetries on some line parameters , such as doppler shift , zeeman shift , line strength and width , has also been heuristically considered within the frame of a simplified magnetic canopy model . there",
    "the asymmetry is expected to be small for a same downdraft velocity if the line is broad and not strongly zeeman split .",
    "our result confirms these trends from observational point of view . to sum up ,",
    "both the broader line width and the larger mff in the formation layer of the  b@xmath0 line are responsible for the observed small asymmetry .",
    "together with the aforementioned finding that some of the conspicuous downflows surrounding the plages disappear in the  @xmath2 dopplergram , we therefore suspect that the `` magnetic canopy '' of plages could be a shallow phenomenon mainly below the tmr , which however needs more solid observational evidence to justify .    for penumbrae ( especially their outer parts ) and pores ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are primarily positive and negative in the photosphere and in the low chromosphere , respectively .",
    "previous studies have shown that penumbrae and pores share some common properties .",
    "they both present an interface with the quiet sun and are surrounded by vortex convective flows with similar patterns ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "this study hence adds to the evidence of another common property , i.e. , stokes @xmath4 asymmetries and their variation with height . unlike photospheric lines that can be easily synthesized under lte conditions , the physical origins of the asymmetries of chromospheric lines formed in non - lte atmosphere are far from fully studied .",
    "here we can only present a speculation for the sign reversal of stokes @xmath4 asymmetries based on a logical analog of chromospheric line asymmetries to the better known photospheric line asymmetries that are mainly caused by velocity gradients . the change in sign of evershed effect for penumbrae may be responsible for some but not all areas , because the stokes @xmath4 asymmetries reverse sign all over the outer penumbral borders while the inverse of evershed flow only occurs in some penumbral sectors .",
    "we speculate that the sign reversal of stokes @xmath4 asymmetries in both outer penumbrae and pores could indicate that the velocity in and around them may change drastically from the photosphere to the low chromosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : velo ] provides clues to some of the changes because some downflows in and around pores do not hold in the  @xmath2 dopplergram instead more upflows can be seen ( e.g. , in the scatter plot of the  line ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite observed pores in different wavelengths and found that velocities in the narrow downflow region around pores tend to decrease with height at first , and then change to upflow in the low chromosphere .",
    "such tendency is also visible in the mhd simulation of pores ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the stokes @xmath4 asymmetries change from positive for the  lines to negative for the  line , if indeed all line asymmetries have a velocity gradient origin , thus provides important clues on the 3d structure of the flow field in and around pores and outer penumbrae .    for umbrae , since they lack of mass flows and have mff of @xmath651 in the low photosphere , both of the most probable @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the  630.25  nm line are close to 0 .",
    "the large zeeman splitting of the line in strong field may also contribute to the observed small asymmetry .",
    "however , the distributions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the other two spectral lines show a clear shift toward negative . besides the noise induced inaccuracy of the determined asymmetry due to low light level in the umbra , it is also possible that as height increases umbrae become less uniform and static compared with their structure in the low photosphere .    for the compact region with strong redshifts around the mpil of the @xmath6 spot ,",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 have prominent values that increase with height .",
    "it seems from figure  [ fig : avgprof ] that the red wings of the stokes @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath33 profiles of the two photospheric lines obviously have further redward extension .",
    "meanwhile , the blue damping wings of the  517.27  nm line are surprisingly enhanced , which remains a puzzling issue .",
    "we conjecture that the observed large asymmetries could be due to the combination of the following two effects : the mixed polarities or flows , and the large gradients in velocity , magnetic field vector , or temperature near the mpil region .",
    "considering all the unusual properties observed in this region , we suggest that the magnetic and flow fields around the mpil of the @xmath6 spot are very complex , which deserve a deeper investigation in the future .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of the doppler shifts and asymmetric properties of the stokes profiles , the uniqueness of which is especially in the combination of magnetic sensitive spectral lines that form at different heights spanning from the photosphere to the low chromosphere .",
    "our quantitative analysis benefits from the simultaneous and high resolution spectro - polarimetric observation that include a chromospheric line .",
    "we summarize the major findings and interpretations as follows .    1 .",
    "@xmath2 is very close to @xmath3 but significantly different from @xmath5 in penumbral areas near disc center for the photospheric  lines , which provides direct and strong evidence that the penumbral evershed flows are magnetized and mainly carried by the horizontal magnetic component .",
    "2 .   the rudimentary inverse evershed effect observed by the  b@xmath0 line provides a qualitative evidence on its formation height that is around or just above the tmr .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath3 in penumbrae and @xmath5 in pores generally approach their @xmath2 observed by the chromospheric  line , which is not the case for the photospheric  lines .",
    "we speculate that the interlocking - comb structure of the penumbral magnetic and flow field might be a shallow phenomenon mainly in the photosphere .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 asymmetries exhibit similar behavior in the regions of outer penumbrae and pores .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 evolve from primarily positive values observed by photospheric  lines to primarily negative values observed by the chromospheric  line .",
    "5 .   in plage regions where the `` magnetic canopy '' effect is present ,",
    "stokes @xmath4 profiles are highly asymmetric in the photosphere but more symmetric in the low chromosphere .",
    "moreover , some of the photospheric downflows surrounding the plages disappear in the  dopplergram . these suggest that the plage `` magnetic canopy '' could be a shallow phenomenon mainly below the tmr .",
    "all the @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 dopplergrams reveal strong redshifts in a compact region around the mpil and within the common penumbra of the @xmath6 spot .",
    "large positive stokes @xmath4 asymmetries are also present and even strengthen with height .",
    "these unusual phenomena are manifestations of the complex nature of the 3d topology of the highly non - potential region .",
    "we conclude that analysis of stokes profiles using both the photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines can furnish crucial information on the 3d structure of the magnetic and flow fields .",
    "similar study using other chromospheric lines will be essential to see if the behavior and trend of velocities and asymmetries observed by the  @xmath66 line is general for all the chromospheric lines .",
    "the speculations made in this study , such as the velocity gradient origin of the chromospheric line asymmetries and the thinness of the interlocking - comb structure of penumbral magnetic and flow fields , need further investigation to justify . to advance firmly towards a sound and reliable measurement of magnetic fields in the chromosphere , not only more polarimetric observations using chromospheric lines",
    "are needed , but also a better understanding of their complicated profile formation conditions is critical .",

    "<S> we analyzed the full stokes spectra using simultaneous measurements of the photospheric (  630.15 and 630.25  nm ) and chromospheric (  b@xmath0 517.27  nm ) lines . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained with the hao / nso advanced stokes polarimeter , about a near disc center sunspot region , noaa ar 9661 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the characteristics of stokes profiles in terms of doppler shifts and asymmetries among the three spectral lines , which helps us to better understand the chromospheric lines and the magnetic and flow fields in different magnetic regions . </S>",
    "<S> the main results are : ( 1 ) for penumbral area observed by the photospheric  lines , doppler velocities derived from stokes @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are very close to those derived from linear polarization profiles ( @xmath3 ) but significantly different from those derived from stokes @xmath4 profiles ( @xmath5 ) , which provides direct and strong evidence that the penumbral evershed flows are magnetized and mainly carried by the horizontal magnetic component . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the rudimentary inverse evershed effect observed by the  b@xmath0 line provides a qualitative evidence on its formation height that is around or just above the temperature minimum region . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) @xmath5 and @xmath3 in penumbrae and @xmath5 in pores generally approach their @xmath2 observed by the chromospheric  line , which is not the case for the photospheric  lines . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) outer penumbrae and pores show similar behavior of the stokes @xmath4 asymmetries that tend to change from positive values in the photosphere (  lines ) to negative values in the low chromosphere (  line ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) the stokes @xmath4 profiles in plage regions are highly asymmetric in the photosphere and more symmetric in the low chromosphere . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) strong red shifts and large asymmetries are found around the magnetic polarity inversion line within the common penumbra of the @xmath6 spot . </S>",
    "<S> we offer explanations or speculations to the observed discrepancies between the photospheric and chromospheric lines in terms of the three - dimensional structure of the magnetic and velocity fields . </S>",
    "<S> this study thus emphasizes the importance of spectro - polarimetry using chromospheric lines . </S>"
