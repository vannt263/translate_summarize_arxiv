    "the modern mass surveys of galaxy redshifts like 2df ( colless  @xcite ) , hipass ( zwaan  @xcite ) , 6df ( jones  @xcite ) , alfalfa ( giovanelli  @xcite ) and sdss ( abazajian  @xcite ) give us extensive opportunities to refine and improve our knowledge about the structure of our universe .",
    "in the series of papers ( karachentsev & makarov @xcite ; makarov & karachentsev @xcite ) we have studied the distribution and properties of galaxy groups on scale of the local supercluster . during this work we found surprisingly high fraction of groups consisting of dwarf galaxies . some very interesting objects happen to be among these groups .",
    "it is famous metal deficient galaxy i  zw  18 . the pair of extremely metal - poor blue compact dwarf hs  0822 + 3542 and low surface brightness object sao  0822 + 3545 were studied by chengalur  ( @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that gas rich galaxies with very low metallicity ( ekta  @xcite ) appear quite often among the systems from our sample . on the other hand ,",
    "tully  ( @xcite ) pointed out the existence in the local volume of associations of galaxies which exclusively consist of dwarfs . that associations were identified based on 3d map of nearby galaxies with distances of high precision .",
    "these structures can contain big amount of dark matter and the mass - to - light ratios are in the range 1001000",
    "m / l in solar units .",
    "our systems are related to tully s association of dwarfs and they also could have very high mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we have started spectroscopic survey of galaxies from our sample on russian 6-meter telescope of sao ras . in this work",
    "we describe the selection and analyse the properties of groups of dwarf galaxies in the local supercluster .",
    "we use the hyperleda ( paturel  @xcite ) and the ned databases as main sources of data on radial velocities , apparent magnitudes , morphological types and other parameters of galaxies .",
    "a blind use of database is fraught with false and erroneous data .",
    "both databases contain a significant amount of ` spam ' : objects with erroneous radial velocities that come from the mass sky surveys such as 2df etc .",
    "quite common case is a confusion of coordinates and velocities of galaxies located close to each other on the sky .",
    "apparent magnitudes and radial velocities from the sdss survey often correspond to individual knots and associations in bright galaxies .",
    "we have taken into account and corrected different kind of contamination of the databases . as a matter of fact",
    "it is most hard and time - consuming part of our work .",
    "additionally , we made a number of optical identifications of @xmath1 sources from the hipass survey , specifying their coordinates and determining the apparent magnitudes and morphological types of galaxies ( karachentsev  @xcite ) .",
    "many dwarf galaxies , especially of low surface brightness , were examined by us on the dss digital images to determine their magnitudes and morphological types .",
    "we use @xmath2-band photometry as indicator of stellar mass of a galaxy because it is weakly affected by a dust and young blue star complexes in the galaxy .",
    "most of near - infrared photometry comes from the all - sky 2mass survey ( jarrett  @xcite ) . in case of lack of @xmath2-band photometry",
    "we transferred the optical ( @xmath3 ) and near infrared ( @xmath4 ) magnitudes into the @xmath2-magnitudes as it described in series of our papers ( karachentsev & makarov @xcite ; makarov & karachentsev @xcite ) .",
    "note that because of short exposure the 2mass survey turned out to be insensitive to the galaxies with low surface brightness and blue colour .",
    "thus we have the direct near - infrared measurements for about 65% of galaxies in our sample and for 35% the @xmath2 magnitude was estimated from optic .",
    "we collected 10914 galaxies with radial velocities in the local group rest frame of @xmath5 km s@xmath0 , located at the galactic latitudes @xmath6 .",
    "the sample of such a depth contains the entire the local supercluster with its distant outskirts , surrounding voids and ridges of the neighbouring clusters .",
    "our algorithm ( karachentsev @xcite ; makarov & karachentsev @xcite ) for group selection is based on natural requirement that total energy of physical pair of galaxies has to be negative .",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total mass of the pair , and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant .",
    "however , observations give us only radial velocities and the sky - plane projected distance between the galaxies .",
    "two galaxies with a very small difference in radial velocities but a large separation in the sky can meet the condition ( [ eq : criterion1 ] ) without being mutually bound .",
    "hence the condition of negative total energy of the pair , expressed in terms of the observables must be added by another restriction on the maximal distance between the components at their fixed mass @xmath8 .",
    "the condition when the pair components remain within the sphere of ` zero - velocity ' ( sandage @xcite ) takes the form of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble constant .",
    "we determined the masses of galaxies from their integral luminosity in the infrared @xmath12-band , supposing that they have the same mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath13 where @xmath14 is taken equal to 6 . in the fact , the value of @xmath15 is only more or less arbitrary parameter of the algorithm . to bound it",
    "we ` trained ' the clusterization algorithm ( [ eq : criterion1][eq : ml ] ) on detailed three - dimensional distribution of galaxies in the local volume ( karachentsev  @xcite ) , where the membership of galaxies in the groups is known from good quality photometric distances .",
    "the choice of @xmath15 is the compromise between a loss of the real members and an impurity of groups by false members . for the @xmath16",
    "we lose significant number of real members while @xmath17 leads to appearance in the groups suspicious members .",
    "moreover , for @xmath18 galaxies are combined into extended non - virialized aggregates . at the given value of @xmath15",
    "the dwarf companions in the well - known nearby groups are usually located inside the zero velocity surface around the major galaxies of these groups .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig : ml_lum ]",
    "in the last decade the modern mass redshift survey significantly increase the number of galaxies with known velocity in the local supercluster .",
    "we developed the algorithm of group selection which is base on on natural requirement that total energy of bounded pair of galaxies has to be negative ( karachentsev & makarov @xcite ; makarov & karachentsev @xcite ) .",
    "application of our method to new data has allowed us to find interesting kind of groups which consist of only dwarf galaxies .",
    "the number of such groups is surprisingly high .",
    "they amount at least 3% of the all groups in the local supercluster .",
    "most of the galaxies in our sample are blue and show sign of ongoing star formation .",
    "the galaxies of very low metallicity like i  zw  18 or hs  0822 + 3542 appear quite often among of them ( chengalur  @xcite ; ekta  @xcite ) .",
    "the groups of dwarfs are characterized by size of 32 kpc and velocity dispersion of 18 km s@xmath0 .",
    "these values are significantly smaller then sizes and inner motion in ordinary groups in the local supercluster ( 204 kpc and 74 km s@xmath0 , respectively ) .",
    "the groups of dwarfs form continuous sequence with association of dwarfs which were found by tully  ( @xcite ) using precise distance determination .",
    "the groups have about the same luminosity and velocity dispersion as association but associations are significantly wider .",
    "the median value of mass - to - light radio of groups of dwarfs is 83 @xmath19 .",
    "it indicates that such kind of groups contains significant amount of dark matter .",
