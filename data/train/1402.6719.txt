    "the australia telescope national facility pulsar catalog @xcite lists over 2300 radio pulsars .",
    "several radio studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have measured the polarization for many of these pulsars .",
    "radio pulsars typically show moderate - to - strong linear polarization ( @xmath6 ) , being stronger for those of higher spin - down energy - loss rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  8) .",
    "the linear polarization sometimes exhibits a characteristic swing or sweep of the position angle in an s - like shape near the pulse center , which is routinely interpreted in terms of the rotating vector model ( rvm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this model",
    "the point of emission is assumed to be in the polar cap region of the pulsar where a dipolar magnetic - field line points with a small angle ( beamwidth ) towards the observer .",
    "the two free parameters of this simple model are the angle between the axes of rotation and the orientation of the magnetic dipole , and the view angle between the line of sight and the rotation axis .",
    "the variation of the radio position angle from some pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) can be described by this model .",
    "the crab pulsar , the compact remnant of sn1054 , and its pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) are amongst the most intensively studied objects in the sky .",
    "the pulsar is one of the youngest and most energetic and its pulsed emission has been detected from 10 mhz @xcite up to 400  gev by veritas @xcite and by magic @xcite .",
    "the pwn is detected at energies up to 100  tev @xcite .",
    "both the pulsar and nebula are predominantly sources of non - thermal radiation ( synchrotron , curvature , and compton processes ) , indicated not only by the broadband spectral continua but also by strong polarization in many wavelength bands @xcite .    in the visible band , spatially - resolved polarimetry of",
    "the nebula , which began over a half century ago @xcite , continues ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "owing to its brightness , phase - resolved optical polarimetry of the pulsar has also been possible @xcite . however , phase - resolved x- and @xmath7-ray polarimetry measurements of the crab pulsar require space - based instruments , which have had limited sensitivity .",
    "oso-8 observations @xcite of the crab established only upper limits to the x - ray ( 2.6-kev and 5.2-kev ) polarization of the pulsed emission .",
    "integral ibis observations @xcite also detect no significant pulsed @xmath7-ray ( 200800-kev ) polarization , although the off - pulse emission appears highly linearly polarized and is possibly associated with structures close to the pulsar rather than with the pulsar itself .",
    "the crab pulsar s light curve exhibits different features at different wavelengths , but it is currently the only pulsar for which the principal features persist over all wavelengths , from radio to @xmath7-ray .",
    "there are two principal components  the main pulse ( mp ) and the interpulse ( ip ) .",
    "this double - peak structure remains more - or - less phase - aligned over all spectral bands @xcite .",
    "one of several additional features in the radio band is the low - frequency component ( lfc , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) , having very low amplitude and occurring @xmath8 fractional pulse phase ( @xmath9 ) before the mp .",
    "this component is most prominent around 1.4  ghz , in contrast with the `` precursor '' component @xcite , which precedes the mp by @xmath10 fractional pulse phase ( @xmath11 ) at 0.327 and 0.610  ghz ( table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the mp and ip appear at roughly the same pulse phase from radio to @xmath7-ray wavelengths , suggesting that their emission originates from a similar location in the magnetosphere at all wavebands .",
    "modeling of @xmath7-ray light curves from the many pulsars observed by the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "@xcite strongly indicates that the high - energy emission originates in the outer magnetosphere , at altitudes comparable to the light - cylinder radius @xcite . outer magnetosphere emission models , such as the outer - gap @xcite , slot - gap @xcite , and current - sheet @xcite had been proposed and studied prior to the _ fermi _ observations , but their emission geometry seems to account for the characteristics and variety of observed @xmath7-ray light curves . in addition , _ fermi _ has discovered a number of @xmath7-ray millisecond pulsars whose radio peaks are nearly aligned with their @xmath7-ray peaks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , like the crab .",
    "modeling both @xmath7-ray and radio light curves of these pulsars with the same outer magnetosphere emission models used to model young pulsars has suggested that their radio emission may originate from very high altitudes @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper we compare the phase - resolved radio polarization observations (  [ s : obs ] ) that we have analyzed (  [ s : res ] ) with such models (  [ s : imp ] ) .",
    "@xcite measured the linear polarization of the crab pulsar s mp and precursor components at two radio frequencies .",
    "the 0.410-ghz measurements found the mp to be @xmath12 linearly polarized at position angle @xmath13 and the precursor to be @xmath14 linearly polarized at position angle @xmath13 .",
    "the 1.664-ghz measurements found the mp to be @xmath1 linearly polarized at position angle @xmath15 and the precursor to be completely absent .",
    "as these measurements had rather large uncertainties and were obtained with a time resolution @xmath16 of the pulse period , they were quite limited for detecting variation of the linear polarization degree or position angle within a feature .",
    "however , @xcite noted a suggestion of rotation of the 1.664-ghz polarization position angle by about @xmath17 through the mp .",
    "more recently , @xcite examined the pulse - profile morphology and polarization properties at three radio frequencies1.424  ghz , 4.885  ghz , and 8.435  ghz  with a time resolution of @xmath18 ( about @xmath19 of the pulse period ) .",
    "the 1.424-ghz measurements found the mp to be @xmath20 linearly polarized at position angle @xmath21 ; the ip , @xmath12 at position angle @xmath21 ; and the lfc , @xmath22 at position angle @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite note that the polarization position angle `` changes across the full period , although not significantly within components '' .",
    "here we first report our observations (  [ s : obs ] ) , using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the netherlands , of the full ( linear and circular ) 1.38-ghz polarization of the crab pulsar , at high time resolution .",
    "we then describe the polarimetry analysis and results (  [ s : res ] and appendix  [ s : stat ] ) for the three pulse components , with a primary objective of determining the sweep of the position angle across each .",
    "next we discuss the implications (  [ s : imp ] ) of our measurements and analysis upon theoretical models for the pulsar emission .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions (  [ s : sum ] ) .",
    "the wsrt observations , on 2011 august 8 , used 14 25-m - diameter dishes combined coherently to form the equivalent of a 94-m dish for pulsar observations . owing to the interferometric nature of the wsrt",
    ", the observations partially resolve out the radio - bright nebula , thus improving sensitivity over typical single - dish observations .",
    "moreover , as the wsrt is an equatorially mounted telescope , there is no need to correct for parallactic angle .    to combine coherently the dishes , correlated data from observation of a bright calibrator source",
    "is used to determine phase delays amongst dishes .",
    "this is accomplished using initially an unpolarized calibrator to determine delays between the two linear polarizations separately , followed by observation of a polarized calibrator to determine any residual delays between the two polarizations .",
    "these procedures accurately calibrate the relative fluxes in the four stokes parameters  hence , the polarization properties  but not the absolute flux .",
    "consequently , we express the stokes measurements ( e.g. , figure  [ f : iquv ] ) in arbitrary units .",
    "the puma - ii @xcite pulsar back - end was used to record nyquist - sampled voltages at 8-bit resolution , across a 160-mhz band centered on 1380  mhz , for psrs b0531 + 21 ( crab ) and b0355 + 54 , for a total of 144 and 18 minutes , respectively .",
    "the data were subsequently coherently de - dispersed and folded using the dspsr @xcite software package .",
    "polarization profiles were formed after correcting for ( frequency - dependent ) interstellar faraday rotation ( rotation measure rm = @xmath24 ) of the position angle , using the psrchive software package @xcite .",
    "the polarization calibration was already carried out when forming the coherent sum of the dishes , nevertheless psr b0355 + 54 was observed to verify that no further polarization calibration was required .",
    "comparison with the profile observed by @xcite showed that the polarization calibration matched exactly .",
    "the crab - pulsar profile was folded using the jodrell bank ephemeris with 8192 bins ( about 4.1 @xmath25s / bin ) across the pulse profile , matching the time resolution of the data after dividing into frequency channels and coherently de - dispersing .",
    "this time resolution was chosen also to match approximately the minimum broadening caused by scattering of the crab pulsed emission by free electrons in the crab nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ f : iquv ] displays our measurement of the four stokes parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29which fully characterize the polarization  folded on the pulse period . unfortunately , we were unable to determine the absolute polarization position angle for the crab pulsar observation . instead , we selected a coordinate system for the stokes parameters such that the mp has @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "inspection of figure  [ f : iquv ] immediately shows that our 1.38-ghz observations detect the flux and polarization of three components  mp , ip , and lfc . like the mp ,",
    "the ip has @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; but the lfc has @xmath34 and @xmath35 : thus , the polarization position angles for the mp and the ip are roughly equal but differ from that of the lfc by about @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "[ e : psi ] ) .",
    "similarly , but less obviously , the circular polarization of the mp and the ip are comparable , but that of the lfc has opposite polarity .",
    "the stokes parameters have the virtues that they are statistically independent , typically exhibit gaussian errors , and are directly superposable  i.e . , each stokes component ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 ) for multiple sources is the sum of the respective stokes component for each source .",
    "these properties follow from the fact that the stokes parameters describe the polarization state in cartesian - like coordinates .",
    "this has the added virtue that there is no coordinate singularity at the origin , as occurs for polar - like coordinates  such as linear - polarization degree @xmath6 and position angle @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , we perform all statistical analyses and model fitting ( appendix  [ s : stat ] ) on ( pre - processed , appendix  [ ss : proc ] ) raw stokes data .",
    "it is , of course , straightforward to transform to more customary parameters ",
    "e.g . , linear - polarization degree @xmath6 ( eq .  [ e : pl ] ) , position angle @xmath36 ( eq .  [ e : psi ] ) , and circular - polarization ( signed ) degree @xmath37 ( eq .  [ e : pc ] ) : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 for the three pulse features ( mp , ip , and lfc ) , we estimate @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 at each datum @xmath44 by substituting the measured @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 into equations  [ e : pl ] , [ e : psi ] , and [ e : pc ]",
    ".    figures  [ f : pol_mp ] and [ f : pol_ip ] display the direct estimates of @xmath45 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 over the mp and ip , respectively . as",
    "the lfc is quite weak relative to the mp and the ip , the plots for the lfc are too noisy to display legibly . even for the stronger features  mp and ip  the rms noise in the directly calculated polarization parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath52 , which serves as an estimator of the statistical error , substantially increases away from the pulse center due to the low signal - to - noise ratio _ per sample _ in the pulse wings . in order to deal effectively with low - signal - to - noise data in the wings of the mp and ip and throughout the ( weaker ) lfc",
    ", we adopt a more rigorous forward - modeling approach to fit the measured stokes data to the modeled @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 :          appendix  [ s : stat ] describes in some detail our approach for fitting polarization models to the stokes data . as figures  [ f : pol_mp ] and [ f : pol_ip ] indicate that neither @xmath60 , @xmath61 , nor @xmath62 varies rapidly across the pulse profile , the approach simply models @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 as taylor - series expansions in the phase - angle offset @xmath63 from the center @xmath64 of the respective pulse feature ( mp , ip , or lfc ) .",
    "table  [ t : fit ] tabulates the best - fit taylor - expansion coefficients for the polarization dependence upon phase - angle offset : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67    .best - fit polarization coefficients for the mp , ip , and lfc , using a single gaussian for each pulse profile and up - to - quadratic variations in polarization functions @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "[ t : fit ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparison of the column `` mp '' in table  [ t : fit1 ] with that in table  [ t : fit2 ] ( or , equivalently , with the column `` 1-gaussian '' in table  [ t : fit6 ] ) finds that inclusion of the three quadratic polarization coefficients  especially @xmath68reduces @xmath69 by 42 ( from 473 to 431 ) . while @xmath70 and @xmath71 within statistical uncertainties",
    ", @xmath72 is statistically significant but small .",
    "the main cause of the poor fit of the 1-gaussian model to the mp data , however , has nothing to do with polarization .",
    "figure  [ f : iquv_mp_2 + 4 ] illustrates that , for the fine time resolution and the high signal - to - noise ratio of the mp data , substructure in the pulse profile is quite evident . using a 6-gaussian ( 2 broad and 4 narrow ) profile for @xmath53",
    "substantially improves the fit . comparing the column `` 6-gaussian '' with `` 1-gaussian '' in table  [ t : fit6 ] finds that inclusion of @xmath73 additional ( gaussian ) parameters reduces @xmath74 by 1221 ( from 1909 to 688 ) .",
    "even so , the fit to the stokes data is not formally acceptable .",
    "it is important to note that the best - fit expectation values and uncertainties for the polarization coefficients ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath68 ; @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ; @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) are rather insensitive to details of the pulse profile .",
    "thus , we compensate for fine substructure in the pulse profile by increasing the estimators for the measurement standard deviations until a statistically acceptable fit is achieved .",
    "that is , we adjust @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 until ( eq .  [",
    "e : chi2 ] ) @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively , are close to unity .",
    "the column `` 1-gaussian ( adj . ) '' in table  [ t : fit6 ] shows the best - fit polarization parameters for a single - gaussian profile , with weightings adjusted as described .",
    "the only noticeable effect of this adjustment upon the best - fit polarization parameters is a small change  typically an increase  in their uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in table  [ t : fit ] (  [ s : res ] ) are the typically more conservative values obtained using the single - gaussian profiles and adjusted weightings .",
