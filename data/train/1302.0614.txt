    "ongoing exponential growth in wire - line data traffic is primarily driven by high - bandwidth digital applications , such as video - on - demand , cloud computing and tele - presence . as a result , it is expected that the currently deployed infrastructure will soon reach its limits , leading to the so - called `` capacity crunch '' @xcite . to counter this trend ,",
    "scientists have been working towards exhausting all available degrees of freedom of fiber - optical transmission , including the bandwidth ( through wdm modulation ) , available power ( subject to power constraints imposed by non - linearities ) , and polarization diversity @xcite .",
    "one possibility to increase throughput is spatial modulation , which would allow multiple transmission streams within the same fiber or fiber bundle .",
    "this can be achieved by designing multi - mode ( mmf ) and/or multi - core fibers ( mcf ) .",
    "an important issue that arises is that typically there is cross - talk between fiber modes , which increases with segment length @xcite and can be attributed to imperfections , as well as to the twist and the bending of the fiber @xcite , and slight variations in the local temperature @xcite .",
    "there have been two trends of work in this direction . in the first",
    ", effort has been made to minimize cross talk between cores to extremely low levels @xcite , thus not having to deal with self - interference .",
    "while appealing from a signal processing point of view , the downside is that this methodology does not scale , in the sense that coupling becomes unavoidable with increasing number of cores in a fiber .",
    "another more pragmatic approach is to design fibers without bothering about the appearance of cross - talk . indeed , bringing cores close to each other can lead to power being spread at the receiver side evenly in the outlook of the channel @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proposed @xcite to use sophisticated transceiver techniques developed in the context of wireless communications between multiple transmitting and receiving antennas ( mimo ) , which can mitigate self - interference , thus providing significant throughput increases .",
    "of course , optical fiber multi - core systems have several differences compared to multi - antenna wireless systems , which need to be addressed .",
    "one important difference is the one - dimensional , near - lossless propagation through the optical fiber . as a result ,",
    "the incoming and outgoing propagating modes of the fiber are related through a so - called scattering matrix @xcite , which is unitary in the limit of lossless propagation . in contrast , since wireless propagation incurs significant radiation loss to the environment , the corresponding channel coefficients may be taken to be i.i.d and gaussian @xcite .",
    "second , due to the existence of non - linearities at high powers , one should specifically have in mind low to moderate total power .",
    "third , in contrast to the wireless setting , where due to physical motion the channel fades significantly over time , the variability of the channel is mostly over different frequencies and fiber segments .",
    "hence , given that a given packet is likely to travel over different segments and frequencies , which can not be known apriori to the transmitter , it is important to define an outage criterion over the realization of the channel matrix in this context . finally , the practical metric for the performance is not the ergodic mutual information , but , rather , the outage capacity at very low outage ( e.g. @xmath0 ) @xcite , due to the fact that feedback from the receiver to the transmitter to request a retransmission in the case of packet loss , is almost always impossible .",
    "it is therefore important to develop a propagation channel model for the fiber - optical mimo channel , which addresses these issues .",
    "several attempts in this direction have been made @xcite , however the unitary aspect of propagation has not been dealt with explicitly until @xcite and then @xcite introduced the unitary aspects of the transmission channel .",
    "in particular , @xcite introduced in a somewhat ad - hoc fashion the so - called jacobi mimo channel , in which the matrix corresponding to the channel is a rectangular submatrix from a haar distributed random matrix from @xmath1 .    in this paper , we derive a channel model for an fiber - optical mimo channel when the coupling between transmitting channels is strong and backscattering is weak .",
    "these two assumptions allow us to provide the general random matrix that characterizes the propagation in such a multimode fiber in the presence of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the resulting model is similar to the one introduced by @xcite , but it also parameterizes loss in the fiber . we show how for increased loss , the channel interpolates between unitary and gaussian .",
    "this channel allows us to analyze the outage capacity of the optical mimo channel . as mentioned above",
    ", this is the relevant information transmission metric for fiber - optical coupled multi - core channels .",
    "we analyze the characterize the problem in a dual way .",
    "first , we obtain closed form expressions for the outage probability for small numbers of channels .",
    "we also obtain analytical expressions , which are valid technically in the limit of large channel numbers , but also work well over smaller channel numbers . it is particularly suited to obtain outage mutual information for very low outages with finite snr .",
    "essentially , it amounts to calculating the rate function of the logarithm of the average moment generating function of the mutual information .",
    "the methodology we use is based on the so - called coulomb gas approach which was developed in the physics literature in the context of random matrix theory @xcite in the 60 s .",
    "it is quite intuitive because it interprets the eigenvalues as point charges on a line repelling each other logarithmically .",
    "the coulomb gas method has seen recently a renewed interest in its use to obtain large deviations results for random matrix problems @xcite and also in communications @xcite .",
    "we will follow the basic steps discussed in more details in @xcite . as a by - product of this analysis",
    "we obtain the ergodic mutual information and its variance for this channel .      in the next section",
    "we will define the system model , and show that that the appropriate channel matrix is a random haar unitary matrix and also define the outage probability , which we would like to analyze . in section [ sec : exactsolution ]",
    "we provide the equations describing the closed - form exact solution for the outage probability , details of which are given in appendix [ app : exactsolution ] . in section [ sec : coulombgasmethodology ] we introduce the mathematical methodology of the coulomb gas and provide our analytic results .",
    "section [ sec : simulations ] deals with numerical validation of our results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "we consider a single - segment @xmath2-channel lossless optical fiber system , with @xmath3 transmitting channels excited and @xmath4 receiving channels coherently excited in the input ( left ) and output ( right ) side of the fiber .",
    "the propagation through the fiber may be analyzed through its @xmath5 scattering matrix given by @xcite @xmath6 this matrix `` connects '' the @xmath2 left ( @xmath7 ) with the @xmath2 right ( @xmath8 ) modes of the fiber .",
    "the @xmath9th column ( for @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 correspond to the reflection coefficients at the left of the @xmath2 modes of the fiber when a unit amplitude signal is inserted from the @xmath9th left input of the fiber .",
    "the same input signal results to transmission through the fiber , with transmission coefficients at the right hand of the fiber given by the @xmath9th column of @xmath12 . in an analogous fashion",
    "the @xmath9th columns of @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to the right - reflection and left - transmission coefficients when a unit amplitude signal is inserted from the @xmath9th right input of the fiber .",
    "the input signal is represented by an @xmath15 dimensional vector , in which the first @xmath2 entries correspond to the amplitudes of the left - incoming signal and the remaining entries to the amplitudes of the right - incoming signal .",
    "we now assume that the signal propagates through the above @xmath2 channels . in this case , for any input @xmath16 the total input power into the fiber is equal to the total output power , i.e. @xmath17 since @xmath18 . as a result , the matrix @xmath19 has to be unitary , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "a second important property of the scattering matrix relates to its time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is well known that electromagnetic propagation in the absence of external magnetic fields is symmetric under time reversal . in this context",
    ", time reversal corresponds to a change in the direction of propagation and time .",
    "for example , under time - reversal the amplitude of a propagating plane - wave @xmath21 $ ] changes both time @xmath22 and propagation direction @xmath23 .",
    "hence , time - reversal amounts to phase conjugation @xcite . therefore , if propagation through the optical fiber is to be time - reversal invariant , feeding the system with the time - reversed version of the output should produce the original version of the input .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as a result ,",
    "we are left with three different matrices , namely @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these matrices are not independent , since they share the same singular values , since @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to define the matrix @xmath31 as the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of @xmath32 .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere @xcite that @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of @xmath31 by means of a so - called polar decomposition as follows @xmath33 as a result , the information of the scattering matrix @xmath19 is encoded in the matrices @xmath31 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we now discuss two important properties of the scattering matrix as seen from experimental data in the literature , which will help describe it better .",
    "we start with the strength of backscattering , i.e. reflection in optical fibers .",
    "this process is typically due to localized imperfections in the fiber and is sometimes called rayleigh scattering .",
    "the strength of the reflected light is typically proportional to the product of the density of such imperfections and the length of the fiber @xcite , i.e. proportional to the average number of such imperfections over the fiber length travelled . due to the high quality of fiber production techniques",
    "this imperfection density is extremely small .",
    "hence , in @xcite single core fibers have reflection coefficients approximately equal to -120db / mm , which amounts to -30db per 1000 km .",
    "similarly , in @xcite a 25 km single mode fiber has rayleigh backscattered power roughly -30db .",
    "these very low reflected powers appear in single mode fibers , however , we conjecture that they should be quite low for multi - core fibers described below . as a result of this low backscattering amplitudes",
    "we may assume that the reflection in the fiber may discarded , and hence @xmath36 .",
    "a second important property of the scattering matrix in a multicore / multimode fiber is the considerable mixing between core transmissions . for example , in a 60 km three coupled core fiber analyzed in @xcite , the crosstalk is so strong that light injected into one core is equally distributed across all cores in the output .",
    "considerable crosstalk has been seen in other cases , e.g. in @xcite where crosstalk of -25db / km was observed . even if this effect is smaller that in @xcite above due to the different design of the cores ( it results to -8db coupling for 60 km ) , it highlights the relevance and ubiquitous nature of crosstalk in multicore fibers , when they have their cores placed close to each other .",
    "it should be pointed out that the difference in magnitude of backscattering and crosstalk can be attributed to different mechanisms being responsible for the two effects . in the backscattering case , as discussed above , the effect is due to localized scattering@xcite , while in the latter the mechanism is scattering among the core modes due their proximity , or due to bending @xcite .      in summary , we consider fibers with negligible backscattering and strong mixing between core modes .",
    "we assume this mixing to be random over different frequency subbands , due to strong delay spread .",
    "for example , in @xcite 10nsec delay spreads were measured over 700 km transmission over a 6 mode fiber using 50ghz sub - band widths .",
    "hence the transmission matrix @xmath37 will be modelled as a haar random matrix of dimension @xmath38 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath3 transmitting channels and @xmath4 receiving channels , and therefore we only consider a submatrix of the full transmission matrix , which we denote by @xmath34 , since not all transmitting or receiving channels may be available to a given link . for simplicity",
    "we assume that this is the upper left corner of @xmath37 .",
    "we should emphasize that the remaining @xmath39 `` untapped '' channels in @xmath37 can be used to model _ loss _ in the fiber propagation @xcite . indeed , in the limit of large @xmath40 the channel will converge to a gaussian distributed channel,@xcite similar to the case of open space wireless propagation , where the signal loss is significant . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding mimo channel for this system reads @xmath41 with coherent detection and channel state information only at the receiver @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath45 input , the @xmath46 output signal vectors and the @xmath46 unit variance noise vector , respectively , all assumed for simplicity to be complex gaussian .",
    "this assumption is also based on the optical mimo modulation scheme , which uses mzm ( _ mach - zehnder modulator _ ) to modulate a continuous wave ( cw ) laser to generate the digital signal , which is then , transmitted through the fiber .",
    "this modulation is achieved by equally splitting the incoming optical signal and enforcing a time delay ( phase shift ) in one path , before recombining it .",
    "we also assume no mode - dependent loss . as a result",
    ", the mutual information can be expressed as @xmath47 in the last equation @xmath48 is the spectral density of @xmath49 defined as @xmath50 also , `` @xmath51 '' is the natural logarithm , @xmath52 is the average total signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath53 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath54 and we assume for concreteness @xmath55 .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . if @xmath59 , @xcite showed that we may recover the above form by replacing @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above mutual information is used as a performance metric of the channel .",
    "we may now define the main problem we address , namely the calculation of @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the indicator ( step ) function .",
    "we will also analyze the density of @xmath8 i.e. @xmath66\\ ] ] the aim of this paper is to calculate the tails of the distribution of the rate @xmath8 .",
    "the first step is to express the joint distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath54 as derived initially in @xcite and more recently in this context @xcite @xmath67 in the above , @xmath68 is a normalization constant defined in .    in the above equation , we can see that when @xmath69 becomes large , the last term can be approximated roughly as @xmath70 .",
    "this corresponds to the eigenvalue distribution of a wishart matrix @xcite , which is typically used to model wireless mimo channel propagation because the latter has significant power loss in the atmosphere .",
    "hence , it can be seen that the parameter @xmath69 can effectively model power loss through the fiber and provide a continuous cross - over between lossless and lossy fibers @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will show how the above expression can be used to provide a closed form solution for the outage probability , in terms of finite sums of simple functions .",
    "however , it will become clear that for increasing channel numbers , the formula becomes quite cumbersome , without providing much intuition .",
    "hence , in section [ sec : coulombgasmethodology ] a different approach will be adopted , namely the large-@xmath2 analysis of the outage probability using the coulomb gas formalism .",
    "in this section , we will obtain a closed form expression for the outage probability @xmath71 .",
    "we start by introducing an integral representation for the @xmath72 function @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an infinitesimal positive number indicating that the @xmath9-integral goes over the pole at zero . as a result",
    ", the outage probability can be expressed as follows : @xmath75 where the integral notation @xmath76 signifies multiple integration over all @xmath53 for @xmath77 . in appendix",
    "[ app : exactsolution ] we show how the above multiple integral can be evaluated .",
    "the final result can be expressed as follows : @xmath78 where the sum of @xmath79 is over @xmath80^{n_t}$ ] , the sum of @xmath81 is over @xmath82^{n_t}$ ] and the sum over @xmath83 is over all permutations of @xmath84 with signature @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86-dimensional integer vector @xmath87 has components @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the smallest integer for which @xmath90 , while @xmath91 in the above @xmath92 are given in , @xmath68 is given in , while @xmath93 is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the prescription of how to deal with @xmath94 in the case where two or more integers @xmath95 are equal is discussed in appendix [ app : exactsolution ] .",
    "we also note that the density of @xmath8 , @xmath96 , can be obtained directly from the above by differentiation with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "although analytic and in closed form , the above result is handy and provides intuition for the answer at best for small values of @xmath86 , @xmath97 , @xmath69 .",
    "when this is not the case , one needs an alternate path , which can be achieved using the asymptotic approach in @xmath2 , which will be discussed next .",
    "in this section we will follow a complementary approach to the above and will derive the outage probability in the limit of large channel numbers .",
    "the first step is to rewrite the joint distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath54 provided in in the following form @xmath98 where    rcl[eq : energy_fun ] e()&=&-_k=1^n_t ( 1-_k ) -_k=1^n_t ( _ k ) + & -&_kk    @xmath99 represents the normalized potential energy of @xmath86 unit charges bound on the unit interval @xmath100 , while repelling from each other and from the boundaries logarithmically .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that when @xmath2 is large , the charges will coalesce to a smooth density @xmath48 .",
    "this hypothesis , which is originally due to dyson @xcite , and is called the _ coulomb ( or dyson ) gas approach _ , has been used extensively in statistical physics @xcite and more recently in communications @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis was set in a more mathematical footing by @xcite who proved that the large deviations of the law of the spectral density @xmath48 can be described by a rate function corresponding to the continuum limit of @xmath99 .",
    "@xcite showed this for the case of the wigner gaussian matrices , while @xcite generalized it to wishart matrices .",
    "their proof can be directly applied to this model by restricting the support of eigenvalues from @xmath101 to the unit interval @xmath102 .",
    "we will apply this formalism to obtain the tails of @xmath71 .",
    "the first result is summarized in the following theorem , which is proved in appendix [ app : proof_ld ] .",
    "let us first denote by @xmath103 the space of probability measures on @xmath104 , endowed with weak topology .",
    "[ thm : coulomb_gas ]    let    rcl[eq : e(p ) ] [ p]&=&-n_0p(x)(1-x)d x -(-1)p(x)(x)d x + & -&p(x)p(y)dy dx    where @xmath105 .",
    "then    1 .",
    "@xmath106 $ ] is convex on @xmath103 2 .",
    "@xmath106 $ ] obtains its minimum value denoted by @xmath107 at a unique probability density @xmath108 on @xmath104 .",
    "3 .   @xmath109 $ ] where @xmath110    in this paper we mostly interested in the outage probability defined in and therefore the above result is of interest .",
    "however , an analogous result can be obtained for the @xmath111 :    [ cor : coulomb_gas_complement ] if @xmath112 includes the density @xmath108 ( or is arbitrarily close to it ) , then from the above we conclude that @xmath113={\\cal e}_0 $ ] and hence @xmath114 . hence , in this case , we do not strictly speaking have a large deviation event .",
    "nevertheless , in this case it can be shown that the complement of @xmath115 , namely @xmath116 is a large deviation event , i.e. @xmath117\\ ] ]    due to the convexity of @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath115 , it is sufficient to find a local minimum of the functional , subject to the constraints , which then is ensured to be a global minimum .",
    "one handy way to do so is to introduce a lagrangian and include the constraints of normalization and positivity of @xmath48 using lagrange multipliers .",

    "if we find a local minimum for the corresponding lagrangian for @xmath9 , @xmath123 and @xmath122 that satisfy the constraints , this will be a unique one .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the only difference between @xmath129 and @xmath121 above is that the former can be seen as the maximum over @xmath130 $ ] keeping @xmath131 ; this relation will come in handy later , because it allows us to work with @xmath127 and at the very last step set @xmath131 to obtain @xmath129 .",

    "the opposite holds for the case @xmath138 , when @xmath136 is increasing function of @xmath8 . in this case",
