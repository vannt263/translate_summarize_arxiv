    "in nano - electronics , quantitative evaluation of impurity effects is crucial because device properties are strongly influenced by or even built on such effects .",
    "experimentally , the impurities exist and can be doped in nano - devices without knowing their exact locations , so theoretically it is important to predict the averaged transport quantities such as conductance over impurity configurations . the most direct way to obtain the averaged conductance is to generate many different configurations , then calculate the conductance for each configuration , and finally take the mean value .",
    "such a brute - force method is usually used in the mesoscopic systems from diffusive regime to localized regime because it is an exact calculation .",
    "but in order to get good statistics , huge number of configurations has to be generated making it very time - consuming especially for the calculation of conductance fluctuation . when the disorder strength is weak , it is not necessary to use the brute - force method since some analytic approximate method is superior in speed while maintaining the same accuracy . for",
    "this purpose considerable effort has been made to develop approximate techniques , within which the most widely used technique is the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , which is a useful tool to evaluate the configurational averaged one - electron green s function@xcite @xmath6 , and has also been extended to determine the so - called ",
    "vertex corrections\"@xcite for quantities involving two green s functions .",
    "cpa approach has been implemented in the korringa - kohn - rostoker@xcite and linear muffin - tin orbital@xcite for first principles calculations and has many successful applications@xcite .",
    "the central idea of cpa is to find a ",
    "coherent potential \" such that the one - electron green s function evaluated under such potential approximately equals the configurational averaged green s function . as an extension , cpa can also be used to determine the so - called ",
    "vertex corrections\"@xcite for the product of two green s functions .",
    "later , levin _ et al _ also proposed an elegant diagrammatic method to evaluate the hall coefficient which relates to the direct multiple of three green s functions@xcite .",
    "importantly , the cpa approach and its extensions can be combined with local - orbital based dft to calculate the physical properties , such as the band structure and the density of states , of realistic materials .",
    "one example is the development of the so called  kkr - cpa \" , used to study the band structure and density of states of cu - ni@xcite , ag - pd@xcite , and cu - pd@xcite alloys .",
    "the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method has also been proposed@xcite and used to study the electronic structures of metal alloys@xcite .",
    "cpa combined with lmto works very well and has many successful applications .",
    "examples are the investigation of transport properties in disordered magnetic multilayers@xcite , structure of sn - ge alloys@xcite , the electronic structure of non - stoichiometric compounds@xcite , and doped semiconductors@xcite .",
    "the latest development of cpa extended its range of application to non - equilibrium quantum transport problems where impurity average has to be performed .",
    "one prominent work is the  non - equilibrium vertex correction \" ( nvc ) discussed in ref .",
    ". it has been shown by zhuravlev _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that this nvc formalism can be interpreted in terms of the bttiker voltage - probe model so that it is not merely a correction to the electronic structure.@xcite generally speaking , this site - oriented algorithm to evaluate the average conductance is well developed and adopted by different groups.@xcite    in the presence of disorder cpa - nvc approach allows one to calculate non - equilibrium transport properties such as i - v curve and other quantities involving two green s functions .",
    "however , it can not be applied directly to investigate equilibrium transport properties involving four green s functions such as conductance fluctuation and shot noise . since the fluctuation of transport properties of nano - devices , known as `` variation '' of nano - devices , is a very important quantity in nano - electronics and it provides the information on how much the specific device configuration could deviate from the mean value .",
    "we notice that a quantified experiment has been reported to measure such kind of fluctuation@xcite recently .",
    "therefore , it is timely to develop a theoretical formalism that is capable of treating disorder average of four green s functions . to the best of our knowledge , so far this is still an outstanding problem yet to solve based on cpa approach .",
    "one possible reason is that , the nvc could be regarded as a perturbation expansion approach based on cpa to evaluate the conductance by including the ladder diagrams . for conductance fluctuation ,",
    "however , such a partial summation is not good enough . in this paper",
    ", we develop a direct perturbation expansion with respect to the  single - site - t - matrix \" up to a given order which is a good approximation for weak disorder strength or small doping concentration .",
    "we carry out benchmark calculation of average conductance , shot noise , and conductance fluctuation using the direct expansion method on a graphene system and a two - dimensional lattice model with anderson impurities as well as random dopants .",
    "we have compared our results with the brute - force calculation .",
    "we find that a six - order expansion can give very good results for conductance fluctuation and shot noise when disorder strength @xmath0 is comparable to the hopping strength @xmath2 , @xmath7 . in the presence of doping",
    ", our results also show good agreement with that obtained from brute - force method at low doping concentration .",
    "we note that our method can be easily implemented in the first principles transport calculation in nanostructures .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as the following . in section",
    "ii , we briefly revisit cpa formalism and introduce our direct expansion approach to calculate disorder average of four green s functions . an expansion view on nvc method",
    "is also provided . in section iii ,",
    "we compare our results with that obtained from the brute - force method on a graphene system and square lattice of size @xmath8 for two types of disorder : anderson disorder and different doping concentration .",
    "the results for average conductance , shot noise@xcite , and the conductance fluctuation are also presented .",
    "finally we conclude our work in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a tight - binding mode on a square lattice model described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath2 is the nearest neighbor hopping energy and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are electron annihilation and creation operators on atomic site @xmath12 respectively .",
    "we choose @xmath13 as the energy unit .",
    "the on - site energy chosen as @xmath14 is a convention that the energy bottom of the 2d band structure to be zero .",
    "we also assume that the structure of the left and right leads has a similar interaction .",
    "the effect of leads can be taken into account by self - energy@xcite @xmath15 for the left and @xmath16 for the right .",
    "the self - energy of leads can be calculated numerically@xcite .",
    "although the hamiltonian in eq.([h_cent ] ) is very simple , our direct expansion in principle can handle more complicated hamiltonians as long as it only contains single particle interactions .",
    "it is also straightforward to generalize our approach to the case of multi - orbital per site .",
    "here we consider  diagonal disorder\"@xcite with disorder strength @xmath17 on @xmath12th atomic site .",
    "different types of disorder can be described by introducing a  probability function \" for @xmath17 .",
    "we consider two different types of disorder .",
    "one is  anderson disorder \" with the probability function given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is called the strength of anderson disorder .",
    "another is to dope the system with different type of atom : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the doping concentration , and @xmath22 is the energy difference between the dopant and the original atom . in the theoretical formalism we can general types of diagonal disorder including these two types of disorder .      in this subsection",
    ", we revisit the well - developed  single - site cpa \" , because this is the starting point of our direct expansion approach .",
    "cpa is an approximation to evaluate the averaged single - particle retarded or advanced green s function ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) , and it is known to be good in homogeneous ensembles@xcite . in realistic nano - devices with small concentration",
    ", it has been shown that the nvc which based on cpa also works very well.@xcite . in cpa approximation ,",

    "the averaged conductance ( set @xmath43 ) is defined as @xmath44 , and the averaged dc shot noise is proportional to @xmath45 , while the conductance fluctuation reads @xmath46 ^ 2\\rangle-\\langle\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathcal{t})\\rangle^2}$ ] .",
    "the averaged conductance is usually calculated within the nvc approximation .",
    "while the shot noise and conductance fluctuation involve four green s function and nvc approach can not apply here .",
    "our direct expansion approach is to expand them according to eq.([tmat ] ) , together with the t - matrix expansion with respect to single - site - t - matrix @xmath35 as the following : @xmath47 notice that the multiple summation in eq.([tmat_expansion ] ) requires that the successive index should not be the same . plugging this expansion into the expression of conductance fluctuation or shot noise and",
    "generate all the diagrams up to a certain order in @xmath48 and then store them once for all .",
    "here we think @xmath48 is a natural expansion parameter because it describes the on - site scattering and it is a small quantity under small disorder strength and low doping concentration .",
    "with all the diagram generated , the average value of shot noise and conductance fluctuation can be calculated for different systems numerically .",
    "considering the @xmath49 term in the dc shot noise that involves the average of four green s functions @xmath50 , we substitute eq.([tmat ] ) into this expression and it generates several terms up to the fourth order in t - matrix . the terms with only one t - matrix vanish due to eq.([general_cpa_condition ] ) . in the following",
    "we illustrate how to use direct expansion method to generate diagrams for the other terms involving multi - t - matrices .    as an example",
    ", one typical term containing three t - matrices is @xmath51 .",
    "we focus on the average part @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent of randomness .",
    "we expand this average using eq.([tmat_expansion ] ) and truncate the resulting series to a certain order in @xmath48 ( we have obtained 8th order ) .",
    "for this three t - matrices term the lowest order in @xmath48 is three because there is no zero - order term in eq.([tmat_expansion ] ) , and all higher order terms ( we will call them diagrams from now on ) in @xmath48 up to our target order can be generated .",

    "since @xmath48 is a matrix and does not commute with @xmath60 , we have to keep both indices @xmath61 .",
    "obviously , we need to find two things : ( 1 ) how many combinations of @xmath57 we have ; ( 2 ) how many diagrams are there for a particular @xmath57 due to different site indices @xmath62 .    for instance",
    ", up to the 6th order ( @xmath63 ) , we have @xmath64 , @xmath65 along with all their permutations and @xmath66 , totally 10 different combinations .",
    "@xmath56 can be calculated by counting different combinations of @xmath62 and for @xmath67 it is obtained from the following expression , @xmath68\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a six - multiple summation and can be handled using single - site cpa .",
    "the evaluation of disorder average of eq.([expand_2 ] ) seems to be impossible .",
    "however , we note that each @xmath48 is a matrix with only one matrix element ( it becomes a diagonal block matrix in the multi - orbital case , e.g. , if spin - orbit interaction is considered ) , as in eq.([ti_component ] ) .",
    "this simplifies calculation drastically .",
    "in addition , the cpa condition eq.([cpa_condition ] ) , indicates that if the summation index appears only once , the average vanishes .",
    "so we have to find out all possible combinations of those six site indices , and there are many possibilities .",
    "for example , we can have @xmath69 , and this combination gives the following contribution to eq.([expand_2 ] ) @xmath70\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum'_{ijk}(x_1)_{ii } ( g_e^a)_{ij } ( g_e^a)_{jk } ( x_2)_{kk } ( g_e^r)_{kj } ( x_3)_{ji } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\langle\\tau_i^r\\tau_i^a\\rangle\\langle \\tau_j^r\\tau_j^a\\rangle\\langle\\tau_k^r\\tau_k^a\\rangle,%|i\\rangle\\langle j|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime on top of @xmath71 means the indices in the summation are mutually different and @xmath72 is defined after eq.([ti_component ] ) .",
    "another possible combination is @xmath73 which gives @xmath74    alternatively , we can have a much simpler diagrammatic representation of our expansion on the averaged shot noise .",
    "this representation is very similar to that of levin @xcite . as an example , eq.([t3_eg1 ] )",
    "can be diagrammatically expressed as fig.[diagram_shotnoise](a ) while the diagram corresponding to eq.([t3_eg2 ] ) is shown in fig.[diagram_shotnoise](b ) .",
    "the thick lines in diagrams of fig.[diagram_shotnoise ] represent the known matrix @xmath75 , and the black dots represent the single site t - matrix @xmath48 .",
    "diagrammatically , expansion up to sixth order means that we only take into account those diagrams with the number of such black dots less than six .",
    "the thin line between two black dots represents either @xmath27 or @xmath76 , depending on the configuration .",
    "the site indices such as @xmath12 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 should be different one from another , and we should also keep in mind that the indices of two ends of a thin line can not be identical , from eq.([tmat_expansion ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have to connect the repeated site indices with the dashed lines , like fig.[diagram_shotnoise](d ) when we have four t matrices . by constructing such a diagrammatic rule ,",
    "our expansion can be carried out by finding all the topologically distinct diagrams in which the number of black dots(single site t - matrix ) is not more than six .",

    ", width=288,height=172 ]      comparing with the averaged shot noise discussed in the last subsection , the calculation of conductance fluctuation is different .",
    "this is because the shot noise contains one trace while the conductance fluctuation has two traces as can be seen below , @xmath81 ^ 2\\rangle = \\langle\\mathrm{tr}[g^r\\gamma_l g^a\\gamma_r]\\mathrm{tr}[g^r\\gamma_l g^a\\gamma_r]\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we still use the same idea as that of shot noise , we will find the calculation becomes more complicated because we can only write the above equation as @xmath81 ^ 2\\rangle = \\sum_{ij}\\langle(g^r\\gamma_l g^a\\gamma_r)_{ii}(g^r\\gamma_l g^a\\gamma_r)_{jj}\\rangle\\notag\\\\ = \\sum_{ij}\\langle\\mathrm{tr}[g^r\\gamma_l g^a\\gamma_r p^{ij } g^r\\gamma_l g^a\\gamma_r p^{ji}]\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the matrix @xmath82 is the extremely sparse matrix with only one non - zero element , @xmath83 .",
    "it turns out that the mean value of @xmath84 will cost a factor of @xmath85 to the time scale as to evaluate shot noise .",

    "however , in our direct expansion approach , we can get rid of this difficulty by taking the advantage of the property of @xmath48 , eq.([ti_component ] ) , see below .    as before ,",

    "we notice that @xmath95\\rangle$ ] can be calculated accurately using nvc while @xmath95 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] can only be obtained in direct expansion .",
    "to make sure the accuracy of conductance fluctuation , we have to treat these two terms on the equal footing and use direct expansion on both terms . as an example , if we expand @xmath96 to sixth order but still use cpa+nvc to evaluate @xmath97 , the fluctuation obtained is not very accurate . in fig.[fig1](d ) , at @xmath98 , we get @xmath99 from sixth - order expansion and @xmath100 from cpa+nvc , the fluctuation evaluated from these results is then larger than @xmath101 , which deviates from the exact result @xmath102 quite a lot",
    ". however , our sixth - order cumulant expansion directly on fluctuation gives the result @xmath103 , better agreement compared with the exact one .",
    "actually , in order to get the conductance fluctuation , a better way is to do cumulant expansion , which discards all the  disconnected diagrams \" @xcite .",
    "the advantages of such ",
    "cumulant expansion \" include the following separate aspects : 1 .",
    "we can directly attack the fluctuation instead of expand both @xmath96 and @xmath97 , so the computational cost is reduced to nearly a half .",
    "2 . in this way",
    "we can naturally evaluate @xmath96 and @xmath97 on the same footing without to evaluate either of them , and also avoid the error stated in the above paragraph .",
    "this cumulant expansion only include connected diagrams , making the physical meaning more clear because that the connected diagrams only contributes to @xmath104 , which is never needed when we concentrate on the conductance fluctuation . in our case , in one specific index combination ,",
    "if the indices in the first trace do not connect to those in the second trace , then it is a disconnected terms .",
    "for example , in the decomposition ( 11,22 ) , one disconnected term is @xmath105 , while @xmath106 is a connected term . to a certain order ,",

    "we note that up to @xmath115 the method of nvc and brute - force give the same result ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) . for the shot noise ( fig.[fig1](c ) ) ,",
    "the 4th and 5th orders seems to give almost the same result and up to @xmath116 good agreement is reached . for the 6th order expansion the agreement is better for @xmath0 up to 0.5 .",
    "we see that the direct expansion method underestimate the conductance and overestimate the shot noise . for the conductance fluctuation",
    ", the situation is different . from fig.[fig1](d ) we see that the conductance fluctuation is of order @xmath117 which is a well known result in mesoscopic physics .",
    "it is interesting to see that the 4th order expansion is better than 5th and 6th orders .",
    "the range of @xmath0 to have good agreement is @xmath113 .",
    "one thing to note .",
    "although here we benchmark our result on the lattice model with anderson disorder , the previous knowledge such as anderson localization , the universal conductance fluctuation and the percolation theory can not be expected from our approach because those physics require that the strength of disorder large enough and the system enters diffusive and even localization region , but our method can not reach that region due to its perturbative nature .",
    "now we dope the system with a fixed impurity strength @xmath0 and two different doping concentrations .",
    "for @xmath4 doping ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , very good agreement can be obtained for conductance among three methods : nvc , brute - force , and direct expansion up to 6th order in the window of @xmath118 .",
    "for the shot noise and conductance fluctuation , 6th order expansion can give good agreement for @xmath0 up to 1 .",
    "when we increase the doping concentration , our results deviate from that of the brute - force . at @xmath5 doping concentration ( fig.[fig3 ] )",
    "we find that for average conductance , the range of @xmath0 decreases to @xmath119 while for shot noise and conductance fluctuation the agreement is not good beyond @xmath120 .",
    "one word on the computational time . in our proposed expansion method ,",
    "the time cost is dominated by solving the cpa self - consistent equation . as an example , for 2d 40 by 40 lattice model , 10% doping case , we need 11 steps to obtain the cpa solvent and each step 2.5 seconds .",
    "after that , we spend approximately 40 seconds to obtain the fluctuation .",
    "however , this time used together can only be used to calculate approximately 50 configurations , from which even the mean value can not be surely given .",
    "as the system goes larger , our time advantages becomes more obvious .",
    "we have also studies the average conductance , shot noise , and conductance fluctuation in a disordered graphene ribbon system of size @xmath121 with hard - wall boundary condition perpendicular to the transport direction .",
    "here we use the simplest non - spin tight - binding hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice , which is @xmath122 in graphene , the nearest hopping energy is @xmath123 , and we set @xmath13 as the energy unit , then both the fermi energy and and the disorder strength are measured according to it .",
    "besides , in the above hamiltonian , @xmath124 denote the nearest neighbor hopping , with the nearest - neighbor unit vector @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and the lattice constant @xmath128 nm . in the following calculation , we fix the fermi energy @xmath129 where there are 15 incoming channels . for anderson disorder , we see from fig.[fig9 ] that for average conductance good agreement is obtained for disorder strength up to @xmath116 . for shot noise ,",
    "however , the deviation can be seen when @xmath120 . to our surprise , the conductance fluctuation from direct expansion method is good for @xmath0 as large as 0.4",
    ". for low doping concentration at @xmath4 , fig.[fig10 ] shows that good agreement between our method and brute - force method can be reached for average conductance and shot noise with disorder strength up to @xmath115 while for conductance fluctuation reasonable agreement is obtained for @xmath0 up to @xmath130 . for larger doping concentration ,",
    "the agreement is good for smaller disorder strength .",
    "for instance at @xmath5 doping ( fig.[fig11 ] ) , the average conductance is good up to @xmath131 while for shot noise and conductance fluctuation @xmath0 is about 0.4 for a reasonable agreement compared with brute - force method .    .",

    "in this paper , we have developed a direct expansion approach to deal with the average shot noise and the conductance fluctuation for disordered systems .",
    "two kinds of disorder were considered : anderson disorder and the random dopant .",
    "we have bench marked our results on a graphene system and a two dimensional square lattice model .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find that our expansion method up to the 6th order is comparable , although not as good as nvc method for the calculation of averaged conductance .",
    "up to the sixth order , our results of shot noise and conductance fluctuation agree well with the brute - force method for anderson impurities with disorder strength up to @xmath132 for the square lattice and @xmath133 for the graphene system . in the presence of dopant at small doping concentration ( 1% ) our results are good when @xmath0 is around 0.9 . in general ,",
    "up to the same order of expansion , average conductance gives better result than the shot noise and conductance fluctuation while the shot noise is the least accurate quantity .",
    "one can improve the accuracy by going to higher order expansion at the expenses of more cpu time .",
    "since our method is an expansion approach , it can not deal with large disorder strength and high doping concentration .",
    "our formalism can be combined with lmto type of first principles calculation , which can give quantitative prediction to the conductance fluctuation for nano - devices . in the realistic device calculations , such comparisons with brute force method",
    "are also in principle available .",
    "for example , in the realistic doping devices , one can generate a large number of random configurations at the given concentration , and the averaged shot noise as well as conductance fluctuation can be exactly evaluated .",
    "thus our method is controllable and should be successful as long as cpa itself is valid .",
