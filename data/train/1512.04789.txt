    "over the past 20 years orbital angular momentum ( oam ) eigenstates in light and electron waves has been subject to intensive research .",
    "these eigenstates are characterized by a wavefunction @xmath0 in cylindrical coordinates of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the angular coordinate and the integer number @xmath3 is called the topological charge ( tc ) .",
    "being eigenstates of the oam operator they posses a well defined oam of @xmath4 per particle .",
    "preceded by the early theoretical work of nye and berry @xcite and allen et al .",
    "@xcite , numerous ways of creating oam eigenstates have been designed in optics @xcite and electron microscopy @xcite , acoustics @xcite , and neutronics @xcite in optics , these so - called vortex beams have found their way into a vast number of applications ranging from optical tweezers and nanomanipulation @xcite and astrophysics @xcite to telecommunication @xcite .",
    "also , in electron microscopy , theoretical research and early experiments look very promising for vortex beams as a tool to manipulate nanocrystals @xcite and investigate chiral crystals @xcite .",
    "one of the most attractive among these applications is without a doubt magnetic mapping on the atomic scale using the energy loss magnetic chiral dichroism signal from inelastic vortex scattering @xcite .    for most of these applications ,",
    "it is important to control the tc of the vortex beam and to create a beam that is a pure oam eigenstate in stead of a mixture of several oam eigenstates . in order to look for the best setup to create high quality vortex beams",
    ", one has to be able to measure the tc with high accuracy . with this purpose",
    "a variety of methods has been developed for optical beams @xcite , some from which an equivalent setup in electron microscopy was derived @xcite . in optics , besides the total oam of a beam , the local oam density and oam modes can also be measured by modal decomposition @xcite using computer generated holograms .",
    "this approach , however , is not applicable to electron vortex beams , since it requires versatile phase plates that do not yet exist in electron optics .",
    "an interesting type of phase plate is the so - called spiral phase plates ( spp ) . adding only a phase @xmath5 and a tc @xmath3 to the wave in diffraction space , such phase plates can be created even for electron waves @xcite , where they have shown their use as an efficient way to create electron vortex beams . in this paper",
    "we investigate the use of spps as an alternative to detect local oam components in an electron wave .",
    "we analytically derive the action of an spp and verify this with numerical simulations on bessel beams .",
    "we explore the potential of this technique on examples of pure and superpositions of noncentered vortex beams .",
    "finally we investigate how a magnetic dipole can be studied by using spps in an electron microscope .",
    "consider a two dimensional scalar wave function in polar coordinates , @xmath6 . taking the multipole series we write the function as a sum of oam eigenstates of the form @xmath5 , @xmath7 the coefficients @xmath8 are",
    "complex functions of the radial coordinate @xmath9 and are given by @xmath10 which can easily be verified by inserting [ oamcoefficients ] into [ oamdecomposition ] .",
    "we can write the fourier transform in polar coordinates as @xcite @xmath11 by using the jacobi  anger identity @xmath12 we can rewrite @xmath13 as a sum of oam - eigenstates @xmath14 the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 are linked via the @xmath3th - order hankel transform @xmath17 in [ oamdecomposition ] and [ ftoamdecomposition ] we decomposed the function @xmath6 and its fourier transform @xmath13 in a basis of oam - eigenstates .",
    "it is important to note that the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath15 depend on the choice of origin around which the decomposition is made .",
    "changing the origin will change the oam components .",
    "we therefore introduce the notation @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , to denote the oam components for the decomposition around the point @xmath20 .",
    "let us illustrate this by investigating the oam - decomposition of a bessel beam with wave function @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a parameter determining the width of the wave function .",
    "it is clear that the oam coefficients of the beam are given by @xmath23 when the decomposition is made with respect to the center of the beam .",
    "when shifting the beam over a distance @xmath24 in the @xmath25-direction however , the wave is given by the following expression @xmath26 now the oam components become @xmath27 which shows that , indeed , the oam components depend on the point @xmath20 around which one makes the decomposition . +",
    "measuring the oam components of an optical or electron wave is not straightforward because these depend on both the amplitude and phase of the wave .",
    "whereas the amplitude can be easily obtained from an image , the phase has to be retrieved by holographic reconstruction .",
    "for some applications one is more interested in the oam - spectrum rather then the amplitude and phase of the entire wave and it would be more convenient to detect the oam components directly .    with this goal in mind , let us study the effect of inserting a spiral phase plate ( spp ) in the far - field plane of the wave of interest .",
    "these give the wave an extra angular - dependent phase factor @xmath28 to the wave in reciprocal space and adds a tc of @xmath29 to the wave , as illustrated in [ fig : setup ] .     to the wave in fourier space after which an image is taken .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ]    the wave thus is multiplied in fourier space with a phase factor @xmath30 , and the multipole expression in [ ftoamdecomposition ] now becomes @xmath31 going back to real space by taking the fourier transform , we get @xmath32(r,\\phi){\\nonumber\\\\#1&}={\\ensuremath{\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{\\infty}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}}\\!}{k}}\\,}k{\\ensuremath{\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}}\\!}{\\varphi}}\\,}\\tilde{\\psi}_{\\delta m}(k_\\perp,\\varphi)e^{ik_\\perp r\\cos(\\phi-\\varphi)}{\\nonumber\\\\#1&}={\\ensuremath{\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{\\infty}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}}\\!}{k}}\\,}k{\\ensuremath{\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}}\\!}{\\varphi}}\\,}\\sum_{m , m'}\\tilde{a}_{m-\\delta m}(k)e^{im\\varphi}{\\nonumber\\\\#1&}\\hphantom{=}\\times i^{m'}j_{m'}(k r)e^{im'(\\phi-\\varphi)}{\\nonumber\\\\#1&}=2\\pi i^m{\\ensuremath{\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{\\infty}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}}\\!}{k}}\\,}k\\sum_{m}\\tilde{a}_{m-\\delta m}(k ) j_{m}(k r)e^{im\\phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general we can not simplify any further .",
    "however , looking at the point @xmath33 we get using @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 filling in the expression for @xmath15 in [ atilde ] , gives @xmath38 the integral over @xmath22 does not converge when integrating over the entire reciprocal space .",
    "however , in reality the upper boundary of the integral will be finite and determined by the maximum @xmath22 vector @xmath39 , transmitted by the spp , such that the expression becomes @xmath40 with @xmath41 eq .",
    "[ kernel ] is simply the radial part of the fourier transform of a circular spp with radius @xmath39 and tc @xmath29 .",
    "although at @xmath42 its value for @xmath43 goes to zero , with increasing @xmath39 the function becomes more and more condensed around @xmath42 ; see [ fig : tmrk ] . for @xmath44",
    "the radius of the fourier transform of the spp will go to zero and when it is small enough such that @xmath45 is approximately constant over this distance , we can approximate the wavefunction at the origin , [ psim0 ] : @xmath46 with @xmath47 being a normalization constant . here , care must be taken in taking the limit because @xmath8 in [ oamcoefficients ] is not defined for @xmath42 .     in arbitrary units , @xmath9 in units of @xmath48.[fig : tmrk ] ]    the center of the recorded image with a @xmath29-spp finally is given by the modulus squared of [ psim02 ]    @xmath49    [ im0 ] shows that the central point in the image ( i.e. , the point on the optical axis ) only depends on @xmath50 , when the decomposition is made around the point on the optical axis .",
    "up to this point , we only looked at the center of the image .",
    "when we shift the wave of interest in real space , we put a different point on the optical axis of the microscope and the intensity in the center of the new image then is only determined by the @xmath51th component of the decomposition around this new point .",
    "however , the only effect of a shift of the wave in real space is a shift of the image . therefore *",
    "every * point in the image is determined only by the @xmath51th component of the expansion at the corresponding point of the wave in real space , @xmath52 @xmath53 where we call @xmath54 the local oam components of the wave .",
    "this is illustrated in [ fig : besselflags ] , where we compare @xmath55 in two points of the wave function of a bessel beam , [ eq : besselbeam ] , with the intensity in the corresponding point in the spp images with different @xmath29 .    ; see [ eq : besselbeam ] . in the center of the beam ,",
    "the only nonzero oam component is @xmath56 and the intensity in the center will be zero in each but the @xmath57 spp image . in any other point of the wave , all components can be present and the intensity in the spp images varies as such . [ fig : besselflags ] ]    these results explain nicely the observations made by frhapter et al .",
    "@xcite , where they use spp images to enhance the contrast at the edges of phase objects . for regions in the exitwave where the amplitude and phase are constant",
    ", the only nonzero oam component is the @xmath58 component , and inserting a spp will only show regions where the phase or amplitude of the wave is changing , such as at the edge of phase objects .",
    "an obvious application of the spp is the determination of the tc of pure vortex beams .",
    "since their wave function is defined as in [ vortexbeam ] , the oam - decomposition around the center of the beam only has one component , @xmath8 , with @xmath3 being the tc of the beam .",
    "the tc can be determined from images using spps with different tc @xmath29 , where the center of the beam will be dark in every image but the one with spp @xmath59 . in [ fig : besselflags ] this is simulated for a bessel beam with tc @xmath60 . in fourier space",
    "the phase in the central pixel is not defined and we therefore put it equal to zero . in optics a wide range of methods are developed to measure the oam of pure vortex beams by using programmable phase plates . in electron microscopy on the other hand , such programmable phase plates are missing which makes those methods impractical . a spp with arbitrary @xmath29 , however ,",
    "can be made by using magnetized needles @xcite , making the method described here of great future potential .",
    "knowing every point to be determined by the local oam components , let us now look at a slightly more complicated situation of a superposition of two bessel beams with opposite tc and misaligned vortex cores , e.g. , the sum of two shifted bessel beams with tc @xmath61 of which the intensity looks like fig .",
    "a spp with @xmath62 enables us to localize the center of the vortex beam with tc @xmath60 ; see fig .",
    "4(c ) . because the @xmath60-component will be highest around the center of this vortex beam , it will light up in the @xmath57 spp image .",
    "the opposite spp localizes the other vortex core .",
    "positioned at the green x and @xmath60 positioned at the red x. ( a ) phase plot - amplitude plot .",
    "( b ) intensity plot of panel ( a ) .",
    "( c ) image obtained with spp with tc @xmath57 showing the position of the @xmath60 bessel beam .",
    "( d ) image obtained with spp with tc @xmath63 indicating the position of the @xmath64 bessel beam .",
    "[ fig : bessels ] ]    despite the maximum intensity in the images being slightly shifted with respect to the location of the vortex cores because of interference with the other bessel beam , the modal oam decomposition allows us to clearly identify the two opposite vortex cores in a convenient way .",
    "first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the aharonov  bohm phase caused by a magnetic monopole transforms a passing plane electron wave into a vortex electron wave .",
    "in fact , it is this effect that bch et al .",
    "@xcite used to generate electron vortex beams near the tip of a single - domain magnetized needle .",
    "+ following this principle , a magnetic dipole creates two phase singularities in the plane wave electron at the position of its two poles with two opposite tc s depending on the strength of the magnetic flux inside the needle ; see [ fig : magneticdipole].a . here",
    ", two vortices with tc @xmath65 are created at the magnetic poles .",
    "because the magnetic field only causes a phase shift in the plane - wave electron , we can not determine the `` magnetic charge '' of the poles by looking at the intensity of the electron wave in real space .",
    "however , if we apply the oam decomposition proposed in this paper , [ fig : magneticdipole].c and [ fig : magneticdipole].d clearly reveal the position of both ends separately .     and",
    "@xmath63 phase plate , respectively , from which the `` magnetic charge '' of the poles can be deduced .",
    "[ fig : magneticdipole ] ]    note that , although the magnetic dipole only causes a phase shift , we do observe intensity in the @xmath66 image .",
    "this effect is due to the way we choose to show the simulations . for the @xmath43 spp images ,",
    "the phase of the phase plate in the center of reciprocal space is ill - defined .",
    "therefore we put the central pixel equal to zero . for comparison with the @xmath67 spp images , in the @xmath68 image we also put the central pixel in fourier space equal to zero .",
    "this is equivalent with a dark field image which causes the phase shift to become visible .",
    "however , the polarity of both poles remains undetectable without a spp and the contrast is low .",
    "inserting a @xmath29 spp in the back focal plane of a microscope allows us to look at the local oam component @xmath69 defined in [ eq : localoam ] . as can be seen in [ fig : besselflags ] , this can be used to determine the oam of a pure vortex beam , where the intensity at the center of the beam is zero except for the @xmath70 spp image .",
    "the local character of the oam - measurement with spps allows us to localize the center of individual vortex beams when looking at a sum of misaligned vortex beams with different oam ; see [ fig : bessels ] .",
    "we can extend this to look at the signature of certain magnetic fields imposed on a free - electron wave . looking with a spp at an electron wave after interaction with a magnetic dipole , for instance ,",
    "clearly localizes the position of the individual poles as well as their `` magnetic charge '' .",
    "all setups looked at in this work , require multiple spps that add different amounts of tc to the electron wave in diffraction space .",
    "this is done preferentiallyby one single spp where the tc can be chosen freely .",
    "although this has not been achieved yet , which is why no experiments are included in this paper , significant progress has been made recently in this field .",
    "bch et al @xcite showed that the tip of a magnetized needle centered on a circular aperture , generates a spp with oam determined by the magnetic flux inside the needle . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same authors demonstrated a spp where the magnetization of the needle is changed by the external field of a macroscopic solenoid around it , thus changing the sign of the tc in microsecond intervals . by replacing the magnetic needle with a microscopic solenoid",
    ", a fully dynamical spp could be created where the tc can take any value by controlling the current running through the coil .",
    "note that we do not consider this a fully programmable phase plate , because this would require full control of the phase in any point of the wave separately .",
    "another possibility is to insert a so - called fork aperture @xcite into the back focal plane of the microscope , which should also give a series of @xmath29 images spaced apart .",
    "we investigated the use of spiral phase plates ( spps ) as a tool to measure the local orbital angular momentum ( oam ) components of photons , electrons , or any other wave function .",
    "we found that inserting a spp that adds a phase factor @xmath71 to the wave in the back focal plane gives a real - space image in @xmath72 that is proportional to @xmath55 , the @xmath29th local oam component around the point @xmath20 ; see [ imr ] .",
    "not only does this explain the observations made by frhapter et al.@xcite , where a spp visualizes the edges of phase objects in electron microscopy , it also enables us to study oam components on the local level in a similar way to the oam - mode decomposition using computer generated holograms as described by dudley et al .",
    "@xcite and schulze et al . @xcite . the main advantage of the spp method , however , is that it can also be applied to systems for which programmable phase plates are not available as in , e.g. , electron microscopes .",
    "we demonstrated by means of numerical simulations how this setup can be used to determine the oam of pure electron vortex beams where the intensity in the center of a beam with topological charge ( tc ) @xmath3 is only nonzero by using a @xmath70 spp . also for beams that are a sum of misaligned vortex beams with different tcs , the center of each vortex and its corresponding tc",
    "can be determined from a series of images with different spps . in a last example we showed a hint of the potential use of spps in electron microscopes to study magnetic materials by simulating the spp images for a plane wave passing a magnetic dipole that adds local oam to the electron . by using our method ,",
    "the position of the magnetic poles as well as their `` magnetic charg '' can be determined .",
    "although fully controllable phase plates do not yet exist in electron microscopy , the method described in this paper only requires the use of spps .",
    "these phase plates already are made bu using magnetic `` monopole - like '' fields at the tip of a magnetized needle @xcite of which the sign of the topological charge can be changed in only a few microseconds @xcite .",
    "full control of the tc could be achieved by replacing the magnetic needle by a microscopic solenoid or a so - called fork aperture @xcite .",
