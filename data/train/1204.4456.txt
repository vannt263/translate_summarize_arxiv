    "significant populations of star - forming galaxies have recently been discovered at high redshifts , @xmath15 , towards the end of the reionization epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "many of these galaxies have been identified due to their excess emission in narrow - band images centred on the redshifted ly@xmath1 wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; such systems are referred to as ly@xmath1 emitters ( hereafter laes ) .",
    "the star - formation rates determined from measurements of the rest - frame uv continuum emission in laes at @xmath16 tend to be low , @xmath17  m@xmath18  yr@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the size of the emission region is typically small , @xmath19  kpc @xcite .",
    "laes thus appear to be relatively small galaxies , probably undergoing quiescent star formation .",
    "however , a recent subaru narrow - band imaging survey has discovered a highly extended lae at @xmath20 , with a spatial extent of @xmath21  kpc , far larger than that of the bulk of the @xmath16 lae population @xcite .",
    "the object , `` himiko '' , also has a far higher ly@xmath1 line luminosity , @xmath22  erg  s@xmath5 , than any other lae at @xmath23 .",
    "both the large size and the high lyman-@xmath1 luminosity make himiko similar to the `` lyman-@xmath1 blobs '' ( labs ) , that have so far been detected at @xmath24 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the labs discovered at @xmath7 are extremely large ( @xmath25  kpc in size ) ly@xmath1-emitting nebulae that show a striking correlation with over - dense regions in the universe .",
    "these have ly@xmath1 luminosities @xmath26  erg  s@xmath5 , similar to the luminosities seen in massive high-@xmath9 radio galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , but do not show radio emission .",
    "follow - up multi - wavelength studies have shown that labs tend to be associated with bright sub - millimeter or infrared - luminous galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) or obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. @xcite ) , often with high star formation rates ( @xmath27  m@xmath12  per year ) .",
    "spitzer _ studies have found that the infrared ( ir ) images of 60% of @xmath7 labs are consistent with an origin due to star formation , with the remaining 40% of the sample likely to arise either due to agn activity or an extreme starburst @xcite .",
    "a few labs have also been detected without a known associated bright galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "no labs have so far been detected at low redshifts , @xmath28 @xcite ; the blobs thus appear to be a high - redshift phenomenon .",
    "the fact that labs are typically located in over - dense regions suggests that they are linked to the formation of the massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although a number of mechanisms have been suggested for the sources that power the ly@xmath1 emission ( e.g. cooling inflows of gas , outflows of gas from starburst galaxies or agns , or even agn photoionization ; @xcite ) , it appears unclear whether any single mechanism is capable of explaining the entire lab population .",
    "however , while cooling radiation from gas streams may contribute some fraction of the lab power @xcite , radiative transfer calculations have shown that such streams of halo gas can not account for all the ly@xmath1 luminosity @xcite .",
    "galaxy formation must hence be responsible for a significant fraction of the ly@xmath1 emission from labs .",
    "studies of the star formation activity of galaxies in the vicinity of labs are thus essential to understanding their nature . observations of molecular and atomic gas tracers in the labs would provide crucial insight into the fuel for star formation .",
    "the most effective means of studying the cold molecular gas reservoir in high-@xmath9 galaxies is through observations of redshifted co line emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , which provide a means of studying gas kinematics and estimating the total molecular gas mass available for star formation .    at present , only two labs have been searched for co line emission , both at @xmath7 , but with no detections of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "we present here a search for  line emission in the @xmath2 lab , himiko , in order to measure its cold molecular gas mass and constrain the kinematics of the interstellar gas in a massive galaxy during the epoch of reionization.cdm cosmology , with @xmath29  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite . ]",
    "the target of our co line observations , `` himiko '' , is a giant ( @xmath32  kpc ) lae at @xmath33 , discovered in the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep survey @xcite .",
    "himiko has an extremely high ly@xmath1 line luminosity , l(ly@xmath1)@xmath34  erg  s@xmath5 , well into the lab category .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission yields a star - formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath35  m@xmath12/yr @xcite ; however , this is likely to be an underestimate by a factor of at least a few , given that the ly@xmath1 line is both resonantly scattered by dust , and , for these redshifts , attenuated due to absorption by the damping wing of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the sfr of himiko is thus likely to be significantly larger than the estimate of @xmath36  m@xmath12/yr . @xcite",
    "used fits of stellar synthesis models to the spectral energy distribution over the optical to near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelength range to obtain an extremely high stellar mass , @xmath37  m@xmath12 , indicating that himiko is a massive galaxy .",
    "the large transverse size of the ly@xmath1-emitting region is also consistent with himiko being an extremely massive object , in the context of hierarchical models of structure formation .",
    "it is thus an excellent candidate for a search for the molecular gas that fuels its high rate of star formation .",
    "observations of the  line emission in himiko were made with the 110 m green bank telescope ( gbt ) in project agbt10b-010 , using the ka - band receiver which covers the frequency range @xmath38  ghz . at the redshift of himiko ,",
    "the  line ( @xmath39  ghz ) is redshifted to 30.354  ghz .",
    "the gbt beam at this frequency has a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath40 , corresponding to a spatial extent of @xmath41  kpc at @xmath42 .",
    "the gbt autocorrelation spectrometer was set up to sample two 800  mhz if bands at this frequency , overlapping by 200  mhz , with a single polarization and 2048 channels per band .",
    "the total velocity coverage was @xmath43  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "bandpass calibration was carried out using sub - reflector nodding with a cycle time of 6  seconds .",
    "while sub - reflector nodding has high observing overheads , it has been shown to yield excellent spectral baselines in earlier gbt ka - band observations , far better than have been obtained with standard position - switching .",
    "observations of 3c147 were used to correct the large - scale baseline structure in the target spectra and to calibrate the flux density scale , which we estimate to be accurate to 10% .",
    "typical system temperatures were 35  k throughout the observations .",
    "the total on - source time was 4  hours .",
    "the data were analyzed using the gbtidl data analysis package , following standard procedures .",
    "the data were first visually inspected and any data affected by correlator failures or radio frequency interference were edited out .",
    "next , the narrow expected line width ( 250  km / s , or 25.5  mhz if the co linewidth is similar to that of the ly@xmath1 line ) relative to the size of each 800  mhz if band , meant that we were able to fit and subtract out a 5th - order polynomial baseline from each individual spectrum , without affecting structure on the scales of the expected line emission .",
    "after flux density and bandpass calibration and baseline subtraction , the data were inspected for any residual baseline structure that might introduce spurious signals into the final spectrum .",
    "around 10% of the data were found to be affected by such artefacts and were edited out .",
    "the individual spectral records were than averaged together , weighting by the system temperature , to produce the final co spectrum .",
    "this was then hanning - smoothed and re - sampled , before further boxcar smoothing and re - sampling to resolutions of 50 , 100 , 150 and 250  km / s .",
    "the two panels of figure  1 show the final  spectra of himiko at velocity resolutions of 100  km  s@xmath5  ( left panel ) and 250  km  s@xmath5  ( right panel ) .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) noise is 99  @xmath44jy per 100  km  s@xmath5  channel and 68  @xmath44jy per 250  km / s channel .",
    "no statistically - significant spectral features are visible in either spectrum .    our non - detection of  line emission in himiko places strong constraints on the co line luminosity .",
    "the co line luminosity , @xmath45 , can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the observing frequency ( in ghz ) , @xmath48 is the luminosity distance ( in mpc ) , and @xmath45 is in k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath49 @xcite . in the case of a non - detection , @xmath50 ( in jy  km  s@xmath5 ) gives the @xmath3 upper limit on the integrated flux density in the  line , where @xmath51 is the rms noise at the velocity resolution @xmath52 .",
    "we assume a line width of @xmath53  km  s@xmath5 , from the observed ly@xmath1 line width and similar to the median observed line width in quasar host galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a @xmath3 limit of @xmath54  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 on the  line luminosity .    assuming that the  line emission is thermalized",
    ", we can use the co line luminosity limit to obtain an upper limit to the cold molecular gas mass in himiko , assuming an appropriate conversion factor , @xmath55 , from line luminosity to molecular gas mass @xcite .",
    "this factor can vary between 0.8 and 4.6  m@xmath18  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 , depending on whether the galaxy is an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) undergoing starburst activity ( @xmath56  m@xmath12  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath57)@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a more quiescent object like the milky way ( @xmath58  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath57)@xmath5 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this factor may be even higher in regions of low metallicity gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as those expected to be found within the interstellar medium of laes in the early universe .",
    "however , massive galaxies like himiko are unlikely to have such low metallicities , especially given its high inferred stellar mass ( @xmath59  m@xmath12 ) .",
    "previous studies of line emission in two laes at @xmath60 by @xcite adopted a low @xmath55 factor , similar to ulirg values , based on the elevated star formation rates in these objects .",
    "we note that @xcite argues that the @xmath55 factor in these systems should be closer to the milky way value . for a ulirg conversion factor ,",
    "@xmath11  m@xmath12  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath57)@xmath5 , we obtain the limit m(h@xmath10 )  @xmath61  m@xmath18 ( 3-@xmath62 ) on the molecular gas mass of himiko .",
    "@xcite obtain a stellar mass of @xmath63  m@xmath12 from a fit to the spectral energy distribution ; the molecular gas mass is thus less than the stellar mass by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , assuming a milky way conversion factor , @xmath64  m@xmath12  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath57)@xmath5 , yields the limit m(h@xmath10 )  @xmath65  m@xmath12 ( @xmath3 ) on the gas mass .",
    "our limit on the co line luminosity in himiko can be converted to a limit on the total far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity due to star formation .",
    "the best - fit parametrization of the relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath45 , valid for nearby spiral galaxies and starbursts , is @xmath67 @xcite . assuming that this relationship also holds for the interstellar medium of high-@xmath9 labs , our upper limit to the co line luminosity yields the upper limit @xmath68",
    "l@xmath18 on the total fir luminosity . using the relation of @xcite to convert this limit on the fir luminosity to a limit on the obscured sfr",
    ", we obtain @xmath69  m@xmath12  yr@xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the lower limit of sfr  @xmath70  m@xmath12  yr@xmath5 obtained from the lyman-@xmath1 line luminosity , even if obscuration / absorption effects cause the sfr derived from the lyman-@xmath1 line to be underestimated by a factor of a few .",
    "searches for co emission have been carried out in only two labs , labd05 at @xmath71 and ssa22-lab01 at @xmath72 , prior to this work @xcite .",
    "these authors used the iram  30 m telescope to observe the co  5 - 4 and co  3 - 2 transitions in labd05 and the plateau de bure interferometer to observe the co  4 - 3 and co  3 - 2 lines in ssa22-lab01 .",
    "the non - detections yielded limits of @xmath73  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 ( labd05 ) and @xmath74  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 ( ssa22-lab01 ) , similar to our limit on the  line luminosity in the @xmath2 lab .",
    "we note , in passing , that similar limits on the co line luminosity have been obtained from gbt co  _ j_=1 - 0 studies of two laes at @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "thus , at present , there is no evidence for significant amounts of molecular gas in high-@xmath9 labs , despite their large stellar masses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the co luminosity in labs appears to be significantly lower than that in the luminous quasar host galaxy population at @xmath23 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in sub - mm starburst and quasar host galaxies at @xmath77 , as well as in quiescent b@xmath9k - selected disk galaxies at @xmath78 ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that the conversion factor from co line luminosity to molecular gas mass is highly uncertain in high-@xmath9 galaxies . a low conversion factor [ @xmath11  m@xmath12  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath49)@xmath5 ] , applicable to the local ulirg population , is usually assumed for fir - luminous objects like high-@xmath9 sub - mm galaxies and quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , values closer to ones found in the milky way have been obtained in star - forming b@xmath9k - selected galaxies at @xmath78 [ @xmath80  m@xmath18  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath57 ; @xcite ] .",
    "while studies of the high-@xmath9 lab and lae population have typically assumed the ulirg conversion factor ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is quite possible that a high conversion factor is applicable to laes and labs at @xmath81",
    ". this may be especially critical for the @xmath23 lae population , which appears to consist of relatively small galaxies with low sfrs , @xmath82  m@xmath12  yr@xmath5 , and low stellar masses , @xmath83  m@xmath12 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a low co - to - h@xmath10 conversion factor value would imply that detections of  co line emission would be extremely challenging in these systems , even with new facilities like the expanded very large array ( evla ) or the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "for example , the  line from a @xmath84 lae with sfr=@xmath85  m@xmath12  yr@xmath5 would be redshifted to a frequency of @xmath86  ghz with a peak flux density of @xmath87  @xmath44jy , assuming a line fwhm of @xmath88  km  s@xmath5 ) , if we assume @xmath64  m@xmath18  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 .",
    "detecting such a line would require hundreds of hours with either the evla q - band receivers or the alma band-1 receivers .",
    "this issue would be exacerbated for the @xmath23 laes if , as it is likely ( e.g. @xcite ) , they are low - metallicity systems . for such systems , with metallicities similar to the smc , the co - to - h@xmath10 conversion factor could be as high as 30  m@xmath12  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 @xcite , making it even harder to detect redshifted co emission .",
    "similarly , the models of @xcite also suggest that the detection of   co line emission in @xmath20 laes will not be possible in reasonable alma integration times .",
    "we present results from a deep gbt search for redshifted  line emission in himiko , a lyman-@xmath1 blob at @xmath2 .",
    "we do not detect  line emission , with an upper limit of @xmath89  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 .",
    "this limit is similar to the limits on the co line luminosity obtained in two labs at @xmath7 by @xcite and in two lyman-@xmath1 emitters at @xmath8 by @xcite . despite their high stellar masses , high-@xmath9 labs appear to have significantly lower co line luminosities than luminous quasars or sub - mm galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "our constraint on the co line luminosity implies an upper limit of m(h@xmath10 )  @xmath90  m@xmath12 on the molecular gas mass , assuming a ulirg conversion factor , @xmath11  m@xmath12  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 .",
    "however , it should be noted that this conversion factor is unknown for labs . a high value of @xmath55 , similar to values in the milky way or @xmath78",
    "b@xmath9k galaxies , would make it extremely difficult to detect co line emission from labs and laes at @xmath15 , even for upcoming telescopes like alma and the evla .",
