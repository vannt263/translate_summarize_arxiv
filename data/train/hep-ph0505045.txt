    "we start with eq .  ( 1.3 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath199 which describes the interaction of a quark with a gluon . in momentum space",
    "the above expression becomes @xmath200 where @xmath201 ( @xmath86 ) is the momentum carried by the incoming quark ( gluon ) .",
    "the feynman parametrization gives @xmath202 where the variable change @xmath203 , @xmath204 , has been applied .    in the case we are considering ,",
    "the gluon momentum @xmath86 is of @xmath69 , since the @xmath0 meson is dominated by soft dynamics .",
    "we expand the above expression up to @xmath205 : @xmath206 the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) , contributing to a phase factor @xcite , will be dropped . for convenience ,",
    "we work in the light - cone gauge @xmath207 , in which the second and third terms are rewritten as @xmath208 it is clear that the field strength @xmath209 can be factored together with the rescaled @xmath5 quark field @xmath38 and the light quark field @xmath210 into the nonlocal matrix element in eq .",

    "the integrand depending on @xmath201 is then identified as the hard kernel in momentum space for the three - parton contribution .",
