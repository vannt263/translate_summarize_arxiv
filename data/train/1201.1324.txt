    "one of the main themes of @xmath5-geometry was and is to give meaning to an idea of jacques tits that dates back to 1956 ( see section 13 in @xcite ) .",
    "namely , tits proposed that there should be a theory of algebraic groups over a field of `` caractristique une '' , which explains certain analogies between geometries over finite fields and combinatorics .    there are good expositions of tits ideas from a modern viewpoint ( for instance , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the following example that falls into this line of thought .",
    "the number of @xmath6-rational points @xmath7 of the general linear group is counted by a polynomial @xmath8 in @xmath9 with integral coefficients . the limit @xmath10 counts the elements of the weyl group @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "the same holds for any standard parabolic subgroup @xmath13 of @xmath12 whose weyl group @xmath14 is a parabolic subgroup of the weyl group @xmath4 . while the group @xmath7 acts on the coset space @xmath15 , which are the @xmath6-rational points of a flag variety , the weyl group @xmath11 acts on the quotient @xmath16 , which is the set of decompositions of @xmath17 into subsets of cardinalities that correspond to the flag type of @xmath18 .    the analogy of chevalley groups over finite fields and their weyl groups entered @xmath5-geometry as the slogan : @xmath5-geometry should provide an @xmath5-model @xmath3 of every chevalley group @xmath2 whose group @xmath19 of @xmath5-rational points equals the weyl group @xmath4 of @xmath2 .",
    "many authors contributed to this problem : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( this list is roughly in the order of appearance , without claiming to be complete ) .",
    "however , there is a drawback to this philosophy .",
    "recall that the weyl group @xmath4 of a chevalley group @xmath2 is defined as the quotient @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a split maximal torus of @xmath2 and @xmath22 is its normalizer in @xmath2 . under certain natural assumptions ,",
    "a group isomorphism @xmath23 yields an embedding @xmath24 of groups that is a section of the quotient map @xmath25 .",
    "however , such a section does exist in general as the example @xmath26 witnesses ( see problem b in the introduction of @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "this problem was circumvented in different ways .",
    "while some approaches restrict themselves to treat only a subclass of chevalley groups over @xmath5 ( in the case of @xmath12 , for instance , one can embed the weyl group as the group of permutation matrices ) , other papers describe chevalley groups merely as schemes without mentioning a group law .",
    "the more rigorous attempts to establish chevalley groups over @xmath5 are the following two approaches . in the spirit of tits later paper @xcite , which describes the extended weyl group , connes and consani tackled the problem by considering schemes over @xmath27 ( see @xcite ) , which stay in connection with the extended weyl group in the case of chevalley groups . in the author s",
    "earlier paper @xcite , two different classes of morphisms were considered : while rational points are so - called _ strong morphisms _ , group laws are so - called _",
    "weak morphisms_.    in this paper , we choose a different approach : we break with the convention that @xmath28 should be the weyl group of @xmath2 . instead , we consider a certain category @xmath29 of @xmath5-schemes that comes together with `` base extension '' functors @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "we will omit the superscript `` @xmath32 '' also at other places of the introduction to be closer to the standard notation of algebraic geometry .",
    "an explanation for the need of the additional superscript is given in section [ subsection : notation - and - conventions ] .",
    "] to usual schemes and @xmath33 to sets . roughly speaking",
    ", a _ tits - weyl model _ of a chevalley group @xmath2 is an object @xmath3 in @xmath29 together with a morphism @xmath34 such that @xmath35 together with @xmath36 is isomorphic to @xmath2 as a group scheme and such that @xmath37 together with @xmath38 is isomorphic to the weyl group of @xmath2 .",
    "we call the category @xmath29 the _ tits category _ and the functor @xmath39 the weyl extension .",
    "before we proceed with a more detailed description of the tits category , we explain the fundamental idea of tits - weyl models in the case of the chevalley group @xmath40 .",
    "the standard definition of the scheme @xmath41 is as the spectrum of @xmath42=\\z[t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4]/(t_1t_4-t_2t_3 - 1)$ ] , which is a closed subscheme of @xmath43 $ ] .",

    "this differs from the conventions that are used in the main text , but this incoherence does not have any consequences for the following considerations .",
    "] of all monomials in @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "its prime ideals are the subsets @xmath51 of @xmath52 $ ] where @xmath53 ranges to all subsets of @xmath54 .",
    "note that this means @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath57 .",
    "if one applies the naive intuition that prime ideals are closed under addition and subtraction to the equation @xmath58 then the points of @xmath59 should be the prime ideals @xmath60 that do not contain both terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this yields the set @xmath63 , which can be illustrated as        where the vertical lines express the inclusion relation @xmath64 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the two maximal ideals @xmath65 and @xmath66 of this set correspond to the subscheme @xmath67 of diagonal matrices and the subscheme @xmath68 of anti - diagonal matrices of @xmath41 , respectively , which , in turn , correspond to the elements of the weyl group @xmath20 where @xmath69 is the diagonal torus and @xmath22 its normalizer .",
    "this example was the starting point for the development of the geometry of blueprints .",
    "a formalism that puts the above ideas on a solid base is explained in the preceeding part i of this paper ( see @xcite ) .",
    "please note that we give brief definitions of blueprints and blue schemes in the introduction of part i. in the proceeding , we will assume that the reader is familiar with this .",
    "it is the topic of this paper to generalize the above heuristics to other chevalley groups and to introduce a class of morphisms that allows us to descend group laws to morphisms of the @xmath5-model of chevalley groups .",
    "note that the approach of @xcite is of a certain formal similarity : the tori of minimal rank in a torification of @xmath41 are the diagonal torus and the anti - diagonal torus .",
    "indeed the ideas of @xcite carry over to our situation .    the _ rank space _",
    "@xmath70 of a blue scheme @xmath71 is the set of the so - called `` points of minimal rank '' ( which would be the points @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the above example ) together with certain algebraic data , which makes it a discrete blue scheme .",
    "a _ tits morphism _ @xmath72 between two blue schemes @xmath71 and @xmath73 will be a pair @xmath74 of a morphism @xmath75 between the rank spaces and a morphism @xmath76 between the associated semiring schemes '' from the preceeding part i of this paper for reasons that are explained in section [ subsection : notation - and - conventions ] . ]",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 that satisfy a certain compatibility condition .    the tits category @xmath29 is defined as the category of blue schemes together with tits morphisms .",
    "the weyl extension @xmath79 is the functor that sends a blue scheme @xmath71 to the underlying set @xmath80 of its rank space @xmath70 and a tits morphism @xmath72 to the underlying map @xmath81 of the morphism @xmath82 .",
    "the base extension @xmath30 sends a blue scheme @xmath71 to the scheme @xmath83 and a tits morphism @xmath72 to the morphism @xmath84 .",
    "note that we can replace @xmath85 by a semiring @xmath86 , which yields a base extension @xmath87 for every semiring @xmath86 .",
    "we obtain the diagram @xmath88^{\\cw}\\ar[dr]^{(\\blanc)^+ } \\\\ & { \\operatorname{sch}_\\n } \\ar[r]^{(\\blanc)_k }    & { \\operatorname{sch}_k}}.\\ ] ]      the main result of this paper is that a wide class of chevalley groups has a tits - weyl model .",
    "this includes the special and the general linear groups , symplectic groups , special orthogonal groups ( of both types @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) and all chevalley groups of adjoint type .",
    "next to this , we obtain tits - weyl models for split tori , parabolic subgroups of chevalley groups and their levi - subgroups .    the strength of the theory of tits - weyl models can be seen in the following reasons .",
    "this puts it , in particular , in contrast to earlier approaches towards @xmath5-models of algebraic groups ,    _ intrinsic definition through explicit formulas _",
    "tits - weyl models are determined by explicit formulas ( as @xmath91 in the case of @xmath40 ) , which shows that tits - weyl models are geometric objects that are intrinsically associated to representations in terms of generators and relations of the underlying scheme .",
    "the examples in appendix [ app : examples ] show that they are indeed accessible via explicit calculations .",
    "in other words , we can say that every linear representation of a group scheme @xmath2 yields an @xmath5-model @xmath3 .",
    "the group law of @xmath2 descends uniquely ( if at all ) to a tits morphism @xmath34 that makes @xmath3 a tits - weyl model of @xmath2 .",
    "_ unified approach towards thick and thin geometries _",
    "tits - weyl models combine the geometry of algebraic groups ( over fields ) and the associated geometry of their weyl groups in a functorial way .",
    "this has applications to a unified approach towards thick and thin geometries as alluded by jacques tits in @xcite .",
    "a treatment of this will be the matter of subsequent work .",
    "_ functorial extension to blueprints and semirings _    a chevalley group @xmath2 can be seen as a functor @xmath92 from rings to groups .",
    "a tits - weyl model @xmath3 of @xmath2 can be seen as an extension of @xmath92 to a functor @xmath93 from blueprints to monoids whose values @xmath94 and @xmath95 stay in close connection to the weyl group and the extended weyl group ( see theorem [ thm : properties of tits - weyl groups ] ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath93 is a functor on the subclass of semirings .",
    "this opens applications to geometry that is build on semirings ; by name , to idempotent analysis as considered by kolokoltsov and maslov , et al .",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite ) , tropical geometry as considered itenberg , mikhalkin , et al .",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite and , in particular , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) ) , idempotent geometry that mimics @xmath5-geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and analytic geometry from the perspective of paugam ( see @xcite ) , which generalizes berkovich s and huber s viewpoints on ( non - archimedean ) analytic geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .      the guiding idea in the formulation of the theory of tits - weyl models is to descend algebraic groups `` as much as possible '' .",
    "this requires us to relinquish many properties that are known from the theory of group schemes , and to substitute these losses by a formalism that has all the desired properties , which are , roughly speaking , that the category and functors of interest are cartesian and that chevalley groups have a model such that its weyl group is given functorially . as a consequence ,",
    "we yield only monoids instead of group objects and there are no direct generalizations to relative theories  with one exception : there is a good relative theory over @xmath27 . tits monoids over @xmath27 are actually much easier to treat : the rank space has a simpler definition that does not require inverse closures , the universal semiring scheme is a scheme , tits - weyl models over @xmath27 are groups in @xmath29 and many subtleties in the proofs about the existence of @xmath96 in certain blueprints vanish .",
    "note that the tits - weyl models that are established in this paper , immediately yield tits - weyl models over @xmath27 by the base extension @xmath97 from @xmath5 to @xmath27 .",
    "the strategy of this paper is to establish tits - weyl models by a case - by - case study .",
    "there are many ( less prominent ) chevalley groups that are left out . only for adjoint",
    "chevalley groups , we construct tits - weyl models in a systematic way by considering their root systems .",
    "this raises the problem of the classification of tits - weyl models of chevalley groups .",
    "in particular , the following questions suggest themselves .",
    "* does every chevalley group have a tits - weyl model ?",
    "is there a systematic way to establish such tits - weyl models ? *",
    "as explained before , a linear representation of a chevalley group defines a unique tits - weyl model if at all .",
    "when do different linear representations of chevalley groups lead to isomorphic tits - weyl models ? can one classify all tits - weyl models in a reasonable way ?",
    "* every tits - weyl model of a chevalley group in this text comes from a `` standard '' representation of the chevalley group .",
    "can one find a `` canonical '' tits - weyl model ?",
    "what properties would such a canonical tits - weyl model have among all tits - weyl models of the chevalley group ?",
    "see  appendix [ app : tits - weyl models of type a_1 ] for the explicit description of some tits - weyl models of type @xmath98 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : background ] , we provide the necessary background on blue schemes to define the rank space of a blue scheme and the tits category .",
    "this section contains a series of results that are of interest of its own while other parts are straightforward generalizations of facts that hold in usual scheme theory ( as the results on sober spaces , closed immersions , reduced blueprints and fibres of morphisms ) .",
    "we try to keep these parts short and omit some proofs that are in complete analogy with usual scheme theory . instead , we remark occasionally on differences between the theory for blue schemes and classical results .",
    "the more innovative parts of section [ section : background ] are the following .",
    "in section [ subsection : mixed_characteristics ] , we investigate the fact that a blue field can admit embeddings into semifields of different characteristics , which leads to the distinction of the _ arithmetic characteristic _ and the _ potential characteristics _ of a blue field and of a point @xmath99 of a blue scheme .",
    "section [ subsection : fibres - of - morphisms ] shows that the base extension morphism @xmath100 is surjective ; in case @xmath71 is cancellative , also the base extension morphism @xmath101 is surjective . from the characterization of prime semifields in section [ subsection : mixed_characteristics ] , it follows that the points of a blue scheme are dominated by algebraic geometry over algebraically closed fields and idempotent geometry over the semifield @xmath102 . in section [",
    "subsection : products ] , we investigate the underlying topological space of the fibre product of two blue schemes .",
    "in contrast to usual scheme theory , these fibre products are always a subset of the cartesian product of the underlying sets . in section [ subsection : relative additive closures ] , we define _ relative additive closures _ , a natural procedure , which will be of importance for the definition of rank spaces in the form of _ inverse closures_. as a last piece of preliminarily theory , we introduce _ unit fields _ and _ unit schemes _ in section [ subsection : unit field and unit scheme ] .",
    "namely , the unit field of a blueprint @xmath103 is the subblueprint @xmath104 of @xmath103 , which is a blue field . in section",
    "[ section : the tits category ] , we introduce the tits category . in particular , we define _ pseudo - hopf points _ and the _ rank space _ in section [ subsection : rank space ] and investigate the subcategory @xmath105 of blue scheme that consists of rank spaces .",
    "such blue schemes are called _ blue schemes of pure rank_. in section [ subsection : tits morphisms ] , we define _ tits morphisms _ and investigate its connections with usual morphisms between blue schemes . in particular , we will see that the notions of usual morphisms and tits morphisms coincide on the common subcategories of semiring schemes and blue schemes of pure rank .    in section [ section :",
    "tits monoids ] , we introduce the notions of a _ tits monoid _ and of _ tits - weyl models_. after recalling basic definitions and facts on groups and monoids in _ cartesian categories _ in section [ subsection : reminder on cartesian categories ] , we show in section [ subsection : sch_t is cartesian ] that the tits category as well as some other categories and functors between them are cartesian . in section [",
    "subsection : tits - weyl models ] , we are finally prepared to define a tits monoid as a monoid in @xmath29 and a tits - weyl model of a group scheme @xmath2 as a tits monoid with certain additional properties as described before . as first applications ,",
    "we establish constant group schemes and tori as tits monoids in @xmath105 in section [ subsection : tits - weyl models of pure rank ] .",
    "tori and certain semi - direct products of tori by constant group schemes , as they occur as normalizers of maximal tori in chevalley groups , have tits - weyl models in @xmath105 .    in section [ section :",
    "tits - weyl models of chevalley groups ] , we establish tits - weyl models for a wide range of chevalley groups . as a first step ,",
    "we introduce the tits - weyl model @xmath106 of the special linear group in section [ subsection : special linear group ] .",
    "all other tits - weyl models of chevalley groups will be realized by an embedding of the chevalley group into a special linear group . in order to do so",
    ", we will frequently use an argument , which we call the _ cube lemma _",
    ", to descend morphisms . in section [",
    "subsection : closed subgroups of tits - weyl models ] , we prove the core result theorem [ thm : tits - weyl models of subgroups ] , which provides a tits - weyl model for subgroups of a group scheme with a tits - weyl model under a certain hypothesis on the position of a maximal torus and its normalizer in the subgroup . we apply this to describe the tits - weyl model of general linear groups , symplectic groups and special orthogonal groups and some of their isogenies like adjoint chevalley groups of type @xmath107 and orthogonal groups of type @xmath90 . in section [ subsection : adjoint chevalley groups ] , we describe tits - weyl models of chevalley groups of adjoint type that come from the adjoint representation of the chevalley group on its lie algebra .",
    "this requires a different strategy from the cases before and is based on formulas for the adjoint action over algebraically closed fields .    in section [ section : tits - weyl models of subgroups ]",
    ", we draw further conclusions from theorem [ thm : tits - weyl models of subgroups ] . if @xmath2 is a chevalley group with a tits weyl model , then certain parabolic subgroups of @xmath2 and their levi subgroups have tits - weyl models .",
    "we comment on unipotent radicals , but the problem of tits - weyl models of their unipotent radicals stays open .",
    "we conclude the paper with appendix [ app : examples ] , which contains examples of non - standard tits - weyl models of tori and explicit calculations for three tits - weyl models of type @xmath98 .",
    "in this first part of the paper , we establish several general results on blue schemes that we will need to introduce the tits category and tits - weyl models .      to start with",
    ", we will establish certain notations and conventions used throughout the paper .",
    "we assume in general that the reader is familiar with the first part @xcite of this work .",
    "occasionally , we will repeat facts if it eases the understanding , or if a presentation in a different shape is useful . for the purposes of this paper , we will , however , slightly alter notations from @xcite as explained in the following .",
    "the most important convention  which might lead to confusion if not noticed  is that we change a definition of the preceding paper @xcite , in which we introduced blueprints and blue schemes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ whenever we refer to a blueprint or a blue scheme in this paper , we understand that it is proper and with @xmath108 .",

    "<S> this paper is dedicated to a problem raised by jacquet tits in 1956 : the weyl group of a chevalley group should find an interpretation as a group over what is nowadays called @xmath0 , _ the field with one element_. based on part i of the geometry of blueprints , we introduce the class of _ tits morphisms _ between blue schemes . the resulting _ tits category _ </S>",

    "<S> we prove for @xmath2 in a wide class of chevalley groups  which includes the special and general linear groups , symplectic and special orthogonal groups , and all types of adjoint groups  that a linear representation of @xmath2 defines a model @xmath3 in @xmath1 whose weyl extension is the weyl group @xmath4 of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we call such models _ tits - weyl models_. the potential of tits - weyl models lies in _ ( a ) _ their intrinsic definition that is given by a linear representation ; _ ( b ) _ the ( yet to be formulated ) unified approach towards thick and thin geometries ; and _ ( c ) _ the extension of a chevalley group to a functor on blueprints , which makes it , in particular , possible to consider chevalley groups over semirings </S>",
