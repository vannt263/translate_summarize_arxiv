    "let @xmath0 be the dimension and let @xmath1 be a domain ( open , connected ) with a non - empty compact lipschitz boundary ( @xmath2 ) . for given @xmath3 , we shall consider the following hele - shaw - type problem on a parabolic cylinder @xmath4 $ ] for some @xmath5 : find @xmath6 that formally satisfies @xmath7 with some boundary data to be specified later ( theorem  [ th : well - posedness ] ) ,    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the gradient and the laplace operator in the @xmath10 variable , and @xmath11 is the normal velocity of the _ free boundary _ @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that the solution is sufficiently smooth , the free boundary @xmath12 is a level set of @xmath13 and its normal velocity can be expressed as @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 formally represent the limits of the derivatives from the positive set of @xmath13 .",
    "the well - posedness of problem requires some basic regularity of @xmath17 . in the following",
    "we shall assume that @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 for some positive constants @xmath19 , and that @xmath17 is @xmath20-lipschitz both in @xmath10 and @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22    we are interested in the behavior of the solutions of in the _ homogenization limit _ @xmath23 .",
    "since we want to observe an averaging behavior , we further assume that @xmath17 is a @xmath24-periodic function , i.e. , @xmath25 in the following we define @xmath26 note that @xmath27 is an @xmath28-periodic @xmath29-lipschitz function which satisfies .",
    "problem with @xmath30 is the standard hele - shaw problem with no surface tension . in two dimensions ,",
    "it was introduced in @xcite as a model of a slow movement of a viscous fluid injected in between two nearby parallel plates that form the so - called hele - shaw cell .",
    "this problem naturally generalizes to all dimensions @xmath31 . in particular , in three dimensions it serves as a model of a pressure - driven flow of an incompressible fluid through a porous medium . following this motivation , problem with general @xmath17 describes a pressure - driven flow of an incompressible fluid in an inhomogeneous , time - dependent medium .",
    "free boundary problems with similar velocity laws have various applications in the plastics industry and other fields @xcite .",
    "the hele - shaw - type problem can also be viewed as a quasi - stationary limit of the one - phase stefan problem with a latent heat of phase transition depending on position and time @xcite .",
    "there is a large amount of literature on homogenization which is beyond the scope of this discussion and thus we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .    in the context of viscosity solutions for fully nonlinear problems of the first and second order ,",
    "the now standard approach to homogenization using correctors that are the solutions of an appropriate cell problem was pioneered by lions , papanicolau & varadhan @xcite for first order equations , and later by evans @xcite for second order equations .",
    "unfortunately , this approach does not apply to problems like because the zero level of solutions has a special significance and the perturbation of a test function by a global periodic solution of some cell problem , i.e. , the corrector , does not seem feasible .    the idea of using obstacle problems to recover the homogenized operator without the need for a cell problem was developed by caffarelli , souganidis & wang @xcite for the stochastic homogenization of fully - nonlinear second order elliptic equations .",
    "it was then applied to the homogenization of the hele - shaw problem with spatial periodic inhomogeneity by kim @xcite , using purely the methods of the theory of viscosity solutions .",
    "this approach was later extended to a model of contact angle dynamics @xcite , and an algebraic rate of the convergence of free boundaries was obtained @xcite .",
    "kim & mellet @xcite later succeeded at applying a combination of viscosity and variational approaches and obtained a homogenization result in the setting of spatial stationary ergodic random media .",
    "a related question of long - time asymptotics of the spatially inhomogeneous hele - shaw problem was addressed by the author @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on the special structure of problem with time - independent @xmath17 which allows us to rewrite the problem as a variational inequality of a certain obstacle problem .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for an exposition of obstacle problems and their homogenization .",
    "the homogenization results for spatial media do not necessarily translate directly to the spatiotemporal homogenization . in the context of hamilton - jacobi equations , for instance , a lack of uniform estimates in the spatiotemporal case",
    "was encountered by schwab @xcite who proved the homogenization in spatiotemporal stationary ergodic random media , which was before established by souganidis @xcite for spatial random media .",
    "the situation seems to be more extreme in the case of the hele - shaw problem since the homogenization in spatiotemporal media is qualitatively different even in the periodic case .",
    "this difference can be already observed in the homogenization of a single ordinary differential equation of the type @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , the hele - shaw problem reduces to this type of ode in one dimension ; see section  [ sec : homogenizationin1d ] for further discussion .",
    "it is known that , under some assumptions on @xmath33 , @xmath34 locally uniformly , where @xmath35 is the solution of a homogenized ode @xcite . however , the form of the homogenized problem depends on @xmath33 .",
    "if , for illustration , @xmath36 is a @xmath37-periodic lipschitz function , then the homogenized problem has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the constant @xmath40 on the other hand , if @xmath41 has a nontrivial dependence on both @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then no such explicit formula exists and , in fact , the right - hand side of the homogenized problem , while still a constant , can possibly attain any value in the range @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "another explanation of the qualitative difference , slightly more intuitive , is the interpretation of the hele - shaw problem as the quasi - stationary limit of the stefan problem .",
    "then the quantity @xmath45 can be interpreted as the _ latent heat of phase transition _ , that is , the `` energy '' necessary to change a unit volume of the dry region into the wet region and advance the free boundary @xcite .",
    "the `` energy flux '' is proportional to the gradient of the pressure .",
    "if @xmath17 does not depend on time , the homogenized latent heat is simply the average , i.e. , @xmath46^n } ( g(x))^{-1 } { \\;dx}$ ] , giving the homogenized velocity recovered in @xcite ( of the form ) .",
    "this formula was rigorously justified in @xcite using the variational formulation via an obstacle problem , which allows one to solve for the shape of the wet region at a given time without the need to solve the problem at previous times .",
    "the variational formulation was introduced in @xcite using a transformation due to @xcite . in a sense , for the evolution",
    "overall , the free boundary feels the same influence of the medium no matter how it passes through it . or , in other words , the amount of the energy required to fill a given region is always the same .",
    "this drastically changes when the latent heat depends on both space and time . in this case , the energy required to advance the boundary depends on the specific history of the motion of the free boundary through the space - time .",
    "the variational formulation does not apply anymore .",
    "what is more , it is no longer obvious that the problem should homogenize . as the one - dimensional situation indicates",
    " section  [ sec : homogenizationin1d]the homogenized velocity might have a complicated dependence on the gradient , with velocity pinning and directional dependence .",
    "some of these features appear in the spatial homogenization of non - monotone problems @xcite .",
    "our approach can be characterized as geometric , relying on maximum principle arguments .",
    "a similar approach to homogenization , albeit of ( local ) geometric motions , was recently pursued by caffarelli & monneau @xcite .",
    "the geometric approach to the hele - shaw problem is complicated by the nonlocal nature of the problem .",
    "indeed , can be interpreted as a geometric motion of the free boundary with the velocity given by a nonlocal operator based on the dirichlet - to - neumann map .",
    "thus the domain is of crucial importance .",
    "we present new well - posedness and homogenization results for the hele - shaw - type problem .",
    "the well - posedness result is a generalization and an improvement of the previous results in @xcite . in full generality",
    ", we consider the hele - shaw type problem @xmath47 let us introduce a number of assumptions on the function @xmath48 . in the following , we use the semi - continuous envelopes @xmath49 and @xmath50 of @xmath33 on @xmath51 ( see for definition ) .",
    "let us point out that we do not require continuity of @xmath52 in @xmath53 .",
    "we shall need this generality to handle the homogenized problem .    1 .",

    "2 .   ( lipschitz continuity ) there exists a constant @xmath58 such that @xmath33 is @xmath20-lipschitz in @xmath10 and @xmath21 for all @xmath53 .",
    "3 .   ( monotonicity ) @xmath59 for any @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the assumption ( a3 ) implies that the free boundary velocity is monotone with respect to the gradient , while allowing for certain jumps .",
    "we have the following well - posedness theorem for viscosity solutions that are introduced in section  [ sec : viscosity - solutions ] .",
    "[ th : well - posedness ] let @xmath62 $ ] where @xmath63 is a domain that satisfies the assumptions above and @xmath5 .",

    "the solution is unique in the sense that @xmath80 and @xmath81 for any two viscosity solutions @xmath13 , @xmath82 with the given boundary data .",
    "in the context of a flow in porous media , @xmath83 represents the source of a liquid with the prescribed pressure @xmath84 on its boundary , and @xmath85 is the initial wet region . the situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : setting ] .    however",
    ", the main result of this paper concerns the homogenization of . note that because the solution of the homogenized problem might be discontinuous , we can not expect uniform convergence of solutions in general .",
    "furthermore , we do not know if the homogenized velocity ( @xmath86 in theorem  [ th : intro - homogenization ] below ) is continuous .",

    "let us give an overview of the main ideas in the paper . since the variational formulation via an obstacle problem , discussed above ,",
    "is not available , we have to rely solely on the technically heavy tools of the viscosity theory .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath17 poses significant new challenges which require a rather nontrivial extension of the previous results .",
    "the first step is the identification of the homogenized problem . since the solutions of are harmonic in space in their positive sets on any scale @xmath100 , their limit as @xmath101 should also be harmonic in space .",
    "the free boundary velocity of the homogenized problem is , however , unknown . following the ideas from @xcite ,",
    "we identify the correct homogenized free boundary velocity by solving an obstacle problem and study its behavior as @xmath93 . to motivate our approach , suppose that the solutions @xmath92 in the limit @xmath101 converge to a solution @xmath13 of the homogenized hele - shaw problem with the free boundary law given as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an increasing function on @xmath104 for any @xmath105 .",
    "the crucial observation is that this problem has traveling wave solutions ; these are the planar solutions of the form @xmath106 , with the particular choice @xmath107 . here",
    "@xmath108 stands for the positive part , i.e. , @xmath109 . if @xmath110 then @xmath111 is a supersolution of the homogenized problem , and if @xmath112 it is a subsolution .",
    "this observation allows us to identify the correct velocity @xmath113 by solving the @xmath100-problem for each @xmath3 and comparing the solution with the planar solution @xmath111 for given @xmath86 and @xmath114 . loosely speaking ,",
    "if @xmath86 is too large for a given @xmath114 , the solutions @xmath92 should evolve slower than @xmath111 for small @xmath100 and , similarly , if @xmath86 is too small then @xmath92 should evolve faster than @xmath111 for small @xmath100 .",
    "to make this idea rigorous , we solve the following obstacle problems for each fixed @xmath100 : given a fixed domain @xmath90 , @xmath86 and @xmath114 , find the largest subsolution @xmath115 of the @xmath100-problem that stays under @xmath111 in @xmath90 and the smallest supersolution @xmath116 of the @xmath100-problem that stays above @xmath111 in @xmath90 .",
    "following this reasoning , we find two candidates for the correct homogenized velocity @xmath113 by `` properly measuring '' how much contact there is as @xmath101 between the obstacle @xmath111 and the largest subsolution @xmath115 , yielding @xmath117 , and the smallest supersolution @xmath116 , yielding @xmath118 .",
    "since the free boundary velocity law is nonlocal , given by a dirichlet - to - neumann map , a good choice of the domain @xmath90 for this procedure is important .    for homogenization to occur ,",
    "it is necessary that both candidates @xmath117 and @xmath118 yield the same limit problem .",
    "we need to give a proper meaning to the intuitive idea of evolving slower or faster than the obstacle @xmath119 .",
    "the selection of a quantity that not only `` properly measures '' the amount of contact between the obstacle @xmath111 and the solutions of the obstacle problem in the homogenization limit @xmath93 but is also convenient to work with is far from obvious . in particular , we want to take advantage of the natural monotonicity ( birkhoff property ) of the solutions of the obstacle problem , which is a consequence of the periodicity of the medium .    in @xcite as well as in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the coincidence set of the solutions of the obstacle problem and the obstacle @xmath111 as their quantity of choice .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that if there is a contact on a sufficiently large set , then the solution must be close to the obstacle everywhere .",
    "this kind of estimate can be established using the alexandroff - bakelman - pucci estimate in the case of fully nonlinear elliptic problems in @xcite . since abp - type estimates are not available for the hele - shaw problem , the closeness to the obstacle must be derived by other means @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach in the context of free boundary problems , in particular for the homogenization of , stems from the restriction that it imposes on the directions in which one can translate the solutions of the obstacle problem to take advantage of their natural monotonicity property , and to recover the monotonicity of the contact set .",
    "this creates technical difficulties and requires a separate treatment of rational and irrational directions .",
    "it seems that , to overcome these difficulties , it is necessary to scale the solutions in time for the arguments to work .",
    "however , a scaling in time is not available in the time - dependent medium .",
    "the main new idea in this paper is the introduction of _ flatness _ and its critical value @xmath120 ( section  [ sec : flatness ] ) .",
    "more specifically , to recover the correct homogenized boundary velocity for a given gradient @xmath114 we test if , for some fixed @xmath121 , the free boundary of the solution of the obstacle problem stays @xmath120-close to the obstacle for a unit time on an arbitrary small scale @xmath100 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the new cone flatness property ( proposition  [ pr : cone - flatness ] ) : the boundary of the solution of the obstacle problem stays between two cones that are @xmath122 apart .",
    "therefore if , for @xmath123 , the boundary is farther than @xmath124 , it will be detached from the obstacle on a large set .",
    "this is formulated in the _ detachment lemma _",
    "( lemma  [ le : detachment - ball ] ) .",
    "moreover , the improvement of the _ local comparison principle _ ( theorem  [ th : localcomparison ] ) for @xmath120-flat solutions to allow for @xmath125 is a necessary ingredient to close the argument .",
    "this approach allows us to prove that the candidates @xmath117 and @xmath118 almost coincide , i.e. , @xmath126 , and that @xmath127 satisfies the assumptions ( a1)(a3 ) .",
    "moreover , if the medium is time - independent , that is , @xmath128 , we are able to show that @xmath129 are continuous and one - homogeneous ( section  [ sec : time - independent ] ) , essentially recovering the result of @xcite .",
    "once the homogenized velocity has been identified , we can prove that the half - relaxed limits satisfy the homogenized problem ( section  [ sec : convergence ] ) .",
    "the perturbed test function method can not be applied to free boundary problems and a different , more geometric argument based on a comparison of the solutions of the @xmath100-problem with rescaled translations of the solutions of the obstacle problems must be engaged .",
    "the detachment lemma ( lemma  [ le : detachment - ball ] ) plays a key role in this argument .",
    "finally , since the comparison with barriers guarantees that the limits have the correct boundary data , the comparison principle for the limit problem establishes that the upper and lower half - relaxed limits coincide with the unique solution of the homogenized problem .",
    "let us conclude the introduction by mentioning some of the open problems .",
    "we have been only able to show that the homogenized velocity @xmath86 is semi - continuous .",
    "however , it seems quite reasonable to expect continuity , or even hlder continuity . as the one - dimensional case suggests in section  [ sec : homogenizationin1d ] , this is the highest regularity one may hope for in a general situation .",
    "another open problem is the question of a convergence rate of free boundaries in the homogenization limit .",
    "an algebraic rate was obtained in the periodic spatial homogenization case @xcite .",
    "these issues will be addressed in future work .",
    "a related open problem is the homogenization in random media when the free boundary problem does not have a variational structure , unlike @xcite .",
    "this problem has not yet been solved since there is no obvious subadditive quantity to which the subadditive ergodic theorem can be applied to overcome the lack of compactness of a general probability space .",
    "finally , in the current paper , we use the monotone propagation property of the free boundary  that is , that the wet region can not recede  to obtain some of the important estimates .",
    "the presented method , however , seems robust enough to handle non - monotone problems such as the model of contact angle dynamics as in @xcite .",
    "this will also be a subject of future work .",
    "the exposition of the proof of the homogenization result was split in a number of steps .",
    "first we give the necessary definitions of solutions in section  [ sec : viscosity - solutions ] , together with some preliminary results including the comparison principle and a well - posedness result .",
    "these are used in section  [ sec : limit - problem ] , where we identify a candidate for the limit velocity . finally , section  [ sec : convergence ]",
    "is devoted to showing that the solutions converge in the homogenization limit .",
    "in addition , the appendices contain some auxiliary results used throughout the text .",
    "in this section , we briefly revisit the theory of viscosity solutions of the hele - shaw problem .",
    "we generalize the definitions introduced in @xcite , and outline the proof of the comparison principle in our settings , section  [ sec : comparison - principle ] , with an aim at establishing theorem  [ th : well - posedness ] in section  [ sec : well - posedness ] .",
    "let us mention that viscosity solutions seem to be the natural class of solutions of since the problem has a maximum principle structure .",
    "moreover , due to the possible topological changes and merging of free boundaries , the solutions might be discontinuous @xcite .",
    "the standard notion of solutions due to @xcite does not apply when @xmath17 in depends on time .",
    "since viscosity solutions are the only weak notion of solutions used throughout the paper , we will often refer to them simply as _",

    "they are introduced in section  [ sec : obstacle - problem ] , where for each scale @xmath548 , gradient @xmath114 and candidate @xmath86 of the free boundary velocity we set up a domain , an obstacle and define a subsolution and a supersolution of an obstacle problem .",
    "the main feature of the solutions of the obstacle problems is their natural monotonicity with respect to a family of scalings and translations , section  [ sec : monotonicity - obstacle ] . to quantify the viability of the homogenization velocity candidate",
    ", we introduce a new quantity , called _ flatness _ , in section  [ sec : flatness ] , and derive its basic properties .",
    "it measures how far the obstacle problem solutions detach from the obstacle , that is , how `` flat '' they are .",
    "the following three sections then cover three important results that build on the definitions above .",
    "first , the _ local comparison principle _ , section  [ sec : local - comparison - principle ] , improves on the theorem of the same name from @xcite , and allows us to locally compare the subsolutions of the obstacle problems with the supersolutions , away from the domain boundary , even after the boundary values are no longer ordered , provided that the flatness of those solutions is bounded with a certain rate .",
    "section  [ sec : cone - flatness ] then presents the new _ cone flatness _ property , which is a consequence of our particular choice of the domain for the obstacle problems , and which guarantees that the free boundary of a given obstacle problem solution lies in between two nearby cones",
    "whose distance can be estimated .",
    "finally , the _ detachment lemma _ of section  [ sec : detachment ] , a direct consequence of the cone flatness property , guarantees that if the flatness of a given obstacle problem solution exceeds a certain value , the solution is separated from a significant portion of the obstacle .",
    "these three results motivate the introduction of the two candidates for the homogenized velocity in section  [ sec : homogenized - velocity ] .",
    "we then deduce the semi - continuity of the candidates and their coincidence up to the points of discontinuity , as explained in section  [ sec : semi - continuity ] .",
    "the main tools are the natural monotonicity of the obstacle problem , the local comparison principle and the detachment lemma . in section  [ sec : time - independent ] we make a brief detour to show that if the scaling in time is available , as is the case in the time - independent medium , we can prove that the homogenized velocity is in fact continuous and positively one - homogeneous , which recovers the results of @xcite via our methods .",
    "let us first explore the homogenization of in one dimension . for simplicity , we take @xmath549 and @xmath550 for some @xmath551 . furthermore , let @xmath552 $ ] be a positive , @xmath20-lipschitz , @xmath553-periodic function .",

    "moreover , the harmonic function @xmath562 must be linear on @xmath563 with the slope @xmath564 .",
    "therefore , for every fixed @xmath3 , the free boundary condition in is equivalent to a simple ode of the form @xmath565 due to the ode homogenization result of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath566 locally uniformly , where @xmath558 is the solution of @xmath567 the arguments in this paper then imply that @xmath33 is of the form @xmath568 the function @xmath113 can be found numerically by scaling and thus solving @xmath569 in some @xmath570 $ ] for @xmath571 large . then @xmath113 can be approximated by @xmath572 .",

    "the domain of the obstacle problem , @xmath585 , requires a special attention .",

    "the homogenized hele - shaw problem with boundary velocity law @xmath586 admits simple traveling wave solutions .",
    "we call them planar solutions since each is a positive part of a linear function with gradient @xmath587 moving in the direction @xmath588 with the normal velocity @xmath589 .",
    "these solutions serve as the obstacles for the obstacle problem that will be used to find a candidate of the homogenized free boundary velocity @xmath113 .    for any @xmath587 and @xmath331",

    "it is achieved by a comparison with the class of planar subsolutions and supersolutions @xmath601 constructed below .",
