    "experiments using optical and microwave cavities have provided a useful testing ground for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for demonstrating basic principles of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental consequences of the linearity of quantum mechanics is the no - cloning theorem @xcite , which states that it is impossible to perfectly copy an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "however , approximate copying is possible , and universal optimal quantum cloning devices have been proposed which produce the best possible copies of an arbitrary quantum state @xcite .",
    "simon and coworkers have proposed @xcite a scheme to implement optimal quantum cloning in a simple natural way using atoms and a cavity .",
    "simon _ et al _ s scheme utilizes stimulated emission from atoms in a high finesse cavity , where the quantum bits are represented in the state of the two polarization modes of the cavity .",
    "excited atoms with lambda energy level configurations are passed through the cavity where they emit photons via both stimulated emission and spontaneous emission .",
    "the net result of these two processes is that the photons produced are copies of the original photons , due to the stimulated emission , but are noisy , due to the spontaneous emission .",
    "simon and coworkers showed that such a process can in fact generate states in the cavity which represent optimal clones of the initial cavity state .",
    "however , represented in the state of the cavity , the clones are not spatially separate two - level subsystems , and can therefore be neither individually addressed nor measured , which restricts their usefulness .",
    "a suggestion is made in @xcite to separate these qubits into polarization states of individual photons by using an array of beamsplitters .",
    "this , however , is not an appealing practical proposal for several reasons . to ensure a low probability of finding more than a single photon in each output mode",
    ", one would need to use a large number of beamsplitters and many more output modes than the number of cloned photons .",
    "each beamsplitter will introduce some noise to the photonic qubits , reducing the fidelity of the clones , and , in order to localize the photons , one would need to perform a polarization - independent non - demolition measurement of the number of photons in each output mode .    in this paper",
    "we propose two simpler schemes which allow the qubits represented in the cavity state to be transferred coherently onto spatially separated qubits , which are represented in the energy levels of single atoms .",
    "this process could then be immediately applied to the cavity states produced in simon _",
    "et al _ s cloning scheme .",

    "in this section we will describe two related schemes to transfer qubits represented by a cavity state onto atoms .",
    "this first scheme is deterministic , i.e. , every atom which passes through the cavity , will , upon leaving the cavity , have absorbed a photon and had a qubit transferred onto it .",
    "the second scheme , on the other hand , depends on the outcome of projective energy measurements on the atoms once they have left the cavity , the successful transfer of a qubit onto the atom occurs , then , in general , with less than unit probability , so this scheme is non - deterministic .",
    "first , however , we will briefly discuss the way in which symmetric multi - qubit states can be represented in atoms and a two - mode cavity .",
    "a symmetric multi - qubit state is a state which is invariant under the interchange of any two qubits .",

    "these states are defined and discussed further in the appendix .",
    "consider a cavity with two modes of orthogonal polarization , which we shall label @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "quantum states of the cavity can be expressed in the fock - basis of the two modes .",
    "if the total number of photons in the cavity is definite , there is a natural correspondence between @xmath3-photon cavity states and symmetric @xmath3-qubit states .",
    "let us consider the cavity fock state @xmath10 , the state where modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 contain @xmath6 and @xmath11 photons respectively , as representing the @xmath3-qubit symmetric state @xmath4 .",
    "since all basis states of the symmetric @xmath3-qubit subspace can be represented , any arbitrary symmetric @xmath3-qubit state can be represented in the cavity .",
    "additionally , qubits can be represented in the energy levels of atoms . in this paper , we consider three - level atoms with a v - configuration of energy levels , that is , with two degenerate excited states and a single ground state , as illustrated in figure [ vatomfig ] .",
    "we will use the excited subspace of the atoms to represent qubits , and thus label the excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 to make this clear .",
    "the ground state is labeled @xmath2 .",
    "we will thus consider the atom to be representing a qubit only when its state is wholly within this excited subspace .    in the appendix , in equation , a decomposition of a general symmetric state in terms of symmetric states on qubit subsets is presented .",
    "this means that symmetric states can be represented in a system consisting of a two - mode cavity and a number of atoms , such that each atom carries a qubit and the remainder are represented in the cavity .",

    "the principle of the deterministic scheme is very simple .",
    "atoms , with a v - configuration of energy levels , are passed , in their ground state , through the cavity , one at a time , such that each remains in the cavity for a half integer number of rabi - oscillations .",
    "the atoms will emerge from the cavity in an excited state , and the quantum state of the whole system still represents the same @xmath3-qubit symmetric state as the initial cavity state , but now , with one of the qubits represented in the excited subspace of the atom .    while in the cavity field the atoms interact with the cavity modes according to the following interaction hamiltonian .",

    "for example , the states created by simon _ et al _ s general cloning scheme are mixtures of states representing different numbers of optimally cloned qubits .",
    "a non demolition measurement of the total number of photons in the cavity or a measurement of the energies of the atoms used in the cloning process will project the cavity state into one of these states .",

    "this allows one of the inconvenient aspects of the deterministic scheme to be avoided , namely the need to have a different interaction time for each atom passing through the cavity , with the trade off that the qubit transfer will not be successful each time .",

    "this is not actually a quantum state of the system , but describes the situation when the interaction time between atom and cavity is very close to a multiple of the interaction s rabi period .",

    "although this seems rather counterintuitive , this can be explained by remembering that the fidelity is a property of an ensemble of systems , and thus reflects an average of the possible final fidelities , which can indeed be higher than the actual final fidelity .    in the limit of large numbers of repetitions ,",
    "as long as trapping states have been avoided , one term of the original mixture of different numbers of clones will become entirely dominant , and the weights of other terms will become vanishingly small .",

    "the projective measurement of the atomic energies could be implemented using quantum jump detection techniques @xcite .",
    "this would provide a high detection efficiency and would not destroy the qubit state in the measurement process .",
    "after the atoms have left the cavity , they will still be traveling at high velocity , and it would be difficult to cool and trap them without destroying the qubit state . if , however , a stationary qubit is needed , the atom can be passed through a further cavity of the same dimensions , in its vacuum state .",
    "if the atom interacts with the cavity for half the rabi oscillation period , the qubit is mapped onto the cavity , where it is represented in the ( @xmath124,@xmath125 ) basis , in a similar way to the `` quantum memory '' scheme implemented in @xcite .",
    "the identification between the states of a two - mode cavity states and symmetric qubit states is natural , but the chosen correspondence between the fock basis states and the symmetric basis states is not the only one one could make , and could be considered to be an arbitrary choice .",
    "these schemes give a concrete physical justification for this choice .",
