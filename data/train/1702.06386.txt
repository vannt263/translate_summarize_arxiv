    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite suggests that certain conformal field theories ( cfts ) can be holographically dual to gravity theories with asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence can hence be used as a tool to gain understanding of various field theory phenomena , usually at strong coupling , by phrasing the problem at hand in terms of the dual gravitational theory . amongst many other things , topics to which ads / cft methods have been applied in the past were rg flows ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , holographic superconductors @xcite and _ boundary cfts ( bcfts ) _ , see @xcite for a cursory overview over different types of ads / bcft models proposed in the literature .    in descriptions of the ads / cft correspondence",
    ", one will often encounter the term _ holographic dictionary _ , describing the idea of a , real or imagined , list of quantities defined either on the bulk ( ads ) or field theory ( cft ) side that are mapped to each other via the correspondence .",
    "an example of a well - known entry into this dictionary is the holographic _ entanglement entropy _",
    "formula @xcite @xmath1 where the entanglement entropy @xmath2 of a certain subregion is a cft quantity , while @xmath3 is the ( bulk ) newton constant and @xmath4 is the area of an extremal co - dimension two surface in the bulk ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "recently , there were two independent proposals for what might be the field theory dual to the volumes of certain extremal co - dimension _ one _ hypersurfaces .",
    "firstly , ideas relating to _ computational complexity _ seem to have entered holography in discussions concerning the _ firewall paradox _ @xcite in the works @xcite , where a connection between complexity and bulk geometry was envisioned .",
    "following @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we will define _ computational complexity _ as the minimal number of simple unitary operations that have to be carried out by a quantum computer in order to implement a given unitary operation on a simple initial state , or to create a given state from a simple initial state .",
    "based on the findings of @xcite , it was then suggested in @xcite that holographically , the complexity @xmath5 of the field theory state should be measured by the volumes @xmath6 of certain spacelike extremal co - dimension one bulk hypersurfaces , i.e. has to be introduced into equation , which leads to a certain arbitrariness in the choice of the scale in this definition . in the following , we will use equation with @xmath7 being the ads radius as the definition of complexity , assuming an order one factor of proportionality between the left and right hand side . ]",
    "@xmath8 it was later argued in @xcite that the computational complexity @xmath5 should more accurately be calculated from the integral of the bulk action over a certain ( co - dimension zero ) bulk region , the wheeler - dewitt patch .",

    "secondly , in @xcite it was proposed that the volume @xmath6 of an extremal spacelike co - dimension one hypersurface should be approximately dual to a quantity @xmath9 called _ quantum information metric _ or _ fidelity susceptibility _ according to the formula @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an order one factor , @xmath7 is the ads radius and @xmath12 determines the dimension such that the ads space is @xmath13 dimensional . for two normalised states @xmath14 and",

    "the correct bulk spacetime dual to this field theory problem is a so called _ janus solution _ , but in @xcite it was shown that this geometry may be approximated by a simpler spacetime with a probe defect brane embedded into it .",

    "it was quickly realised that the phenomenon had to be due to the interaction of conduction electrons with the localised single magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "a perturbative second order calculation by jun kondo in @xcite then explained the rise of the resistivity at low temperatures as a consequence of the spin - spin interaction between impurities and electrons , but also predicted an unphysical _ divergence _ of the resistivity in the zero temperature limit .",

    "the meaning of this cs field for the interpretation of the model - is elaborated upon in @xcite , however as this field effectively decouples from the other fields @xcite , and as in this work we are more interested in this model as a generic well - behaved toy model of the class than as a concrete kondo model , we will ignore this field from now on .",
    "the fields on the hypersurface @xmath30 constitute something similar to a holographic superconductor in @xmath65 , with the gauge group of the @xmath66 field chosen to be @xmath67 .",

    "such constant tension models are especially important in ads / bcft as they can be solved analytically in many cases and describe rg fixed points , see @xcite . expanding near the boundary , we find @xmath80    of course , there are also non - trivial solutions with @xmath81 . in this case , the asymptotic expansion of @xmath82 will still take the form @xmath83 where we fix @xmath84 and let the chemical potential @xmath85 vary .",
    "this leads to a very important point : as said above , we use the metric with @xmath70 .",

    "fixing @xmath87 and increasing @xmath85 is hence physically equivalent to keeping @xmath85 fixed and decreasing the temperature @xmath25 .",
    "this is similar to the situation in holographic superconductors @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will mostly think about the kondo model in terms of a temperature being lowered for fixed @xmath85 , as this is the more realistic viewpoint when comparing to experimental studies of the kondo effect .",
    "from now on , we will leave the tildes away on all quantities .    increasing @xmath85 above the value @xmath92 defined in , respectively lowering @xmath25 below a critical temperature @xmath93 , we find that the scalar field @xmath94 in the bulk condenses , and obtains an asymptotic expansion ( gauge - fixing @xmath95 ) @xcite @xmath96 where , due to some peculiarities of the holographic kondo model explained in detail in @xcite , the appropriate boundary conditions are of the _ double trace _ type @xcite @xmath97 with the _ kondo coupling _ @xmath98 .",
    "qualitatively , the kondo model is similar to a holographic superconductor @xcite : at @xmath99 , the normal phase described above becomes instable , and at @xmath100 the charged scalar field attains a non - vanishing profile , the _ condensed _ or _ broken phase_. holographically , this is interpreted as the formation of the _ kondo cloud _ in the field theory side @xcite .",
    "the holographic kondo model hence describes the kondo effect in terms of a phase transition . due to the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem ,",
    "this is possible for the real world kondo effect only in the large @xmath27 limit , where @xmath101 is the spin - group of the magnetic impurity @xcite . ]",
    "lowering @xmath102 ( or equivalently increasing @xmath85 ) , the kondo model then experiences an rg flow from the uv fixed point described by the constant tension solution - towards an ir fixed point @xcite .",
    "irrespectively of whether the model presented in this section is an accurate _",
    "kondo _ model ( see @xcite for discussions of this question ) , it is important to point out that , in its own right , this model is a very interesting ads / bcft toy model following the proposal of @xcite .",
    "the reasons for that are as follows :    * the model is non - trivial , i.e.  it has non - trivial matter content @xmath103 , in contrast to the simpler constant tension models . *",
    "the model is well - behaved , in the sense that the matter fields @xmath40 satisfy ( or violate ) different energy - conditions just in such a way as is phenomenologically necessary for a holographic kondo model @xcite .",
    "* the model is qualitatively well - understood , as the various energy conditions constrain the possible geometries @xcite . *",
    "the model nicely displays a physical boundary rg flow . as we will discuss in section [ sec::simp ] , it is for example possible to explicitly calculate the _ boundary entropy _ and verify that the affleck - ludwig @xmath0-theorem is satisfied .    as the proposals and suggest that certain bulk volumes will have an interesting physical interpretation in terms of field theory quantities , we will in the next section calculate the loss of volume that occurs in the holographic kondo model along the rg flow .",
    "in @xcite , we numerically obtained the embedding profiles @xmath54 solving in the kondo model - with the effective parameter - choices @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these choices are slightly different from the original incarnation of the holographic kondo model @xcite , but they allow for non - trivial backreaction and stable numerics .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite we argued that the geometry of the backreacted solutions is strongly constrained by the energy conditions satisfied or violated by the model , hence the precise values of @xmath106 will not matter for the qualitative features of the model , and the above choice gives representative results . in any case , as argued above the model under consideration can serve as an interesting non - trivial ads@xmath22/bcft@xmath23 toy model .",
    "the numerical results for the embeddings @xmath54 of @xmath30 into @xmath27 are shown in figure [ fig::backreaction ] .",
    "as explained in section [ sec::kondomodel ] , in our numerics we make a coordinate choice that effectively keeps the event horizon radius @xmath107 constant , so that it is strictly speaking @xmath85 that is varied .",
    "this has the benefit that the bulk spacetime @xmath27 , given by the metric , stays the same .",
    "the effect of the backreaction is then that as we follow the rg flow , the brane @xmath30 starts at its constant tension uv configuration and sweeps to the right over the fixed bulk spacetime like a curtain .",
    "it is hence immediately visible that the bulk spacetime will loose volume along the rg flow , in fact , we can in this setup directly identify specific bulk points that will be lost and determine the temperature @xmath102 at which this will happen .",
    "> 018inkscape -z -d file = embeddingturn_latexed.svg export - pdf = embeddingturn_latexed.pdf export - latex    interestingly , we also see that for @xmath108 all the curves in figure [ fig::backreaction ] approach the boundary with the same slope .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that the scalar field @xmath109 falls off towards the boundary , hence near the boundary the curves @xmath54 will increasingly resemble the solution for the critical temperature where @xmath110 everywhere . in rg flow parlance ,",
    "if we interpret the near boundary region of the spacetime as uv region , it is clear that all curves along the rg flow should be similar in this region , as they were all derived by following the rg flow from the same uv fixed point .",
    "the consequence of this similarity of the embedding curves near the boundary is that when calculating the loss of volume for a certain point along the rg flow , we can expect the uv divergences near the boundary to cancel .",
    "we will now show this calculation explicitly .",
    "following the proposal , we will define the _ relative complexity _ via the proportionality @xmath111 where @xmath112 is meant to be the volume of the ( co - dimension one ) @xmath21 slices of our bulk geometry .",
    "due to the time reflection symmetry of the btz geometry and its conformal diagram , the @xmath21 slice is an equal - time slice anchored at the two boundaries at times @xmath113 with extremal volume , as required by the prescriptions , @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that while the definition of fidelity susceptibility can be easily generalised to the case of mixed boundary states @xcite , this is not so clear with complexity , see however @xcite .",
    "we will hence assume that we are working in a two sided black hole spacetime , dual to a thermofield double ( -like ) pure state .",
    "as the numerical solutions obtained in @xcite and depicted in figure [ fig::backreaction ] are only on one side of the einstein - rosen ( er ) bridge ( and outside of the event horizon ) , we have to conjecture that the state can be purified by adding another copy of the kondo model on the other side of the er bridge .",
    "approach a constant tension solution of the form ( however with a different value @xmath114 ) near the horizon , and it can be explicitly shown that such a constant tension solution can be analytically and symmetrically ( ! ) extended throughout the entire penrose diagram of the btz black hole , i.e.  behind the horizon and to the other side of the er bridge .",
    "furthermore , a similar purification of the finite temperature kondo model was achieved in the kondo mera model proposed in @xcite . ]    in short , we define the relative complexity at @xmath115 to be proportional to the loss of bulk volume compared to @xmath116 .",
    "the induced metric on the @xmath21 slice of the btz black hole reads @xmath117 and consequently we find @xmath118 where , for the moment , we have retained an explicit uv cutoff @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , the integrand in diverges both near the horizon @xmath120 as explained in section [ sec::kondomodel ] . ] and",
    "near the boundary @xmath121 , however , the divergence at the horizon is mild and can be integrated over .",
    "what about the boundary ? a priori , might be divergent in the limit @xmath122 , but as we have discussed above the branes all approach @xmath121 with the same leading ( linear ) behaviour @xmath123 , and as by definition also @xmath124 , we see that @xmath125 goes to zero strictly faster than @xmath126 .",
    "hence , also the divergence near the boundary of the integrand of will be mild enough to carry out the integral , yielding a finite result in the limit @xmath122 , see figure [ fig::relcomplex ] .    .",
    "although , as discussed in the text , in the kondo model this quantity is by definition finite as @xmath122 , we have calculated these points using an explicit cutoff @xmath127 in order to avoid numerical problems .",

    "first of all , as explained above , the depicted values are manifestly finite .",
    "secondly , we see that as @xmath128 , the loss of bulk volume is monotonous .",
    "this may suggest that there is a complexity / fidelity susceptibility analogue of the affleck - ludwig @xmath0-theorem for holographic bcfts .",
    "we will discuss this possibility in more detail in sections [ sec::theorem ] and [ sec::conc ] .      before doing so , however , it will be very instructive to compare the relative complexity defined in to a quantity named _ _ impurity entropy__@xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the entanglement entropy for a boundary interval @xmath131 $ ] in the backreacted geometry depicted in figure [ fig::backreaction ] , while @xmath132 is the similar result for a trivial embedding @xmath133 .",
    "details on the calculation of this quantity in the holographic kondo model were given in @xcite , here we will only quickly point out three relevant points :    * just like @xmath134 , @xmath135 is manifestly finite as the uv divergences in cancel .",
    "however , this cancellation is much less intricate , @xmath135 would remain finite even if @xmath123 would not hold in the kondo model .",
    "hence the finiteness of @xmath134 is a stricter consistency condition on the model than the finiteness of @xmath135 .",
    "we will come back to this issue in section [ sec::conc ] . *",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this quantity can be related to the boundary entropy or _",
    "@xmath0-function _ via the limit @xmath136 in fact , in @xcite it was explicitly checked that the holographic kondo model satisfies the @xmath0-theorem as expected for holographic bcfts based on the proof by takayanagi @xcite .",

    "this result is not dependent on the specific details of the kondo effect and can hence be expected to be valid for a broad class of bcfts . correspondingly , based on a simple geometrical approximation we showed in @xcite that this type of formula can also be reproduced very generically in holographic ads@xmath22/bcft@xmath23 models . to our current knowledge ,",
    "no similar generic low temperature approximation formula exists for complexity or fidelity susceptibility of bcfts , and no generic result for @xmath137 analogous to can be derived in ads / bcft with simple geometrical approximations .",

    "in this section we will prove the finding of section [ sec::volumeloss ] , i.e.  the monotonous decrease of the bulk volume when moving along the rg flow , for general ads@xmath22/bcft@xmath23 models of the type .",

    "the importance of such energy conditions in static ads@xmath22/bcft@xmath23 models has been discussed in great detail in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarise : as the worldvolume of @xmath30 is @xmath61 dimensional in an ads@xmath22/bcft@xmath23 model , it follows that in the static case , by effectively using lightcone - coordinates , we can decompose the energy momentum - tensor on @xmath30 in terms of two scalar quantities @xmath2 and @xmath143 according to @xmath144 here , @xmath2 is the trace of @xmath44 while @xmath143 is the _ traceless part_. similarly , @xmath32 is the induced metric as before , while @xmath145 is a symmetric traceless tensor that can be uniquely constructed from @xmath32 and the timelike killing vector present by the assumption of staticity . in terms of these scalar quantities ,",
    "various energy conditions take a remarkably simple form , e.g. @xmath146 and what we will refer to as the @xmath61 dimensional analogue of the @xmath147 while nec and wec are taking the same role in this study as in many other investigations of gravitational physics , it is important to reiterate the phenomenological importance of the sec in ads@xmath22/bcft@xmath23 models that has been discussed in more detail in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that when both wec and sec are non - trivially satisfied at the same time , the embedding profile @xmath54 solving the equations will return to the boundary in a @xmath148-shaped way .",
    "conversely , in order to obtain embeddings for @xmath30 which reach from the boundary to the event horizon as for example in figure [ fig::backreaction ] , either wec or sec have to be violated .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we found that the matter content in the kondo model explicitly leads to a violation of the sec .    in terms of energy conditions , we will hence make the following assumptions , see also figure [ fig::deltamu ] .",
    "we assume that for some @xmath85 along the rg flow ( @xmath149 ) the embedding is given by a function @xmath150 solving for the energy momentum tensor @xmath151 . moving an infinitesimal step @xmath152 along the rg flow",
    ", we find the embedding @xmath153 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath154 .",
    "for the physical reasons explained above , it seems prudent to assume that the nec is satisfied and that the sec is violated or saturated for both @xmath85 and @xmath155 : @xmath156 what conditions can or should we impose for physical reasons on @xmath157 and @xmath158 directly ? in the kondo model , along the rg flow the scalar field @xmath159 condenses and hence adds more and more positive energy to the energy - momentum tensor , consequently it seem sensible to demand the nec @xmath160 for each infinitesimal step @xmath152 .",
    "interestingly , in @xcite we found a close relationship between nec and sec , when expressed as functions of @xmath74 .",
    "energy - momentum conservation for a static embedding in a btz background implies @xmath161 as @xmath162 outside of the horizon , this means that the nec implies that the sec has a tendency to become more satisfied ( or less violated ) as one moves from the boundary into the bulk . if the sec is satisfied at the boundary and the nec holds everywhere , then the sec is also satisfied everywhere .",
    "this motivates that also along the rg flow parametrised by @xmath85 , although the sec will always be violated , it should have the tendency to become _ less violated _ towards the ir .",
    "we will hence make use of the assumption .",
    "even more , in this model we find that the stronger condition @xmath163 is also satisfied , which together with implies . ]",

    "is fixed by @xmath168 for any @xmath85 , implies @xmath169 for any @xmath167 .",
    "analogously to , we hence find this is also related to the @xmath0-theorem .",
    "as explained in @xcite , due to @xmath170 , i.e.  the boundary entropy is given be the extra piece of black hole event horizon visible due to the non - trivial backreaction .",
    "the above argument then also implies the @xmath0-theorem . ]",
    "@xmath171 hence we have proven that for any infinitesimal step @xmath152 along the rg flow , the bulk volume can not increase .",
    "consequently , the bulk volume is a monotonously decreasing function along the rg flow parametrised by @xmath85 , just as seen in the example of the kondo model in figure [ fig::relcomplex ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , that will only be finite if @xmath172 , i.e.  if the @xmath173sec , is _ saturated _ at the boundary .",
    ", this is indeed the case for @xmath174 as discussed in @xcite . more generally , for a massive scalar field @xmath175 living on the effectively @xmath61 dimensional space @xmath30 , we find @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the @xmath108 behaviour of the energy - momentum tensor on @xmath30 will hence depend on the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath178 , and the conditions , will be saturated at the boundary if no new modes of @xmath175 that do not sufficiently vanish at the boundary get turned on as the parameter @xmath85 is varied .",
    "note that in the kondo model , the gauge field @xmath82 has a divergent component near the boundary in , but as @xmath30 is kept fixed , this does not affect the change of @xmath2 and @xmath143 near the boundary as @xmath85 is varied . ]",
    "in this final section , we will discuss the results obtained in sections [ sec::volumeloss ] and [ sec::theorem ] , comment on a few technical details , and give an outlook on further possible interesting research directions .    as explained in section[sec::kondomodel ] , when working with the kondo model we have scaled @xmath179 , so that the bulk metric @xmath31 on @xmath27 in constant along the rg flow parametrised by @xmath85 , and the change of the geometry manifests itself only in a change of the embedding @xmath30 into @xmath27 . however , we have argued that this should be equivalent to keeping @xmath85 fixed and varying @xmath102 instead .",
    "there now appears a technical detail relating to the choice of cutoffs . in the definition ,",
    "we are comparing two different spacetimes with each other , so strictly speaking we make _ two _ choices of a cutoff , @xmath180 and @xmath181 . in section [ sec::volumeloss ]",
    ", we have chosen these two cutoffs to be the same _ after _ scaling @xmath182 .",
    "if we had for example done so _ before _ doing this rescaling , would have gained an additional term . ]",
    "note that when scaling the coordinates ( and @xmath119 ) , we also scale the infinite boundary volume @xmath183 .",
    "hence results like @xmath184 are invariant if we also scale the infinite @xmath185 correctly .",
    "this affects the @xmath186 part of the comparison . @xmath187 which might spoil the decrease and monotonicity behaviour found in sections [ sec::volumeloss ] and [ sec::theorem ] .",
    "how serious is this problem , and how can we arrive at a physical choice of cutoffs @xmath119 ? to answer this question , we should first note that precisely the same problem appears in the definition of impurity entropy given in .",
    "there , two divergent quantities calculated in two a priori different spacetimes are subtracted to obtain a finite result .",
    "entanglement entropy for @xmath61 dimensional ( b)cfts diverges with @xmath188 in the uv cutoff , so we see that a different choice of cutoff for the two terms in would lead to a similar term as in , spoiling for example the result .",
    "the question should hence be : _ which _ two states are we comparing in the definitions and , respectively ? in the definition , both states `` impurity present '' and `` impurity absent '' have physical meaning at any @xmath25 . in principle",
    "it should be possible to prepare them in a lab and carry out measurements on them . the uv cutoff @xmath119",
    "would then be physically set by the lattice spacing of the metal under investigation , which would indeed be the same for both cases .",
    "for the example of relative complexity , the situation is a little bit more difficult : we need to specify what we precisely mean with the quantities labeled by @xmath99 in and .",
    "clearly , the high temperature uv fixed point of the system can not be prepared in a lab for low temperatures , as this would be oxymoronic .",
    "however , the reader should be reminded ( section [ sec::kondomodel ] ) that in the holographic kondo model , the formation of the kondo cloud is described by a phase transition ( see footnote [ fn::largen ] ) .",
    "the uv fixed point at @xmath99 is described by the constant tension solution with the tension given by , while for @xmath100 the condensed phase is thermodynamically preferred . however , even for @xmath100 it is still possible to define the uncondensed phase and calculate the corresponding ( constant tension ) bulk geometry",
    ". it may be instable due to thermodynamic fluctuations , but at least in a mathematical sense it exists for any @xmath189 , and can be used in as the reference bulk spacetime in a physical way .",
    "as we are then in genuinely comparing two spacetimes at the same temperature , it appears physical to choose the cutoffs to be equivalent .- theorem . ]",
    "as we have noted in section [ sec::volumeloss ] , the finiteness of @xmath137 is tied to much stricter conditions than the finiteness of @xmath190 .",
    "furthermore , on the example of the low temperature approximation and the lack of a complexity analogue thereof , we saw that complexity is more sensitive to details of the model at hand .",
    "this can be seen both as a detriment and as an advantage .",
    "first of all , it might be a detriment , because holographic studies are usually most relevant to real world physics when focusing on universal quantities , behaviours or mechanisms .",
    "this is due to the simple fact that there is no real world physical system with an exact holographic dual .",
    "the absence of universal results for complexity that a broad range of bcfts can be expected to share ( like for impurity entropy ) is hence disappointing .",
    "also , the fact that the volume in obtains non - negligible contributions both from the near horizon and the near boundary part of the spacetime seems to imply that @xmath137 mixes up uv and ir contributions , and may hence not be a clean variable to study rg flows .",
    "however , the peculiarities of @xmath137 may also have their advantages . as noted in section [ sec::volumeloss ]",
    ", the reason why @xmath137 is finite is that all curves approach the boundary with the same slope @xmath191 .",
    "using @xmath74 again as the rg scale instead of @xmath102 or @xmath85 , this is clearly a consequence of all these curves coming from the same uv fixed point , so to say .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath137 hence acts as a built in check whether the spacetimes compared in really can belong to the same rg flow .",
    "only once the system has _",
    "fully _ reached its ir fixed point , we expect the corresponding embedding to be given by a constant tension solution similar to , however with a different tension , i.e.  a different value of @xmath114",
    ". only then would @xmath137 diverge .",
    "for the kondo model , this would imply the expectation that as @xmath128 , the results in figure [ fig::relcomplex ] would stay finite for finite @xmath25 , but diverge at @xmath192 .",
    "this would be an important qualitative difference between @xmath137 and the boundary entropy @xmath193 , which is also monotonous but does not diverge even at @xmath192 .",
    "the main result of this paper was the proof of volume loss in section [ sec::theorem ] .",
    "if the holographic proposals and/or are correct , this would suggest the existence of a complexity / fidelity susceptibility analogue of the @xmath0-theorem . what would the physical interpretation of such a theorem be ? in terms of , a monotonic decrease of complexity along the rg flow would indicate that as we flow from the uv to the ir , the state of the field theory gets simpler .",
    "a hypothetical quantum - computer would need less gates to prepare the ir state from a simple reference state than to prepare the uv state .",
    "qualitatively , this seems like a reasonable physical statement , and the theorem of section [ sec::theorem ] makes this more precise in a certain way .",
    "interestingly , as we have speculated above , in the holographic kondo model it is expected that @xmath137 stays finite along the rg flow but likely diverges for @xmath194 .",
    "this would mean that taking a generic state from along the rg flow , it would be possible to undo the rg flow and recreate the uv state with a finite number of quantum gates . taking the ir state however ,",
    "from which _ all _ uv degrees of freedom have vanished , it would take us an infinite amount of quantum gates to recreate the uv state .",
    "it is interesting to compare this intuition with results from tensor network models of bcfts @xcite , or the entropic @xmath0-theorem proven in @xcite .",
    "there , the rg flow was interpreted in quantum information theoretic terms as an increasing _ distinguishability _ between the uv state and states along the rg flow .",
    "qualitatively , the more quantum gates a quantum computer needs in order to transform one state into the other , the more distinguishable the two states might be . the @xmath0-theorems of this paper and of @xcite hence seem to point in a similar direction , although they are very different in their details . furthermore , if the conjecture of @xcite that the lack of complexity ( called _ uncomplexity _ ) is a resource in quantum computations is correct , then general results about when systems tend to attain low complexity , such as a complexity @xmath0-theorem , may be very useful .    from the point of view of the proposal on the other hand , our results suggest the following qualitative intuition : the fidelity susceptibility studied in @xcite measures the closeness of two states after a perturbation by a marginal operator .",
    "the monotonicity theorem of section [ sec::theorem ] hence implies that as we move towards the ir , the field theory states ( even after a small perturbation ) become more and more similar . in the ir , so to say , the perturbed states are still closer to each other .",
    "last but not least , there are a few future research directions that we can now propose .",
    "can the proof of section [ sec::theorem ] be formulated with a less restrictive set of assumptions ?",
    "can one compare the geometrical results of this paper and of @xcite to tensor - network ( specifically mera ) models of bcfts @xcite ?",
    "after all , complexity by its very definition is clearly a quantity of relevance for tensor networks .",
    "can we generalise the results of this paper to higher dimensional ads / bcft models ?",
    "this may not be trivial , as in @xcite , it was found that for ads@xmath195 the complexity of formation had some rather peculiar features that did not generalise to higher dimensions .",
    "is there also a complexity / fidelity susceptibility analogue of the @xmath196-theorem proven in @xcite ?",
    "a number of complications in this work came from the fact that following the @xmath0-theorem , we used @xmath102 respectively the chemical potential @xmath85 as parameter along the rg flow , instead of the radial coordinate @xmath74 .",
    "this allowed us to avoid working with subregion complexity , for which a field theory definition in terms of a number of quantum gates is much less clear , due to the dual state being mixed .",
    "see however the discussions in @xcite .",
    "would the use of subregion complexity allow us to derive a different kind of @xmath0-theorem , maybe more similar to the zero - temperature `` entropic @xmath0-theorem '' of @xcite ? the most important question is : can we derive a similar monotonicity theorem for the action proposal @xcite of complexity ? in the ads / bcft models studied in this paper , the loss of volume @xmath6 was not a result of some intricate geometric feature affecting only the extremal slice at @xmath21 , it was simply the result of a loss of bulk points .",
    "this implies that generically , lengths and volumes , however they may be precisely defined , will monotonously decrease along the rg flow . in this sense",
    ", we can also view the @xmath0-theorem as a consequence of the volume loss , as it is satisfied because certain bulk geodesic lengths get shorter along the rg flow @xcite , see also footnote [ fn::gtheorem ] .",
    "hence , we have reason to expect that the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) patch will also shrink . in the action proposal @xcite , this wdw patch is the co - dimension zero volume over which the action is to be integrated .",
    "consequently , if the integrand does not grow strong enough to compensate the shrinking of the integral domain , it is indeed expected that a @xmath0-theorem analogue will also hold for the action proposal for holographic complexity .",
    "the detailed study of these questions will be left for future research , however .",
