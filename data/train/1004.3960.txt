    "how to manipulate spin in condensed - matter system has been the main challenge for both experimentalists and theorists in this community .",

    "this pair of surface bound states contribute to a spin current near the surface of a ti.@xcite    the concept of ti can also be generalized to superconductors ( sc ) .",
    "a simple example is the ( 2d ) @xmath1-wave superconductor with its order parameter given by @xmath5 .",
    "we can see explicitly from the order parameter @xmath6 $ ] that the cooper pairs with down(up ) spins have a counterclockwise(clockwise ) motion .",
    "this state is clearly time - reversal symmetric .",
    "each species is in an axial state , considered in , e.g. , ref.@xcite , with the phase of the cooper pair wavefunction advances ( decreases ) by @xmath7 when the angle of the momentum direction advances by the same angle . considering the surface of this superconductor adjacent to vacuum ,",
    "the incident and reflected quasiparticles see an order parameter with a different phase factor , analogous to the case of a josephson junction .",
    "a pair of surface bound states with opposite spin projections propagate in opposite directions , generating no charge but finite spin current , as in the case of a topological insulator . moreover",
    ", straightforward generalization of the results of ref.@xcite implies that a singly quantized vortex of this superconductor possesses a pair of zero - energy majorana states inside its vortex core .",
    "in contrast , the order parameter of an @xmath8-wave singlet superconductor do not change sign over the fermi surface .",
    "no surface bound states are topologically required and the superconductor thus belongs to trivial class .    for noncentrosymmetric superconductors ( ncsc ) , such as",
    "the compounds cept@xmath4si,@xcite li@xmath0pt@xmath4b,@xcite and cerhsi@xmath4,@xcite and the 2d electron gas between two insulating layers,@xcite complication arises due to the presence of parity - broken spin - orbital interaction and the singlet - triplet mixed superconducting order parameters.@xcite for example , for a system with no up - down reflection symmetry , the s - wave singlet order parameter @xmath9 and the triplet order parameters @xmath10 with the d - vector given by @xmath11 ) would naturally mix since they are of the _ same _ symmetry.@xcite alternatively , the two fermi surfaces with opposite helicities can be associated with two different superconducting gaps as a result of the broken inversion symmetry.@xcite nevertheless , the topological classifications still can be deduced from the existence of zero - energy vortex bound states@xcite or the surface bound states.@xcite these studies reveal that only the relative signs of the pairing terms on the opposite - helicity bands matter for the topology , which can also be shown by more explicit topological arguments.@xcite ncsc with opposite signs of pairing on the two bands resembles the pure @xmath1-wave triplet superconductor in that a pair of topologically protected zero energy or surface bound states reside within the vortex core or at the surface , respectively , while these topological bound states do not exist at all in the ncsc with same sign of pairing , which resembles the pure @xmath8-wave singlet sc .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider in more detail the surface of a ncsc , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , as a function of the singlet @xmath9 and triplet @xmath10 order parameters .",
    "for simplicity , here we would not consider the dispersion along the z axis ( or effectively 2d ) nor the splitting of the fermi surfaces due to spin orbit interactions .",
    "the absence of spin - orbital coupling may in fact correspond to a narrowly accessible physical regime in mixed - parity superconductivity.@xcite our simplification however does not affect the main physics that we would like to explain in this paper .",
    "comments on this aspect will be given later .",
    "for the present geometry , there is no xy plane reflection symmetry , whereas the time - reversal symmetry and the xz plane reflection symmetry are left intact .",
    "following the same symmetry arguments as in our previous paper,@xcite the magnetization along any directions automatically vanish due to the time - reversal invariance .",
    "however , the spin currents @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 can in principle be allowed .",
    "we shall examine whether these spin currents are finite .    in the pure p - wave case ( @xmath15=0 ) , the bound states have their spins quantized parallel or antiparallel to the z - axes .",
    "only @xmath12 is non - zero.@xcite we would examine what happen to these states when @xmath9 is finite , especially their spin directions .",
    "we shall see that the spins are no longer polarized along @xmath16 in the general case .",
    "in the context of topological superconductor , the parity - mixed order parameters with @xmath17 belong to the nontrivial z@xmath0 class,@xcite and the pair of surface bound states with opposite spin projections propagating in opposite directions still exist .",
    "these surface bound states can in principle be detected by tunneling conductance , which has now been investigated in great detail theoretically.@xcite we shall however concentrate on the spin currents in this paper .",
    "these surface states can still generate the spin currents @xmath12 ( and in principle also @xmath13 , but see below ) .",
    "however , as we shall see , this is _ not _ the only contribution . for the case of @xmath18 ,",
    "the superconductor belongs to the trivial category and it is expected that the surface bound states do not survive .",
    "an immediate question is , at the transition point for @xmath19 , whether the spin current drops to zero abruptly , signaling the transition of topology , or it is smoothly decreasing towards zero , coinciding with the pure @xmath8-wave case only when @xmath10 vanishes . in the following , we shall consider the above questions by evaluating quantities such as the momentum- and spin - resolved density of states and the spin current of the ncsc with varying ratio @xmath20 .",
    "we find that nonzero spin current @xmath12 is dictated only by the broken symmetry and can be finite for both the topological trivial and non - trivial superconductors .",
    "the contribution to this spin current turns out to arise also from non - topological _ continuum _ states with energies between the two gaps @xmath21 .",
    "these states are present in both the topological trivial and non - trivial superconductors , and they are not required by topology .",

    "no subgap state is found as in fig.[trivial](a ) . however , there is still an asymmetry between @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the continuum states between the two gaps , so that these states continue to contribute to @xmath12 .",
