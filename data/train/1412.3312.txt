    "nitride compound semiconductors such as gan and aln which have a wide energy gap withstand high breakdown electric fields and support excellent thermal stability @xcite .",
    "the heterostructure field - effect transistor ( hfet ) using a gan - based heterostructure is very promising for high - power radio frequency and high - mobility operations , owing to its high electron density , high electron drift velocity as well as its high drain breakdown voltage . particularly interesting",
    "are lattice - matched inaln / aln / gan heterostructures @xcite , in which a two - dimensional electron gas forms in the undoped gan layer near the interface of the gan layer and the one nanometre thick aln spacer , due to internal _ spontaneous polarization _",
    "alone , i.e. , with no strain - induced polarization by the piezoelectric effect .",
    "as such an electron gas arises in the absence of doping and lattice strain , high electron density ( 2 @xmath3/@xmath4 ) as well as high drift velocity ( 3 @xmath5 cm / s ) can occur in the lattice - matched heterostructures .",
    "the electrons in the quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) gan channel are heated up due to high electric power , with the electron temperature @xmath0 elevated above the lattice temperature @xmath6 ( i.e. room temperature ) .",
    "electron temperatures up to 2500 k have been measured using a microwave noise technique for a lattice - matched inaln / aln / gan heterostructure with an areal electron density of @xmath7/@xmath4 in the gan channel @xcite .",
    "heat dissipation in the gan channel is a complicated process which includes energy relaxation of the hot electrons mainly by emission of polar - optical phonons , decay of the polar - optical phonons into acoustic phonons via anharmonic interactions and diffusion of the excess acoustic phonons into the remote heat sink .",
    "the optical phonon lifetime has been measured for gan - based heterostructures , which in general falls in the range from 0.1 to 1.7 ps @xcite - except for the case of the electron density @xmath8/@xmath4 , and depends on both the electron density @xcite and electron temperature @xcite .",
    "as the optical phonon lifetime is much longer than the frhlich scattering time ( @xmath210 fs for gan @xcite ) , the emission of polar optical phonons is very fast compared to their decay into acoustic phonons , and a large population of nonequilibrium ( `` hot '' ) phonons are accumulated leading to a slowdown in energy relaxation ( termed hot - phonon effect ) .",
    "hot phonons also result in an increase of electrical resistance and impose limitations on electron drift velocities @xcite .    the average power dissipation @xmath9 and energy relaxation time @xmath10 are two key parameters for describing electron energy relaxation in semiconductors under an external electric field .",
    "apparently both quantities depend on the _ electron temperature _ , and knowing how they depend on @xmath0 is fundamental to the optimization of the hfet devices @xcite . in experimental studies of hot - electron energy relaxation in gan - based heterostructures @xcite , the dependence of the electron temperature @xmath0 on the supplied power , which is equal to the power dissipated to the lattice by the hot electrons under steady - state conditions ,",
    "directly _ measured using the microwave noise technique , and then the electron energy relaxation time as a function of the electron temperature was deduced by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the average power supplied to each electron .",
    "for the lattice - matched heterostructures the relaxation time was found to fall sharply at the low electron temperatures and decrease very slowly at the high electron temperatures ( @xmath131200 k ) @xcite .",
    "microscopically , energy relaxation of the hot electrons is governed by scattering with polar - optical phonons . in bulk",
    "gan the polar modes are treated as the longitudinal optical ( lo ) modes of a single frequency @xmath14 . in a simplification",
    "therefore the polar - optical phonons of the heterostructures are usually taken to be the lo phonons of the bulk material such as gan .",
    "this is referred to as the three - dimensional phonon ( 3dp ) model . according to the dielectric continuum ( dc ) model , however",
    "the eigenmodes of the polar - optical vibrations in the heterostructure include half - space lo modes and interface modes , and all these modes interact with the electrons in the quasi-2d channel .",
    "both phonon models have been used to study energy relaxation and momentum relaxation for gaas - based quantum wells @xcite .",
    "for gan - based quasi-2d systems , the 3dp model was used for an early study on the momentum relaxation and low - field electron transport in gan quantum wells @xcite . in principle , the phonon eigenmodes of quasi-2d gan heterostructures should be considered for electron transport studies .",
    "indeed , the dc model has been employed in recent years to study electron - phonon scattering associated with the various phonon modes @xcite , as well as the electron momentum relaxation @xcite and energy relaxation @xcite in gan heterostructures .",
    "mori and ando derived a sum rule @xcite from the dc model which showed that the sum of the form factors associated with half - space and interface modes was equal to the form factor for bulk phonons .",
    "later , using a microscopic model register derived a similar sum rule @xcite to prove that the _ total _ electron - phonon scattering rate in the heterostructure was independent of the phonon basis sets , as long as each set was orthonormal and complete .",
    "these sum rules seem to imply that the dc and 3dp phonon models would yield equivalent results for the energy relaxation in gan heterostructures .",
    "however this claim is only partly true , and caution should be taken in applying the sum rules to the energy relaxation in gan heterostructures .",
    "first , in register s scattering rate sum rule polar scattering with electrons is assumed to be made by phonons of a uniform frequency @xmath14 @xcite ( i.e. , all the phonon modes are _ degenerate _ ) . as is discussed in appendix a",
    ", there is no scattering rate sum rule as the normal modes of the heterostructure including the interface and half - space modes are not degenerate .",
    "in fact the interface phonons differ significantly from the half - space phonons in both phonon frequency and electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "second , as the scalar potential of the interface modes decreases exponentially from the interface according to @xmath15 , scattering with interface modes is weak in wide wells making the 3dp evaluation accurate .",
    "indeed , for quantum wells with widths greater than 100 @xmath16 the 3dp model suffices for the evaluation of scattering rates @xcite , energy loss rates @xcite and momentum relaxation rates @xcite . for narrow wells however scattering with interface phonons becomes increasingly important , and as such , the two phonon models yield quite different rates for gaas quantum wells @xcite as well as gan heterostructures @xcite . for gan heterostructures with a 30 @xmath16-wide channel",
    "the 3dp model underestimates momentum relaxation rates just below the bulk lo phonon energy by 70% , and overestimates rates immediately above the lo phonon energy by 40% compared to the dc model @xcite .",
    "however as far as we know there has been no comparison of energy relaxation rates for gan heterostructures based on the two phonon models .",
    "third , in gan heterostructures screening from the mobile quasi-2d electrons is strong due to the high electron density .",
    "the scattering rate sum rule becomes invalid causing quite different dc and 3dp rates when screening is accounted for .",
    "fourth , the scattering rate sum rule is valid with an equilibrium phonon distribution being taken as an important prerequisite @xcite . in the gan hfet where the hot - phonon effect must be taken into account ,",
    "phonon modes are clearly in nonequilibrium , with the consequence that different modes make different contributions to the energy relaxation process . in this circumstance",
    "it is necessary to use the correct normal modes of the gan heterostructure to calculate the energy relaxation .",
    "previous calculations for gaas quantum wells have shown that the energy relaxation rates in the hot - phonon regime depend on the phonon models used @xcite .    recently , using the dc model the authors calculated hot - electron energy relaxation in a typical lattice - matched inaln / aln / gan heterostructure @xcite .",
    "we found that the experimentally observed dramatic fall at low @xmath0 @xcite was caused chiefly by the fast decreased hpe and electron screening , while the very slow decrease at the high temperatures was due to the fast optical - phonon decay . in this paper",
    "we study the energy relaxation of the hot electrons in the heterostructure with both dc and 3dp models .",
    "as the 3dp approach is relatively simple and thus convenient for practical calculation , one of course wants to know how energy relaxation results estimated by this model differ from those calculated with the dc model , and further what causes the discrepancies .",
    "we pay particular attention to a quantitative comparison of the @xmath0-dependencies of the power dissipation and relaxation time at high temperatures calculated with the two models , as the high @xmath0 relaxation process is of great interest in terms of hfet devices .",
    "this comparison can be made with regard to only the _ total _ power loss and relaxation time .",
    "on the other hand , there is an advantage of the use of the dc model , in that the contributions from the quasi-2d phonon modes to the energy relaxation can be singled out .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to find and understand the behaviours of the half - space modes and interface modes , in particular those of the _ interface modes _",
    ", in the energy relaxation process in such _ narrow _ channel gan heterostructures .",
    "the comparison with the 3dp calculations also provides a simple means to examine how the interface phonons contribute . equally important from the electron gas side",
    "is screening .",
    "clearly dynamic effects of screening from the electrons need to be included owing to the high frequencies of the polar modes . for these purposes",
    ", a comprehensive study needs to be carried out for the energy relaxation in the gan heterostructures , in which an emphasis is put on how energy relaxation results from the two phonon models differ when both hot phonons and screening are taken into account .",
    "therefore , using the two phonon models , the power loss and energy relaxation time are calculated as functions of the electron temperature , for a number of phonon scattering processes with electron screening included or excluded .",
    "the energy relaxation results from scattering with the half - space and interface phonons are compared and examined , and then the _ total _ power loss and relaxation time are further compared with those obtained from the 3dp approximation .",
    "the sum rules for the electron - phonon interactions are closely checked for the _ pure _ phonon emission process ( i.e. , with no hpe ) .",
    "for the _ net _ phonon emission process where the hot - phonon reabsorption is accounted for , special attention is paid to the difference in the dc and 3dp calculations to examine the 3dp model in the evaluation of the energy relaxation in particular at high electron temperatures .",
    "we found that the two models yield very close power loss values and relaxation times , the discrepancies being caused by how much the high energy interface phonons contribute to the energy relaxation . with no hot phonons or screening",
    "the power loss calculated from the 3dp model is 5% smaller than the dc power dissipation , whereas slightly larger 3dp power loss ( by less than 4% with a phonon lifetime from 0.1 to 1 ps ) is obtained throughout the electron temperature range after including both the hpe and screening .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the dc and 3dp models for lattice - matched inaln / aln / gan heterostructures are described where the polar phonon modes and associated electron - phonon interactions are given .",
    "then in section iii a formulation of the power dissipation and energy relaxation time in such heterostructures is presented , taking into account non - equilibrium polar optical phonons , electron degeneracy , and screening from the mobile electrons .",
    "effective numerical techniques in calculating the generation rates and power loss are also described , in terms of handling the integrals involved . in section iv , first we show results of the non - equilibrium phonon occupation numbers for both half - space and interface modes in a typical lattice - matched inaln / aln / gan heterostructure .",
    "these results are used to analyze how hot phonons slow down the quasi-2d electron energy relaxation in the high - temperature region .",
    "then , by choosing two gan heterostructures with different channel widths we compare power dissipation results from the dc and 3dp models for the simple case with no screening .",
    "this is to check the sum rules as well as investigate phonon confinement effects and roles the half - space and interface modes play in the respective pure and net phonon emission processes . in order to examine the usual 3dp approximation in the evaluation of energy relaxation",
    ", we further compare the dc and 3dp results of power loss and energy relaxation time in the lattice - matched heterostructure for a number of detailed phonon scattering processes with or without electron screening .",
    "comparisons with the experimental data as well as the bulk gan situation are also made , and the hot - phonon and screening effects are discussed in great detail .",
    "finally , section v summarizes the main results obtained . in appendix a , starting with the detailed generation rate expressions for the half - space , interface and bulk lo phonons , a restoration of the mori - ando sum rule is made .",
    "then the form factor sum rule is used to prove that the power dissipation values obtained from the dc and 3dp models are in general different in the pure emission process , except for the limiting case when scattering with interface phonons is sufficiently weak such as in wide gan channels , or when the degenerate modes approximation is imposed as in the study by register @xcite .",
    "these are used to analyze and interpret our energy relaxation results . in appendix b",
    ", we show the minimum electron kinetic energy for phonon absorption and fermi - dirac integrals involved in our energy relaxation calculation , both being functions of the phonon wavevector , which are used for analyzing the non - equilibrium phonon distribution .",
    "there are two types of polar optical modes in a bulk semiconductor of the wurtzite structure such as gan and aln owing to anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy however is very small @xcite , allowing the semiconductor to be treated as a cubic crystal with lo polar vibration modes @xcite .",
    "the phonon modes of the considered heterostructure in@xmath17al@xmath18n",
    "/ aln / gan is dealt with in a simpler way .",
    "as the indium content in the outer barrier is small ( @xmath19 ) the binary alloy in@xmath17al@xmath18n is treated as aln , the same material as the central barrier .",
    "this in effect simplifies the lattice matched heterostructure in@xmath17al@xmath18n",
    "/ aln / gan as a single heterostructure aln / gan @xcite . in the dielectric continuum model , the polar vibration modes of a single heterostructure consist of half - space modes and interface modes @xcite .",
    "the half - space modes have the frequencies of the bulk polar modes of the two constituent materials , whose scalar potentials and electric fields occur in the respective constituent regions .",
    "the interface modes have different frequencies from the bulk polar modes , and an interface mode has lattice vibrations and electric fields in both constituent regions .    for the in@xmath17al@xmath18n / aln / gan heterostructure , let the growth direction be @xmath20 and the interface between aln and gan be at @xmath21 , with the barriers in the space @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the lattice constant ) and the electron - containing active region in the space @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "let @xmath27 be the position vector in the plane parallel to the interface .",

    "the total dc power dissipation becomes smaller than that evaluated with the 3dp model [ fig .",

    ", we found that interface phonon absorption causes negative momentum relaxation rates @xcite , and also an increased interaction with the @xmath177 modes leads to a reduction of phonon lifetime @xcite .    in both heterostructures the calculations with both phonon models [ figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) ] show that the electron power dissipated increases rapidly with @xmath0 at low temperatures but the increase becomes slower at high temperatures , similar to that which occurs in si - doped bulk gan @xcite . in the simpler case with no screening or hot phonons , the phonon generation number is @xmath204 for bulk lo modes , and the temperature dependence of the power loss @xmath9 , according to eq .",

    "physically the generation rate decreases as the difference in electron occupation numbers within the phonon energy @xmath164 becomes smaller at a higher electron temperature .",
    "we now include screening to make a comprehensive study of the electron power dissipation calculated with the dc and 3dp models . when both screening and hot phonons are included , strictly speaking the scattering rate sum rule is not applicable , and then one needs to find how much discrepancy the 3dp evaluation yields with respect to the dc calculation .",

    "several points can be made by comparing the power dissipation values in the various cases .",
    "first , the power dissipation is substantially reduced by static screening [ compare cases ( i ) and ( iii ) ] , whereas the reduction using dynamic screening is much smaller , which is only @xmath2 30% the reduction caused by debye screening [ compare cases ( i ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) ] .",
    "when both screening and hot phonons are included , the power loss values obtained with the static and dynamic screening models get closer as @xmath0 increases ; at @xmath0=2500 k the power loss is 14% smaller from debye screening than from the dynamic screening model .",
    "second , at the low temperatures interestingly both phonon models yield enhanced rather than slowed power dissipation when _ dynamic _ screening is included .",
    "that is , _ anti - screening _",
    "occurs when the electron temperature @xmath0 is lower than 840 k for the dc model or @xmath0@xmath208770 k for the 3dp model .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "expressions ( [ pddc ] ) and ( [ pd3dp ] ) show that mathematically the power dissipation is a sum of the contributions that are connected with the various in - plane phonon wavevectors @xmath29 .",
    "when dynamic screening is taken into account , the bare electron - phonon interaction is screened or anti - screened depending on wavevector @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath129 components in the summation contribute screening while the small-@xmath129 components which are connected to the slow motion of the electron gas contribute anti - screening @xcite , due to the dispersion of the quasi-2d electron plasma frequency . at the low electron temperatures ,",
    "the small-@xmath129 components dominate as the degenerate distribution of the dense electrons favours the electron - phonon scattering with small transfer wave - vectors @xmath129 . at the high temperatures , on the other hand ,",
    "the electrons are distributed over a large @xmath209-space , and they cause screening when the large @xmath129-components dominate .",
    "we note that antiscreening for the quasi-2d electron energy relaxation was observed early in gaas quantum wells and occurred also at low electron temperatures @xcite .",
    "third , for the three cases with no hot phonons , namely ( i ) , ( iii ) , ( iv ) , the dc model yields higher power dissipation than the 3dp model . however taking into account hot phonons , namely in the corresponding cases ( ii ) , ( v ) , ( vi )",
    "the 3dp power loss becomes larger .",
    "what causes this has become clear after our discussion above for fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ; that is , it is due to the higher - energy interface phonons .",
    "fourth , throughout the temperature range the 3dp power loss is 5% smaller than the dc power dissipation in the simplest case ( i ) , but becomes larger ( by less than 4% ) after including both hpe and screening as in cases ( v ) , ( vi ) . a similar deviation is obtained when reducing the phonon lifetime to 0.1 ps except for the static screening case where only a tiny 0.2% deviation occurs .",
    "the 3dp model yields such a close result to the dc calculation , because including screening does not alter the order of the dc and 3dp power loss values in terms of their relative magnitude [ that is , the dc power dissipation is higher .",
    "refer to cases ( i ) , ( iii ) , ( iv ) ] , while accounting for the hpe does alter the order [ compare cases ( i ) , ( ii ) ] .    experimentally , using the microwave noise technique the electron temperature @xmath0 as a function of the supplied power @xmath12",

    "the total number of electrons was estimated from the measured low - field hall mobility and channel resistance using ohm s law . under steady - state conditions ,",
    "the supplied power is equal to the _ total _ power dissipated to the lattice by the hot electrons .",
    "then one can obtain the experimental data of the _ average _ power dissipation per electron versus electron temperature ( see fig .",

    "the power loss was shown to increase with the electron temperature ( from 2 nw / electron at @xmath0=500 k , for instance , to 150 nw / electron at @xmath0=2500 k ) but the dependence is complicated by electron screening and the variation of the polar optical phonon lifetime with @xmath0 , as was discussed in our previous study @xcite . in the simple approximation where neither hot phonons nor screening is included , the calculated power dissipation is four times as large as the experimental values .",
    "accounting for screening and hpe brings the calculation much closer to the experimental data .",
    "however the theoretical values remain over 2.5 times higher in the low temperature region even with static screening which is generally believed to overestimate the screening effect , and the use of large phonon lifetimes there such as 20 ps will produce a fit with experiment .    to quantify the screening effect and/or hpe a reduction factor @xmath210 is introduced , @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the power dissipation without screening or hot phonons , and @xmath9 is the corresponding power loss when screening and/or the hot phonons are included .",

    "we see a stronger hpe at low electron temperatures , with the reduction factors decreasing with increasing the electron temperature .",

    "[ fig8 ] ) and the deviation staying within 5% when reducing the phonon lifetime to 0.1 ps . as",

    "the fall is sharp when debye screening is used as the screening wavenumber @xmath135 ( @xmath220 ) decreases fast with @xmath0 ( at @xmath0=1000 k , for instance , @xmath135 reduces to 1.7@xmath151 ) .    at _ high _ temperatures ( above 1200 k ) , on the other hand , the relaxation time , @xmath10 , stays almost flat with a very small and slow rise when a single phonon lifetime 1 ps is used throughout the temperature range .",
    "the relaxation time is 0.15 ps when static screening is used , which is slightly larger than the @xmath20.12 ps value obtained with dynamic screening .",

    "[ fig7 ] ) and to @xmath20.09 ps when dynamic screening is accounted for ( thick dotted line in fig .  [ fig7 ] ) , as the hot phonon occupation numbers are reduced in the phonon re - absorption processes compared to the case of the longer lifetime of 1 ps .",
    "this rapid relaxation means no bottleneck for the power dissipation .",
    "our calculated value @xmath20.09 ps is nearly equal to the measured high - temperature relaxation time of 0.09 ps @xcite .",
    "we note that in this case , despite it being weakened , the hot - phonon reabsorption should be included to obtain the relaxation time @xmath20.09 ps , as we found that without hpe the relaxation would be faster with @xmath2210.06 ps .    at high electron temperatures the measured relaxation time for the investigated lattice - matched heterostructure",

    "gan the electron energy relaxation is found to be much slower due to the combined screening and hot - phonon effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , the rapid energy relaxation with @xmath10 around 0.1 ps in the _ heterostructure _ means an efficient heat transfer from the hot electron gas to the lattice , which provides the heterostructure with an advantage to use in hfet devices .",

    "( [ formfh ] ) , ( [ formfb ] ) and ( [ formfi ] ) then we restore the form factor sum rule given by mori and ando @xcite @xmath257    we now proceed to applying this sum rule to the power dissipation as obtained from the dc and 3dp models .",
    "we first consider a special case , that is , when the quasi-2d channel in gan is sufficiently wide that the form factor for the interface phonons @xmath202 can be neglected .",
    "this leads to the removal of the contribution to the power dissipation from all the interface modes . inserting the @xmath147 and @xmath124 expressions ( [ nuzqa1 ] ) and ( [ nuqa1 ] ) into the power dissipation equations ( [ pddc ] ) and ( [ pd3dp ] ) respectively , and then using the obtained identities eqs .",
    "( [ sumqzhs ] ) and ( [ sumqz3d ] ) , we find that the two resulting power dissipation expressions given by the dc and 3dp models are _ identical_. in the general case , of course one has @xmath258 , the two phonon models do not yield the same power dissipation , and the difference is caused entirely by how much the true interface modes ( eigenmodes ) contribute compared to that when they are treated simply as bulk lo modes in terms of the phonon frequency and electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "this can be made more clear by the following proof .",
    "if we ignore the difference in the material parameters , such as the phonon frequencies and dielectric constants , of the two constituents of the heterostructure , and use only the gan parameters , the interface mode frequency that is given by the solution of @xmath52 simply reduces to the lo phonon frequency @xmath14 of gan , and @xmath259 for the interface modes reduces to @xmath260 for the bulk lo modes , thus making the coupling constant @xmath261 for the interface modes , @xmath179 @xcite , reduce to the frhlich coupling constant @xmath262 for the bulk lo modes , @xmath263 .",
    "this is exactly the scenario that results from the degenerate modes approximation @xcite .",
    "it then follows that the use of the mori - ando sum rule [ eq .  ( [ rulef ] ) ] results in the same dc and 3dp power dissipation .",
    "furthermore , the same electron - phonon scattering rate is also obtained with the two phonon models , which is consistent with the sum rule for the electron - phonon interaction given by register @xcite .",
    "of course the two constituent materials are different , and the true interface modes are not bulk gan lo modes , and therefore in general the dc power dissipation is different from that evaluated with the 3dp model , even in the non - hpe case , as our numerical results in sec .",

    "the following illustration is made for the half - space modes but it can be equally applied to the interface and bulk lo modes as well . the energy expression appearing in the delta function of eq .",

    "we see that the energy @xmath188 decreases steeply to the minimum value of 0 at @xmath267 , and then slowly increases as wavevector @xmath129 becomes larger .",

    "further , the fermi - dirac integral @xmath232 [ eq .  ( [ fdm12 ] ) ] is a monotonically increasing function , and this ensures that @xmath269 and consequently the rate @xmath147 is always positive as required physically .",
