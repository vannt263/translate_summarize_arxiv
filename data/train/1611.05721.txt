    "the paramount current theory of the gravitational interaction is general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the theory earned this status because of its conceptual simplicity , its intuitive geometrical interpretation and , of course , its remarkable successes in modeling gravitational phenomena .",
    "but , above the sympathy that these attributes may gender , we must accept that the theory is defective . on a philosophical ground",
    ", gr is imperfect as any mathematical representation of reality @xcite .",
    "regarding its physical predictions , gr fails in reproducing rotation curves of galaxies , mass profiles of galaxy clusters , gravitational lensing effects , cosmological data , and spacetime singularities . some of these problems can be solved or circumvented assuming the existence of dark matter .",
    "however , every experiment aimed at measuring the properties of this kind of matter has failed in its quest @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "alternative gravity theories that do not require the existence of dark components deserve study .    in this",
    "regard , m. milgrom @xcite proposed the modified newtonian dynamics theory ( mond ) to account for astrophysical phenomena without dark matter .",
    "mond correctly reproduces galactic scale observations , but the theory is deficient at galaxy cluster and cosmological scales .",
    "relativistic theories whose weak field limit coincides with mond were soon formulated .",
    "these theories were characterized by the insertion of scalar fields that couple with matter .",
    "we highlight the contributions of j. bekenstein @xcite and r. sanders @xcite .",
    "afterwards , sanders noticed that any scalar - tensor theory fails in explaining light deflection observations without dark matter , so he proposed the incorporation of vector fields to solve the problem @xcite .",
    "his ideas matured with the tensorial - vectorial - scalar ( teves ) theory of gravitation developed by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "teves is an admissible relativistic generalization of mond and a valuable alternative gravity theory . for a review of mond predictions and its relativistic extensions ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "independently , j. moffat @xcite postulated the scalar - tensor - vector gravity theory ( stvg ) , also referred as modified gravity theory ( mog ) in the literature . in stvg ,",
    "the gravitational coupling constant @xmath0 is reified to a scalar field whose numerical value usually exceeds newton s constant @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption serves to describe correctly galaxy rotation curves @xcite , clusters dynamics @xcite , bullet cluster phenomena @xcite , and cosmological data @xcite , without requiring the existence of dark contributions . in order to counteract the enhanced gravitational coupling constant on",
    "solar system scales , moffat proposed a gravitational repulsive yukawa vector field @xmath2 . in this way , newton s gravitational constant can be retrieved and stvg coincides with gr in solar system predictions .",
    "both teves and stvg seem to be good candidates for a new gravity theory .",
    "they both propose vectorial manifestations of the gravitational field .",
    "however , teves has been recently criticized @xcite under light bending and stability considerations . on these subjects ,",
    "stvg successfully describes strong and weak gravitational lensing by the bullet cluster @xcite , but stellar structure stability has not been studied yet . for this reason ,",
    "we begin the construction of stellar models in stvg .",
    "most of stvg applications are based on vacuum solutions . in this paper , we find extended matter sourced solutions .",
    "we represent spacetime with a static , spherically symmetric manifold , and matter sources with a spherically symmetric perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we solve stvg field equations and analytically derive the metric components .",
    "then , from stvg conservation equation , we obtain the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ( tov ) .",
    "these results are used to construct stvg neutron star models .",
    "we integrate numerically the modified tov equation for different neutron star equations of state ( eos ) and compare the outcomes with gr results .",
    "numerical integration is carried out with a variable - step , fourth - order , runge - kutta method .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ s_action ] we present stvg action and field equations , and explain certain simplifications valid for neutron stars stellar structure .",
    "solutions for extended matter sources are given in section [ s_solution ] .",
    "then , in section [ s_tov ] , we derive the modified tov equation for stvg .",
    "in section [ s_eos ] , we present different neutron stars eos and explain our numerical integration method . in section [ s_results ] ,",
    "we show the resulting mass - radius relation , mass - central density relation , and pressure , density , and mass profiles for distinct stvg neutron stars models , with the corresponding discussions .",
    "section [ s_conclusions ] is devoted to our main conclusions .",

    "such term served to explain galaxy rotation curves , light bending phenomena , and cosmological data , without dark matter .",
    "the second term is significant when @xmath9 and represents gravitational repulsion .",

    ", stvg coincides with gr if @xmath74 , and moffat s upper limit given by inequality corresponds to @xmath75 .",
    "the first result of our work is analytical and involves eq . , the modified tov equation for stvg .",
    "the result shows clearly the functioning of stvg gravity : enhanced gravitational attraction , represented by negative terms in the pressure derivative , is counteracted by gravitational repulsion , the latter represented by positive @xmath61-terms .",
    "recall that the contributions of the scalar fields to eq . have not been considered . future work will be devoted to the formal insertion of such brans - dicke type of fields .",
    "further results include stvg neutron stars model .",
    "we integrate eq . for each eos , for distinct values of the normalized parameter : @xmath74 ( gr)@xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "greater values of @xmath79 yield unusual results that we will discuss later , while smaller values do not present significant deviations from gr .            in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "we show the total mass - radius relation ( @xmath80 ) for different central densities , for each eos and @xmath79 values . in figure [ fig:2 ]",

    "@xcite .    from both figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] we notice that stvg coincides with gr predictions for high density neutron stars .",
    "moffat s idea of retrieving classical results from the interchange of enhanced attraction and repulsion works properly in this context .",
    "however , differences arise as the central density decreases and finds its maximum at @xmath81 .",
    "remarkably , the curves tend to converge again for lower densities .",
    "we find that stvg neutron star maximal masses exceed gr results .",
    "such stvg maxima are obtained for lower central densities than in gr , but the resulting star have larger radii .",
    "recent astronomical determinations of neutron star masses @xcite defy relativistic limits .",
    "hence , stvg stands as a strong candidate for a new gravity theory , at least in this aspect .",
    "stvg predictions are different from those of other alternative gravity theories .",
    "for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , non - perturbative , and self consistent models of neutron stars have been constructed in squared-@xmath82 gravity . for high mass neutron stars",
    "such models predict larger radii than gr , but for low mass neutron stars the behavior changes and final radii result smaller than the corresponding case in gr . in stvg ,",
    "the first trend prevails along the whole mass range , i.e. final radii are always larger than the ones in gr .",
    "contrary , as can be seen from ref .",
    "@xcite , teves models predict neutron stars with smaller masses and radii than gr , as a function of vector and scalar field coupling parameters .",
    "in figure [ fig:3 ] we display pressure , density , and mass profiles for poly and sly neutron star models . from those graphics ,",
    "we notice that stvg density and pressure profiles decrease slower than the relativistic ones .",
    "this implies that stvg mass profiles reach higher final masses .",
    "we associate this behavior with positive @xmath61-terms in eq . .",
    "fps and bsk21 profiles manifest equivalent deviations .",
    "interesting results arise if we increase the parameter @xmath79 by an order of magnitude . in figure [ fig:4 ] we plot density profiles of poly neutron stars with @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for low density neutron stars and great @xmath79",
    ", repulsive gravity causes a peculiar growing profile .",
    "however , when a certain mass is reached , the enhanced attraction dominates and the profile decreases abruptly . a similar behavior is seen in high density neutron stars but , for the highest @xmath79 , enhanced attraction always prevails .",
    "results for @xmath85 suggest that , beyond the effects of repulsive gravity , for each @xmath79 there is a limiting mass from where attraction dominates .",
    "peculiarities of these resulting density profiles may be useful when modeling pulsating stars , inhomogeneous cosmologies , or formation of galaxy filaments without dark matter .    within the approximations of our work ,",
    "we find a tighter upper limit for the parameter @xmath10 . in order to obtain neutron stars with realistic masses ,",
    "i.e. near astronomical determinations , and monotonically decreasing density profiles , we find that : @xmath86 recall that @xmath10 responds to the dynamics of the scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "the restriction given by inequality applies to the external field of solar - mass class of sources .",
    "in this paper we presented a simplified version of moffat s stvg field equations .",
    "we neglected the effects of the mass @xmath11 of the vector field because they manifest at large distances from the source , and approximated @xmath0 as a slowing varying constant .",
    "we warned the reader that the limit @xmath87 has not been theoretically explored , and may be discontinuous .",
    "also , we commented that the explicit functional form of the matter action term has not been worked out so far .",
    "formal work about these foundational issues of the theory is required and left for a separate research .",
    "we modeled a static and spherically symmetric matter distribution .",
    "then , we solved the vector field equation and constructed the total energy - momentum tensor neglecting the contributions of scalar fields .",
    "after that , we solved the metric field equations , and derived the modified tov equation from the conservation equation in stvg .",
    "we then constructed neutron star models . in order to integrate eq .",
    "we assumed four different eos .",
    "we took the restriction for @xmath88 parameter from solar system observations and defined the normalized factor @xmath79 .",
    "realistic deviations from gr arose from @xmath89 .",
    "the general feature of stvg pressure and density outcomes is a slower decreasing profile than in gr .",
    "this implies that stvg neutron star models admit heavier total masses than gr .",
    "the latter result is attractive because recent estimations of neutron star masses are defying gr limits .",
    "we incremented the parameter @xmath79 by an order of magnitude .",
    "distinctive local maxima and minima arose from the interchange between stvg gravitational repulsion and enhanced attraction .",
    "we consequently propose a more restrictive upper limit for the parameter @xmath10 than the one obtained from solar system observations .",
    "we conclude that , under certain simplifications , stvg entails admissible spherically symmetric and static solutions with matter sources .",
    "the corresponding modified tov equation serves to construct realistic stellar models with higher total masses than gr .",
    "density profiles with local minima and maxima are distinctive properties of stvg predictions .",
    "we expect novel predictions when taking rotation into account , like has already been done for teves and squared-@xmath82 gravity @xcite . in stvg , the presence of lorentz - like forces will manifest characteristic departures from other gravity theories .",
    "future work will be dedicated to efforts in that direction .",
    "furthermore , we will formally take into account the scalar fields contributions , and study stability and quasinormal modes of spherically symmetric solutions .",

    "<S> scalar - tensor - vector gravity ( stvg ) , also referred as modified gravity ( mog ) , is an alternative theory of the gravitational interaction . </S>",
    "<S> its weak field approximation has been successfully used to described solar system observations , galaxy rotation curves , dynamics of clusters of galaxies , and cosmological data , without the imposition of dark components . </S>",
    "<S> the theory was formulated by john moffat in 2006 . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we derive matter - sourced solutions of stvg and construct neutron star models . </S>",
    "<S> we aim at exploring stvg predictions about stellar structure in the strong gravity regime . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we represent spacetime with a static , spherically symmetric manifold , and model the stellar matter content with a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we then derive the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation in stvg and integrate it for different equations of state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that stvg allows heavier neutron stars than general relativity ( gr ) . </S>",
    "<S> maximum masses depend on a normalized parameter that quantifies the deviation from gr . </S>",
    "<S> the theory exhibits unusual predictions for extreme values of this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that stvg admits suitable spherically symmetric solutions with matter sources , relevant for stellar structure . </S>",
    "<S> since recent determinations of neutron stars masses violate some gr predictions , stvg appears as a viable candidate for a new gravity theory .    </S>",
