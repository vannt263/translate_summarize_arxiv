    "anderson localization is one of the most fundamental phenomena in the physics of disordered systems . being predicted in the seminal paper  @xcite for spin excitations , and then extended to electrons and other one - particle excitations in solids  @xcite and classical waves  @xcite , it became a paradigm of the modern physics  @xcite .",
    "the study of this phenomenon remains a hot topic throughout its more than 50-years history .",
    "it is constantly stimulated by new experimental results , including the most recent observations in microwaves  @xcite , optics  optics , segev , silberberg , and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "being a universal wave phenomenon , anderson localization has natural implications in novel exotic wave systems , such as photonic crystals , meta- and magnetooptical materials , graphene superlattices .",
    "indeed , left - handed metamaterials , nonlinear and magnetooptical materials , and graphene  veselago , pendry , shalaev , katsnelson2,geim , periodic-1,zvezdin are involved in design and engineering of various multilayered structures operating in a broad spectral range , from optical to microwave frequencies .",
    "random wave scattering and localization naturally appear in such systems , either due to technological imperfections or owing to the intentially designed random lattices .",
    "importantly , exotic properties of the constituent materials essentially require consideration of the interplay of the anderson localization with various additional effects : absorption and gain  @xcite , polarization and spin @xcite , nonlinearity nonlin - loc1,nonlin - loc2,silberberg , segev , shadrivov , and magnetooptical phenomena @xcite . in this review",
    ", we describe novel remarkable features of anderson localization of waves in multilayered structures composed of non - conventional materials with unique intrinsic properties .",
    "we start our review with sec .",
    "[ sec : multilay ] which introduces the basic concepts and general formalism describing the wave propagation , scattering , and localization in in random - layered media .",
    "anderson localization originates from the interference of multiply scattered waves , manifesting itself most profoundly in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems where all states become localized  @xcite . due to one - dimensional geometry ,",
    "such systems are well analyzed  @xcite , including the mathematical level of rigorousness of the results  @xcite .",
    "we describe the exact transfer - matrix approach to the wave propagation and scattering in layered media .",
    "the main spatial scale of localization , i.e. , _ localization length _ , can be defined in two ways : ( i ) via the lyapunov exponent of the random system and ( ii ) via the decrement of the wave transmission dependent on the system . in usual anderson - localization problems ,",
    "these two localization lengths coincide with each other .    in section  [ sec : meta ] we consider transmission and localization properties of the multilayered h - stacks comprised of normal materials with right - handed @xmath2layers and mixed m - stacks , including also left - handed @xmath3layers with negative refractive index  @xcite .",
    "the opposite signs of the phase and group velocities in metamaterials lead to partial or complete cancellation of the phase accumulation in multilayered m - stacks .",
    "we show that this cancellation suppresses the interference of multiple scattering waves and the localization itself  asatryan07,asatryan10a , asatryan10b , asatryan12 . using the weak scattering approximation ( wsa )  @xcite , we give detailed analytical and numerical description of transmission and localization properties of both m- and h - stacks and reveal a number of intriguing results .",
    "namely : ( i ) in the long wave limit localization lengths defined via the lyapunov exponent and transmission decrement differ from each other in m - stacks , ( ii ) there exist two ballistic regimes in the h - stacks , ( iii ) essential suppression of localization at special angles in the case of oblique incidence ( brewster anomaly ) and in the vicinity of special frequencies ( zero-@xmath4 or zero-@xmath5 frequencies ) is observed .",
    "finally , in section  [ subsec : enlight ] we discuss an anomalous enhancement  @xcite of wave transmission in minimally disordered alternated m - stacks of metamaterials , where the layer thicknesses are equal and only dielectric permittivities ( or only magnetic permeabilities ) vary .    section  [ sec : novel ] is devoted to the study of novel localization features in novel materials .",
    "we start with discussion of localization of light propagating through magneto - active multilayered structures , with either faraday or cotton - muton ( voigt ) geometries ( section  subsec : nonreciprocal ) .",
    "we show that magnetooptical effects can significantly affect the phase relations , resulting in nonreciprocal localization depending on direction of the wave propagation and polarization of light . at resonant frequencies corresponding to the excitation of localized states inside the sample , a nonreciprocal shift of the the resonance results in effectively unidirectional transmission of lightbliokh - mag . in section  [ subsec : graf ] , conducting properties of a graphene layer subject to stratified electric field are considered .",
    "the close analogy between charge transport in such system and wave transmission through multilayered stack  @xcite underpins remarkable conductive properties of disordered graphene@xcite .",
    "we predict disorder - induced resonances of the transmission coefficient at oblique incidence of electron waves .",
    "finally , in section  [ subsec : nonlin ] , we examine the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder in resonant transmission through a random - leyered dielectric medium  @xcite . owing to effective energy localization and pumping",
    ", even weak kerr nonlinearity can play a crucial role leading to bistability of anderson localized states inside the medium .",
    "akin to the magneto - optical structures , this brings about unidirectional transmission of light .",
    "as it was mentioned above , 1d anderson localization results is exponential decay of the transmission coefficient with the length @xmath6 of the sample . for multilayered systems , it worth to use the total number of layers @xmath7 and mean layer thickness @xmath8 .",
    "in what follows we use dimensionless variables measuring all lengths in mean layer thickness units while the time dependence is chosen in the form @xmath9 . for simplicity throughout all this review we mainly consider the lossless stacks .",
    "the detailed results concerning to the case of stacks with losses can be found in original works .",
    "introduce the dimensionless transmission length @xmath10 on a realization    @xmath11    and `` averaged '' @xmath7-dependent dimensionless transmission length @xmath12 of a multilayered @xmath13layered stack    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the stack amplitude transmission coefficient related to its transmittivity @xmath16 by equality @xmath17 due to self - averaging of @xmath18 , both these lengths @xmath19 and @xmath10 tend to the same limit    @xmath20    as the number @xmath7 of layers tends to infinity .",
    "following@xcite we recall @xmath21 as localization length .",
    "this localization length is related directly to the transmission properties .",
    "its reciprocal value is nothing but decrement of the stack transmission coefficient .",
    "transmission coefficient entering these equations is naturally expressed in terms of the total @xmath22-matrix of the stack written in the running wave basis .",
    "consider transmission of the plane wave incident normally from the left to the stack comprised of even number @xmath7 of layers and embedded into free space . in the simplest case ,",
    "the wave is described in terms of two component vector of , say , an electric field @xmath23 within a uniform medium with dielectric permittivity @xmath4 and magnetic permeability @xmath24 the field @xmath25 has the form    @xmath26    with @xmath27-axis directed to the right ( here and below all lengths of the problem are dimensionless and measured in the mean layer thickness ) .    if the components of vector @xmath28 are normalized by such a way that the energy flux of the wave ( [ field ] ) is @xmath29 then the amplitudes    @xmath30    of the field from both sides out of the @xmath13layer stack are related by its transfer matrix @xmath31    @xmath32    which is expressed via transmission and reflection coefficients of the stack as    @xmath33    where asterisk stands for the complex conjugation .",
    "the methods of calculation of transmission coefficient    @xmath34    are discussed in the next subsection .    in what follows",
    ", we consider stacks composed of weak scattering layers with reflection coefficients of each layer much smaller than @xmath35 in spite of this , for a sufficiently long stack the transmission coefficient is exponentially small @xmath36 with decrement coinciding with reciprocal localization length @xmath37 ( localized regime ) .",
    "however a short stack comprising a comparatively small number of layers is almost transparent @xmath38 ( ballistic regime ) . here",
    "the transmission length takes the form    @xmath39    involving the average reflectance @xcite .",
    "this follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ ll-0 ] ) by virtue of the current conservation relationship , @xmath40 .",
    "the length @xmath41 in this equation is termed the ballistic length .",
    "accordingly , in studies of the transport of the classical waves in one - dimensional random systems , the following spatial scales arise in a natural way :    * @xmath19  the _ transmission length _ of a finite sample ( [ ll-0 ] ) , * @xmath21  the _ localization length _ ( [ ll-3 ] ) related to transmission properties , and * @xmath41  _ ballistic length _ ( [ ll-21 ] ) .    the exponential decrease of transmission coefficient with the stack size is only manifestation of anderson localization . the phenomenon of localization itself is the localized character of eigenstates in infinite disordered system with sufficiently fast decaying correlations .",
    "the quantitative characteristic of such a localization is the lyapunov exponent which is increment of the exponential growth of the currentless state with a given value at certain point far from this point .",
    "the amplitude ( [ amplitudes ] ) of the currentless state in the inhomogeneous medium in the basis of running waves can be parameterized as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the modulus and the phase of the considered currentless solution correspondingly .",
    "it is known@xcite that at given initial values @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 , the function @xmath48 at a sufficiently far point is approximately proportional to its distance from the initial point . in discrete terms , with the probability @xmath49 the positive limit exists    @xmath50    which is called lyapunov exponent .",
    "its reciprocal value we also call localization length    @xmath51    however index @xmath52 reminds that this localization length is defined through lyapunov exponent .    to compare the two localization lengths @xmath21 and @xmath53",
    ", we consider first the continuous case were corresponding dynamical variable @xmath48 depends on continuous coordinate @xmath27 . in this case ,",
    "transmittance of the system with length @xmath6 is exactly expressed as@xcite    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two independent solutions satisfying so called cosine and sine initial conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 and having the same limiting behavior    @xmath59    equations ( [ transmittance-1 ] ) and ( [ limits ] ) evidently show that in continuous case @xmath21 and @xmath53 exactly coincide .    in the discrete case ( multilayered stack ) , corresponding expression for transmittance reads    @xmath60    here the last term in denominator differs from that in eq .",
    "( transmittance-1 ) .",
    "moreover , it can change its sign and generally speaking can essentially reduce the denominator itself thus enlarging transmittance and as a result enlarging localization length @xmath53 in compare to @xmath21 .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ transmittance-2 ] ) and ( [ lyapunov-1 ] ) enable us to state only that @xmath61 in contrast to the continuous case where these two localization lengths always coincide . in spite of that ,",
    "studying of localization in normal disordered multilayered stacks did not show any difference in the two lengths .",
    "we will see below that such a difference really manifests itself in the alternated metamaterial stacks .",
    "in this review we are mainly interested in the transmission length @xmath19 .",
    "this quantity can be found directly by standard transmission experiments . at the same time",
    ", it is sensitive to the size of the system and therefore is best suited to the description of the transmission properties in both the localized and ballistic regimes .",
    "more precisely , the transmission length coincides either with the localization length @xmath21 or with the ballistic length @xmath41 , respectively in the cases of comparatively long stacks ( localized regime ) or comparatively short stacks ( ballistic regime ) .",
    "that is ,    @xmath62      in this subsection we describe some methods used for calculation of transmission length and other transmission or / and localization characteristics in various regimes .",
    "all of them are based on various versions of transfer matrix approach .",
    "consider the m - stack alternatively comprised of even number @xmath7 of uniform layers labeled by index @xmath63 from right to left , so that all odd layers @xmath64 are of type `` @xmath65 '' and all even layers @xmath66 are of type `` @xmath67 '' , @xmath68 ( see fig .",

    "then the total transfer matrix factorizes to the product of @xmath77 transfer matrices of separate cells  asatryan07,izra09,imt-10,tim - fnt , mak-12 .",
    "parameterizing the transfer matrix of the @xmath69th layer by its transmission @xmath78 and reflection @xmath79 coefficients of a corresponding layer we obtain the recurrence relations    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are transmission and reflection coefficients of the reduced stack comprised of only @xmath83 first layers .",
    "these relations provide an _ exact _ description of the system and will be used later for direct numerical simulations of its transmission properties .",
    "another possible but less effective way is related to direct numeric calculation of the total transfer matrix ( [ product ] ) .    relations ( [ rec - t ] ) and ( [ rec - r ] ) serve as a starting point for the weak scattering approximation ( wsa ) elaborated in  @xcite and based on assumption that the reflection from a single layer is small _ i.e. _ , @xmath84 .",
    "this demand is definitely satisfied in the case of weak disorder . within wsa , instead of exact relations ( [ rec - t ] ) , ( [ rec - r ] )",
    "we use for the transmission length the following first order approximations    @xmath85    note that in deriving eq .",
    "( [ rec4 ] ) , we omit the first - order term @xmath86 this is uncontrolled action .",
    "the omitted term contributes only to the second order of @xmath87 already after the first iteration for not very large number of layers @xmath83 . for sufficiently large @xmath88",
    "it should be taken into account . nevertheless as we will see below",
    ", this approximation is excellent in all wavelength region .    neglecting the last term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rec3 ] ) we come to the so - called single - scattering approximation ( ssa ) , which implies that multi - pass reflections are neglected so that the total transmission coefficient is approximated by the product of the single layer transmission coefficients as well as total transmittance is approximated by the product of the single layer transmittances that results in    @xmath89    in the case of very long stacks ( _ i.e. _ , as the length @xmath90 ) , we can replace the arithmetic mean , @xmath91 on the other hand , in this limit the reciprocal of the transmission length coincides with the localization length . using the energy conservation law , @xmath92 , which applies in the absence of absorption , the reciprocal localization length in single - scattering approximation may be written as    @xmath93    and is proportional to the mean reflectance of a single random layer lgp , liansky-1995 .",
    "the version of transfer matrix approach described above is based on consideration of a single layer embedded into vacuum .",
    "this version and related wsa were used in  @xcite for analytical and numerical study of metamaterial m - stacks ( see section  sec : meta ) .    another version used in  @xcite ( section  [ subsec : nonreciprocal ] ) is based on a separation of wave propagation inside a layer and through the interface between layers ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "wave propagation inside the @xmath83-th layer is described by diagonal transfer matrix    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the phase accumulated upon the wave propagating from left to right through the @xmath83-th layer , and @xmath96 the interfaces are described by unimodular transfer matrices @xmath97 corresponding , respectively , to transitions ( all from left to right ) from vacuum to the medium ` @xmath65 ' , from the medium ` @xmath65 ' to the medium ` @xmath67 ' , from the medium ` @xmath67 ' to the medium ` @xmath65 ' , and from the medium ` @xmath65 ' to vacuum .",

    "its discrete version in slightly different terms ( see section [ subsec : enlight ] ) was obtained in @xcite .",
    "note that due to existence of the closed formula ( [ lyapunov-30 ] ) for lyapunov exponent , the task of analytical calculation of the localization length @xmath114 is a simpler problem than that of transmission length @xmath115 .",
    "the next steps are standard ( see _ e.g. _ refs .  [ ] ) : using ( [ layer - transf ] ) to get the dynamic equation for the phase @xmath113 , write down corresponding fokker - planck equation for its distribution , solve it and calculate the average ( [ lyapunov-30 ] ) . moreover , in weakly disordered systems , only the first and the second order terms should be accounted for in the dynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "for minimally disordered m - stacks defined in section  [ sec : intro ] , this program was successfully realized in  @xcite ( see section [ subsec : enlight ] below ) .",
    "over the past decade , the physical properties of metamaterials and their possible applications in modern optics and microelectronics , have received considerable attention ( see e.g. refs sok , bliokh , classification , shalaev ) .",
    "the reasons for such an interest are unique physical properties of metamaterials including their ability to overcome the diffraction limit  @xcite , potential role in cloaking  @xcite , suppression of spontaneous emission rate @xcite , the enhancement of quantum interference @xcite , etc .",
    "one of the first study of the effect of randomness  @xcite revealed that weak microscopic disorder may lead to a substantial suppression of the wave propagation through magnetic metamaterials over a wide frequency range .",
    "therefore the next problem was to study localization properties of disordered metamaterial systems .",
    "it was known that , in normal multilayered systems comprising right - handed media , the localization length is proportional to the square of wavelength @xmath116 in the long - wavelength limit , tends to a constant in a short - wavelength regime , and oscillates irregularly in the intermediate region  @xcite .",
    "natural question arises : how inclusion of metamaterial layers influences the localization and transmission effects .",
    "the study of localization in metamaterials was started in ref .",
    "[ ] where wave transmission through an alternating sequence of air layers and metamaterial layers of random thicknesses was studied .",
    "localized modes within the gap were observed and delocalized modes were revealed despite the one - dimensional nature of the model .",

    "it was shown that the spectrally averaged transmission in a frequency range around the fully transparent resonant mode decayed with the number of layers much more rapidly than in a homogeneous random slab .",

    "however in the particular case of normal incidence @xmath717 and equal impedances @xmath718 , the transmission of dirac electrons through a junction is similar to the transmission of light via an interface between two media with different refractive indices ( but equal impedances ) . such an interface is absolutely transparent to light and therefore both _",
    "p - n _ and _",
    "p - p _ junctions are absolutely transparent to the dirac electrons in graphene@xcite .",
    "this is related to the absence of backscattering and antilocalization of massless dirac fermions caused by their spin properties @xcite .",
    "this also explains klein paradox@xcite ( perfect transmission through a high potential barrier ) in graphene systems , and leads ( together with symmetry and spectral flow arguments ) to the surprising conclusion that dirac electrons are delocalized in disordered 1d graphene structure , providing a minimal non - zero overall transmission , which can not be destroyed by fluctuations , no matter how strong they are @xcite .",
    "however , this statement ( being correct in some sense ) should be perceived with a certain caution .",
    "indeed , many features of anderson localization can be found in random graphene systems .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that although the wave functions of normally incident ( @xmath719 ) particles are extended and belong to the continuous part of the spectrum , away from some vicinity of @xmath720 1-d random graphene systems manifest all features of disorder - induced strong localization .",
    "in particular , for a long enough , disordered graphene superlattice the transmission coefficient , @xmath22 , as a function of the angle of incidence , @xmath721 , ( or of the energy @xmath722 , if @xmath723 is fixed ) has typical for anderson localization shape , fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] .    along with continuous of typical angles ( or energies ) , for which the transmission is exponentially small , there exists a quasi - discrete random set of directions where the sample is well transparent , i.e. , the transmission coefficient is close to one . at these angles ,",
    "the wave functions are exponentially localized ( fig .  [ fg2 ] ) , with the lyapunov exponent ( inverse localization length @xmath724 ) being proportional to the strength of disorder .",
    "charge transport in a graphene sheet subjected to a disordered electrostatic potential is determined by the ratio between its values @xmath725 and the energy @xmath4 of the particle .",
    "in particular , in randomly - layered potential @xmath726 ( @xmath83 is the number of a layer , @xmath727 is a non - random function , @xmath728 are independent random variables homogeneously distributed in the interval @xmath729 $ ] ) it manifests essentially different features in the following three different systems @xcite :    \\(i ) @xmath730 , @xmath727 is a periodic function . in this case , a relatively weak disorder drastically changes the transmission spectrum .",
    "all features of the spectrum of the underlying periodic structure are washed out , and a rather dense ( quasi-)discrete angular spectrum appears , with the corresponding wave functions being localized at random points inside the sample ( disorder - induced resonances ) .",
    "however , there is one fundamental difference from the usual anderson localization : in the vicinity of normal incidence , the transmission spectrum of graphene is continuous with extended wave functions , and the transmission coefficient is finite ( @xmath731 at @xmath732 .",
    "it is this range of angles that provides the finite minimal conductivity , which is proportional to the integral of @xmath733 over all angles @xmath721 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath734under these conditions , the transmission of the unperturbed system is exponentially small ( tunneling ) and , rather unusually , gets enhanced by the fluctuation of the potential .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath735 , @xmath727 is a periodic set of numbers with alternating signs .",
    "the behavior of the charge carriers in the potential of this type is most unusual .",
    "it is characteristic of two - dimensional fermions and have no analogies in electron and light transport .",
    "the disorder obliterates the transmission peaks of the underlying periodic system , makes much wider the transparency zone around normal angle of incidence , and gives rise to a new narrow peak in the transmission coefficient , associated with wave localization in the random potential . unlike the peaks in the periodic structure",
    ", the wave function of this disorder - induced resonance is exponentially localized . in distinction to the case ( i ) , the transmission in ( iii ) is extremely sensitive to fluctuations of the applied potential : relative fluctuations @xmath736 reduce the angular width of the transmission spectrum more than four times .",
    "propagation of light in analogous l - r and r - r disordered dielectric structures demonstrates completely different behavior .",
    "as the degree of disorder ( variations of the refractive index ) grows , the averaged angular spectra quickly reach their asymptotic `` rectangular '' shape : a constant transmission in the region where all interfaces between layers are transparent followed by an abrupt decrease in transmission in the region of angles where the total internal reflection appears .",
    "recent renewed interest to anderson localization is driven by a series of experimental demonstrations in optics  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues risen in these studies is that the disordered systems can be inherently nonlinear , so that an intriguing interplay of nonlinearity and disorder could be studied experimentally .",
    "nonlinear interaction between the propagating waves and disorder can significantly change the interference effects , thus fundamentally affecting localization  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the studies of the localization in random nonlinear media deal with the ensemble - averaged characteristics of the field , such as the mean field and intensity , correlation functions , etc .",
    "these quantities describe the averaged , typical behavior of the field , but they do not contain information about individual localized modes ( resonances ) , which exist in the localized regime in each realization of the random sample soven , azbel , bbf , we - prl-1,topolancik . these modes are randomly located in both real space and frequency domain and are associated with the exponential concentration of energy and resonant tunneling .",
    "in contrast to regular resonant cavities , the anderson modes occur in a statistically - homogeneous media because of the interference of the multiply scattered random fields .",
    "although the disorder - induced resonances in linear random samples have been the subject of studies for decades , the resonance properties of nonlinear disordered media have not been explored so far .    in this section",
    "we present the study of the effect of nonlinearity on the anderson localized states in a one - dimensional random medium  @xcite . as a result of interplay of nonlinearity and disorder ,",

    ", weak nonlinearity has practically no effect on the averaged localization background .",

    "the main signature of the localization is an exponential decay of the wave intensity , @xmath743 , deep into the sample and , thus , an exponentially small transmission @xcite : @xmath744 . here @xmath6 is the length of the sample and @xmath21 is the localization length which is the only spatial scale of anderson localization .",

    "excitation of each localized mode inside the random sample can be associated with an effective resonator cavity located in the area of field localization and bounded by two potential barriers with exponentially small transparencies  @xcite . according to this model , the transmittance spectrum @xmath748 in the vicinity of a resonant wavelength for the case of weak nonlinearity ( @xmath749 )",

    "it is important to note that each disorder - induced resonance is associated with its own effective cavity , so that the disordered sample can be considered as a chain of randomly located coupled resonators  @xcite .",

    "one case of such nonreciprocical resonant transmission is shown in the panel ( a ) of fig.[bist_fig4 ] .",
    "we observe considerably different transmission properties in opposite directions with the maximal intensity contrast between two directions 7.5:1 .",
    "moreover , the threshold of the bistability is also significantly different for two directions : there is a range of incident powers , for which the wave incident from one side of the sample is bistable , while there is no signs of bistability for the incidence from the other side .",
    "figure  [ bist_fig4](b ) shows the pulse reshaping for incidence from opposite sides of the structure .    in this section",
    "we have presented the study of new manifestations of the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder .",
    "it is shown that even weak nonlinearity affect dramatically the resonant transmission associated with the excitation of the anderson localized states leading to bistability and nonreciprocity . despite random character of the appearance of anderson modes ,",
    "their behavior and evolution are rather deterministic , and , therefore , these modes can be used for efficient control of light similar to regular cavity modes .",
    "these results demonstrate that , unlike infinite systems , the anderson localization in finite samples is not destroyed by weak nonlinearity ",
    "instead it exhibits new intriguing features typical for resonant nonlinear systems .",
    "we have reviewed the transmission and localization wave properties of the complex disordered structures composed of ( i ) left - handed metamaterials , ( ii ) magneto - active optical materials , ( iii ) graphene superlattices , and ( iv ) nonlinear dielectric media",

    "remarkable phenomena appear , such as anti-(de-)localization , unidirectional transmission , slow - light propagation , and bistability .",
