    "iras 17423@xmath11755 ( hen 3@xmath11475 ) was first suggested by @xcite as a possible member of the transition phase from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) to the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage due to its unusual iras colors .",
    "the high values of the [ nii]/h@xmath5 ratios in the outflowing material detected by @xcite and the low luminosity deduced for the central star allowed them to confirm the classification of this object as an evolved star . _ hubble space telescope _",

    "observations by @xcite showed the presence of both oh maser emission and highly collimated ionized outflows like those detected in oh / ir stars or very young pn .",
    "_ hst _ images revealed a rich and complex morphological structure in the circumstellar material ( see section 4 for details ) .",
    "the outflow is collimated in bipolar jets along several condensations of shock - excited gas that extend about 11 arcsec .",
    "the lobes show expansion velocities of about 425 km s@xmath6 and a high velocity jet ( @xmath0900 km",
    "s@xmath6 ) in the inner part of the lobes @xcite . the nebula displays a remarkable point symmetry that has been interpreted as due to the precession of a central binary system that undergoes episodic events of mass loss .",
    "@xcite proposed that the expanding shell has a torus - like structure where the oh emission originates in a high density region , where h@xmath3o is dissociated and further collimated in the observed jets . additionally , @xcite found evidences of ultrafast winds ( up to 2300 km s@xmath6 ) highly collimated and located close to the central star which could be a relatively young post - agb outflow not strongly altered by interaction with the agb .",
    "stars at the end of the agb phase are characterized by severe mass loss ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 m@xmath9 yr@xmath6 ) , which results in the formation of circumstellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the envelopes of agb stars is translated into a variety of shapes in the pn phase by a mechanism or mechanisms not as yet well understood .",
    "there is increasing evidence that at least in some instances the shaping starts at the end of the agb phase @xcite .",
    "iras 17423@xmath11755 is a spectacular example that may represent a link between oh / ir stars with extreme outflows and highly bipolar pn .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of extreme ( e.g. , highly embedded ) oh / ir agb stars is characterized by the presence of strong and broad amorphous silicate absorption features at 9.7 and 18 @xmath2 m together with crystalline silicate absorption / emission features from 10 to 45 @xmath2 m @xcite . at the end of the agb phase , the crystalline silicate features become dominant and can be observed in more evolved o - rich pn @xcite .",

    "( _ iso _ ) observations of o - rich dust shells surrounding evolved stars with laboratory data suggested the presence of several families of crystalline silicates , such as olivines and pyroxenes , and marked the beginning of an emerging discipline : the mineralogy of stellar and other astronomical ( i.e. , cometary ) dust shells .",
    "water ice features at 3.1 , 43 , and 62 @xmath2 m have been additionally observed in heavily obscured and extremely bipolar sources such as the post - agb star iras 19343@xmath42926 ( or m1@xmath192 , see e.g. dijkstra et al .",

    "dusty models @xcite were fitted to optical , near- and far - infrared ( iras and _ iso _ ) photometry in order to reconstruct the seds and to derive physical parameters such as dust temperatures , mass loss rates , angular radii and the inner boundary of the dust envelopes . for the particular case of iras 17423@xmath11755",
    "they considered a combination of silicates and carbon in the circumstellar environment .",
    "they reported the presence of a broad absorption feature at 3.1 @xmath2 m that they identified as due to the presence of c@xmath3h@xmath3 and/or hcn in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this identification led these authors to infer a c - rich chemistry for the shell .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented observations of a sample of 26 hot post - agb stars with the infrared array camera and the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope_. these observations were analyzed together with two micron all sky survey , iras and radio centimeter data in order to model the seds of the targets .",
    "@xcite classified iras 17423@xmath11755 as a c - rich star on the basis of the @xcite report of the c@xmath3h@xmath3 feature at 3.1 @xmath2 m and in the absence of a strong 9.7 @xmath2 m amorphous silicate absorption / emission feature in their low - resolution ( r@xmath064@xmath1128 ) _ spitzer _ spectrum . however , they pointed out that the expected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features in the 512 @xmath2 m region are not detected .",

    "the detection of these c - rich molecular absorptions - typical of c - rich agb / post - agb stars - requires in most of the cases higher resolution observations such as those provided by the high - resolution modes of _ spitzer _ ( _ r_@xmath0600 ) and _ iso _ ( _ r_@xmath01000 ) ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    the controversial origin of the mid- to far - ir features in iras 17423@xmath11755 merits a re - analysis of the dust features observed in the high - resolution and higher quality _ spitzer _ spectrum . in section 2 we present the new _",

    "the post - bcd products ( one spectrum for each nod position ) automatically reduced by the irs custom extractor ( spice ) were retrieved from the _ spitzer _ database .",
    "the automatic data reduction includes the extraction from the 2-dimensional images as well as the wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "spitzer_-contributed software smart @xcite was used for cleaning residual bad pixels , spurious jumps and glitches and for smoothing and merging .",

    "we found a good match ( @xmath115% ) between the sl and sh module spectra .",

    "both sws and lws spectra were taken in the full scan aot1 mode @xcite at speed 1 .",
    "the data were processed using the standard interactive analysis software , version 7.0 of the sws and lws off - line processing system at the max planck institute for extraterrestrial astronomy ( garching , germany ) ; see @xcite for more details on the reduction procedure .",
    "all detector signals were inspected for spurious features , which were removed .",

    "the 3.1 @xmath2 m absorption band can be clearly observed in sws aot band 1d .",
    "no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the presence of any other solid - state dust feature because of the strong noise level in the _ iso _ spectrum .",
    "the contribution from galactic cirrus emission was estimated by irsky at the galactic coordinates of the nebula .",
    "it was fitted by polynomials and subtracted from the resulting _ iso _ spectra .",

    "another post - agb nebula sharing some observational properties with iras 17423@xmath11755 is iras 19343@xmath42926 ( m1@xmath192 ) , the minkowski footprint @xcite .",
    "both nebulae display similar morphological properties ( bipolarity ) , a comparable effective temperature for the central ( b - type ) star , host an oh maser and also present analogous infrared spectral distributions ( see also section 4 ) . in order to compare their infrared properties ,",
    "we have extracted the _ iso _ spectra for this source from the archive and performed a similar sws+lws reduction procedure as in the case of iras 17423@xmath11755 .",
    "the _ iso _ spectrum of iras 19343@xmath42926 is of much higher quality than that of iras 17423@xmath11755 .",
    "indeed , @xcite have previously classified the _ iso _ spectra of iras 17423@xmath11755 and iras 19343@xmath42926 with the classes 5.f : and 5.sa , respectively .",
    "this means that both spectra have red continua with the _ iso _ spectrum of iras 17423@xmath11755 displaying no strong features superimposed on the sed , and the _ iso _ spectrum of iras 19343@xmath42926 displaying a clear 10 @xmath2 m silicate absorption feature and classified as an o - rich source .",
    "objects in class 5.sa often also possess water ice , co and co@xmath3 features .",
    "additionally , the irs spectrum of the post - agb star iras 17393@xmath12727 @xcite , will also be considered for comparison with iras 17423@xmath11755 .",
    "we have constructed the seds of iras 17423@xmath11755 and iras 19343@xmath42926 in the spectral region from 2 to @xmath0180 @xmath2 m by using the irs _ spitzer _ data in the interval from 5 to 34 @xmath2 m and _ iso _ sws and lws in the remaining range .",
    "the _ iso _ data were smoothed to the resolution of _ spitzer _",

    "the resulting seds for both objects are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the overall seds of iras 17423@xmath11755 and iras 19343@xmath42926 peak between 40 and 60 @xmath2 m .",
    "notably , the absorption feature in the 2.5 - 3.5 @xmath2 m region appears strong in both objects , together with [ cii ] in emission at 158 @xmath2 m ; however , this latter feature might be galactic residual background emission .",
    "the @xmath02@xmath1180 @xmath2 m seds in figure 2 display a very cold bimodal continuum that can be interpreted in terms of thermal emission from the dust .",
    "obviously , it would correspond to several wavelength - dependent dust emissivities with a certain range of dust temperatures , but we found that two main components of the nebular dust , cold ( strong ) and hot ( weaker ) , could roughly reproduce the general trend of the observed overall energy distribution .",
    "we performed a multiple blackbody fitting using the iraf routine nlfit on the f@xmath13 over @xmath14 spectrum and obtained blackbody temperatures of 120 k and 965 k for iras 17423@xmath11755 ( in agreement with the values reported in @xcite ) and temperatures of 120 k and 965 k in the case of iras 17423@xmath11755 .",
    "the fitted blackbody curves are shown in the f@xmath15 over @xmath14 spectra of figure 2 , where we also detail the fitting in the region of the 3.1 @xmath2 m absorption feature . @xcite",
    "have recently reported difficulties in modeling the seds of heavily obscured o - rich post - agb stars by using a more sophisticated radiation transfer code for dusty environments such as dusty .",
    "they needed to add amorphous carbon dust in their dusty models in order to reproduce both the observed red continua and the apparently weak 10 @xmath2 m amorphous silicate absorption.1755 .",
    "this fact probably led these authors to identify the strong 3.1 @xmath2 m absorption band as due to c@xmath3h@xmath3 .",
    "] it is to be noted here that the inclusion of amorphous carbon grains in the dusty models of o - rich post - agb stars does not necessarily mean that these sources are c - rich ; their infrared spectra show o - rich dust features only .",
    "other more unusual o - rich dust species with optical properties similar to those of the amorphous carbon grains could be present in the circumstellar shells of heavily obscured o - rich post - agb stars ( see section 4 ) , also giving a good fit to the observed seds of these stars ( r. szczerba 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "these difficulties prevent us from proceeding further with this modeling , as the thermal continuum around 3 @xmath2 m was found to provide an adequate reference for the optical depth of the observed feature and we are mainly interested in the analysis of the dust features present in the new high - resolution _ spitzer _ spectrum .",
    "the most interesting and well - defined feature in the _ iso _ spectrum of iras 17423@xmath11755 is a clear absorption band at 3.1 @xmath2 m , which we identify for the first time as water ice ( see below ) present in the dust grains of the circumstellar material .",
    "similar detections are not very numerous , the comparison object being iras 19343@xmath42926 , a bipolar post - agb star with an o - rich composition , another case that has also been observed with _ iso_. the identification of this 3.1 @xmath2 m absorption feature as c@xmath3h@xmath3 by @xcite is erroneous , as the new high - resolution _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectrum confirms .",
    "figure 3 displays the sed of iras 17423@xmath11755 from 2 to @xmath016 @xmath2 m together with the comparison o - rich post - agb stars iras 19343@xmath42926 and iras 17393@xmath12727 .",
    "no other feature characteristic of a c - rich chemistry ( e.g. , sic , pahs , c@xmath3h@xmath3 , hcn ) in the circumstellar envelope can be found in the observed _ spitzer _ spectrum . in particular , there is no indication of the presence of c@xmath3h@xmath3 absorption at 13.7 @xmath2 m and the key point here is that the c@xmath3h@xmath3 ro - vibrational lines at @xmath03 and 14 @xmath2 m are of similar strength ( @xmath020 @xmath12 from the continuum ; see e.g. , cernicharo et al .",

    "a weak and broad 9.7 @xmath2 m absorption from amorphous silicates ( o - rich ) is present .",

    "they reported the presence of several weak crystalline silicate emission features in the 27 - 31 @xmath2 m region , and crystalline silicate absorption features at shorter wavelengths .",
    "in particular , an absorption feature at 15.4 @xmath2 m can be clearly observed in the irs spectrum of this star presented in figure 3 .",
    "such crystalline silicate absorption / emission features can not be claimed for definitely in either iras 17423@xmath11755 or iras 19343@xmath42926 at the s / n level of our _ spitzer_/irs spectra .",
    "it is worth noticing here that these weak crystalline silicate features have been observed in the circumstellar envelopes of o - rich evolved stars with a variety of strengths and at slightly different wavelengths from source to source , depending on the specific chemical composition and the size and density of the dust grains in the circumstellar envelope @xcite .    our identification at 3.1 @xmath2 m of water ice and the weak 9.7 @xmath2",

    "in addition , [ neii ] nebular emission at 12.8 @xmath2 m is also detected for the three objects shown in this figure , suggesting that the ionization of the circumstellar material may have already started in these evolved stars .",
    "the conditions for condensation and properties of amorphous and crystalline h@xmath3o ice in astrophysical environments have been extensively reviewed by several authors @xcite .",
    "different forms of water ice can be observed , depending mainly on temperature , pressure and the mechanisms of deposition . for typical low pressure conditions present in the circumstellar envelopes ,",
    "temperatures higher than 150170 k produce hexagonal ice , which remains stable during further cooling . if deposition takes place at lower temperatures ( between 110 and 130 k ) cubic ice is formed , while at temperatures lower than 100130 k the resulting ice is amorphous @xcite .    in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars",
    "water ice can condense forming icy mantles on dust grains which have previously condensed while the gas cooled down in the expanding envelopes . in o - rich envelopes all the carbon atoms",
    "are thought to be locked in co molecules and the remaining o atoms are supposed to form h@xmath3o aggregates . determining the occurrence and characterization of water ice features is interesting because ice in these mantles can provide important diagnostics of the physical conditions in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "water ice has been observed in a significant sample of agb stars - in particular in oh / ir stars - some post - agb stars and a few pn @xcite .",
    "the specific conditions for the formation of water ice in circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars have been discussed and modeled by dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 ) , who also studied the trends that can be observed in the 3 , 43 and 62 @xmath2 m water ice features during the stellar evolution from the agb to the pn phase .",
    "according to @xcite it continues to be a puzzle why some stars form water ice and not others .",
    "one clue these authors found might be the fact that the strength of the 3 , 43 and 62 @xmath2 m water ice features increases with the increasing initial mass of the star .",
    "their model calculations suggest that water ice features will be too weak to be detectable for stars with zero age main sequence ( zams ) masses lower than 5 m@xmath9 ; the water ice features completely disappear for initial masses lower than @xmath0 3 m@xmath9 .",
    "a high mass loss rate also favors the detectability of the water ice features , as well as large values of the mass loss rate to luminosity ratio .",
    "the absence of a strong interstellar uv radiation field also preserves ices , as well as the presence of a high density region that can provide shielding from an energetic radiation field .",
    "both crystalline and amorphous water ice can form in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the models developed by @xcite show that the shape of the spectral features is very sensitive to the type of water ice aggregate formed .",
    "the 3.1 @xmath2 m crystalline water ice absorption feature is characterized by a sharp core with two unequally strong shoulders . on the other hand , the amorphous water ice absorption feature is broader , with no substructures , and displaced to shorter wavelengths . in the 30100 @xmath2 m region",
    "crystalline water ice shows two prominent and very broad emission features near 43 and 62 @xmath2 m . in the case of amorphous water ice ,",
    "these latter features are undetectable because they are broad and show almost no contrast with the dust continuum .",
    "figure 4 details the 3.1 @xmath2 m water ice band in iras 17423@xmath11755 and in iras 19343@xmath42926 . in both cases",
    "the band presents a sharp profile and shows the characteristic shoulders on both sides of the central core , indicating that most of the water ice formed must be crystalline .",
    "this is demonstrated by the good match that can be appreciated among the observed profiles and the model displayed in the figure , calculated for crystalline water ice deposited at a dust excitation temperature of 150 k by @xcite .",
    "additionally , the _ iso _ spectrum of iras 19343@xmath42926 shows the presence of the water ice bands at 62 and 43 @xmath2 m @xcite , confirming the crystalline nature of the water ice in this star .",
    "the presence of these latter features can not be excluded in the case of iras 17423@xmath11755 because of the poor quality of the _ iso _ lws spectrum ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "a much higher s / n spectrum would be needed in order to confirm / discard the detection of the crystalline water ice features at the longer wavelengths .",
    "the water ice features are providing us with valuable information for interpreting the precise evolutionary stage of these nebulae .",
    "this point will be addressed in section 4 together with the analysis of other observational properties such as the nebular morphology and the presence of amorphous silicates .",
    "the available _ hst _ optical images for iras 17423@xmath11755 ( bobrowsky et al . 1995 ) and iras 19343@xmath42926 @xcite were retrieved from the _ hst _ archive in order to compare the morphological properties of both objects .",

    "the models by @xcite discussed in section 3.2 have shown that the conditions for the formation and prevalence of crystalline water ices , like those observed in iras 17423@xmath11755 and iras 19343@xmath42926 , would imply high initial masses ( at least higher than @xmath03 m@xmath9 ) for the central star and the probable presence of high density structures such as a dusty disk or torus , which could completely obscure the central star in the optical / near - ir wavelength range .",
    "the existence of such dusty disk / torus structures is confirmed in the optical images of both objects . @xcite",
    "have proposed that heavily obscured high - mass precursors of pn like iras 17393@xmath12727 may be already developing strong bipolar outflows , and it is likely that a thick circumstellar disk / torus - where the crystallization of water ice could take place - is surrounding the central post - agb star .",
    "the presence of a highly collimated bipolar outflow as well as a thick circumstellar disk / torus that completely obscures the central source in iras 17393@xmath12727 is now confirmed by the available _ hst _ images shown in figure 5 .",
    "@xcite used the _ iso _ spectra of a sample of oh / ir stars to analyze the ir characteristics of their circumstellar dust .",
    "they found that the optical depth of the @xmath010 and 18 @xmath2 m amorphous silicate features increases with increasing mass loss rate during the agb .. the same results were found by @xcite , who modeled the evolution of the 2200 @xmath2 m sed for a 5 m@xmath9 ( zams ) star evolving from the early agb until the early pn stage . at the end of the agb ,",
    "the circumstellar envelope detaches from the star , becoming optically thin and causing the amorphous silicate features to disappear . this infrared evolutionary sequence from the agb to the pn stage has been observationally confirmed by @xcite using _ spitzer _ spectra of massive o - rich agb / post - agb stars .",
    "regarding the evolutionary state of iras 17423@xmath11755 , it is likely that this star is more evolved than iras 19343@xmath42926 because the amorphous silicate absorption and the water ice band are weaker @xcite .",
    "iras 17393@xmath12727 could be the least evolved object of the three because it has no optical / near - ir counterpart ( the central star is not detected even in the k - band ) .",
    "however , in the case of iras 19343@xmath42926 and iras 17423@xmath11755 , the central star has already reappeared in the optical / near - ir range .",
    "the presence of [ neii ] nebular emission could provide evidence on the onset of the circumstellar envelope ionization , although shock excitation in the high velocity outflows can not be excluded .    the sed of iras 17423@xmath11755 is similar to those of extreme oh / ir agb stars , which exhibit absorption features from amorphous silicates together with crystalline silicate features that alternate between emission and absorption depending on the specific physical and chemical properties of the circumstellar dust grains @xcite .",
    "we think that the presence of crystalline silicates in the 13 - 35 @xmath2 m region in iras 17423@xmath11755 and iras 19343@xmath42926 can not be excluded but that higher s / n spectra would be needed in order to confirm or discard such a presence .    in summary , the bipolar morphology ,",
    "the detection of oh maser emission and crystalline water ice as well as the 9.7 @xmath2 m absorption from amorphous silicates present in the _ spitzer _ spectrum indicate that iras 17423@xmath11755 is a massive o - rich post - agb star similar to iras 19343@xmath42926 and iras 17393@xmath12727 .",

    "this result is based on the detection of a weak and broad 9.7 @xmath2 m amorphous silicate absorption in the high - resolution _ spitzer_/irs spectrum .",
    "the complete lack of c - rich mid - ir features ( in particular c@xmath3h@xmath3 at 13.7 @xmath2 m ) supports our identification of the strong 3.1 @xmath2 m absorption band seen in the _ iso _ spectrum as due to water ice as well as our o - rich classification for iras 17423@xmath11755 .",
    "iras 17423@xmath11755 , iras 19343@xmath42926 and iras 17393@xmath12727 present clear evidences of the presence of a circumstellar disk or torus , where the conditions would be very similar to those found in less evolved and more embedded oh / ir stars . a recent strong mass - loss event has been reported in the case of iras 19343@xmath42926 @xcite , which would favor this scenario .",
    "water ice and crystalline silicates would preferentially form in the outer region of the inner torus , where low temperature conditions and shielding from the central star would allow a favorable rate of crystallization to take place .",
    "both in iras 17423@xmath11755 and iras 19343@xmath42926 , the ice band at 3.1 @xmath2 m is sharp and presents substructures , and comparison with models of water ice growth around evolved stars @xcite allows us to confirm that the ice is mostly in a crystalline state .    the morphological properties , detection of oh maser emission , and the _ spitzer_/irs spectra observed in iras 17423@xmath11755 are similar to those of the o - rich post - agb stars iras 19343@xmath42926 and iras 17393@xmath12727 , allowing us to interpret the evolutionary stage of iras 17423@xmath11755 as belonging to an intermediate stage between those oh / ir stars with extreme outflows and highly bipolar type i pn .",
