    "is widely adopted in the literature , although cernis ( @xcite ) proposes 200pc .",
    "early optical spectroscopic studies show that the hh7 - 11 outflow has a complex velocity field and low excitation ( solf & bhm  @xcite ; bhm & solf  @xcite ) , a conclusion further supported by near infrared studies ( hartigan et al .",
    "@xcite ; carr  @xcite ) .",
    "early on , a well defined co bipolar outflow was detected associated with this system ( snell & edwards  @xcite ; bachiller & cernicharo  @xcite ) , which also is observed in some other molecules like hco@xmath12 and h@xmath1o ( mehringer  @xcite ; cernicharo et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the hh7 - 11 outflow has an unusual morphology ; the blue outflow lobe is made up of an arc - shaped chain of knots , while the red one is invisible at optical wavelengths .",
    "the red lobe is , however , detected in the ( 1 - 0)s(1 ) h@xmath1  line at 2.12@xmath0 m  having a very ragged appearance ( see fig  [ map ] ) .",
    "both lobes have a total extension of @xmath13 2@xmath14 .",
    "it has been thought that the driving source of the outflow is the infrared star svs13 ( strom et al .",

    "@xcite ) at 1.3 and 3.5 mm with better than @xmath18 resolution , however , have not confirmed this .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the reasons why the hh7 - 11 flow has been so intensively studied ( see e.g. reipurth  @xcite ) , is that it was the first system showing clear signatures of a high velocity outflow in both neutral and molecular gas tracers ( lizano et al .",

    "this was a major step forward in the interpretation of molecular outflows as being driven by faster but more tenuous ( than the outflow entrained gas ) atomic stellar winds ( masson & chernin  @xcite ; raga et al .",
    "this has led to a more careful analysis of the energetics and shock conditions associated with the ionic / atomic and molecular gas outflows ( raga  @xcite ) .",

    ", we need to determine the fraction of [ oi]63@xmath0 m  emission due to other hh objects falling within the lws beam .",
    "the lws beam centered on hh7 also contains hh8 , 9 and 10 ; since the excitation conditions for the different hh objects along the flow do not show dramatic variations ( hartigan , curiel & raymond  @xcite ) , we choose to use the detected [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m  lines toward hh7 and hh10 as weights to estimate the [ oi]63@xmath0 m  cooling intrinsic to hh7 .",
    "we conservatively assign to hh8 and hh9 the same [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m  flux measured toward hh7 , and we also consider that the weighting of the lws beam profile decreases the contribution of hh8 - 9 and hh10 to the [ oi]63@xmath0mmeasured on the hh7 pointing by 10% and 50% , respectively .",
    "similar estimates can be done for the svs13 pointing , where again hh10 contributes at a 50% level .",
    "the hh11 s contribution does not need to be disentangled since it also contributes to the [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m  line of svs13 .",
    "no correction is required for the rl1 + 2 pointing . taking the above into account , we obtain [ oi]63@xmath0m/[siii]34.8@xmath0 m  line ratios between 15 and 20 , suggesting a pre - shock density @xmath5 @xmath6  ( hm89 ) .",
    "the models can also reproduce the absolute fluxes , provided that the emission solid angles are @xmath8 5@xmath17  in diameter with filling factor of 1 ; more intense oi and siii lines on the central position are likely due to slightly larger solid angles and/or filling factors .",
    "as concerns molecular cooling the main contribution to h@xmath1  emission in j - shocks is predicted ( hm89 ) to come from material excited by fuv or h@xmath1-formation pumping .",
    "indeed , fernandes & brand ( @xcite ) propose a fluorescent origin for the near - ir h@xmath1  lines toward hh7 .",
    "for the ( 0 - 0)s lines however , the predicted line ratios are not reproduced by the observations . in particular the s(7 )",
    "line , which is predicted to be always brighter than the s(5 ) line irrespectively of pre - shock density and shock velocity , is not detected at all in our sws spectra .      when interpreted in terms of non - dissociative shock",
    ", the pure rotational h@xmath1  lines provides a sensitive probe for the shock velocity , given the four orders of magnitudes of dynamical range spanned by their line ratios .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ h2_diagc ] , which presents the observed h@xmath1  line ratios superimposed on a grid of c - shock models from kaufman & neufeld ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations seem to place quite stringent boundaries to the shock velocity , @xmath54 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding gas temperature , @xmath55 k ( kaufman & neufeld  @xcite ) , is in good agreement with the values derived using simple lte analysis ( sect .",
    "[ molecules ] ) , as expected since the molecular gas is collisionally heated by the c - shock front . observed absolute fluxes can also be reproduced by the model as long as the emission solid angle does not exceed few arcsecs in diameter .",
    "we note that such a low velocity shock would also produce very faint s(6 ) and s(7 ) lines .",
    "once the shock velocity is determined , we can use the co / h@xmath1  cooling ratio to estimate the pre - shock density .",
    "[ ccoh2ratio ] presents such a diagnostic diagram .",
    "the co line fluxes in the three lws pointings should be corrected for contamination by the other hh objects . in similar way as for the [ oi]63@xmath0m/[siii]34.8@xmath0 m  ratio , we use the h@xmath1  coolings in different positions as weights to split the individual contributions to the co cooling .",
    "the corrected cooling ratios are reported as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ ccoh2ratio ] .",
    "we see that a shock velocity @xmath54 km s@xmath4  would correspond to a pre - shock densities of @xmath56 @xmath6  for hh7 and rl1 + 2 , and @xmath57 @xmath6  for svs13 .",
    "water is an important diagnostic for c - shock models .",
    "cooling is a fast function of the shock velocity since free atomic oxygen in the post - shock gas is expected to be incorporated into water as soon as the temperature rises above @xmath58 k , roughly corresponding to @xmath59 km s@xmath4  ( draine , roberge & dalgarno  @xcite , kaufman & neufeld  @xcite ) . in our case then , where the temperature is @xmath8600 k , cooling via h@xmath1o rotational transitions is expected to be dominant with respect to that of co. instead , the diagnostic diagram in fig .  [ ccoh2oratio ] shows that the observed co / h@xmath1o  cooling ratio is consistent with shock velocities @xmath60 km s@xmath4 , which can not justify the observed h@xmath1  temperatures .",
    "this suggests that most of the expected gas phase water is missing .",
    "we will propose an explanation for this result in sect .",
    "we have shown that hh7 - 11 is a complex region where different line emission mechanisms are simultaneously at work .",
    "notwithstanding the poor spatial resolution of our data , the variety of different spectral signatures detected allow us to draw the following physical scenario of the region .",
    "starting from hh7 , the c - shock conditions diagnosed by the molecular emission clearly require the presence of a magnetic field @xmath61@xmath62@xmath63  ( draine  @xcite ) , where @xmath63  is the shock velocity of the c component . assuming the standard scaling law ( draine  @xcite ) for the value of @xmath7    @xmath64    where @xmath65 in the interstellar medium , the estimated @xmath66@xmath6  pre - shock density for the c - shock component on hh7 gives @xmath7@xmath67@xmath0 g .",
    "variations of a factor 3 in each direction are nevertheless possible , since @xmath68 can vary between 0.3 and 3 in molecular clouds ( hm89 ) . for similar @xmath7  and @xmath69 , draine , roberge & dalgarno ( @xcite ) have shown that the c@xmath53j transition occurs at @xmath2@xmath850 km s@xmath4 , similar to the upper limit set on @xmath70  ( the j - shock velocity ) by our observations .",
    "this means that a significant @xmath61  component transverse to @xmath71  would smooth the shock front to a c type or , equivalently , that our observed j - shock component can only exist as long as @xmath71@xmath72@xmath61 . when the bowshock - like morphology of hh7 is also considered , as revealed by hst nicmos 2.12@xmath0 m  images ( a. cotera , priv .",
    ", then a very simple scenario emerges where hh7 is immersed in a @xmath61  roughly parallel to the flow axis . at the tip of the bow",
    "@xmath73@xmath74@xmath61  and j - shock conditions are present ; [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m  and most of [ oi]63@xmath0 m  flux arise from this region , and favourable conditions also exist to originate the `` hot '' , t@xmath75 k , h@xmath1  emission detected by gredel ( @xcite ) . along the sides of the bow , @xmath73  becomes nearly perpendicular to @xmath61 , creating favourable conditions for c - type shocks .",
    "this picture also provides a plausible explanation to the problem of the missing water : the water is actually produced in the c - shocks , but rapidly condenses onto dust grains and disappears from the gas - phase . this possibility is suggested by the recent discovery with iso - lws ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) of crystalline water ice toward hh7 .",
    "the deduced water abundance ( in solid state form ) is comparable to the interstellar oxygen abundance , which is what the models would predict for gas - phase water in c - shocks ; furthermore , the fact that the ice is in crystalline form requires grain temperatures of the order of 100 k , only attainable in dissociative shocks ( hm89 ; draine , roberge & dalgarno  @xcite ) .",
    "after being heated , the grains would be efficiently transported in the post c - shock regions along the * b *  lines , directed parallel to the flow . for the gas parameters we derived ,",
    "the grains are efficiently coupled to the magnetic field and are not significantly decelerated by collisions with the neutrals ( draine , roberge & dalgarno  @xcite ) .      from the viewpoint of the line emission properties , hh10 and hh7 appear very similar objects .",
    "although no lws data were specifically collected toward hh10 , the h@xmath1  and the [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m  lines still argue in favour of a dual j+c shock nature . from the morphological point of view , hh10 appears as an irregular blob in the 2.12@xmath0 m  image of fig .",
    "higher spatial resolution images in h@xmath19  and [ sii]6717 + 31from hst ( unpublished archival data ) resolved hh10 into a double filamentary structure whose n - s orientation does not appear to be related to the flow direction . however , the h@xmath19/[sii]6717 + 31  emission ratio is higher in the nw part of this hh object , facing toward svs13 .",
    "a higher ratio implies higher excitation ( stronger shocks ) conditions , which are likely to be traced by the [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m  line and by the ` hot ' , t@xmath76 k , h@xmath1  component ( gredel @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath61   maintains its direction downstream along the flow , as suggested for hh7 ( see above ) , then we speculate that the morphology of hh10 could correspond to irregularities or corrugations in the shocked walls of the cavity which is excavated by the flow .",
    "such irregularities might originate from instabilities at the flow - cavity interface , as proposed by liseau , sandell & knee ( @xcite ) , although there are no detailed numerical simulations of the process .",
    "the interpretation for hh11 and svs13 is more complicated because both sources are contained in the fields of view of the sws and lws instruments",
    ". pre - shock densities @xmath10 @xmath6  are here found for the c component ; this is a factor ten higher than in the other positions of the flow , which is not surprising given the close proximity of the origin of the flow .",
    "in these conditions the magnitude of the magnetic field ( eq .  [ magnetic ] ) could range from @xmath77@xmath0 g  to @xmath81 mg .",
    "such high @xmath7  values have been claimed by hartigan , curiel & raymond ( @xcite ) to justify the relative faintness of hh11 in 2.12@xmath0 m  h@xmath1  images ( see also fig .  [ map ] ) .",
    "the possibility that fir line emission toward svs13 arises in a collapsing envelope around is not relevant here because the predicted [ oi]63@xmath0 m  line flux ( ceccarelli , hollenbach & tielens  @xcite ) is about 30 times lower than actually observed , while co and h@xmath1o  lines are below the detection limit for the present observations .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that a fraction of the line fluxes measured with the lws originates from the recently discovered embedded outflow source svs13b ( bachiller et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "[ oi]63@xmath0 m , [ oi]145@xmath0 m  and [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m , together with a complement of h@xmath1  and co lines , have been detected toward the receding lobe , and define shock conditions which are not dramatically different from those present on the blue lobe .",
    "it is well known that no optical emission is detected toward the red lobe , and also published images in the h@xmath1  2.12@xmath0 m   line ( fig .",
    "[ map ] , garden et al .",
    "@xcite , hodapp & ladd  @xcite ) clearly show fainter emission there .",
    "higher values of dust extinction with respect to the blue lobe have been invoked as an explanation for this asymmetry .",
    "our observations , which trace similar shock conditions for the two lobes , tend to support this possibility .",
    "if j - shocks between stellar winds and ambient material are responsible for the acceleration of the molecular outflow , a correlation ( hollenbach  @xcite ) is expected between the outflow mass loss rate and the flux of the [ oi]63@xmath0 m  line , which is the dominant coolant in such shocks .",
    "the predicted mass loss rate , based on the observed [ oi]63@xmath0mcooling from hh7 , is @xmath78 @xmath79 yr@xmath4  ( see also cohen et al .",

    "spectral signatures of c and j shocks are ubiquitously found along the hh7 - 11 flow and its red - shifted counterpart .",

    "3 .   there is indirect evidence for an ordered * b *  field oriented parallel to the direction of the flow .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field is @xmath7@xmath67@xmath0 g  on the lobes , increasing to @xmath77@xmath0 g   at the position of the flow origin ; these figures , however , can vary of a factor 3 in each direction .",
    "the gas - phase in the post c - shock region is deficient in h@xmath1o .",
    "we presented evidence that this may be due to freezing onto warm grains processed through the j - shock front and traveling downstream along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the asymmetry in optical and nir properties among the two lobes of the outflow is probably not caused by different pre - shock densities or shock velocities , supporting the hypothesis of higher extinction values toward the red lobe .",

    "<S> we have used the two spectrometers on the infrared space observatory to observe the hh7 - 11 flow , its red - shifted counterpart , and the candidate exciting source svs13 , in the star formation region ngc1333 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect atomic ( [ oi]63@xmath0 m , [ oi]145@xmath0 m , [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m , [ cii]158@xmath0 m ) and molecular ( h@xmath1 , co , h@xmath1o ) lines at various positions along the bipolar flow .    most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock - excited emission . in particular , our analysis shows that dissociative ( j - type ) and non - dissociative ( c - type ) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere along both lobes of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the low - excitation nature of the herbig - haro nebulosities , with shock velocities @xmath2@xmath3 km s@xmath4 . toward both lobes of the outflow we find pre - shock densities of @xmath5 @xmath6  for both the j and c components , implying @xmath7@xmath8100@xmath0 g  for @xmath7@xmath9 . in the central region of the flow , close to the exciting source , </S>",
    "<S> the pre - shock density deduced for the c - shock component is @xmath10@xmath6 , suggesting a magnetic field @xmath83 times stronger . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the deficiency of gas - phase water in the post c - shock regions is due to freezing onto warm grains processed through the j - shock front and traveling along the magnetic field lines . </S>",
    "<S> the total observed cooling from the dissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slow molecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral hi wind .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears to be weakly photo - ionised by bd + 30@xmath11549 , the dominant illuminating source of the ngc1333 reflection nebula . </S>"
