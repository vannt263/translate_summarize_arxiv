    "in addition , the @xmath0 coupling can be directly measured in the decay @xmath28 and thus provides one more independent test of the sum rule approach .",
    "calculations of couplings of heavy mesons to a pion have already been undertaken several times in the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "unfortunately , the sum rules obtained in refs . [ 10 - 13 ] differ in nonleading terms and , to some extent , also in numerical results . here , we suggest an alternative method known as qcd sum rules on the light - cone . in this approach , the ideas of duality and matching between parton and hadron descriptions , intrinsic to the qcd sum rules , are combined with the specific operator product expansion ( ope ) techniques used to study hard exclusive processes in qcd @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional sum rules based on the wilson ope of the t - product of currents at small distances , one considers expansions near the light - cone in terms of nonlocal operators , the matrix elements of which define hadron wave functions of increasing twist . as one advantage",

    "the light - cone sum rule for the coupling of heavy mesons to a pion is the principal result of the present paper which is organized as follows . in sect .  2 we discuss possible strategies in constructing sum rules for coupling constants and explain the concept of light - cone sum rules .",

    "4 is devoted to a detailed numerical analysis . in sect .",
    "5 we show that in a simplified case , putting the external momenta in the correlation function equal to each other and performing a borel transformation in one momentum instead of two , we obtain the sum rule proposed previously in refs .",

    "there are several reasons for that : the different lorentz decompositions ( [ 220 ] ) and ( [ choice ] ) of the correlation function ( [ 19 ] ) , the differences between the sum rule ( [ fin ] ) and the soft - pion limit ( [ 48 ] ) of it , the different regions of the borel parameter @xmath125 , and the different values used for the decay constants @xmath250 and @xmath251 . in fact , as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the couplings shrink with @xmath125 .",
    "however , given the reliability criteria , generally accepted for sum rules , we see no possibility to shift @xmath125 to larger values beyond the regions considered in this paper , in contrast to ref .",
    "secondly , we find it inconsistent to include the perturbative gluon correction in the estimates of @xmath252 and @xmath253 , since they are not included in the sum rule for the combination of couplings @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",

    "we have argued in favour of the sum rule approach .",
    "moreover , writing a heavy quark expansion for the couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 we have determined the expansion coefficients , in particular , the leading @xmath260 correction .",
