    "the suppression of oscillation is an important topic of research in the context of coupled oscillators and has been studied in diverse fields such as physics , biology , and engineering @xcite .",
    "two distinct types of oscillation quenching processes are there , namely amplitude death ( ad ) and oscillation death ( od ) .",
    "the ad state is defined as a stable homogeneous steady state ( hss ) that arises in coupled oscillators under some parametric conditions @xcite,@xcite ; in the case of ad , oscillation is suppressed as all the coupled oscillators attain a common steady state that was unstable in the uncoupled condition . in the case of od , oscillators populate coupling dependent stable inhomogeneous steady states ( ihss ) that are resulted from the symmetry breaking bifurcation ; e.g. , in the case of two coupled oscillators , in the od state oscillation is suppressed and they attain two different newly created coupling dependent steady states . in the phase space od may coexist with limit cycle oscillation . while ad is observed and characterized as a control mechanism to suppress oscillation in laser application @xcite , neuronal systems @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , etc .",
    ", the od on the other hand is relevant in many biological and physical systems such as synthetic genetic oscillator @xcite , neural network @xcite , laser systems @xcite , etc ( see @xcite for an elaborate review on od ) .    in the earlier works on oscillation suppression , no clear distinction between ad and od was emphasized until the pioneering research by @xcite , where it was shown that the ad and od are two dynamically different phenomena , both from their origin and manifestation . @xcite",
    "observed od in genetic network under phase - repulsive coupling with realistic biological parameters and proved its importance in biological network .",
    "later , it has been reported that most of the coupling schemes , which were believed to induce ad only can induce od , also : ref.@xcite proved that the dynamic and conjugate coupling can induce od ; refs . @xcite and @xcite reported the occurrence of od induced by mean - field and repulsive coupling , respectively .",
    "more significantly , refs .",
    "@xcite show that these coupling schemes can induce an important transition phenomenon , namely the transition from ad to od that resembles the turing - type bifurcation in spatially extended systems , which is believed to have connection with the phenomenon of cellular differentiation @xcite .",
    "further , in the recent studies new oscillation quenching state @xcite and also new routes to oscillation quenching states @xcite are reported .",
    "more recently , in ref .  @xcite the important rigorous conditions for the onset of ad and od in a system of identical stuart - landau oscillators has been reported .",
    "thus , search for the transitions between different oscillation quenching states and identification of new oscillation quenching phenomena are an active area of recent research on coupled oscillators .    in this paper",
    "we report the occurrence of the ad to od transition and a new transition from ad to a novel nontrivial amplitude death ( nad ) state induced by the simultaneous presence of diffusive coupling ( i.e. direct coupling ) and environmental coupling ( i.e. indirect coupling ) . to the best of our knowledge , the ad to nad transition has not been observed earlier for any other coupling configuration .",
    "this direct - indirect coupling scheme was originally proposed by @xcite as a general scheme for inducing ad in coupled oscillators ( later extended for a network of oscillators @xcite ) , and attracts immediate attention due to its ease of implementation and generality to induce ad in any synchronizable units .",
    "although diffusive coupling is widely studied in the context of synchronization but environmental coupling is a less explored topic ; it is particularly important in biological systems , e.g. , populations of cells in which oscillatory reactions are taking place interact with each other via chemicals that diffuse in the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "since the authors of ref.@xcite rely mainly on time integration of the dynamical equations and linear stability analysis , thus the complete dynamical features induced by this coupling scheme were not explored and only the ad state was identified and characterized there .    in the present paper we employ a detailed bifurcation analysis to show that apart from ad , which actually occurs in a small zone of parameter space , there exists diverse oscillation suppression states , namely od and a newly observed nontrivial ad ( nad ) state .",
    "this nad state has not only a nonzero homogeneous steady state but , more significantly , in this state the system becomes _ bistable _ ( will be elaborated later in this paper ) .",
    "we explore the properties of the nad state and identify three distinct routes to nad .",
    "more importantly , we recognize different transition scenarios , e.g. ad to od transition , and a novel transition from ad to nad state .",
    "the importance of this ad - nad transition lies in the fact that it gives the evidence of _ direct transition _ from the mono - stability ( ad ) to bistability ( nad ) in dynamical system that may improve our understanding of the origin of bistability arises in biological processes @xcite@xcite . in this study",
    "we choose the paradigmatic stuart - landau and van der pol oscillators and derive the range of coupling parameters where the transitions are occurred",
    ". finally , we report the first experimental evidence of the nad state and the ad - nad transition ; also , we experimentally observe ad , od and ad - od transitions that support our theoretical findings .",
    "at first , we consider two identical stuart - landau oscillators interacting directly through diffusive coupling and indirectly through a common environment @xmath0 , which is modeled as a damped dynamical system @xcite@xcite . mathematical model of the coupled system is given by    [ system ] @xmath1    here , @xmath2 @xmath3",
    ". the individual stuart - landau oscillators are of unit amplitude and having eigenfrequency @xmath4 .",
    "the diffusive coupling strength is given by @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the environmental coupling strength that controls the mutual interaction between the systems and environment .",
    "@xmath7 represents the damping factor of the environment ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "eq.([system ] ) has a trivial homogeneous steady state ( hss ) , which is the origin @xmath9 , and additionally two coupling dependent nontrivial fixed points @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the fixed points @xmath17 give the inhomogeneous steady states ( ihss ) ; note that it depends only upon @xmath5 and independent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; _ stabilization _ of ihss results in od .",

    "( nhss ) , stabilization of which gives rise to a novel nontrivial amplitude death ( nad ) state , which is a nonzero bistable state .",

    "is a fifth - order polynomial , it is difficult to predict bifurcation points from the eigenvalues ; thus , we derive the bifurcation points from the properties of coefficients of the characteristic equation itself using the method stated in ref.@xcite .",
    "a close inspection of the nontrivial fixed points reveals that the ihss , @xmath17 , appears through a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath25 also , the nhss , @xmath18 , appears through a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath26 further , from eq .",
    "we derive the following values of @xmath5 ( by setting @xmath27 @xcite ) and @xmath6 ( by setting @xmath28 @xcite ) where hopf bifurcations ( of trivial hss ) occur , respectively : @xmath29 with an additional condition : @xmath30 .",
    "we find that all the eigenvalues at the trivial hss have negative real part and thus gives rise to ad when @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . to corroborate our analysis we compute the two parameter bifurcation diagram in @xmath34 space using the @xmath35 package @xcite .",

    "we conclude that although the simultaneous application of direct and indirect coupling was proposed as a general scheme for inducing amplitude death state @xcite , in this paper we have shown that this coupling scheme can induce several other oscillation quenching states such as od and a new nontrivial ad ( nad ) state that is a bistable state ; this nad state has different manifestation and genesis compared to the conventional ad state .",
    "further , we have shown that this coupling scheme can induce transitions from ad to od ( with the variation in diffusive coupling strength ) , and ad to nad ( with the variation in environmental coupling strength ) .",
    "the latter transition is reported for the first time .",
    "we have also reported the first experimental evidence of oscillation suppression states and their transitions induced by this direct - indirect coupling .    in the present paper",
    "we have investigated two generic periodic oscillators that have certain type of symmetry . in biological systems ( where negative concentrations are forbidden ) and chaotic systems",
    "the bifurcation scenarios will be much more complex . since in biological oscillators",
    "non - negative asymmetric od states have already been reported ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , we hope that the theoretical findings of this paper will be valid for biological oscillators , also .",
    "but , the exact bifurcation scenario may be different and that requires further investigations .",
    "further , we test the system dynamics for a regular network of large number of oscillators ( not reported in the present manuscript ) and find that the said ad , od and nad states are preserved for the larger system , also .    since in biological systems both diffusive and environmental coupling are omnipresent @xcite ,",
    "thus we believe that this detailed study will improve our understanding of several biological processes .",
    "more specifically , as we have shown that in the nad state the system becomes bistable , thus , further research is required to explore any possible connection of nad to the bistability arises in many biological processes such as the bistability in the brain activity @xcite ( e.g. sleep - wake cycle of mammals and birds ) , _ lac _ operon in the bacteria _",
    "@xcite , cell cycle @xcite , etc .",
    "further , one of the central topics of recent research is to identify the coupling schemes that can implement bistability in biological systems and many schemes have already been identified and experimentally verified in this context @xcite .",
    "future research can be undertaken in order to explore the role of the direct - indirect coupling studied here in inducing bistability in biological systems .",
