    "the multiphoton ionization of the hydrogen atom in a strong microwave field is an example of a low  dimensional quantum system that manifests behavior typical of classical nonlinear systems , such as chaos and high sensitivity to field parameters .",
    "ever since the first experiments on the ionization of hydrogen atoms in a strong microwave field @xcite this system has been studied extensively for various regimes of the applied field : from high to low ",
    "frequency regimes , and from linear to circular polarization of the field @xcite .",
    "the ionization dynamics turns out to be strongly dependent on the parameters of the applied field , such as frequency , field amplitude , the shape of the field envelope , and the choice of initial ensemble of states subjected to the field @xcite .",
    "experiments @xcite on the ionization of hydrogen atom in strong elliptically polarized ( ep ) microwaves have demonstrated the dynamics in this case to be quite complex , exposing new effects that are absent from the circularly polarized ( cp ) and linearly polarized ( lp ) field limits .",
    "the ionization dynamics was observed to be extremely sensitive to the polarization degree of the electric field .",
    "moreover , three - dimensional classical simulations of the experiment , reproduce the experimental results very well @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the ionization yields , deduced experimentally and numerically , interpolate unevenly between lp and cp limits and for the ep fields follow a non  monotonic rise with the increase of the scaled field amplitude . by viewing the system in the frame rotating with the time ",
    "dependent angular velocity of the ep field the authors in @xcite used a quantum  mechanical approach to show that the problem can be reduced to a rydberg atom subjected to two effective static fields , magnetic and electric .",
    "the sensitivity of the ionization to the ellipticity degree observed experimentally was ascribed to dependence of the effective magnetic interaction on the ellipticity degree . while the use of the quantum  mechanical approach for hydrogen in an ep field reproduces the experimental trends , a connection with the classical approach , which has been traditional in this subject , is desirable . the question still remains open : why are the current experimental data on ionization yield curves of hydrogen atom in ep microwave fields in good agreement with the corresponding classical simulations @xcite ?",
    "most classical treatments in the literature use some simplifications of dynamics based on the existing symmetries or reduction of the full three - dimensional dynamics of the system to a lower  dimensional one @xcite . to give an example , the adiabatic approximation used by griffith and farrelly @xcite to study three - dimensional hydrogen atom in ep field",
    "reduces the dimensionality of the effective phase space and limits the dynamics to that of the circular rydberg states .",
    "the averaging that is performed in @xcite is valid only in the low  frequency regime ( the driving frequency of the field is much smaller than the unperturbed kepler frequency of the problem ) .",
    "the presence of a time ",
    "dependent term in the rotating - frame hamiltonian is another challenge that the ep field brings .",
    "in addition , the absence of conserved quantities , such as energy and angular momentum integrals , prevents one from reducing the dimensionality of the dynamics . for the lp and cp problems such a reduction is possible due to existence of additional constants of motion .",
    "in contrast , for the ep field problem the energy and angular momentum are not conserved . in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility to view a full  dimensional system dynamics by means of fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) fields of stability @xcite .",
    "the fli method is independent of the dimensionality of the system .",
    "it provides pictures of global stability structures for any given subspace of the phase space of the system @xcite . besides , the method is robust because it is applicable even in regimes which can not be studied by any other existing analytical methods .",
    "the complex features of ionization dynamics of hydrogen atom in ep microwave field reported in recent experiments @xcite are due to the higher dimensionality of the ep problem as opposed to the cp and lp problems .",
    "classically , for systems of three or higher degrees of freedom the phase space dynamics is known to possess much richer features than the one for the lower dimensional systems .",
    "the principal feature that distinguishes the phase space dynamics of hamiltonian system of dimension three and higher is the possibility of a well  known phenomenon of arnold diffusion ( diffusion along the resonances ) @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is essential for examining all the possible scenarios that lead to the classical ionization for hydrogen subjected to the electromagnetic field .",
    "the relevance of the phase space dynamics to the classical ionization of hydrogen in non  stationary fields has been noted by many authors @xcite . in short , invariant tori can prevent chaotic diffusion of trajectories and , therefore , can hinder them from ionizing .",
    "the onset of stochastic ionization for the hamiltonian systems has been traditionally investigated by means of the resonance overlap criterion proposed by chirikov @xcite .",
    "it was applied to the classical ionization dynamics for the hydrogen atom driven by lp and cp field in @xcite .",
    "the set of action ",
    "angle variables required for this analysis is only well  defined in the limit of vanishing field . for the classical system of hydrogen atom subjected to a strong ep field the application of action - angle variables in an overlap criterion",
    "is not practical .",
    "instead , we propose to study the onset of stochasticity in the phase space of the system by means of fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) stability analysis @xcite . by evaluating the indicator of chaoticity for each integrated trajectory from an ensemble of trajectories",
    "we obtain the underlying resonant structures for any given subspace .",
    "the experimental data @xcite do not provide much information about the character of the states that determine the observed ionization threshold .",
    "in fact , most of the initial states used in the experiment are switched by the turn  on of the field to different locations in the phase space @xcite .",
    "some of the states that remain bounded after the rise of the field pulse are closer to stochastic ionization than the other states .",
    "the character of the states more favorable to ionization has been a matter of debate in the theory community .",
    "investigations on the ionization by the cp field in high  frequency regime were carried out by howard @xcite and by sacha and zakrzewski @xcite .",
    "using essentially the same technique , the chirikov overlap criterion , these two groups arrived at different conclusions regarding to the type of the orbits that ionize first under the application of the field .",
    "howard claimed that most orbits become elongated before they ionize , hence that the high eccentricity orbits are more prone to ionization .",
    "however , results in @xcite contradict this point of view and the authors show that ionization occurs first for the medium eccentricity orbits . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that the ionization mechanism strongly depends on the region of phase space that the original ensemble will be switched to by the application of the field . generally speaking ,",
    "orbits with different eccentricities can be switched to different regions of the phase space and to different energies in the rotating frame of the cp field problem . in this paper",
    "we describe in details the character of the states that undergo ionization and determine the behavior of ionization yields for the low amplitudes of the field .",
    "the principal difficulty is the direct comparison of our results with experiments @xcite .",
    "it is essential to point out , that our qualitative analysis is performed for ensembles of states with the same initial energy and different values of classical action and angular momentum , as opposed to the ensemble of states used in the experiment .",
    "our purpose in this choice is to relate the underlying phase space structures to the ionization dynamics of the system .",
    "the recent experimental success in creating field - maintained non - spreading electronic wave packets @xcite has renewed the discussion on synthesizing coherent states launched from the lagrange equilibria of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the size of the stability region surrounding the lagrange equilibrium points is important in maintaining stable non  spreading three - dimensional coherent quantum states at those points .",
    "the addition of a magnetic field to the cp problem was shown to play an important role in the stabilization of the equilibria and enlarge the critical region of stability in the parameter space defined by the jacobi constant , and the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we extend these findings to the ep problem by using fast lyapunov indicator stability technique .",
    "we show that the stability of the lagrange equilibria can be controlled by manipulating the field polarization in addition to the jacobi constant , and the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "much of our understanding of complex details of the classical ionization mechanism depends on a thorough knowledge of the multidimensional dynamics of the system .",
    "therefore , we will apply the fli method so as to obtain some insight into the stability of the phase - space structures of the system .",
    "the paper is organized in five sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the hamiltonian and describe the concept of time  dependent zero  velocity surface ( zvs ) in the frame rotating with the frequency of the applied field .",

    "first , the structures of the fli stability plots are described for the well  studied cases of lp and cp electric fields and zero magnetic field .",
    "the energy of the initial states is equal to the maximum of the zvs . in the case of the cp problem",
    "the fli plot matches perfectly the poincar surface structure .",
    "secondly , we perform the fli analysis for more complicated problems of hydrogen in ep fields ( the magnetic field is again equal to zero ) .",
    "the ionization dynamics for the ep problem is analogous to the lp and cp problems : two distinct sets of bounded orbits located around the center and near the maximum of the zvs are identified . with the increase of the amplitude of the electric field",
    "the orbits from the latter set become chaotic and ionize .",
    "the size of the stability zone around the zvs maximum is used to estimate qualitatively the behavior of the ionization probabilities versus scaled amplitude of the field .",
    "then , the fli stability analysis is applied to the ensemble of initial states with the energy much below the saddle of the zvs .",
