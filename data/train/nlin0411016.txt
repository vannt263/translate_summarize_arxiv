    "following the first paper of this series @xcite , we address discrete systems and differential - difference equations , which have become topics of increasing physical and mathematical importance . the variety of physical applications where such models are relevant , and their significant differences from the mathematical theory of partial differential equations , contribute to recent interest in these topics .",
    "the applicability of such models extends to areas as diverse as nonlinear optics , atomic and soft condensed - matter physics , as well as biophysics : specific details and references can be found in our first paper @xcite as well as in reviews @xcite .",
    "the second paper is devoted to existence and stability of coherent structures in two - dimensional lattices , which include both discrete solitons @xcite and discrete vortices @xcite .",
    "these two - dimensional coherent structures have emerged recently in studies of photorefractive crystals in nonlinear optics @xcite and droplets of optical lattices in bose - einstein condensates @xcite . a significant boost to this subject",
    "was given by the experimental realization of two - dimensional photonic crystal lattices with periodic potentials based on the ideas of @xcite .",
    "as a result , discrete solitons were observed in @xcite , while more complex structures such as dipoles , soliton trains and vector solitons were observed in @xcite .",
    "most recently , observations of discrete vortices were reported by two independent groups @xcite where the fundamental vortices with topological charge _",
    "one _ were experimentally created and detected in photorefractive crystals .",
    "two main examples of charge - one discrete vortices include a _ vortex cross _ ( an on - site centered vortex ) and a _ vortex cell _ ( an off - site centered vortex ) .",
    "these structures were also recently predicted in a continuous two - dimensional model with the periodic potential @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have stimulated further theoretical work and numerical computations .",
    "thus , while in @xcite , discrete vortices of charge _ two _ were shown to be unstable , recently in @xcite discrete vortices of charge _",
    "three _ were found to be stable .",
    "based on the theoretical predictions of @xcite , further experiments on localized structures were undertaken to unveil other interesting structures , such as the discrete soliton necklace which is more globally stable compared to the charge three vortex @xcite .",
    "the discrete vortices have been also extended to three - dimensional discrete models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , asymmetric vortices have been recently predicted in the two - dimensional lattices in @xcite .",
    "the above activity clearly signals the importance and experimental relevance of discrete solitons and vortices in two - dimensional discrete lattices",
    ". however , most of the above mentioned works are predominantly of experimental or numerical nature , while the mathematical theory of existence and stability of discrete localized structures has not been developed to a similar extent .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop a categorization of discrete solitons and vortices in the discrete two - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations .",
    "we start from a well - understood limit ( the so - called anti - continuum case of zero coupling between the lattice nodes ) and examining persistence of the limiting solutions for small coupling by means of the lyapunov - schmidt theory .",
    "this method allows us to discuss persistence and stability of the localized structures by analyzing finite - dimensional linear eigenvalue problems .",
    "the theoretical predictions agree well with full numerical computations of the discrete two - dimensional nls equation .",
    "our main results are summarized for the simplest localized structures in table 1 .",
    "these results corroborate and extend the previously reported experimental and numerical findings .",
    "we quantify the stability of the charge - one vortex in accordance to @xcite , the instability of the charge - two vortex in accordance to @xcite and the stability of the charge - three vortex in accordance to @xcite .",
    "we further demonstrate the instability of all asymmetric vortices proposed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our results can be used to extract the spectral stability of the dipole mode considered in @xcite and of the soliton necklace of @xcite .

    "persistence of localized modes for a particular square discrete contour is considered in section 3 .",
    "stability of the persistent solutions is addressed in section 4 .",
