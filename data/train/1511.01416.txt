    "entanglement is one of the most exciting topics in quantum mechanics , due it s unusual property of non - locality , which has been considering as a key source in quantum information processing . during the past decade , due the rapid development of the experimental process in quantum control ,",

    "there are potential applications in nearly all quantum communication and computation protocols @xcite , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum secure direct communication @xcite , quantum computation @xcite among others .",
    "one of the simplest schemes in which entanglement can be generated is a system containing a couple of two - level atoms . in 90 decade",
    ", two - atom entangled states have already been demonstrated experimentally using ultra cold trap ions @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) schemes @xcite .",
    "it has been showed that entangled states can be generated in a two - atom system by a continuous driving of the atoms with a coherent or chaotic thermal field @xcite , or by a pulse excitation followed by a continuous radiative decay @xcite . in order to confront the experimental results ,",
    "several theoretical studies have been considered for the preparation of a two - atom system in an entangled state . in references @xcite the entanglement of two atoms by spontaneous emission for a model that includes dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms",
    "have been discussed .",
    "the authors studied both numerically and analytically the concurrence and negativity for such a system . also , in reference @xcite the authors discussed numerical solutions for the concurrence in a system of two atoms driven by a laser field .",
    "in this work , we study the entanglement of a two - atom system driven by the quantum vacuum field , the whole system enclosed inside a spherical cavity of radius @xmath0 . as simplified model of the atoms we consider each one as single harmonic oscillator and the radiation field is taken as a massless scalar field .",
    "in order to give physical sense to our model we will work in the dressed coordinates and dressed states approach , that were introduced some time ago in references @xcite , in analogy with the renormalized fields in quantum field theory .",
    "such dressed coordinates and states have been defined in the physical context of an atom , approximated by an harmonic oscillator , linearly coupled to a scalar field and confined in a spherical cavity of radius @xmath0 . in terms of dressed coordinates , dressed states have been defined as the physically measurable states .",

    "also , the formalism showed to have the technical advantage of allowing exact computation of the probabilities associated with the different oscillator ( atom ) radiation processes @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been obtained easily the probability of the atom to decay spontaneously from the first excited state to the ground state for arbitrary coupling constant , weak or strong and for arbitrary cavity size . for weak coupling constant in the limit @xmath2",
    ", that corresponds to free space , the old know result : @xmath3 , has been obtained @xcite . also , considering a cavity of sufficiently small radius @xcite , the method accounted for the experimentally observed inhibition of the spontaneous decaying processes of the atom @xcite . in references @xcite the concept of dressed coordinates and states",
    "have been extended to the case in which nonlinear interactions between the oscillator and the field modes are taken into account .",

    "ii we describe the model of the two atoms coupled to a massless scalar field , find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the system and define the dressed coordinates and states . in section iii",
    "we compute some probability amplitudes , that will be useful for further study of the entanglement of the two - atom system inside the spherical cavity . in section",
    "iv we discuss the entanglement of the two - atom system through the quantitity called of concurrence , illustrating the behaviour of this quantity as a funtion of time , coupling constant and cavity radius . finally , in section v we give our conclusions",
