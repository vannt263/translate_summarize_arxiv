    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite can nowadays be almost perfectly controlled on the quantum level of motion and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "using special magic wavelength configurations for alkaline earth atoms , the lattice introduces only minimal perturbations of the transition frequency  @xcite .",
    "such systems are perfectly suited candidates for state - of - the - art precision measurements .",
    "optical lattice atomic clocks as cutting edge time standards are the most famous example of such exceedingly high resolution experiments  @xcite .",
    "recent endeavors have found what is yet the most accurate determination of time with a fractional uncertainty of @xmath3   @xcite .",
    "to achieve such a small total measurement error known noise sources ( e.g. atomic collisions ) had to be eliminated or corrected for by proper calibration .",
    "one remaining class of imprecisions is tied to the fairly high density of the atomic ensemble , which leads to radiative long range atom - atom interactions like collective decay ( super - radiance  @xcite ) and dipole - dipole shifts  @xcite . as they can not be totally avoided , recent calculations targeted the suppression of atomic interactions  @xcite via optimized lattice geometries and symmetries .",
    "a different but important uncertainty contribution for the clock is the finite linewidth of the reference laser used to interrogate the atomic ensemble . despite tremendous efforts to construct ultra - stable reference cavities resulting in sub - hertz oscillators ,",
    "the randomly fluctuating phase of the laser still contributes significantly to the uncertainty budget in experiments  @xcite .",
    "this phase noise acts identically on all atoms and hence adds to the collective atomic dipole .",
    "therefore the effect can not be canceled by increasing the size of the ensemble .",
    "mathematically , the effect of a noisy laser addressing the atomic ensemble leads to an exponential dephasing of the collective atomic dipole reducing the amount of information about the phase state of the atoms . over the course of multiple measurements the phase noise aliases ( dick effect  @xcite ) and degrades the stability of the clock .",
    "first studies of the effects of laser noise on spectroscopy have been put forward already decades ago almost in parallel with the successful development of high resolution laser spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the laser phase and intensity lead to atomic population fluctuations limiting the spectroscopic resolution  @xcite . with the fast improvements in laser technology",
    "the linewidth of lasers soon became so small , that this effect could be largely ignored in typical setups . only in the ultimate limit of clock transitions",
    "the linewidth is significantly smaller than available lasers . in this case",
    "the remaining fast fluctuations can be traced to thermal fluctuations in the mirror coatings while slow changes in the cavity length lead to a drift of the average oscillation frequency  @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have analytically and numerically treated the effect of both phase and amplitude noise .",
    "these studies have been mostly focused on deriving spectroscopic precision limits for the case of multipartite entangled input states  @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches aimed to compute bounds for noisy metrology beyond the standard quantum limit .",
    "while it has generally been assumed that laser noise is especially detrimental to the typically fragile multipartite entangled states , significant limitations may occur already for classical product input states .",
    "in this paper we restrict our calculations to such product states in order to address current limitations of standard setups used in high - precision frequency detection .",
    "we derive scaling laws for the frequency sensitivity of both ramsey and rabi spectroscopy in the presence of collective laser noise .",
    "we map the stochastic laser - induced dynamics into an atomic master equation and show that amplitude noise has little impact on the precision .",
    "however , collective laser phase noise can lead to a complete saturation of the frequency sensitivity with the atom number ( as shown for entangled states in ref .",
    "we apply the proposal from ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses decoherence free subspaces for the efficient suppression of phase noise .",
    "this is also reminiscent of the mechanism of quantum noise cancelation in atomic or optomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "our scheme is analogous to the negative mass oscillator employed in the aforementioned optomechenical investigations .",
    "the suppression can be achieved by splitting the atomic ensemble into two sub - ensembles : the incident laser beam is also split and manipulated such that one sub - ensemble experiences the exact negative detuning ( between the laser and the atomic transition frequency ) of the other .",
    "we consider an ensemble of identical two - level atoms with a transition frequency @xmath4 . in a frame rotating with the laser frequency",
    "@xmath5 the ensemble is following free dynamics under the hamiltonian ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the @xmath10 pauli operator of the @xmath11-th atom and @xmath12 is the detuning between the atomic transition and the laser frequency .",
    "the hamiltonian describing optical excitation of this ensemble reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coherent pump strength and @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that all atoms instantaneously feel any change of the laser phase , which is justified given that typical setups are of much smaller length than the coherence length of a standard laser  @xcite . furthermore , assuming white noise ( i.e. no correlations in time ) we may describe the phase noise of a laser as collective dephasing of the atoms via the lindblad term @xmath16 & = \\frac{\\gamma_d}{2}\\left(2s_z\\rho s_z - s_z^2\\rho - \\rho s_z^2\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 is the strength of the dephasing at which the off - diagonal density matrix elements are damped out .",
    "the time dynamics for the atomic density matrix @xmath18 including laser phase noise are then described by the master equation @xmath19 + \\mathcal{l}_d[\\rho],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 . for details of the derivation of this master equation",
    "@xcite or appendix a.    analogously , if the laser has a noisy amplitude given by another white noise process and any change of amplitude instantly affects all atoms , we may describe the dynamics of the atomic ensemble by replacing the lindblad term in the above master equation with ( see also appendix a ) @xmath21 & = 2\\gamma_a\\left(2s_x\\rho s_x - s_x^2\\rho - \\rho s_x^2\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 governs the magnitude of the noise .",
    "hence , amplitude noise can be interpreted as collective energy redistribution within the atomic ensemble .",
    "note , that one key point of this model is that all noise processes are of collective nature .",
    "this allows for simplified analytical and numerical treatment since the evolution described by the master equation takes place on the surface of the collective bloch sphere , in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath23 .",
    "ramsey spectroscopy  @xcite consists of two consecutive @xmath24-pulses applied to an atomic ensemble initially in the ground state . in between the two pulses the atoms",
    "are subjected to a period of free time evolution for a time @xmath1 .",
    "after the second pulse the total population inversion of the atomic ensemble , which is proportional to the expectation value @xmath25 , is measured .",
    "this process is repeated for different laser frequencies ( detunings ) to retrieve the excitation as a function of the delay time and the detuning , @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath24-pulses are assumed to be much faster than characteristic dephasing times and are therefore well approximated by rotations of the collective bloch vector of the atoms about the y - axis of the bloch sphere by an angle of @xmath24 ( at exact resonance ) .",
    "a figure of merit for the total frequency measurement precision is the so - called signal sensitivity @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this quantity characterizes the minimal distinguishable frequency shift in the setup and thus gives the fundamental limit of accuracy with which one can match the laser frequency to the atomic transition frequency .",
    "the optimal operation points are those where the signal is most sensitive to changes in the detuning @xmath29 while the signal quantum standard deviation @xmath30 is minimized .",
    "let us first estimate the effect of the collective phase noise on the signal sensitivity obtained by interrogating an ensemble of @xmath31 atoms with a laser exhibiting phase noise . as previously mentioned , due to the collective nature of the hamiltonian and the liouvillian , all system dynamics take place in the symmetric subspace , i.e. the dicke basis .",
    "the density matrix in this basis is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . substituting eq . into the master equation , i.e. eq . , we find differential equations for all density matrix elements of the form @xmath35\\rho_{m , m'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the derivative of each density matrix element is proportional to the matrix element itself , an integration of the equation above is straightforward",
    ".     atoms as a function of the interrogation time .",
    "the optimal time is @xmath36 .",
    "( b ) the optimal signal sensitivity in the presence of phase noise saturates quickly with increasing @xmath31 approaching the lower bound ( blue dots ) .",
    "this is compared to the projection noise limited curve scaling with @xmath2 ( for a fixed interrogation time @xmath37 ) on a double - logarithmic scale . ]",
    "the initial state for the free time evolution ( the state after the first @xmath24-pulse ) is described by the density matrix with the elements @xmath38^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the resulting solutions , we find that the expectation value @xmath25 after the second @xmath24-pulse is @xmath39 a somewhat more involved but nevertheless straightforward computation delivers the expression of the variance , which is proportional to the expectation value of the squared signal operator ( for details see appendix b ) , @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now the minimization with respect to @xmath29 in eq .",
    "can be carried out .",
    "the minimum is found where the derivative of the signal @xmath41 is extremal , i.e. @xmath42 . the final expression of the signal sensitivity for a standard ramsey experiment is @xmath43    an illustration of the temporal behavior of the sensitivity for @xmath44 atoms is given in  figure [ fig1](a ) . in the absence of phase noise ( @xmath45 ) we recover the quantum projection noise limit .",
    "the most prominent characteristic is that already for a small number of atoms the sensitivity saturates , i.e. it omits its scaling with the atom number .",
    "the value which it saturates to is found by taking the limit @xmath46 : @xmath47 the optimization over @xmath1 leads to a transcendental equation @xmath48 which can be numerically solved to indicate that the optimal sensitivity is simply limited by the bandwidth of the noise , @xmath49\\approx 0.951\\gamma_d.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this behavior is depicted in figure [ fig1](b ) , where the signal sensitivity optimized with respect to the interrogation time asymptotically approaches this lower bound . a similar bound that shows a saturation with the atom number @xmath31",
    "was derived for ghz - states in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now analyze the dynamics described by eq .   which includes the effects of amplitude noise .",
    "using standard numerical methods , we can immediately uncover a particular limitation introduced by amplitude noise .",
    "the scaling of the sensitivity is modified from the typical @xmath50 to @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated in  figure [ fig2](a ) where the sensitivities obtained in both the degradation - free regime ( @xmath51 ) and for @xmath52 are compared .",
    "the crossover between the two scaling regimes is reached at around the inverse of the amplitude noise bandwidth @xmath53 .",
    "atoms . as can be seen in the double - logarithmic plot , the sensitivity scales like the quantum projection noise @xmath50 at short times and it transitions to a scaling with @xmath0 for larger time scales .",
    "( b ) the amplitude noise limit exhibits a scaling law of @xmath2 with the atom number . ]",
    "we now fix a duration of the free time evolution @xmath54 deep inside the @xmath0 scaling regime and investigate the scaling of the sensitivity with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "numerical simulations [ see  figure [ fig2](b ) ] carried up to a fairly large number of atoms @xmath55 suggest that amplitude noise does not modify the scaling of the sensitivity with @xmath31 , @xmath56    under typical experimental conditions amplitude noise is orders of magnitude smaller than the phase noise , i.e. @xmath57 . therefore , as suggested by the analysis above , the first signature of laser noise is the saturation of the sensitivity with an increasing atom number occurring at times much smaller than the times where amplitude noise becomes important .",
    "+ let us note that this result agrees with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite where uncorrelated perpendicular noise ( equivalent to independent amplitude noise ) is shown to be far less detrimental than parallel noise ( phase noise ) for the spectroscopic resolution with entangled initial states .",
    "to overcome the saturation effect introduced by the noise associated with laser phase and frequency fluctuations , we employ a twin interrogation technique as in ref .",
    "this assumes the division of the @xmath31-atom ensemble into two separately addressable sub - ensembles of @xmath58 atoms each ( with @xmath31 even and @xmath59 the corresponding population difference operators ) .",
    "moreover , we set the detunings of the two ensembles opposite to each other leading to the hamiltonian @xmath60 as a replacement of the free evolution hamiltonian in the standard ramsey method .",
    "this constitutes an effective time - reversal operation as the sub - ensembles associated dipoles rotate opposite to each other in time under the action of the same hamiltonian .",
    "this can not be simply realized by shifting the frequency of each ensemble upwards and downwards compared to the laser frequency but rather involves changing the sign of the laser frequency .",
    "the key point of this mechanism is that , while the systems evolve freely with @xmath61 , the noise retains its collective nature @xmath62 according to eq .  .",
    "in a first step we notice that the difference in detunings in eq .   breaks the symmetry such that the complete hilbert space can no longer be described by a dicke basis . each sub - ensemble in itself",
    "though is restricted to its symmetric subspace , such that we can describe each ensemble with a dicke basis .",
    "the complete basis is then just the product basis of the subspaces .",
    "we may write the total atomic density matrix as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and each sum runs from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "the differential equations for the density matrix elements we obtain from the master equation now read @xmath67\\rho_{m_1,m_2}^{m_1',m_2'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] their integration is straightforward and the density matrix at time @xmath1 can be derived ( for details see appendix b ) for the initial conditions @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a first result we find that the signal @xmath25 is identical to the one in eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , the standard deviation of the signal is drastically changed : at the point where the signal vanishes ( optimal detection point ) the variance is @xmath69 the significant reduction in the detection quantum noise is immediately apparent by comparing the result s scaling with @xmath31 to the one in eq .  .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig5](b ) clearly shows how the noise cancelation mechanism leads to an extremely reduced quantum noise exactly at the points of maximum signal slope where previously the noise was maximized .",
    "the frequency detection sensitivity is subsequently enhanced @xmath70 the optimal interrogation time is as before around @xmath36 .",
    "however , the result is remarkable in that the optimal sensitivity recovers the @xmath2 scaling as in the case of the noise - free ramsey procedure .",
    "after numerical minimization with respect to @xmath1 , the optimal sensitivity is @xmath71 & \\approx \\frac{0.969}{\\sqrt{n}}\\gamma_d.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     and interrogation time @xmath72 . the deviation is significantly reduced at the steepest parts of the signal when using opposite detunings which allows for a more precise measurement of frequency . ]",
    "note , that the result obtained above can be exactly reproduced by inverting the sign of the phase instead of the detuning in one of the arms of the twin beam interrogation scheme ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this leaves the free hamiltonian unchanged but yields a modified dissipator describing collective dephasing with the operator @xmath73 , which is the approach used in ref .",
    "another method routinely used in quantum metrology is rabi spectroscopy where the population excited during an attempted @xmath74-pulse is monitored against the atom - laser detuning . to model this procedure we introduce a coherent driving laser described by the hamiltonian from eq . .",
    "the reversible dynamics of the system are then subject to both the free hamiltonian @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the condition for a perfect population inversion pulse on resonance is that the pulse area equals @xmath74 which requires a pulse duration of @xmath77 .",
    "the frequency sensitivity is then extracted from the detected population signal at the points of the steepest signal to the left and to the right of the resonance .",
    "and we chose a sufficiently small driving of @xmath78 in order to minimize power broadening effects . ]",
    "we proceed with numerical investigations focused on describing and overcoming the effect of phase noise during the rabi procedure .",
    "the system hamiltonian for standard rabi spectroscopy reads @xmath79 while for the suppression of noise we will employ the asymmetric free hamiltonian @xmath80 defined in eq . .",
    "similarly to the case of ramsey spectroscopy , we have illustrated an example of the signal and its standard deviation in  figure [ fig6 ] ; the effect of noise reduction occurs again at the optimal operation point where the change of the signal with the detuning is maximal .",
    "we quantify the enhancement by using the definition of the signal sensitivity from eq .   as a figure of merit for the frequency detection sensitivity .",
    "the red dots in  figure [ fig7 ] convey the message that phase noise again leads to a saturation effect when the atom number is increased .",
    "the blue dots instead approximately show the recovery of the @xmath2 scaling .    _ .",
    "while for standard addressing the sensitivity begins to saturate already for @xmath81 , when employing opposite detunings the signal sensitivity approximately scales with @xmath2 .",
    "an exact fit returns a scaling with @xmath82 .",
    "the driving strength is fixed to @xmath83 . ]",
    "we have investigated the effects of both laser phase and amplitude noise on the sensitive detection of frequencies via the ramsey and rabi technique . for ramsey spectroscopy",
    "we have found analytical expressions showing a saturation of the minimum sensitivity with the increasing atom number under the action of phase noise . to counteract this effect ,",
    "we have used an approach which involves the separate interrogation of two sub - ensembles leading to the recovery of the typical standard quantum limited scaling with @xmath2 .",
    "this setup is closely related to the one illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is also reminiscent of techniques used in recent proposals for counteracting the effect of noise  @xcite in quantum force detection setups : we describe an anti - noise path obtained via the inclusion of a negatively detuned sub - ensemble playing the role of a negative mass oscillator . for amplitude noise , we have also numerically uncovered a particular scaling of the ramsey sensitivity with @xmath0 at times larger than the inverse of the amplitude noise characteristic rate @xmath84 .",
    "numerical investigations suggest that similar results hold for rabi spectroscopy .",
