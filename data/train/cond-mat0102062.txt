    "the thermostatistical properties of systems of @xmath0 classical particles under a long  range attractive potential have been extensively studied since the seminal work of antonov  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of their more specific and interesting properties is that they are unstable for all @xmath0  @xcite and therefore not thermodynamically extensive , i.e. they exhibit negative specific heat regions even when the system is composed by a very large number of particles .",
    "it is quite natural to ask whether the total angular momentum @xmath2 , which is an integral of motion for systems of relevance in the astrophysical context , plays a non  trivial role on the equilibrium properties of these systems .",
    "indeed @xmath2 is considered as an important parameter in order to understand the physics of systems like galaxies @xcite ; globular clusters @xcite ; molecular clouds in multifragmentation regime @xcite which might eventually lead to stellar formation @xcite .",
    "previous works have already studied the effect of @xmath2 in the mean field limit with a simplified potential and imposing a spherical symmetry  @xcite ; or at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "our work , presented in this paper , is an attempt to overcome some of these approximations .",
    "thermodynamical equilibrium does not exist for newtonian self  gravitating systems , due both to evaporation of stars ( the systems are not self  bounded ) and short distance singularity in the interaction potential .",
    "however there exists intermediate stages where these two effects might be neglected and a quasi  equilibrium state might be reached ( dynamical issues like ergodicity , mixing or `` approach to equilibrium ''  @xcite are not considered in this paper ) . in order to make the existence of equilibrium configurations possible we have , first , to bound the system in an artificial box and , second , to add a short distance cutoff to the potential .",
    "the latter point can be seen as an attempt to take into account the appearance of new physics at very short distances ( about the influence of this short cut see  @xcite ) .",
    "another way to avoid the difficulties due to the short distance singularity is to describe the function of distribution of the `` stars '' within a fermi  dirac statistic @xcite .",
    "the box breaks the translational symmetry of the system , therefore the total linear momentum @xmath7 and angular momentum @xmath2 are not conserved .",
    "nevertheless we assume that the equilibration time is smaller than the characteristic time after which the box plays a significant role  @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath7 and @xmath2 are considered as ( quasi)conserved quantities .",
    "we put the center of the box at the center of mass @xmath8 which is also set to be the center of the coordinates .",
    "therefore @xmath9 .",
    "as already mentioned , self  gravitating systems are non  extensive and a statistical description based on their intensive parameters should be taken with caution since the different statistical ensembles are only equivalent at the thermodynamical limit far from first order transitions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : beta - beta - gamma ] ) .",
    "moreover , this limit is required in order to define phases and phase transitions if one fixes the intensive parameters  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the microcanonical ensemble ( me ) does not require this limit , it allows a classification of phase transitions for finite size systems  @xcite .",
    "hence the considered system is studied within the natural me framework .    in order to perform the computation in a reasonable time we have to consider a two dimensional system .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section  [ sec : micr - prop ] we recall the analytical expressions for entropy and its derivatives ( sec .  [",

    "we recover the homogeneous gas phase .",

    "the overall structure of the collapse phases matches the one of the angular velocity @xmath40 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wsurf ] ) : roughly , the peaks in @xmath40 correspond to pure phases while the valleys between these peaks belong to the first order phase transition region . due to a lack of precision we are yet unable to ensure that the two isolated pure phases at @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 are really isolated and not linked to a pure phase at lower energies .",

    "they introduced the canonical analogous of the @xmath222 ensemble namely the @xmath233 ensemble ( gbe ) , see eq .",

    "there are mainly two reasons invoked to study a system in ce instead of in me    1 .",
    "performing the computations in ce are in most cases much easier than in me . here",
    "ce can be seen as a trick @xcite .",
    "however there is a priori no reason for the results to be equivalent . indeed the strict equivalence of the ensemble is only achieved at the thermodynamical limit except in the first order phase transition regions  @xcite . in a weaker sense , needed for small systems , me and ce can only be equivalent when @xmath234 and far from any first order phase transition regions ( see below ) .",
    "moreover recent progress in computer performance enables one to perform now numerical experiments within the me for increasingly complex systems .",
    "the studied system is not isolated but is in contact with a `` heat bath '' and exchange amounts of @xmath48 with it .",
    "then , obviously me does not provide a suitable description , and ce might be eligible . here",
    "ce describes a _ different _ physical system than the one in me . at the thermodynamical limit ( if it exists ) the ensembles are again equivalent except at first order phase transitions",
    "however , the ce description is valid only if the hamiltonian of interaction @xmath235 is small comparing to the ones of the system @xmath236 and the heat bath @xmath237 .",
    "this condition is usually fulfilled at the thermodynamical limit ( if it exists ) , but for small ones @xmath238 can hardly be small at least comparing to @xmath239 and this can lead to dramatic effects  @xcite . in this case a better description would be the me of the system , its `` heat bath '' _ and _ their interactions .    for now on we consider in this paper the cases when ce is used as a mathematical trick , and we focus and the amount of information lost from me to ce .",
    "the link between me and ce is given by laplace transform ( using the notations introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase - phase - trans ] ) @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the partition sum of the ce ; @xmath242 are the intensive variables associated with @xmath48 and defined by @xmath243 for @xmath244 .",
    "the me at @xmath57 is equivalent to the ce at @xmath245 if the integrand in eq .",

    "this condition is violated when @xmath65 ( this is the basic idea behind the definition of phase transitions in small systems , see  @xcite ) .",
    "so in practice all informations contained in points where @xmath219 are lost after the laplace transform  ( [ eq:37 ] ) in ce .",
    "now we are left with the points @xmath57 characterized by @xmath64 ; this relation implies only that @xmath248 has a local maximum at @xmath57 but not that it is a _",
    "one ; @xmath218 is a necessary but not sufficient condition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sex ] we have illustrated this point with a trivial one  dimensional example ; all the points below the maxwell line do not correspond to global maxima and their information content is smeared out and , in practice , lost in ce .    from the last remark",
    "we see that a way to check if a point corresponds to a global maximum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:37 ] ) is to study what would be a generalization of the maxwell line in @xmath66 dimensions .",
    "work is in progress in this direction and the results will be presented elsewhere , but we can already state that this task is , to some extent , similar to the one of building the _ convex hull _ of a set of points in @xmath46 dimensions , or more specifically the convex hull of the entropy @xmath3 .    however ,",
    "if one needs qualitative results , in two dimensions the task can be rather easily solved in another way .",
    "let us define @xmath249 the tangent plane to @xmath45 at @xmath57 ; its equation is @xmath250 . if @xmath248 has a global maximum at @xmath57 then @xmath251 for all @xmath252 and @xmath253 by definition .    in the case of the gravitational model presented here @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "now if one inspects the entropy surface @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ssurf ] ) it is clear that condition ( [ eq:38 ] ) is not satisfied for all the points in the region filled with dashed lines ( @xmath16 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdet ] .",
    "this is due to the concavity of the energy ground state @xmath145 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : entropy - other - things ] ) .",
    "@xmath16 includes all the two  clusters collapsed phases , the first and second order phase transitions ( except for @xmath256 ) .",
    "all the information contained in @xmath16 is smeared out through the laplace transform ( [ eq:37 ] ) in gbe and , in practice , lost .    the fact that gbe misses all the two  clusters collapse phases would be already enough to disqualify it as being a good approximation ( mathematical trick ) of the me .",
    "but , furthermore , if one studies more carefully @xmath248 , @xmath257 ; one will notice that ( a ) there is one local maximum at @xmath167 and ( b ) there is no maximum for high @xmath119 : in the direction of increasing @xmath119 at low energy , @xmath248 is a never ending increasing function , i.e. @xmath248 has _ no global maximum _ for @xmath258 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : n20.f ] ) .",
    "therefore the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:37 ] ) _ diverges _ for all @xmath259 , @xmath260 . in other words",
    "the gbe , in our model , is _ not defined _ for high @xmath99 and @xmath261 ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "this example shows how dramatic can be the information loss if one studies an isolated system in the ce .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the results of a study of a self  gravitating system of @xmath0 classical particles on a disk of radius @xmath10 for which two extensive variables , namely total energy @xmath1 and total angular momentum @xmath2 are fixed .",
    "the microcanonical entropy @xmath3 can be written as the logarithm of an integral over the spatial configurations ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the conservation of @xmath2 implies that the mean value of the linear momentum @xmath263 of a particle at a radial distance @xmath166 is proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath166 ( [ eq:11 ] ) ; in the mean the system rotates like a solid body , i.e. the mean angular velocity of a particle does not depend on its position ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath263 is broader than the one it had if @xmath2 would not be conserved and depends on the radial position ( [ eq:16 ] ) . in order to integrate @xmath264",
    "we write it as the folding product of a `` background '' function @xmath124 and the weight associated with the remaining energy ( [ eq:19 ] ) .",
    "once a numerical estimate of @xmath124 is obtained , @xmath3 and its derivatives , such as the inverse temperature @xmath99 , can be computed .",
    "the entropy surface shows an intruder in the energy direction which signals a first order phase transition with negative specific heat ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssurf ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : betasurf ] ) .",
    "contrary to another model  @xcite there is no critical value of @xmath2 above which this transition is no longer present , nevertheless there are several points of the parametric space @xmath265 . at high energy",
    "the angular velocity @xmath40 is a simple increasing function of @xmath2 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : wsurf ] ) , but at low energy , near the ground states the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath40 becomes non  trivial .",
    "all these peculiarities can be understood if we study the mass distribution .",
    "we use two observables : the density of mass @xmath165 as a function of the radial distance ; and @xmath193 the density probability that the distance between two particles is @xmath194 . at",
    "fixed @xmath2 and at high energy the particles are randomly distributed over the disk ( gas phase ) ; if the energy decreases , at some threshold the system undergoes a phase transition of first order to a collapse phase .",
    "if @xmath4 there is a single cluster at the center of mass , if @xmath5 then there are two clusters rotating around the center of mass .",
    "their relative mass @xmath266 with @xmath267 is very large for low @xmath2 , it decreases as @xmath2 raises and eventually becomes 1 for @xmath2 larger than a certain threshold .",
    "clearly these two clusters phases were not reported in previous work because of the usual _ a priori _ assumption of rotaional symmetry .",
    "phase transitions ( and phases ) can be defined unambiguously in the microcanonical ensemble as a function of the _ local _ topology of @xmath3 .",
    "if all eigenvalues of @xmath59 , the jacobian of @xmath3 are negative then the system is in a pure phase .",
    "if ( at least ) one eigenvalue is positive , say @xmath61 , then there is a first order phase transition in the direction of @xmath69 , the eigenvector associated with @xmath61 .",
    "a critical behavior occurs when one ( or many ) eigenvalue vanishes on at least a second order region ( if @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "note that one can find positive , negative and zero eigenvalues at the same point in the parameter space . using these criteria",
    ", we can draw a phase diagram of the gravitational system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdet ] ) at fixed @xmath1 _ and _ @xmath2 : at high energy there is a pure gas phase ; at low energy there are several pure collapse phases , there is one cluster at @xmath4 and there are two clusters for @xmath268 ; these phases are separated by first order phase transition regions .",
    "there are also several second order phase transitions ; two of them are located at relativley high energies ( @xmath269 ) and therefore may be of astrophysical importance .    studying an isolated system using the canonical ensemble ( ce ) can be very misleading , since there is a massive loss of information from the correct microcanonical ensemble ( me ) description to the ce s one ( if there are phase transitions in me ) .",
    "in fact for the gravitational model , _ ce can not be sensitive to the two clusters phases and all the phase transitions _ and _ it is not defined for some values of the intensive parameters that exist in me _",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : beta - beta - gamma ] ) .",
    "of course we have just presented an _",
    "equilibirum statistical _ model that may help to understand the physics of globular clusters or collapsing molecular clouds and the results should be interpreted with caution especial in the case of star formation .",
    "a lot of `` ingredients '' are missing in order to have a complete picture of the formation of multiple stars systems and planetary systems , for instance the magnetic field  @xcite , or the presence of vortices  .",
    "phases and phase transitions can be well defined in the microcanonical ensemble ( me ) without invoking the thermodynamical limit by probing the curvature of the entropy surface .",
    "there still exists open problems .",
    "one of them is the scaling of a first order transition : in fig .",
    "[ fig : sex ] in a canonical sense the phase transition occurs from @xmath270 to @xmath271 ( if @xmath48 is the energy @xmath1 then @xmath272 is the transition latent heat ) , but for if one uses the me definition the transition occurs only from @xmath273 to @xmath274 . at the thermodynamical limit ,",
    "if it exists , such discrepancy should disappear . in another context ( a model of a first order liquid gas transition of finite ",
    "size sodium clusters ) we could show that @xmath275 when the system size goes to infinity .    the me definition of phase transitions offers a richer view of physical systems and phase transitions . again on fig .",
    "[ fig : sex ] , ce is not sensitive to everything that could happen under the maxwell line : there is always one transition . on the contrary ,",
    "in me there could be many phase transitions between @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "for example if there is a small positive curvature bump between @xmath273 and @xmath274 there would be two transitions in the microcanonical sense but still one in the canonical sense .",
