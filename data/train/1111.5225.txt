    "the theory of entanglement , originally developed in the field of quantum information theory , has recently become a very valuable tool to describe the phase diagram and the properties of strongly - correlated quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "for example , the study of the scaling of the entanglement entropy as a function of the system size has become the standard tool to detect the central charge in critical quantum spin chains @xcite , and the entanglement spectrum in topological insulators is providing a very nice characterization of the spectrum of the corresponding edge modes @xcite . also ,",
    "second - order quantum phase transitions are characterized by the emergence of a large amount of entanglement .",
    "almost all of those results were obtained in the zero - temperature regime , _",
    "i.e. _ , for ground states . in that regime ,",
    "all correlations are quantum correlations , and the subtleties of mixed - state quantum entanglement are avoided . from the point of view of quantum systems at finite temperature , interesting questions about separability , entanglement cost and entanglement of distillation could in principle be posed , but those concepts do not seem to have any clear operational meaning in the context of a quantum many - body system as there is no clear separation of the different degrees of freedom in that case . indeed , at finite temperature , it seems to make much more sense to look at the total correlations in the system , without trying to distinguish classical from quantum degrees of freedom : it is precisely the fact that ( quasi- ) long range correlations emerge in the many - body system that makes them so interesting , and whether those correlations are quantum or classical is a question that would anyway depend on the way the system is partitioned and on the definition of entanglement .",
    "the most appealing quantity that measures the total amount of correlations in a quantum system is the mutual information . for pure ( zero - temperature ) states it reduces to twice the entanglement entropy , and effectively quantifies the amount of ( shannon ) information we acquire about the configuration of part of the system by measuring another part .",
    "for instance , in the case of an ising ferromagnet at zero temperature , the mutual information between two parts of the system is one bit , as the measurement of the spins in one part reveals one bit of information ( up or down ) about the configuration of the spins in the other part . in such purely classical cases ,",
    "the behavior of the mutual information as a function of the temperature and the system size is very intriguing and has been discussed in refs .  .",
    "the really nice features of the mutual information are that : ( @xmath0 ) it provides a natural way of extending the study of entanglement entropy to the case of finite temperature ;",
    "( @xmath1 ) it has a nice operational interpretation ; ( @xmath2 ) it provides a measure of all correlations in a quantum many - body system , not just the two- or three - body correlations .",
    "this last point is of special importance when studying collective models such as the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite , where there is no clear notion of locality .",
    "the goal of this paper is to initiate the study of the behavior of the mutual information in quantum many - body systems at finite temperature following recent studies @xcite .",
    "questions that will be addressed include , _",
    "e.g. _ , the study of how the scaling of the mutual information depends on the temperature , and how precisely the mutual information allows one to identify phase transitions .",
    "we will focus our attention on the lmg model , because it is a quantum many - body system that exhibits a nontrivial phase transition with true many - body correlations , while still being simple enough such that the calculation of the mutual information is tractable .",
    "we will show that the mutual information yields precise information about the location of the phase transition .",
    "an intriguing difference in its finite - size scaling is obtained between the zero versus non - zero temperature case .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath3 fully - connected spins 1/2 whose hamiltonian reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total - spin operator along the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 direction , @xmath9 being the usual pauli matrix at site @xmath10 . without loss of generality , we suppose that @xmath11 .",

    ", following recent works in two - dimensional quantum spin systems @xcite , we wish to investigate the same problem at finite temperature .",
    "concerning the lmg model , the concurrence @xcite ( which characterizes the entanglement between two spins in an arbitrary state ) is up to now the only entanglement measure that has been computed both at zero @xcite and at finite temperature @xcite .",

    "alternatively , one may consider the negativity @xcite that is also a good measure for mixed states and that is not restricted to two - spin correlations .",
    "this measure has been successfully used to study the quantum phase transition in the lmg model @xcite and other fully - connected models @xcite .",
    "it is however already difficult to compute at zero temperature , so one can expect troubles to obtain it at finite temperature for systems of decent sizes ( analytical expressions in the thermodynamical limit being out of reach ) . to our knowledge , apart from these two measures ( concurrence and negativity ) , there exists only one reliable quantity susceptible to be used for mixed states , namely the mutual information , whose definition is based on entanglement entropy .    to obtain informations about many - body correlations of a system ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is usually the measure of choice for pure states .",
    "it is defined as the entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath68 obtained , after partitioning the system into two parts @xmath69 and @xmath70 , by tracing out the density matrix @xmath71 over subsystem @xmath70  : @xmath72 . for pure states ,",
    "the same entropy is obtained if one exchanges @xmath69 and @xmath70 , although the result obviously depends on the bipartition . for mixed states , however , the entanglement entropy is dominated by a contribution related to the total entropy of the system under consideration ( which vanishes for pure states ) .",
    "therefore , the natural thing to do is to subtract this total entropy in a suitable way .",
    "this leads to the following definition of the mutual information @xmath73 where the von neumann entropy @xmath74 is the quantum generalization of the shannon entropy .",
    "the shannon entropy provides an asymptotic description of the properties of a system ( a probability distribution of states ) , in the sense that it describes the average number of bits needed to encode a state of the system .",
    "this average is taken over all the states of the system , using their respective probabilities of occurrence .",
    "in other words , shannon entropy corresponds to the average amount of randomness that can be extracted from the system . note that it is also possible to work with rnyi entropies defined as @xcite , but let us simply underline that when @xmath75 , they become identical to the aforementioned shannon / von neumann version that is considered in the following .    before discussing the results , it is important to understand that mutual information is _ not _ a measure for the `` quantumness '' of a system : it captures both classical and quantum correlations alike . to make the distinction between both",
    ", one could rather study the so - called quantum discord @xcite .",
    "however , such a measure is clearly artificial as the quantum discord of two states arbitrarily close to each other can vanish for one of them and be positive for the other one @xcite .",
    "such mixed - state entanglement measures were constructed from the point of view of delocalized systems , and do not necessarily make sense in the context of condensed - matter systems .    in the present work , we shall not try to distinguish between quantum and classical correlations and will stick to computing the mutual information . indeed",

    "[ fig : density_mi ] . following a ray in the @xmath33 plane of this figure",

    "[ subsec : results ] for a confirmation of this ) , one might thus argue that @xmath76 detects the phase transition at least as well as usual thermodynamic quantities such as the order parameter or the heat capacity discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : diagram ] .",
