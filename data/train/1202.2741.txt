    "this is done to keep always clear that the stable and unstable motions are in some sense described by the same analytic functions .",
    "our first aim is to obtain canonical coordinates @xmath2 , in the vicinity of the proper rotations , such that the hamiltonian , at fixed total angular momentum @xmath3 , becomes a function of the product @xmath4 ( near unstable proper rotations ) or of @xmath5 ( near the stable ones ) .",

    "the canonical coordinates are therefore completely determined , eq . , ( together with eq . ) .",
    "the latter expressions are still quite implicit and in sec.[sec5 ] we bring them to a form suitable for the evaluation of the integrating coordinates via computable power series ; and as an example a few terms of the scaling functions @xmath9 and of the normal form of the hamiltonian are evaluated , eq . , .",

    "in this case we prove that some of the new polynomials have all roots on the unit circle ( with the help of theorems on the location of zeros of symmetric polynomials ) : and we conjecture a relation with the lee - yang theorem for the zeros of `` ferromagnetic polynomials '' .    in sec.[sec7 ]",
