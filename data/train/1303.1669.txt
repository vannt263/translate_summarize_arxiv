    "the multipole moments of a newtonian mass distribution can be determined in different ways .",
    "first , we can expand the gravitational potential far away from the source .",
    "the coefficients of the resulting series are then identified with the multipole moments .",
    "secondly , the moments of the mass density @xmath0 , i.e. integrals of products of @xmath0 and certain polynomials , equal the multipole moments . for instance",
    ", we have for axially symmetric distributions and the multipole moments @xmath1 in polar coordinates @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denote the legendre polynomials of the first kind and @xmath5 is the support of @xmath0 .",
    "geometric units are chosen such that @xmath6 .",
    "that these two definitions are equivalent is not trivial but can be proved using the poisson integral . in general relativity ,",
    "both types of definitions exist but they are in general not equivalent .",
    "the first type of definition involves only the gravitational field close to space - like or null - like infinity and it yields _ asymptotic multipole moments _ ( or field multipole moments@xcite ) .",
    "this approach was taken in refs .  ,",
    "for reviews see ref .  .",
    "the second type of definitions characterizes solely the source and will be called _ source multipole moments _ or _ source integrals_. such definitions were put forward , e.g. in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , we show that both types of definitions can be related to each other also in general relativity , i.e. , we give a source integral formulation of asymptotic multipole moments .",
    "details of the calculations can be found in refs . .",
    "such a formalism has many applications , e.g. in the description of tidal deformations of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "it also allows to characterize exact and numerical solutions by their asymptotic multipole moments using only the metric in the interior of the matter .",
    "we give an example of that in the end of this paper .",
    "we concentrate on axially symmetric and static spacetimes . in weyl form",
    "they read : @xmath7 the metric functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 depend only on the weyl coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 . with the time - like and hypersurface orthogonal killing vector @xmath12 and the space - like killing vector @xmath13 ,",
    "the metric functions are given by @xmath14 furthermore , the killing vectors define a 1-form @xmath15 that is hypersurface orthogonal everywhere as well as exact in the vacuum region .",
    "hence , a potential @xmath16 and an integrating factor @xmath17 exist such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 in the exterior of a topological 2-sphere @xmath20 , which encloses all sources . in the vacuum region and in _",
    "canonical _ weyl coordinates , we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "since we can shift the @xmath11-coordinate freely , we can drop the constant of integration .",
    "it specifies the origin with respect to which the asymptotic multipole moments are introduced .",
    "using the canonical weyl coordinates , we can define weyl s asymptotic multipole moments @xmath23 covariantly via an expansion of @xmath24 along the axis of symmetry @xmath25 close to spatial infinity : @xmath26 the @xmath23 are sufficient to calculate the geroch - hansen multipole moments@xcite .    let us further introduce two sets of polynomials in @xmath27 and @xmath16 : @xmath28 @xmath29 denotes the greatest integer @xmath30 with @xmath31 . moreover",
    ", suppose that each black hole is enclosed by a topological 2-sphere @xmath32 that contains no other sources and assume that there is a ( not necessarily connected ) region @xmath33 in the projection orthogonal to @xmath12 that covers all matter .",
    "then the source integrals evaluate to@xcite @xmath34 , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the proper surface or volume element of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the derivative of @xmath38 in the direction of the unit normal of @xmath32 .",
    "we conclude the paper discussing one possible application of the source integrals .",
    "assume a matter distribution is given and the metric is known in @xmath33 .",
    "even then it is far from trivial ( at least in the stationary case@xcite ) to obtain a global asymptotically flat solution , if it exists .",
    "the source integrals provide a tool to solve this task .",
    "we demonstrated the procedure for static dust configurations in refs .  .",
    "there we showed that all asymptotic multipole moments of static and axially symmetric dust configurations can be calculated and that they all vanish .",
    "this contradicts the presence of a dust distribution with a positive mass density . of course , this result",
    "is already known and more general non - existence results for dust including the rotating case can be found in refs .   and references therein .",
    "although the non - existence was proved@xcite , this example shows in a concise way how the source integrals can be applied in more difficult physical situations like rotating relativistic stars .",
    "this and other applications , e.g. to tidal distortions of black holes , will be investigated in future work .",
