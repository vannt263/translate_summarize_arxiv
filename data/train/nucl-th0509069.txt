    "<S> @xcite analyzed a total of 46 fusion excitation functions at energies above the average fusion barriers using the woods - saxon form for the nuclear potential in a barrier passing model of fusion . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the empirical diffuseness parameters @xmath0 ranging between 0.75 and 1.5 were considerably larger than those obtained from elastic scattering data and the deduced @xmath0 showed strong increase with increasing the charge product @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> the fusion coupled channel model is successful for describing fusion excitation function of heavy - ion reaction at energies near fusion barrier . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the increasing of the neutron excess and the charges ( the product @xmath1 ) of two nuclei , the fusion coupled channel model encounters a lot of difficulties due to a very large number of degrees of freedom involved . in order to carry out a systematic study of fusion excitation functions , a simple and useful approach seems to be required . a semi - empirical approach in which the quantum penetrability of coulumb barrier is calculated by using the concept of barrier distribution arising due to </S>",

    "<S> the density functional theory is widely used in the study of the nuclear ground state which provides us with a useful balance between accuracy and computation cost allowing large systems with a simple self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is very suitable to perform the calculation of the entrance - channel potential and the densities of reaction partners based on the same skyrme energy density functional . of course , the different density distributions obtained by different approaches will influence the entrance - channel potential . while a self - consistent treatment for both density distribution and the entrance - channel potential seems to be more reasonable .    in this work , </S>",

    "<S> , the fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies are under - predicted when @xmath82 . for this case , a small @xmath84 should be taken so that the distribution @xmath88 is broaden and thus the fusion cross sections are enhanced at sub - barrier energies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when @xmath89 the sub - barrier fusion cross sections can be reproduced well ( see fig.10(b ) ) . through systematically analyzing the fusion excitation functions of reactions between nuclei with neutron closed - shell but near the @xmath90-stability line and those with neutron - rich nuclei , we find that fusion cross sections are suppressed for the former cases and enhanced for the latter cases compared to the calculation results with @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of fusion cross sections for reactions with neutron - rich nuclei compared with non - neutron - rich nuclei has been found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is attributed to the neutron transfer and neck formation which lower the fusion barrier and thus enhance the fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies@xcite . for neutron closed - shell nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> the strong shell effect suppresses the lowering barrier effect . </S>",
    "<S> based on above discussion we propose an empirical formula for the @xmath84 values used in the weighing function @xmath88 for systems with the same @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the difference between the q - value of the system under considering for complete fusion and that of the reference system . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we introduce a truncation for @xmath84 value , i.e. @xmath84 should not be smaller than 0.5 .    the reference system is chosen to be the reaction system with nuclei along the @xmath90-stability line . more precisely , we do it as follows : from the periodic table we find the relative atomic masses of corresponding elements of projectile and target ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) , then the mass numbers for reaction partners of reference system ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) can be obtained by inequality @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath107 denotes projectile ( @xmath108 ) or target ( @xmath109 ) nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for three fusion reactions @xmath71o+@xmath110zr , @xmath71o+@xmath61zr reaction system is taken to be the reference system according to the atomic mass of o and zr obtained from periodic table and inequality given above . </S>",
    "<S> if there exist certain reaction system for which the experimental data of fusion excitation function can be reproduced well by the calculations with @xmath82 , then this reaction system is preferably chosen as the reference system for the series of reactions with the same @xmath91 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the series of reactions of @xmath71o+sm , the reaction @xmath71o+@xmath111sm is taken as the reference system because the experimental data can be reproduced by the calculations with @xmath82 ( see the following discussion ) . for this kind of reactions , there may exist possibility of more than one such reaction systems for which the experimental data can be described by the calculations with @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation might be rare and from our investigation we have not encountered . if this situation occurs we prefer to choosing the reference system according to the inequality given above . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath84 values for some fusion reactions with neutron closed - shell nuclei or neutron - rich nuclei are calculated by expression ( 25 ) and the results are listed in table.ii . for fusion reactions between nuclei with neutron closed - shell and near the @xmath90-stability line , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath84 values are larger than 1 ( see table.ii ) , which means that the width of the barrier distribution @xmath88 becomes narrow and thus the fusion cross sections of these systems at sub - barrier energies are suppressed compared with the reference system . </S>",
    "<S> fig.11 shows the fusion excitation functions of these fusion reactions . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from the figure that the experimental data are nicely reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that at energies near and above the fusion barrier , calculated fusion cross sections are not sensitive to the value of @xmath84 ( see fig.10 and fig.12(a ) and fig.12(f ) ) , which implies that we can calculate the fusion cross sections at energies near and above the fusion barrier for unmeasured fusion system by simply taking @xmath82 in our parametrization of weighing function . for sub - barrier fusion , more sophisticated investigation for @xmath84 value is required . for further investigating the influence of @xmath84 value , a series of fusion reactions with @xmath71o projectile on sm isotope targets from @xmath112sm to @xmath87sm </S>",
    "<S> are studied . </S>",
    "<S> fig.12 shows the fusion excitation functions for @xmath71o + @xmath113sm . in the calculations we find that the fusion cross sections for @xmath71o+@xmath111sm can be reproduced well by the calculations with @xmath82 ( see fig.12(b ) ) , </S>",
    "<S> so this system is taken as a reference system for studying other @xmath71o+@xmath113sm . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath114 for @xmath71o+@xmath112sm is negative as obtained from table.ii and consequently the corresponding @xmath84 value calculated by expression ( 25 ) is larger than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this fusion process is unfavored and the fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies are suppressed compared with reference system @xmath71o+@xmath111sm . with the increase in numbers of neutrons , the q - values of reaction under consideration increase gradually and the corresponding @xmath84 values decrease , which indicates that the sub - barrier fusion cross sections change from suppression to enhancement compared with the reference system . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated results for o+sm reactions are in good agreement with the experimental data . for investigating the competition between suppression and enhancement effect of fusion cross sections , </S>",

    "<S> we find that those reactions with @xmath122 are all enhanced at sub - barrier energies compared with non - neutron - rich systems , while those reactions with @xmath123 are all suppressed at sub - barrier fusion compared with neutron non - closed - shell systems .    for radioactive beam fusion reactions @xmath124sn+@xmath125ni , </S>",
    "<S> the competition exists since @xmath124sn is both neutron - rich and neutron - shell - closure ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath84 value for this reaction is smaller than 1 ( see table.ii ) and the enhancement of the fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies is expected . </S>",
