    "in this work we calculate two pion distribution amplitudes ( @xmath0das ) and pion skewed parton distributions ( @xmath1spds ) in the instanton motivated , effective chiral quark model . @xmath0das and @xmath1spds are defined as fourier transforms of matrix elements of certain light - cone operators , taken between the pion states . @xmath0das",
    "appear in the amplitude for the process @xmath2 , if the virtuality of the photon is much larger then the squared invariant mass of the two pion system @xcite .",
    "@xmath0das describe the transition from partons to two pions in a final state .",
    "they are also related to the pion electromagnetic form factor in the time like region and pion electromagnetic radius .",
    "the process @xmath2 can be related by crossing symmetry to virtual compton scattering @xmath3 .",
    "this process factorizes into a hard photon - parton scattering and @xmath1spds @xcite@xcite . in the forward limit the latter reduce to the quark densities which are measurable in the @xmath4p drell - yan process or",
    "prompt photon production @xcite .",
    "finally certain integral of @xmath1spds gives pion electromagnetic form factor in the space like region .",
    "pions are the simplest hadronic states being @xmath5 pairs and goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry at the same time .",
    "therefore their properties may be calculated with little dynamical input , relying on their chiral structure and chiral symmetry breaking . in this work",
    "we use the instanton motivated effective chiral quark model @xcite with nonlocal interactions .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to the calculation of the leading twist pion distribution amplitude @xcite@xcite , @xmath0das @xcite@xcite and pion spds @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of the model is the momentum dependence of the constituent quark mass which regularizes certain , otherwise divergent , integrals . to make the calculation feasible",
    "this momentum dependence has been taken in the form @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the constituent quark mass at zero momentum .",
    "its value , obtained from the _ gap _ equation , is approximately @xmath8 mev .",
    "quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are model parameters .",
    "as explained below we expect the model to be roughly independent of @xmath9 , if the value of @xmath11 is properly adjusted .",
    "the formula ( [ m ] ) maybe thought to be instanton motivated in a sense , that when continued to euclidean momenta ( @xmath12 ) , it reproduces reasonably well @xcite the momentum dependence calculated explicitly @xcite in the instanton model of the qcd vacuum : @xmath13 - 2i_{1}(z)k_{1}(z ) , \\label{minst}%\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being an average instanton size .    the calculations presented here may be viewed as an extension of the previous results of refs.@xcite@xcite and were partially reported in @xcite .",
    "our motivations are both theoretical and phenomenological .",
    "first , the asymptotics of eq.([minst ] ) suggests @xmath16 in eq.([m ] ) , however , taking the non - integer @xmath9 results in additional difficulties . in the previous works @xcite@xcite the value",
    "@xmath17 was assumed .",
    "therefore it should be checked that the results do not depend strongly on @xmath9 .",
    "this is indeed true for the pion distribution amplitude , as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "secondly in @xcite@xcite the momentum dependence of the constituent mass in the quark propagators was neglected . with the method developed in @xcite we can calculate generalized parton distributions for arbitrary @xmath9 , keeping track of momentum dependence of the constituent quark mass both in numerators and denominators even for the convergent quantities",
    "this is in fact necessary if one insists on the soft pion theorems which would be otherwise not fulfilled .",
    "apart from a well known soft pion theorem for a chirally even @xmath0da @xcite , we derive ( in the framework of the present model ) a soft pion theorem for a chirally odd @xmath0da .    on the phenomenological side , apart from the calculation of the pion generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas for short ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath0das and @xmath1spds themselves , we calculate pion electromagnetic radius , electromagnetic form factor and quark distributions , and compare them with the existing data .",
    "this comparison although not bad , is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "we shall discuss our results in sect.[sect : sum ] .",
    "we start with the short description of the model in sect.[model ] then , in sect.[def & prop ] , we proceed with definitions of @xmath0das and @xmath18spds and their general properties . in sect.[model_gda ] we sketch the calculations and present numerical results . in sect.[softpions ] we demonstrate soft pion theorems .",
    "finally , in sect.[strucfun ] , we discuss pion quark densities calculated in the model and compare them with data and other theoretical calculations .",
    "technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "for two quark flavors ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) the effective model we use to calculate pion gdas is given by the action ( in momentum space ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 the matrix @xmath23   = 1+\\frac{i}{f_{\\pi}}\\gamma^{5}\\tau^{a}\\pi^{a}(x)-\\frac { 1}{2f_{\\pi}^{2}}\\pi^{a}(x)\\pi^{a}(x)+\\ldots\\label{u}%\\ ] ] ( in coordinate space ) gives the interaction between quarks and pions .",
    "there is no kinetic term for the pions and the pion field is treated as an external source .",

    "the momentum dependence of the quark constituent mass is given by eq.([m ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11 parameter is fixed once for all by adjusting the value of @xmath30 calculated in the effective model ( [ s ] ) to its physical value @xmath24 mev .",
    "this has been done in @xcite .",
    "for example for @xmath31 mev and @xmath17 we have obtained @xmath32 mev .",
    "neither @xmath7 nor @xmath11 should be identified with the normalization scale @xmath33 of the quantities calculated in the model .",

    "one of the major problems of the effective models like the one considered here , is the normalization scale @xmath33 at which the model is defined .",
    "this is crucial shortcoming as far as the comparison with the experimental data is concerned .",
    "it is argued that the relevant scale for the instanton motivated models is of the order of the inverse instanton size @xmath222 _ i.e. _ approximately 600 mev .",
    "the precise definition of @xmath33 is only possible within qcd and in all effective models one can use only qualitative _ order of magnitude _ arguments to estimate @xmath33 .",
    "a more practical way to determine @xmath33 was discussed in ref.@xcite where we associated @xmath33 with the transverse integration cutoff @xmath223 which was of the order of @xmath224  mev .",
    "on the other hand in refs.@xcite it was argued that the pertinent model scale may be as small as 350 mev .",
    "this estimate is based on the requirement that the total momentum carried by the quarks equals to the one measured experimentally at @xmath225  gev@xmath226 , _ i.e. _ 47% . in that way the initial evolution scale @xmath33 can be adjusted .",
    "it is , however , problematic whether one can use qcd evolution equations at such low @xmath33 .",

    "this suggests that rather than compare model results for pion parton distributions with the ones extracted from the data it is perhaps more appropriate to calculate the cross section itself and compare directly with the data .",

    "although in qcd this is certainly a correct definition , one might envisage alternative definitions which would be more appropriate for the nonlocal effective models @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in the limit when the quark operators are taken in the same point , quark billinears ( [ 2pida_def],[spd_def ] ) do not correspond to the properly normalized noether currents .",
    "this is because in the nonlocal models noether currents get additional pieces which restore ward - takahashi identities @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how to generalize quark billinears ( [ 2pida_def],[spd_def ] ) , since such generalization is , in principle , process dependent .",
    "therefore an alternative way would be to calculate the whole scattering amplitude directly in the effective model and then extract the quantities one is interested in by imposing certain kinematical constraints , like bjorken limit for example .",
    "although this procedure seems at the first sight attractive , there is a problem because the bjorken limit requires large momentum transfer , whereas the effective models are defined at low momenta .",

    "this causes the problem , as in the model we use , the pion is built from constituent quarks ( there are no gluons ) so there is 7% of the pion momentum missing .",
