    "the euclidean path integral formulation of quantum field theory is the origin of fundamental approaches to the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the nonperturbative regime . while the lattice regularization of the path integral",

    "it will be clearly stated which properties are fundamental symmetries of qcd and which properties depend on the actual dynamics of qcd . as such , the following equalities must be met by any model which hopes to capture the essence of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the only approximation made in the following discussion of qcd equalities is the equivalence of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 current quark masses .",

    "thus , the simple quark model always did predict some strangeness in the nucleon .",
    "as we will see , the amount may be determined through a measure of isospin symmetry violation and ratios of light to strange constituent quark masses .",

    "the disconnected sea - quark loop contribution of ( [ decloopest ] ) applied to the @xmath119 is precisely the contribution required to augment the earlier reported @xcite valence sector contribution of @xmath120 to @xmath121 and restore agreement with the new precision measurement of the @xmath119 magnetic moment @xcite of @xmath122 .",

    "octet baryon moments with the disconnected sea - quark loop contributions of ( [ octetloops ] ) are also indicated in table [ magmompred ] to provide some reference on the reliability of the predictions .",
    "it is remarkable that a single scale parameter applied to the lattice qcd results is all that is required to reproduce the octet baryon magnetic moments within uncertainties .",
    "the essential ingredients to any model which hopes to reproduce these moments are an environment sensitivity of the quark sector contributions and a small but essential disconnected sea - quark contribution .",
    "the idea that the contributions of various flavors running around the disconnected sea loop might be estimated by considering ratios of constituent quark masses is not new @xcite .",
    "however , the connection between quarks running around the disconnected loop and constituent quarks is obscured by the fact that constituent quarks are usually associated with the valence quark sector carrying the quantum numbers of the hadron .",
    "however , @xmath0pt and the qcd equalities presented here have provided a quantitative link between the two , consistent to @xmath1 and one - loop in @xmath0pt .    with this new relationship , the strangeness contribution to nucleon moments may be isolated .",

    "the sector contributions @xmath146 of @xmath147 for the proton are sufficiently different from the traditionally viewed simple quark model contributions of @xmath148 to be interesting . similarly , the neutron sector contributions are @xmath149 to be compared with @xmath150 in the traditional simple quark model .",
    "it is interesting to note that when isospin symmetry breaking in the @xmath3-@xmath4 moments is used to isolate the strangeness contribution in the simple quark model , the quark sector contributions of @xmath151 for the proton and @xmath152 for the neutron look more similar to the predictions from lattice qcd and qcd equalities .",
    "using valence sector information coupled with experiment where available , or chiral perturbation theory , we have seen how qcd equalities can be used to gain insight into sea - quark contributions , and in particular , strangeness contributions to nucleon properties .",
    "the qcd equalities were derived for a general quark current , bilinear in the quark fields .    here , the focus in practice has been on the magnetic properties of baryons . in particular , the disconnected sea - quark loop contribution to the nucleon moment is determined to be @xmath153 , and the strange quark contributes @xmath154 to the loop . for decuplet baryons , the disconnected sea - quark loop contribution is estimated to be @xmath155 , of which @xmath156 has its origin from the strange quark .",
    "the qcd equalities have also resolved the equivalence of @xmath0pt to @xmath1 and the simple quark model with an explicit disconnected sea - quark contribution .",
    "new relationships between su(3)-flavor symmetry breaking in valence and sea contributions were obtained .",
    "moreover , an implicit strangeness contribution was identified in simple constituent quark models where isospin symmetry between the @xmath3 and @xmath4-quark moments , @xmath157 , is broken .    the techniques demonstrated here may be applied to other observables of quark current operators . for example , the strangeness radius of the nucleon might be extracted from a study of experimentally measured nucleon form factors and models of @xmath110 and @xmath109 form factors .",
    "favorable combinations could be found which minimize the model dependence .",
    "finally , it is hoped that these equalities will be useful in the development of more sophisticated models of qcd .",
    "as one considers the possible refinements of quark models , it is important to maintain the symmetries of qcd .",
