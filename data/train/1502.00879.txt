    "the present paper is the second part of a longstanding tripartite study aimed at realizing , for @xmath0factorial projective toric varieties , a classification inspired by what v.  batyrev did in 1991 for smooth complete toric varieties @xcite .",

    "roughly speaking , by adopting the usual terminology for toric varieties of picard number 1 , called _ fake wps _ as suitable finite quotients of a weighted projective space ( wps , for short ) , such a generalization can be stated by saying that _ every @xmath0factorial complete toric variety is a fake pws_. section [ sez:1covering ] is entirely devoted to explaining this fact .",
    "the main result is given by theorem  [ thm : covering&quotient ] : the group action realizing the quotient is determined by the torsion subgroup @xmath2 of the classes group @xmath3 of the given @xmath0factorial complete toric variety @xmath4 , and it is represented by a suitable _ torsion matrix _ @xmath5 . in other words",

    "finally section [ sez : fan ] is dedicated to reconstructing a fan matrix @xmath9 , in the sense of definition [ def : fmatrice ] , of a @xmath0factorial complete toric variety @xmath4 , assigned by means of a weight matrix @xmath6 and a torsion matrix @xmath5 . here",
