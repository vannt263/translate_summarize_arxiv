    "stars are formed in the dense and cold cloud cores within molecular clouds . in the current paradigm for star formation , the gravitational collapse of a slowly rotating cloud core leads to the formation of a central protostar surrounded by a rotating disk and an overlying envelope from which the material rains down onto the disk @xcite .",
    "high angular momentum material in the envelope first collapses into a disk before getting accreted onto the central protostar . in the early embedded stages ,",
    "the system drives powerful bipolar jets / outflows , the origin of which is not entirely understood . as the system evolves , the envelope dissipates either by draining onto the disk or is cleared out by stellar winds and outflows , leaving behind a young pre - main sequence star surrounded by a disk .",
    "planetary systems are formed out of such protoplanetary disks which are the natural byproducts of star formation process .    in the widely accepted ` core accretion ' model ,",
    "the planet formation process begins with the sub@xmath0-sized grains in protoplanetary disks sticking together to grow into larger mm- and cm - sized particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as they grow , the larger grains sink down to the disk mid - plane ; sedimentation of the dust can cause significant changes in the vertical structure of the disk @xcite . along with the grain growth , mineralization of the initially amorphous dust grains also takes place in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the larger grains that have settled to the disk mid - plane further grow into km - sized planetesimals , which through collisional growth , eventually form protoplanets ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "once these ` planetary embryos ' have become sufficiently massive ( @xmath1  m@xmath2 ) , they accrete gas from the disks to form giant planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a jupiter - like gas giant formed in the disk can gravitationally alter the disk structure by forming radial gaps and holes in them @xcite .",
    "the disks eventually dissipate either by planet formation processes clearing the disks and/or by various other disk dispersal processes such as accretion onto the central star , photoevaporation and magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) induced disk clearing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the various evolutionary stages that young stars go through have traditionally been classified on the basis of their observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the continuum spectral index , @xmath3 , evaluated between 2 and 20  @xmath0 has been used for this classification @xcite . under this scheme , objects with a rising infrared continuum ( @xmath4 ) are classified as class  i sources and objects with flat infrared continuum ( @xmath5 ) as ` flat spectrum sources ' ; class  ii objects have infrared continuum slope @xmath6 and class  iii sources show marginal infrared excess with @xmath7 .",
    "these empirical sed classes roughly correspond to the different physical stages in the theoretical model : the class  i sources have a collapsing envelope surrounding the protostar - disk system ; the class  ii sources have dissipated most of their envelope and are characterized by a pre - main sequence star surrounded by a disk ; the disk dissipation is well underway in class  iii sources .",
    "an additional class , class  0 , was introduced later to represent objects in an evolutionary stage prior to that of class  i , where the mass in the envelope is substantially higher than that of the central protostar @xcite .",
    "traditional sed classes , however , may not always represent the actual physical evolutionary stages as described above , particularly in regions of high extinction : a highly extinguished class  ii object could easily be misclassified as a flat spectrum or a class  i source @xcite .",
    "the number of objects in various sed classes have been used to estimate the relative lifetimes of the evolutionary stages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such studies carried out before the _ spitzer _",
    "era yielded an average lifetime of @xmath8  myr for the class  0 phase @xcite and @xmath9  myr for class  i phase @xcite .",
    "many of these studies suffered from small number statistics and possible differences in the earlier evolutionary classes between clouds .",
    "the large _",
    "survey of five nearby molecular clouds by the _ c2d _ team have significantly improved the data statistics @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of the protostellar evolutionary classes are estimated from the number counts of objects in various sed classes , under the assumptions of continuous star formation and a mean lifetime of 2  myr for the class  ii objects .",
    "the mean lifetime for the class  i phase was found to be @xmath10  myr with an additional 0.4  myr for the flat sed phase @xcite .",
    "the average lifetime derived for the class  0 phase is @xmath11  myr .",
    "these lifetimes are significantly longer than most of the earlier estimates in the literature @xcite .",
    "most of the stellar mass is built during the embedded protostellar phase which lasts for @xmath12  myr @xcite .",
    "a steady accretion rate of @xmath13 m@xmath14  yr@xmath15 would then be required to build a 0.5  m@xmath14 star , which corresponds to an accretion luminosity of l@xmath16 = 6  l@xmath14 .",
    "however , the observed median bolometric luminosity of most of the class  i protostars in the nearby clouds is @xmath17  l@xmath14 @xcite , significantly smaller than the expected accretion luminosity .",
    "moreover , the observed luminosity is an upper limit for l@xmath16 : only a small fraction of l@xmath18 is attributable to accretion @xcite .",
    "this ` luminosity problem ' of protostars , first recognized by @xcite , is essentially an accretion rate problem : the observed accretion rates in class  i protostars are significantly smaller than those required to build a star during the embedded protostellar phase .",
    "the _ spitzer _ observations of protostars in the nearby clouds confirm the ` luminosity problem ' @xcite .",
    "the observed l@xmath18 of most class  i sources are significantly lower than those predicted by the standard infall models with steady accretion @xcite .",
    "the l@xmath18 distribution shows a dispersion of several orders of magnitude , with a few objects displaying higher l@xmath18 values than predicted by the models .",

    "the observed distribution of l@xmath18 of the class  i protostars in nearby clouds is better explained by protostellar evolutionary models with episodic mass accretion , rather than those with steady accretion @xcite .",
    "all the available evidence seem to indicate that the accretion onto the protostar during the embedded phase is non - steady and time variable .",
    "this was first proposed by @xcite , who suggested that the accretion during the embedded phase must be episodic with prolonged periods of very low accretion .",
    "most the of the stellar mass is built during the high accretion events .",
    "it has been suggested that the high accretion stage of the protostellar phase corresponds to the fu  ori objects @xcite .",
    "fu  ori systems exhibit sudden increases in brightness ( @xmath19  mag ) and remain luminous or decay slowly over decades @xcite .",
    "the fu  ori outbursts are believed to be caused by the rapid increase in the accretion rates which can be as high as @xmath20  m@xmath14  yr@xmath15 during the outburst @xcite . in the low accretion state of the protostars , the material falling in from the envelope onto the disk at a much higher rate , piles up in the outer disk .",
    "the accumulation of the material makes the disks unstable ; the onset of thermal or gravitational instabilities in the disk then transfers the bulk of the disk material onto the central star at high accretion rates , which is observed as the brief high luminosity fu  ori outburst @xcite .",
    "the envelope infall signatures in class  0/class  i protostars have been observed in the molecular lines in the submm and mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , these observations typically trace spatial scales of @xmath21  pc and densities of @xmath22  @xmath23 and thus probe large scale infall motions in the envelopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "direct observational evidence for the material falling onto the embedded disks in a protostar has been lacking until recently . the freely falling envelope material which acquires supersonic terminal infall velocities is thought to be decelerated within the accretion shocks at the disk surface @xcite .",
    "one of the most important _ spitzer _ discoveries in protostellar studies has been the detection of the arrival of infalling envelope material on the disk in an envelope - disk accretion shock , through the mid - infrared emission lines of water and oh lines observed in protostars viewed face - on with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "this was first detected in ngc  1333-iras  4b , which shows a rich emission - line spectrum of water and oh @xcite ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the relative intensities of the water lines indicate their origin in extremely dense ( @xmath24  @xmath23 ) and warm ( @xmath25  k ) gas .",
    "detailed modeling shows that the gas is heated by a low velocity ( @xmath26  km  s@xmath15 ) envelope - disk accretion shock , caused by the envelope material landing on the disk in an annulus of @xmath27  au .",
    "the rate at which the envelope material is falling on the disk , obtained from the total water line luminosity under the assumption of water line emission being the major coolant , is found to be @xmath28  m@xmath14 yr@xmath15 , quite similar to the envelope infall rates estimated from molecular line observations ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite carried out a survey of 85 face - on class  0/class  i protostars within 500  pc , with the _ spitzer _ irs high resolution modules to look for signatures of envelope - disk accretion and outflows in them .",
    "they detected water and oh lines in roughly half of their sample .",
    "an example of this , the high resolution mid - ir spectrum of iras  13036 - 7644 , which is a bright class  0 source in the small cloud dc303.8 - 14.2 towards chamaeleon ii , is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "the modeling of the spectra of the protostars , which show mid - ir emission lines of water and oh , indicates that the conditions in the envelope - disk accretion shock in them are similar to that found for iras4b . with the new diagnostic of envelope - disk accretion rate made available by _ spitzer _",
    ", it is now possible to compare the various flows in a protostellar system . in figure  [ fig2 ] the envelope - disk infall rate of the observed protostars",
    "is compared to the protostellar accretion plus outflow rate .",
    "the envelope - disk infall rate is estimated from the total luminosity of the water lines observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the protostellar accretion rate is computed from l@xmath18 , assuming @xmath29  =  @xmath30 , following the prescription of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outflow rate is computed from the luminosity of [ si  ii ] line at 34.8 @xmath0 in the irs spectra . the [ si  ii ] line is a good proxy for the [ o  i ] 63.2 @xmath0 line which measures the outflow rates , as it is a dominant coolant for densities of @xmath31  @xmath23 and outflow speeds of @xmath32  km  s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig2 ] that the envelope infall rates derived from water and oh lines for most protostars are at least an order of magnitude higher than the protostellar accretion and the outflow rate .",
    "this indicates that material is piling up in the disk and is not efficiently accreted onto the star or carried out by the outflow .",
    "this could eventually lead to fu  ori - like outburst which is caused when the material that is accumalated in the disk is accreted onto the central protostar in a massive accretion event .",
    "thus , the flow imbalance in protostars , measured from their mid - ir spectra , is consistent with , and argues strongly for episodic accretion in protostars .",
    "the embedded phase in the protostellar evolution ends after most of the envelope mass has been transferred to the central star through the disk . a pre - main sequence star surrounded by an accretion disk",
    "is left behind . in such class",
    "ii objects , the emission from protoplanetary disks dominates the sed longward of 2 @xmath0 .",
    "the thermal emission from the dust grains in the disks , heated by the stellar radiation , is responsible for the excess emission in these young stars .",
    "the optically thin emission from the dust grains in the surface layers of the disk produces the silicate emission features centered at 10 and 20 @xmath0 seen in the mid - ir spectra . the optically thick emission from the deeper layers and the disk midplane dominates the mid - ir continuum .",
    "the detailed shape of the mid - ir continuum is related to the disk geometry and could be used to probe the vertical and radial structure of the disks @xcite .",
    "the silicate emission features inform us on the size , shape and composition of dust grains in the disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "_ spitzer _ observations in the mid - ir , probe the planet forming regions ( @xmath33  au ) of protoplanetary disks @xcite and thus provide powerful diagnostics for the structure and evolution and the dust mineralogy of these disks .",
    "most solar - mass stars younger than @xmath34  myr appear to harbor disks around them ; by @xmath35  myr most of them shed their disks @xcite .",
    "clues to the planet formation and disk dissipation processes must therefore be sought in @xmath36  myr protoplanetary disks where disk evolution in ` action ' could be studied .",
    "below , i summarize the results from the large _ spitzer _ irs survey of protoplanetary disks in the nearby @xmath36  myr old star forming regions of taurus , chamaeleon i ( cha i ) and ophiuchus carried out by the _ irs_disks _ team ( pi : dan m. watson ) .",
    "the first step towards planet formation is the growth of sub@xmath0-sized grains in protoplanetary disks via coagulation .",
    "as the grains grow larger , they sink towards the disk mid - plane ; both the grain growth and sedimentation deplete the amount of small dust grains in the disk surface layers .",
    "this reduces the opacity offered by the disk surface layers to the stellar radiation and as a result the amount of energy absorbed by the surface layers decreases .",
    "consequently , the degree of flaring of the disk decreases , making the disks flatter : higher the degree of sedimentation , flatter are the disks @xcite .",
    "the changes in the disk geometry is readily reflected in the mid - ir seds .",
    "self - consistent accretion disks models , which incorporate the effects of dust settling , show that the shape of the mid - ir continuum is a good measure of the degree of dust settling @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sed slope between 13 and 31 @xmath0 has been used to characterize the vertical distribution of the dust in the disks @xcite .    a careful comparison of the observed mid - ir continuum slope of young protoplanetary disks in taurus",
    ", cha i and ophiuchus with that predicted by the models shows that significant dust settling has occurred in @xmath36  myr old protoplanetary disks .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the surface layers of most of these disks is found to be lower by factors of 100 to 1000 compared to the standard ism value , indicating a high degree of sedimentation in these disks @xcite .",
    "further , the degree of sedimentation and the frequency of sedimented disks in the @xmath34  myr old taurus , the @xmath26  myr old cha i and the @xmath17  myr ophiuchus star forming regions are found to be similar @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the distribution of the continuum spectral slope evaluated between 13 and 31 @xmath0 from the _ spitzer _ irs spectra of the young stars in these three regions are compared .",
    "the range and frequency of the distribution of the observed n@xmath37 index in quite similar in all the three regions .",
    "this suggests that significant dust settling occurs in protoplanetary disks by @xmath17  myr .",
    "a comparative study of the median mid - ir seds of these three regions also confirms that overall , the vertical structure of the disks in these three regions are very similar @xcite .      the silicate emission features observed in the mid - ir spectra of young stars have been used to infer the dust properties in protoplanetary disks .",
    "silicate emission feature produced by the sub@xmath0-sized amorphous grains in the disks tend to be narrow and peaked .",
    "grain growth and crystallization makes the silicate emission profile broad and structured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "detailed analysis of the shape and strength of silicate features in the _ spitzer _ irs spectra of a large sample of class  ii objects in the taurus region , show evidence for significant grain growth and crystallization in those disks @xcite .",
    "more quantitative spectral decomposition modeling of the irs spectra shows a wide range in the degree of grain growth and crystallization in young disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general ,",
    "the degree of dust processing ( grain growth and crystallization ) is found to correlate well with the degree of dust sedimentation in disks : less sedimented disks show evidence for relatively less processed dust whereas flat and highly sedimented disks appear to have highly processed grains @xcite . however , no strong correlations have been found between various stellar parameters and the degree of dust processing @xcite .",
    "one of the important contribution of _ spitzer _ in the area of disk evolution has been the identification and characterization of a large number disks with significantly altered radial structures .",
    "such disks have been called ` transitional disks ' to suggest that they are possibly in an evolutionary stage in between that of an optically thick disk and an optically thin disk @xcite .",
    "their seds are characterized by a significant deficit of flux at wavelengths @xmath38",
    "@xmath0 compared to that of the optically thick , full disks , along with a sharply rising continuum and excess emission comparable to , or higher than , that of a typical class  ii disk at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths @xcite ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "detailed modeling of their seds shows that transitional disks have inner holes or gaps in the radial dust opacity distribution that are surrounded by an optically thick outer disk with a ` wall ' at its inner edge .",
    "emission from this ` wall ' , where the abrupt transition from the inner optically thin region to outer optically thick disk takes place , is responsible for the sharply rising continuum longward of 13  @xmath0 observed in these objects @xcite .",
    "several transitional disks have now been identified from _ spitzer _",
    "photometric and spectroscopic surveys of nearby young clusters @xcite .",
    "most transitional disks are classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) meaning that they are active accretors ; however , their accretion rates are slightly lower than the median accretion rate of other class  ii disks in the region @xcite .",
    "the presence of holes and gaps in transitional disks , inferred from their observed seds , suggests that significant disk evolution has occurred in these disks .",
    "various disk evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of inner holes / gaps in transitional disks : substantial grain growth , planet formation , photoevaporation and mri - induced inner disk clearing are some of them @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the jovian mass planets opening up gaps and holes in the disks can explain most of the observed characteristics of a large sample of transitional disks @xcite .",
    "in close binary systems ( few au separation ) stellar companions can clear inner holes in the circumbinary disks @xcite ; the observed seds of such systems would appear transitional - disk - like , as has been demonstrated in the case of coku tau/4 @xcite .",
    "however , as argued by @xcite , not all close binaries show evidence for significant inner holes .",
    "objects which show these sed characteristics are likely to be in transition .",
    "the large photometric and spectroscopic surveys with _ spitzer _ have also identified another class of disks whose excess emission is significantly lower than that of the class  ii median for that region .",
    "these disks differ from the transitional disks discussed above in that their excess flux , even at longer wavelengths , is considerably lower than that of the class  ii median .",
    "also , they do not have a rising continuum longward of 13  @xmath0 indicating that the outer disk probably is not as optically thick as that of class  ii disks and the ` wall ' emission is not significant .",
    "this class of disks has been identified by various names in the literature : ` evolved disks ' , ` anemic disks ' , ` homologously depleted disks ' @xcite .",
    "the sed of an evolved disk is compared to that of a ` transitional disk ' in figure 4 .",
    "another crucial difference between classical transitional disks which have inner holes / gaps and the evolved disks is that the most evolved disks are weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) .",
    "they have stopped accreting or are accreting at very low rates @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if evolved disks fit into an evolutionary sequence in which the optically thick disk develops inner gaps and holes and eventually dissipates inside out .",
    "it is possible that they represent a different evolutionary path for the primordial optically thick disks where the disk dissipation does not proceed inside out . in this sense , evolved disks have also been taken to be in a transitional phase between a primordial optically thick disks and optically thin debris disks @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear what mechanisms can dissipate primordial disks simultaneously at all radii .",
    "ground based surveys which used the near - ir excess and emission lines diagnostics to probe the innermost parts ( @xmath39  au ) of the disks have shown that the median lifetime of accretion disks around young stars is only a few myr @xcite . _",
    "spitzer _ observations in the mid - ir , which probe the planet forming regions in the disk ( @xmath40  au ) , have confirmed this .",
    "spitzer _ studies of disk fraction in clusters show that most disks dissipate in about @xmath41  myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a small fraction of disks appear to last longer : the well known examples of long - lived accretion disks include members of @xmath42  cha  ( 6  myr ) , tw  hya  ( 8  myr ) and 25  ori  ( 8  myr ) groups , pds 66 ( @xmath43  myr ) and st  h@xmath44  34  ( @xmath45  myr ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "disk dissipation timescale is also found to depend on the central stellar mass : disk lifetimes are shorter for intermediate mass ( spectral type late b to f ) stars @xcite and marginally longer for brown dwarfs compared to that for solar - mass ( spectral type k to early m ) stars @xcite .    the observed low frequency ( @xmath40% ) of transitional disks in young clusters ,",
    "has long been taken as evidence for a relatively short - lived ( less than a few hundred thousand year ) transitional phase , during which an optically thick disk turns into an optically thin disk @xcite .",
    "the primordial disks last for a few myr , but disk dissipation , once initiated , occurs rapidly , on timescales @xmath39  myr .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the ` two - timescale ' behavior of disk dissipation @xcite .",
    "spitzer _ studies have significantly improved the statistics of well characterized transitional disks in nearby young clusters .",
    "some studies have reported a relatively high fraction ( @xmath46% ) of transitional and evolved disks in a few young clusters @xcite . based on this , it has been argued that the lifetimes of transitional disks are comparable to that of primordial disks and that the disk dissipation is not as rapid as previously thought @xcite .",
    "however , in some of these studies , flat well - settled disks and primordial disks around late m type stars have been misidentified as transitional or evolved disks , thereby increasing their apparent frequency ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the frequency of transitional and evolved disks has also been found to have an age dependence : a few percent at @xmath36  myr rising to @xmath47% at @xmath48  myr @xcite . while this trend may be real , the higher frequency of disks in transition in older clusters",
    "may not necessarily imply a longer transition timescale .",
    "it is more likely that star formation has stopped in older ( @xmath49  myr ) clusters , and as a result , there is no steady supply of primordial disks , which shoots up the ratio of the number of transitional disks to primordial disks . when the different star formation histories of @xmath50  myr clusters are properly taken into account , the transitional phase appear to last only for about @xmath51% of the median primordial disk lifetime ( @xmath52  myr ) @xcite .",

    "recent monte carlo simulations suggest that bulk of the cluster members are consistent within errors as having the same age with the exception of a few outliers @xcite .",
    "it appears that the observed dispersion in disk properties in a cluster can not be entirely due to the age spread .",

    "how else do we understand the observed dispersion in disk evolution in otherwise identical systems ? if all the disks started out the same - i.e.",

    "could it be that the disk dissipation and planet formation processes are stochastic in nature ?",
    "indeed , planet formation simulations show that disks with similar initial properties can result in very different final configurations @xcite .",
    "however , if the initial configurations of protoplanetary disks are different , they would look different at any instant of time , even if they all go through the same temporal evolutionary sequence .",
    "some of the self - consistent simulations of planet formation in protoplanetary disks show that the outcome of the process strongly depends on the initial conditions of the disks such as disk mass and the viscosity parameter @xmath44 , among others .",
    "disks with an initial mass of 0.1  m@xmath14 and low @xmath44 ( @xmath56 ) tend to form giant planets early , which migrate extensively and clear out the disks faster .",
    "on the other hand , low mass disks ( @xmath57  m@xmath14 ) with high @xmath44 ( @xmath21 ) are too slow to form planets and last longer @xcite . in this picture ,",

    "* ) , the controversial detection of a hot jupiter around tw  hya notwithstanding @xcite .",
    "thus , the later evolution and the appearance of a few myr old protoplanetary disks are affected and shaped by their initial conditions .",
    "it is quite possible that the observed dispersion in the properties of disks in a cluster is just a reflection of the dispersion in the initial properties of these disks .",
    "the initial conditions during the formation of protoplanetary disks is set by the star formation process .",
    "if episodic accretion is the norm during the embedded phase of the protostellar evolution , then the disks undergo a series of high accretion events .",
    "the frequency and magnitude of these events must clearly have an effect on the subsequent evolution and the observed properties of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the observed dispersion in the disk evolution could then partly be understood as the star formation process determining the initial disk configuration before the onset of planet formation .                                                              , n.  j. , dunham , m.  m. , jrgensen , j.  k. , enoch , m.  l. , mern , b. , van dishoeck , e.  f. , alcal , j.  m. , myers , p.  c. , stapelfeldt , k.  r. , huard , t.  l. , allen , l.  e. , harvey , p.  m. , van kempen , t. , blake , g.  a. , koerner , d.  w. , mundy , l.  g. , padgett , d.  l. , & sargent , a.  i. 2009 , , 181 , 321                    , l. , calvet , n. , watson , d.  m. , dalessio , p. , furlan , e. , sargent , b. , forrest , w.  j. , uchida , k.  i. , green , j.  d. , sloan , g.  c. , chen , c.  h. , najita , j. , kemper , f. , herter , t.  l. , morris , p. , barry , d.  j. , & hall , p. 2005",
