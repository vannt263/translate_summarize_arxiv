    "this work is a contribution to a large family of papers on light propagation in optically dressed media . in the seminal works of harris and co - workers",
    "@xcite it was shown that a medium , initially opaque for a resonant probe pulse , might become transparent due to an irradiation by a strong control field coupling the upper state with a long living side state in the so - called @xmath0 configuration .",
    "this process , called electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and described in terms of a transparency window in the medium s electric susceptibility , has become a basis for numerous studies consisting in its generalizations in various aspects ( for reviews see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular additional active states and coupling fields have been added or the paradigm of a single probe field has been generalized to admit a few coupled probe pulses or control fields . if one additionally allows the control fields to vary in time by changing their amplitudes or phases one obtains a means to control the propagation of the probe pulse or pulses .",
    "a spectacular example is a slowdown of the probe pulse due to an adiabatic decrease of the amplitude of the control field .",
    "switching the latter field off results in mapping the probe pulse into a coherent excitation of the medium , which is called light storage ; switching the control field on again leads to a transformation of this excitation back into the probe pulse which is in fact a pulse release with the phase relations being conserved @xcite .",
    "a qualitatively new situation occurs if the above - mentioned additional level and coupling scheme constitutes a closed interaction contour ( loop ) or even more loops @xcite . in such systems new fields",
    "can be generated , the details of the propagation become dependent on the overall phase of the fields and in general steady - state conditions can not be attained even if all the fields have time - independent envelopes . within the paradigm of weak probe and",
    "given control fields one can not describe the propagation in terms of a single electric susceptibility and the description of the probe field propagation requires an analysis in terms of coupled channels and a kind of `` normal modes '' . if additionally a strong control field couples the ground state with another state , the populations of atomic states may significantly change which may lead to light generation on the same transition in which the probe field acts .    in all the above - mentioned studies the couplings due to both probe and control fields were resonant or nearly resonant while the manipulations with the phases can lead to off - resonant couplings which can obviously affect eit .",
    "the case of a rapid variation of an optical phase on eit and the following essential changes in the medium absorption were investigated by abi - salloum _ et al .",
    "this effect was demonstrated experimentally by sautenkov _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the case of a @xmath0 configuration in which the control field has a periodically varying phase ( chirp ) . in other words , using an expansion of the phase factor into the fourier series , one can say that a probe field propagates in the medium which is dressed by a manifold of control fields with the frequencies differing by the chirp frequency and constituting an infinite number of coupled elementary loops .",
    "the resonance for the control field occurs thus during a certain fraction of the modulation period or in other words only for a part of the control field photons .",
    "this problem was first studied in the work of kiffner and dey @xcite .",
    "the authors demonstrated that a medium dressed by a chirped control field might in some situations exhibit transparency .",
    "they analyzed the problem both numerically and using a simplified model in the case of a small modulation frequency .",
    "their interpretation was based on the concept of a transparency window which oscillated in time .",
    "two particular examples were demonstrated : ( 1 ) a continuous probe field which became modulated ( chopped ) due to the transparency occurring only during a fraction of the control field modulation period and ( 2 ) a nonresonant gaussian pulse which could be transmitted in the situation of a proper timing , i.e. when it arrived just at the time when the window s position suited the pulse s detuning . however , as those authors have noticed , such an analysis fails for larger modulation frequencies . in particular the modulation of the continuous probe field becomes then more rapid and shallow and disappear when the frequency increases .",
    "in the present paper we consider the case of a medium dressed by a chirped control field of an arbitrary , in particular large , frequency of the phase modulation .",
    "we apply the same approach which was presented in our recent paper on probe pulse propagation in a medium dressed by three control fields constituting a loop @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we write the set of the maxwell - bloch equations with the probe field treated perturbationally .",
    "next we apply a kind of the floquet expansion and present the method of solution . in the following section we give approximate analytical solutions , obtained in the spirit of early papers on eit and light storage , namely assuming an adiabatic and absorptionless pulse propagation . those analytical formulas for the pulse spectrum together with a discussion of their applicability allow for an interpretation of numerical results presented in the last section .",
    "we examine how and in which conditions the idea of eit can be generalized in the case of chirped control pulses .",
    "in particular we find an optimal probe pulse ( i.e. such with a suitably chosen chirp ) for which transparency occurs and for a pulse which is not optimal we show that its part which is transmitted can be expressed in terms of its projection onto the optimal pulse .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper . in particular the atomic unit of time",
    "equals @xmath1 s , the atomic unit of length is @xmath2 m and the atomic unit of frequency is @xmath3 mhz .",
    "the object of our interest is a one - dimensional medium of atoms irradiated by two laser beams in the @xmath0 configuration : a probe pulse 1 couples the ground state @xmath4 with an excited state @xmath5 while a strong control field 2 couples the state @xmath5 with a long - living side state @xmath6 .",
    "a novel element is that we assume the control field to have a constant amplitude but a chirped , periodically varying phase ; this is equivalent to saying the the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are coupled by an infinite number of fields of frequencies differing by a multiple of the chirp frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one can view this coupling scheme as a ground state being coupled by a weak field @xmath7 with an infinite number of coupled loops .",
    "level and coupling scheme for the considered model .",
    "multiple arrows symbolize the coupling of the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 by a periodically chirped pulse , or , alternatively , by a manifold of pulses of frequencies differing by the chirp frequency . ]    because of the probe field being weak the ground state remains fully occupied . for the matrix elements of the atomic density matrix which are nonzero in the first order with respect to the probe field we obtain the following bloch equations @xmath8 in eq.(1 )",
    "@xmath9 is the atomic density matrix after the oscillations with the optical frequencies have been transformed off , @xmath10 is the position of the atom inside the one - dimensional sample , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the rabi frequencies of the probe and control fields , respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the detunings of the two fields , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are phenomenological relaxation rates for the two coherences , @xmath17 is a periodic phase ( chirp ) .",
    "the above bloch equations are completed by the maxwell equation for the probe field which takes the following form in the slowly - varying amplitude approximation @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the atomic density , @xmath21 - the matrix element of the dipole moment and @xmath22 the vacuum electric permittivity .",

    "we pass to the fourier picture and treat the functions the arguments of which differ by multiples of @xmath24 as independent variables ; this is in fact the floquet approach .",
    "we do not impose any restrictions on the value of the modulation frequency @xmath24 . in the fourier picture",
    "the bloch - maxwell equations take the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier variable .",

    "the truncation can be controlled using the fact that the absolute values of the bessel functions @xmath37 become small if the number @xmath38 is significantly larger than the argument @xmath39 .",

    "this gives account of a sequence of absorption and emission processes of virtual photons of frequency @xmath50 for various values of @xmath38 , treated in a nonperturbative way .",
    "in this subsection we present approximate solutions of the maxwell - bloch equations . they are obtained by generalizing the approach which led to an interpretation of eit and explaining light storage @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this approach will allow one to predict the medium s transparency for a chirped pulse in the case in which the chirp is appropriately chosen while the envelope fits the transparency window corresponding to an unchirped pulse .    in the adiabatic ( @xmath51 )",
