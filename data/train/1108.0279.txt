    "recent interest and progress in the theory of spin - orbital superexchange models was triggered by the observation that orbital degeneracy drastically increases quantum fluctuations which may suppress long - range order in the regime of strong competition between different types of ordered states near the quantum critical point.@xcite the simplest model of this type is the kugel - khomskii ( @xmath15 ) model introduced long ago@xcite for kcuf@xmath12 , a strongly correlated system with a single hole within degenerate @xmath1 orbitals at each cu@xmath16 ion .",
    "kugel and khomskii showed that many - body effects could then give rise to orbital order stabilized by a purely electronic superexchange mechanism .",
    "a similar situation occurs in a number of compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom , where strong on - site coulomb interactions localize electrons ( or holes ) and give rise to spin - orbital superexchange .",
    "@xcite the orbital superexchange may stabilize the orbital order by itself , but in @xmath1 systems it is usually helped by the orbital interactions which follow from the jahn - teller distortions of the lattice.@xcite for instance , in lamno@xmath12 these contributions are of equal importance and both of them are necessary to explain the observed high temperature of the structural transition.@xcite also in kcuf@xmath12 the lattice distortions play an important role and explain its strongly anisotropic magnetic and optical properties .",
    "@xcite    an important feature of spin - orbital superexchange , which arises in transition metal oxides with active orbital degrees of freedom , @xcite is generic frustration of the orbital part of the superexchange .",
    "it follows from the directional nature of orbital interactions,@xcite which is in contrast to the su(2 ) symmetry of spin interactions .",
    "therefore , the orbital part of the spin - orbital superexchange is intrinsically frustrated also on lattices without geometrical frustration , such as the three - dimensional ( 3d ) perovskite lattice of kcuf@xmath12 or lamno@xmath12 .",
    "generic features of this direction - dependent orbital interactions are best captured within the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum compass model , @xcite which exhibits a quantum phase transition from one to the other one - dimensional ( 1d ) columnar order through a point with isotropic and strongly frustrated interactions.@xcite in spite of the intrinsic frustration and high degeneracy of the ground state , the long - range order of 1d type exists in the 2d quantum compass model , as shown by a rigorous proof.@xcite numerical simulations demonstrate that this model is in the universality class of the 2d ising model@xcite and the order persists in a range of finite temperature.@xcite in contrast , the superexchange interactions for the 2d @xmath1 orbital model contain orbital quantum fluctuations on the bonds,@xcite but nevertheless the long - range order survives also in this case.@xcite    an intriguing situation arises when spin and orbital part of the superexchange are strongly coupled and compete with each other , as found in realistic spin - orbital models for several transition metal oxides.@xcite for instance , a qualitatively new spin - orbital liquid phase may arise when the superexchange interactions are geometrically frustrated on the triangular lattice,@xcite or spin order can not stabilize in linio@xmath13 , another compound with triangular lattice of magnetic , in spite of presence of strong orbital interactions which suggest pronounced orbital order.@xcite a more standard situation is found in the transition metal oxides which crystallize in the perovskite lattice , where in general spin order coexists with orbital order , @xcite and both satisfy the classical goodenough - kanamori rules.@xcite a well known example is the archetypical compound with degenerate @xmath1 orbitals , kcuf@xmath12 , in which the orbital order is stabilized jointly by the superexchange and jahn - teller lattice distortions.@xcite as a result , the magnetic interactions are strongly anisotropic and give rise to quasi-1d heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( af ) chain dominated by quantum fluctuations and characterized by spinon excitations , @xcite with a dimensional crossover occurring when temperature is lowered below the nel temperature @xmath17.@xcite    while the coexisting @xmath6-type af ( @xmath6-af ) order and the orbital order is well established in kcuf@xmath12 below @xmath17,@xcite and this phase is reproduced by the spin - orbital @xmath15 superexchange model,@xcite the model poses an interesting question by itself : which types of coexisting spin and orbital order ( or disorder ) are possible when its microscopic parameters are varied ?",
    "so far , it was only established that the long - range af order is destroyed by strong quantum fluctuations,@xcite and it has been shown that instead certain spin disordered phases with valence - bond ( vb ) correlations stabilized by local orbital correlations are favored .",
    "@xcite however , the phase diagram of the kugel - khomskii @xmath15 model is unknown  it was not studied systematically beyond the mean - field ( mf ) approximation and certain simple variational wave functions and it remains an outstanding problem in the theory.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to analyze a simpler situation of the spin - orbital kugel - khomskii model for a bilayer , called below bilayer spin - orbital @xmath15 model , consisting of two @xmath7 layers connected by interlayer bonds along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "this choice is motivated by an expected competition of the long - range af order with vb - like states .",
    "one of them , a vb phase with spin singlets on the interlayer bonds ( vb@xmath9 phase ) , is stabilized by large crystal field @xmath2 which favors occupied @xmath8 orbitals ( by holes ) .",
    "we shall investigate the range of stability of this and other phases , including the @xmath6-af phase similar to the one found in kcuf@xmath12 .",
    "to establish reliable results concerning short - range order in the crossover regime between phases with long - range af or fm order , we developed a _",
    "cluster mf approach _ which goes beyond the single site mf in the spin - orbital system@xcite and is based on an exact diagonalization of an eight - site cubic cluster coupled to its neighbors by mf terms .",
    "this unit is sufficient for investigating both af phases with four sublattices and vb states , with spin singlets either along the @xmath18 axis or within the @xmath7 planes .",
    "this theoretical method is motivated by possible spin - orbital entanglement@xcite which is particularly pronounced in the 1d su(4 ) [ or su(2)@xmath19su(2 ) ] spin - orbital models,@xcite and occurs also in the models for perovskites with af spin correlations on the bonds where it violates the goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "@xcite in the perovskite vanadates such entangled states play an important role in their optical properties,@xcite in the phase diagram@xcite and in the dimerization of fm interactions along the @xmath18 axis in the @xmath20-af phase of yvo@xmath12.@xcite below we shall investigate whether entangled states could play a role in the present kugel - khomskii model for a bilayer with nearly degenerate @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "thereby we establish exotic type of spin - orbital order stabilized by joint quantum spin - orbital fluctuations , and investigate signatures of entangled states in this phase .",

    "quantum fluctuations dominate at @xmath150 and for @xmath55 , where they stabilize either in - plane or interplanar spin singlets accompanied by directional orbitals which stabilize them .",
    "these two phases are reminiscent of the resonating valence - bond ( rvb ) phase and pvb phase found in the 3d spin - orbital @xmath15 model.@xcite here , however , the vb@xmath9 phase extends down to large values of @xmath2 , where instead the long - range order in the @xmath5-af@xmath9 phase was found in the 3d model .",
    "this demonstrates that interlayer quantum fluctuations are particularly strong in the present bilayer case . on the contrary , at @xmath54",
    "one finds the @xmath5-af spin order which coexists with fo order of @xmath39 orbitals .",
    "it is clear that both the vb@xmath9 and @xmath5-af phase are favored by the interplay of lattice geometry and by the shape of occupied orbitals for @xmath211 . in this low-@xmath83 regime of the diagram",
    "the area occupied by the pvb phase is narrow and especially orbital order is affected by the quantum critical fluctuations .",
    "the planar singlets are formed shortly after leaving the vb@xmath9 phase and remain stable afterwards .",
    "spin - orbital non - factorizability seems to be marginal in the entire vb@xmath9 phase but plays certain role when switching to the planar singlet phase , especially visible for the interplane bond covariance @xmath337 .    on the contrary , in the pvb phase away from the critical regime spin - orbital non - factorizability vanishes and",
    "suddenly reappears in the @xmath5-af phase , not as a transition effect but rather as a robust feature vanishing only for high values of @xmath2 .",
    "we argue that this is related with surprisingly rigid interplane spin - spin correlations which should , if we think in spin - orbital factorizable way , decay quickly as @xmath138 approaches @xmath113 . following this `` factorizable reasoning",
    "'' we could also expect stability of the @xmath20-af phase for higher values of @xmath83 , above the @xmath5-af phase .",
    "these effects are absent in our results , showing that intuition suggesting spin - orbital factorization can be misleading even when considering such a simple isotropic orbital configuration .    for higher values of hund s exchange @xmath83 frustration increases when af exchange interactions compete with fm ones , and as a result the most exotic phases with explicit on - site spin - orbital entanglement arise ; two of them , the eso and epvb phase are neighboring and placed in between the vb@xmath9 and pvb ones , and they become degenerate with both of them at the multicritical point where four phases meet ( see fig .",
    "[ diag ] ) .",
    "this situation follows from the fact that singlet phases are more susceptible to ferromagnetism favored by high @xmath83 than the @xmath5-af phase is , which turned out to be surprisingly robust . the eso phase is also a singlet phase similar to the vb@xmath9 one but with spin singlets and orbital order",
    "gradually suppressed under increasing hund s exchange @xmath83 . at the same time",
    "spin - orbital order stays almost constant and spin - orbital entanglement grows .",
    "further increase of @xmath83 always leads to the @xmath6-af phase throughout a discontinuous transition accompanied by an abrupt drop of spin - orbital entanglement . above @xmath353 the eso phase",
    "is completely immersed in the @xmath6-af one and ends up with a single bicritical point .",
    "if we come back below @xmath354 then the eso changes smoothly into the epvb phase , being an entangled precursor of the pvb order , meaning that the non - uniform orbital order and in - plane singlets are formed and spin - orbital entanglement drops . on the other hand , this phase can be also seen as an extension of the @xmath6-af into fully af sector because the epvb phase has long - range magnetic order , being however strongly non - uniform ( see fig .",
    "[ c3 ] ) .    finally , we would like to remark that experimental phase diagrams of strongly correlated transition metal oxides are one of the challenging directions of recent research .",
    "systematic trends observed for the onset of the magnetic and orbital order in the @xmath355vo@xmath12 perovskites have been successfully explained by the competing interactions in presence of spin - orbital entanglement.@xcite in contrast , the theory could not explain exceptionally detailed information on the phase diagram of the @xmath355mno@xmath12 manganites which accumulated due to impressive experimental work.@xcite the present k@xmath12cu@xmath13f@xmath14 bilayer system is somewhat similar to la@xmath356sr@xmath357mn@xmath13o@xmath14 bilayer manganites with very rich phase diagrams and competition between phases with different types of long - range order in doped systems.@xcite such phases are generic in transition metal oxides and were also reproduced in models of bilayer manganites which have to include in addition superexchange interaction between core @xmath358 spins@xcite that suppresses spin - orbital fluctuations and entanglement in the @xmath1 subsystem .",
    "in contrast , k@xmath12cu@xmath13f@xmath14 bilayer is rather unique as the only electronic interactions arise here due to entangled spin - orbital superexchange .",
    "they explain the origin of the vb@xmath9 phase observed@xcite in k@xmath12cu@xmath13f@xmath14 but not found in bilayer manganites , and provide a unique opportunity of investigating whether signatures of spin - orbital entanglement could be identified in future experiments .",
    "summarizing , the presented analysis demonstrates that spin - orbital entanglement plays a crucial role in complete understanding of the phase diagram of the bilayer spin - orbital @xmath15 model . by introducing additional spin - orbital order parameter independent of spin and orbital mean fields we obtained phases with spin disorder in highly frustrated regime of parameters",
    "the example of the entangled eso and epvb phases shows that joint spin - orbital order can be at least as strong as the other two ( spin or orbital ) types of order , or may even persist as the only symmetry breaking field when the remaining ones vanish .",
    "we argue that the cluster method we used here is sufficiently realistic to investigate the phase diagram of the 3d spin - orbital @xmath15 model , and could be applied to other spin - orbital superexchange models adequate for undoped transition metal oxides .",
