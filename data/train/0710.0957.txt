    "the miniaturisation of silicon devices has delivered exponentially growing performance for the past fifty years but quantum limits are now being reached",
    "as transistor gate lengths approach 5 nm . spintronics , which exploits the electron spin rather than the charge , will operate on a sub 1 nm length scale and thus facilitate another generation of devices .",
    "the achievement of many of the promises of spintronics depends on the ready availability of a material that is a semiconductor , ferromagnetic at room temperature , and with a highly tunable band gap and magnetic coupling .",
    "the controlled synthesis of a robust room temperature , ferromagnetic semiconductor on a nanoscale has yet to be achieved .",
    "recent reports of high temperature ferromagnetism in metal - free carbon materials have generated a great deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "proton - bombardment of graphite  @xcite gives rise to a ferromagnetic phase which x - ray circular dichroism measurements  @xcite have shown to originate from carbon @xmath1 electrons .",
    "pyrolytic treatment of organic compounds  @xcite also gives rise to a ferromagnetic matetieal . in both cases",
    ", the magnetic phase appears to be a minority phase in a non - magnetic host .",
    "the detailed composition and structure of the minority phase have not yet been determined but the concentrations of magnetic impurities have been measured sufficiently accurately to suggest that the magnetism is not the result of contamination@xcite .    the occurrence of high temperature ferromagnetism in purely sp - bonded materials is a major challenge to current theoretical understanding of magnetic interaction mechanisms . a chemical or structural defect in a carbon - based material leads to the creation of local magnetic moments due to the presence of under- or over - coordinated atoms .",
    "the presence of local moments needs to be accompanied by strong long - range coupling between them for the ferromagnetic order to survive thermal fluctuations at room temperature . in extended graphene sheets , local moment formation at point defects",
    "is now well established  @xcite . a significant step forward in the study of the magnetic coupling between local defects has been the demonstration that the presence of spin moments at the edges of graphene ribbons can lead to an instability of the @xmath0-electron system , providing a mechanism for long range antiferromagnetic coupling which is robust with respect to competing instabilities involving charge ordering and geometric distortions  @xcite .",
    "more recently , yazyev and helm  @xcite have studied defective graphene using density functional theory .",
    "they find a ferromagnetic ground state which they assume to be of the itinerant type due to the metallicity of their system .",

    "@xcite studied the interaction between localised moments originating from lattice defects at large distances and concluded that the transition temperature to the ferromagnetic rkky state is far below room temperature .",

    "a possibile source of high temperature ferromagnetism in carbon systems has been ascribed by edwards _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to a limited screening of the interactions between itinerant electrons in impurity sp - bands .",
    "the expected suppression of the stoner critical temperature ( typical in the case of transition metal impurity d - bands ) is considerably reduced due to a less effective screening of the electron interaction . in the present case",
    "we show a completely different scenario , i.e. that high temperature ferromagnetism in a carbon system can be entirely supported by an insulating state of the electronic structure .",
    "the current work demonstrates that local spin moments in defective graphene interact strongly over long distances and may therefore lead to a ferromagnetic semiconducting state at room temperature .",
    "the strong , long - range magnetic coupling necessary for magnetic ordering at room temperature in this semiconducting material is provided via a spin alternation mechanism that depends on the presence of partially filled @xmath0 orbitals in the sp@xmath2-bonded , bipartite lattice of graphene .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the spin - dependent band gap and magnetic coupling strength can be varied through control of the defect concentration , opening up the possibility of highly tunable graphene - based spintronics nanodevices .",
    "this study , therefore , reinforces the case , which has been growing stronger and stronger since the ground - breaking practical realisation of isolated graphene sheets  @xcite , for considering graphene amongst the most promising materials for building the electronic and spintronic devices of the future .",
    "spin localisation at defects and long range spin coupling are studied here using all electron , two - dimensionally periodic , hybrid exchange density functional theory ( b3lyp  @xcite ) which significantly extends the reliability of the widely used local and gradient corrected approximations to density functional theory in strongly interacting systems@xcite . in the crystal package , used for this study , the crystalline wavefunctions are expanded as a linear combination of atom centred gaussian orbitals ( lcao ) with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the calculations reported here are all - electron , i.e. , with no shape approximation to the ionic potential or electron charge density",
    ". basis sets of double valence quality ( 6 - 21g@xmath7 for c and 6 - 31g@xmath7 for h ) are used .",
    "a reciprocal space sampling on a monkhorst - pack grid of shrinking factor equal to 6 is adopted after finding it to be sufficient to converge the total energy to within @xmath8 ev per unit cell .    in the present work we consider three types of structure , characterised by different arrangements of defects .",
    "the first structure contains defects arranged in pairs within a rectangular unit cell that is 25   wide and of length 2@xmath9 , which is convenient for studying inter - defect coupling .",
    "the system under study is therefore infinitely periodic in the 2 dimensions parallel to the graphene plane and non - periodic in the direction perpendicular to the plane . in fig .",
    "3 the unit cell containing a pair of defects is shown .",
    "the defects are therefore arranged along parallel chains running along the horizontal direction and the chains are 25   apart .",
    "the second structure is an hexagonal cell used to quantify inter - chain effects .",
    "the third structure is a triangular superlattice used for representing the band structure in a form compatible with that of graphene ( fig .",
    "all structures considered were initially relaxed using a force - field model ( gulp  @xcite ) in which the carbon - carbon and carbon - hydrogen interactions are described via the brenner bond order potential  @xcite . in the case of the calculation of the stabilisation energy @xmath10e ( see below and fig .",
    "2 ) , full quantum mechanical relaxation was carried out for the structure with l=7.5  ( see below ) and resulted in a small increase in @xmath10e ( see fig .",
    "2 ) of 25 mev . as the additional relaxation",
    "is confined to the region of the defect , the energy shift is expected to be depend weakly on the defect separation especially at large distances and thus full quantum mechanical relaxation was not required for larger structures .",
    "the magnetic stablisation energy reported in fig . 2 , and the transition temperature based on it , is therefore slightly underestimated . in the analysis of the electronic band structure shown in fig .",
    "4 , where defects are displayed in a triangular lattice and are 20   apart , we performed a full quantum - mechanical optimisation in order to quantify the magnitude and decay law of the semiconducting gap .",
    "a number of point defects are possible . here",
    "we choose to study a simple carbon vacancy in which two of the three dangling carbon bonds are saturated with h - atoms .",
    "this defect has been proposed previously , studied extensively  @xcite , and is displayed in fig . 1 .        within a valence bond picture",
    "there are two unpaired electrons in the defect as the breaking of three @xmath0-bonds generates 1/3 of an unpaired electron on each of the c - atoms neighbouring the vacancy and the breaking of the @xmath11-bond also generates an unpaired electron .",
    "hund s rule coupling within the uncoordinated c - atom and the spin - alternation rule operating between the @xmath0-electrons ensures that these spins are aligned and thus the overall magnetic moment on the defect is 2@xmath12 ( @xmath12 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same defect is due to a higher degree of electron localisation induced by a hybrid functional . ] in the current study this defect is used as an example of the many possible structures at which electron localisation might occur in a graphene sheet .",
    "the conclusions drawn below depend on the arrangement of defects and on their ability to generate a local magnetic moment through an instability of the electronic system , but are not expected to depend on the structural and chemical details of the defects .",
    "e on the distance between defects @xmath9 . ]",
    "the interaction of the localised moments is quantified by computing the quantity @xmath13 ( stabilization energy ) which is defined as the difference between the total electronic energy of the antialigned and aligned arrangements of the defects spins .",
    "the decay of the stablisation energy with @xmath9 is approximately @xmath14 mev and it is shown in fig .",
    "the calculated coupling energy can be related to the curie temperature ( @xmath15 ) , at which the ferromagnetic order is lost due to thermal fluctuations , through an effective heisenberg model with an interaction @xmath16 per pair of spins . according to the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite ,",
    "a two dimensional isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet is unstable with respect to thermal fluctuations at any finite temperature and therefore does not support long range order .",
    "however such effects are seen to reduce significantly when a small coupling along the third direction is introduced .",
    "recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) studies on quasi two dimensional heisenberg ferromagnets  @xcite have shown that the introduction of an interlayer coupling 0.1% of that in - plane is enough to restore a finite value of @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , for a square lattice of spin-@xmath17 @xmath18 ( see fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which , compared to a mean - field expression @xmath19 ( z is the coordinaton number ) , differs by a factor of about @xmath20 . on the right - hand side of the graph in fig",
    "2 , the transition temperature @xmath15 for a square lattice arrangement of defects within the qmc formula above is shown for different interdefects distances . for this arrangement of the defects ,",
    "the ferromagnetic state is lower in energy over the whole range of distances considered and is predicted to be stable at room temperature up to very large defect separations ( fig .",
    "the present system should be considered as a model system for the study of more complex and realistic cases such as defective graphite  @xcite or multilayer defective graphene or defective graphene on a substrate where a small but non zero exchange interaction in the third direction is usually found .",
    "the ferromagnetic long range order at room temperature is in agreement with recent experiments on bombarded graphite where a room temperature ferromagnetic ground state is found and the average inter - defect distance was determined to be about 1 nm  @xcite .",
    "effects due to interchain interaction expected at distances l close to the interchain fixed distance of 25   are seen not to change the picture qualitatively . to confirm this ,",
    "we independently considered a series of calculation of @xmath13 for a strictly 2-dimensional arrangement of defects ( a hexagonal superlattice of defects ) for which the qualitative nature of the long ranged interaction is unchanged and the power of the decay law is found to be 1.7 .",
    "the bipartite nature of the lattice and the presence of the partially filled @xmath0 system of electrons in the @xmath21 network of atoms are essential for establishing the strong , long - range coupling mechanism that gives magnetic ordering at high temperature .",
    "this mechanism is the result of local exchange repulsion , which ensures that the partially filled @xmath0 orbital of each carbon atom is coupled in an anti - parallel fashion to that on its nearest neighbour . the operation of this mechanism to produce a long range spin polarisation within the sheet is evident in the spin density displayed in fig .",

    " ) and blue ( at -0.021 @xmath22 ) ) isosurfaces represent the majority and minority spin densities , respectively .",
    "the majority spin density within the defect is concentrated on the unsaturated carbon atoms and their second neighbours .",
    "the operation of the spin alternation rule in the spin polarised lattice is clearly visible . ]",
    "it is notable that this mechanism extends the validity of lieb s theorem beyond a nearest neighbour model  @xcite .",
    "the predicted ferromagnetic nature of the overall interaction is also entirely consistent with previous studies of interactions between extended defects in graphene ribbons  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the spin alternation mechanism that the ferromagnetic coupling between the localised spin moments depends on the defects being arranged on the same sublattice of the graphene sheet .",
    "a regular arrangement on opposite sublattices would lead to antiferromagnetic coupling , as seen by yazyev _",
    "et al . _ at short separation  @xcite , and a random arrangement of defects would be expected to lead to a ground state of smaller spontaneous magnetisation , while retaining the strong local coupling .",
    "this prediction agrees with the current experimental observation by esquinazi _ et .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. high transition temperature and small total magnetisation ) , where the defect density is controlled , to an extent , via the defect implantation technique but the defects are most probably distributed randomly .",

    "the semiconducting properties of the electronic structure of the system considered in the present study , the electronic band structure is show in fig . 4 for the ferromagnetic state of a triangular array of defects at a separation of  20   .",
    "this choice of array facilitates the comparison with that electronic structure of perfect graphene .",
    "the previously analysed structures ( parallel chains and hexagonal arrangement of defects ) show the same qualitative features as for the triangular array .",
    "the presence of the defects and the magnetic ordering break the symmetry of the graphene @xmath0 system , opening band gaps of 0.51 and 0.55 ev in the majority and minority spin band structures , respectively .",
    "the energy gap of the majority states is shifted upwards by about 0.20 ev with respect to the energy gap of the minority states , and the shape of the bands around the fermi energy is markedly spin dependent .",
    "a strong spin asymmetry in the conductivity of the sheet is therefore to be expected .",
    "the size of the band gap is reduced to 0.1 ev when adopting the pbe generalised gradient approximation  @xcite .",
    "calculations at a variety of defect separations establish that the band gap scales as @xmath23 .",
    "this decay law is consistent with that recently calculated for graphene ribbons where the edges are line defects at which the spin moments localise and the band gap scales as @xmath24 with the ribbon width .    ) .",

    "recently yazyev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported gga calculations that produced ferromagnetism in graphene induced by the presence of defects but the magnetic coupling mechanism proposed differs strongly from that described in the current work . in ref .",
    "@xcite a metallic state is obtained and the ferromagnetic order is therefore assumed to be supported by itinerant electrons . in the present study",
    "the ground state is semiconducting and the magnetic coupling is clearly not due to itinerant electrons . for this reason we adopt an effective heisenberg model in order to assess the temperature related properties of the system rather than the stoner model of ref .",
    "@xcite . the explanation for this different behaviour does not reside in the morphology or in the concentration of defects nor in the treatment of electronic exchange and correlation ( the band gap is still present when using the gradient corrected functional pbe as adopted in ref .",
