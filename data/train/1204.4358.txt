    "to distinguish between the single ( sd ; accretion by a white dwarf ( wd ) from a late main sequence ( ms ) or red giant ( rg ) companion ) and double ( dd ; the spiral - in and merger of two wds due to gravitational wave radiation emission ) degenerate scenario for type ia supernova ( sn ia ) formation , we use an updated version of the population number synthesis ( pns ) code by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de donder & vanbeveren ( 2004 ) ) .",

    "( 2008 ) ) , including the mass stripping effect with its strength parameter @xmath0 which can lie between 0 ( turning the effect off ) and 10 . for the dd scenario ,",
    "it is either assumed that every wd merger exceeding 1.4 @xmath1 results in such an event , or that it is additionally required to be a merger of two c - o wds .",
    "obviously , these assumptions result in different absolute sn ia rates , however , the observed trends and thus the conclusions are not affected .",
    "a parameter study is undertaken , first and foremost concerning the fraction @xmath2 of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) material that is being accepted by the accretor star . if @xmath3 , indicating non - conservative rlof , it is assumed that the lost matter leaves the system through a circumbinary disk , therefore taking with it the specific angular momentum of @xmath4 .",
    "if a common envelope ( ce ) phase is encountered , it is treated with the @xmath5-formalism by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* webbink ( 1984 ) ) .",
    "there are two typical channels that can lead to a dd sn ia : a system can either evolve through a stable rlof followed by a ce phase ( typically resulting in a delay time of a few gyr ) or through two successive ce phases ( with a typical delay of only a few tens or hundreds of myr ) .",
    "it is important to remark however that the former channel only works if the rlof phase is assumed to be ( quasi-)conservative , otherwise systems will already merge during this phase and thus not result in a sn ia . as in most other pns studies , we find an absolute sn ia rate that lies too low compared to observations , in our case by a factor of 2 - 3 at 11 gyr .",
    "while this may be partially due to errors in the conversion factor between observational ( snuk ) and theoretical ( snum ) units ( see also the contribution by pritchet ) , we present a suggestion for a more physical solution to this problem .",
    "there are indications that stars born in binaries rotate faster on the zams than normal single stars .",
    "if this is so , they will also have heavier ms convective cores , which will ( even if the stars are synchronized later on ) result in heavier wd remnants and thus more wd mergers exceeding 1.4 @xmath1 .",

    "it is obvious that the sd dtd ( shown for @xmath7 ) drops away too fast and too soon in order to keep matching the observations at later times .",
    "the dd dtd is able to match the observations , but only in the case of @xmath8 .",
    "this implies not only that @xmath2 indeed needs to lie close to 1 , but also that those systems which no longer result in a sn ia if @xmath6 ( about 80% of the total ) have gone through such a quasi - conservative rlof phase , and not two successive ce phases .",
    "most of the sd events issue from the wd+ms channel , not wd+rg .",
    "the best match between the observed and predicted dtd is obtained when we assume that both the sd and dd channel contribute , the former with a slightly less high value ( @xmath9 ) for the mass stripping parameter than is standard .    a note on the differences in models obtained by different groups performing pns studies ( see also the contributions by toonen , nelemans and claeys ) .",
    "a comparison study is going on to look for the causes of differences in the predictions .",
    "it should finally result in an explanatory paper .",
    "the most important discrepancies are being caused by differences in assumptions , mainly about mass and angular momentum loss and the treatment of ce phases .",
    "homogenizing the assumptions as much as the codes technically allow results in converging models .",
    "some ( more minor ) discrepancies remain .",
    "this seems inevitable given the different treatment of the `` single star tracks '' , i.e. the stellar evolution of individual binary components .",
    "for example , the use of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hurley et al . ( 2002 ) ) prescription , versus using full binary evolution .",
    "a second distribution which allows to constrain sn ia progenitors is the g - dwarf metallicity distribution . because of their very long lifetime ,",
    "g - type dwarfs in the galactic disk are excellent indicators of the entire chemical history of this region .",
    "the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) distribution of these stars is critically affected by the sn ia rate throughout the galaxy s history , and thus also by the progenitor assumptions .",
    "the thus predicted distributions can be compared to observed distributions for a cylindrical solar neighborhood , in this case those by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* holmberg et al . ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "we use an updated version of the chemical evolution model used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de donder & vanbeveren ( 2004 ) ) for a similar study .",
    "other studies have been performed in the meantime by e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* greggio et al . ( 2008 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matteucci et al . ( 2009 ) ) ( both not with a full pns model but with various adopted dtds ) , as well as very recently by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kobayashi & nakasato ( 2011 ) ) ( for sd progenitors only ) .",
    "we use a binary fraction ( the fraction of stars with a stellar companion ) of 70% , which is required to be that large in order to yield sufficiently high sn ia rates . for the galaxy formation , we assume either the two - infall model or a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) .    in case of the sfr obtained from the two - infall model , and for contribution by both the sd ( with @xmath9 ) and dd channel , we find a metallicity distribution which peaks at approximately the right location , however it is far too much peaked to match the morphological shape of the observed one .",
    "figure 2 illustrates that it shows a slightly better resemblance to the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* holmberg et al . (",
    "2007 ) ) distribution for a spherical solar neighborhood as is used for comparison by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kobayashi & nakasato ( 2011 ) ) .",
    "however , since in our code a cylindrical model is used , we should indeed compare to such observations .",
    "the metallicity distribution which is found when a constant sfr ( with total star formation equal to the previous case ) is assumed , is shown in fig .",
    "3 . in addition to cylindrical model observations , this figure shows the histogram obtained with the combined sd ( with @xmath9 ) + dd model , as well as the models for only sd ( with @xmath7 ) and dd respectively .",
    "it shows that the combined model produces a very good match , while either scenario alone ( especially the sd , even with high @xmath0 ) is unable to produce sufficiently high metallicity .",
    "therefore , this study with its updated and internally pns - computed sn ia yields supports previous results favoring the sd + dd model .",
    "this combined model also satisfactorily reproduces the observed [ c / fe ] and [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations .",
    "we find that both the delay time ( see also ( * ? ?",
    "? * mennekens et al . ( 2010 ) ) ) and g - dwarf metallicity distribution point toward a significant contribution by both the single and double degenerate scenario , the latter mainly through systems that have undergone a quasi - conservative roche lobe overflow followed by a common envelope phase .",
    "the critical dependence of both distributions on certain binary evolutionary processes , exactly those processes which are described in population codes by still uncertain parameters , is a way to find out more about these processes and thus further constrain these parameters ."
