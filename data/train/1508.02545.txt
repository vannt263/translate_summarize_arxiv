    "( 2 ) in the erd case , at fixed non - zero zeeman field , @xmath0 increases relative to the case without spin - orbit coupling for all values of the binding energy .",
    "this is due to the emergence of a triplet component of the order parameter , induced by the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
