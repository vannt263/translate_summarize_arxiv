    "the purpose of this work is to develop a positivity - preserving version of the lax - wendroff discontinuous galerkin method for the compressible euler equations on unstructured meshes .",
    "the compressible euler equations form a system of hyperbolic conservation law that can be written as follows : @xmath0 the _ conserved _ variables are the mass density , @xmath1 , the momentum density , @xmath2 , and the energy density , @xmath3 ; the _ primitive _ variables are the mass density , @xmath1 , the fluid velocity , @xmath4 , and the pressure , @xmath5 . the energy @xmath3 is related to the primitive variables through the equation of state , @xmath6 where the constant @xmath7 is the ratio of specific heats ( aka , the _ gas constant _ ) .",
    "the compressible euler equations are an important mathematical model in the study of gases and plasma .",
    "attempts at numerically solving the these equations has led to a plethora of important historical advances in the development of numerical analysis and scientific computing ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the focus of this work is on high - order discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods , which were originally developed for general hyperbolic conservation laws by cockburn , shu , et al . in series of papers @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to set the notation used throughout the paper and to briefly describe the dg spatial discretization .",
    "let @xmath8 be a polygonal domain with boundary @xmath9 .",
    "the domain @xmath10 is discretized via a finite set of non - overlapping elements , @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the set of polynomials from @xmath14 to @xmath15 with maximal polynomial degree @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the _ broken _ finite element space on the mesh : @xmath18^{\\meq } : \\ ,      w^h \\bigl|_{{\\mathcal{t}}_i } \\in \\left [ { p}^{\\ , \\deg } \\right]^{\\meq } , \\ , \\forall { \\mathcal{t}}_i \\in { \\mathcal{t}}^h \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the mesh spacing .",
    "the above expression means that @xmath20 has @xmath21 components , each of which when restricted to some element @xmath11 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath16 and no continuity is assumed across element edges ( or faces in 3d ) .",
    "the approximate solution on each element @xmath11 at time @xmath22 is of the form q^h(t^n , * x * ( ) ) |__i = _",
    "= 1^ ( ) q^ ( ) n_i ^ ( ) ( ) , where @xmath23 is the number of legendre polynomials and @xmath24 are the legendre polynomials defined on the reference element @xmath25 in terms of the reference coordinates @xmath26 .",
    "the legendre polynomials are orthonormal with respect to the following inner product : _ _ 0 ^(k ) ( ) ^ ( ) ( ) d=    1 & k= , + 0 & k .",
    "we note that independent of @xmath19 , @xmath27 , @xmath16 , and the type of element , the lowest order legendre polynomial is always @xmath28 .",
    "this makes the first legendre coefficient the cell average : q^(1 ) n_i = _ _ 0 q^h(t^n , * x * ( ) ) |__i ^(1 ) ( ) d= : ^n_i .",
    "the most common approach for time - advancing dg spatial discretizations is via explicit runge - kutta time - stepping ; the resulting combination of time and space discretization is often referred to as the `` rk - dg '' method @xcite .",
    "the primary advantage for this choice of time stepping is that explicit rk methods are easy to implement , they can be constructed to be low - storage , and a subclass of these methods have the so - called strong stability preserving ( ssp ) property @xcite , which is important for defining a scheme that is provably positivity - preserving . however , there are no explicit runge - kutta methods that are ssp for orders greater than four @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with runge - kutta methods is that they typically require many stages ; and therefore , many communications are needed per time step .",
    "one direct consequence of the communication required at each rk stage is that is difficult to combine rk - dg with locally adaptive mesh refinement strategies that simultaneously refine in both space and time .",
    "the key piece of technology required in locally adaptive dg schemes is local time - stepping ( see e.g. , dumbser et al .",
    "@xcite ) . local time - stepping is easier to accomplish with a single - stage , single - step ( lax - wendroff ) method than with a multi - stage runge - kutta scheme . for these reasons there",
    "is interest from discontinuous galerkin theorists and practitioners in developing single - step time - stepping techniques for dg ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as hybrid multistage multiderivative alternatives @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we construct a numerical scheme that uses a lax - wendroff time discretization that is coupled with the discontinuous galerkin spatial discretization . in subsequent discussions in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the advantages of switching to single - stage and single - stage time - stepping in regards to enforcing positivity on arbitrary meshes .      in simulations involving strong shocks , high - order schemes ( i.e. more than first - order ) for the compressible euler equations generally create nonphysical undershoots ( below zero ) in the density and/or pressure",
    ". these undershoots typically cause catastrophic numerical instabilities due to a loss of hyperbolicity .",
    "moreover , for many applications these positivity violations exist even when the equations are coupled with well - understood total variation diminishing ( tvd ) or total variation bounded ( tvb ) limiters .",
    "the chief goal of the limiting scheme developed in this work is to address positivity violations in density and pressure , and in particular , to accomplish this task with a high - order scheme .    in the dg literature ,",
    "the most widely used strategy to maintain positivity was developed by zhang and shu in a series of influential papers @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy of zhang and shu for a positivity - preserving rk - dg method can be summarized as follows :    * step 0 . * : :    write the current solution in the form    @xmath29 where @xmath30 is    yet - to - be - determined .",
    "@xmath31 represents the    unlimited solution .",
    "* step 1 . * : :    find the largest value of @xmath30 , where    @xmath32 , such that    @xmath33 satisfies the appropriate    positivity conditions at some appropriately chosen quadrature points    and limit the solution .",
    "* step 2 . * : :    find the largest stable time - step that guarantees that with a forward    euler time that the cell average of the new solution remains positive .",
    "* step 3 . *",
    ": :    rely on the fact that strong stability - preserving runge - kutta methods    are convex combinations of forward euler time steps ; and therefore ,    the full method preserves the positivity of cell averages ( under some    slightly modified maximum allowable time - step ) .    for a lax - wendroff time discretization ,",
    "numerical results indicate that the limiting found in step 1 is insufficient to retain positivity of the solution , even for simple 1d advection .",
    "therefore , the strategy we pursue in this work will still contain an equivalent step 1 ; however , in place of step 2 and step 3 above , we will make use of a parameterized flux , sometimes also called a flux corrected transport ( fct ) scheme , to maintain positive cell averages after taking a single time step . in doing so , we avoid introducing additional time step restrictions that often appear ( e.g. , in step 2 . above ) when constructing a positivity - preserving scheme based on runge - kutta time stepping .",
    "this idea of computing modified fluxes by combining a stable low - order flux with a less robust high - order flux is relatively old , and perhaps originates with harten and zwas and their _ self adjusting hybrid scheme _ @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is the foundation of the related _ flux corrected transport _ ( fct ) schemes of boris , book and collaborators @xcite , where fluxes are adjusted in order to guarantee that average values of the unknown are constrained to lie within locally defined upper and lower bounds .",
    "this family of methods is used in an extensive variety of applications , ranging from seismology to meteorology @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of some of the early methods is conducted in @xcite .",
    "identical to modern maximum principle preserving ( mpp ) schemes , fct can be formulated as a global optimization problem where a `` worst case '' scenario assumed in order to decouple the previously coupled degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "here we do not attempt to use fct to enforce any sort of local bounds ( in the sense of developing a shock - capturing limiter ) , instead we leverage these techniques in order to retain positivity of the density and pressure associated to @xmath34 ; such approaches have recently received renewed interest in the context of weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) methods @xcite .    to summarize , our limiting scheme draws on ideas from the two aforementioned families of techniques that are well established in the literature .",
    "first , we start with the now well known ( high - order ) pointwise limiting developed for discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite , and second , we couple this with the very large family of flux limiters @xcite .",
    "( developed primarily for finite - difference ( fd ) and finite - volume ( fv ) schemes ) .",
    "the compressible euler equations can be written compactly as @xmath35 where the _ conserved variables _ are @xmath36 and the _ flux function _ is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the basic positivity limiting strategy proposed in this work is summarized below .",
    "some important details are omitted here , but we elaborate on these details in subsequent sections .    *",
    "step 0 . * : :    on each element we write the solution as    @xmath40    where @xmath30 is yet - to - be - determined .",
    "@xmath41 represents the _ unlimited _ solution . *",
    "step 1 . * : :    assume that this solution is positive in the mean .",
    "that is , we assume    for all @xmath42 that @xmath43 and    @xmath44    a consequence of these assumptions is that    @xmath45 .",
    "* step 2 . * : :    find the largest value of @xmath30 , where    @xmath32 , such that the density and pressure    are positive at some suitably defined quadrature points .",
    "this step is    elaborated upon in  [ subsec : mpp - limiter ] .",
    "* step 3 . * : :    construct time - averaged fluxes through the lax - wendroff procedure .",
    "that is , we start with the exact definition of the time - average flux :    @xmath46    and approximate this via a taylor series expansion around    @xmath47 : @xmath48    all time derivatives in this expression are replaced by spatial    derivatives using the chain rule and the governing pde .",
    "the    approximate time - averaged flux is first evaluated at some    appropriately chosen set of quadrature points  in fact , the same    quadrature points as used in step 2  and then , using appropriate    quadrature weights , summed together to define a high - order flux , at    both interior and boundary quadrature points .",
    "thanks to step 2 , all    quantities of interest used to construct this expansion are positive    at each quadrature point .",
    "* step 4 . * : :    time step the solution so that cell averages are guaranteed to be    positive .",
    "that is , we update the _ cell averages _ via a formula of the    form    @xmath49 where    @xmath50 is an outward - pointing ( relative to    @xmath11 ) normal vector to edge @xmath51    with the property that @xmath52 is the length of    edge @xmath53 , and the numerical flux on    edge , @xmath54 , is a convex combination of a    high - order flux , @xmath55 , and a low - order flux    @xmath56 :    @xmath57 the low - order flux ,    @xmath58 , is based on the ( approximate )    solution to the riemann problem defined by cell averages only , and the    `` high - order '' flux , @xmath59 , is    constructed after integrating via gaussian quadrature the    ( approximate ) riemann solutions at quadrature points along the edge    @xmath60 :    @xmath61 where @xmath62    are the gaussian quadrature weights for quadrature with    @xmath63 points and    @xmath64 are the numerical fluxes at    each of the @xmath63 quadrature points .",
    "note that    this sum has only a single summand in the one - dimensional case .",
    "the    selection of @xmath30 is described in more detail in     [ subsec : mpp - limiter ] .",
    "this step guarantees that the solution retains    positivity ( in the mean ) for a single time step .",
    "* step 5 . * : :    apply a shock - capturing limiter .",
    "the positivity - preserving limiter is    designed to preserve positivity of the solution , but it fails at    reducing spurious oscillations , and therefore a shock - capturing    limiter needs to be added .",
    "there are many choices of limiters    available ; we use the limiter recently developed in @xcite because of    its ability to retain genuine high - order accuracy , and its ability to    push the polynomial order to arbitrary degree without modifying the    overall scheme .",
    "* step 6 . * : :    repeat all of these steps to update the solution for the next time    step .",
    "each step of this process is elaborated upon throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "the end result is that our method is the first scheme to simultaneously obtain all of the following properties :    * * high - order accuracy . *",
    "the proposed method is third - order in space and time , and can be extended to arbitrary order . *",
    "* positivity - preserving . *",
    "the proposed limiter is provably positivity - preserving for the density and pressure , at a finite set of point values , for the entire simulation . * * single - stage , single - step .",
    "* we use a lax - wendroff discretization for time stepping the pde , and therefore we only need one communication per time step . *",
    "* unstructured meshes . *",
    "because we use the discontinuous galerkin method for our spatial discretization and all of our limiters are sufficiently local , we are able to run simulations with dg - fem on both cartesian and unstructured meshes .",
    "* * no additional time - step restrictions .",
    "* because we do not rely on a ssp runge - kutta scheme , we do not have to introduce additional time - step restrictions to retain positivity of the solution .",
    "this differentiates us from popular positivity - preserving limiters based on rk time discretizations @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper has the following structure .",
    "the lax - wendroff dg ( lxw - dg ) method is described in  [ sec : lwdg ] , where we view the scheme as a method of modified fluxes .",
    "the positivity - preserving limiter is described in  [ sec : positivity ] , where the discussion of the limiter is broken up into two parts : ( 1 ) the moment limiter (  [ sec : zh - limiter ] ) and ( 2 ) the parameterized flux limiter (  [ subsec : mpp - limiter ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] we present numerical results on several test cases in 1d , 2d cartesian , and 2d unstructured meshes .",
    "finally we close with conclusions and a discussion of future work in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the lax - wendroff discontinuous galerkin ( lxw - dg ) method @xcite serves as the base scheme for the method developed in this work .",
    "it is the result of an application of the cauchy - kovalevskaya procedure to hyperbolic pde : we start with a taylor series in time , then we replace all time derivatives with spatial derivatives via the pde .",
    "finally , a galerkin projection discretizes the overall scheme , where a single spatial derivative is reserved for the fluxes in order to perform integration - by - parts .",
    "we review the lax - wendroff dg scheme for the case of a general nonlinear conservation law that is autonomous in space and time in multiple dimensions @xcite .",
    "the current presentation illustrates the fact that lax - wendroff schemes can be viewed as a method of modified fluxes , wherein higher - order information about the pde is directly incorporated by simply redefining the fluxes that would typically be used in an `` euler step . ''",
    "we consider a generic conservation law of the form @xmath65 where the matrix @xmath66 is diagonalizable for every unit length vector @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the domain of interest .",
    "formal integration of over an interval @xmath69 $ ] results in an exact update through @xmath70 where the _ time - averaged _ flux @xcite is defined as @xmath71 moreover , a taylor expansion of @xmath72 and a change of variables yields @xmath73 which can be inserted into . in a numerical discretization of",
    ", the taylor series in is truncated after a finite number of terms .    if @xmath74 , then reduces to a forward euler time discretization for hyperbolic conservation law .",
    "this fact will allow us to incorporate positivity - preserving limiters into the lax - wendroff flux construction .",
    "this observation allows us to incorporate the positivity - preserving limiters that are presented in ",
    "[ sec : zh - limiter ] and  [ subsec : mpp - limiter ] , because we view the lxw - dg method as a method of modified fluxes .",
    "we now describe how to compute the temporal derivative terms : @xmath75 that are required to define the time - averaged flux in .",
    "this discussion is applicable to high - order finite difference methods , finite volume methods ( e.g. , ader ) , as well as discontinuous galerkin finite element methods .",
    "a single application of the chain rule to compute the time derivative of the flux function yields @xmath76 where the flux jacobian is @xmath77 the matrix - vector products in can be compactly written using the einstein summation convention ( where repeated indices are assumed to be summed over ) , which produces a vector whose @xmath78-component is @xmath79 a second derivative of yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the hessian with elements given by @xmath82 equations and are generic formulae ; the equalities are appropriate for any two - dimensional hyperbolic system , and similar identities exist for three dimensions .",
    "the first product in the right hand side of is understood as a hessian - vector product .",
    "scripts that compute these derivatives , as well as the matrix , and hessian vector products that are necessary to implement a third - order lax - wendroff scheme for multidimensional euler equations can be found in the open source software finess @xcite .",
    "finally , these two time derivatives are sufficient to construct a third - order accurate method by defining the time - averaged flux through @xmath83 and then updating the solution through @xmath84 in place of .",
    "the final step is to construct a fully discrete version of .",
    "the lxw - dg scheme follows the following process @xcite :    * step 1 . * : :    at each quadrature point evaluate the numerical flux ,    @xmath85 , and then integrate this numerical flux    against basis functions to obtain a galerkin expansion of    @xmath86 inside each element .",

    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : bcs ] .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath91 be the unit tangent and unit normal vectors to the boundary at the boundary point @xmath102 , respectively . in both the reflective and transparent boundary conditions , we enforce continuity of the tangential components : @xmath105 the only difference between the two types of boundary conditions we consider lie in the normal direction .",
    "we set @xmath106 where the minus sign corresponds to the reflective boundary condition and the plus sign corresponds to the transparent boundary condition .",
    "from this we can easily write out the full boundary conditions at the point @xmath107 : @xmath108 where again the minus sign corresponds to the reflective boundary condition and the plus sign corresponds to the transparent boundary condition .    in order to achieve high - order time accuracy",
    "we need apply the above boundary conditions to the time derivatives on the boundary : @xmath109 where all time derivatives must be replaced by spatial derivatives using the pde .",
    "the temporal evolution described in the previous section fails to retain positivity of the solution , even in the simple case of linear advection with smooth solutions that are near zero .",
    "in fact , in extreme cases the projection of the initial conditions can fail to retain positivity of the solution due to the gibbs phenomena .",
    "the positivity - preserving limiter we present follows a two step procedure :    * step 1 . *",
    ": :    limit the moments in the expansion so that the solution is positive at    each quadrature point .",
    "* step 2 . * : :    limit the fluxes so that the cell averages retain positivity after a    single time step .",

    "this section describes a procedure that implements the following : if the cell averages are positive , then the solution is forced to be positive at a preselected and finite collection of quadrature points .",
    "we select only the quadrature points that are actually used in the numerical update ; this includes internal gauss quadrature points as well as face / edge gauss quadrature points . unlike other positivity limiting schemes @xcite in the ssp runge - kutta framework ,",
    "this step is not strictly necessary to guarantee positivity of the cell average at the next time - step ; however , the main reason for applying the limiter at quadrature points is to guarantee that each term in the update is physical , which will reduce the total amount of additional limiting of the cell average updated needed in section [ subsec : mpp - limiter ] . the process to maintain positivity at quadrature points",
    "is carried out in a series of three simple steps . because this part of the limiter is entirely local ,",
    "we focus on a single element @xmath110 , and therefore drop the subscript for ease of notation .",
    "we assume that the cell averages for the density satisfies @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a cutoff parameter that guarantees hyperbolicity of the system . in this work , we set @xmath113 in all simulations .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the cell average for the pressure satisfies @xmath114 , where the ( average ) pressure @xmath115 is defined through the averages of the other conserved quantities in .",
    "note that these two conditions are sufficient to imply that the average energy @xmath116 is positive .      in this step",
    ", we enforce positivity of the density at each quadrature point @xmath117 . because @xmath111 , there exists a ( maximal ) value @xmath118 $ ] such that @xmath119 for all quadrature points @xmath117 and all @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "note that we drop the subscript that indicates the element number to ease the complexity of notation for the the ensuing discussion .",
    "recall that the pressure is defined through the relation .",
    "we seek to guarantee that @xmath121 for each quadrature point @xmath122 .",
    "in place of working directly with the pressure , we observe that it suffices to guarantee that the product of the density and pressure is positive . to this end",
    ", we expand the momentum and energy in the same free parameter @xmath30 .",
    "similar to the density in , we write the momentum and energy as @xmath123 we define deviations from cell averages as @xmath124 and compactly write the expression for the limited variables as the cell average plus deviations : @xmath125    the product of the density and pressure at each quadrature point is a quadratic function of @xmath30 : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is defined in . after expanding each of these conserved variables in the _ same scaling parameter",

    "in particular , we are interested in finding the largest such @xmath30 ( i.e. , the least amount of damping ) . instead of exactly computing the optimal @xmath30 , which could readily be done , but would require additional floating point operations , we make use of the following lemma @xcite to find an approximately optimal @xmath30 .    the pressure function is a convex function of @xmath30 on @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "that is , @xmath137 for all , and @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "we observe that directly from the definition of the limiter for the conserved variables in that @xmath139 and therefore @xmath140 the final inequality follows because @xmath141 for all @xmath142 , and the pressure is a convex function ( of the conserved variables ) whenever the density is positive .    as a consequence of we",

    "finally , we define the scaling parameter for the entire cell as @xmath145 and use this value to limit the higher order coefficients in the galerkin expansions of the density , momentum , and energy displayed in eqns . and .",
    "this definition gives us the property that @xmath146 and @xmath147 at each quadrature point @xmath148 .",
    "this process is repeated ( locally ) in each element @xmath11 in the mesh . as a side benefit to guaranteeing that the density and pressure are positive",
    ", we have the following remark .",
    "if @xmath127 and @xmath149 are positive at each quadrature point , then @xmath150 is also positive at each quadrature point .",
    "divide   by @xmath151 and add @xmath152 to both sides .",
    "this concludes the first of two steps for retaining positivity of the solution .",
    "we now move on to the second and final step , which takes into account the temporal evolution of the solver .",
    "the procedure carried out for the flux limiter presented in this section is very similar to recent work for finite volume @xcite as well as finite difference @xcite methods . when compared to the finite difference methods ,",
    "the main difference in this discussion is that the expressions do not simplify as much because quantities such as the edge lengths must remain in the expressions .",
    "this makes them more similar to work on finite volume schemes @xcite .",
    "overall however , there is little difference between flux limiters on cartesian and unstructured meshes , and between flux limiters for finite difference , finite volume ( fv ) , and discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) schemes .",
    "this is because the updates for the cell average in a dg solver can be made to look identical to the update for a fv solver , and once flux interface values are identified , a conservative fd method can be made to look like a fv solver , albeit with a different stencil for the discretization .",
    "all of the aforementioned papers rely on the result of perthame and shu @xcite , which states that a first - order finite volume scheme ( i.e. , one that is based on a piecewise constant representation with forward euler time - stepping ) that uses the lax - friedrichs ( lxf ) numerical flux is positivity - preserving under the usual cfl condition . similar to previous work , we leverage this idea and incorporate it into a flux limiting procedure . here , the focus is on lax - wendroff discontinuous galerkin schemes .    in this work we write out the details of the limiting procedure only for the case of 2d triangular elements .",
    "however , all of the formulas generalize to higher dimensions and cartesian meshes .",
    "to begin , we consider the euler equations and a mesh that fits the description given in ",
