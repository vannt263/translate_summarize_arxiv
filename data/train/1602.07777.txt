    "quantum gravity is referred to a theory unifying the general relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the primary obstacle in developing such a theory is lacking testable experiments of quantum gravitational effects . previously studies are usually based on high - energy astronomical events @xcite with energy in the order of @xmath0 gev , where the general relativity are expected to merge with quantum physics . while the emergence of a minimal length scale predicted by various approaches to quantum gravity provides possibilities to find first ever experimental evidence in low - energy quantum mechanics realm .",
    "specifically , the existence of minimal length scale is against the heisenberg uncertainty relation and motivates the proposal of a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) .",
    "thus , it s generally believed that quantum gravity can be tested to perform high - sensitivity measurement of the uncertainty relation . in this sense , many proposals are aimed to disclose derivations from the predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics ( qm ) based on uncertainty relation .",
    "this motivated a growing number of approaches to search for evidence of planck - scale physics which raised the hope to get experimental direct access to the gravity induced effects .",
    "refs.@xcite expounded the feasibility of study planck - scale physics in a tabletop experiment by observing the motion of a dielectric macroscopic block through a distance of the order of planck s length .",
    "@xcite proposed schemes to measure possible planck - scale deformation with optomechanics in an unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "@xcite measured the change in the oscillator ground - state energy induced by modified commutator with gravitational bar detectors .",
    "all those proposals are based on the consensus that the quantization of spacetime for macroscopic objects is same as that for its constituent particles",
    ". however , camelia challenged this assertion and point out that the spacetime quantization is much weaker for center - of - mass of a macroscopic body compared with fundamental particles constitute it @xcite . according to the conclusion of camelia ,",
    "new approaches pertaining fundamental particles should be came up with to detect quantum gravity effects , instead of focusing on schemes concerning the center - of - mass motions of macroscopic objects .",
    "the ion trap system has been widely studied for its many advantages like long coherent time . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to detect the quantum gravity effects with a two - level ion trapped in a paul trap . by manipulating the phase of classical laser addressing the ion , a sequence of four interactions between ion and laser",
    "is designed such that a phase is accumulated on a specific ground state during the oscillating period of ion external motion . by repeating the cycle and controlling cycle times ,",
    "the phase obtained by standard quantum mechanics is washed out and thus the deformation related phase corresponding to the derivation result from quantum gravity effects can be extracted . after a hadmard transformation with another auxiliary level , the deformation of phase is mapped into the population change , which can be detected with a high accuracy . in the case of a null result of detection , an upper bound for @xmath1 can be set . in this way , we provide a method to perfect the quantum gravity theories with empirical feed back .",
    "moreover , since only a single ion is concerned , our scheme can avoid the errors referred in @xcite introduced by macroscopic probes .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle allows localizing a particle sharply at a point at the expense of the information on the conjugate momentum . while when quantum gravity is considered , uncertainty principle need to be generalized to incorporate the effect of minimal length scale @xcite .",
    "@xmath2    where @xmath1 is the deformed parameters that quantifies the modification strength , @xmath3 is the planck mass and @xmath4 is planck energy @xmath5 . it has been proved that gup is equivalent to a modified canonical commutator in the following form @xcite ,    @xmath6=i\\hbar ( 1+\\beta _ { 0}(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{m_{p}c})^{2}).\\ ] ]    let us define @xcite @xmath7the operators with and without a hat represent deformed and standard operators respectively , and @xmath8 .",
    "note that , the modified heisenberg algebra ( 2 ) is satisfied to order @xmath9 , we thus neglect the terms of higher order throughout the paper .",
    "next , we proceed to elaborate our scheme to measure deformations from ordinary qm . considering a two - level ion trapped in a paul trap ,",
    "the transition between ground state @xmath10 and exited state @xmath11 is driven by four laser fields with frequency @xmath12 @xmath13 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath14 are respectively detuned by @xmath15 and @xmath16 from the @xmath17 transition and have a relative detuning @xmath18 , equivalent to the frequency of the vibrational mode of the ion .",
    "the frequencies @xmath19 have the opposite detuning corresponding to @xmath14 respectively while the same relative detuning @xmath20 the total hamiltonian of the system in the framework of gup takes the form    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are rabi frequency , wave vector and phase of the @xmath25th laser field , respectively .",
    "for one dimensional case , we project the wave vectors on @xmath26 direction , @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath28 are rewritten into @xmath29where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the position operators of ion at @xmath32 instead of taking a continuing interaction between laser fields and ion throughout the whole oscillator period @xmath33 , we turn on the interaction sharply at every quarter of the period , @xmath34 @xmath35 for a relatively short time @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "regardless of the external lasers , the evolution of ion is a modified harmonic oscillation following @xmath38 . in this case , the dynamics of the position operators is obtained by the unitary transformation @xmath39",
    "@xcite    @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41(@xmath42 is the canonical creation ( annihilation ) operator of vibrational mode .",
    "while when @xmath43 $ ] , where lasers are turned on for a sufficient short duration @xmath44 the harmonic evolution can be neglected and @xmath45    in the case of large detuning @xmath46 , we may adiabatically eliminate the excited atomic state @xmath47 since no population transfers to this state providing the ion is initially populated on the ground state .",
    "thus , with james method @xcite , we obtain a effective hamiltonian for the interaction between ion and laser fields during the time interval @xmath48 $ ] ,    @xmath49 \\left\\vert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle g\\right\\vert . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and we have assumed that @xmath51 to eliminate the time - independent stark shift . since oscillating frequency @xmath52 ,",

    "specifically , at the initial time @xmath57  the phases are adjusted to be in the relation @xmath58 thus the effective hamiltonian is simplified to    @xmath59 \\left\\vert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle g\\right\\vert .",

    "substitute the @xmath62 and @xmath63 obtained from eq(7 ) into eq.(10 ) , we can get the time - independent hamiltonian    @xmath64    where @xmath65 stands for the canonical position operator in schdinger picture . considering @xmath66 @xmath67 the time evolution operator @xmath68 takes the form    @xmath69,\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 for @xmath71 the interaction between laser and ion is turned off and the external motion of ion is just a modified harmonic oscillation following @xmath38 . at @xmath72 , @xmath73 evolves to @xmath74 .",
    "meanwhile we change the phases of laser fields to @xmath75 thus the corresponding hamiltonian for the second time interval @xmath76 $ ] takes the form ( see appendix b for more details ) ,    @xmath77    and time evolution operator @xmath78where @xmath79 . similarly , we adjust the phases at @xmath80 to satisfy @xmath81 thus , the interaction hamiltonian during @xmath82 $ ] takes the form @xmath83 subsequently , @xmath84after another quarter of vibrational period , the laser phases are adjusted to @xmath85 by this time , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath53 and @xmath86 during @xmath87 $ ] are @xmath88eventually , assuming the ion is initially populated on the ground state @xmath89 the final state of the system after a round trip consisted of four interaction sequences is    @xmath90    conspicuously , an additional phase proportional to @xmath9 is produced by the deformation of the canonical commutator due to the existence of minimal length scale .",
    "particularly , by choosing the parameters properly such that @xmath91 @xmath25 is an integer , the contribution from the @xmath9 term only can be extracted . in this case , the deformations of the ordinary quantum mechanics are present in a form of accumulated phase during the periodic evolution , which can be measured straightforwardly .    to enlarge the effects induced by quantum gravity , we repeat the procedure for another @xmath92 times . specifically ,",
    "we repeat the interaction sequences subsequently at the time @xmath34 @xmath93 note that , the @xmath9 terms actually form a arithmetic progression with a tolerance @xmath94 while the ordinary phase remains unchanged for every cycle . in this way",
    ", the final state at @xmath95 after @xmath96 times cycles can be calculated easily @xmath97where@xmath98note that , @xmath99 is corresponding to the phase governed by standard quantum mechanics , while @xmath100 is a possible deviation result from gup .",
    "now we proceed to apply our theory to a real system and propose a scheme to measure the phase .",

    "the lifetime of @xmath11 is not relevant in our scheme due to the adiabatic elimination adopted above and the lifetime of ground states @xmath108 is considered infinite .",
    "the lifetime of metastable @xmath106 state is @xmath109 ms @xcite which is three orders of magnitude larger than the time scale required for fluorescence detection @xcite and there is no population in @xmath106 before the hadmard transformation .",
    "therefore the lifetime of @xmath106 can be ignored .",

    "@xcite proposed a novel technique to measure the branching fractions of @xmath137ca@xmath102 based on repetitive optical pumping , which improved the accuracy of precision measurement to about 1 part in @xmath138 . with the state of the art accuracy , we are able to set a new bound @xmath139 , which would improve the existing bounds for @xmath1 by nine orders of magnitude .

    "we can see , with an increasing storage time , lower vibrational frequency and a more accurate measurements in the future , the upper bounds are expected to be tightened by several orders of magnitude .",

    "interestingly , @xmath144 for the case of @xmath141be@xmath102 with the parameters listed .",
    "thus , the phase corresponding to the standard quantum mechanics is eliminated , and the phase accumulated after @xmath145 loops is only attribute to quantum gravity .",
    "so far , our scheme is based on the assumption that the interaction with environment can be neglected .",
    "actually , decoherence effect such as thermal motion of ion is not likely to spoil the fidelity due to the virtual excitations of vibrational mode .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of vibrational mode are disappeared after the four interaction sequences , leaving the vibrational mode invariable .",
    "the independence of vibrational mode remind us of the elimination of sm model @xcite , while our scheme is realized on a different mechanism based on manipulating of laser phases .",
    "the key of our scheme is the precision control of the interaction time @xmath36 such that the dynamics of frequency down to @xmath146 scale can be neglected during interaction time interval @xmath36 . to do this",
    "the external laser fields are required to turn on and off within a few ps and the trap frequency is in khz scale .",
    "the bounds set by our scheme can be tightened with a lower trap frequency , more accurate measurements and longer trap lifetime .",
    "the basic properties of macroscopic bodies , such as spacetime geometry and measurement process , are not available at the moment , and microscope atoms are much more likely to be affected by the full strength of planck - scale effects than macroscopic reality .",
    "thus , our scheme provides a method to detect possible effects induced by quantum gravity and circumvents the unpredictable deformation of spacetime quantization when probing with microscopic body . at the same time , the null results of probing can be used to explore the bounds of quantum gravity parameters and signal a intermediate length scale smaller than planck scale .",
