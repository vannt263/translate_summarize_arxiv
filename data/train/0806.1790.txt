    "oxides of the fluorite structure include zro@xmath9 , a common ceramic in research and industry , ceo@xmath9 , and the actinide oxides tho@xmath9 , uo@xmath9 , and puo@xmath9 .",
    "the series of actinide dioxides is of great interest in nuclear applications .",
    "the present generation of nuclear reactors uses uo@xmath9 as nuclear fuel .",
    "fast breeder reactors at present employ mixed ( u , pu)o@xmath9 , and may in the future use ( u , th)o@xmath9 . in the oxides of the fluorite or caf@xmath9 structure , mo@xmath9 , each metal atom m is surrounded by eight equivalent nearest - neighbor o atoms each of which in turn is surrounded by a tetrahedron of four equivalent m atoms .",
    "a typical feature of the fluorite structure is the large ( @xmath10,@xmath10,@xmath10 ) octahedral holes in which interstitial ions can easily be accommodated .",
    "fluorite structure of uo@xmath9 transforms to an orthorhombic _ pnma _ phase under a hydrostatic compression beyond 40gpa , which in turn followed by an iso - structural transition after 80gpa.@xcite at ambient pressure , however , it exists as the single phase , stoichiometric oxide at all temperature up to 2073k . above",
    "that it transforms to the sub - stoichiometric phase uo@xmath11 , whereas at lower temperatures it easily dissolves large amounts of interstitial oxygen to form _ anion - excess _ compositions uo@xmath5 .",
    "higher interstitial concentration leads to another ordered phase u@xmath7o@xmath8 , which closely relates to fluorite structure.@xcite it was argued that stoichiometric u@xmath7o@xmath8 does not exist , and should be u@xmath7o@xmath12 actually.@xcite but for simplicity we still use u@xmath7o@xmath8 to refer to the non - stoichiometric phase hereinafter .",
    "there are three polymorphs of u@xmath7o@xmath8 between room temperature and 1273k , known as @xmath13,@xmath6,@xmath14 , with the @xmath15 boundary at 353k and the @xmath16 boundary at about 873k .",
    "only the detailed atomic arrangement in @xmath6-phase is clearly determined : the excess anions accommodate in _ cuboctahedral clusters _ centered on the 12-fold sites of the cubic space group @xmath17 with",
    "the uranium sublattice remains _",
    "undisturbed_.@xcite although the unit cell is 64 times larger than a normal cubic fluorite cell , the _ average cell _ is still in fluorite - type except one has to introduce some vacancies at normal anions sites and two types of interstitial oxygen , each sited about 1@xmath18 from the empty octahedral site of the fcc cation sublattice along @xmath19 ( o@xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( o@xmath4 ) direction , respectively .",
    "this characteristic is also shared by the @xmath13-phase@xcite and uo@xmath5,@xcite with the difference that u@xmath7o@xmath8 has a long - range ordering for the interstitial oxygen atoms while in uo@xmath5 it is just short - range ordered . to avoid some oxygens too close together , an intuitive proposal that different kinds of oxygen defect are associated to form _ defect clusters",
    "_ is widely adopted when modeling these phases.@xcite    at first sight the fact that interstitials were detected not at the body centers of the cubic interstitial sites but at sites considerably displaced from this symmetric position is puzzling . in rare earth doped alkaline earth fluorides it has conclusively shown that at low interstitial concentrations ( 1 mole % or less ) the anions occupy the symmetric body center interstitial site , but usually the low - symmetry defect structure is a general feature of anion - excess fluorites.@xcite about half century has elapsed , people still know few about the stabilization mechanism of willis o@xmath20 and o@xmath4 sites in energetics . in the limit of @xmath22 in uo@xmath5 , whether the excess - anions will occupy the octahedral interstitial site or not is still _",
    "unclear_. on the other hand , though the occurrence of cuboctahedral clusters in @xmath6-u@xmath7o@xmath8 has been confirmed by experiments , the geometry of defect clusters in low interstitial concentration regime is unknown .",
    "one of the simplest model is to assume the willis 2:2:2 cluster ( see ref .",
    "[ ] for its geometry ) can exist independently and distribute randomly in the material around this concentration .",
    "allen proposed a model for u@xmath7o@xmath8 in this line by chaining 2:2:2 clusters along @xmath19 direction.@xcite unfortunately his model is definitely wrong because the inconsistencies with experimental facts in : ( 1 ) leads to an exact stoichiometric u@xmath7o@xmath8 , which might not exist ; ( 2 ) no cuboctahedral clusters can be formed in his arrangement ; ( 3 ) has an equal concentration for o@xmath20 and o@xmath4 sites , against the measurements that o@xmath4 position has a much lower occupancy.@xcite    therefore to investigate the geometry and stability of possible defect clusters with a first principles method is required , but it never be easy .",
    "the big unit cell of u@xmath7o@xmath8 and the shortage of information about atomic arrangement in uo@xmath5 have restricted most of attempts within _ point defect _ approximation , and only formation energy of simple intrinsic defects ( frenkel pairs and schottky defect ) were calculated.@xcite applied these energies to point defect model ( pdm),@xcite however , did not produce satisfactory _ defect populations _  uranium vacancy dominates in the hyperstoichiometric regime , against the experimental anticipation.@xcite the failure might be attributed to the limitation of the pdm which assumes isolated non - interacting point defects , whereas in uo@xmath5 this is impossible when @xmath23 , as we will show later .",
    "also it can arise from the inaccurate energies produced by the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of the electronic density functional that has been proven failed to describe _ localized states_.@xcite nevertheless , some qualitative properties still can access by static calculations within this model . for example",
    "the diffusion rate of interstitials can be modeled simply by estimating the migration energy along all possible paths that bridge the initial and finial interstitial positions , which is readily computable by _ ab initio _ nudged elastic band ( neb ) algorithm . for uo@xmath5 ,",
    "the conclusion is that a direct diffusion is almost prohibited and a normal oxygen on fluorite lattice site must be involved as an intermediate process .",
    "that is , the interstitial atom pushes a neighboring lattice oxygen into another interstitial site and itself jumps into the vacancy thus created ( _ interstitialcy _ mechanism).@xcite the extreme of this process is , evidently , creating a transient oxygen dimer , and thus sets up an _ upper bound _ to the migration energy for thermodynamical diffusion of oxygens . in order to keep the occurrence probability of oxygen dimer being consistent with experimental observation in bulk u@xmath7o@xmath8,@xcite the energy required to form a such kind of dimer should be much larger than the average migration energy .",
    "but this has not yet been confirmed by _",
    "ab initio _ calculations .",
    "near to the surface of uo@xmath9 that exposed to air , however , oxygen dimer might become prevailing due to _ oxidations_. and their stability in uo@xmath9 matrix may shed some light on the mechanism of how the material dissolve o@xmath9 molecules into individual interstitials . also , it serves as to verify the willis assumption that _",
    "each o@xmath4 interstitial has to be associating with one vacancy that occupies the nearest oxygen site_,@xcite since otherwise they must form an oxygen dimer .",
    "these motivate the research work of this paper that mainly focuses on : ( 1 ) the stability of isolated point oxygen interstitial in uo@xmath5 when @xmath22 ; ( 2 ) the stability and decomposition process of oxygen dimer , including the variations of energy , cell volume and charges , respectively ; ( 3 ) the local stability of defect clusters that composed of oxygen vacancies , o@xmath20 and o@xmath4 interstitials .",
    "these clusters can be viewed as fractal pieces of a cuboctahedral cluster , which is the essential in u@xmath7o@xmath8 phase .",
    "it is believed that the transition from uo@xmath5 to u@xmath7o@xmath8 involves _ long - range ordering _ of the defect complexes , leading to a change in the symmetry relating the relative positions of the complexes , without producing any atomic re - arrangement within these complexes , _",
    "i.e_. , micro - domains of u@xmath7o@xmath8 should already exist in uo@xmath5.@xcite what we also want to find out primarily in this paper is what kind of cluster is the most possible candidate for this complex , and its polymorphs when @xmath3 is increased . in next section",
    "we will brief the calculation method .",
    "main results and discussions are presented in section [ sec : discuss ] : sec.[sec : forme ] devotes to formation energy analysis and sec.[sec : charge ] the charge transfers , in sec.[sec : o - dimer ] and [ sec : vibf ] we will discuss the properties of oxygen dimer in uo@xmath9 and its decomposition process .",
    "the defect clustering pattern and its tendency with increased @xmath3 are given in sec.[sec : clustering ] , while in sec.[sec : concentration ] a generalization of pdm to include clustering effects is proposed , as well as the associated defect population analysis . finally in sec.[sec :",
    "conclu ] we summarize the paper .",
    "our investigation on defective behavior of uo@xmath9 based on a series of total energy calculations with different configurations in fluorite structure which varied in simulation cell size and defect arrangement .",
    "the plane - wave method using density functional theory ( dft ) to treat the electronic energy as implemented in vasp code@xcite was employed , as well as the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials.@xcite the @xmath24 electrons in oxygen and @xmath25 in uranium were treated in valence space . the cutoff for kinetic energy of plane waves",
    "was set as high as 500ev to eliminate the possible pulay stress erroneous .",
    "also it has been elevated due to the presence of oxygen which requires an energy cutoff at least 400ev to converge the electronic energy within a few @xmath26ev .",
    "integrations over reciprocal space were performed in the irreducible brillouin zone with about 8@xmath2736 non - equivalent k - points , depending on the system size . the energy tolerance for charge self - consistency convergence",
    "was set to @xmath28ev for all calculations . and",
    "the total convergence of this parameter set was checked well . without a specific statement ,",
    "all structures in following discussions have been fully relaxed to get all hellman - feynman forces ( stress ) less than @xmath29ev /  .",
    "the electronic exchange - correlation energy was computed by spin - polarized local density approximation with an effective on - site coulomb interaction to split the partially filled 5__f _ _ bands localized on uranium atoms ( lsda+u).@xcite parameters of the hubbard term were taken as @xmath30ev and @xmath31ev , which has been checked carefully for _ fluorite _ uo@xmath9.@xcite here some comments are desired .",
    "it is well known that it is the @xmath32 but @xmath33 that contributes to electronic structure sensitively . in uo@xmath9 case ,",
    "the value of @xmath32 quite depends on the atomic arrangement of uranium atoms.@xcite if uranium sublattice almost being unchanged , as the case here concerned , one can expect the @xmath32 would not vary too much . on the other hand , the influence of interstitial oxygens on localized 5@xmath34 electrons should be small if they are well separated from uranium atoms .",
    "however , as interstitial concentration increased , the impact on @xmath32 may become non - negligible .",
    "therefore we must restrict to certain composition regime , and @xmath35 should be small enough to allow using this set of parameters . this composition value can be estimated roughly by checking the induced deformation on the uranium sublattice . the situation of uranium defects is a little embarrassed .",
    "we can not estimate its effect on @xmath32 until a more accurate functional becomes generally available , for example , the hybrid density functional that has shown impressive versatility in preliminary applications.@xcite however , for a point defect in a large enough cell , to neglect this influence seems reasonable .",
    "another point is about the adoption of lsda+u functional instead of gga+u .",
    "the latter has been proven as of a poor description to the defect energetics , which we will discuss in details in sec.[sec : concentration ] .",

    "here we use @xmath47 and @xmath48 to model the point defects , thus @xmath49 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be obtained by timing 8 to the corresponding cohesive energies listed in table [ tab : cohee ] .",
    "the formation energies of the defects obtained are listed in table [ tab : fe - fs ] .",
    "they are compared to the previous theoretical results @xcite and pdm estimates based on diffusion measurements.@xcite note that the gga+u employed the same @xmath32 parameter as in this work .",
    "a detailed comparison of its results with lsda+u can be found in ref .",
    "[ ] . despite it produced a similar band gap and local magnetic moment as lsda+u , it predicted a _ big _ lattice constant @xmath50 . by figure",
    "[ fig : pot - sp1 ] we know this would lead to an underestimation of the oxygen interaction with the matrix .",
    "table [ tab : fe - fs ] proves this by showing a smaller absolute value of the oxygen interstitial and vacancy formation energies than any other calculations .",
    "however , this failure is not from gga but the parameter of @xmath32.@xcite besides , this @xmath32 also underestimates the formation energy of uranium interstitial greatly , implying one needs to fitting an own @xmath32 value for gga functional separately .",
    "the improvement of lsda+u over the pure gga or lda results is significant .",
    "both the latter underestimate the formation energy of uranium vacancy by about 2 times , and @xmath51 for oxygen vacancy . by the lump",
    ", lsda+u corrects the energy for o - fp by a @xmath1 and @xmath52 , a @xmath53 and @xmath54 for u - fp , an @xmath55 and @xmath56 for schottky defect over gga and lda , respectively .",
    "this correctness makes our lsda+u results the first _ ab initio _ defect formation energies that _ predict _ the predominance of oxygen defects within a broad enough stoichiometric range over uranium ones ( for the performances of lda or gga formation energies and the pdm anticipation , please see refs .",
    "the defect concentrations , or equivalently populations , calculated with pdm equations are shown in figure [ fig : conc - pdm ] .",
    "an arbitrary temperature of 1700k is chosen .",
    "we see oxygen interstitial dominates when @xmath57 while it is oxygen vacancy when @xmath58 . at @xmath59 ,",
    "o - fp overwhelms .",
    "this picture is in a good agreement with diffusion measurements _ interpreted _ by pdm,@xcite but different from neutron diffraction data where non - negligible oxygen vacancies were observed when @xmath57.@xcite the population of oxygen vacancy predicted by pdm is too low to be true . to increase this population in the regime @xmath57",
    ", one needs to take clustering effect into account .      .",
    "]    assume the oxygen diagonal pair in @xmath60 is dominant over the single interstitial , one can calculate the clustering effect formally .",
    "it is not a promising assumption due to the small energy difference between them . while it can be used to analyze the influence of _ pure _ interstitial clusters that occupied only the octahedral sites on the vacancy populations ( they should have similar effects ) .",
    "also it serves to show how the independent clusters approximation works out .    using the defect formation energy of @xmath60 and eqs.([eq : pdm2 ] , [ eq : pdm3 ] ,",
    "[ eq : pd1 ] and [ eq : conecntra2 ] ) , we calculated the defect populations following the same manner as pdm , the result is presented in figure [ fig : conc - ica ] .",
    "note here that @xmath61 turns out to have the same numeric value as @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "we see that this pure clustering mechanism do decrease the oxygen interstitial population , but that of oxygen vacancy in the @xmath57 regime is still too low .",
    "another problem raised here is the population of uranium vacancy is closely pinned on that of the oxygen interstitial .",
    "it is not what we wanted .",
    "roughly , figure [ fig : conc - ica ] suggests clusters associated with oxygen _ vacancies _ is necessary in order to enhance the latter s concentration greatly in @xmath57 regime and to pin on that of oxygen interstitial , as implied by the neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "in summary , we performed a comprehensive calculation on defect properties in uo@xmath0 with lsda+u method .",
    "the volume changes induced by defects and their formation energies were computed accurately .",
    "analysis of these energies for a series configurations concluded that defect clustering is unavoidable when @xmath63 , compatible with experimental fact .",
    "atomic charge calculations in bader s definition , however , showed the difficulty to oxidize uranium to u@xmath64 and the charged oxygen apt to losing its electrons , against common expectation .",
    "as the simplest interstitial cluster , oxygen dimer behaviors in a manner similar to a normal oxygen in energetics and charge state .",
    "it was identified as ionic dioxygen molecule with two excess electrons .",
    "static and vibrational free energy calculations , however , showed it quite unstable and might only be a transient state during oxidization process .",
    "oxygen dimer is the extreme case for interstitialcy diffusion of oxygen , which may induce a charge fluctuation with a magnitude less than @xmath65 .",
    "it also presents as a special case for willis o@xmath4 site occupancy under stretch . the stabilization mechanism for this site under ambient conditions ,",
    "however , is attributed to a v-2o@xmath4(o@xmath20 ) triple by the local stability analysis .",
    "also , o@xmath20 site is stabilized only by the nearest oxygen vacancy pair .",
    "this comprises the basic clustering pattern for defects in uo@xmath5 : play with the four building blocks ( v-(2)o@xmath4 and v-(2)o@xmath20-v ) by sharing the vacancy sites .",
    "the actual stability of clusters should be judged by the formation energies , which beyond the scope of this paper and we prefer to future work . a quasi phase diagram for defect clusters vs composition",
    "was also proposed to explain the observed population ratios of o@xmath20 and o@xmath4 sites , which of course requires further refinement step by step when more calculations and experimental data are available .",
    "the formation energy of frenkel pairs and schottky defect calculated with lsda+u have been improved more than @xmath1 over the gga and lda results . with these energies and the point defect model ,",
    "we first time showed the predominance of oxygen defects by first principles .",
    "finally we generalized the pdm to independent clusters approximation that allows us to compute the population of clusters , and revealed the necessity to move on to willis type clusters .",

    "<S> the volume change induced by point uranium defects is monotonic but nonlinear , whereas for oxygen defects , increase @xmath3 always reduces the system volume linearly , except dimers that require extra space for accommodation , which has been identified as meta - stable ionic molecule . though oxygen dimers usually occupy willis o@xmath4 sites and mimic a single oxygen in energetics and charge state , they are rare at ambient conditions . its decomposition process and vibrational properties have been studied carefully . to obtain a general clustering mechanism in anion - excess fluorites systematically </S>",
    "<S> , we also analyze the local stabilities of possible basic clustering modes of oxygen defects . </S>",
    "<S> the result shows an unified way to understand the structure of willis type and cuboctahedral clusters in uo@xmath5 and @xmath6-u@xmath7o@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we generalize the point defect model to the independent clusters approximation to include clustering effects , the impact on defect populations is discussed . </S>"
