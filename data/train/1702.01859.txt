    "multilayer graphene with an additional layer degree of freedom ( in addition to the spin and pseudospin intralayer index ) has recently attracted a great deal of attention for its fundamental properties as well as for its potential applications.@xcite multilayer graphene is not a simple extension of monolayer graphene ( since it has its own characteristic layer - number - dependent band structure and symmetry properties ) , and could open the possibility of engineering electronic properties by tuning the stacking arrangement .",
    "one important salient feature of multilayer graphene is the enhancement of the electronic density of states ( dos ) as the number of graphene layers increases . as a consequence ,",
    "the electronic screening becomes more important with increasing layers.@xcite since the energy band structure of multilayer graphene is very sensitive to its stacking sequence , the screening properties depend strongly on the stacking arrangements in multilayer graphene.@xcite each type of rhombohedral multilayer graphene ( i.e. , @xmath0-graphene ) with the layer number index @xmath1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ... is a distinct 2d material tuned by @xmath0 except that all of them are 2d gapless semimetals with the chemical potential precisely pinned at the touching point of conduction and valence bands .",
    "the most well - known @xmath0-grahenes are monolayer graphene ( mlg ) with @xmath1 and bilayer graphene ( blg ) with @xmath2 , but trilayer ( @xmath3 ) and even higher - layer ( @xmath4 ) graphenes have also been studied in the laboratory.@xcite in fact , the @xmath0 going to infinity limit ( i.e. , infinite - layer graphene ) is graphite .",
    "the current theoretical work is on the @xmath0-dependent magnetic properties of intrinsic ( i.e. , undoped ) multilayer graphene with no free carriers in the conduction or valence band at @xmath5 .",
    "we study finite temperature response ( screening ) functions of multilayer graphene , and their consequences for the @xmath0-dependent magnetic properties induced by magnetic impurities through the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction.@xcite in the presence of a dilute concentration of magnetic impurities in nonmagnetic metals the effective exchange interaction between the impurities is induced as the second - order perturbation with respect to the direct exchange interaction between the magnetic impurity and the itinerant electrons of the host ( i.e. , the magnetic impurities experience a long - range indirect exchange interaction mediated by conduction electrons , known as the rkky interaction ) .",
    "such an indirect nonlocal carrier - mediated rkky interaction between two impurities could be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on their spatial separation because the interaction is oscillatory due to the sharpness of the fermi surface .",
    "this indirect rkky interaction exists in addition to any possible direct exchange interaction among the magnetic impurities which may arise due to their direct wave function overlap . because the rkky interaction is mediated by host electrons ( or holes )",
    ", the enhanced dos of multilayer graphene can lead to an increase of the effective inter - impurity magnetic coupling with increasing @xmath0 , which may induce robust magnetic ordering for larger values of the layer number .",
    "the goal of the current paper is to theoretically predict such magnetic ordering in multilayer graphene as a function of layer number .    in general ,",
    "intrinsic graphene does not have any permanent magnetic moments in the bulk , but local magnetic moments can be introduced by extrinsic doping .",
    "doping by suitable magnetic impurities could introduce such local moments , but these local moments can not order spontaneously unless there is an inter - impurity magnetic interaction . if the impurities are far apart , i.e. , the doping is dilute ( which is the only situation considered in the current work ) , then the direct exchange interaction among the impurities is basically zero since their wave function overlap is exponentially small .",
    "it is also now well - accepted that graphene ( or generally , multilayer graphene ) is not intrinsically ( i.e. , in the absence of any doping ) magnetic , i.e. , there is no spontaneous graphene magnetic ordering of any kind unless local magnetic moments are extrinsically introduced by magnetic impurities , vacancies , or edges.@xcite the important question addressed in this paper is whether a dilute ( i.e. , well - separated impurities ) concentration of magnetic dopants could induce magnetism in graphene through the rkky mechanism with direct exchange playing no role whatsoever .",
    "we emphasize that the dilute limit is very different from the dense ( or kondo lattice ) limit where the magnetic impurities themselves form a lattice ( or are in almost every unit cell of the host lattice ) since direct interaction among the impurities as well as any modification of the graphene band structure induced by the impurities can be neglected .",
    "the only interaction to be considered in this dilute limit is the indirect rkky interaction , and a continuum approximation should suffice .",
    "the dilute approximation with well - separated dopants makes the graphene situation here very similar to the extensively studied @xcite diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) materials where also the primary mechanism driving ferromagnetism in the semiconductor is thought to be the indirect rkky interaction .",
    "this is the physics we investigate in the current work .",
    "the main qualitative difference between diluted - magnetic - graphene ( dmg ) we consider here and the well - studied dms is that we must deal with an undoped gapless semimetal ( and not a doped semiconductor ) and we must incorporate the layer number for multilayer graphene .",
    "it is known that the effective rkky interaction in graphene induced by the exchange coupling between local magnetic moments and conduction electrons ( or holes ) behaves differently from the ordinary two dimensional ( 2d ) systems because of the chiral gapless nature of graphene.@xcite in particular , the strength of rkky coupling in monolayer graphene decays faster spatially than in ordinary 2d electron systems due to chirality ( i.e. , the suppression of the 2@xmath6 scattering , where @xmath6 is the fermi wave vector ) in graphene.@xcite    one may wonder if rkky interaction , with its long - range spatial friedel oscillations , is capable of inducing magnetic ordering since the inter - impurity interaction may be of random sign ( ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) depending on their spatial locations .",
    "this is certainly the case in ordinary metals or semiconductors ( either 2d or 3d)@xcite in the presence of a high concentration of magnetic impurities where the effective inter - impurity interaction will be randomly ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic , leading to considerable frustration in the hamiltonian ( and perhaps therefore a glassy ground state with no obvious long - range order ) .",
    "but for a low or dilute impurity concentration ( as in dms ) where the impurities are on the average far from each other , the effective inter - impurity rkky interaction is on the average mostly ferromagnetic , and then the possibility of magnetic ordering arises , albeit with perhaps a low transition temperature ( as in dms ) because of the generally weakened average inter - impurity rkky interaction.@xcite in multilayer graphene , layer index and chirality introduce novel rkky physics necessitating a specific analysis to search for possible magnetic ordering of dmg . in particular , multilayer graphene rkky interaction does not change sign ( in spite of friedel oscillations ) for @xmath7 indicating a strong tendency toward a long - range ordering of the magnetic impurities induced by rkky coupling .",
    "another fundamental difference between intrinsic graphene and ordinary metals or doped semiconductors is the fact that undoped graphene is a gapless semiconductor or a semimetal with no free carriers at @xmath5 since the chemical potential separates a filled valence band touching an empty conduction band .",
    "taken together , all these differences between chiral intrinsic dmg and regular dms imply that our intuition based on the substantial body of dms literature is a poor guide to understanding how graphene magnetism may arise from rkky physics . in this paper",
    ", we provide a complete picture based on a continuum mean field theory , which should be qualitatively and semiquantitaively valid in the dilute impurity density limit .",
    "magnetic properties of graphene have been studied , and in particular , there have been several studies of rkky interaction in graphene focusing on the possibility of magnetic ordering of dopant magnetic impurities at zero temperature.@xcite however , a systematic study of rkky interaction in multilayer graphene as a function of layer index has not been undertaken , and , in addition , finite temperature , disorder and finite carrier mean - free path effects on rkky interaction have not yet been studied theoretically . in this paper , we calculate the magnetic properties of multilayer graphene with the magnetic impurities located at the interface between graphene and substrate without breaking any symmetry in the graphene layer .",
    "we calculate the temperature dependence of the rkky interaction in multilayer graphene in order to develop a self - consistent field theory to study long - range finite - temperature magnetic ordering .",
    "we show that the enhanced dos in rhombohedral stacking allows ferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic impurities at experimentally accessible temperatures , particularly for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "our results indicate that the magnetic impurity induced ferromagnetic ordering is possible in semimetallic multilayer graphene arising from the rkky indirect interaction in the dilute impurity limit .",
    "ferromagnetism in dmg as predicted in our theory , particularly for larger layer numbers , could in principle lead to graphene spintronics if our predictions are validated experimentally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our model and theoretical approaches based on chiral 2d electron systems . in sec .",
    "iii , we give the calculated results for rkky interaction and the ferromagnetic transition temperatures of dmg .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a discussion of the momentum cutoff effects on the effective coupling .",
    "to study indirect magnetic interaction between quenched local moments in multilayer graphene , we consider the indirect exchange interaction between magnetic impurities to be of the rkky form , i.e. , carrier - mediated effective magnetic interaction .",
    "indirect exchange interaction between magnetic moments is determined by the electronic structure of the relevant system . to describe electron states in multilayer graphene",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian of noninteracting electrons in the form of a two - band pseudospin hamiltonian for 2d chiral quasiparticles .",
    "thus , multilayer graphene near the band - touching dirac point can be described by a set of chiral 2d electron systems ( c2dess ) and the hamiltonian with the chirality index @xmath0 ( which also represents the number of layers in rhombohedral multilayer graphene ) is of the form @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the effective in - plane fermi velocity , and @xmath11 is the nearest - neighbor interlayer hopping .",
    "the hamiltonian has an energy spectrum given by @xmath12 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 for conduction ( valence ) band energy states , respectively .",
    "we consider intrinsic multilayer semimetallic graphene with the fermi energy precisely at the dirac point which we take to be the zero of energy .",
    "the carrier mediated rkky indirect exchange interaction describing the effective magnetic interaction between local moments induced by the free carrier spin polarization is proportional to the static carrier susceptibility .",
    "the finite temperature static susceptibility can be calculated using the finite temperature fermi distribution function as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total degeneracy factor ( @xmath18 are spin and valley degeneracy factors , respectively ) , @xmath19 $ ] is the finite temperature fermi distribution function for the band index @xmath20 and wave vector @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the square of the wave - function overlap between @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , and @xmath25 . for the chiral electron with the chirality index @xmath0 , @xmath26 $ ] . for the undoped intrinsic case , in which the chemical potential is located at the dirac point for all temperatures , eq .",

    ", we have @xmath40 and therefore , for @xmath41 , the static susceptibility diverges at long wavelength .    at finite temperatures ( @xmath42 ) , it is interesting to notice that the interband susceptibility behaves like @xmath43 as @xmath44 for all @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the @xmath45 singular behavior of the interband susceptibility at @xmath5 for @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath46 , disappears at finite temperatures .",
    "in addition , intraband transitions contribute to the susceptibility at finite temperatures due to thermal particle - hole excitations in the semimetal , and thus , at small @xmath29 the total susceptibility comes entirely from the intraband transition at finite @xmath47 , @xmath48 , due to the vanishing of long wavelength interband contribution . especially , we find that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath41 .",

    ". we will discuss the implications of these temperature dependences for @xmath0-dependent long - range magnetic ordering .",

    "we ignore all complications associated with kondo physics and other quantum strong correlation aspects assuming that the long - range heisenberg model is the appropriate model for describing magnetic ordering for dmg .",
    "we essentially assume that the relevant kondo temperature is much less than the rkky temperature scale in the system.@xcite the rkky interaction is related to the range function which is defined by the fourier transform of the static susceptibility , i.e. , @xmath76 and in 2d it is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the bessel functions of the first kind .",

    "<S> we calculate the temperature dependent long - range magnetic coupling in the presence of dilute concentrations of random magnetic impurities in chiral multilayer two - dimensional semimetals , i.e. , undoped intrinsic multilayer graphene . assuming a carrier - mediated indirect rkky exchange interaction among the well - separated magnetic impurities with the itinerant carriers mediating the magnetic interaction between the impurities , we investigate the magnetic properties of intrinsic multilayer graphene using an effective chiral hamiltonian model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that due to the enhanced density of states in the rhombohedral stacking sequence of graphene layers , the magnetic ordering of multilayer graphene is ferromagnetic in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic transition temperature is calculated using a finite - temperature self - consistent field approximation and found to be within the experimentally accessible range for reasonable values of the impurity - carrier coupling . </S>"
