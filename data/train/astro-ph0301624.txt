    "this is the second of four papers in which the properties of @xmath15 early - type galaxies , in the redshift range @xmath16 are studied .",
    "paper i ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003a ) describes how the sample was selected from the sdss database .",
    "the sample is essentially magnitude limited , and the galaxies in it span a wide range of environments .",
    "each galaxy in the sample has measured values of luminosity @xmath1 , effective radius @xmath2 and surface brightness @xmath17 in four bands ( @xmath12 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , a velocity dispersion @xmath4 , a redshift , and an estimate of the local density .",
    "section  [ lf ] of the present paper shows that the luminosity function of the galaxies in our sample , when expressed as a function of absolute magnitude , is well described by a gaussian form , and that the luminosities in the population as a whole appear to be evolving passively .",
    "section  [ lx ] studies the distribution of ( the logarithm of ) velocity dispersion , size , surface - brightness , effective mass and effective density at fixed luminosity ; all of these are quite well described by gaussian forms , suggesting that the intrinsic distributions of log(size ) and log(velocity dispersion ) are , like the distribution of log(luminosity ) , approximately gaussian .",
    "maximum - likelihood estimates of these and other correlations , which include the faber - jackson relation , the mass - to - light ratio , the kormendy relation and a mass  density relation are presented in section  [ ml3d ] .",
    "appendix  [ simul ] describes a method for generating accurate mock complete and magnitude - limited galaxy catalogs , which are useful for assessing the relative importance of evolution and selection effects .",
    "the procedure used to estimate errors on our results is discussed in appendix  [ compcat ] .",
    "paper  iii ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003b ) of this series places special emphasis on the fundamental plane relation between size , surface brightness and velocity dispersion .",
    "it shows how the fp depends on waveband , color , redshift and environment .",
    "paper  iv ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003c ) uses the colors and spectra of these galaxies to provide information about the chemical evolution of the early - type population .    except where stated otherwise , we write the hubble constant as @xmath18 , and we perform our analysis in a cosmological world model with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the present - day scaled densities of matter and cosmological constant . in such a model",
    ", the age of the universe at the present time is @xmath22 gyr . for comparison ,",
    "an einstein - de sitter model has @xmath23 and @xmath24  gyr .",
    "we frequently use the notation @xmath25 as a reminder that we have set @xmath26 .",
    "also , we will frequently be interested in the logarithms of physical quantities .",
    "our convention is to set @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath2 and @xmath4 are effective radii in @xmath29  kpc and velocity dispersions in km  s@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "our sample is magnitude limited ( table  1 of paper  i gives the magnitude limits in the different bands ) .",
    "therefore , we measure the luminosity function of the galaxies in our sample using two techniques .",
    "the first uses volume limited catalogs , and the second uses a maximum likelihood procedure ( sandage , tammann & yahil 1979 ; efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) .    in the first method , we divide our parent catalog into many volume limited subsamples ; this was possible because the parent catalog is so large .",
    "when doing this , we must decide what size volumes to choose .",
    "we would like our volumes to be as large as possible so that each volume represents a fair sample of the universe . on the other hand",
    ", the volumes must not be so large that evolution effects are important .",
    "in addition , because our catalog is cut at the bright as well as the faint end , large - volume subsamples span only a small range in luminosities .",
    "therefore , we are forced to compromise : we have chosen to make the volumes about @xmath31 thick , because @xmath32mpc is larger than the largest structures seen in numerical simulations of the cold dark matter family of models ( e.g. , colberg et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the catalogs are extracted from regions which cover a very wide angle on the sky , so the actual volume of any given volume limited catalog is considerably larger than ( @xmath33mpc)@xmath34 .",
    "therefore , this choice should provide volumes which are large enough in at least two of the three coordinate directions that they represent fair samples , but not so large in the redshift direction that the range in luminosities in any given catalog is small , or that evolution effects are washed out .",
    "the volume - limited subamples are constructed as follows .",
    "first , we specify the boundaries in redshift of the catalog : @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the context of a world model , these redshift limits , when combined with the angular size of the catalog , can be used to compute a volume .",
    "this volume depends on @xmath37 and the world model : as our fiducial model we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "( our results hardly change if we use an einstein de - sitter model instead . )",
    "we then compute the k - corrected limiting luminosities @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 given the apparent magnitude limits , the redshift limits , and the assumed cosmology .",
    "a galaxy @xmath42 is included in the volume limited subsample if @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the luminosity function for the volume limited subsample is obtained by counting the number of galaxies in a luminosity bin and dividing by the volume of the subsample .",
    "=    the top panels in figure  [ lfev ] show the result of doing this in the @xmath12 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "stars , circles , diamonds , triangles , squares and crosses show measurements in volume limited catalogs which have @xmath45 , 0.08 , 0.12 , 0.16 , 0.20 , and 0.24 and @xmath46 .",
    "each subsample contains more than five hundred galaxies , except for the two most distant , which each contain about one hundred .",
    "as one would expect , the nearby volumes provide the faint end of @xmath47 , and the more distant volumes show the bright end . the extent to which the different volume limited catalogs all trace out the same curve is a measure of how little the luminosity function at low and high redshifts differs from that at the median redshift .",
    "the bottom panels in figure  [ lfev ] show evidence that , in fact , the galaxies in our data show evidence for a small amount of evolution : at fixed comoving density , the higher redshift population is slightly brighter than that at lower redshifts .",
    "although volume - limited catalogs provide model - independent measures of this evolution , the test is most sensitive when a large range of luminosities can be probed at two different redshifts . because the sdss catalogs are cut at both the faint and the bright ends , our test for evolution is severely limited",
    ". nevertheless , the small trends we see are both statistically significant , and qualitatively consistent with what one expects of a passively evolving population .",
    "( note that our sample contains only early - type galaxies .",
    "blanton et al .",
    "2001 study the luminosity function in an sdss sample which contains all galaxy types , but they ignore evolution effects .",
    "since late - type galaxies are expected to evolve more rapidly than early - types , it is important to redo blanton et al.s analysis after allowing for evolution . )",
    "before we make more quantitative conclusions , notice that a bell - like gaussian shape would provide a reasonable description of the luminosity function .",
    "although early - type galaxies are expected to have red colors , our sample was not selected using any color information .",
    "it is reassuring , therefore , that the gaussian shape we find here also provides a good fit to the luminosity function of the redder objects in the sdss parent catalog ( see the curves for the two reddest galaxy bins in fig.14 of blanton et al .",
    "a gaussian form also provides a reasonable description of the luminosity function of early - type galaxies in the cnoc2 survey ( lin et al .",
    "1999 , even though they actually fit a schechter function to their measurements ) .",
    "the 2dfgrs galaxies classified as being of type 1 by madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) should be similar to early - types .",
    "their type 1 s extend to considerably fainter absolute magnitudes than our sample and the shape of the luminosity function they report is quite different from ours .",
    "this is probably because the population of early - type galaxies at faint absolute magnitudes is quite different from the brighter ones ( e.g. , sandage & perelmuter 1990 ) . in any case , their schechter function fits underestimate the number density of luminous type 1 galaxies  a gaussian tail would provide a significantly better fit .    given that the gaussian form provides a good description of our data , we use the maximum - likelihood method outlined by sandage , tammann & yahil ( 1979 ) to estimate the parameters of the best - fitting luminosity function . for magnitude limited samples which are small and shallow , this is the method of choice .",
    "for a sample such as ours , which spans a sufficiently wide range in redshifts that evolution effects might be important , the method requires a model for the evolution .",
    "we parametrize the luminosity evolution similarly to lin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . that is to say ,",
    "if we were solving only for the luminosity function , then the likelihood function we maximize would be @xmath48 ^ 2\\over 2\\sigma_m^2}\\right ) , \\nonumber\\\\ s(z_i|q , m_*,\\sigma_m ) & = &    \\int_{m_{\\rm min}(z_i)}^{m_{\\rm max}(z_i ) } dm\\,\\phi(m , z_i|q , m_*,\\sigma_m ) , \\label{mlphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the minimum and maximum absolute magnitudes at @xmath51 which satisfy the apparent magnitude limits of the survey , and @xmath42 runs over all the galaxies in the catalog .",
    "( at small @xmath52 , this parametrization of the evolution in absolute magnitude implies that the luminosity evolves as @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "note that , in assuming that only @xmath55 evolves , this model assumes that there is no differential evolution in luminosities , i.e. , that luminous and not so luminous galaxies evolve similarly .",
    "figure  [ lf4 ] shows the result of estimating the luminosity function in this way in the @xmath12 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands . later in this paper",
    ", we will solve simultaneously for the joint distribution of luminosity , size and velocity dispersion ; it is the parameters which describe the luminosity function of this joint solution which are shown in fig .",
    "the dashed lines in each panel show the gaussian shape of the luminosity function at redshift @xmath56 . for comparison ,",
    "the symbols show the measurements in the same volume limited catalogs as before , except that now we have subtracted the maximum likelihood estimate of the luminosity evolution from the absolute magnitudes @xmath57 before plotting them .",
    "if the model for the evolution is accurate , then the different symbols should all trace out the same smooth dashed curve .",
    "=    =    the comoving number density of the galaxies in this sample is @xmath58mpc@xmath59 in all four bands . because the different bands have different apparent magnitude limits , and they were fit independently of each other ,",
    "it is reassuring that the same value of @xmath60 works for all the bands . for similar reasons , it is reassuring that the best - fit values of @xmath55 imply rest - frame colors at @xmath56 of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , which are close to those of the models which we used to compute our k - corrections ( appendix  a of paper i ) , even though no a priori constraint was imposed on what these rest - frame colors should be .",
    "the histograms in each of the four panels of figure  [ nz4 ] show the number of galaxies observed as a function of redshift in the four bands .",
    "the peak in the number counts at @xmath64 is also present in the full sdss sample , which includes late - types , and , perhaps more surprisingly , an overdensity at this same redshift is also present in the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "( the second bump at @xmath65 is also present in the 2dfgrs counts . )",
    "the solid curves show what we expect to see for the evolving gaussian function fits  the curves provide a reasonably good fit to the observed counts , although they slightly overestimate the numbers at high redshift in the redder wavebands . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed curves show what is expected if the luminosities do not evolve and the no - evolution luminosity function is given by the one at the median redshift ( i.e. , a gaussian with mean @xmath66 ) .",
    "although the fit to the high - redshift tail is slightly better , this no evolution model can not explain the trends shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ lfev ] .",
    "moreover , a bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) passive evolution model with a formation time of 9  gyrs ago , predicts that the rest - frame luminosities at redshift @xmath67 should be brighter than those at @xmath56 by 0.3 , 0.26 , 0.24 , and 0.21  mags in @xmath12 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively  not far off from what we estimate .",
    "the bottom panels in figure  [ lfev ] suggest two possible reasons why our model of pure luminosity evolution overestimates @xmath68 at higher @xmath52 .",
    "one possibility is that the comoving number densities are decreasing slightly with redshift .",
    "a small amount of density evolution is not unexpected , because early - type galaxy morphologies may evolve ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) , and our sample is selected on the basis of a fixed morphology .",
    "if we allow a small amount of density as well as luminosity evolution , and we use @xmath69 with @xmath70 , as suggested by the results of lin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , then the resulting @xmath68 curves are also well fit by the dashed curves .",
    "a second possibility follows from the fact that we only observe the most luminous part of the higher redshift population .",
    "if the most luminous galaxies at any given time are also the oldest , then one might expect the bright end of the luminosity function to evolve less rapidly than the fainter end .",
    "the curvature seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ lfev ] suggests that although the evolution of the fainter objects in our sample ( which we only see out to low redshifts ) is consistent with formation times of 9  gyrs ago , the brighter objects are not . models of differential evolution in the luminosities also predict @xmath68 distributions which are in better agreement with the observed counts at high redshift .",
    "since the evolution of the luminosity function is small , we prefer to wait until we are able to make more accurate k - corrections before accounting for either of these other possibilities more carefully .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will continue to use the model with pure luminosity evolution .",
    "repeating the exercise described above but for an einstein  de - sitter model yields qualitatively similar results , although the actual values of @xmath55 and @xmath60 are slightly different . at face value ,",
    "the fact that we see so little evolution in the luminosities argues for a relatively high formation redshift : the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models indicate that @xmath71  gyrs .",
    "this section presents scatter plots between different observables @xmath72 and luminosity .",
    "this is done because , except for a cut at small velocity dispersions , our sample was selected by luminosity alone .",
    "this means that the distributions of @xmath72 at fixed luminosity are not biased by the selection cut ( e.g. , schechter 1980 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath72 at fixed @xmath1 is shown to be reasonably well described by a gaussian for all the choices of @xmath72 we consider .",
    "this simplifies the maximum likelihood analysis described in section  [ ml3d ] which we use to estimate a number of observed correlations ( it is also used in paper  iii to estimate the parameters of the fundamental plane ) .",
    "the best way to think of any absolute magnitude @xmath57 versus @xmath72 scatter plot is to imagine that , at fixed absolute magnitude @xmath57 , there is a distribution of @xmath72 values .",
    "the scatter plot then shows the joint distribution @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the density of galaxies with @xmath72 and @xmath57 at @xmath52 , and @xmath75 is the luminosity function at @xmath52 which we computed in section  [ lf ] .",
    "one of the results of this section is to show that the shape of @xmath76 is simple for most of the relations of interest .",
    "the mean value of @xmath72 at fixed @xmath57 is independent of the fact that our catalogs are magnitude limited .",
    "therefore , we estimate the parameters of linear relations of the form : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath72 is the observable ( for example , we will study @xmath79 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) . for each volume limited catalog , we fit for the slope @xmath82 and zero - point of the linear relation .",
    "if there really were a linear relation between @xmath57 and @xmath72 , and neither @xmath72 nor @xmath57 evolved , then the slopes and zero - points of the different volume limited catalogs would be the same .    to illustrate , the different symbols in figure  [ ls ] show @xmath83 , the faber  jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) , in our dataset .",
    "most datasets in the literature are consistent with the scaling @xmath84 , approximately independent of waveband . for example ,",
    "forbes & ponman ( 1999 ) , using a compilation of data from prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) report @xmath85 in the b - band . at longer wavelengths pahre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) report @xmath86 in the k - band , with a scatter of 0.93 mag .",
    "stars , circles , diamonds , triangles , squares and crosses show the relation measured in volume limited catalogs of successively higher redshift ( redshift limits are the same as in figure  [ lfev ] ) .",
    "the galaxies in each subsample were further divided into two equal - sized parts based on luminosity .",
    "the symbols with error bars show the mean @xmath87 for each of these small bins in @xmath57 , and the rms spread around it ( note that the error on the mean is smaller than the size of the symbols in all but the highest redshift catalogs ) .",
    "the solid line shows the maximum - likelihood estimate of the slope of this relation at @xmath56 , which we describe in section  [ prjct ] .",
    "comparison with this line shows that the higher redshift population is slightly brighter .",
    "the slope of this line is shown in the top of each panel : @xmath88 , approximately , in all the bands , consistent with the literature .",
    "the zero point , however , is different ; at fixed luminosity , the objects in our sample have velocity dispersions which are smaller than those reported in the literature by about @xmath89 .",
    "=    =    we have enough data that we can actually do more than simply measure the mean @xmath72 at fixed @xmath57 ; we can also compute the distribution around the mean . if we do this for each catalog",
    ", then we obtain distributions which are approximately gaussian in shape , with dispersions which depend on the range of luminosities which are in the subsample . rather than showing these",
    ", we created a composite catalog by stacking together the galaxies from the nonoverlapping volume limited catalogs , and we then divided the composite catalog into five equal sized bins in luminosity .",
    "the histograms in the bottom of the plot show the shapes of the distribution of velocities in the different luminosity bins . except for the lowest and highest redshift catalogs for which the statistics are poorest , the different distributions have almost the same shape ; only the mean changes .",
    "one might have worried that the similarity of the distributions is a signature that they are dominated by measurement error .",
    "this is not the case : the typical measurement error is about a factor of two smaller than the rms of any of these distributions .",
    "if we assume that the measurement errors are gaussian - distributed , then the distributions we see should be the true distribution broadened by the gaussian from the measurement errors . the fact that the observed distributions are well approximated by gaussians suggests that the true intrinsic distributions are also gaussian .",
    "the fact that the width of the intrinsic distribution is approximately independent of @xmath57 considerably simplifies the maximum likelihood analysis presented in the next section .",
    "it is well known that color is strongly correlated with velocity dispersion ( paper  iv of this series shows the color@xmath90 relation in our sample ) .",
    "one consequence of this is that residuals from the @xmath91 relation shown in figure  [ ls ] correlate strongly with color : at fixed magnitude , the redder galaxies have the highest velocity dispersions .",
    "in addition , as a whole , the reddest galaxies populate the high @xmath4 part of the relation .",
    "forbes & ponman ( 1999 ) reported that residuals from the faber ",
    "jackson relation correlate with age .",
    "if color is an indicator of age and/or metallicity , then our finding is qualitatively consistent with theirs : the typical age / metallicity varies along the faber ",
    "jackson relation .    a similar study of the relation between the luminosities and sizes of galaxies",
    "is shown in figure  [ lre ] .",
    "schade et al . (",
    "1997 ) find @xmath92 in the b band , whereas , at longer wavelengths , pahre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find @xmath93 with an rms of 0.88  mag .",
    "this suggests that the relation depends on wavelength .",
    "we find @xmath94 in @xmath12 , but @xmath95 in the other bands .",
    "the distribution @xmath96 is also reasonably well fit by a gaussian , with a mean which increases with luminosity , and a dispersion which is approximately independent of @xmath57 .",
    "the rms around the mean is about one and a half times larger than the rms around the mean @xmath91 relation .",
    "we argue in paper  iv that the color  magnitude and color  size relations are a consequence of the color@xmath90 correlation .",
    "if this is correct , then residuals from the @xmath97 relation , should not correlate with size or magnitude .",
    "we have checked that this is correct , although we have not included a plot showing this explicitly .",
    "=    . [ resid ]    =    =    =    there is an interesting correlation between the residuals of the faber  jackson and @xmath97 relations . at fixed luminosity , galaxies which are larger than the mean @xmath98 tend to have smaller velocity dispersions",
    "this is shown in figure  [ resid ] , which plots the residuals from the @xmath91 relation versus the residuals from the @xmath97 relation .",
    "the short dashed lines show the forward and inverse fits to this scatter plot . the long - dashed line in between the other two shows @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the residual from the mean relation at fixed @xmath57 , and @xmath101 denotes the rms of this residual .",
    "the anti - correlation is approximately the same for all @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that a plot of @xmath1 versus some combination of @xmath2 and @xmath4 should have considerably less scatter than either of the two individual relations .",
    "to illustrate , figure  [ lmass ] shows the distribution of the combination @xmath102 at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the scatter in @xmath1 is significantly reduced , making the mean trend of increasing @xmath102 with increasing @xmath1 quite clean .",
    "( the combination of observables for which the scatter is minimized is discussed in section  [ prjct ] . ) this particular combination defines an effective mass : @xmath103 . in slightly more convenient units ,",
    "this mass is @xmath104 ( because many of our galaxies are not spherical , some of their support must come from rotation , and so ignoring rotation as we are doing is likely to mis - estimate the true mass . see bender , burstein & faber 1992 for one way to account for this .",
    "this quantity will also mis - estimate the mass if some of the support comes from anisotropic velocity dispersions . )",
    "fiducial values of the effective mass - to - light ratio can be obtained by inserting the maximum likelihood values from table  [ mlcov ] into this relation .",
    "this yields @xmath105 ( we used the parameters for the @xmath8 band , for which @xmath106 ) .",
    "the corresponding total absolute magnitude is @xmath107 .",
    "the luminosity of the sun in @xmath8 is @xmath108  mags , so @xmath109 .",
    "the luminosity within the effective radius is half this value , so that the effective mass - to - light ratio within the effective radius of an @xmath110 object is @xmath111 times that of the sun .",
    "figure  [ lmass ] shows that the effective mass - to - light ratio depends on luminosity : @xmath112 at larger radii , the luminosity can double at most , whereas , if the galaxy is embedded in a dark matter halo , the mass at large radii may continue to increase .",
    "for this reason one might expect the mass - to - light ratios to be significantly larger at larger radii .    since the ratio @xmath113 above is the mass - to - light ratio at the radius which encloses half the light , it is tempting to associate it with the mass - to - light ratio at the half mass radius . because both the numerator and the denominator are projected quantities ,",
    "this is incorrect .",
    "for example , if the mass - to - light ratio is independent of distance from the galaxy center , then the three dimensional half - mass radius is about 30% larger than the projected half - light radius ( e.g. hernquist 1990 ) . if the velocity dispersion does not change substantially over the range in radii which contribute light ,",
    "then a fairer estimate of the mass - to - light ratio within the half - mass radius would be about 30% larger than the value given above .",
    "we can define an effective density by setting @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , then @xmath116 figure  [ lden ] shows that this effective density decreases with increasing luminosity , although the scatter in densities at fixed luminosity is quite large ( @xmath117  dex ) . inserting mean values for @xmath4 and @xmath2 yields @xmath118 such a trend is qualitatively similar to that seen in numerical simulations of dissipationless gravitational clustering : the central densities of virialized halos in such simulations are smaller in the more massive halos ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ lmu ] shows a final relation at fixed luminosity : the surface - brightness@xmath119 relation .",
    "in such a plot , luminosity evolution moves objects upwards and to the right ( larger luminosities and surface brightnesses at high redshift ) , so that the higher redshift population should be obviously displaced from the zero - redshift relation .",
    "the plot shows the distribution of @xmath120 and @xmath57 after subtracting the maximum likelihood estimate of the evolution from both quantities .",
    "the solid line shows the maximum likelihood value of the slope of this relation .",
    "this differs slightly from the @xmath121 scaling sandage & perelmuter ( 1990 ) find for giant galaxies with @xmath122 , although the scatter around the mean relation of @xmath123 mags is similar .",
    "this relation is considerably broader than any of the others we have studied so far , which may account for some of the difference .",
    "however , a careful inspection of the figure suggests that the relation is becoming shallower at high redshift ; whether or not this is a signature of differential evolution in the luminosities is the subject of work in progress .",
    "[ ml3d ] section  [ lf ] showed that , after accounting for the fact that the sdss sample is magnitude - limited , the distribution of @xmath78 is quite well described by a gaussian . in principle , by extending the efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( 1988 ) method ( along the lines described by sodr & lahav 1993 ) we could derive non - parametric maximum - likelihood estimates of the three - dimensional distribution of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that it accounts for the fact that the observed sample is magnitude - limited , that there is also a cut at small velocity dispersions , and that there are correlated measurement errors associated with the luminosities , sizes and velocity dispersions .",
    "once the shape of the three - dimensional distribution has been estimated , it is straightforward to obtain estimates of the various correlations with luminosity we studied in the previous section .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ fixedl ] .",
    "however , the real benefit of the maximum likelihood analysis is that it also yields estimates of correlations between observables which do not include luminosity  some examples of these are shown in section  [ others ] .",
    "we chose not to make a non - parametric estimate of the joint distribution because just ten bins in each of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 yields @xmath124 free parameters to be determined from @xmath125 galaxies .",
    "moreover , section  [ lx ] showed that , in each of the sdss wavebands , the distributions of @xmath80 and @xmath87 at fixed absolute magnitude are quite well described by gaussian forms .",
    "therefore , the joint distribution of early - type galaxy luminosities , sizes , and velocity dispersions should be well described by a tri - variate gaussian distribution in the variables @xmath78 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "saglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) describe a maximum likelihood analysis of early - type galaxy correlations in which they _ assume _ that a tri - variate gaussian is a reasonable description of their data : we have the luxury of knowing that this is indeed a reasonable description of our dataset .",
    "thus , we have a simple parametrization of the joint distribution for which , in each waveband , nine numbers suffice to describe the statistical properties of our sample : three mean values , @xmath55 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , three dispersions , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and three pairwise correlations , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "in addition , we will also allow for the possibility that the luminosities are evolving  a tenth parameter to be estimated from the sample .",

    "the distribution of apparent magnitudes , angular sizes , and velocity dispersions in the magnitude limited simulations are very similar to those in the real data .",
    "the simulated parameters also show the same correlations at fixed luminosity as the data",
    ". maximum likelihood analysis on the simulations produces an estimate of the covariance matrix which is similar to that of the data .",
    "therefore , we are confident that our simulated complete catalogs have correlations between luminosity , size , and velocity dispersion which are similar to the data .",
    "our parent sample is magnitude limited ; unless accounted for , this will introduce a bias into a number of correlations we study in this series of papers . for this reason",
    ", we often present results measured in a few volume limited subsamples . because of the cuts at both the faint and the bright ends of the catalog , each volume - limited subsample used in the main text spans only a small range in luminosity .",
    "however , because the galaxies in our sample luminosity show little or no evolution relative to the values at the median redshift of the sample , we can extend this range in either of three ways .",
    "one method is to construct a composite volume - limited catalog by stacking together smaller volume - limited subsamples which are adjacent in redshift and in luminosity , but which do not overlap at all .",
    "let @xmath285 denote the volume of the @xmath42th subsample , and let @xmath286 denote the number of galaxies in it .",
    "a conservative approach is to randomly choose the galaxies in @xmath285 with probability proportional to min@xmath287 , where min@xmath288 denotes the volume of the smallest of the subsamples .",
    "this has the disadvantage of removing much of the data , but , because our data set is so large , we can afford this luxury .",
    "a more cavalier approach is to choose all the galaxies in the largest @xmath285 , all the galaxies in the other @xmath289 , and to generate a set of additional galaxies by randomly choosing one of the @xmath290 galaxies in @xmath289 , adding to each of its observed parameters a gaussian random variate with dispersion given by the quoted observational error , and repeating this @xmath291 $ ] times .",
    "a final possibility is to weight all the galaxies in @xmath285 ( even those which were not in the volume limited subsample ) by the inverse of the volume in which they could have been observed @xmath292 .",
    "we chose the first , most conservative option .    by piecing together three volume limited subsamples",
    ", we were able to construct composite catalogs of about @xmath124 objects each . because the completeness limits are different in the different bands , the composite catalogs are different for each band .",
    "in addition , because any one composite catalog is got by subsampling the set of eligible galaxies , by subsampling many times , we can generate many realizations of a composite catalog .",
    "this allows us to estimate the effects of sample variance on the various correlations we measure ."
