    "an ` index theory ' for non - fredholm operators was commenced some time ago by r. w. carey and j. pincus in @xcite , and f. gesztesy and b. simon in @xcite . in both of these papers",
    "the index is expressed in terms of the krein spectral shift function from scattering theory . in the former paper",
    "the starting point is an operator @xmath0 on a separable hilbert space @xmath7 with the property that the commutator @xmath2 is trace class . in the latter paper",
    "the problem is stated for unbounded operators motivated by examples in @xcite .",
    "the passage from the unbounded picture to the bounded one is straightforward and is explained below ( see also our companion paper @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the main point of the companion paper @xcite was to demonstrate the existence of a class of non - trivial examples to which the general framework described here applies .",
    "these examples are euclidean dirac type operators on @xmath3 .",
    "they illustrate the appropriate generalisation of the carey - pincus framework to the case where one replaces the trace ideal by other schatten ideals .",
    "the primary purpose of the discussion below is to explain , for the bounded picture , a homological formulation of an index theory for non - fredholm operators where we impose a modification of the carey - pincus trace class commutator condition .",
    "this also entails a discussion of the invariance properties of our homological index .",
    "we then provide conditions on perturbations under which the homological index for unbounded operators is unchanged .",
    "there is a relationship to the perturbation invariance result that appears in @xcite .",
    "our conditions apply to the examples in @xcite .",
    "there we observed that the trace class commutator condition of carey - pincus is relevant to low dimensional manifolds but does not apply in higher dimensions .",
    "there is more than one way to generalise the carey - pincus theory .",
    "we believe that the homological development that we provide here is natural from the point of view of the examples in higher dimensions described in @xcite .",
    "the index studied in @xcite , and @xcite is not invariant under compact perturbations and hence has no relationship to k - theory . in this paper",
    "we show how to use cyclic homology as a substitute for k - theory in the sense of expressing the numerical index as the outcome of a pairing of cohomology and homology theories .",
    "specifically , we define our ` homological index ' as a functional on homology groups of a bicomplex for the algebra generated by @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "this bicomplex uses a relative homology construction and is adapted from the usual @xmath8 complex of cyclic theory @xcite .",
    "our main theorem establishes the homotopy invariance , in the sense of cyclic homology , of our homological index .",
    "this enables us to then understand which perturbations of the dirac type operators in @xcite leave the index introduced there invariant .",
    "our generalisation of the carey - pincus work begins with a bounded operator @xmath0 on @xmath7 such that @xmath9 is in the trace class . for @xmath10",
    "this condition reduces to the trace class commutator condition .",
    "for @xmath11 we have :    [ suklemma ] if @xmath4 is trace class then @xmath0 and @xmath6 commute modulo the schatten class @xmath12 .",
    "this result is a corollary of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 16 ) .",
    "the converse to lemma [ suklemma ] appears to require additional side conditions .",
    "our next step is to introduce certain homology groups of the * -algebra generated by @xmath0 .",
    "we present this homological approach in a more abstract framework where we are given an algebra @xmath13 with two ideals @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "later @xmath15 is chosen to be the ideal generated by @xmath17 while @xmath14 is the smallest ideal containing @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "our innovation in this paper is to introduce a bicomplex for the algebra @xmath13 by using the ideals @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the homology theory of our bicomplex has a dual cohomology theory and the pairing between the two , in the concrete situation of operators on hilbert space , produces the real number @xmath20 that we call the homological index .",
    "we then establish the homotopy invariance of this pairing in the sense of cyclic homology .",
    "the second part of the paper applies this theory to some examples of unbounded operators that can be mapped to a pair @xmath21 satisfying a schatten class condition as above .",
    "these examples are of two types .",
    "the first is motivated by @xcite where one starts from a spectral flow problem , and then using the usual doubling trick constructs a @xmath22 graded space and an associated ` index problem ' .",
    "this index problem can be mapped to the bounded picture producing a pair @xmath23 as above .",
    "a second source of examples is studied in @xcite .",
    "they arise from taking a dirac operator acting on @xmath24-sections of the spin bundle over @xmath25 and coupling it to a connection .",
    "if we write this operator as @xmath26 then we pass to the bounded picture using the map @xmath27 . using the natural grading on the @xmath24 sections afforded by the clifford algebra we can construct a pair of operators @xmath21 that satisfy the schatten class condition above .    by scaling @xmath26 ,",
    "that is , replacing it by @xmath28 we obtain a one parameter family of pairs @xmath29 . in @xcite",
    "we studied the scaling limit as @xmath30 of the homological index @xmath31 this limit is referred to as the ` anomaly ' in the mathematical physics literature . on the other hand",
    "we remark that it is the scaling limit as @xmath32 that is studied in @xcite and which motivated much of the subsequent work .",
    "the unbounded operators we consider in @xcite and which arise in other contexts such as @xcite have the following structure .",
    "first we double our hilbert space setting @xmath33 .",
    "we let @xmath34 be a closed densely defined operator on @xmath1 and form the odd selfadjoint operator @xmath35 , where @xmath36",
    ". we will study a class of perturbations of @xmath37 of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an unbounded closed operator on @xmath1 ( generally satisfying some side conditions so that the following manipulations are valid ) and @xmath40 .",
    "the connection to the homological index is via the mapping to bounded operators using the riesz map @xmath41 these bounded operators generate an algebra to which our homological theory applies . to see how this arises we note the identities @xmath42 and @xmath43 we show in @xcite that there is a natural class of dirac - type operators on @xmath25 , @xmath44 which fit the above framework and satisfy the extra condition : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the ideal of trace class operators .",
    "the connection between the dimension of the underlying space @xmath25 and the condition is not evident in the earlier work @xcite but is natural from the point of view of spectral and noncommutative geometry .- algebra generated by @xmath47 that is being investigated by spectral methods here .",
    "the reader may recall from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* introduction to chapter iii ) that the early work of carey - pincus provided inspiration for the initial development of noncommutative geometry .",
    "this paper shows that the later work of @xcite points to a new direction that exploits other tools from noncommutative geometry . ]",
    "the paper begins , in section [ s : precycthe ] , with an outline of the relevant notions from cyclic theory and an explanation of the construction of the bicomplex needed for the homological index . in section",
    "[ s : seqcyc ] we show how the operators of interest in the definition of the homological index form part of a 2-cycle in this bicomplex .",
    "then in section [ s : tracoc ] we show that the homological index coincides with the numerical pairing of our homology theory with its dual .",
    "section [ s : invarpro ] contains our topological invariance results in the form of theorems [ t : hominv ] and [ t : hominvii ] .",
    "the latter in particular investigates when a pair @xmath48 that are joined by a norm differentiable path @xmath49\\}$ ] of operators have the same homological index .",
    "we formulate the conditions in terms of trace norm continuity properties of certain functions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 and their derivatives .",
    "the interesting examples of the homological index arise from differential operators .",
    "so we begin with unbounded operators @xmath34 and the auxiliary structure described in the previous subsection . in section [",
    "s : homindunb ] we define the homological index of these unbounded operators . in section [ s : exiunbhom ]",
    "we work in the framework of subsection [ ss : forunbope ] and show , under certain constraints on the perturbation @xmath39 , that the homological index exists for @xmath34 exists if and only if it exists for the perturbation @xmath52 .",
    "finally in section [ s : invunbhom ] we establish conditions under which the homological indices of @xmath34 and @xmath52 are the same . in the first appendix we sketch how the theorem of section [ s : invunbhom ] applies to the dirac type operators introduced in @xcite . in the second appendix",
    "we have gathered some general results on perturbations of unbounded operators .",
    "in this section we collect the concepts from cyclic theory needed for the paper . throughout this section",
    "@xmath53 will be a unital algebra over the complex numbers .",

    "<S> r. w. carey and j. pincus in @xcite proposed an index theory for non - fredholm bounded operators @xmath0 on a separable hilbert space @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is in the trace class . </S>",
    "<S> we showed in @xcite using dirac - type operators acting on sections of bundles over @xmath3 that we could construct bounded operators @xmath0 satisfying the more general condition that @xmath4 is trace class . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed there a ` homological index ' for these dirac - type operators given by @xmath5 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the index introduced in @xcite represents the result of a paring between a cyclic homology theory for the algebra generated by @xmath0 and @xmath6 and its dual cohomology theory . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to establish the homotopy invariance of our homological index ( in the sense of cyclic theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are then able to define in a very general fashion a homological index for certain unbounded operators and prove invariance of this index under a class of unbounded perturbations . </S>"
