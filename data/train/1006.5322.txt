    "new results are presented on prompt photon production in photoproduction @xcite and deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the data arise from 320 to @xmath2 of hera - ii collisions , including both @xmath3 and @xmath4 data sets these are used to test the predictions of various theories with collinear factorisation or @xmath0-factorisation .",
    "the comparison at low @xmath5 and low @xmath6 tends to favour the @xmath0-factorisation approach .",
    "high-@xmath7 isolated photon emission offers a new and reliable probe of dynamics in @xmath8-proton collisions .",
    "the photon is the only stable final state particle that couples to the quark line in the feynman diagram .",
    "for this reason theorists refer to it as a ` prompt ' photon ( not coming from hadron decay ) .",
    "experimentally one observes ` isolated ' signals in the detector .",
    "in dis events there are two hard scales , the @xmath5 of the exchanged photon and the @xmath7 of the observed photon .",
    "the observed photon can be radiated from a quark line ( refered to as the qq process ) or the lepton line ( ll process ) .",
    "the interference term ( lq process ) is small for isolated photons and also changes sign between @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the lq term is therefore neglected in this work and @xmath3 and @xmath4 data sets are combined .",
    "note that in the ll process the electron recoils against the high-@xmath7 photon into the detector acceptance and the event is therefore classified as dis . as a result",
    "the prompt - photon photoproduction data set contains only the qq process . in this case",
    "the feynman diagram can involve direct exchanged photons ( coupling via the process @xmath9 ) or resolved exchanged photons , which couple to gluons in the proton via the process @xmath10 . )    two stages are involved in extracting the isolated - photon signal .",
    "first the final - state electron is removed and the remaining calorimeter energy - flow objects ( efos ) are clustered into jets , using the inclusive-@xmath0 algorithm with parameter @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "one then looks at the ratio @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy of the electromagnetic - calorimeter efo , and @xmath14 is the energy of the jet that includes the electromagnetic cluster . demanding @xmath15 eliminates a large fragmentation - dominated background .",
    "( the signal lies predominantly at @xmath16 . )",
    "-width distribution ]    [ fig1 ]    the isolated electromagnetic efo thus identified is dominated by unresolved clusters of two or more photons , mainly from @xmath17 decay , which has a minimum opening angle given by @xmath18 , giving a typical separation of a few cm in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "one therefore needs to extract a narrow - efo signal for isolated single photons .",
    "h1 use a discriminant method based on six shower - shape variables - transverse radius , symmetry and kurtosis , first layer energy fraction , hot core fraction and hottest cell fraction .",
    "the zeus work reported here uses the fine - granularity projective geometry of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter to distinguish @xmath19 and @xmath20 peaks .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the distribution in @xmath21 .",
    "the fit is discussed below .",
    "r84 mm        [ fig2 ]",
    "h1 present results on inclusive @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the kinematic range as follows . for the photon @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath15 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and for jets @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "they compare their results to nlo qcd .",
    "fontannaz , guillet and heinrich ( fgh ) use collinear factorisation and dglap evolution , include ( @xmath30 ) and some higher terms and use mrst01 and afg2 pdf s for @xmath31 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "h1 also compare their results to a @xmath0-factorisation calculation due to lipatov and zotov ( lz ) @xcite which uses direct and resolved integrated parton densities . in comparing the @xmath23 data",
    "to theory hadronisation corrections ( estimated using pythia ) are of order @xmath32 .",
    "figure 2 includes the transverse energy and pseudorapidity distributions for the @xmath33 final state compared to predictions .",
    "there is some tendency for the photon rapidity to favour lz .",
    "this is also seen in earlier zeus results @xcite .",
    "h1 separate the photon - plus - jet data into direct and resolved exchanged photons using photon and jet directions and the photon energy , ( high and low values of @xmath34 ) , and use these data sets to study azimuthal photon - jet correlations . in figure",
    "2 @xmath35 is the difference in their azimuth angles and @xmath36 is the momentum in the transverse plane that , if added to the photon , would make its azimuth angle opposite to the jet .",
    "none of the theories describes these data well .",
    "additional higher - order  theory terms could improve the agreement .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the zeus isolated photon candidates fitted as the sum of ll and qq events , and hadronic background predicted by monte carlo . in this fit",
    "the purely leptonic events are assumed to be accurately calculated and the normalisation is held fixed , as is the hadronic background .",
    "one then needs to rescale the monte carlo qq prediction by 1.6 to obtain the required number of events .",
    "this factor was then held fixed in the bin - by - bin signal extraction .",
    "( for practical reasons the monte carlo s used were pythia6.416 for qq and django6- heracles4.8.6-ariadne for ll and the hadronic background @xcite .",
    ") figure [ fig4 ] shows the data distributions for photon @xmath7 , @xmath37 , and for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the photon kinematic range is @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath15 , and @xmath40 ( measured using the outgoing electron , which must have energy above 10  gev and lie in the angular range @xmath41 to @xmath42 . )",
    "a cut on the final state hadronic mass to be above 5  gev excludes dvcs events .",
    "the monte carlo predictions ( not shown ) describe @xmath7 and @xmath37 well , but fall below the data at low @xmath6 and at low @xmath5 .",
    "the results in figure [ fig4 ] are compared to a number of theoretical predictions .",
    "ggp is the state - of - the - art @xmath43 collinear factorisation prediction @xcite .",
    "the production of photons by jet fragmentation is included but is suppressed by the isolation cuts .",
    "mrst calculate @xmath44 collisions where the @xmath22 is part of the photon structure @xcite .",
    "this can be thought of as the ll process with radiative corrections to all orders .",
    "we therefore show also a prediction for ggp : qq+mrst .",
    "this gives a reasonable description of the data except at low @xmath5 and at low @xmath6 .",
    "results on @xmath45 show the same behaviour @xcite .",
    "baranov , lipatov and zotov have calculated inclusive prompt photon production using the @xmath0-factorisation approach ( @xmath46 ) @xcite . compared to collinear factorisation",
    ", this is expected the increase the cross - section at low @xmath5 and low @xmath6 .",
    "the agreement with the data in figure [ fig5 ] is impressive compared to figure 3 .",
