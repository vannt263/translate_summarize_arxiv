    "pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pmn ) is one of the earliest members of the growing family of lead ferroelectric relaxors , which , due to its application potential , has been attracting attention of researchers for many years .",
    "however , despite significant efforts , many properties of lead compounds are still unclear and the very nature of the relaxor behavior has yet to be understood .",
    "the difficulties stem from the high complexity of these materials with a high degree of compositional , chemical and structural disorder .",
    "pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 has a perovskite structure with , on average , a cubic pm3 m symmetry , with mg@xmath3 and nb@xmath4 ions interchanging on b sites .",
    "measurements of the dielectric constant show that the crystal does not undergo a sharp transition to a ferroelectric phase .",
    "instead , the dielectric constant exhibits a broad maximum at t@xmath5  k@xcite .",
    "below t@xmath6  k , it deviates from curie - weiss law@xcite and , at t@xmath7350  k , exhibits strong dispersion@xcite .",
    "the structure of pmn is not homogeneous .",
    "if mg and nb occupation ratio were uniformly and ideally equal 1:2 throughout the crystal , it would have a rhombohedral symmetry r3 m .",
    "but , a network of superstructure clusters with face centered cubic symmetry ( fm3 m ) , destroys the picture .",
    "the size of these clusters is of the order of 2 - 3 nm ; the distance between the centers of the neighboring clusters is near 2.5  nmboulesteix , harmer .",
    "the most widely accepted hypothesis , so - called space - charge model , associates these fm3 m clusters with antiferroelectrically ordered@xcite areas where mg : nb occupation ratio is equal to 1:1 , i.e. with local composition pb(mg@xmath8nb@xmath9)o@xmath2@xcite .",
    "such 1:1 clusters carry an excessive negative charge , which is compensated by the positively charged host matrix .",
    "network of these charges acts as a source of random fields and may prevent the occurrence of the normal  phase transition .",
    "alternatively , the fm3 m clusters might be explained by the local order in the form of pb[b@xmath10b@xmath11@xmath9[b@xmath4]@xmath9o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis avoids assumption of the considerable space charges and calls for other reasons to explain relaxor behavior , including the random fields due to the disorder - induced local anisotropy@xcite , effects related to different ionic radii@xcite or both@xcite .",
    "the presence of areas with special order causes crystalline structure to change in an intricate way . at the high temperature limit",
    ", the crystal has a uniform primitive cubic ( pm3 m ) structure .",
    "lowering the temperature leads to distinguishability between mg@xmath3 and nb@xmath4 sites and to formation in the ordered regions of a face centered ( fm3 m ) superstructure .",
    "the temperature of the fm3 m clusters formation has yet to be determined .",

    "these distortions are responsible for the deviation of the dielectric constant from curie - weiss law at t@xmath22@xcite .",
    "their presence also causes a non - linearity in the temperature dependence of the optical refraction index@xcite .",
    "size of the pnr s is equal to 30 - 80   depending on temperature@xcite .",
    "the appearance of polar distortions is a consequence of the ion off - centering that is a common property of many perovskites . by structural similarity",
    ", one could expect that the mechanism of the polar regions formation in pmn is analogous to the one in kta@xmath23nb@xmath24o@xmath2 ( ktn)@xcite .",
    "however , unlike ktn where nb@xmath4 is the only off - centered positive ion , pmn represents a more difficult case . here , not only _ both ions of b - type _ ,",
    "mg@xmath3 and nb@xmath4 , are shifted by @xmath130.1 - 0.2   , but also pb@xmath3 , _ ion of a - type _ , is off - centered by @xmath130.25 - 0.35  @xcite .",
    "the b - ions tend to shift along a ( 111 ) direction , thus having eight equivalent positions .",
    "the shifts of the pb@xmath3-ions exhibit a spherically symmetric distributionvakhrushev .",
    "it is often assumed@xcite that nb@xmath4 , due to its position in the cell and small radius , acts as the main ferroelectric agent .    at high temperature ,",
    "the off - centered ions are free to reorient among all allowed off - centered positions . cooling down and the growing role of the electric interactions causes the appearance of correlated regions consisting of several neighboring cells .",
    "each such region is characterized by a giant electric dipole moment and a local distortion from the cubic symmetry .",
    "the pnr s are capable of reorientational motion as whole units . in ktn ,",
    "the development of these regions leads , at some critical temperature , to a phase transition .",
    "however , in pmn , the polar regions develop under constraints imposed by the local anisotropy . as a result , no ferroelectric phase transition , but a glasslike freezing of the polar regions is observed@xcite . a bias electric field of magnitude @xmath25  kv / cm , applied in the ( 111 ) direction , is sufficient to compensate for the influence of the frustrating effects and to induce , at t@xmath26  k , a transition to the rhombohedral r3 m ferroelectric phase@xcite .",
    "raman spectra of pmn have been measured and reported by several research groups@xcite .",
    "but , the high complexity of the processes caused difficulties in their interpretation , especially due to possible coexistence of clusters with pm3 m , fm3 m and r3 m symmetry .",
    "it has been shown that the major spectral lines are of first - order character@xcite . in cubic crystals first - order raman scattering",
    "is prohibited by symmetry .",
    "explanation of the appearance of first - order scattering _ in principle _ is the one side of the problem .",
    "another side is the assignment of _ particular _ lines .",
    "the question of the soft ferroelectric mode ( to@xmath15 ) and the strong raman line at @xmath1345  @xmath14 , which is close to where the to@xmath15 is expected to be found ,  has been like a stumbling block for investigators .",
    "interpretations of the pmn  raman spectrum offered by various research groups are summarized in table [ ramanconc ] .",
    "this table reflects the variety of mutually excluding opinions ranging from those that explain the light scattering by _ disorder in general _ ( groups of hussonhusson , krainik@xcite , marssi@xcite , dujovne@xcite ) to those that connect it to the presence of some _ particular type of disorder _ , the one that can lead to the appearance of clusters with symmetry allowing first - order scattering , like face centered cubic ( jiang@xcite , lushnikov@xcite , sinysinymrs , sinyjrs , sinyf - a , sinyf - b , sinyf - rev ) , rhombohedral  ( idinkidink ) or tetragonal ( dimza@xcite ) .",
    "the assignement of particular lines is even more contradictory .",
    "recently made first - principle calculations @xcite can confirm only few of them .",
    "we believe , the arguments might be resolved by taking into account the possibility of coexistence of different mechanisms , each playing a role in the scattering processes .",
    "recently published low branches of phonon dispersion curvesgehwak , wakstock , gehvak , nabervak , measured by neutron scattering , must be helpful for the phonon assignment of some of the raman lines . according to these data",
    ", the strong 45  @xmath14 line has an energy close to the energy of the zone center ( zc ) to@xmath15 or the zone boundary ( zb ) ta phonon .",
    "lowering the temperature , to@xmath15 zone center phonon exhibits softening , at t@xmath27t@xmath22  k , due to the drastic increase of damping , it disappears .",
    "the overdamping continues down to t@xmath28  k@xcite .",
    "it also causes significant , almost sixfold , broadening of the ta phonon branch@xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that the raman line at 45  @xmath29 is also affected by the described phenomenon .",
    "however , none of the known raman reports show any significant effects that could be attributed to this overdamping .",
    "the formation of the lower - symmetry clusters in the host crystal is accompanied by relaxational and reorientational dynamics .",
    "this dynamics should be reflected in the light scattering spectrum either directly or through interaction with the phonon modes .",
    "theoretical considerations@xcite show that internal relaxational motion leads to the appearance of the central peak ( cp ) in the raman spectrum .",
    "interactions of this motion with phonons can cause softening of them@xcite .",
    "these predictions have been tested on several types of crystals with internal degrees of freedom , like alkali - halide - cyanide ( k(cn)@xmath24-kbr@xmath23 , k(cn)@xmath24-kcl@xmath23)rowea , roweb , lutya , lutyb compounds .",
    "recently , we have analyzed@xcite the reorientational motion in ferroelectric kta@xmath23nb@xmath24o@xmath30 crystals . in this paper",
    "we discuss the role of the relaxational and reorientational dynamics in the scattering processes from pmn crystal .    in the paper",
    "presented we offer a complex analysis of temperature dependencies of polarized ( vv ) and depolarized ( vh ) raman spectra from a single crystalline pmn sample .",
    "this analysis is based on multiple peak decomposition .",
    "an attempt to apply similar kind of analysis has earlier been made by siny et al.@xcite .",
    "but , it was restricted to the low frequency vv spectra in a limited temperature range ( with maximum temperature @xmath13620  k ) , concentrating on the central peak ( cp ) only . to obtain the complete picture",
    ", we consider the temperature evolution of the whole raman scattering spectrum ( up to 1000  @xmath14 ) in the 100 - 1000  k temperature range .",
    "we interpret our results in connection with recently published neutron scattering data and with the concept of interaction of phonons with internal relaxational motion . as a result of this work",
    ", we present our view on the picture of structural transformations in pmn crystal and on the origin of its raman spectrum .",
    "we have investigated the raman scattering from @xmath31 cut pmn  single crystal .",
    "the crystal was grown by the high temperature solution technique using 30  wt% pbo as flux .",
    "the growth conditions were optimized based on the pseudo - binary phase diagram established for pmn and pbo@xcite . the as - grown crystal exhibits a pseudo - cubic morphology with @xmath32 cub growth steps .",
    "a @xmath33 cub - oriented crystal of a volume of 53  mm@xmath34 was cut from a large as - grown crystal and polished with fine diamond paste ( down to 0.25  mm ) .",
    "it showed very high optical quality and satisfied the requirements for light scattering studies .",
    "the scattering was excited by propagating in @xmath31 direction 514.5  nm light from a 200  mw ar@xmath35-ion laser , focused to a 0.1  mm spot .",
    "the scattered light was collected at an angle of 90@xmath36 with respect to the incident beam ( i.e. , in @xmath37 direction ) by a double - grating isa jobin yvon spectrometer equipped with a hamamatsu photomultiplier r-649 . for most of the measurements ,",
    "the slits were opened to 1.7  @xmath14 . however , in order to acquire more precise data in the central peak region , at the temperatures close to the maximum of the dielectric constant ( @xmath38  k ) , the slits were narrowed to 0.5  @xmath14 .",
    "each polarization of the scattered light , @xmath39 ( vv ) and @xmath40 ( vh ) , was measured separately . in order to exclude differences in sensitivity of the monochromator to different polarizations of the light ,",
    "a circular polarizer was used in front of the entrance slit . for control purposes",
    ", we also took measurements without polarization analysis .",
    "finally , to protect the photomultiplier from the strong raleigh scattering , the spectral region from -4 to + 4  @xmath14 was excluded from the scans .",
    "the data were collected in the temperature range from 1000 to 100  k. the cooling rate was 0.5 - 1  k / min . every 50 - 20  k the temperature was stabilized and the spectrum recorded .",
    "we agree with ref.@xcite that the reproducibility of the spectra in the temperature range approximately between 200 and 350  k was not very good . in this range ,",
    "the spectra exhibited a strong dependence on the cooling rate and other experimental conditions .",
    "fig.[cascade ] presents examples of light scattering spectra measured at different temperatures without polarization analysis . to facilitate comparison",
    ", we corrected the spectra by the bose population factor :    @xmath41    where @xmath42    figure [ vv - vh ] demonstrates scattering spectra measured in vv ( a ) and vh ( b ) geometries at different temperatures .",
    "these spectra we present in uncorrected , `` as - measured '' , form .        as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ cascade ] and [ vv - vh ] , our spectra are consistent with those from refs.@xcite and @xcite . in the high temperature region ,",
    "a typical spectrum consists of two strong lines centered approximately at 45  @xmath14 and 780  @xmath14 ( labelled a and b ) and of three broad bands ( c , d , e ) .",
    "line a exhibits fine structure , which is explicitly seen on the spectra measured with polarization analysis ( see figs .",
    "[ vv - vh ] and [ fitexamples ] ) .",
    "lowering temperature leads to the splitting of the broad bands c , d and e into a number of narrower lines ( labelled by indices ) and to appearance of new line f.    as seen from fig .",
    "[ cascade ] , starting from 1000  k , the reduced intensity of the scattering , first grows until the temperature of @xmath43  k then sharply decreases to a minimum located close to the burns temperature t@xmath44  k , after which it increases again . at @xmath45",
    "k its strength gets restored .",
    "below this temperature , the intensities of the major lines ( especially a and b ) are determined primarely by the bose factor .",
    "i.e. being corrected by it , they do not show significant temperature changes , demonstrating characteristic first - order behavior .",
    "the shape similarity of the low- and high- temperature spectra shows that even at 1000  k the scattering has first - order character . in the perfecly cubic crystal ,",
    "first - order scattering is prohibited .",
    "therefore , one should assume the presence of distortions in the form of lower symmetry clusters , like fm3 m or r3 m .",
    "at high temperature , these clusters might be present in the dynamic form , having short lifetime .",
    "lowering the temperature , their lifetime increases and they become progressively more static .",
    "the observed around t@xmath22 decrease of raman intensity is also clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ vv - vh ] .",
    "however , there are no reports on this effect in the literature ; it might have been overlooked .",
    "this intensity drop indicates worsening of the optical quality of the crystal . in our opinion",
    ", it is consistent with the formation of fm3 m clusters in their evolution from dynamic to static form .",
    "the splitting of peaks is associated with the development of r3 m clusters .",
    "the first signs of the splitting appear at t@xmath22 .",
    "strarting from t@xmath46  k ( which is also close to where the dispersion of the dielectric constant appears ) , this effect becomes even more definite and the intensities of the components begin to grow .",
    "below t@xmath28  k , which is the temperature of electric field - induced ferroelectric phase transition@xcite , the shape of the spectra is relatively stable .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of our data and their comparison with results of other experiments allows to understand the meaning of the mentioned above temperatures t@xmath44  k , t@xmath47  k and t@xmath48  k in the temperature evolution of the raman spectra and the lattice structure .",
    "to be able to analyze the data , we decomposed the measured spectra using multiple peak fitting procedure .",
    "it was found that satisfactory fit could be achieved with the assumption that the central peak has a lorentzian shape and that each of the other peaks is described by the spectral response function , i.e. damped harmonic oscillator , modified by the population factor ( [ boze ] ) :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the damping constant and the mode frequency .",
    "as all of the peaks are much better resolved at low temperatures , we started our fitting procedure at the low - temperature end of the data set ( at 110  k ) and , then , observed the evolution of the peaks with increasing temperature ( i.e. , in order , opposite to the order of measuring ) . at the same time , we tried to minimize the number of peaks necessary to achieve a reasonably good fit .",
    "the control data set ( measured without polarization analysis ) has been used to calibrate the positions and widths of the weak and poorely resolved peaks from the vv and vh data sets . since a large number of parameters",
    "is involved , results of a particular fit may depend on their initial values .",
    "to stabilize the results , the best - fit values of parameters obtained at the previous temperature were used as initial values for the next one . in this manner ,",
    "several sets of fits were obtained and analyzed .",
    "it is remarkable , that in all of them the major parameters showed the same trends of behavior , confirming the importance of the mentioned above temperatures : t@xmath52  k , t@xmath53  k and t@xmath54  k. these trends are summarized in table [ peakproperties ] .",
    "one of the sets have been selected to report the most interesting results in detail .",
    "examples of the fits at the temperatures of 1000 and 110  k in vv and vh geometries are shown in fig .",
    "[ fitexamples ] . for clarity",
    ", we describe the observed phenomena from high to low temperatures , following the same order as in measurements ( unless the opposite stated ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the temperature dependences of the fitting parameters for the central peak ( cp ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ central ] .",
    "circles correspond to the vv and triangles to the vh component of the peak .",
    "the existence of the cp is a direct consequence of the lattice relaxations , which are very sensitive to the restrictions imposed by the low - symmetry clusters .",
    "if relaxations are fast@xcite , the cp is low - intense and broad , whereas their slowing causes growth and narrowing of the peak .",
    "we would like to point out a striking similarity of the temperature behavior of the cp in pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ central ] ) and in kta@xmath55nb@xmath56o@xmath2 ( fig.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) crystals .",
    "we have shown@xcite that the temperature behavior of the cp in ktn can be explained by the model involving the relaxational motion of off - centered nb ions and its progressive restriction with temperature decrease . in the cubic phase ,",
    "nb ions are allowed to reorient amongst eight equivalent @xmath57111@xmath58 directions .",
    "the appearance of the pnr s followed by a sequence of phase transitions down to a rhombohedral r3 m phase , limits the ion motion to four , two and , finally , locks it in only one site .",
    "this model is in agreement with the diffuse neutron scattering studies of similar system@xcite .",
    "the similarity of the cp behavior in these two very different materials , suggests that the temperature evolution of the polar clusters in pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 passes through the similar stages as in kta@xmath55nb@xmath56o@xmath2 ( ktn ) , however , it is not accompanied by appearance of the long - range order .    starting from the high - temperature end ( fig . [ central ] ) , the first important feature is the strong and narrow scattering in the vv geometry accompanied by a relatively weak scattering in the vh geometry .",
    "this indicates the presence of a symmetric slow relaxational motion , involving 180@xmath59 reorientations of ions .",
    "lowering the temperature , starting from @xmath60  k , a cessation of this motion causes an intensity decrease of the cp .",
    "slow at first , this decrease becomes sharper and reaches minimum near t@xmath44  k. the prohibition of 180@xmath61 reorientations introduces anisotropy into the lattice causing the distinguishability between mg and nb occupied cites and to formation in the 1:1 ordered areas of the superstructure with , on average , fm3 m symmetry .",
    "it also imposes first restrictions on the reorientational motion of the dynamical r3 m polar nanoregions .",
    "now , they can reorient only amongst four neighboring @xmath57111@xmath58 directions , forming , on average , tetragonal - like distortions .",
    "these processes are accompanied by the appearance of large ( of the order of wavelength of light ) dynamic fluctuations causing worsening of the optical quality of the sample .    with further decrease of the temperature , the optical quality of the crystal",
    "improves . from @xmath45",
    "k , the four - cite reorientational motion of the pnr s starts to slow down , which is marked by the narrowing of the vv component of the cp and increase of its vv and vh intensities .",
    "the simultaneous broadening of the vh component up to the maximum at @xmath62  k , indicates rearrangements in the crystalline structure leading to the appearance of the new type of restrictions on the ion motion .",
    "analogy with ktn suggests that below @xmath62  k the motion of r3 m clusters becomes limited to two neigboring @xmath57111@xmath58 orientations , averaging in monoclinic - like distortions .",
    "such a rearrangement causes some decrease in intensity of the vv component ( with minimum at @xmath63  k ) , while the vh intensity keeps growing . below @xmath63",
    "k , the slowing down of the two - site relaxational motion causes narrowing the cp and increase of intensities of both components . from t@xmath47  k ,",
    "these effects become especially dramatic .",
    "further temperature decrease , starting from @xmath64  k , leads to the complete prohibition of intersite reorientational motion of r3 m clusters , i.e. to appearance of static r3 m clusters .",
    "this is marked by a sharp decrease in intensity of both components of the cp .",
    "at the temperature t@xmath48  k , the process of conversion of pnr s from dynamic to static form ( freezing ) is primarily finished .",
    "below this temperature , the central peak is narrow and its intensity is small in both scattering geometries .",
    "we should mention that the result of our analysis of the vv component of the cp exhibits similar tendencies to those in ref.@xcite , except at the low temperature end .",
    "the discrepancy occurs due to the difference in experimental technique . in the central peak region",

    "the lower frequency oscillator can still be associated with disorder - induced scattering on zb ta mode .",
    "the possible explanation of the presence of two vh components in the peak a can be in the correspondence to ta modes with different polarizations in different crystalline planes of a distorted lattice .",
    "( a similar effect we have seen in monodomain kta@xmath23li@xmath24o@xmath2 , where one or the other ta polarization was observed , depending on the orientation of the electric field . ) these differently polarized modes are influenced by the polar nanoregions , which explains the increase of damping ( fig .",
