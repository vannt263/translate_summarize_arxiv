    "the _ alpha magnetic spectrometer _ ( ams )  @xcite is a particle detector that will be installed on the international space station ( iss ) to measure cosmic ray fluxes for at least three years .",
    "the ams goals are the search for cosmic antimatter , the search for dark matter signatures , and the measurement of primary cosmic ray ( cr ) spectra below 1 tev .    in 1998",
    "a first version of the detector ( called ams-01 ) has flown aboard of the space shuttle discovery during the nasa sts-91 mission , and it operated successfully for ten days collecting about hundred million events ( refer to @xcite for a review of the ams-01 results ) . for the iss 3-year mission , a new version of the detector ( called ams-02 , figure  [ ams2 ] ) is being developed .",
    "the new apparatus will consist of a transition radiation detector ( trd ) followed by two of the four scintillator planes of the time of flight ( tof ) system , placed above the superconducting magnet enclosing a silicon tracker surrounded by an anticoincidence ( acc ) system .",
    "below the magnet , the other two planes of the tof are followed by the proximity focusing ring imaging erenkov counter ( rich ) and by the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "the large acceptance of the apparatus ( about 0.4 @xmath2 sr ) and the long duration of the mission ( at least 3 years ) will allow for a detailed study of the spectra of hydrogen and helium isotopes , that can be used to study solar modulation on a weekly basis and to check different cr propagation models .",
    "in addition to very precise measurements of the electrons and positrons spectra , ams will also collect an unprecedented amount of ions events , that are of paramount importance for the fine tuning of the parameters of any propagation model @xcite .",
    "finally , the detector will be able to measure high energy gamma rays up to few hundred gev @xcite .",
    "in order to measure the particle velocity with high accuracy , a erenkov detector is highly desirable .",
    "howewer , the need for a wide geometrical acceptance makes impossible the use of an ordinary ring imaging detector : a proximity focusing technique has to be adopted .",
    "hence the rich subdetector of ams-02 consists of a flat radiator plane , where the erenkov photons are emitted , followed by a gap where these photons propagate in vacuo until they reach the pixel plane , parallel to the radiator ( figure  [ rich ] ) .",
    "the hole in the middle of the pixel plane is exactly above the electromagnetic calorimeter , in order not to have a big amount of matter in front of it .",
    "the basics constituents of the ams-02 rich are the radiator plane , the conical mirror , and the pixel plane with 680 16-channel phototubes ( pmt ) and segmented plastic light guides ( lg ) to decrease the dead area of the pixel plane .",
    "particle mass identification depends on the momentum and velocity resolution of the detector : @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 denotes the sum in quadrature ) .",
    "given the good momentum resolution of the ams-02 tracker , it comes out that particle identification with the rich can be achieved over a range @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the interesting range for constraining the parameters of propagation models is roughly @xmath6 gev / nucl , where the ratio between lithium , beryllium , boron and carbon and the ratio between sub - fe elements and iron are expecially useful to test different models @xcite .",
    "howewer , no single radiator can be used to cover this whole range , hence it is necessary to make a choice . due to the fact that the balloon measurements collected events principally in the lower energy range , the ams collaboration agreed that the rich has to focus on the higher range .    the only solid material with refractive index small enough to allow particle discrimination up to 15 gev/@xmath7 per nucleon is aerogel , that is available with refractive indexes of 1.03 and 1.05 , and has a maximum erenkov angle of about 15 degrees ( figure  [ angles ] ) .",
    "due to the small erenkov angles obtained with aerogel , a fraction of the particles crossing the radiator in the middle and entering the emc hole would not be detected by the rich ( track b in figure  [ miss ] ) .",
    "the collaboration has still the option to put a small tile of naf as central radiator : thanks to the wider emission angle of naf , this would allow for an increase of the effective geometric factor of order 10% .",
    "due to the greater refractive index of sodium fluoride , the number of emitted photons is greater than that of aerogel .",
    "hence the width of the radiator would be different : 3 cm for aerogel tiles , 0.5 cm for the naf core .",
    "the incident angle of charged particles crossing the ams-02 rich radiator has a broad distribution ( roughly 40 degrees wide ) , and many events would produce photons not detectable by the pixel plane .",
    "for this reason , a conical mirror is foreseen , that will increase the acceptance of about 30% .",
    "the mirror construction is quite elaborate : first , a conical aluminum mandrel is done whose external surface is lathe machined down to rms roughness of order 200 nm",
    ". then this surface will be chemically plated with 60 @xmath8 m of nickel and polished again down to about 10 nm rms .",
    "finally the mandrel will serve as the `` negative '' of the mirror , that will be made of a carbon fiber structure 1 mm thick whose internal surface will be plated with aluminum and finally with a protection layer of quartz or manganese fluoride .",
    "while the radiator support structure ( in carbon fiber ) is fixed to the tof mechanics , the mirror and the pixel plane are bound together , with their aluminum mechanics directly attached to the ams-02 support structure .",
    "hence , the vibration tests and the finite element method simulations for the radiator are shared with those of the tof subsystem , while the pixel plane and the mirror have a parallel vibration study .",
    "this effort is necessary to follow all nasa specifications , and ( both for rich and tof ) it is carried on in collaboration with the italian company carlo gavazzi space spa .      the pixel plane of the ams-02 rich consists of 680 multi - channel hamamatsu phototubes derived from model r5900 .",
    "this `` venetian blind '' r7600 - 00-m16 model has the photo - cathode divided into @xmath9 cells , followed by 12 metal channel dynodes and a segmented anode with 16 read - out channels .",
    "the photo - cathode cells are @xmath10 @xmath11 wide and the pmt is roughly a square with @xmath12 mm side and @xmath13 mm body height , with 7 mm pins .",
    "the voltage divider has total impedance 80 m@xmath14  and the repartition ( 2.4 : 2.4 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1.2 : 2.4 : 2.4 ) was chosen in order to achieve a good linearity .",
    "such pmts have a gain of order @xmath15 at voltages in the range @xmath16 v and their pixel cross - talk is usually below 5% .",
    "figure  [ pmt ] shows a picture of the rich phototube assembly : the pmt is enclosed by the black housing , to which the plastic light guides are bound with kevlar wires .",
    "the printed circuit boards below the pmt contain the voltage divider and the anodes read - out circuits , connected to an amplifier .",
    "signals from several pmts are read via a flat cable that is visible in the lowest part of the picture .",
    "finally , half of the enclosing magnetic shielding is shown .",
    "the pmt were tested in magnetic field , with and without magnetic shielding , in order to understand their behavior in the final configuration , and it comes out that the gain will change at most 20% in the worst cases ( with @xmath17 g along the ams @xmath18 direction ) . in particular , the shielding boxes along the @xmath18 direction will have different thickness ( from 6.0 mm to 1.2 mm ) , in order to compensate for collective effects ( figure  [ grid ] ) .",
    "direction is made of boxes of different thickness , increasing toward the middle . ]",
    "a prototype for the rich radiator was built at isn grenoble , and used to test different radiators using cosmic ray and beam particles .",
    "the prototype ( radiator , pixel plane and front - end electronics ) is placed inside a vacuum chamber , to avoid environmental light and to ensure that the refractive index between the radiator and the pixel plane is the same as during the iss operation .",
    "figure [ rich - cr ] shows the setup used for cr runs : the charged particles that cross both scintillators are tracked by three multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) , placed above and below the prototype . for beam runs",
    ", there are only one mwpc and a couple of thin small scintillators in front of the vacuum chamber , in order to minimize the amount of material placed before the detector .",
    "figure [ rich - cr - beta ] shows the @xmath0 resolution for a given cr event , taking into consideration all used pixels ( every hit gives an independent estimate of the erenkov angle ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ ring ] shows the hits configuration for a lithium ion during the beam test carried on at cern during october 2002 . during this test",
    "the pb beam accelerated by the sps was directed on a be target , and the 20 gev / nucl fragments were selected by requiring different values for the ratio @xmath19 . the rich prototype , together with prototypes of the ams-02 tof and tracker , collected more than 10 million events with @xmath20 , 3/2 ( @xmath21 ) , 7/4 ( @xmath22 ) , and 1 ( protons ) , and the data analysis is in progress .          the ams collaboration ( m. aguilar et al . ) , `` the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams ) on the international space station , part i , results from the test flight on the space shuttle '' , physics reports , vol .",
