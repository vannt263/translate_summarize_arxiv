    "this indicates that @xmath53 may be infinite there  we checked that at least @xmath54 type of solution does not exist , where @xmath55 .",

    "the singular solutions are plotted in fig.[fig = dssfd](b ) .",
    "note that in flat spacetime as well as in self - gravitating spacetime without a cosmological constant , there do not exist static configurations above some critical noninteger winding number smaller than one .",
    "however , with a cosmological constant , we have static solutions up to @xmath62 . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the texture completes one winding at the horizon , and for @xmath64 , it does even inside the horizon .",
    "we will see that this is also true for the case including the self - gravity of the texture field in the next section .",
    "this result agrees with the expectation we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "collapse is balanced by the expansion of the background .    for",
    "a given singular configuration inside the horizon , the matching solution outside must exist .",
    "however , as the field equation  ( [ eq = scalards ] ) does not provide any information about the functional form , or specific values of the field derivatives at the horizon , we can not continue numerical calculations to the region outside of the horizon .",
    "considering solutions only inside the horizon is justified as following . when the texture is formed , the scalar field acquires values in the vacuum manifold .",
    "different regions in space take different values of the field .",
    "the correlation length scale within which the region takes the same value , can not exceed the cosmological horizon scale at the moment of formation .",
    "usually the formation of one defect is completed within the cosmological horizon .",
    "other defects are formed in the neighborhood .    in the present case ,",
    "if we include the contribution of other matters ( for example , the texture field itself ) to the energy density of the universe , the cosmological horizon determined by the total energy density is always smaller than the de sitter horizon . therefore , considering solutions only inside the de sitter horizon is perfectly guaranteed .",
    "although singular solutions would be accepted by the above justification , we need to comment some trouble associated with them .",
    "first , if @xmath53 is infinite at the horizon , the curvature diverges . if we include the self - gravity of the texture , the horizon is not only a coordinate singularity , but becomes a curvature singularity . if there is a curvature singularity , the signal emitted from it can propagate to the inner region .",
    "observers off the center of the texture eventually will see the signal .",
    "this trouble may be resolved if we put the causal boundary to the cosmological horizon which is inside the de sitter horizon .",
    "hence , the texture configuration is cut by neighboring textures before it develops a singularity .    as we will see in sec .",
    "v , the static texture configurations are unstable under small perturbations .",
    "the scalar field may evolve in such a way as to remove the singular behavior at the horizon .",
    "in addition , when the field gradient is very large locally , the scalar field acquires enough energy to overcome the potential barrier .",
    "therefore , the nonlinear @xmath36-model approximation is not valid any longer .",
    "even though the solutions obtained here are static inside the horizon , they co - move with the expanding background",
    ". the configuration will be self - similar as time passes unless there are perturbations .",
    "in this section , we include the effect of the texture self - gravity . for textures of gut symmetry - breaking scale , @xmath65 , the effect is very small .",
    "therefore , the results are very similar to those in the previous section .",
    "the location of the horizon is displaced a little bit from that of pure de sitter space .",
    "numerically we can perform calculations close to the horizon where @xmath66 . beyond that point ,",
    "the values in calculation exceed the numerical limit .",
    "therefore , we obtain numerical solutions up to that point .    let us investigate the regular solution at the horizon .",
    "if we define @xmath67 , the scalar field equation  ( [ eq = scalar ] ) becomes @xmath68 all physical quantities in the above equation are regular at the horizon .",
    "we perform taylor expansion for each quantity about the horizon , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 we plug these quantities in the field equation  ( [ eq = scalarbq ] ) , and expand it in the power of @xmath72 . equating the coefficient of each term to be zero",
    "gives relations among coefficients in the expansion series above .",
    "the first term , @xmath73 , in the expansion gives @xmath74 in other words , @xmath75 note that this condition reduces to the regularity condition  ( [ eq = regds ] ) in de sitter space for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we numerically search the solution which satisfies the above condition close to the horizon .",
    "we found that the solution exists when @xmath78 for @xmath79 , in order to see the gravitational effect clearly . ] where @xmath80 is the location of the last mesh of our numerical calculation .",
    "this is very close to @xmath61 for the pure de sitter solution .",
    "the solution is plotted in fig.[fig = sfd ] .",
    "for this solution @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "although we are not able to perform numerical calculations beyond the horizon , we believe that the configuration is also very similar to the pure de sitter one there .",
    "we have also singular solutions similar to the de sitter ones . for the singular ones",
    ", we performed the calculation up to @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "for the texture with one winding number , we imposed the boundary value of the scalar field , @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath34 increases very rapidly close to the horizon , it is reasonable to impose this boundary value at @xmath86 estimated from the de sitter solution for @xmath87 .",
    "this solution is plotted in fig.[fig = sfd ] as well as the other singular solution for @xmath88 .",
    "similar to the de sitter solutions , there also exist unconventional solutions for @xmath89 .",
    "this range got narrowed compared with the de sitter one .",
    "the gravitational fields of the singular solution for @xmath90 are plotted in fig.[fig = ab ] .",
    "they are not much different from the pure de sitter solutions .",
    "as it was discussed in the previous section , the singular behavior of the derivatives of the scalar field at the horizon turns the horizon to be singular . from the regularity condition at the horizon",
    ", @xmath52 is infinite .",
    "we can not determine the definite value of @xmath53 there .",
    "it could be either finite , or infinite . from our numerical calculations , however , it is obvious that @xmath53 is a very large number .",
    "this indicates that the curvature at the horizon diverges .",
    "the ricci scalar evaluated from the energy - momentum tensor depends on @xmath53 , @xmath91 we plot the ricci scalar for the singular solution in fig.[fig = ricci ] .",
    "it diverges steeply approaching the horizon .",
    "the other scalar curvatures evaluated from the metric contains @xmath53 .",
    "however , it is not so clear if they involve the terms of @xmath52 which is clearly divergent .",
    "the horizon in pure de sitter space is an observer - dependent property . to a given observer @xmath92 ,",
    "it is @xmath92 s future and past event horizon beyond which events are causally disconnected with @xmath92 .",
    "observers at different locations in space have their own horizon which is different from one another .",
    "if there is a texture centered at @xmath92 s location , the spacetime is no longer homogeneous . in this situation , observers have their own horizon which is different from the one in pure de sitter space .",
    "their horizon is still a local property in terms of causality .",
    "however , the curvature singularity located at @xmath92 s horizon is a global property .",
    "every observer should recognize this singularity if it is located inside his / her own horizon .",
    "what makes the horizon , _ a priori _ , a local property of @xmath92 s be so special ( singular ) is that the texture is `` centered '' at @xmath92 s location .",
    "the way to circumvent the trouble caused by the singularity was discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is not unusual that a naked singularity exists in the geometries of topological defects .",
    "for example , global cosmic strings and supermassive gauge cosmic strings possess a singularity in the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the singularity in the string geometry is accompanied with the regular scalar field configuration . in the case of texture ,",
    "the singularity arises only when the scalar field behaves singularly at the horizon ; the horizon is regular if the scalar field is regular there .",
    "in previous sections , we found out static texture solutions co - moving with the expanding background . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was investigated that textures are very unstable even in expanding backgrounds .",
    "textures collapse , or expand further .",

    "@xcite where authors check the stability of black holes .",
    "this method finds if there is an unstable mode in perturbations , but does not describe the evolution precisely after the perturbations .",
    "let us expand the gravitational fields and the scalar field as @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 are the static solutions we obtained in the previous section , and @xmath97 is a small number .",

    "this solution satisfies @xmath104 equation and we can fix the integration constant , @xmath105 , as a boundary condition .",

    "( [ eq = a1 ] ) .",
    "this boundary condition is appropriate because it is consistent with reasonable initial conditions , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    ", as we approach the horizon , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) , region is shown in the plot , @xmath140 goes to infinity as we approach the horizon .",
    "this is evident if we consider the pure de sitter case where analytic form of radial rescale is possibly obtained , @xmath141 .",
    "we insist that the situation be similar in the self - gravitating case . ]",
    "the potential also diverges .",
    "therefore , we impose boundary conditions , @xmath142 , which , in turn , gives @xmath143 .",

    "the static singular solution with @xmath137 is unstable .    for the other singular solutions with @xmath145 , the potential @xmath128 has a negative minimum also .",
    "however , it is very close to zero .",
    "there does not necessarily exist a negative eigenvalue in such a case .",
    "in particular , if the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath26 is raised , the minimum value of @xmath128 is raised above zero .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this type of singular solutions is stable .    even though we are not so convinced to study the unconventional solutions with @xmath146 , the potential @xmath128 for those solutions has a deep negative minimum , and the solutions are unstable .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper , we will consider that textures are stable only for @xmath147 .    as a result ,",
    "the static regular solution and singular solutions with a high winding number up to one ( or , a little bit higher than one ) are unstable under perturbations .",
    ", where @xmath148 is the value of the scalar field at the boundary under consideration . in this work ,",
    "however , we shall mostly use @xmath148 for numerical values rather than elaborating to calculate the corresponding @xmath149 . ] depending on the boundary conditions imposed at the moment of perturbations , textures collapse , or expand w.r.t . the expanding background .",
    "the perturbed expansion proceeds behind the cosmological horizon , so it is not very interesting cosmologically .",
    "the collapse will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we qualitatively discuss the evolution of the configurations we obtained .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the configurations are self - similar regardless of the @xmath27 scale . imposing a definite @xmath27 value fixes the physical length scale .",
    "if @xmath27 is very large and dominates the energy density of the universe , the situation corresponds to inflation . the large @xmath27 plays the role of the vacuum energy given by the inflaton field . in this case , the cosmological horizon scale determined by the total energy of the universe is comparable to the horizon scale @xmath150 of our solution .",
    "then the whole configuration we obtained up to the horizon is applicable .",
    "unstable textures collapse during inflation .",
    "even if the collapse reaches a relativistic speed , however , it would not be able to compensate the inflationary expansion .",
    "textures survive for the inflation era .",
    "after inflation ends , textures will collapse to the origin very quickly , and unwind themselves in the end .",
    "for the rest of the history of the universe except present , @xmath27 remains very small compared with the total energy .",
    "the cosmological horizon scale is much smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "if textures are formed at this stage , the causality bound prohibits the formation of a large texture extended to @xmath151 .",
    "neighboring textures are formed before that . even though such a large texture had been formed with a high winding number up to one",

    "after textures start to collapse , they will see the scalar field with higher values crossing into the boundary of the universe . in the end",
    ", the observers who initially saw a part of the winding , will see the complete winding of the field .",
    "we found that the static textures for @xmath152 are unstable .",
    "even though the universe with a cosmological constant is topologically different from those without it , ( for example , there is no static solution for high winding numbers in the others ) collapsing behavior is very similar . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was investigated that textures collapse for winding number @xmath153 in the flat , radiation , and matter background .",
    "depending on the initial configuration imposed , the collapsing time varies .",
    "it can be explained as following . for @xmath154 , there does not exist a static solution in such backgrounds . imposing",
    "the initial configuration already implies a certain amount of perturbation . the higher @xmath149 is , the larger are the perturbations . for our case ,",
    "the static configuration will start to collapse slowly .",
    "however , the collapse will reach a relativistic speed in the end .",
    "textures with @xmath147 are stable according to our investigation . as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , they behave as a local fluctuation , and will decay into goldstone bosons .",
    "in this work , we investigated o(4 ) textures with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "it has been previously investigated that o(4 ) textures collapse in the flat , self - gravitating , radiation , and matter background .",
    "there was no static solution found out in those backgrounds , especially for high winding number textures .",
    "however , with a cosmological constant , we found out that o(4 ) textures have static configurations for all winding numbers up to slightly higher than one .",
    "de sitter expansion of the background prevents the texture from collapsing .",
    "however , the static configuration is unstable under small perturbations if the winding number is larger than some critical value , @xmath152 ( for @xmath155 ) .",
    "the textures with such high winding numbers will collapse after the perturbations are applied .",
    "initially the collapse will occur slowly , but it will reach a relativistic speed in the end . at the final stage , the field gradient energy will be concentrated about the center , and textures will unwind .",
    "meanwhile , textures will leave a signature in the large - scale structure formation of the universe .",
    "the resulting signature will be similar to that of the textures in the other backgrounds .",
    "the static configurations we obtained fit the region inside the horizon .",
    "they co - move with the expanding background while they are stable .",
    "the scalar field is definite everywhere within the horizon . for most of the configurations except the regular one ,",
    "the static solutions have singular field derivatives at the horizon .",
    "this singular behavior turns the horizon to become a curvature singularity .",
    "however , this is not a matter so much because the horizon is always located outside the cosmological causal bound .",
    "the detailed evolution based on solving time - dependent field equations was not investigated in this work .",
    "it will be interesting to perform numerical simulations for such a evolution . in this case",
    ", we can extend the model to a quintessence field background of which equation of state is @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "for such a field , there would not exist a static description of the spacetime .",
    "therefore , numerical simulation is very useful to investigate the evolution",
    ". the quintessence field may affect the texture evolution more than the cosmological constant , because its energy density could be relatively high at the early stage of the universe .",
