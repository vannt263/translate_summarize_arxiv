    "the potential importance of topological field configurations in generating a finite correlation length in the dynamics of thermalized , nonabelian gauge fields @xcite was emphasized a long time ago @xcite . in particular , calorons ,",
    "i.e. instantons at finite temperature @xmath2 play an important role in the description of pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) yang - mills theories in their deconfining phase .",
    "however , the inclusion of topologically nontrivial field configurations when evaluating thermodynamical quantities is complicated because of the nonlinearity of the theory @xcite .",
    "also , there is no a priori infrared - cutoff when integrating out residual quantum fluctuations about these finite - action configurations @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite the possibility that a scalar adjoint field @xmath3 can act as a thermal average upon calorons and anticalorons was addressed .",
    "more precisely , bps saturated and stable ( trivial holonomy ) configurations of topological charge modulus @xmath4 , harrington - shepard solutions @xcite , were integrated into an adjoint scalar field @xmath3 in the deconfining phase .",
    "this field @xmath5 , which is part of the thermal ground state , affects thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the scalar field @xmath5 induces an adjoint higgs mechanism : some of the gauge modes acquire a ( temperature - dependent ) mass on tree - level .",
    "notice that rotational symmetry in the thermal system together with the perturbative renormalizability of the fundamental yang - mills action @xcite forbid the emergence of any other composite field , induced by bps saturated , nonpropagating , fundamental field configurations , but an adjoint scalar field transforms homogeneously under changes of the gauge . on the fundamental level the only homogeneously transforming quantity is the field strength and ( nonlocal ) products thereof which can always be reduced to spin-0 and spin-1 representations of su(2 ) . while the former is irrelevant on bps saturated configurations the latter plays an important role .",
    "a rigorous version of the here - sketched argument will be presented in @xcite . ] .    to be more definite ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath6 the fundamental @xmath7 yang - mills lagrangian , with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the fundamental coupling ) .",
    "in the partition function all possible configurations of the field @xmath10 have to be considered , including the topologically nontrivial ones . upon the emergence of the scalar adjoint field @xmath5 we are led to consider the effective lagrangian @xmath11 where @xmath12 the fields @xmath13 refer to ( coarse - grained ) topologically trivial fluctuations and",
    "@xmath14 denotes the _ effective _ coupling constant .",
    "the effect of topology is embodied in the scalar adjoint field @xmath15 which acts as a background for the dynamics of propagating gauge fields . while the field @xmath3 acts as an infrared - cutoff in the spatial coarse - graining performed in the fundamental theory @xcite it represents an ultraviolet cutoff in the coarse - grained theory , implying a rapidly converging loop expansion @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the yang - mills scale , was evaluated in @xcite by performing the spatial average over calorons explicitely .    in this work",
    "we would like to show that apart from general properties such as gauge invariance and the periodicity of @xmath5 in the euclidean time the potential @xmath18 follows by requiring bps saturation .",
    "that is , no _",
    "explicit _ calculation involving calorons is needed to derive @xmath18 . over and above",
    "the existence of a yang - mills scale @xmath19 , which needed to be assumed in @xcite , turns out to be redundant since @xmath19 is shown to be a purely nonperturbative constant of integration .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec.[gi ] we discuss the implications of bps saturation for the dynamics of the field @xmath5 .",
    "the properties of ( coarse - grained ) topologically trivial fluctuations and the combined effect of the ground state and the excitations on basic thermodynamical quantities are investigated in sec.[q=0 ] . in sec.[gc ] we show that a gluon condensate emerges in the framework of the effective theory and that its @xmath20-dependence is in agreement with lattice results @xcite .",
    "in the deconfining phase of thermalized su(2 ) yang - mills theory we study the possibility that an adjoint scalar field @xmath3 describes ( part of ) the thermal ground state .",
    "namely , we postulate that @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 , emerges from by virtue of a _ spatial _ average over ( anti)selfdual fundamental field configurations in euclidean spacetime .",
    "intuitively , we assume that the nontrivial nature of the yang - mills ground state can be described by a scalar - adjoint field @xmath5 .    without the need to perform the average",
    "explicitely the field @xmath3 enjoys the following general properties as a consequence : ( i ) since @xmath3 is obtained by a spatial coarse - graining over noninteracting , _ stable _ , bps saturated field configurations ( topology changing energy and pressure free fluctuations ) it is itself bps saturated , thus the associated energy density vanishes .",
    "( ii ) originating from periodic - in-@xmath24 field configurations ( in a given gauge ) it is itself periodic .",
    "( iii ) the gauge invariant modulus @xmath25 does not depend on spacetime ( trivial expansion into matsubara frequencies due to coarse - graining over energy and pressure free configurations ) .",
    "we will now show that conditions ( i)-(iii ) uniquely fix the potential @xmath26 for the field @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) when working with a canonical kinetic term in its euclidean lagrangian density @xmath29 : on the macroscopic level . ] @xmath30 since the coarse - graining is over exact solutions to the yang - mills equations the emerging field @xmath3 must minimize the effective action .",
    "thus @xmath5 satisfies the euler - lagrange equations subject to eq.(lagphi ) : @xmath31where @xmath32 .",
    "the gauge invariance of the potential @xmath33 ( central potential ) in eq.(orbiteq ) implies that the solution has to describe motion in a plane of the three - dimensional vector space spanned by the lie - algebra valued generators of su(2 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "( the angular momentum is a constant of motion in a central potential . )    without restriction of generality ( a global gauge choice ) we choose the plane @xmath34 .",
    "thus the solution takes the following form : @xmath35 or in components @xmath36 according to ( ii ) the function @xmath37 needs to satisfy the following condition @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an integer .",
    "finally , condition ( i ) implies the vanishing of the ( euclidean ) energy density @xmath40 : @xmath41    substituting eq.([phi1 ] ) into eq.([bpsphi ] ) we have @xmath42according to ( iii ) the potential @xmath43 does not depend on @xmath44 . as a consequence of eq.([uno ] ) , we then have @xmath45 . together with eq.(theta ) this yields : @xmath46up to an inessential constant phase ( global gauge choice ) .",
    "notice that the case @xmath47 is excluded if we impose that is excluded for bps saturated , microscopic field configurations if we insist on a nonvanishing action .",
    "] @xmath48 .",
    "now eq.([thetan ] ) implies that @xmath49 , and thus we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ orbiteq ] ) that @xmath50 eliminating @xmath51 from eqs.([uno ] ) and ( [ due ] ) we have : @xmath52notice that eq.([diffeq ] ) is valid for all values of @xmath53 .",
    "the unique solution to the first - order differential equation ( [ diffeq ] ) is @xmath54where the mass scale @xmath19 enters as a constant of integration . on dimensional grounds @xmath19 has to appear with the sixth power .",
    "we interprete @xmath19 as the yang - mills scale which , however , is not operational on the level of bps saturated dynamics , see below .",
    "( on this level the energy - momentum tensor vanishes . )",
    "let us now determine the modulus @xmath55 by inserting the potential @xmath56 and eq.([thetan ] ) into eq.([uno ] ) we have @xmath57this implies that the field @xmath5 vanishes in a power - like way with increasing temperature .",
    "the value of the integer @xmath39 can not be determined within the macroscopic approach we have applied to deduce @xmath5 s potential .",
    "microscopically , one observes that the definition of @xmath5 s phase does only allow for the contribution of harrington - shepard solutions @xcite of topological charge modulus @xmath4 which implies that @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "finally , we point out the inertness of the field @xmath5 . according to eqs.([potential ] ) and ( [ lagphi ] ) the square of the mass @xmath59 of potential ( radial ) fluctuations @xmath60 is given as ( setting @xmath61 ) @xmath62 thus @xmath63 , and no thermal excitations exist . on the other hand",
    ", we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 . for @xmath66 one",
    "has that @xmath67 . in practice , @xmath68 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since @xmath69 is the maximal resolving power allowed in the effective theory we conclude that quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath3 do not exist .",
    "for the reader s convenience we briefly repeat the derivation of hofmann leading to the complete ground - state description of su(2 ) yang - mills thermodynamics in its deconfining phase .",
    "if topological fluctuations were absent then renormalizability @xcite would assure that the action of the fundamental theory is form - invariant under the applied spatial coarse - graining .",
    "since the topological part is integrated into an inert field @xmath5 this still holds true for the part of the effective action induced by @xmath70-fluctuations @xmath71 .",
    "we thus are confronted with the following , gauge invariant effective lagrangian for the dynamics of coarse - grained @xmath70 fluctuations @xmath72 subject to the background @xmath5 : @xmath73 = \\mbox{tr}\\,\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}\\,g^{e}_{\\mu \\nu } g_{e}^{\\mu \\nu } + \\left ( d_{\\mu } \\phi",

    "according to eq.(lageff ) the equation of motion for the field @xmath72 is : @xmath75\\ , .",
    "\\label{ym1}\\]]this is solved by the pure - gauge configuration @xmath76 given as @xmath77 the entire ground state thus is described by the @xmath78 implying a ground - state pressure @xmath79 and energy density @xmath80 given as @xmath81 : the inclusion of gluon fluctuations , which contribute to the dynamics of the ground - state , by virtue of @xmath76 after coarse - graining shifts the vanishing results , obtained from bps saturated configurations alone , to finite values .",
    "this makes the yang - mills scale @xmath19 ( gravitationally ) visible . turning to propagating fluctuations @xmath82 in the effective theory it is advantageous to work in unitary gauge .      by performing a gauge rotation",
    "is smooth and antiperiodic .",
    "one can introduce a center jump to make it periodic by sacrificing its smoothness @xcite .",
    "however , the associated electric center flux does not carry any energy or pressure and the periodicity of effective gluon fluctuations is maintained .",
    "these are the physical reasons why the transformation to unitary gauge is admissible . ]",
    "@xmath83 we have that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this is the unitary gauge .",
    "the field strength @xmath86 and the covariant derivative @xmath87 are functionals of the fluctuations @xmath82 only .",

    "\\label{lagfirstord}\\]]fluctuations @xmath89 are massive in a temperature dependent way while the mode @xmath90 remains massless representing the fact that su(2 ) is broken to its subgroup u(1 ) by the field @xmath5 .",
    "one has @xmath91      from the effective lagrangian ( [ lagfirstord ] ) we derive the energy density @xmath92 and the pressure @xmath93 on the one - loop level .",
    "this is accurate on the 0.1%-level as shown in @xcite .",
    "this strong suppression of the effects of residual @xmath70 quantum fluctuations in the effective theory takes place due to limited resolution , given by the modulus @xmath69 , and due to emergent , temperature - dependent tree - level mass .",
    "both phenomena introduce nonperturbative aspects into the loop expansion based on the tree - level action eq.([lagfirstord ] ) which render the radiative corrections small .    on the one - loop level",
    "we have @xmath94where the subscript 1,2 is understood as a sum over the two massive modes .",
    "explicitely , we have : @xmath95 the effective coupling constant @xmath14 is a function of the temperature @xmath96 , and so is @xmath97 .",
    "the function @xmath96 is deduced by requiring the validity of the legendre transformation @xmath98 in the effective theory .    by substituting the equations ( [ rhop ] ) into ( [ legendre ] ) we obtain : @xmath99 solving the differential equation ( [ eqdiff ] ) and inverting the solution , the function @xmath100 follows by virtue of eq.([masssp ] ) .",
    "eq.([eqdiff ] ) is of first order .",
    "thus a boundary condition needs to be prescribed .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the evolution at low temperature decouples from the boundary physics at high temperature .",
    "that is , there exists a low - temperature attractor to the evolution .",
    "this attractor is characterized by a logarithmic pole , @xmath101 where @xmath102 , signalizing the presence of a phase transition , and by a plateau @xmath103 for @xmath20 sufficiently larger than @xmath104 , indicating magnetic charge conservation for screened monopoles .    in fig.[fig-1",
    "] we indicate the ( scaled ) energy density @xmath92 , pressure @xmath93 , and entropy density @xmath105 as functions of temperature . a detailed comparison of these results with those obtained on the lattice ( for both differential and integral method ) is carried out in the first reference of @xcite .",
    "while there is good agreement for the infrared safe quantity entropy density @xmath105 the pressure @xmath93 becomes negative close to the phase boundary which is qualitatively in agreement with the result of the differential method but not with that of the integral method .",
    "we start with an intuitive discussion on the gluon condensate . as emphasized in @xcite , at @xmath106 instantons are responsible for a nonzero gluon condensate @xcite . in fact , the average @xmath107 is zero at any order in perturbation theory ( @xmath108 is the fundamental stress - energy tensor ) .",
    "instantons are selfdual solutions in euclidean spacetime , which , in minkowski space , are interpreted as tunnelling events implying @xmath109 and so generate a positive average @xmath110 .",
    "an estimate of the gluon condensate is thus obtained by evaluating the action density in euclidean spacetime @xmath111 @xcite .    in the framework of the effective theory for thermalized , deconfining su(2 )",
    "yang - mills dynamics we evaluate the action density by virtue of eq.([lageff ] ) .",
    "thus the average @xmath112 corresponds to@xmath113where a proportionality between the average @xmath114 over fundamental fields and the average @xmath115 evaluated in the effective theory with coarse - grained fields holds @xcite .",
    "we notice that the ground - state energy density @xmath116 is responsible for the emergence of a nonvanishing thermal average @xmath110 .",
    "more precisely , the gluon condensate should be defined as a renormalization - group invariant object .",
    "this holds for @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the full beta - function for the fundamental coupling @xmath9 , compare with @xcite . by virtue of the trace anomaly",
    "we can evaluate this quantity as @xmath119 in @xcite we have shown that within the effective theory a linear growth @xmath120 for @xmath121 follows .",
    "such a linear growth has been found by lattice simulations @xcite and also in an analytical approach @xcite . in the latter a momentum - dependent , universal modification of the dispersion relation for propagating , fundamental gluon fields , motivated by the reduction of the physical state space a la gribov ,",
    "is introduced .",
    "while this is interesting a direct comparison of both approaches beyond the observation of a linear growth of the trace anomaly would need a coarse - graining over the modified gluon propagation of @xcite .",
    "in this article we have derived the potential @xmath122 for an inert , adjoint scalar field @xmath5 by solely assuming its origin to be a spatial average over noninteracting , bps saturated topological field configurations in the underlying theory : su(2 ) yang - mills thermodynamics being in its deconfining phase .",
    "that is , no detailed microscopic information on these configurations other than their stability and bps saturation is needed to derive the potential for the effective field @xmath5 .",
    "the conceptually interesting implication of our present work is that the yang - mills scale @xmath19 emerges as a constant of integration : @xmath19 s existence needs not be assumed as in @xcite . for our presentation to be selfcontained we have repeated the derivation of the effective action , involving the field @xmath5 as a background , for the coarse - grained , topologically trivial fluctuations . we also have pointed out that the ( linear ) temperature dependence of the gluon condensate agrees with that found in lattice simulations .",
