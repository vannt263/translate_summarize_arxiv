    "a wealth of nuclear phenomena , including dynamical processes in nuclear reactions , nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics are intimately affected by the density dependence of the symmetry energy term in the nuclear equation of state ( eos )  @xcite .",

    "the extracted temperature values are compared to those of the fluctuation thermometer , assuming @xmath156 .",
    "the fluctuation thermometer shows significantly higher temperature values and a different trend as a function of fragment mass . after the correction for the radial flow the trends and the differences",
    "are well understood as resulting from the combination of the thermal and radial collective motions under momentum conservation .",
    "the mass dependence of the apparent temperature observed from the improved method originates from the system size effect under this momentum conservation .",
    "this indicates that the fluctuation thermometer can provide a reasonable probe for the temperature of the multi - fragmentation source if the contribution of collective flows is properly corrected .",
