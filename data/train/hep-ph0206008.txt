    "the standard model ( sm ) has been thoroughly tested in various experiments even if the higgs boson remains as the only missing ingredient . in the theoretical view point , however , the sm has several unsatisfactory aspects such as the gauge hierarchy problem : the higgs boson mass near the electroweak scale requires a fine tuning to eliminate quadratically divergent radiative corrections .",
    "low - energy supersymmetry is known to cancel the quadratic divergence by introducing a supersymmetric partner for each sm particle @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry protects the electroweak scale higgs mass from the planck scale , as the chiral ( gauge ) symmetry does for fermions ( gauge bosons ) .",
    "recently another new route to the solution of the gauge hierarchy problem has been opened based on the advances in string theories , by introducing extra dimensions .",
    "arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) proposed that the large volume of @xmath6-dimensional extra dimensions can explain the observed huge planck scale @xmath7 @xcite : the fundamental gravitational scale or string scale @xmath8 is related with the planck scale @xmath7 and the size of an extra dimension @xmath9 by @xmath10 ; the hierarchy problem is resolved as @xmath8 can be maintained around tev .",
    "later randall and sundrum ( rs ) proposed another higher dimensional scenario based on two branes and a single extra dimension compactified in a slice of anti - desitter space @xcite : the hierarchy problem is explained by a geometrical exponential factor . very interesting",
    "is that these extra dimensional models can lead to distinct and rich phenomenological signatures in the future colliders , characterized by low - energy gravity effects @xcite . in add case",
    ", for example , the multiplicity of gravitons below an energy scale @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath12 , which is extremely large and compensates the small gravitational coupling .",
    "an economical description of new physics to solve the gauge hierarchy problem would introduce either low - energy supersymmetry or extra dimensions .",
    "nevertheless supersymmetric bulk is theoretically more plausible  @xcite since the most realistic framework of extra dimensional models , string / m theory@xcite , indeed possesses supersymmetry as a fundamental symmetry . moreover",
    ", extra dimensions can play the role of supersymmetry breaking on a hidden brane  @xcite or in the bulk by scherk - schwarz compactification  @xcite .",
    "obviously phenomenological signatures of supersymmetric bulk are crucially dependent on how many supersymmetries survive on our brane below the scale @xmath8 .",
    "one interesting possibility is that a single supersymmetry is softly broken on our brane such that our low - energy effective theory yields supersymmetric spectra as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "one distinctive feature of this scenario is the presence of the gravitino , the superpartner of the graviton .",
    "since this gravitino also propagates in the full dimensional space as it belongs to the same supermultiplet with the graviton , we have gravitino kaluza - klein modes on our brane .",
    "the soft and spontaneous breaking of a supersymmetry results in the mass shift between a graviton kk mode and the corresponding gravitino kk mode , of order @xmath13 . here",
    "the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath14 scales the strength of gravitino coupling and @xmath15 is the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "if low - energy supersymmetry breaking is assumed , e.g. , in the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) scenario , the resulting mass shift is very light : for @xmath16 tev , @xmath17 ev . restricting ourselves to the add scenario , we have almost continuous spectrum of kk gravitinos with the zero mode mass at sub - ev scale . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the four - dimensional effective theory in a supersymmetric add scenario has been derived , including the couplings of the bulk gravitino kk states to a fermion and its superpartner . at @xmath0 colliders ,",
    "the virtual exchange of kk gravitinos can occur only in the selectron pair production which was shown to substantially enhance the total cross section and change the kinematic distributions .",
    "another distinctive signature of kk gravitinos is their production at high - energy colliders .",
    "a superlight gravitino , which becomes the stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , escapes any detector , leading to missing energy events .",
    "moreover the decay modes of a supersymmetric particle @xmath18 are now changed .",
    "even if the @xmath18 is the lightest among supersymmetric partners of the sm particles , e.g. , the photino , a new decay mode of @xmath19 is opened and dominant . as shall be discussed later",
    ", this decay rate is large enough for the photino to decay within a detector .",
    "therefore , the process @xmath2 yields a typical signature of a single photon at large transverse momentum . and the summation over all possible extra - dimensional momenta yields a sizable production rate characterized by the @xmath8 scale .",
    "this process has kinematic advantages over the selectron pair production in case the selectron is too heavy to be pair - produced .    of great significance is to signal not only the extra dimensions , but also the _ supersymmetric _ extra dimensions , i.e. , kk gravitinos .",
    "unfortunately , single photon events with missing energy in this scenario have two more sources , the sm process of @xmath20 and the kk graviton production of @xmath4 . with an appropriate cut to reduce the @xmath21-pole contributions of the sm",
    ", the kk graviton production can be compatible with the sm background at the future @xmath0 collider",
    ". however the kk gravitino production rate is smaller than the kk graviton case by an order of magnitude .",
    "this is due to the kinematic suppression by the production of the massive photino while the dependence of the @xmath8 and @xmath6 is the same for both the kk graviton and gravitino production .",
    "total cross section alone can not tell whether the bulk possesses supersymmetry or not .",
    "we shall show that the observable @xmath5 completely eliminates the kk graviton effects , but retains most of the kk gravitino effects .",
    "this is because in a supersymmetric model the sign of the coupling of a left - handed electron with a photino ( and a selectron ) is opposite to that of a right - handed electron ( a left - handed @xmath22-electron ) .",
    "the coupling with gravitino , which is gravitational , does not depend on the fermion chirality .",
    "therefore , the scattering amplitudes of the @xmath23- and @xmath24-channel diagrams , where both couplings are involved , have opposite sign for @xmath25 and @xmath26 beams . as the @xmath23- and @xmath24-channel amplitudes are added to the @xmath27-channel one , mediated by a photon , the total scattering amplitudes are different for the left- and right - handed electron beam . for the kk graviton production accompanied by a single photon ,",
    "all the involved interactions are chirality blind so that the corresponding @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ efflg ] , we review the four - dimensional effective lagrangian in a supersymmetric add scenario . and analytic expressions for photino decay rate into a photon and kk gravitinos and for the process @xmath2 are to be given .",

    "[ conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we assume that there are @xmath6 large and supersymmetric extra dimensions , and a single supersymmetry is softly broken on our brane such that our low - energy effective theory yields the mssm spectra .",
    "the cases of more than three extra dimensions are to be considered since in the @xmath29 case astrophysical and cosmological constraints are too strong that the @xmath8 is pushed up to about 100 tev , disfavored as a solution of the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite . and the mssm super - particles are assumed to be confined on our brane . new feature is then another kk tower of the gravitino .",
    "the compactification of the gravitino field in a supergravity theory leads to the four - dimensional effective action which is a sum of kk states of massive spin 3/2 gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "the free part of the effective lagrangian gives the propagator of the @xmath30-the kk mode of the gravitino with momentum @xmath31 and mass @xmath32 such as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the effective interaction lagrangian for the kk gravitino is obtained from the general noether technique , irrespective to the detailed supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",

    "we notice that there is one crucial characteristic for the gravitino production accompanied by a photino . as explicitly shown in eq .",
    "( [ lgffr ] ) , the coupling sign of a left - handed electron with a photino and a selectron is opposite to that of a right - handed electron : the holomorphy of the super - potential requires that a fermion should belong to a ( left - handed ) chiral superfield ; the right - handed electron is to be described by a left - handed @xmath22-electron , which possesses positive charge .",
    "the interaction with a gravitino , which is gravitational , does not distinguish the chirality of the involved fermion .",

    "the electron is coupled with the ordinary qed photon .",
    "since two kinds of amplitudes ( one changes the sign under the helicity flip of the electron beam , whereas the other does not ) are added , we are ended up with chirality - sensitive total cross section . note",
    "that without the @xmath27-channel diagram , the sign - change in the amplitudes alone can not yield any observable effect , as clearly shown in eq .",
    "( [ ampsq ] ) .",
    "it is to be emphasized that this feature is generic in any supersymmetric model which ensures a light gravitino . in the ordinary mssm ,",
    "this point is hard to probe .",
    "for example , in the photino pair production , double vertices of @xmath90 in the @xmath23- and @xmath24-channel feynman diagrams eliminate the difference .",
    "it is known that the availability of polarized electron and positron beams is highly expected at future linear collider@xcite : the current lc performance goal is above 80% of electron polarization and 60% of positron polarization .",
    "we propose , therefore , that the effects of kk gravitinos can be most sensitively measured by @xmath92 for the graviton production with a photon , all the involved couplings are completely blind to the helicity of the electron beam ; the @xmath28 vanishes .",

    "the cross section of the process @xmath97 obviously depends sensitively on the mass spectrum of the involved supersymmetric particles , a photino , and the left- and right - handed selectron .",
