    "it is primarily 1d , whereas interchain couplings form an intricate network that , despite being built of triangles , can not be considered as a standard triangular lattice .",
    "second , the physics of triangular antiferromagnetic materials is often influenced by the single - ion anisotropy that vanishes for the genuine cu@xmath5 ion .",
    "therefore , other sources of anisotropy , such as dzyaloshinsky - moriya couplings allowed by the chiral @xmath6 symmetry of the crystal structure , may be important . a direct investigation of the ordered phases of srcute@xmath0o@xmath1 with neutron scattering and resonance techniques would be very interesting . to the best of our knowledge , multiple magnetic transitions in zero field and the non - trivial @xmath140 phase diagram are unique for srcute@xmath0o@xmath1 among the broad family of quasi-1d antiferromagnets with uniform , non - frustrated spin-@xmath2 chains .",
    "several magnetic transitions have been observed in @xmath152-tevo@xmath7 , but no information on the nature of ordered phases is presently available,@xcite and even the topology of spin chains has been disputed.@xcite licuvo@xmath7 is another famous example of a quasi-1d system with multiple field - induced phases,@xcite yet it features only one magnetic transition in zero field , whereas the complex high - field behavior may be heavily influenced by helical correlations induced by the frustration of intrachain ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings . in summary",
    ", we have shown that srcute@xmath0o@xmath1 is a quasi-1d chain antiferromagnet that reveals non - trivial physics at low temperatures with two ordered phases in zero field and altogether three distinct phases in the @xmath147 phase diagram studied in magnetic fields up to 9 t .",
    "the behavior above the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath73 can be well understood in the framework of the heisenberg spin-@xmath2 chain model .",
    "the spin chains are formed by the exchange couplings between third neighbors , whereas interchain couplings are strongly frustrated .",
    "srcute@xmath0o@xmath1 is , thus , surprisingly different from its structural sibling pbcute@xmath0o@xmath1 , where first- , second- and third - neighbor couplings , all having similar magnitude , form a three - dimensional frustrated spin lattice and suppress the magnetic order below 1k .",
    "srcute@xmath0o@xmath1 enters the magnetically ordered phase at a somewhat higher temperature of @xmath153  k in zero field and reveals an unexpectedly complex phase diagram that calls for further experimental investigation .",
    "it is worth noting that the crystal structure of srcute@xmath0o@xmath1 is non - centrosymmetric , although non - polar .",
    "nevertheless , ferroelectricity may be induced by the magnetic order and magnetic field , similar to licuvo@xmath7 and other frustrated - chain magnets.@xcite this possibility should be explored in future studies .",
