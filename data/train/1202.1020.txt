    "observational constraints of large - scale magnetic field models have almost exclusively relied on faraday rotation of emission from galactic pulsars and polarized extragalactic sources @xcite which only probe the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field . @xcite",

    "polarization of background starlight has been an astrophysical tool since the pioneering works of @xcite and @xcite , and early theoretical work linked this optical polarization with interstellar magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "as currently understood @xcite , interstellar polarization arises from dichroic extinction of unpolarized starlight passing through regions of elongated dust grains which are directionally aligned with their long axes preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field . assuming background stars emit all polarizations equally ( i.e. , unpolarized ) , photons polarized parallel to a grain s long axis see the largest grain cross section and are preferentially extincted .",
    "the result is linear polarization whose stronger electric field direction is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field , as projected on the sky .",
    "much of the previous starlight polarization work has been done at optical wavelengths where the polarization signal is strongest @xcite .",

    "a weighted average of the differences between the model s predicted gpa and observed gpa in each latitude bin , as shown in fig .",
    "[ delta_pa ] , was calculated and the weighted uncertainty in this average difference was obtained by propagation .",
    "these values and uncertainties are listed in column ( 9 ) in table [ model_table ] .",
    "while all s0 , a0 , and deho models can be rejected at the @xmath121 level , the a0 models are particularly discrepant ( @xmath12240@xmath123 ) since they predict polarizations essentially perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "using the two tests proposed by @xcite and the observations reported here , all of the magnetic field models taken from the literature can be formally rejected as deviating by more than 3@xmath123 from the observations .",
    "the k - s analysis of cdf values was inconclusive about rejection of the predicted polarization values .",
    "none of the probabilities was high enough to suggest one set of models was the best choice , and ( except for the deho models ) the probabilities were not small enough to definitively reject classes of models outright .",
    "the differences between the predicted and observed polarization gpas as a function of galactic latitude are significant enough to reject all of the magnetic field models .",
    "however , the full interpretation of these results requires a more careful analysis .",
    "the initial results should not be completely surprising , since the actual galactic magnetic field is unlikely to be as simply represented as the simulated magnetic field models .",
    "the dynamo - driven magnetic field models have a resolution of @xmath124200 pc @xcite or @xmath124400 pc @xcite , so any turbulence or magnetic disturbances on smaller scales could not be included .",
    "the analytic axisymmetric models , with effectively infinite resolution , also lack turbulence .",

    "@xcite calculated a coherent magnetic cell size of 10 to 100 pc using galactic pulsar rotation and dispersion measures , implying that starlight from distant stars will generally pass through many cells .",
    "@xcite also discussed uncertainties in the predicted degree of polarization arising from changes in the polarization efficiency , though they are less likely to affect the gpas .",
    "this , combined with uncertainties from the calculated scale factors , creates uncertainty in the absolute probability returned by the k - s test , though the relative probabilities may still provide insight into ranked likelihoods .    considering the relative k - s probabilities in table [ model_table ] , the s0 , a0 , and analytic axisymmetric models using the @xcite dust distributions have the highest probability ( @xmath122 0.20 ) of being drawn from the same parent distribution as the observations .",
    "the deho models all produce polarization cdfs that are poor matches to the observed polarization cdf .",
    "the choice of dust model causes a significant difference in the probabilities for all models .",
    "the s0 , a0 , and analytic axisymmetric models using the @xcite dust distribution have larger ( i.e. , more similar to the observations ) probabilities than the models using the @xcite dust distribution .",
    "this is not surprising given that the @xcite dust model accounts for more details ( e.g. , spiral arms , local arm , galactic warp ) than the axisymmetric @xcite dust model .",
    "the deho models , as shown by their k - s probabilities , are unable to reproduce the observed polarizations .",
    "the amount of polarization increases as starlight passes through the regular ( uniform ) magnetic field , but depolarizes as it passes through cells of randomly oriented magnetic field .",
    "the interplay between regular and random magnetic fields is strongly dependent on the nature of turbulence , and beyond the scope of this paper . because of the lack of depolarization in the simulations",
    ", all simulated stars will show larger polarizations than would actual stars . the exact effect on the simulated degrees of polarization",
    "requires a detailed study of the ratio of power in the random and regular magnetic fields in the diffuse ism , analogous to the studies that have been conducted in higher density molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the changes to the degree of polarization caused by depolarization may be large enough to change the predicted polarization cdf and account for the significant differences measured by the k - s test .    given the uncertainties associated with the predicted degree of starlight polarization , the distribution of gpa vs. galactic latitude may serve as a _",
    "test for constraining the large - scale structure of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the a0 ( disk - odd ) galactic magnetic fields , models 7 - 12 , show huge differences between the observed and predicted gpas towards @xmath0 and are therefore not shown in fig .",
    "[ delta_pa ] . in typical a0 magnetic field models , the poloidal magnetic field has a dipolar configuration and the toroidal magnetic field consists of antisymmetric tori of magnetic flux above and below the galactic disk with opposite field directions . to sustain this structure",
    ", there must be a toroidal null point approximately in the galactic plane where the toroidal magnetic field goes to zero . at this point , only the poloidal magnetic field is expressed , which is orientated roughly in the galactic north - south direction , orthogonal to the galactic plane as seen in the simulations .",
    "also , most of the toroidal magnetic flux in the specific a0 magnetic field geometries used for these simulations ( e.g. , fig .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which probe the galactic magnetic field over kiloparsec length lines of sight .",
    "evidence for an antisymmetric magnetic field is seen in antisymmetric rotation measures above and below the galactic plane towards the galactic center .",
    "this implies that the dominant toroidal magnetic field direction is reversed above and below the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite , however , has recently shown that this observed asymmetry may be dominated by a nearby ( 100 pc ) , northern - sky , hi bubble and that the observed asymmetry may not reflect the actual large - scale galactic magnetic field . by using a different method ( starlight polarimetry instead of faraday rotation ) away from known magnetic disturbances ,",
    "the rejection of the a0 magnetic field is robust .",
    "the analytic axisymmetric models ( models 19 - 24 ) show the best overall matches , both in degree of polarization and gpa .",

    "[ delta_pa ] ) , and the uncertainty on the gpa differences near the midplane are much smaller than those at larger latitudes . for a properly weighted mean ,",
    "the change in uncertainty with latitude will cause the non - diagnostic , low latitude bins to dominate the average while the diagnostic , large latitude bins carry little weight .",

    "the a0 model predictions are strongly inconsistent with the observed distribution of nir starlight galactic position angles ( gpas ) and are thereby rejected . while here limited to a set of sample a0 models from @xcite , the ability of any a0-type magnetic field model to reproduce the observed gpa distribution in the outer galaxy is doubtful .",
    "the gpa distributions of the s0 , deho , and analytic axisymmetric models typically differ from the nir starlight observations by only a few degrees . since the model magnetic fields do not include any turbulence or systematic motions , such differences are to be expected .",
