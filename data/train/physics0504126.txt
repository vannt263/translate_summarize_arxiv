    "several recent experiments @xcite report the measurement of large , shear - dependent liquid slip at partially wetting liquid - solid surfaces .",
    "while the origin of these dramatic violations of the no - slip boundary condition is still controversial @xcite , interest is beginning to develop in how these effects may be exploited in microfludics @xcite .",
    "microfludics is undergoing rapid growth with applications to chemical and biochemical synthesis @xcite , and high - throughput synthesis and screening @xcite .",
    "these applications require the manipulation of fluids in microchannels where flows are limited to very low reynolds numbers . as a result , mixing in microfluidic devices tends to be diffusion dominated , requiring long channels and long retention times to achieve good mixing . as the scale of this technology continues to diminish the effects of low reynolds numbers",
    "will become more significant .",
    "however , the effect of slip at channel walls also increases at small length scales so it is natural to ask whether the effects of slip can be used to overcome some of the disadvantages of laminar flow @xcite .",
    "to increase mixing rates it is necessary to induce transverse or circulating flows in a channel , increasing interfacial area between fluids or streamlines ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "this can be achieved by active mixers , which possess moving parts , but these can be difficult to fabricate and maintain .",
    "passive mixers on the other hand achieve mixing by virtue of their topology alone and have no moving parts . suggested designs for passive mixers include using channels with patterned topography @xcite , or channels with patterned surface charge in electro - osmotic flows @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use chemically patterned channel surfaces .",
    "for example , kuksenok and co - workers @xcite have modeled the mixing of a binary ab fluid in channels patterned with a - like and b - like regions .",
    "yet another approach might be to use patterned wettability to induce variations in slip .",
    "slip is often characterised by a slip - length @xmath0 , which is the distance at which the fluid velocity at a surface ( i.e. the slip velocity ) vanishes if it is linearly extrapolated beyond the surface .",
    "measurements of slip lengths do vary widely but some groups have reported slip lengths of several microns @xcite . it is common to invoke the formation of nanobubbles at the hydrophobic surface @xcite to explain such large slip lengths .",
    "however there is still much disagreement about the magnitude of slip that can be induced although lengths of tens to hundreds of nanometers seem to be more typical @xcite .",
    "furthermore other factors such as surface roughness and surface contamination do seem influence slip length measurements considerably @xcite .",
    "lauga and stone @xcite have recently considered the effect of patterned no - slip and no - shear stress regions in pressure - driven stokes flow in a cylindrical geometry where the no - shear stress regions model the presence of micro or nanobubbles on channel walls . from this",
    "they derive an effective macroscopic slip - length which indeed is found to depend on shear - rate and geometry .    here",
    "we will assume that the variations in wettability can produce variations in the slip of the flow at the channel walls .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of flow past hydrophobic surfaces @xcite certainly demonstrate a strong relationship between wettability and slip , although the slip lengths found tend to be of the order of a few of tens molecular diameters at most . however , as noted above , the formation of nanobubbles at hydrophobic surfaces may well be able to induce very large slip lengths : thus large variations in wettability on a surface might be expected to produce large variations in slip length .",
    "we begin by studying a newtonian flow in a simple channel with a slip boundary condition characterised by a slip - length @xmath0 that varies in space i.e. @xmath1 . in the first instance we are interested in seeing the effect of a variable slip length on the flow , and secondly , in evaluating the possible exploitation of such effects in designing a microfluidic mixing device .",
    "as this is a preliminary study , we will approach the problem analytically , using a pertubative scheme to satisfy the slip boundary condition .    in section 4",
    ", we will use molecular dynamics simulations of the flow of a lennard - jones fluid between two plates .",
    "the interaction between the plates and the fluid will be allowed to vary in space in order to test the predictions of the analysis in sections 2 - 3 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings here for the design of mixers in microchannels using chemical patterning .",
    "we start with the navier - stokes equations for a viscous incompressible fluid : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the velocity field , @xmath5 the fluid pressure , @xmath6 is the fluid density and @xmath7 is the fluid viscosity .",
    "we consider a pressure driven flow in a two - dimensional channel geometry corresponding to flow between two plates as illustrated in figure  [ geometry ] .",
    "the channel has length @xmath8 and width @xmath9 . at the channel walls we have navier",
    "slip boundary condition @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the longtunidal velocity component ( @xmath12-direction ) .",
    "the transverse velocity component @xmath13 ( @xmath14-direction ) satisifies @xmath15 at the walls . at the channel exit and entry",
    "we prescribe the pressure to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively giving a pressure head across the channel of @xmath18 .",
    "the solution to ( [ momentum0]-[slipbc ] ) is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximum fluid velocity in the absence of slip",
    ".    we will now allow the slip length to vary in the @xmath12 direction i.e. @xmath21 specifically , we will consider the following slip boundary condition : @xmath22    if @xmath23 then we can apply a perturbative approach @xmath24 where @xmath25 solve the constant slip - length boundary condition problem ( [ momentum0]-[slipbc ] ) .",
    "the equations for the first - order corrections in @xmath26 are then given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 with boundary condition @xmath29 the boundary condition immediately suggests the solution ansatz @xmath30 . inserting this into equation ( [ mass1 ] ) , we find that @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 since @xmath34 by symmetry",
    ".    we can now eliminate @xmath35 from ( [ momentum1x ] ) and ( [ momentum1y ] ) to obtain the following ordinary differential equation for @xmath36 :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the specific viscosity . in terms of @xmath39 the boundary condition ( [ firstorderbc ] ) becomes @xmath40 we note that differential equation ( [ diffh ] ) is homogeneous , so the magnitude of @xmath39 will be set by the boundary condition ( [ hbc ] ) .",
    "further when @xmath23 , ( [ diffh ] ) and ( [ hbc ] ) form a quasilinear boundary value problem .",
    "in the following section we will examine the solution to this problem in a number of limiting cases .",
    "at this stage we will introduce some scales into the problem .",
    "as the effects of boundary slip on the flow scale as @xmath41 ( see equation  [ constantslipu ] ) , at widths substantially greater than the slip length , a surface with patterned wettability will have an insignificant effect on the flow . with values of the slip - length of up",
    "to several microns reported in the literature @xcite , we will confine ourselves to discussion of channels with widths @xmath42 .",
    "obviously the wavelength of the slip variations @xmath43 is bounded above by the length of the channel @xmath8 .",
    "the wavelength is bounded below by the minimum size on which the slip can be patterned .",
    "while microcontact printing @xcite or photolithography of hydrophilic or hydrophobic self - assembled monolayers might be limited to wavelengths greater than several hundred @xmath7 m , in principle , it is still of interest to consider the limit as @xmath44 nm .",
    "this might achieved using a combination of self - assembly by block copolymers and lithography for example @xcite .",
    "hence it is reasonable to consider patternings that satisfy @xmath45 nm .      in the limit where @xmath46 and @xmath47 then equation ( [ diffh ] ) reduces to @xmath48 for instance , in the case of water which is flowing at 0.01 @xmath49 in a 10 @xmath7m - width channel ( i.e. 1 nanoliter per second ) then @xmath50 for @xmath51 m .",
    "note that equation ( [ diffh - lim2 ] ) is real ( whereas the equation ( [ diffh ] ) is complex ) so the variation in longitudinal flow velocity is in phase with the variations in slip length while the variations in transverse flow velocity are @xmath52 out of phase with the variations in slip length ( recall equation ( [ h - def ] ) ) .",
    "the solution to ( [ diffh - lim2 ] ) with boundary condition ( [ hbc ] ) to order @xmath26 is given by    @xmath53    where we recall that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "figure  [ h - plot ] shows @xmath36 for @xmath56 10 , 1 and 0.1 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ diffh - lim2 ] ) and figure  [ h - plot ] that the magnitude of @xmath57 controls the variation away from the walls in @xmath36 and hence in @xmath58 and @xmath59 . with @xmath60 , then the transverse velocity induced @xmath58 is confined to very near the walls . indeed , from figure  [ h - plot ] we see that to maximize both the magnitude of @xmath36 , and its penetration towards the centre of the channel we should choose @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , figure  [ dh - plot ] shows @xmath62 for @xmath63 and 0.1 .",
    "figure  [ v3d - plot ] shows a flooded contour plot of the variations in both velocity components ( @xmath59 and @xmath58 ) along a long channel ( @xmath64 ) with @xmath65 , and figure  [ vec - plot ] shows a vector plot of the velocity components in a shorter channel ( @xmath66 ) with @xmath65 .",
    "note that where the slip at the channel wall is high , the flow velocity increases at the channel walls , but _ decreases _ in the center of the channel",
    ". likewise , where the slip is low , the flow velocity decreases at the channel wall but increases in the center of the channel . between the peaks and troughs in slip ,",
    "transverse flow is generated away from or towards the channel walls .",
    "we can also look at square - wave variations in slip length , utilizing the fourier series for a square wave of wavelength @xmath67 : @xmath68 since equation ( [ diffh - lim2 ] ) is linear we can solve for each fourier mode and resum to obtain the solution for a square wave variation in @xmath69 .",
    "doing so gives @xmath70 figure  [ v3dsq - plot ] shows a flooded contour plot of the velocity components @xmath58 and @xmath59 for a square wave variation in @xmath0 with @xmath71 .",
    "now we consider the situation where @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , in the case of water which is flowing at 0.01 @xmath49 in a 10 @xmath7m - width channel ( i.e. 1 nanoliter per second ) then @xmath73 for @xmath74 m .",
    "this corresponds to a slow flow with spatial variations in slip length occuring on scales greater than the channel width .",
    "now equation ( [ diffh ] ) reduces to : @xmath75 the solution to this equation with boundary conditions ( [ hbc ] ) is    @xmath76    where @xmath77 note that when @xmath78 , the expression ( [ solh-2 ] ) for @xmath36 reduces to the expression ( [ solh-1 ] ) from the previous section .",
    "in fact it is instructive ( although tedious ) to write ( [ solh-2 ] ) in the form of ( [ solh-1 ] ) plus corrections in @xmath79 . doing so we can write @xmath80 as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is given by equation  [ solh-1 ] , @xmath83 and @xmath84 note that the first order correction in @xmath79 is purely imaginary .",
    "thus it introduces a phase lag the response of the fluid to the slip at the walls ( moving it downstream ) and increases the magnitude of @xmath36 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ ulag - plot ] which compares the velocity @xmath59 in the centre of the channel for @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) for @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( a large value of @xmath79 is chosen here so that the effect of this term is easily visible ) .",
    "to study the effect of spatially varying wettability on flow in a channel at a molecular level , we have followed the approach of barrat and bocquet @xcite .",
    "we consider a lennard - jones fluid with atomic mass @xmath89 confined between two walls with periodic boundary conditions applied in the plane of the walls .",
    "the walls consist of fixed lennard - jones atoms and interact with the fluid via a modified lennard - jones potential of the form : @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 controls the degree of wettability of the walls @xcite .",
    "note that the fluid atoms also interact according to potential ( [ eq - lj ] ) with @xmath92 . here",
    "we will consider flows where @xmath93 to model the effect of chemical patterning of the channel walls .",
    "we used a simulation cell containing 6750 fluid atoms within a volume of approximately @xmath94 .",
    "the temperature was controlled using nos - hoover thermostat @xcite on the velocity component of the fluid atoms parallel to the channel walls but perpendicular to the imposed flow direction ( in figure  [ geometry ] this is the direction into the page ) .",
    "flow can be induced by applying a body force to the fluid atoms in a direction parallel to walls giving a poiseuille - type flow , or by dragging one of the walls past the fluid which induces a couette flow .",
    "here we only consider the former as our intention is to make a comparison with the pressure - driven flows of the previous section .",
    "when @xmath95 everywhere the flows are well - approximated by solutions to the incompressible navier - stokes equations ( [ momentum0]-[mass0 ] ) with a no - slip boundary condition , although density variations occur near the walls due to the well - known tendancy for fluid atoms to layer at a solid interface . furthermore , when @xmath96 but is constant everywhere , we find that the flow is reasonably well - approximated by solutions to the navier - stokes equations with a slip boundary condition ( [ slipbc ] ) .",
    "our simulations are in good agreement with barrat and bocquet @xcite .",
    "we now consider the simulation of flows in a channel with patterned slip length .",
    "the equation for @xmath97 on the channel walls is : @xmath98 where @xmath99 ( i.e. the wavelength of the pattern is 20 @xmath100 , which is the width of channel ) .",
    "note that the mean value of @xmath97 is 0.7 .",
    "our simulations show that such a patterning does indeed induce a variation in slip length along the channel walls .",
    "for instance , as illustrated in figure  [ patterned - slip ] for a simulated flow with peak flow longitudinal flow velocity @xmath101 , we calculated an effective slip length of @xmath102 by fitting a parabolic profile @xmath103 to the longitudinal velocity profile in the solvophilic region ( @xmath104 i.e. where @xmath105 ) . in the the solvophobic region ( @xmath106 @xmath107 )",
    "we calculated an effective slip length @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , for a simulated flow with peak flow longitudinal flow velocity @xmath109 , we calculated an effective slip length of @xmath110 in the solvophilic region ( @xmath104 i.e. where @xmath105 ) .",
    "likewise in the the solvophobic region ( @xmath106 @xmath107 ) we calculated an effective slip length @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , these variations in effective slip length induce transverse flows as anticipated in the previous sections .",
    "figure  [ md - inphase ] shows the time - averaged transverse velocity of a flow , with peak longitudinal flow velocity @xmath109 .",
    "the peak transverse velocity is @xmath112 .",
    "regions with light shading indicate flow in the @xmath14-direction and regions with dark shading indicate flow in the negative @xmath14-direction .",
    "note that the variations in @xmath113 are @xmath52 out of phase with the variations in @xmath97 as predicted by our analysis in section 3 . to compare the magnitude of the variations in @xmath13 from the simulation to the theory of the previous sections , we use the effective slip lengths calculated above .",
    "thus @xmath114 and @xmath115 in equation ( [ fullbc ] ) .",
    "figure  [ mdvth ] compares the theoretically expected variation in @xmath13 at @xmath116 across the channel for a square wave variation in slip length ( see equation ( [ sq - v ] ) ) to the time - averaged simulated variations .",
    "it is seen from the comparison that the theory underestimates the peak values of @xmath13 by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "figure  [ md - outofphase ] shows a faster flow with peak longitudinal flow velocity is @xmath117 and peak transverse velocity is @xmath118 .",
    "regions with light shading indicate flow in the @xmath14-direction and regions with dark shading indicate flow in the negative @xmath14-direction .",
    "note the downstream phase lag in the variations in @xmath113 with respect to the variations in @xmath113 in the slower flow shown in figure  [ md - inphase ] .",
    "we have not made a direct comparison of this phase lag with the predicted phase lag in equation ( [ phase - lag ] ) as we were unable to solve the full equation for @xmath39 ( [ diffh ] ) for fast flows analytically .",
    "however , once again we find that the theory underestimates the peak values of @xmath13 by a factor of 2 .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations in section 4 demonstrate that patterned wettability will induce patterned variations in slip length .",
    "while this is not surprising given the demonstrated link between wettability and slip in other molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , it supports the use of the boundary condition ( [ formalbc ] ) in evaluating the effect of patterned wettability on flow .",
    "furthermore we found a strong qualitative agreement between the molecular dynamics simulations and the approximate analytic solutions developed in sections 2 - 3 , although the theory tended to underestimate the magnitude of the variations in flow due the patterning by a factor of 2 .",
    "this underestimation may in part be due to the way the theory was fitted to the simulations ( i.e. by fitting effective slip lengths in the different channel regions ) .",
    "however , the theory also assumes the fluid is incompressible , whereas substantial variations in fluid density can occur at the walls .",
    "in particular , a reduction in the density of the fluid near the solvophobic region of the wall relative to the solvophilic region of the wall , as observed in the md simulations , would tend to enhance the transverse variations in flow .",
    "finally , we note that in our analysis in sections 2 - 3 we only solved the slip boundary condition to order @xmath26 ( the relative variation in slip length ) . in the molecular dynamics simulations conducted here @xmath26",
    "was found to be 0.2 - 0.3 .    in any case",
    "our calculations here have demonstrated that in an incompressible newtonian fluid , changes in slip length can induce flow transverse to the walls in a nano or microfluidic channel .",
    "further our calculations suggest that these transverse flows are maximised if the patterning of slip takes place on a wavelength @xmath119 .",
    "thus it certainly appears that patterned slip could be used to induce mixing in the same way as patterned topography ( e.g. such as the asymmetric herringbone pattern studied in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ mixers ] suggests some possible patternings that could be used for mixing .",
    "however , we note that slip also changes the velocity profile in a channel ( e.g. see figure  [ patterned - slip ] ) . these changes in profile",
    "will no doubt alter the effect of dispersion on mixing in a channel . while our perturbative approach is not valid in the limit of large variations in slip - length which would be most effective for mixing",
    ", we would expect the flows to be qualitatively similar .",
    "cottin - bizonne et al @xcite have calculated effective slip - lengths in a half - plane geometry for flows over no - slip and partial or full slip patterned regions , although they have not examined how this alters the velocity profiles .",
    "we also note that surfaces with switchable wettability have recently been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this switchability suggests the interesting prospect of a slip length which is time and space dependent i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "the approach outlined in section 2 can easily be adapted to consider this situation .",
    "if we imagine a traveling wave variation in slip length @xmath121 , then in a frame comoving with this wave , the effects on the flow will appear similar to those of speeding up ( or slowing down ) the flow .",
    "thus the response of the fluid to a rapidly changing time - dependent slip will lag these changes in slip ( as the fluid response does for the fast moving flow in figure  [ ulag - plot ] ) .",
    "we will consider this problem in more detail in further work .",
    "we have considered the flow of a newtonian fluid in a channel with spatially varying surface properties . using a pertubative approach we derived equations that describe flow in a channel with patterned variations in slip length .",
    "we also examined flows in a channel with varying wettability using molecular dynamics .",
    "the simulations demonstrated that the variations in wettability induce variations in slip .",
    "good qualitative agreement was found between the molecular dynamics simulations and the approximate analysis of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the authors wish to acknowledge funding from the macdiarmid institute for advanced materials and nanotechnology .",
    "the authors would also like to thank cecile cottin - bizonne and catherine barentin for providing us with several useful references ."
