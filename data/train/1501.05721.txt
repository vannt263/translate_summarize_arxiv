    "some astronomers have discussed mir light variations .",
    "@xcite conducted surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ( sage ) of the large magellanic cloud with spitzer space telescope .",
    "@xcite detected many near - infrared ( nir ) and mir variable objects using the sage data taken over 3 months of difference in observing times . in the data ,",
    "a large fraction of the extreme asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars showed light variation .",
    "they also detected variable young stellar object ( yso ) candidates .",
    "@xcite reported dramatic mir flux decrease in young , sun - like star ( tyc 8241 2652 1 ) , using akari and wise data and by their own mir observations with thermal - region camera spectrograph at the gemini south telescope .",
    "they suggested that the reason for the large light variation is a disappearance of a warm , dusty circumstellar disk , but how the disk disappeared is currently not known .",
    "@xcite combined iras , two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and wise point source catalogs ( pscs ) and found an infrared variable source .",
    "based on the photometric characteristics of the object , they concluded that the object is likely to be a sakurai s object @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized previous studies of nir and mir variation in young stars and @xcite reviewed the researches of nir and mir variation in cataclysmic variables with spitzer space telescope data .    as described above , some papers that discussed mir light variations",
    "have been published .",
    "however , the number of papers discussing mir light variation is much smaller than that of papers on optical or nir light variations because accurate mir observation is rather difficult .",
    "we need to observe mir or far - infrared ( fir ) light variation for studying variations in circumstellar dust because the peak of dust emission is in mir or fir region . additionally , most of the previous works studied short - term light variations ( mainly using spitzer space telescope ) and selected targets by setting some selection criteria .",
    "for example , @xcite selected targets by 2mass and wise color .    in this paper ,",
    "we take advantage of the fact that iras , akari and wise performed all - sky surveys at similar wavelengths ( iras 12 , akari s9w , and wise w3 and iras 25 , akari l18w , and wise w4 , see figure [ fig : rc ] ) .",
    "we combined these pscs and searched the objects whose akari or wise mir fluxes had significantly increased from that of iras over the 20 - 30 years of difference in observing times .",
    "the aim of this study is to search sources that show significant mir brightenings , and to know what types of objects show mir large light variations and also to know why they show such large light variations .",
    "( 80mm,48mm)figure1a.eps ( 80mm,48mm)figure1b.eps",
    "at first , we merged akari / irc all - sky survey point source catalog ( version 1.0 , @xcite ) and wise all - sky data release @xcite with a tolerance angular radius of 5 arcsec . if more than one wise source were found , we regarded the closest one as the identical source .",
    "we call it akari - wise catalog .",
    "combining akari and wise pscs is necessary to ensure that the sources are securely detected by both akari and wise satellites .",
    "then , we cross - correlated iras psc , version 2.0 @xcite with the akari - wise catalog with a tolerance angular radius of 5 arcsec .",
    "the beam size of iras is about 10 times larger than those of akari and wise , making the choice of the tolerance radius difficult .",
    "if we apply a small radius , the number of the successful cross identification will be small .",
    "if we use a large radius , we will suffer from miss - identifications .",
    "we took 5 arcsec as a compromise size between these two problems .",
    "when we applied 5 arcsec as a tolerance radius , we did not find the source that had another sources within the tolerance radius .",
    "using the iras - akari - wise combined catalog , we chose our sample stars by following criteria .    1 .",
    "the flux density quality of iras at 12 @xmath1 or 25 @xmath1 should be 3 2 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of iras , akari and wise data should be better than 3 3 .",
    "declination of the sources are larger than so that they can be observed from northern hemisphere    the reason we set the criteria of the flux density quality of iras and",
    "the s / n of iras , akari and wise data is to discuss sources with significant flux increasing .",
    "the number of sources at each step of choosing our sample is shown in table [ tab : ns ] .    the flux density ratios between iras and akari or wise versus the numbers of sources with these flux density ratio are shown in figure [ fig : frh ] , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 means flux density . to select only the sources with strongest brightening",

    "@xmath7 3.16    these numbers were chosen rather arbitrary for this pilot study , so there is no physical meaning for the numbers . but as can be seen in figure [ fig : frh ] , the above criteria successfully chose sources showing the largest brightness changes .",
    "as a result , 4 sources were chosen . in the selection process",
    ", we did not apply color correction .    in this paper",
    ", we do not discuss the sources whose akari or wise s fluxes _ decreased _ from that of iras , because spatial resolution of iras is far worse than that of akari or wise . because of poor spatial resolution , it is possible that iras detected some point sources as one object which akari and wise were able to resolve . in such cases ,",
    "iras always overestimate fluxes compared to akari and wise .",
    "we chose 4 sources as our targets .",
    "the flux density ratios of these sources are shown in table [ tab : fr ] .",
    "basic information of them is shown in table [ tab : loo ] .",
    "no other sources are present within 5 arcsec around these 4 sources in iras catalog and akari - wise catalog . however , as we show later , one source ( iras  22343 + 7501 ) is resolved into 4 stars ( 2mass  j22352345 + 7517076 , 2mass  j22352442 + 7517037 , rd95  c , and 2mass  j22352497 + 7517113 ) by @xcite , @xcite , and our observation .",
    "these sources are too close to be detected individually by iras , akari , and wise .",
    "we made spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of our targets except for iras  22343 + 7501 , using all available data to date and also data from our observation ( see tables [ tab : iras19574]-[tab : v583cas ] ) .",

    "meanings of the shapes of marks are given in table [ tab : ps ] .",

    "this star is classified into a semiregular or an irregular variable by @xcite using nsvs @xcite data , and an irregular variable by aavso international variable star index vsx @xcite .",
    "the light curve of this star from nsvs catalog is shown in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "this star showed no discernible nir light variations from 2mass data .",
    "this star showed tio absorption features in optical and j - band spectra and co absorption features in h- and k - band .",
    "these features are typical of an m - type star s spectrum . additionally , we calculated reduced chi - squares by comparing this star s spectra with comparison stars spectra or model spectra ( see table [ tab : cs ] ) . when we calculated the reduced chi - squares , we interpolated the values of flux densities using cubic spline .",
    "the reduced chi - squares were calculated by the following formula , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of data points , @xmath10 is the flux density of a target s spectrum , and @xmath11 is the flux density of a comparison star s or model spectrum . the same calculation is done for v583  cas s spectra .",
    "these results suggest that this star is a relatively early m - type star .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this star is an m - type star .",
    "can this star be a nearby m - dwarf ? according to @xcite , absolute magnitude of the m0v is 5.99 , 5.32 , and 5.15 for j- , h- , and k - band respectively . by comparing these values with the 2mass magnitude ( table [ tab : pd ] ) , we can estimate its distance from the earth , and it is @xmath1210  pc . however , the proper motion of this star is very small ( @xmath1210  mas / yr , @xcite ) , and this contradicts any close distance .",
    "therefore , the star is likely to be more distant and hence could be an evolved star .",
    "additionally , this star is not a member of known star forming regions .",
    "therefore , this star is probably an agb star .",
    "few monitoring observations for agb stars in mir region have been conducted to date . from these observations ,",
    "the amplitudes of mira variables in mir are less than 1  mag @xcite .",
    "however , this star shows stronger brightening than 1  mag at 25   @xmath1 region , so we can not explain the reason for brightening just by pulsation .",
    "we infer that a large amount of mass loss of the central star is one possible reason for the brightening in mir .",
    "if mass loss rate increases an order of magnitude , we can explain brightening to several times , as we assume symmetric mass loss .",
    "the other possibility is that this star can be in a binary system .",
    "the light curve of this star in optical is similar to v  hya @xcite in terms of having two variability periods .",
    "v  hya is considered to be in a binary system .",
    "@xcite suggested that the shorter period of v  hya ( @xmath12530 days ) was due to pulsation and the longer period ( @xmath126000 days ) was due to extinction by circumstellar dust orbiting with the companion .",
    "although the periods of these two stars are different ( the periods of iras  19574 + 4941 are @xmath1260 days and 500 days ) , we can consider the possibility that this star is also in a binary system .",
    "also , if this star is in a binary system , we can consider other reasons for brightening in mir .",
    "one possible thing is eclipse , but it has a problem . if the longer period is due to eclipse , the amplitude in r - band ( @xmath120.7 mag ) is smaller than the brightening in mir . therefore , eclipse would not become main factor of brightening .",
    "another possible thing is mass transfer .",
    "when gas and dust accrete to companion , gravitational energy is released in the form of light . as a result , dust around the system absorbs the light and increases the amount of reradiation .",
    "anyway , it needs to confirm whether this star is in a binary system or not to explore the possibility of these things . however , it is difficult to confirm whether a red giant is in a binary system or not because we can not always distinguish orbital motion and pulsation .",
    "if the system has an accretion disk , then ultraviolet spectroscopy should reveal excess continuum or line emission from the accretion shock .",
    "( 160mm,96mm)figure13.eps      this star showed the strongest brightening in mir in our samples .",
    "interestingly , strong brightening was also seen in fir ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .    from previous works ,",
    "this star is considered a fu orionis star ( fuor , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a fuor is a kind of yso , which exhibit violent outburst because of a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate ( up to @xmath15 ) from the accretion disk around it @xcite . during the outbursts",
    ", these stars can increase the bolometric luminosity by two to three orders of magnitude .",
    "this star showed no discernible nir light variations from 2mass data .",
    "no variation in spectrum of this star from previous data ( e.g. @xcite ) was seen .",
    "the deep first overtone co absorption bands at 2.29 @xmath1 were seen , which is usually observed in the spectrum of fuor type star .",
    "several photometric monitorings for ysos in mir have been conducted to date .",
    "@xcite monitored ysos in orion nebula cluster and @xcite surveyed five evolved protoplanetary disks in the ic  348 cluster .",
    "they considered the reason for mir variability as mass accretion , flares , photospheric spots , or variable extinction .",
    "the amplitudes of these light variations are smaller than 1 mag and much smaller than that of v2494  cyg .",
    "@xcite reported multi - epoch mir observations of protostar lrll  54361 that exhibits by far the largest mir flux variability ( @xmath122.5 mag ) in ic  348 .",
    "this protostar showed periodic mir flux variation caused by pulsed accretion .",
    "large light variation in mir is also reported by @xcite .",
    "they reported multiwavelength observations of v2775  ori , a fuor type star , and strong brightening was also caused by increasing mass accretion . to cause such large light variation",
    ", it needs to change accretion rate dramatically .",
    "therefore , we think the reason mir flux was significantly increased is a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate .",
    "it caused brightening of the central star and dust around the star was heated rapidly .",
    "heated dust emits more mir flux .",
    "@xcite suggested that the increase in brightness was started in the early 1980s .",
    "our result indicates that this star started strong brightening between the time when iras and akari data were taken , restricting the epoch of brightening stronger ( after 1983 ) .",
    "significant light variation of fuors in optical wavelength was well known , but large light variation of mir and fir is rarely known .",
    "fuors are rarely detected because the brightening timescale of fuors ( from a few years to several decades ) is much shorter than the timescale between outbursts of the order of @xmath16 yr .",
    "wise w3 data showed strong brightening from iras 12 data .",
    "these stars are in cepheus flare region , a star - forming region .",

    "2mass  j22352345 + 7517076 showed significant light variations in h and k@xmath0-band .",
    "especially , it changed about 4 magnitudes in k@xmath0-band but usual agb stars do not show such large light variation in nir ( ita , in prep . ) .",
    "it supports the idea that this star is a yso .",
    "the spectrum of this star is nearly featureless and we can barely see co absorption features in k - band .",
    "it is probably due to significant excess emission from a disk of material that veils the stellar features .",
    "it also supports that this star is young star with a protoplanetary disk .",

    "dramatic brightening is seen in only wise data , so this brightening occurred between 2006 and 2009 . because 2mass  j22352345 + 7517076 showed significant light variations , this star probably related to the brightening in mir .",

    "@xcite classified this star into carbon star based on its red color .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite list this star as a carbon star",
    ". however , their data are not publicly available , so it is not possible to confirm the spectral type from previous classifications .",
    "this star also showed no discernible light variations from 2mass data . in the h - band spectrum of this star",
    ", we can see c@xmath17 ballik - ramsay system around 1.77  @xmath1 .",
    "it is typical of a carbon star s spectrum .",
    "in addition to this feature , we can see a weak feature around 1.52 @xmath1 . according to @xcite ,",
    "some carbon stars have an absorption band at 1.53 @xmath1 due to hcn and c@xmath17h@xmath17 .",
    "spectra of these stars show greatly weakened co absorption features and these stars are very red .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with this star ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "it also suggests that this star is a carbon star .",
    "hence , we conclude that this star is a carbon star .",
    "we can not see c@xmath17 ballik - ramsay system in the spectrum taken on 2013 august 22 .",
    "the reason is probably that absorption by terrestrial water vapor is stronger in summer than in autumn in japan .",
    "the wavelength of the feature is near band end of the h - band filter , so s / n tends to be worse compared to the other wavelengths .",
    "therefore , c@xmath17 ballik - ramsay system could have been obscured by noise , and that is why we could not see the feature .    as described for iras  19574 + 4941",
    ", we can not explain the significant brightening just by pulsation .",
    "therefore , additional mechanisms are needed to explain the mir brightening",
    ". however , observational data for this star are insufficient and we can not confirm the reason for brightening now .",
    "using iras , akari , and wise point source catalogs , we found that 4 sources ( iras  19574 + 491 , v2494  cyg , iras  22343 + 7501 , and v583  cas ) significantly brightened at mir wavelengths over the 20 - 30 years of difference in observing times . iras  22343 + 7501",
    "consists of 4 stars ( 2mass  j22352345 + 7517076 , 2mass  j22352442 + 7517037 , rd95  c , and 2mass  j22352497 + 7517113 ) and we obtained first jhk@xmath0 photometric data for all 4 sources .",
    "our spectroscopic observation reveals that two stars among the four are evolved stars ( one m - type star and one carbon star ) .",

    "<S> we present results of near - infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of mid - infrared ( mir ) sources that dramatically brightened . using iras , akari , and wise point source catalogs </S>",
    "<S> , we found that 4 sources ( iras  19574 + 491 , v2494  cyg , iras  22343 + 7501 , and v583  cas ) significantly brightened at mir wavelengths over the 20 - 30 years of difference in observing times . </S>",
    "<S> little is known about these sources except v2494  cyg , which is considered a fu orionis star . </S>",
    "<S> our observation clearly resolves iras  22343 + 7501 into 4 stars ( 2mass  j22352345 + 7517076 , 2mass  j22352442 + 7517037 , rd95  c , and 2mass  j22352497 + 7517113 ) and first jhk@xmath0 photometric data for all 4 sources are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> two of these stars ( 2mass  j22352442 + 7517037 and 2mass  j22352497 + 7517113 ) are known as t tau stars . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic observation reveals that iras  19574 + 9441 is an m - type evolved star and v583  cas is a carbon star . </S>",
    "<S> 2mass  j22352345 + 7517076 is probably a yso , judging from our observation that it has featureless near - infrared ( nir ) spectrum and also showed dramatic brightening in nir ( about 4 magnitudes in k@xmath0-band ) . </S>",
    "<S> the possible reasons for dramatic brightening in mir are discussed in this paper . </S>"
