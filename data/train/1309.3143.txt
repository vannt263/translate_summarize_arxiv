    "single - atom electron emitters are the closest one can get to the ideal of a point - like electron source .",
    "they are capable of producing beams with nearly full spatial coherence , i.e. approaching the heisenberg uncertainty limit @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the root - mean - square ( rms ) transverse beam size and @xmath2 the rms transverse momentum spread ; this was recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "currents in the range of tens of na can be generated in this way , resulting in ultra - bright electron beams .",
    "the fabrication of single - atom emitters , however , involves complicated preparation methods , usually based on the formation of a tiny protrusion on the apex of a 10100 nm hemispherical metallic tip @xcite .",
    "after proper treatment the protrusion forms a sharp structure with a single atom on top , which sprays a narrow beam of electrons when an external field is applied .",
    "new preparation methods have yielded relatively robust devices @xcite , but issues of stability , reproducibility and lifetime remain .    in the past few years , a new type of electron source has emerged , based on near - threshold photoionization of a laser - cooled and trapped atomic gas @xcite , which may provide an interesting alternative . in this ultracold source ,",
    "the atoms are suspended in vacuum , virtually motionless , and only emit an electron when triggered by light of the proper wavelength .",
    "they thus constitute an entire new class of single - atom emitters with unique properties : all emitters are exactly identical and reproducible ; emission is on demand , allowing ultrafast operation ; after emission the remaining ion is discarded , i.e. , each shot a fresh source is used and thus no ageing problems will occur ; many atoms may be ionized in parallel , the equivalent of an array of conventional single - atom emitters ; as will be discussed in more detail in this work , the combination of applied electric field strength and ionization wavelength enables precise tailoring of the emission angular spread and the virtual source size .    here",
    "we discuss a model of a single - alkali - atom emitter , freely suspended in vacuum , in terms of a theoretical description of the ionization process .",
    "the basis is the exactly solvable classical , non - relativistic model for ionization of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "we use a classical model , as the motion of a quasifree electron is reasonably well described by classical trajectories @xcite and we are not interested in interference effects , for which a full quantum wave - packet description is needed . recently",
    ", this model has been used to simulate images recorded with photoelectron imaging spectroscopy , a technique for studying the velocity and angular distribution of electrons created by photoionization @xcite .",
    "we expand on this description by deriving closed analytical expressions for the asymptotic transverse momentum distribution of the emitted electron beam and the virtual source size , in terms of the applied electric field strength and the ionization wavelength .",
    "the rms transverse momentum spread of the electrons @xmath2 determines the quality of the source ; for convenience this will be expressed in this work in terms of the effective transverse source temperature @xmath3 with @xmath4 the electron rest mass , @xmath5 the velocity spread of the electron bunch in the @xmath6-direction , and @xmath7 the boltzmann constant , although typically the velocities in the electron beam do not follow a maxwell  boltzmann distribution .",
    "we have used this model to explain experimental data of the effective source temperature of an ultracold electron source , based on photoionization of laser - cooled rubidium atoms @xcite .",

    "the analytical description of the electron velocities and trajectories strictly holds only for hydrogen atoms .",

    "[ sec : mod_rubidium_model ] we show by particle tracking simulations that the beam produced by near - threshold photoionization of rubidium atoms is accurately described by the hydrogen model as well .",

    "when this potential is used , all electrons can escape the ion .",
    "electrons with starting angle @xmath184 will escape the potential immediately ; electrons with @xmath185 will make recursions in the potential , until they scatter on the ion core .",
    "if due to this scattering event the angle between the velocity and the direction of acceleration is smaller than the critical angle , the electron will escape .",
    "an example of this is sketched in fig .",

    "is distributed over the same range as for @xmath184 , but there is no correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath43 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the scattering from @xmath188 to angles @xmath184 occurs randomly . for 151@xmath189",
    "no data points can be found .",
    "this is an artifact of the simulation conditions , in particular the choice for a cut - off radius at 1fm : the electrons in this range of angles move , at the start of the simulation , uphill in the potential and return to ( almost ) the same position as where they started from ; as they then come closer than 1fm to the centre of the core , they are removed from the simulation .     for @xmath190 , calculated with the rubidium model for @xmath44 5mev and @xmath18mv / m .",

    "orange dashed curve ) is shown for comparison.[fig : vr_rb_histogram ] ]    changing the parameters of the rb model potential has a negligible effect on the outcome of the simulations , as long as the potential resembles a @xmath193 potential for distances larger than tens of atomic units from the ion core , as it only changes the direction of the velocity of electrons with @xmath61 .",
    "for example setting @xmath194 and @xmath176 to zero , only increases the temperature for the standard simulation conditions with 0.3% .",
    "so far , we have assumed that in the ionization process all electrons gain the same energy , which is of course only true if the photoionization laser has a negligible spectral bandwidth . when an ultrafast laser pulse is used for ionization ,",
    "the spectral bandwidth has to be taken into account in calculating the effective source temperature and virtual source size , as then electrons with a substantial spread in excess energy are created . assuming that the number of created electrons is linear with ionization laser intensity , which has a gaussian profile as a function of wavelength , the excess energy distribution is also gaussian .",
    "the resulting temperature @xmath195 of such a pulse can be calculated by convoluting the theoretical curve @xmath196 from the analytical model with a gaussian distribution corresponding to the spectral bandwidth of the ultrashort ionization laser pulse , cut off at @xmath197mev , as for negative excess energies no electrons are created .",
    "this leads to @xmath198 with @xmath199 $ ] a normalized gaussian weight function , @xmath200 and @xmath201 the excess energy corresponding to the central wavelength and rms wavelength spread of the ionization laser pulse respectively , and normalization constant @xmath202 @xmath203 \\right ) \\right]$ ] , where erf is the error function .",
    "the source size can be calculated with an analogous equation .    in a recent experiment @xcite",
    ", electron bunches have been created with femtosecond laser pulses , with a wavelength around 480 nm and an rms bandwidth @xmath204 nm , so @xmath205mev .",
    "the model temperature for this spectral bandwidth is plotted with a dashed - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_vs_eexc_data_rb ] . for @xmath206mev ,",
    "when half of the energy in the ionization pulse can be used to create electrons , we find @xmath207k .",
    "this model for the source temperature in case of ultrashort photoionization agrees well with experimental data @xcite .",
    "we present an analytical model of an isolated single - atom electron source , based on a classical description of the motion of an electron in the potential of a singly charged ion and a uniform electric field used for acceleration .",
    "closed analytical expressions have been derived for the asymptotic transverse velocity distribution p@xmath208 , with which the effective source temperature @xmath209 was determined .",
    "we find that the potential acts as a bottleneck for the electrons , and that it reduces the transverse electron velocity for small excess energies .",
    "this leads to an effective source temperature that is much lower than expected on the basis of equipartition of the available energy . for small excess energies ,",
    "the temperature is largely independent of the acceleration field strength . for high excess energies ( @xmath137 )",
    ", the model curve follows the line @xmath210 .",
    "furthermore , closed analytical expressions have been derived for the asymptotic parabolic electron trajectories , with which the virtual source size can be calculated . by particle tracking simulations",
    ", it was concluded that for the resulting model temperature and source size , it does not matter whether a hydrogen or a rubidium potential is used in the calculations .",
    "this shows that the model is applicable to the ultracold electron source , which is based on photoionization of laser - cooled alkali atoms .",
    "we briefly discussed what the source characteristics are when ultrashort , broadband laser pulses are used for photoionization    for a specific electric field , we have indicated the conditions required for realizing a fully coherent beam , only limited by the heisenberg uncertainty relation . in this limit , the classical model is no longer applicable , and the system has to be treated with quantum mechanics ; this is an interesting direction for further research .",
    "furthermore , we have restricted ourselves to the description of the transverse degree of freedom in this paper .",
    "this model could be extended to the longitudinal degree of freedom , i.e. to study the longitudinal momentum spread and pulse length .",
    "this research is supported by the dutch technology foundation stw , which is part of the netherlands organisation for scientific research ( nwo ) , and which is partly funded by the ministry of economic affairs .",
    "in a uniform electric field , the transverse electron velocity is given by @xmath141 , and the starting velocity in the longitudinal direction @xmath211 .",
    "for the electron s position , we find @xmath212 and @xmath213 . combining these yields @xmath214",
    ". we can rewrite this equation as the parabolic expression @xmath215 , from which we find @xmath216",
    "the virtual source size is determined by extrapolating the asymptotic particle trajectories back to the source : where the lines cross , a virtual beam waist is formed , which usually does not coincide with the actual position of the source .",
    "the virtual source size is defined as the size of this virtual beam waist . for acceleration in a uniform electric field , as discussed in this paper , the asymptotic particle trajectories are parabolas .",
    "consequently , the slopes of the tangents of the particle trajectories , which should be extrapolated back to the source to determine the virtual source size , depend on longitudinal position .",
    "in fact , if the vertex of the asymptotic parabolic trajectory lies at ( @xmath217 , @xmath218 ) and the slope of tangent is evaluated at @xmath219 , then the extrapolated lines will cross exactly at ( @xmath217 , @xmath220 ) , independent of the curvature of the parabola . by definition @xmath220",
    "is then the position of the virtual source .",
    "however , the relevant quantity is the size of the virtual source , not its position .",
    "the size is determined by the distribution of points where the extrapolated tangents , determined at @xmath219 , of all possible asymptotic parabolic trajectories cross .",
    "if the vertex of the asymptotic parabolic trajectory lies at ( @xmath221 , @xmath95 ) , then the tangents will cross at ( @xmath222 , @xmath223 ) .",
    "the points constituting the virtual source therefore have exactly the same distribution in the @xmath6-direction as the distribution of vertex points , translated over a longitudinal distance @xmath224 .",
    "consequently , the virtual source size is identical to the effective transverse source size .",
    "if we would define a longitudinal virtual source size , it would be twice the effective longitudinal source size .",
