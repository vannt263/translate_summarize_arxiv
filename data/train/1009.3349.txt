    "( [ eqn2 ] ) the resulting cluster state equations are ,    @xmath138    where the arrow again represents the limit @xmath139 . in the undepleted regime and in the limit of infinite ( or large ) squeezing these equations are equivalent to eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) under certain mode rotations .",
    "specifically , if we rotate modes 5 and 6 by @xmath140 by substituting @xmath141 and @xmath142 the equivalence can be seen @xcite .",
    "hence , by simply verifying that the squeezed joint quadrature operators approach zero in the limit @xmath139 , we can determine whether or not the proposed scheme gives rise to a cluster state .",
    "as an aside , we actually calculate the variances of the squeezed operators of eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) , and ensure that these approach zero , as these are the quantities we have access to in our simulations .",
    "we first confirm that the squeezed operators approach zero as expected @xcite in the undepleted case . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we calculate the squeezed operators from the heisenberg equations ( solid lines ) . we see that @xmath143 and @xmath144 and both sets of operators approach zero as @xmath133 approaches infinity .",
    "therefore , the cluster state equation is confirmed in the undepleted regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we also plot the squeezed operators calculated from the positive-@xmath0 equations in the absence of an optical cavity ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we note that the positive-@xmath0 results go to zero but start to increase from zero at longer times .",
    "moreover , as @xmath145 approaches zero , @xmath146 increases and does not approach zero . for the cluster state relation to be satisfied , all squeezing operators must approach zero simultaneously . as seen here",
    "this is not the case , except at around @xmath147 for the system considered , and hence the required cluster state condition is only partially satisfied once depletion is included .",
    "thus , depletion alone is enough to inhibit cluster state formation .",
    ", in the undepleted pump approximation ( black solid lines ) and positive-@xmath0 results without a cavity ( colored dashed lines ) .",

    "[ fig11 ] we plot the squeezing operators for the full interaction hamiltonian in the presence of a cavity , based on positive-@xmath0 simulations .",
    "this result is more relevant to the scheme that would be realized in the proposed experiment . unlike the undepleted case , the squeezing operators calculated in this case do not approach zero . instead , the squeezed operators plateau at non - zero values in the steady - state .",
    "we find that the decay of the squeezed joint operators is in fact quite minimal ( of order 20% ) .",
    "this indicates that generating a cluster state from the output of a single opo may present a challenge .    ,",

    "we have examined an experimentally feasible quadruply concurrent intracavity scheme as proposed in refs . @xcite .",
    "we investigated this system as a potential source of cv quadripartite entanglement and as a candidate for the generation of a cv square - cluster state .",
    "we verified the presence of quadripartite entanglement via optimized versions of the well - known vlf correlations .",
    "the proposed scheme provided a source of bright entangled output beams above the critical pumping threshold when an injected signal was incorporated into the analysis .",
    "below threshold we also detected quadripartite entanglement with the maximum entanglement predicted near threshold .",
    "we have also calculated the squeezed joint operators to determine if the state produced by the proposed scheme is a cv cluster state . within the undepleted pump approximation",
    ", we confirmed that the squeezed joint operators approached zero in the limit of large squeezing .",
    "however , in our analysis of the more experimentally realistic case where depletion is present and a cavity is used to house the nonlinear media , we did not observe that the squeezing operators approached zero as required by the cluster state defining relation .",
    "furthermore , including depletion alone was sufficient to inhibit cluster state formation and once the cavity was also included the decay of the squeezing operators was found to be minimal .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the utility of this system as a source of cluster states depends on the degree to which less than perfect squeezing is acceptable .",
    "overall , solution of the undepleted heisenberg equations of motion can only be used as a general guide to the performance of such a system once it is placed inside an optical cavity . without the cavity",
