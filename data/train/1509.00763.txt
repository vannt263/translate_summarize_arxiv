    "in this paper we will state and give a proof of a 2-dimensional analogue of the birkhoff theorem from universal algebra . recall that in the ordinary setting , birkhoff s theorem characterises equationally defined subcategories of algebraic categories .",
    "consider a category @xmath0 of algebras for a strongly finitary monad @xmath1 .",
    "( note that a monad is strongly finitary if its underlying functor is strongly finitary , i.  e. , if it preserves sifted colimits . )",
    "a full subcategory @xmath2 of @xmath0 is said to be _ equationally defined _ if it is ( equivalent to ) the category @xmath3 of algebras for a strongly finitary monad @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is constructed by `` adding new equations '' to the theory @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we ask @xmath4 to be a quotient of @xmath1 , meaning that there is a monad morphism @xmath5 that is moreover a regular epimorphism .",
    "the resulting algebraic functor @xmath6 then exhibits @xmath3 as an equationally defined full subcategory of @xmath0 .",
    "every such subcategory @xmath7 has nice closure properties with respect to to the inclusion into @xmath0 .",
    "the content of birkhoff s theorem is that equationally defined subcategories can moreover be characterised by these closure properties .",
    "in essence , this theorem holds since algebraic categories are well - behaved with respect to quotients ( regular epis )  they are _ exact categories _  @xcite .",
    "taking inspiration from the ordinary case , we want to give a characterisation of equationally defined subcategories of algebraic categories in the enriched setting .",
    "namely , we shall mainly work with categories enriched in the symmetric monoidal closed category @xmath8 and we will accordingly use the enriched notions of a functor , natural transformation , etc .",
    "analogously to the ordinary case , in defining the notion of an equationally defined subcategory of @xmath0 the idea is again to consider `` quotients '' @xmath5 of strongly finitary 2-monads .",
    "any subcategory @xmath9 exhibited by a quotient @xmath5 is equationally defined in @xmath0 .    unlike in the @xmath10 case , it is not immediately clear that some well - behaved notion of a quotient of strongly finitary 2-monads should exist . in @xmath10 ,",
    "the quotients come as the epi part of the ( regular epi , mono ) factorisation system , and they are computed as certain colimits , the coequalisers .",
    "the solution in @xmath8 is to mimic this approach .",
    "thus we should study factorisation systems on @xmath11 ( and the respective notions of a quotient ) , and find out which factorisation systems `` lift up '' from the category @xmath11 to @xmath11-enriched algebraic categories .",
    "that is , we want to find factorisation systems that render the algebraic categories over @xmath11 _ exact _ in some suitably generalised sense .",
    "this would allow us to talk about quotients of strongly finitary 2-monads while preserving the good behaviour of quotients as in @xmath11 .",
    "recent advances in the theory of 2-dimensional exactness ( see  @xcite ) show that there are at least three notions of a quotient coming from three factorisation systems @xmath12 on @xmath11 , for which algebraic categories over @xmath11 are exact :    1 .",
    "( surjective on objects , injective on objects and fully faithful ) , 2 .",
    "( bijective on objects , fully faithful ) , 3 .",
    "( bijective on objects and full , faithful ) .",
    "( for the @xmath13 parts of the above systems , we will use the standard abbreviations , namely s.o .  for surjective on objects , b.o .  for bijective on objects , and  b.o",
    "full for bijective on objects and full . )",
    "one of the results of  @xcite states that the 2-category @xmath14 of strongly finitary 2-monads over @xmath11 is _ exact _ in the sense of  @xcite w.r.t .",
    "all the three factorisation systems above .",
    "we focus on the factorisation system ( b.o .",
    "full , faithful ) .",
    "unlike the other two systems , it corresponds to a meaningful notion of an equationally defined subcategory , and it allows to prove the 2-dimensional birkhoff theorem by arguments very similar to those contained in the proof of the ordinary birkhoff theorem . for this factorisation system",
    ", the exactness of @xmath14 implies that a monad morphism @xmath5 is a quotient if and only if @xmath15 is a b.o .",
    "full functor in @xmath11 for every category @xmath16 .",
    "we shall often use this `` pointwise '' nature of quotient monad morphisms .",
    "the main result of the paper characterises `` equational subcategories '' of algebraic categories as those that are closed under products , quotients , subalgebras and sifted colimits .",
    "this is a characterisation precisely in the spirit of the ordinary birkhoff theorem . in the ordinary setting",
    ", only the first three closure properties are demanded , and are dubbed `` hsp '' conditions .",
    "however , even in the ordinary case , it was found out that closure under _ filtered _ colimits was necessary when dealing with the many - sorted case  @xcite .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the additional requirement of closure under _ sifted _ colimits is needed in the 2-dimensional case : the _ finitary _ and _ strongly finitary _",
    "2-monads no longer coincide in @xmath11 , and we are dealing with the strongly finitary ones .",
    "the choice of working with strongly finitary 2-monads is fairly natural , since the 2-category @xmath14 is equivalent to the 2-category @xmath17 of @xmath11-enriched one - sorted algebraic theories ( also dubbed _",
    "lawvere 2-theories _ )  @xcite .    in the final section",
    "we conclude with a few remarks on possible future work and on the other two factorisation systems on @xmath11 .",
    "these systems are much worse behaved , and thus the corresponding birkhoff - type theorem would be of a weaker nature .",
    "we shall make heavy use of factorisation systems in discussing and proving the birkhoff theorem .",
    "the study of factorisation systems in general 2-categories is much more involved than in the ordinary case . following the exposition in  @xcite",
    ", we first recall the definitions of _ enriched _ orthogonality in a general @xmath18-category for a symmetric monoidal closed base category @xmath18 . then we introduce _ kernel - quotient systems _ that generalise the correspondence between regular epimorphisms and kernels in exact categories , and we use this notion to introduce three well - behaved factorisation systems on @xmath11 .

    "we denote this fact by @xmath26 .",
    "we examine when two morphisms @xmath19 and @xmath21 are orthogonal in @xmath20 for the case of @xmath8 .",

    "we can conclude that the ordinary equivalence @xmath346 is enriched in @xmath11 , thus finishing the proof .",
    "a point that needs to be discussed is that we demand closure of @xmath2 under sifted colimits in @xmath0 in the characterisation of equationally defined subcategories of @xmath0 .",
    "it is true that in the original birkhoff theorem there is no need to demand closure under any class of colimits whatsoever .",
    "however , even in the ordinary case of @xmath10 , closure under filtered ( or directed ) colimits is essential in the case of many - sorted universal algebra , see  @xcite . in the case of @xmath8 , at least the requirement for closure under filtered colimits is arguably expectable .",
    "the reason why our version of the birkhoff theorem asks for an even stronger closure property , i.e. , closure under _ sifted _ colimits is the following . while finitary and strongly finitary monads on @xmath48 coincide ( every finitary monad is strongly finitary ) , this is not the case for 2-monads on @xmath11 : a finitary 2-monad need not be strongly finitary .",
    "for example , the 2-monad @xmath1 that gives rise to the 2-category @xmath0 of categories @xmath20 equipped with one `` arrow - ary '' operation @xmath357 is finitary , but @xmath1 fails to preserve sifted colimits in general . since we are dealing with _ strongly finitary _",
    "2-monads on @xmath11 , the corresponding closure property is the closure under _ sifted _ colimits .    in the ordinary setting ,",
    "full algebraic subcategories induced by a quotient monad morphism can be characterised as a special kind of orthogonal subcategories . without substantial changes to the reasoning ,",
    "the same characterisation can be obtained for the case of @xmath8 , as it is shown in the following remark .",
    "given a 2-category @xmath164 and a set @xmath358 of morphisms of @xmath164 , we will denote by @xmath359 the full subcategory @xmath360 spanned by the objects @xmath361 that are orthogonal to all morphisms in @xmath362 .",
    "the full equationally defined subcategories @xmath363 of the 2-category @xmath0 of algebras for a strongly finitary 2-monad @xmath1 are precisely the orthogonal subcategories of @xmath0 of the form @xmath364 for some set @xmath151 of quotient morphisms in @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , each morphism in @xmath151 has as its domain a free algebra on a finite discrete category .    to see",
    "that one direction of this statement holds , observe that @xmath2 is closed under subobjects in @xmath0 : given an algebra @xmath244 in @xmath2 and its subalgebra @xmath243 , we have for any @xmath365 a situation @xmath366{f } \\dar[swap]{g } & ( c , c ) \\dar[dotted ] \\dlar[swap , dotted ] \\\\ ( a , a ) \\rar[>- > , swap]{g } & ( b , b ) \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] where the morphism @xmath367 exists since @xmath368 , and the diagonal exists by the diagonal property of the factorisation system .",
    "closure of @xmath2 under 2-products in @xmath0 follows easily from the universal property of 2-products . to show that @xmath2 is closed under quotients in @xmath0 ,",
    "observe first that @xmath369 preserves quotient maps .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath370 holds , and both @xmath343 and @xmath371 are easily seen to preserve quotient maps .",

    "the composite @xmath377 then proves that @xmath368 .",
    "indeed , given any other factorisation @xmath378 , it holds that @xmath379 since @xmath23 is epi .",
    "the closure of @xmath2 under sifted colimits follows from observing that @xmath369 preserves sited colimits .",
    "this is the case since both @xmath371 and @xmath343 preserve sifted colimits .    in the other direction ,",
    "recall that reflective subcategories are _ always _ orthogonality classes . in our case",
    "we have that @xmath380 we need to take a subset of the above class of morphisms such that the codomain of each morphism is a free algebra on a finite discrete category . for this , we use that every algebra @xmath243 is a sifted colimit of free algebras on finite discrete categories .",
    "now as the orthogonal lifting property is closed under colimits in the category of arrows , we get that @xmath381 is equal to the subcategory @xmath382 as we needed .",
    "in this section we first discuss possible directions for future work .",
    "then we conclude by showing that the kernel - quotient systems @xmath85 and @xmath90 are inadequate for obtaining any kind of a strong birkhoff - type theorem .      in classical universal algebra",
    ", it is known that there is an _ equational logic _ that is sound and complete with respect to the notion of _ equational consequence_. see section  3.2.4 of  @xcite for a nice treatment .",
    "an obvious question is whether there is an `` equational logic '' sound and complete with respect to the notion of equational consequence that comes from our definition of what equation is in the 2-dimensional context .",
    "finding such a calculus is a problem for future work .",
    "we can see immediately that the situation is very different in the case of the ( b.o .",
    ", f.f . ) factorisation system when compared to the ( b.o .",
    "full , faithful ) case . given a monad morphism @xmath248 with @xmath383 being b.o .  for all categories",
    "@xmath58 , the algebraic functor @xmath384 need not be fully faithful in the 2-dimensional sense .",
    "this calls for a different approach to stating and proving a birkhoff - style theorem . indeed , trying to mimic the case of the ( b.  .o .",
    "full , faithful ) factorisation system breaks down at the very beginning : we will not be able to characterise `` equational '' subcategories by their closure properties , as the subcategories need not be full .",
    "even more goes wrong : not every b.o .",
    "functor is epimorphic in @xmath11 , and @xmath11 is not cowellpowered with respect to b.o",
    ".  quotients .",
    "recall from remark  [ rem : alg - meaning - ptwise ] that a b.o .",
    "full quotient @xmath128 has the components @xmath129 pointwise b.o .",
    "full in @xmath11 .",
    "algebraically , this specifies new equations that have to hold between morphisms in a @xmath385-algebra .",
    "however , no such algebraic meaning can be given in the case of a b.o .",
    "quotient @xmath128 .",
    "this is because the components @xmath129 are pointwise _ only b.o . _ in @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath4 as a monad may contain new 2-dimensional algebraic information , and in this context it does not make sense to talk about @xmath3 as of an `` equational '' subcategory of @xmath0 .",
    "the same remarks remain true when considering the ( s.o .",
