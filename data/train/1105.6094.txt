    "the subsequent evolution of the disc proceeds in several stages .",
    "two different scenarios have been proposed to explain the formation of kilometre - sized planetesimals .    1 .",
    "one process is the gravitational instability of the dust component in a protoplanetary disc that leads to the direct formation of larger bodies .",
    "@xcite propose that an initial growth phase of dust grains leads to a thin dust disc that undergoes a gravitational collapse .",
    "as the dense dust layer decouples from the gas , it rotates with the local keplerian velocity , whereas the gas component rotates slower as it is partially pressure supported .",
    "this gives rise to a velocity shear at the boundary , which may excite turbulence through the kelvin - helmholtz - instability .",
    "since the motion of small dust grains in the boundary layer is coupled to the gas , the turbulent velocity field could suppress the formation of a stratified dust layer , which is a necessary prerequisite for the gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "the collisional agglomeration of dust particles is an opposed formation mechanism .",
    "relative velocities are dominated by the brownian motion in the early phases of the growth process .",
    "this mechanism becomes increasingly inefficient with growing mass , but successively the particles decouple from the gas and settle to the midplane  a process that yields even larger velocities with increasing mass .",
    "the sedimentation initiates a growth mode that is similar to the processes in rain clouds : larger grains drop faster , thus accreting smaller grains on their way to the midplane .",
    "turbulence may modify this basic growth scenario by forcing the dust grains in a convection - like motion .",
    "dust grains still grow during the settling process , but the turbulent velocity field could mix up dust from the midplane , and a new cycle begins .",
    "each cycle adds a new layer to the dust grains  a mechanism that also operates in hail clouds  until the grains are large enough to decouple from the turbulent motion .",
    "again , turbulence plays an important role in determining the growth mode and the relative velocities .",
    "while the relative velocities are high enough to allow for a fast growth , it is not clear _ a priory _ that collisions are sticky enough to allow for a net growth .",
    "high speed encounters lead to fragmentation , which counteracts agglomeration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "an important bottleneck in the agglomeration process is the fast orbital decay of 1  m  sized boulders .",
    "their orbital lifetime is as short as 100 years , and a quick increase in size  at least over one order of magnitude  is needed to reduce the radial drift significantly .    to overcome the difficulties associated with each of these scenarios ,",
    "modifications have been proposed .",
    "magneto - hydrodynamic simulations include electro - magnetic interactions in hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "see the reviews of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mhd simulations by @xcite show that trapping of larger particles in turbulent vortices helps in increasing the orbital lifetime , but could also trigger local instabilities that may lead to the direct formation of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "@xcite describe a gravoturbulence mechanism as a feasible pathway to planetesimal formation in accreting circumstellar discs .",
    "the details of agglomeration have drawn a lot of attention and are still under question ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the successive agglomeration of planetesimals is commonly accepted .",
    "the further growth of planetesimals proceeds through mutual collisions , where the initial phase involves a large number of particles and is well described by a coagulation equation @xcite .",
    "while earlier works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) focussed mainly on the evolution of the size distribution , subsequent refinements of the evolution of the random velocities showed that it is important to evolve the size distribution and the velocity dispersion in a consistent way .",
    "a fixed velocity dispersion is an oversimplification , which changes the growth mode and increases the growth timescale as well @xcite .",
    "the initial growth is quite democratic .",
    "all planetesimals grow roughly at the same rate and the maximum of the size distribution is shifted gently towards larger sizes .",
    "as soon as gravitational focusing and dynamical friction become important , the growth mode changes to a qualitatively different mechanism .",
    "efficient gravitational focusing leads to a growth timescale ( which we denote as @xmath6 ) that decreases with mass .",
    "hence larger bodies grow faster than the smaller planetesimals , a trend that is further supported by energy equipartition due to planetesimal  planetesimal encounters .",
    "this dynamical friction keeps the largest bodies on nearly circular orbit , thus the relative velocities are small and gravitational focusing remains efficient .",
    "smaller planetesimals are stirred up into eccentricity orbits , which slows down their growth rate compared to the largest bodies .",
    "this accelerated growth , denoted as runaway growth of planetesimals ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shortens the growth timescale to a few @xmath7  years .",
    "the term runaway growth stresses that the growth timescale of a particle decreases with mass , hence the largest body `` runs away '' to the high mass end of the distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "while energy equipartition increases the velocity dispersion with decreasing mass of the planetesimals , additional damping due to the gaseous disc leads to a turn - over at smaller sizes .",
    "however , higher relative velocities may lead nevertheless to destructive encounters , but these fragmentation events could even speed up the growth @xcite . since smaller bodies are more subjected to gas drag ,",
    "their velocity dispersion is smaller which allows an efficient accretion by the runaway bodies .",
    "moreover , smaller particles damp the velocity dispersion of the largest bodies more efficiently .",
    "as runaway proceeds , the system becomes more and more dominated by few big bodies  the protoplanets . due to the dominance of few , very large bodies one can not use statistical methods anymore to simulate the problem .",
    "@xcite derived analytical expressions for the final masses of these planetary `` embryos '' , as they call them , including the role of planetesimal depletion due to collisional disruption .",
    "they conclude that the final mass in the minimum - mass solar nebula at several au can achieve @xmath8 earth mass within @xmath9 years .",
    "the runaway growth of large bodies ( i.e. protoplanets ) ceases to be efficient as soon as the protoplanets start to control the velocity dispersion of the remaining planetesimals in their vicinity .",
    "gravitational focusing becomes less effective , therefore the growth timescale increases with size and the growth mode changes to oligarchic growth .",
    "the protoplanets still grow faster than the field planetesimals , but the masses of the protoplanets remain comparable .",
    "a combination of dynamical friction due to the field planetesimals and perturbations from the neighbouring protoplanets conserves a separation of five to ten hill radii between neighbouring bodies .",
    "therefore only planetesimals from a limited area , the feeding zone , are accreted by a given protoplanet .",
    "if this zone is emptied , they have reached their final isolation mass @xcite .    as the damping of the remaining field planetesimals is weak enough ,",
    "further growth is dominated by mutual perturbations among the protoplanets , which leads to giant impacts .",
    "protoplanets beyond the `` snow line '' ( or ice condensation point ) can grow larger than 515 earth masses and initiate the formation of giant planets .",
    "if the protoplanetary disc is very massive in the inner planetary system , this may lead to an in - situ formation of hot jupiters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the oligarchic growth model of protoplanets to statistically quantify the giant impact stage ( i.e. collisions of protoplanets to form planets ) with @xmath0body simulations .",
    "they found that for steeper surface density profiles , large planets usually form closer to the star .",
    "the proposed three - stage scenario of planet formation covers the dominant growth processes , but a major mechanism is still missing  the migration of bodies in the system .",
    "migration is a generic term that summarises a set of different mechanisms that lead to secular radial drift of bodies ( see e.g. the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    1 .",
    "the dissipation due to the remaining gas disc leads to an orbital decay of the planetesimals . while this poses a severe problem for 1 m ",
    "sized objects , larger bodies drift very slowly inward .",
    "one denotes this process as type 0 migration .",
    "planets which are embedded in a gaseous disc launch spiral density waves at the inner and outer lindblad resonances , which leads to an exchange of angular momentum with the resonant excited waves .",
    "this type i migration leads to a robust inward migration independent of the density profile .",
    "the perturbation from the planet is small , hence linear perturbation theory is in principle applicable @xcite , but recent work proves that non - linear and radiative effects can be quite important @xcite .",
    "if the protoplanet is massive enough , it opens a gap in the gaseous disc and excites waves through tidal interaction with the gaseous disc .",
    "an imbalance of the exchange of angular momentum with the inner and outer part of the disc leads to type ii migration .",
    "the strong interaction between planet and disc leaves the linear regime and requires a numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "4 .   even with an opened gap , the planet still channels gas between the inner and outer part of the disc .",
    "while this corotational flow is to some extent already present during type ii migration , it dominates the angular momentum balance in the case of type iii migration due to an asymmetry in the leading and trailing part of the flow .",
    "an imbalance allows for an efficient exchange of angular momentum with this corotational gas stream , which gives rise to a remarkably fast migration @xcite .",
    "type iii migration is subjected to a positive feedback : a faster migration increases the asymmetry in the corotational flow , which speeds up the migration .",
    "both inward and outward migration are possible .",
    "the four migration types modify the three - stage scenario in different ways .",
    "+ _ type 0 _ migration is most efficient for small planetesimals ( i.e. 1 km or smaller ) .",
    "it poses a severe problem during the early stages of planet formation , as it may induce a significant loss of solid material , accompanied by a global change in the initial surface density @xcite .",
    "the importance of this process diminishes as planetesimal growth proceeds , but it still leads to the loss of collisional fragments during the final disc clearing .",
    "+ _ type i _ is most important for protoplanets ( i.e. 0.1 earth masses or larger ) .",
    "it leads to an orbital decay of protoplanets , but this does not only imply a loss of protoplanets , but also breaks the conditions for isolation .",
    "migrating bodies can accrete along their way through the disc and are thus not constrained to a fixed feeding zone , which may increase the isolation mass .",
    "+ _ type ii _ and _ type iii _ mainly influences giant planets ( larger than 10 earth masses ) causing an inward or outward migration , depending on the angular momentum exchange balance .",
    "it can explain the large number of giant planets close to their host star ( hot jupiters ) found in extrasolar systems .",
    "an important issue is the timescale of the migration process .",
    "if the migration is too fast , virtually all planets spiral inward and leave an empty system behind .",
    "migration is a powerful process with the capability to reshape an entire planetary system , at least for gas giants , since terrestrial planets are likely not affected by migration in gaseous discs @xcite",
    ". however , it also requires some `` parking mechanism '' which terminates migration before all planets ( or protoplanets ) are lost .",
    "inhomogeneities in the gaseous disc may change the crucial momentum balance of the inner and outer part of the disc , thus stalling or even reversing the drift of a planet .",
    "the migration processes end after the dissipation of the gaseous disc due to photoevaporation or star - star encounters ( i.e. after a few @xmath5 to @xmath9 years ) .",
    "the formation of a planetary system is a vital process that is driven by the interplay between the different growth phases and the migration of planets and protoplanetary cores ( i.e. the precursors of giant planets ) .",
    "while the preceding sections only summarised the main evolutionary processes , even more processes could influence the formation of planetary systems .",
    "a fast accretion of giant planets in the outer parts of a planetary system could introduce further perturbations on the inner part and may even trigger the formation of terrestrial planets .",
    "moreover , the stellar environment in dense star clusters and multiple stellar systems also perturbs planet formation , which would require an even broader view on the problem .",
    "last but not least , the excitation due to gravitational coupling to gas surface density fluctuations plays an important role ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "any approach to planet formation can hardly include this wealth of different phenomena , thus it is important to focus on a well - defined subproblem . in this work we focus on the formation of protoplanets for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the size , growth timescale and spacing of the protoplanets is a key element in the planet formation process .",
    "the protoplanet growth is well - defined by different growth modes .",
    "it starts with the already formed planetesimals ( @xmath10@xmath11 km ) and ends , when orbital crossing of the protoplanets initiates the final growth phase .",
    "the planetesimals are large enough to treat the remaining gaseous disc as a small perturbation .",
    "the protoplanets are small enough to neglect tidal interaction with the disc in the inner planetary system .",
    "collective planetesimal ",
    "protoplanet interaction are also negligible .",
    "though the protoplanet formation is a well - posed subproblem , our approach has to incorporate various mechanisms and techniques to cover the full size range of the problem ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* for a extensive review of the problem and references therein ) . however , it is still accessible to theoretical calculations to some extent which provide a safe ground for the analysis of the results .    in next section [ theory ]",
    "we briefly summarise the analytical model that we use for our initial models .",
    "then we introduce the problem that we will address later , as well as the timescales and quantities of interest for the general problem of planetesimal formation : in sections [ keplerorb ] , [ hillprob ] , [ protogrowth ] we give a description for a test particle moving around a body with a central mass @xmath12 , the hill s problem and the protoplanet growth from a theoretical point of view , respectively .",
    "subsequently , in section [ integrator ] and its corresponding subsections , we ascertain the direct - summation part of the general algorithm , as well as the required modifications and additions to tailor it to the specific planetesimal problem . in section [ collmodel ]",
    "we introduce our collisional treatment , including fragmentation , collisional cascades , migration and coagulation .",
    "the statistical part of the algorithm is described in detail in section [ statmodel ] .",
    "finally , in section [ hybridcode ] we explain how to bring together both schemes into a single numerical tool and in section [ discussion ] we give our conclusions and compare our scheme to other numerical approaches .",
    "the basis for all planet formation models is the structure of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "we summarise the pioneering work of @xcite to have a robust initial model at hand .",
    "subsequent evolution of the disc may change this simple approach , but it is still a valuable guideline .",
    "a basic estimate of the minimum surface density of solid material in the disc can be deduced from the mass and location of the present planets in the solar system : @xmath13 the discontinuity at 2.7 au stems from the location of the ice condensation point ( or snow line ) that allows the formation of icy grains in the outer solar system .",
    "furthermore , the total surface density is estimated through the chemical composition of the disc , which gives the ratio of gas to solids .",
    "a fiducial value is 1:0.017 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the surface density of the gas component is therefore : @xmath14 since the dust content is rather low , the gaseous component is transparent to the visible solar radiation",
    ". thus the gas temperature follows from the radiation balance : @xmath15 @xmath16 is the solar luminosity during the early stages , normalised by the present value @xmath17 .",
    "the three - dimensional density structure is given by an isothermal profile @xmath18 with a radially changing scale height @xmath19 : @xmath20 @xmath21 is the sound velocity of an ideal gas with a mean molecular weight @xmath22 in units of the hydrogen mass @xmath23 .",
    "since the density profile is related to a radially varying pressure , the gas velocity deviates from the local keplerian velocity .",
    "the balance of forces relates the angular velocity @xmath24 to the pressure gradient : @xmath25 thus the angular velocity @xmath24 of the gas is ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath26 it is more appropriate to formulate the rotation of the gaseous disc in terms of a velocity lag @xmath27 normalised to the local keplerian velocity @xmath28 : @xmath29 a typical value of @xmath27 for the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 au is @xmath30 m@xmath31s .",
    "this simple model provides a brief description of the initial disc .",
    "however , the subsequent evolution further modifies the structure of the protoplanetary disc . since embedded dust grains",
    "are coupled to the gas , it is likely that a global migration of solid material changes the surface density . moreover ,",
    "the dust grains are chemically processed , depending on the local temperature and composition which introduces additional spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "when the growing particles pass the critical size of @xmath32 metre , the strong onset of radial migration may lead to a final reshaping of the distribution of solid material . while these restrictions weaken the validity of this approach as the `` true '' initial model",
    ", it is still a robust guideline to choose reasonable surface densities for the solid and the gaseous component after the formation of planetesimals .",
    "planetesimals in a protoplanetary disc are subjected to various perturbations : close encounters change their orbits , a small but steady gas drag gives rise to a radial drift and accretion changes the mass of the planetesimals .",
    "while all theses processes drive the disc evolution on a timescale of at least a few thousand years , each planetesimal moves most of the time on an orbit close to an unperturbed kepler ellipse . though the protoplanetary disc introduces additional perturbations , the central potential dominates for typical disc masses around @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the classical orbital elements still provide a proper framework to study planetesimal dynamics .",
    "the orbital elements of a test particle moving around a mass @xmath12 are :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36 is the semimajor axis , @xmath37 is the eccentricity and @xmath38 is the inclination of the orbit .",
    "as long as no dominant body is structuring the protoplanetary disc , it is justified to assume axisymmetry .",
    "hence the argument of the perihelion @xmath39 , the longitude of the ascending node @xmath40 and the eccentric anomaly @xmath41 are omitted in the statistical description .",
    "the deviation of planetesimal orbits from a circle is quite small .",
    "thus it is appropriate to expand the above set of equations .",
    "a planetesimal at a distance @xmath42 , in a distance @xmath43 above the midplane and with a velocity @xmath44 with respect to the local circular velocity @xmath28 has orbital elements ( leading order only ) : @xmath45 these expressions allow us later a convenient transformation between the statistical representation through orbital elements and the utilisation of a velocity distribution function .",
    "when two planetesimals pass close by each other , they exchange energy and angular momentum and separate with modified orbital elements .",
    "successive encounters transfer energy between planetesimals with different masses , driving an evolution of the overall velocity distribution .",
    "it seems that an encounter is a two - body problem , as there are only two planetesimals involved , but the central mass has also a major influence turning the problem into a three - body encounter the complexity of the problem is considerably simplified by reducing it to hill s problem @xcite .    consider two masses @xmath46 and @xmath47 that orbit a much larger mass @xmath48 , where both masses are small compared to the central mass @xmath48 .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath49 could be arbitrary .",
    "this special type of a three body problem is denoted as hill s problem , originally devised to calculate the orbit of the moon .",
    "it provides a convenient framework to examine planetesimal encounters in the potential of a star .",
    "the equations of motion of the two planetesimals including the central potential and their mutual interaction are : @xmath50 we now introduce the relative vector @xmath51 and the centre - of - mass @xmath52 : @xmath53 furthermore , the equations of motion are transformed to a corotating set of coordinates which are scaled by the mutual hill radius @xmath54 and the local kepler frequency @xmath40 @xmath55{\\frac{m_1+m_2}{3m_c}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are heliocentric cylindrical coordinates .",

    "hence it is possible to expand the central potential about the reference orbit .",
    "this yields approximate equations for the relative motion and the centre - of - mass :    @xmath59    @xmath60    the equations  [ eqx1 ] and [ eqx2 ] have some interesting properties : firstly , the centre - of - mass motion separates from the interaction of the two bodies . secondly , the scaled relative motion is independent of the masses @xmath46 and @xmath47 , implying a fundamental similarity of planetesimal encounters makes extensive use of this property . ] . as eq .",

    "the field planetesimals also damp the excitation due to protoplanet  protoplanet interactions and keep them on nearly circular orbits .",
    "the balance between these scatterings and the dynamical friction due to smaller bodies establishes a roughly constant orbital separation @xmath64 @xcite : @xmath105{\\frac{7{\\tilde e_m}^2 m } { 2\\pi\\sigma a r }   } \\label{b_sep } \\\\",

    "the stabilised spacing prevents collisions between protoplanets , but it also restricts the feeding zone  the area from which a protoplanet accretes .",
    "if all matter in the feeding zone is accreted by the protoplanet , it reaches its final isolation mass @xcite : @xmath107 inserting eq .",
    "[ b_sep ] yields the isolation mass in units of the mass of the host star @xmath48 : @xmath108    there is a weak dependence on the density @xmath109 of the protoplanet , but the most important parameter is the surface density @xmath110 .",
    "if we take the minimum mass solar nebula as an example , the radial dependence of the surface density implies an isolation mass that grows with increasing distance to the host start .",
    "hence protoplanets beyond some critical radial distance are massive enough ( larger than @xmath111 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to initiate gas accretion from the protoplanetary disc .",
    ".isolation mass for different surface densities at @xmath112 1 au and @xmath113 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the formation of planetary systems represents a challenge from a numerical standpoint .",
    "the dynamical problem spans over many orders of magnitudes in length and demands the combination of different techniques .",
    "we have presented a composite algorithm that brings together the advantages of direct - summation tools and statistics for the description of the planetesimal disc .",
    "direct - summation @xmath0body techniques have been around for some decades and have proven their accuracy in a very large number of studies of stellar clusters such as galactic nuclei and globular and open clusters .",
    "we deem it to be the numerical tool to integrate the motion of the bodies for the very precise integration of the orbits and treatment of close encounters .",
    "typically , in a simulation of a stellar system , the energy is conserved in each timestep by @xmath114 ( where @xmath115 is the total energy and @xmath116 the difference between the former and current total energy for a specific time ) , so that even if we integrate for a long time the cluster , the accumulated energy error is negligible .",
    "nevertheless , porting the numerical tool to the problem of planetary dynamics is not straighforward and requires important modifications and additions . in this work we present them in detail : the neighbour radius selection for the protoplanets , the hermite iteration and we introduce for the very first time the new extended hermite scheme , since the usual hermite scheme is not sufficient to integrate planetesimal orbits accurately enough .",
    "then we bring in new forces to the problem , namely the introduction of the central potential of the star , as well as the drag forces , which depend on the gas density and size of the planetesimals .",
    "hence , the regularisation scheme , crucial to exactly integrate the close encounters , has to be accordingly modified .",
    "we then introduce the disc geometry and discuss the required changes to the neighbour scheme and prediction , as well as the communication algorithm and block size distribution .    for the statistical description of the planetesimal disc we employ a fokker - planck approach .",
    "we include dynamical friction , high- and low - speed encounters , the role of distant encounters as well as gas and collisional damping and then generalise the model to inhomogenous discs .",
    "we then describe the combination of the two techniques to address the wole problem of planetesimal dynamics in a realistic way via a transition mass to integrate the evolution of the particles according to their masses .",
    "in particular , we introduce and describe the extended hermite scheme , which reduces the the energy error by three orders of magnitude with the same number of force evaluations , compared to the standard version of nbody6++ .",
    "while the implementation and some code details are newly introduced to the field of planet formation simulations , the first hybrid approach was developed in the early 90 s .",
    "@xcite ( further improved in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) constructed a hybrid code with a statistical component to treat the smaller particles and a special treatment for the larger particles .",
    "a statistical model covers the field planetesimals with the help of a distribution function ( similar to @xcite ) , whereas the larger particles are individually stored and characterised by mass , semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination .",
    "while the interaction between these single particles and the statistical component is expressed by standard viscous stirring and dynamical friction terms , perturbations among the single particles are equated in a different way .",
    "first , the probability of an encounter of two neighbouring particles is calculated .",
    "this probability is used in a second step to decide whether a ( numerically integrated ) two - body encounter of the neighbouring particles is carried out to derive the change in the orbital elements .",
    "though these two well - defined code components justify to speak about a hybrid approach , the monte  carlo like integration of the largest particles is still closely related to a statistical treatment .",
    "a modified @xmath117body approach is used in the work of @xcite .",
    "their method covers the largest particles by a direct @xmath117body code , which includes the smaller particles as `` tracer '' particles .",
    "the term `` tracer '' indicates that each particle represents a whole ensemble of planetesimals . in a similar line of approach and inspired by this idea , @xcite modified a symplectic algorithm , symba , to study the formation of giant planet cores . however , they made some assumptions in order to calculate the gravitational interaction between the planetesimals .",
    "in particular , they ignored totally close encounters between planetesimals .",
    "@xcite present in their work a scheme based on monte carlo techniques to cover the vast range of sizes .",
    "for this , they assign more resolution to those particles that are more relevant to the interactions , typically the largest bodies .",
    "smaller particles are grouped and treated collectively , which means that they all share the same mass and structural parameters .",
    "this classification is done in accordance to the `` zoom factor '' , a free paramenter .",
    "later , @xcite presented an detailed comparison of their monte carlo code with other techniques , in particular with pure direct - summation @xmath0body results and other statistical studies and found that system leaves the runaway at a larger radius , in particular at the outer disc .",
    "with their simulations , the authors propose a new criterion for the runaway growth - oligarchy transition : from several hundreds of km in the inner disk regions up to a thousand km for the outer disc @xcite .",
    "@xcite published a description of a hybrid method with a basic approach similar to our work .",
    "they employ two velocity dispersions and the surface density of the planetesimals to describe the planetesimal system .",
    "the statistical component includes migration of the planetesimals and dust particles due to gas drag and pointing  robertson drag .",
    "in contrast to our approach , they did not include mass transport due to the diffusion of the planetesimals , which precludes the study of spatial structures induced by the protoplanets .",
    "one must note also that their method uses the standard discretisation of the collisional flux ( see eq .",
    "[ partflux ] ) and thus restrict the spacing factor to @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "@xcite chose a set of test calculations which focused less on the technical aspects of their method , but on an overall comparison with a selected set of standard works on planet formation .",
    "their test simulations are in good agreement with the references simulations , thus indicating a comparable quality of the method .",
    "four years later , the authors presented an updated version of their code for planet formation .",
    "the new characteristics of the code included 1d evolution of the viscous disc , gas accretion on to massive cores , as well as accretion of small particles in planetary atmospheres @xcite .    while a variety of hybrid approaches emerged over the past years , this technique is still far from a routinely application and is still challenged by many open issues .",
    "hybrid codes bear the potential to address the dynamical evolution of a whole planetary system , the later stages of protoplanet formation initiate a strong interaction with the gaseous disc , which may require more diligence than the inclusion of a few additional interaction terms .",
    "however , the development is picking up speed , which places our work in a good position for further research .",
    "central force @xmath119 per mass ( i.e. acceleration ) and its time derivatives are : @xmath120    the @xmath121 denote the central force and its time derivatives , whereas @xmath122 and @xmath123 refer to the total acceleration of the particle .",
    "the assumption that @xmath124 and @xmath123 are independent of each other allows the derivation of averaged expressions for particle  particle interactions : @xmath125 we combine these expressions with aarseth s time step formula to derive the regular time step as a function of the neighbour sphere radius @xmath126 : @xmath127 @xmath128 is the average particle distance and @xmath129 is the impact parameter for a 90degree deflection .",
    "the mass flux according to the perturbation equation  [ eqdeltan ] is : @xmath130 firstly , we employ the substitution @xmath131 to solve for the partial flux @xmath132 : @xmath133 the second contribution @xmath134 requires a slightly different transformation : @xmath135 thus the partial flux @xmath134 is : @xmath136 we change to a new set of logarithmic coordinates @xmath137 which transforms the total flux @xmath138 to a convolution integral : @xmath139 du_1 \\label{fpsum } \\\\",
    "p    & =   \\frac{1+\\alpha}{1 + 2w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath140 refers to the already derived solution for self - similar collisions .",
    "hence we expand eq .",

    "hence we recover the same functional form of the perturbed mass flux @xmath144 as for self - similar collisions : @xmath145",
    "while the success of a general approximation of the coagulation equation depends heavily on the used coagulation kernel , we nevertheless provide a more general approach to embed section  [ collcasc ] in a broader context .",
    "the standard coagulation equation is : @xmath146 in virtue of our experience drawn from the perturbation expansion , we transform the coagulation equation to logarithmic coordinates @xmath147 and employ the size distribution @xmath143 relative to the steady - state solution @xmath148 : @xmath149 @xmath150 is the properly transformed new coagulation kernel .",
    "@xmath143 is expanded under the integral to arrive at a moment expansion of the flux @xmath151 : @xmath152 retaining only the leading order terms , we recover an approximate coagulation equation which is similar to the inviscid burgers equation : @xmath153",
