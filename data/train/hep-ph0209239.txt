    "the phenomenological description of heavy quark decays requires to minimize theoretical uncertainties related to strong interaction effects .",
    "one therefore tries to separate ( factorize ) calculable short - distance qcd contributions from long - distance physics related to the non - perturbative binding of quarks and gluons .",
    "short distance effects from integrating out the weak gauge bosons and the top quark are included in the electroweak effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "recently , the factorization of short - distance qcd dynamics related to the heavy quark mass @xmath1 has been established @xcite for exclusive heavy - to - light decays , in situations where the recoil - energy to the light quark is large , @xmath2 . in the infinite mass limit , @xmath3",
    ", hadronic amplitudes can be expressed in terms of perturbatively calculable coefficient functions ( hard - scattering amplitudes ) and hadronic transition form factors and light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "an elegant and efficient way to derive the factorization theorems in cases like the one at hand , is to match qcd on an effective theory ( `` soft - collinear effective theory '' , scet ) @xcite .",
    "the effective theory contains the field modes relevant to reproduce the infrared physics , while the effect of hard modes is `` integrated out '' and encoded in effective coupling constants ( wilson coefficients ) . in the following , we will discuss the systematic derivation of power - corrections within the effective theory approach , deriving both , the effective soft - collinear lagrangian , and the heavy quark current to order @xmath0 accuracy @xcite .",
    "( some aspects of power corrections in scet have also been discussed in @xcite . )",
    "in order to construct the effective lagrangian , one first has to identify the relevant degrees of freedom : nearly on - shell heavy quarks are described within the well - known heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the different light quark and gluon modes are characterized by the scaling of momentum components with respect to light - like vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 collinear momenta scale as @xmath7 .",
    "ultra - soft particles have @xmath8 . here the power - counting is expressed in terms of the small parameter @xmath9 ( the appropriate powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath1 will not be quoted explicitly in the following ) .",
    "hard fields with @xmath10 are to be integrated out .",
    "may appear .",
    "we will concentrate on power - corrections at tree - level , and the issue of soft modes will not be important for the further considerations . ] the kinematical situation to be described by the effective theory is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .    = 0.65    at leading power , only collinear particles appear .",
    "to proceed , it is convenient to split the collinear quark spinor @xmath11 into its `` large '' and `` small '' components , @xmath12 where the scaling of the field components with @xmath13 follows from the quark propagator in qcd . after integrating out the small spinor component @xmath14 , the leading - power collinear quark lagrangian reads @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the covariant derivative including collinear gluon fields .",
    "we note that the second term in ( [ lcoll ] ) is genuinely non - local and can not be expanded into a series of local operators .",
    "furthermore , the collinear lagrangian lacks an intrinsic scale ( the energy of collinear particles is not a lorentz - invariant quantity ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the renormalization of the collinear effective lagrangian is `` trivial '' if a lorentz - invariant renormalization scheme like @xmath17 is used , i.e.  all uv - divergences can be absorbed into the running coupling constant . at sub - leading power in @xmath13 also ultra - soft quark and gluon fields ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) have to be included .",
    "since ultra - soft fields have different characteristic wave - lengths than collinear fields , one has to perform a `` light - cone multipole expansion '' for vertices with collinear and ultra - soft particles .",
    "this amounts to taylor - expanding all ultra - soft fields around @xmath20 , and applying leading - power equations of motion to obtain manifestly gauge - invariant results .",
    "( notice that our formalism differs from @xcite where the large momentum components of collinear particles are extracted and collinear fields in the effective theory carry momentum labels . ) the induced power corrections to the collinear quark lagrangian , @xmath21 read ,    [ lxiq2 ] ) has been proven for the abelian case , only . ]",

    "little is known about the non - perturbative functions @xmath58 that parameterize the power - corrections to the form factor relations , and consequently phenomenological predictions beyond leading - power remain model - dependent . however , it is to be stressed that the effective theory framework enables us to put these model estimates on a more solid theoretical basis .",
    "the hard spectator terms , indicated in the last row of ( [ factorize ] ) , have been calculated in qcd ( using a physical factorization prescription ) to first order in the strong coupling @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "a treatment of hard spectator scattering within the effective theory framework is still missing .",

    "our results provide another step towards achieving reliable theoretical predictions for @xmath46 meson decays , that can be confronted to experimental data from @xmath46-factories ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in order to test the standard model against new physics .",
