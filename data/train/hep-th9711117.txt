    "<S> several proofs for it have been given @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite mainly based on the so - called anomaly - inflow argument @xcite and m(atrix ) theory description @xcite . in this paper we would like to add another proof of brane creation based on a different perspective . namely we examine configurations of a m fivebrane in the eleven - dimensional geometry @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the taub - nut space . </S>",
    "<S> this eleven - dimensional background is the classical solution of eleven - dimensional sugra which provides @xcite a single d sixbrane solution of iia string theory . in these configurations </S>",
    "<S> two - dimensional part of the worldvolume of fivebrane is embedded holomorphically into @xmath2 . with a detailed study on its holomorphic embedding </S>",
    "<S> we consider its iia limit at each value of the modulus of the configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there are two possibilities of the iia configuration , one of which is the configuration consisting of a ns fivebrane and a d sixbrane while the other is the configuration consisting of a ns fivebrane , a d sixbrane and a d fourbrane . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the fourbrane is actually suspended between the fivebrane and the sixbrane . </S>",
    "<S> this appearance of fourbrane can be interpreted as the result of the crossing of the fivebrane and the sixbrane in iia picture .          </S>",
    "<S> consider a single d sixbrane with worldvolume @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> d sixbrane is a magnetic source of the @xmath4 gauge potential @xmath5 which is a bosonic ingredient of iia sugra multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , compactifying the eleventh dimension into a circle , the eleven - dimensional metric tensor @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , which is a bosonic ingredient of eleven - dimensional sugra multiplet , gives rise to the @xmath4 gauge potential @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore d sixbrane is the kaluza - klein monopole . though the four - dimensional space @xmath8 transversal to the sixbrane is originally a flat space @xmath9 @xmath10 , the existence of sixbrane makes it a curved one . </S>",
    "<S> it actually becomes @xcite the taub - nut space @xmath2 . to describe the taub - nut geometry </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the coordinates @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the taub - nut metric acquires the standard form @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 denotes the position of the sixbrane . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is chosen so that it satisfies the relation @xmath19 notice that the @xmath4 gauge potential @xmath5 can be read from eq.([tn metric ] ) as @xmath5 @xmath20 . since @xmath18 is a quantity determined by relation ( [ omega ] ) , it has an ambiguity depending on the direction of the dirac string associated with the sixbrane . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out useful to fix the gauge potential including the dirac string . by separating the three - vector @xmath21 into two parts @xmath22 where @xmath23 the @xmath4 gauge potential @xmath5 can be put into the form @xmath24 where we introduce @xmath25 as @xmath26 notice that the position of the sixbrane is denoted by @xmath27 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lambda ] ) . with the above choice of the gauge potential the field strength @xmath28 acquires the dirac string of the following type @xmath29 the dirac string is now realized as the semi - infinite line in the @xmath30-space which runs from @xmath31 , parallel with the @xmath32-axis , into @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> what is a counterpart of the dirac string in the taub - nut geometry ? recall that the taub - nut space can be regarded as the fibered space which base and fiber are respectively the @xmath30-space and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a singular fiber at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the so - called nut singularity . with this understanding of the taub - nut space , an inverse image of the dirac string in the taub - nut space </S>",
    "<S> gives its counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> it is the non - compact two - cycle which is precisely projected onto the dirac string .    </S>",
    "<S> the taub - nut space @xmath2 admits to have an hyper - khler structure . </S>",
    "<S> especially it is possible to choose a complex structure so that the taub - nut metric ( [ tn metric ] ) becomes khler . </S>",
    "<S> it is given @xcite by introducing the following holomorphic coordinates @xmath35 @xmath36 with these holomorphic coordinates the taub - nut metric ( [ tn metric ] ) has the form given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) . ] can be rewritten as @xmath37 so it becomes @xcite khlerian .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a m fivebrane which worldvolume is topologically @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> its four - dimensional part `` @xmath39 '' is mapped into the @xmath40-space and identified with it . </S>",
    "<S> its two - dimensional part denoted by the complex plane is supposed to be holomorphically embedded into the above taub - nut space . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the holomorphic embedding of the following type @xmath41 where `` @xmath42 '' is the complex function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 given in eq.([y ] ) . as we shall show soon , eq.([m5 ] ) describes a configuration consisting of the fivebrane sitting to the right of the sixbrane in the taub - nut space . </S>",
    "<S> using expression ( [ y ] ) one can separate eq.([m5 ] ) into radial and angular parts . </S>",
    "<S> the radial part acquires the form @xmath45 while the angular part becomes @xmath46 notice that these two equations determine respectively @xmath32 and @xmath44 as the functions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote them by @xmath49 and @xmath50 for brevity .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall first examine the solution @xmath50 for eq.([imaginary part ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it actually describes a vortex at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this vortex corresponds to an intersection of the dirac string of the @xmath4 gauge potential @xmath5 and the fivebrane .- space . to discuss their intersection in the taub - nut space </S>",
    "<S> we should replace the dirac string by the non - compact two - cycle projected to the dirac string . </S>",
    "<S> but , even in the taub - nut space , formulas described in terms of differential forms such as eq.([dirac string ] ) do not change . ] </S>",
    "<S> it can be explained by the following argument : consider the sigma model action of the fivebrane . its bosonic part will include the term , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the worldvolume coordinates and @xmath54 is an auxiliary metric on the worldvolume . by rewriting @xcite the eleven - dimensional metric @xmath6 under the @xmath14-compactification in terms of the ten - dimensional quantities @xmath55 @xmath56 , it can be seen that the above bosonic part induces the term , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives an interaction of @xmath59 with the @xmath4 gauge potential . </S>",
    "<S> through this interaction the dirac string will make a vortex ( of @xmath44 ) on the fivebrane worldvolume .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be also noticed that , since the sixbranes are the magnetic sources of the @xmath4 gauge potential , the number of the vortices made by the intersection between the dirac strings ( or their non - compact two - cycles ) and the fivebranes define @xcite the linking number @xcite among them . as for the configurations determined by ( [ m5 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it is an invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> next let us pay attention to the solution @xmath49 for eq.([real part ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the above argument makes the fivebrane intersect with the dirac string which we have just fixed in eq.([dirac string ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it implies the inequality @xmath60 which means that the fivebrane is located on the `` right '' of the sixbrane in the taub - nut space .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> it might be convenient to describe a process of brane creation in a very heuristic manner . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we shall consider the holomorphic embedding of the fivebrane when the position of the sixbrane @xmath27 goes to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> let us examine the situations , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we first remark that , in the region @xmath62 , the r.h.s of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ real part ] ) behaves approximately as @xmath63 owing to this estimate , taking care of the absolute value in it , eq.([real part ] ) will acquire the following form at the limit @xmath64 @xmath65 while it will become at the limit @xmath66 @xmath67 notice that the taub - nut space itself can be regarded as the flat space @xmath68 in these limits . </S>",
    "<S> so , according to the discussion given in @xcite , the first case describes , in iia picture , a configuration consisting of a ns fivebrane and a semi - infinite d fourbrane sticking to the ns fivebrane from the right while the second case describes a configuration of a ns fivebrane . </S>",
    "<S> this will mean that the sixbrane running from @xmath69 to @xmath70 creates a d fourbrane by crossing the fivebrane . </S>",
    "<S> this may give an heuristic explanation for the brane creation via m theory . </S>",
    "<S> in spite of its intuitiveness it is still too naive to justify . </S>",
    "<S> so let us provide a rigorous treatment .      </S>",
    "<S> without loss of generality we can set the position of the sixbrane @xmath71 by a parallel shift of the coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> in such coordinates eq.([real part ] ) acquires the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 . since it does not depend on the phase of @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> the solution for this equation is a function of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote it by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that relation ( [ s - m intersection ] ) implies @xmath77 let us start by describing how the solution depends on @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be given by partially - differentiating eq.([eq for b ] ) with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> after a little calculation we obtain @xmath78 where we introduce @xmath79 by @xmath80 since it holds @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , it means that @xmath76 is monotonically decreasing with respect to @xmath74 while it is monotonically increasing with respect to @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the behavior of @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([b0-dependence ] ) implies the following 1st order differential equation for @xmath85 @xmath86 which can be integrated out . </S>",
    "<S> one can find @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a positive constant . owing to this form </S>",
    "<S> there exists a critical value @xmath89 such that @xmath90 implies @xmath91 and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , since it has been pointed out that @xmath76 is monotonically decreasing with respect to @xmath74 , there exists @xmath92 which satisfies @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit form of @xmath92 can be obtainable from eq.([eq for b ] ) by inserting @xmath94 into it @xmath95 since @xmath92 is , by definition , a non - negative quantity and it must be zero at the critical value of @xmath75 , we can find out @xmath89 as @xmath96 notice that it holds @xmath97 . inserting this value into the integrated form @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath99 is determined by the relation @xmath100    finally we shall consider the intersection between the fivebrane and @xmath101 plane in the taub - nut space . </S>",
    "<S> it is a circle with a definite radius . </S>",
    "<S> the radius @xmath102 can be read from eq.([eq for b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by @xmath103    now , gathering all these data about some characteristic points of the embedded two - plane , it is possible to draw the shape of the fivebrane in the taub - nut space . </S>",
    "<S> there appear three cases depending on the values of @xmath75 : @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in fig.[three cases ] these three cases are depicted in the @xmath107-plane . </S>",
    "<S> three characteristic points are denoted by a , b and c. their coordinates in the @xmath107-plane are respectively @xmath108 and @xmath109 .      </S>",
    "<S> generically the iia limit of the above configurations will be achieved by taking the limit @xmath110 with fixing the value of @xmath111 is our convention . ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( therefore @xmath75 goes to infinity . ) </S>",
    "<S> let us denote this value by @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> we first examine the case of @xmath104 . in this case one </S>",
    "<S> should set @xmath113 because of the relation @xmath114 . and , to fix @xmath112 at a finite negative value </S>",
    "<S> , one must take @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the iia limits of the points a , b and c. the point a will become the point given by the coordinates @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> what is the value of @xmath117 ? </S>",
    "<S> we shall first rewrite eq.([beta ] ) into the form @xmath118 notice that , owing to eq.([estimate on beta ] ) , @xmath119 is a positive quantity at a non - zero value of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to fix the r.h.s . of the equation at a negative value , @xmath120 in the l.h.s . must become a negative quantity as @xmath13 goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xmath121 . so the point a approaches to the origin . </S>",
    "<S> next we examine the point b. it becomes the point given by the coordinates @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> using the expression given in ( [ u ] ) one can also see @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the point b also approaches to the origin under the iia limit . </S>",
    "<S> as regards the point c , it becomes the point given by the coordinates @xmath124 . by the expression given in ( [ r ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one can see @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the point c approaches to @xmath126 .    </S>",
    "<S> the segment between the points a and c on the fivebrane in the @xmath107-plane reduces , in the iia limit , to a line segment @xmath127 where @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this line segment in the @xmath129-plane is still one - dimensional in the three - dimensional @xmath130-space since @xmath131 implies @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> how about the other part of the fivebrane ? </S>",
    "<S> to obtain its iia limit let us rewrite eq.([v - dependence ] ) in terms of @xmath133 and @xmath134 . by introducing the quantity </S>",
    "<S> @xmath135 @xmath136 it becomes @xmath137 so , this part of the fivebrane approaches to the line @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> due to the rotational symmetry around the @xmath133-axis this line corresponds to a two - dimensional plane in the @xmath130-space . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the iia limit of the configuration with @xmath104 describes the configuration of a ns fivebrane , a d fourbrane and a d sixbrane . </S>",
    "<S> the ns fivebrane is located at @xmath139 while the d fourbrane with worldvolume @xmath140 is suspended , in the @xmath130-space , between the point @xmath141 on the ns fivebrane and the d sixbrane at @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> ( fig.[iialimit ] ( a ) )    next we shall consider the case of @xmath143 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we must set @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> so , @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> the iia limit of the point a is given by the coordinates @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> let us show @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> rewrite eq.([beta ] ) into the form @xmath148 in order to fix the r.h.s . of the equation at a positive value , @xmath149 in the l.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> must approach to @xmath150 as @xmath13 goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it holds @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath152 . regarding the l.h.s . of eq.([iia beta 2 ] ) as @xmath153 and considering its iia limit , we obtain @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the point a approaches to @xmath157 in the iia limit . as for the point c </S>",
    "<S> , it becomes the point given by the coordinates @xmath158 . with the same reason as in the previous case it is @xmath157 in the iia limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally the point b becomes the point given by the coordinates @xmath159 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath160 behaves as @xmath161 at a small value of @xmath13 and goes to the infinity after the iia limit , it holds @xmath162 . </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , the iia limit of the configuration with @xmath143 describes the configuration of a ns fivebrane and a d sixbrane . </S>",
    "<S> the ns fivebrane is located at @xmath139 and the d sixbrane is at @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> there appears no d fourbrane . </S>",
    "<S> ( fig.[iialimit ] ( b ) )    finally the study for the case of @xmath106 is remained . </S>",
    "<S> but it is easy to see that this case reduces to that of @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the iia limit coincides with the previous case . </S>"
