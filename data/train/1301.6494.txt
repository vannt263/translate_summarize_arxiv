    "markov renewal processes or their semi - markov representation have been considered in the seismological literature since they are models which allow the distribution of the inter - occurrence times between earthquakes to depend on the last and the next earthquake and to be not necessarily exponential .",
    "the time predictable and the slip predictable models studied in @xcite , in @xcite and in @xcite are special cases of markov renewal processes .",
    "these models are capable of interpreting the predictable behavior of strong earthquakes in some seismogenetic area . in these processes",
    "the magnitude is a deterministic function of the inter - occurrence time .",
    "a stationary markov renewal process with weibull inter - occurrence times has been studied from a classical statistical point of view in @xcite .",
    "the weibull model allows to consider monotonic hazard rates ; it contains the exponential model as special case which gives a markov poisson point process . in that paper",
    "the parameters of the model have been fitted to the large earthquakes in north anatolian fault zone through maximum likelihood and the markov poisson point process assumption is tested . in order to capture a non monotonic behavior in the hazard , in @xcite the model of @xcite is modified and a markov renewal process with inter - occurrence times that are mixtures of an exponential and a weibull distribution is fitted to turkish data . in @xcite a parametric semi - markov model with generalized weibull distribution for the inter - occurrence times is considered and fitted to italian earthquakes . this semi - markov model with generalized weibull distributed times has been first used in @xcite to study the evolution of hiv infected patients .",
    "@xcite consider a semi - markov model for the seismic hazard assessment in the northern aegean sea and they estimate the quantities of interest ( semi - markov kernel , markov renewal functions , etc . ) through a nonparametric method .    while a wide literature concerning classical inference for markov renewal models for earthquake forecasting exists , to our knowledge in this context a bayesian approach is limited .",
    "@xcite consider a semi - markov model with log - normal distributed discrete inter - occurrence times that apply to the large earthquakes in the circum - pacific belt .",
    "they stress the fact that using bayesian techniques is relevant when prior knowledge is available and is fruitful even if the sample size is small . @xcite",
    "have also employed semi - markov models in the bayesian framework but applied to a completely different area : sow farm management .",
    "they use winbugs to perform computations ( but without giving details ) and elicit their prior distributions on parameters from knowledge on farming practices .    from a probabilistic viewpoint ,",
    "a bayesian statistical treatment of a semi - markov process amounts to model the data as a mixture of semi - markov processes , where the mixing measure is supported on the parameters , by means of their prior laws .",
    "a complete characterization of such a mixture is given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we develop a parametric bayesian analysis for a markov renewal process modeling earthquakes in an italian seismic region .",
    "the magnitudes are classified into three categories according to their severity and these categories represent the state visited by the process . following @xcite , the inter - occurrence times are assumed to be weibull random variables .",
    "the prior distribution of the parameters of the model is elicited using an `` historical dataset '' .",
    "the time of the last occurrence in the historical dataset constitutes the origin for the `` current sample '' , which is formed by the sequences of earthquakes and the corresponding inter - occurrence times collected up to some time @xmath0 to form the likelihood function .",
    "when @xmath0 does not coincide with an earthquake the last observed inter - occurrence time is censored .",
    "the posterior distribution of the parameters is obtained through gibbs sampling and the following summaries are estimated : the transition probabilities , the shape and scale parameters of the weibull waiting times for each transition and the so - called cross state - probabilities ( csps ) .",
    "the transition probabilities indicate whether the strength of the next earthquake is in some way dependent on the strength of the last one ; the shape parameters of the waiting time indicate whether the hazard rate between two earthquakes of given magnitude classes is decreasing or increasing ; the csps indicate what is the probability that the next earthquake occurs at or before a given time and is of a given magnitude , conditionally on the waiting time from last earthquake and on its magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:1 ]",
    "we illustrate the dataset .",
    "it is one of the sequences analyzed by @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] introduces the parametric markov renewal model .",
    "three magnitude classes are considered and a weibull distribution is assumed for the inter - occurrence times . section  [ sec:3 ] deals with the elicitation of the prior , which is based on a generalized inverse gamma distribution , considering also the case of scarce prior information .",
    "section  [ sec : apennines ] contains the data analysis with the estimation of the above - mentioned summaries .",
    "the matter of whether the observed earthquakes reflect a time predictable or a slip predictable model is also discussed .",
    "section  [ sec:6 ] is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "an appendix contains the detailed derivation of the full conditional distributions and the jags implementation of the gibbs sampler .",
    "we test our method on a sequence of seismic events chosen among those examined by @xcite , which was given us by the author .",
    "the sequence collects events that occurred in a tectonically homogeneous macroregion , identified as @xmath1 by @xcite and corresponding to the central northern apennines in italy .",
    "the subdivision of italy into eight ( tectonically homogeneous ) seismic macroregions can be found in the @xcite and the data are collected by the @xcite catalogue . considering earthquakes with magnitude @xmath2 , the sequence is complete from year 1838 : using a lower magnitude would make the completeness of the series questionable , especially in its earlier part .",
    "the map of these earthquakes marked by dots appears in figure  [ fig : mappa ] .",

    "then a magnitude state space with three states is obtained by indexing an earthquake by 1 , 2 or 3 if its magnitude belongs to intervals @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , respectively . magnitude 4.9 is just the midpoint between 4.5 and 5.3 .",
    "@xcite considers a nonparametric bayesian model for the distribution of the inter - occurrence time between strong earthquakes ( i.e. @xmath3 ) , after a preliminary data analysis which rules out weibull , gamma , log - normal distributions among other frequently used holding time distributions . on the other hand , with a markov renewal model",
    ", the sequence of all the inter - occurrence times is subdivided into shorter ones according to the magnitudes , so that we think that a parametric distribution is a viable option .",
    "in particular , we focussed on the macroregion @xmath1 because the weibull distribution seems to fit the inter - occurrence times better than in other macroregions",

    "the qq - plots for @xmath1 are shown in figure  [ fig : qqplots ] .",
    "the plot for transitions from 1 to 3 shows a sample quantile that is considerably larger than expected .",
    "the outlying point corresponds to a long inter - occurrence time of about 9 years , between 1987 and 1996 , while 99  percent of inter - occurence times are below 5 years .",
    "obviously , the classification into macroregions influences the way the earthquake sequence is subdivided .",
    "let us observe over a period of time @xmath7 $ ] a process in which different events occur , with random inter - occurence times .",

    "let us denote by @xmath10 the number of times the process changes state in the time interval @xmath7 $ ] and let @xmath11 denote the time of the @xmath12-th change of state .",

    "see , for example , @xcite .",

    "we will say that the process visits the string @xmath49 if a visit to state @xmath12 is followed by a visit to state @xmath50 and denote :    * @xmath51 the time spent in state @xmath12 at the @xmath52-th visit to string @xmath49 * @xmath53 the number of visits to the string @xmath49 .    then , assuming @xmath54 , from equations   and we obtain the following expression for the likelihood function :    @xmath55\\times \\\\   \\times \\left(\\sum_{k\\in e}p_{j_{\\t}k } \\exp\\left\\{-\\left(\\frac{u_t}{\\theta_{j_{\\t } k}}\\right)^{\\a_{j_{\\t }   k}}\\right\\}\\right)\\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    our purpose is now to perform a bayesian analysis for @xmath56 and @xmath57 which allows us to introduce prior knowledge on the parameters .",
    "as we will show , this analysis is possible , using a gibbs sampling approach , via the introduction of an auxiliary variable in order to treat easily the right - censored datum .",
    "in our bayesian analysis , we assume that @xmath35 is independent on @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in particular , the rows of @xmath35 are @xmath60 independent vectors with dirichlet distribution with parameters @xmath61 and total mass @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "this means that , for @xmath63 , the prior density of the @xmath12-th row is @xmath64 on @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67    as far as @xmath68 and @xmath59 is concerned , we will assume the @xmath69 s , given the @xmath44 s , are independent with generalized inverse gamma density : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a positive function of @xmath44 .",
    "in other terms , a priori @xmath73 , given @xmath74 , has a gamma density with shape @xmath75 and rate @xmath76 in symbols @xmath77 .",
    "finally , we will assume the components of @xmath68 are independent and have a log - concave density @xmath78 with support bounded away from zero .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the log - concavity of @xmath79 is necessary in the implementation of the gibbs sampler ( see also @xcite ) , although adjustments exist for the non - log - concave case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , a support bounded away from zero ensures the existence of the posterior moments of the @xmath69 s .",
    "anyway , we will specify @xmath79 in detail in the next section .      in this section",
    "we focus our attention on the prior of @xmath80 , for @xmath81 fixed .",
    "following an approach developed in @xcite , we provide a marginal prior distribution @xmath79 for the shapes @xmath44 along with a statistical justification of the choice of the generalized inverse gamma prior .",
    "an interpretation of the hyperparameters is also provided .",
    "first of all , for the sake of clarity , let us drop the indices @xmath81 in the notations and quantities introduced in the previous section .",
    "suppose now that a vector of historical dataset @xmath82 is available , i.e. a past `` historical dataset '' of @xmath83 sojourn times in state @xmath12 followed by a visit to state @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , let us accept to use as prior density for @xmath84 its posterior density given @xmath85 , when we start from the improper prior : @xmath86 with suitable @xmath87 and @xmath88 . then it is immediate to see that this action corresponds to assume as prior distribution for @xmath89 given @xmath90 the density : @xmath91 and as prior density of @xmath90 : @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94^{-1}$ ] .",
    "[ remark:123 ] we notice that the prior for @xmath95 we propose has a simple hierarchical structure : @xmath96 is a generalized inverse gamma density with the first parameter equal to the size of an historical dataset from the same process , whereas the second parameter is a deterministic function of @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the improper prior we start with depends on two parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 that can be chosen in a such way that the proper prior distribution of @xmath89 derived from it has finite moments of sufficiently high order .",
    "finally , it is easy to see that , if @xmath99 , then the prior @xmath100 of @xmath90 is proper .      in the previous section we consider a prior with a simple hierarchical structure obtained as the posterior coming from a bayesian inference on historical data . in order to simplify the expression of the posterior distributions and to ensure that posterior moments are finite",
    ", we replace the function @xmath101 , in @xmath102 and @xmath103 by an easier convex function of @xmath90 .",
    "more precisely , we replace such a function with @xmath104^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath105 is a positive number and @xmath106 .",
    "then one can see that , for such a choice of @xmath107 , @xmath105 turns out to be the quantile of order @xmath108 of the marginal distribution of the inter - occurrence times between a visit to state @xmath12 followed by a visit to @xmath50 .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "hence , for a fixed @xmath106 , we can estimate @xmath105 using the historical data .",
    "denote by @xmath109 such an estimate and let @xmath110^{-1}.\\ ] ] thus , we propose for our bayesian analysis the following priors : @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath99 , @xmath103 is a proper prior if @xmath108 is chosen in such a way that @xmath113 and is always log - concave for any @xmath114 .",
    "notice that such a choice is possible for almost all set of data .",
    "finally let us elicit the hyperparameters @xmath115 and @xmath98 in order that the posterior second moment of @xmath89 is finite .",
    "since @xmath116^{2 / \\a}\\right)\\leq \\tilde{k } \\e(\\gamma(m-2/\\a))\\ ] ] for a suitable constant @xmath117 , then one can see that if @xmath118 and @xmath119 , then @xmath120 and hence too the posterior second moment of @xmath89 is finite . as noticed above , @xmath103 is a log - concave density for any @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath122 , @xmath103 is an @xmath115-shifted gamma density .",
    "the construction of the prior distribution of @xmath123 has to be modified for those pair of states between which no more than two transitions were observed , that is , @xmath124 .    if @xmath125 then @xmath126 , which rules out decreasing hazard rates . in the absence of additional specific prior information ,",
    "this is an arbitrary restriction , so an @xmath115 value smaller than 1 must be chosen . then , the prior second moment of @xmath89 is not finite anymore .",
    "for the posterior second moment to be finite we need @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the number of transitions between the two concerned states in the ( current ) sample .",
    "thus the second moment of @xmath89 can stay non - finite , even a posteriori , if @xmath129 .",
    "this would show that the data add little information for that specific transition . to avoid this",
    ", we may let @xmath130 , corresponding to the smallest prior sample size such that @xmath131 .",
    "the value of @xmath98 can still be @xmath132 .    if @xmath133 , the single historical observation @xmath134 determines @xmath135 .",
    "as @xmath136 for any @xmath108 , it seems reasonable to use @xmath137 , so @xmath134 would represent the prior opinion on the median sojourn time .",
    "since with @xmath133 the argument of the exponent in @xmath103 in is zero so that @xmath103 is improper , then we make it proper by restricting its support to an interval @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "the value @xmath139 is suitable for all practical purposes .",
    "as before , the choice @xmath140 would be too much restrictive , so we select again @xmath130 . the rule @xmath122 would give @xmath141 in this case , so we keep @xmath142 .",
    "if @xmath143 , the prior information on the number of transitions is that there have been no transitions , but there is no information on the sojourn time . then we introduce a single random fictitious observation @xmath144 , which is uniformly distributed between the smallest and the largest sojourn times associated with all the transitions in the historical dataset , and we use @xmath144 to obtain @xmath145 .",
    "thus we fall in the previous case by substituting @xmath133 for @xmath143 and by assuming @xmath142 and @xmath146 = [ 2/3 , 10]$ ] .    for clearness ,",
    "we summarize the hyperparameter selection for priors - in table  [ table : hyperparameters ] .",
    ".hyperparameter selection as the prior sample size @xmath83 varies [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     cross state - probability plots are an attempt at predicting what type of event and when it is most likely to occur . a cross state - probability ( csp )",
    "@xmath147 represents the probability that the next event will be in state @xmath50 within a time interval @xmath148 under the assumption that the previous event was in state @xmath12 and @xmath149 time units have passed since its occurrence : @xmath150 fig .",
    "[ figure : csp ] displays the csps with time origin on 31 december 2002 , the closing date of the @xcite catalogue . at this time",
    ", the last recorded event had been in class 2 and had occurred 965 days earlier ( so @xmath149 is about 32 months ) . from these plots",
    "we can read out the probability that an event of any given type will occur before a certain number of months .",
    "for example , after 24 months , the sum of the mean csps in the three graphs indicates that the probability that an event will have occurred is more than 90  percent , with a larger probability assigned to an event of type 2 , followed by type 1 and type 3 .",
    "the posterior means of the csps are also reported in table  [ table : csp ] .",
    "the predictive capability of our model can be assessed by marking the time of the next event on the relevant csp plot . in our specific case , the first event in 2003 which can be assigned to the macroregion @xmath1 happened in the forl area on 26 january and was of type 1 , with a csp of 7  percent .",
    "this is a low probability , but a single case is not enough to judge our model , which would be a bad one if repeated comparisons did not reflect the pattern represented by the csps .",
    "therefore we repeated the same comparison by re - estimating the model using only the data up to 31 december 2001 , 31 december 2000 , and so on backwards down to 1992 .",
    "for this particular exercise the historical data for prior elicitation are such that the frequency of each transition is at least two ( not three as done so far ) and the hyperparameters are those on the second column of table  [ table : hyperparameters ] .",
    "the reason is that , by going backwards , the only @xmath151 transition is removed from the current data set , so that the csp for @xmath151 would rely on prior information only , resulting in a too large posterior variance of the parameters .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table:31.12.92 - 01 ] .",
    "the boxed numbers correspond to the observed events and it is a good sign that they do not always correspond to very high or very low csps , as this would indicate that events occur too late or too early compared to the estimated model .",
    "an exception is represented by the last four arrays in the table , which are all related to the period from the last event in july 1987 to the event in october 1996 , during which no events with @xmath2 occurred .",
    "this is the longest inter - occurrence time in the whole series and is the outlying point in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qqplots ] and the associated transition is a relatively rare one , so it is not surprising that the boxed csps are small .    the examination of the posterior distributions of transition probabilities and of the predictive distributions of the inter - occurrence times can give some insight into the type of energy release and accumulation mechanism .",
    "we consider two such mechanisms , the time predictable model ( tpm ) and the slip predictable model ( spm ) .    in the tpm , when a maximal energy threshold is reached , some fraction of it ( not always the same ) is released",
    "; therefore , the waiting time for the next event is longer if the current event is stronger .",
    "so , the waiting time distribution depends on the current event type , but not on the next event type , that is , we expect @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "the strength of an event , does not depend on the strength of the previous one , because every time the same energy level has to be reached for the event to occur , so we expect @xmath154 , @xmath153 , that is , a transition matrix with equal rows ( which is indeed the case , as seen from table  [ table : posterior.p ] ) .",
    "the csps   would factorize as follows , @xmath155 so that , given @xmath12 , they are proportional to each other as @xmath153 for any @xmath148 .    in the spm , after an event energy falls to a minimal threshold and increases until the next event , where it starts to increase again from the same threshold . here",
    ", the magnitude of an event depends on the length of the waiting time , but not on the magnitude of the previous one , because energy always accumulates from the same threshold . in this case again @xmath156 , but @xmath157 , so @xmath158 if this is the case csps , given @xmath50 would be equal to each other as @xmath159 for any @xmath148 .",
    "as the a posteriori transition probability matrix has essentially equal rows , the csps should be examined with regard to the properties and to decide whether our sequence is closer to a tpm or to an spm .",
    "an additional feature that can help discriminate is the tail of the waiting time distribution : for a tpm , the tail of the waiting time distribution is thinner _ after _ a weak earthquake than _ after _ a strong one ; for an spm , the tail of the waiting time is thinner _ before _ a weak earthquake than _ before _ a strong one .",
    "however this additional job proves unnecessary , after examination of figures  [ figure:3_past_ratio_tpm ] and [ figure:3_past_ratio_spm ] , which represent the posterior means of the ratios of the csps as a function of @xmath148 for @xmath160 . in fig .",
    "[ figure:3_past_ratio_tpm ] , the ratio of two csps say @xmath161 starts to be equal to @xmath162 only when @xmath148 is large enough for the survival functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 to be close to zero .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in fig .",
    "[ figure:3_past_ratio_spm ] .",
    "the conclusion is that neither a spm nor a tpm is supported by the posterior distributions of the parameters , because of the behavior of the waiting times .",
    "whe have presented a complete methodology for the bayesian inference of a semi - markov process , from the elicitation of the prior distribution , to the computation of posterior summaries , including a guidance for its jags implementation . in particular , we have examined in detail the elicitation of the joint prior density of the shape and scale parameters of the weibull - distributed holding times ( conditional on the transition between two given states ) , deriving in a natural way a specific class of priors , along with a method for the determination of hyperparameters based on `` historical data '' and moment existence conditions . this framework has been applied to the analysis of seismic data , but it can be adopted for inference on any system for which a markov renewal process model is plausible . a possible and not - yet explored application is the modelling of voltage sags ( or voltage dips ) in power engineering : the state space would be formed by different classes of voltage , starting from voltage around its nominal value , down to progressively deeper sags . in the engineering literature , the dynamic aspect of this problem is in fact disregarded , while it could help bringing additional insight into this phenomenon .    with regard to the seismic data analysis",
    ", other uses of our model can be envisaged .",
    "the model can be applied to areas with a less complex tectonics , such as turkey , by replicating for example alvarez s anaysis .",
    "outliers , such as those appearing in figure [ figure : caterpillar_times ] , could point out to events whose assignment to a specific seismogenetic source should be re - discussed .",
    "the analysis of earthquake occurrence can support decision making related to the risk of future events .",
    "we have not examined this issue here , but a methodology is outlined by @xcite .    a final note concerns the more recent italian seismic catalogue @xcite , including events up to the end of 2006 .",
    "every new release of the catalogue involves numerous changes in the parameterization of earthquakes ; as the diss event classification by macroregion is not yet available for events in this catalogue we could not use this more recent source of data .",
    "here we derive the full conditional distributions needed to implement a gibbs sampling and give indications on its jags ( plummer  2010 ) implementation .      without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the last holding time is censored i.e. @xmath165 .",

    "hence @xmath201 and point @xmath175 of the thesis follows . with regard to the full conditional distribution of @xmath45 given @xmath202 , we have @xmath203\\times    \\frac{\\a_{ij}\\hat{b}_q(\\a_{ij } , { \\mathbf x}_{-m_{ij}})^{m_{ij}}}{\\gamma(m_{ij})}\\th_{ij}^{-(1+m_{ij}\\a_{ij } ) } \\\\   & \\times \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{\\hat{b}_q(\\a_{ij } , { \\mathbf x}_{-m_{ij}})}{\\th_{ij}^{\\a_{ij}}}\\right\\}\\\\ \\propto & \\ ; \\ ; \\th_{ij}^{-[1+\\a_{ij}(m_{ij}+n_{ij})]}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{\\hat{b}_q(\\a_{ij } , { \\mathbf x}_{-m_{ij}})+\\tilde{m}_{ij}(\\a_{ij})}{\\th_{ij}^{\\a_{ij}}}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can see , the last function is the kernel of an inverse gamma distribution with parameters @xmath204 and @xmath205 and point @xmath180 of the thesis follows .",
    "a similar reasoning yelds a posterior distribution @xmath206 which is proportional to .",
    "furthermore , concerning its log - concavity , from it follows that @xmath207\\\\ + ( n_{ij}+1)\\log \\a_{ij }       - \\frac{\\hat{b}_q(\\a_{ij } , { \\mathbf x}_{-m_{ij}})+\\tilde{m}_{ij}(\\a_{ij})}{\\th_{ij}^{\\a_{ij}}}\\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] all terms of this expression are log - concave .",
    "in particular @xmath79 is log - concave by construction and the last term is a sum of concave functions of kind @xmath208 .",

    "the uncensored inter - occurrence times are described as weibull distributed with shape and rate parameters that depend on @xmath213 .",
    "the right - censored observation @xmath20 is handled by a special instruction provided by the jags language , which should represent the actual likelihood term correctly , so that the correct form of the full conditional of @xmath191 is preserved .",
    "the description of the prior distributions is routine .",
    "we have mentioned the dirichlet prior for @xmath176 ; @xmath214 has a shifted gamma distribution if @xmath215 , as specified at the end of section  [ sec : simplifying ] ; @xmath216 is gamma distributed , conditionally on @xmath214 , for any value of @xmath75 and @xmath189 ; @xmath196 is uniformly distributed if @xmath195 , otherwise it is constant .",
    "the only nontrivial case arises for the prior of @xmath44 if @xmath217 , which reduces to @xmath218 ( see section  [ sec : scarce ] ) .",
