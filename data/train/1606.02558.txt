    "the sun is an abundant source of both electromagnetic radiation and neutrinos .",
    "it is not a point - source for either of these , with light observed from the entire sun within a region of around 0.5 degrees on the sky  @xcite .",
    "solar models predict that the neutrinos produced by the sun originate from fusion reactions in its core  @xcite , which should comprise approximately @xmath4 to @xmath5 of the sun s total radius @xmath6 according to helioseismological data  @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos originate in shells of different radial positions and widths within this core , depending on the fusion reaction in which they are produced  @xcite e.g. @xmath0b or pp .",
    "however no direct measurement of the structure of this core region exists which makes explicit use of neutrino directionality .",
    "this is because neutrinos are much more challenging to detect than electromagnetic radiation . for the most massive detectors e.g. the super kamiokande experiment  @xcite neutrinos",
    "are detected by looking for cerenkov light emitted by electrons which have been liberated from their atoms by neutrino elastic scattering .",
    "the direction of the electron immediately after scattering is strongly correlated with the incident direction of the neutrino , however its path through the detection medium is blurred by approximately @xmath7 degrees due to scattering effects .",
    "hence in practice the angular distribution of the detected electrons is only weakly correlated with the distribution of solar neutrinos , making it very difficult to reconstruct their incident directions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for such experiments , it has been shown in the case of neutrinos from a supernova that with a large amount of statistics the incident direction of the neutrinos can still be reconstructed , and the direction of the supernova determined to within @xmath8 or better  @xcite . for supernova detection the improvement in the angular resolution of the incident",
    "neutrinos scales approximately as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of detected neutrino events , with the exact resolution depending on the amount of blurring of the electron path and the size of the background .",
    "the super kamiokande experiment detects approximately 15 electron elastic scatter events from @xmath11b solar neutrinos per day  @xcite and has a target mass of approximately 22.5 kilo - tonnes of water .",
    "hence a _ naive first approximation _ of the smallest angular size of the sun s core detectable in principle with neutrinos is @xmath12   \\cdot \\left[\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{det}}}{20 \\ , \\mathrm{kt}}\\right ] \\right)^{1/2 } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is running time and @xmath14 is the detector mass ( and their product is the exposure ) .",
    "this means that for an angular resolution of 0.05 degrees an experiment would need an exposure of approximately @xmath15 kilo - tonne years , equivalent to the super kamiokande experiment taking data for approximately @xmath16 years . in principle",
    "the hyper kamiokande detector  @xcite , which will have a fiducial volume @xmath17 times larger than that of super kamiokande  @xcite , would only need around two years to obtain the same amount of data .    in this work",
    "we take a closer look at this scenario , to quantify how much data is required to determine the sun s core structure with @xmath0b neutrinos using the angular profile and energy spectrum of the scattered electrons , and to what precision this measurement can be made in the near future . in order to do this",
    "we numerically generate profiles of the angle of travel of the electrons , liberated from their atoms by neutrinos produced in the solar core , in a detector with respect to the centre of the sun .",
    "we then perform a two - parameter maximum likelihood analysis to determine the statistical precision with which the central position and size of the @xmath0b neutrino production shell can be measured to with a given exposure .",
    "mev ) with respect to the centre of the sun , which have been liberated from their atoms due to scattering with solar neutrinos , for different values of the mean position of @xmath0b neutrino production in the solar core @xmath18 .",
    "we take an exposure of @xmath19  kton  years and assume a fixed value of @xmath20.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we consider the detection of @xmath0b neutrinos with energies of several mev and above via their elastic scattering with electrons bound in atoms i.e. @xmath21 , which is the detection mechanism used by water cerenkov experiments such as super kamiokande  @xcite . for such experiments , which we focus on in this work , it is the electrons which are actually detected via their cerenkov light emission , and so we need to know how the angular distribution of the neutrinos correlates with that of the detected electrons .    the distribution of the angle of scatter of these electrons @xmath22 relative to the incident direction of the neutrinos is given by the differential cross section @xmath23 .",
    "fortunately the angular distribution of the scattered electrons is strongly correlated with the arrival angle of the original neutrino , especially for recoil energies above @xmath24  mev  @xcite , and so @xmath23 is peaked close to @xmath25 .",
    "the differential scattering rate is then given by the integral of this cross section over all incident neutrino energies @xmath26 , multiplied by the differential flux @xmath27 i.e. @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total number of electrons available for elastic scattering in the detector .",
    "for the flux @xmath27 we use the standard approximately thermal spectra from the sun  @xcite , which is dominated by @xmath0b neutrinos here as we consider only electron recoil energies above 5  mev .    for super kamiokande and similar detectors",
    "the electron scatters multiple times in the detection medium , which smears out the cone of cerenkov light emitted by the electron , which is used to determine the angle of its path .",
    "this smearing can be approximately modelled as a gaussian distribution centred on the initial angle after scattering with a width which depends on energy and is between @xmath30 to @xmath31 , depending on the electron energy  @xcite .",
    "however for water cerenkov detectors such as super kamiokande it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the distribution of angles due to this effect is more accurately modelled by a landau distribution , which has a larger tail than a gaussian .",
    "we use the latter in this work .",
    "hence even though equation  ( [ eqn : rate ] ) is forward - peaked , the angular distribution of electrons is dominated by this multiple scattering .",
    "here we determine the angular distribution of the detected electrons numerically by first generating a large sample of incident neutrino directions , which depends on the size and position of the production region within the solar core .",
    "indeed neutrinos are expected to be produced in shells within the solar core , whose position depends on the particular fusion channel e.g. through pp or @xmath0b .    after generating these incident directions",
    "we then calculate the scattering angles of the electrons using equation  ( [ eqn : rate ] ) and account for the detector resolution using a landau  @xcite distribution consistent with the angular distribution of electrons in super kamiokande .",
    "we show plots of three of these distributions for different values of @xmath18 and with @xmath20 in figure  [ fig : spectra ] and with an exposure of @xmath19  kton  years , focusing on the angles closest to the centre of the sun i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "for all values of @xmath18 the distribution of electron angles is broadly similar , however we can see from figure  [ fig : spectra ] that a larger value of @xmath18 results in a distribution which is more spread out around the peak of the distribution , while a smaller value of @xmath18 results in a more concentrated distribution at the peak .",
    "we can get an idea of the statistics required to distinguish between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 profiles in figure  [ fig : spectra ] by comparing the difference between them , which is about @xmath35 events , to the poisson uncertainty on the total number of events , which is around @xmath36 near the peak of the distribution . hence with @xmath19  kton  years a neutrino experiment should at the very least be able to distinguish a profile with @xmath37 of the total solar radius to one with @xmath38 of the solar radius . in the next section we use a maximum likelihood method to quantify the ability of neutrino experiments to separate electron angular profiles with different values of @xmath18 , such as shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , by exploiting the different distributions in @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "confidence regions to measure the central position @xmath18 and width @xmath41 of the region in which @xmath0b neutrinos are produced in the sun with neutrino - electron scattering , as a fraction of the total solar radius @xmath6 .",
    "we have generated simulated data with @xmath33 and @xmath20 , in line with expectations from solar modelling  @xcite , and have used a maximum likelihood method to quantify how well different distributions of electrons in a neutrino detector fit to this data.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in order to quantify the ability of neutrino experiments like super kamiokande to we have performed a maximum likelihood analysis , which compares simulated data to angular profiles of electrons scattered elastically by neutrinos under different assumptions for the size of @xmath18 and @xmath41 .",
    "we have generated simulated data by sampling from the angular distributions of scattered electrons , according to a number of events calculated using equation  ( [ eqn : rate ] ) with a cut on the electron recoil energy of @xmath42  mev .",
    "the simulated data is generated under the assumption that @xmath33 and @xmath20 , similar to expectations from solar modelling  @xcite .",
    "we then compare each simulated data - set to the theoretically expected angular profile of these electrons using a poisson likelihood for each value of @xmath18 .",
    "we have generated distributions from @xmath43 up to @xmath44 in steps of @xmath45 and from @xmath46 to @xmath47 in steps of @xmath48 .",
    "we neglect effects from time - variation of the neutrino flux  @xcite and all rates here are time - averaged .",
    "we have assumed an isotropic background rate similar to that observed in super kamiokande  @xcite , since it has been shown that a large background can inhibit the ability to accurately determine the incident direction of the neutrinos in the case of supernovae  @xcite .",
    "we also consider the spectral shape of this background in recoil energy based on results from the super kamiokande collaboration  @xcite .",
    "indeed if the rate of background events is comparable to the signal rate then the resolution of the detector can be significantly degraded .",
    "experiments looking for solar neutrinos , such as super kamiokande  @xcite , can measure the elastic scattering between neutrinos and electrons to obtain directional information on the neutrino source  @xcite .",
    "however this is made significantly more difficult since the resulting electrons scatter in the detector , leading to their measured angles of travel being only weakly correlated with those of the incident neutrinos .    in this work",
    "we have made quantitative projections for neutrino detectors with poor directional resolution , focusing on those based on detection of cerenkov light from electrons such as super kamiokande .",
    "we have determined the amount of data required to study the region within the sun in the sky from which the solar neutrinos originate , using the angular profile and energy spectrum of electrons scattered elastically by solar neutrinos .",
    "we have focused here on @xmath0b neutrinos , since these will produce the most events in water cerenkov detectors above their thresholds of around @xmath42  mev .",
    "solar models  @xcite predict that they originate from a spherical shell within the solar core with central position @xmath49 and width @xmath50 .",
    "hence we constrain both @xmath18 and @xmath41 using a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "this provides complimentary information to helioseismological measurements of the solar core  @xcite , and could help in solving the discrepancies between models of the sun and experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it could also be combined with information on neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] we have calculated the resulting angular profiles of electrons from @xmath0b solar neutrinos by using a landau distribution , which models the angular resolution of water cerenkov detectors such as super kamiokande  @xcite . using these distributions , at different recoil energies , we performed a maximum likelihood analysis to quantify how well @xmath18 and @xmath41 can be measured with a given experimental exposure , by fitting different profiles of scattered electrons as a function of scattering angle and recoil energy to simulated data .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : res_with_exposure ] .",
    "however it remains to be seen whether this is achievable for a real experiment , such as super kamiokande , as we have assumed that the only uncertainties on determining @xmath18 are due to the statistical effects brought on by the scattering of the electrons , assuming a somewhat idealised form for the distribution of these electrons .",
    "even so we have shown that if a detector has poor directional resolution it can still place useful constraints on the structure of the solar core using directional information , with the detection of a large number of neutrino events .",
    "hence a high - resolution image of the sun using neutrinos could open important new avenues for solar physics and neutrino physics .",
