    "the first empirical evidence of criticality in the brain was given by beggs and plenz , who reported that in vitro rat cortex slices exhibit neuronal avalanches with power law distribution with exponents -3/2 and -2 for avalanche size and duration , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this was regarded as evidence that the brain as a dynamical system fluctuates around a critical point , presumably similar to a critical branching process with the branching parameter close to unity . either on theoretical or experimental grounds ,",
    "this property has been shown to optimize computational capabilities  @xcite , information transmission  @xcite , sensitivity to stimuli and enlargement of dynamic range  @xcite , among others , as recently reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to explain the self - organization around the critical point , arcangelis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a model with synaptic depression and synaptic recovery ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "they obtained self - organized criticality ( soc ) and other very interesting results but their synaptic depression mechanism has the undesirable feature of depending on non - local information . in contrast , levina , herrmann and geisel ( lhg ) proposed a local model which consists of a fully connected network of integrate and fire neurons , such that when a neuron fires , the strength of its output links ( synapses ) is reduced by a fraction  @xcite .",
    "this fast dissipation mechanism has been associated with short - term synaptic depression due to temporary neurotransmitter vesicle depletion .",
    "it is countered by a recovery mechanism at a different time scale , by which synaptic neurotransmitters are slowly replenished when the synapse is idle .",
    "lhg claimed their model exhibit soc , based on the emergence of power - law distributions of avalanche sizes .    on a pair of review papers , however , bonachela _ et al .",
    "_ showed that for a system to exhibit soc its bulk dynamics must be conservative at least on average  .",
    "they showed that systems with dissipative and loading mechanisms such as the lhg model would hover around the critical point with nonvanishing fluctuations even in the thermodynamic limit . in that sense",
    ", the behavior of the lhg model would not be classified as soc , but rather was called self organized quasi - criticality ( soqc ) .",
    "indeed , the lhg model seems to pertain to the dynamical percolation universality class  @xcite and not to the directed percolation class as is usual in _ bona fide _ soc models .    in a recent work",
    ", we analyzed a random neighbor network of excitable cellular automata with dynamical synapses  @xcite .",
    "it was inspired by the lhg model , but with three different ingredients : finite connectivity ( with @xmath3 outgoing synapses in a random graph ) , discrete state units and multiplicative probabilistic synapses .",
    "in the so - called annealed version of the synaptic dynamics , when some neuron spikes , another neuron is chosen randomly in the network and its synapses are depressed .",
    "that is , there is no correlation between the firing locus and the synapses that are depressed .",
    "this artificial annealed procedure has been introduced because mean field calculations describes perfectly this case , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this model was shown to behave very differently from the lhg model , in that not only the stationary temporal average branching ratio @xmath4 converged to unity but , perhaps most importantly , the fluctuations around the criticality condition @xmath5 vanished in the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 .",
    "also , the associated phase transition is standard : continuous , with one absorbing state , and in the directed percolation universality class , as shown by simulations and mean - field results .",
    "despite the agreement between the mean - field calculations and the numerical simulations , a major drawback of the annealed model is its lack of biological plausibility .",
    "here we investigate in detail the quenched version of the model , in which , when a presynaptic neuron fires , only its outgoing synapses are depressed . in particular , we focus on whether the quenched model behaves similarly to the annealed model as far as soc is concerned .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we revisit the model , and in particular the differences between annealed and quenched synaptic dynamics . in section 3 , we present our simulation results and discussions . concluding remarks appear in section 4 .",
    "our model builds upon a random - neighbor network of excitable automata neurons [ quiescent ( @xmath7 ) , to firing ( @xmath8 ) , to refractory ( @xmath9 ) , to quiescent ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) ] used previously  @xcite . in this version , @xmath12 sites with states",

    "the adjacency matrix @xmath17 $ ] is fixed from the start and never changes , defining the neighborhood topology .",
    "this is not exactly a canonical erds - rnyi ( er ) network , which also has binomially distributed outlinks , but it is very close , so that we say that our networks have an er - like topology .    only for pairs that have @xmath18 we have probabilistic synapses @xmath19 .",
    "this means that , if presynaptic neuron @xmath20 fires , then , at the next time step , postsynaptic neuron @xmath21 fires with probability @xmath22 ( updates are done in parallel ) .",
    "since neuron @xmath21 has an average of @xmath3 presynaptic neighbors , there occurs an average of @xmath3 independent attempts .",
    "after a site spikes , it deterministically becomes refractory for @xmath23 time steps [ @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and then returns to quiescence @xmath28 ( for details , see ref .",
    "when the network falls in the absorbing state ( no firings ) , a randomly chosen site is forced to fire so that the network activity returns .",
    "the dynamics on the synapses can be of three kinds :    * the fixed case : @xmath22 are fixed , and never changes , as studied in ref .  @xcite ; * the quenched case : @xmath29 vary in time following a local rule that preserves spatial correlations ; * the annealed case : @xmath29 follow a global rule that does not preserve spatial correlations , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the quenched case ,",
    "the synapses obey the following equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coefficient of synaptic recovery , @xmath32 is the asymptotic synaptic value and @xmath33 is the fraction of coupling strength that is lost whenever a neuron fires , related to short time depletion of synaptic neurotransmissor vesicles  @xcite .",
    "the kronecker @xmath34 is one for @xmath35 and zero otherwise .",
    "this synaptic dynamics means that , whenever the neuron @xmath20 fires , all its outgoing synapses are reduced to basically to ( @xmath36 ) of their original value , since the second term is small .",
    "the exponent @xmath37 enable us to explore how the model behaves with different scalings for @xmath12 in the synaptic recovery dynamics .    for annealed dynamics , instead of depressing the @xmath3 outgoing synapses of the firing neuron @xmath20 ,",
    "either @xmath3 randomly chosen synapses are depressed or a random neuron is chosen and its @xmath3 outgoing synapses are depressed .",
    "the purpose of the annealed dynamics is to destroy correlations between the @xmath22 , so one can use mean - field analysis to get a better insight of the problem , as done previously  @xcite .",
    "we have tested both types of annealing , and they work equally well in destroying correlations , but the latter is computationally more efficient .    of course , from a realistic or biological point of view , the annealed case does not make sense , only the quenched dynamics . in any case , we must emphasize that both dynamics for @xmath29 never change the structure of the neighborhood given by @xmath38 , that is , both annealed and quenched dynamics take place on topologically er - like networks .",

    "indeed , this is the biologically realistic case since the recovery time can not depend on non - local information like the network size @xmath12 .",
    "our mean - field result predicts : @xmath168 where now @xmath169 $ ] . since @xmath170 now is always finite , the stationary value @xmath53 is always supercritical ( and we expect the same for @xmath68 ) .",
    "however , by using @xmath171 , say @xmath172 , and a biologically motivated value for the number of synapses ( @xmath173 ) , we obtain , for @xmath174 : @xmath175 which , although supercritical , seems to be sufficiently close to criticality to explain the experimental power laws in neuronal avalanches .",
    "notice that this mean - field result is also relevant to the quenched case since , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sigma - lambda - vs - uka]e , we have @xmath176 for large @xmath3 .",
    "this slight supercriticality has been called _ self - organized supercriticality _ ( sosc ) by brochini",
    "_ et al . _",
    "curiously , superavalanches ( the so called _ dragon kings _ ) and supercriticality have also been observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "this sosc scenario is new and merits a proper study , with intensive simulations as a function of the parametric space @xmath177 , not done here",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "the general criticality condition is @xmath2 , not @xmath71 .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath0 is a good predictor of criticality only for annealed synaptic dynamics , where correlations are destroyed by construction .",
    "but there is a relation between @xmath94 and @xmath0 ( for non - assortative networks , see  @xcite ) : @xmath178 where the correlation coefficient @xmath96 can be larger or smaller than one , depending on the kind of correlations between the in - links and the out - links of the nodes .    in our case",
    ", we found anti - correlation ( and thus @xmath102 ) , due to the fact that the avalanche dynamics induce that neurons with large sum of in - links fires more and so their out - links are more depressed ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "of course , this scenario is not static , the @xmath179 values vary with time , one can be larger than the other at some time and the converse can also be true at another time . it is the ensemble average over this whole process that gives the final value of @xmath96 .",
    "notice that our network with dynamic links ( and all other networks of the same kind  @xcite ) have two different aspects , self - organization and criticality , which are independent but sometimes confused in the literature :    * self - organization : this is simply a word that describes the transient evolution of the synaptic distribution @xmath180 from an initial condition @xmath181 toward a stationary distribution @xmath182 .",
    "this stationary distribution gives the final value for @xmath68 that is not necessarly the critical one ; * criticality : determination of some parametric volume that , at least in the @xmath6 limit , gives @xmath183 .",
    "for a _ bona fide _ definition of soc , this volume can not be of zero measure , that is , we can not have fine tuning . also , the fluctuations around @xmath68 must vanish for large networks ( that is , the network sits at , not hovers around , the critical point ) .    concerning self - organization , the proposed mechanism of synaptic depression , eq .",
    "( [ pij ] ) , consistently points to a convergence to a self - organized regime @xmath184 , both for annealed as well as for quenched dynamics .",
    "this self - organized value @xmath68 depends on the parameters @xmath80 and network size @xmath12 , and is not necessarily critical .    about criticality",
    ", the mean - field calculation suggests that there is a semi - infinite volume in the parameter space ( @xmath185 ) that produces soc behavior in the infinite size limit .",
    "this can be viewed in eq .",
    "( [ omega - n ] ) , where the dependence on all parameters ( @xmath186 ) vanishes for large @xmath12 ( if @xmath62 ) .",
    "this parametric volume is semi - infinite because low values of @xmath31 produce subcritical networks where eq .",
    "( [ omega - n ] ) is no more valid .",
    "so , the parametric space has two separated volumes : one subcritical and the other critical ( soc ) .",
    "both are large and generic . in the thermodynamic limit , there are no parameters that produce supercritical activity .",
    "intensive numerical simulations also lead us to the conclusion that , if we use an exponent @xmath187 , then there is a large volume in parameter space @xmath80 where @xmath188 when @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations of @xmath67 around @xmath68 , as measured e.g. by the standard deviation of @xmath189 , goes to zero as @xmath12 grows ( an important property not found in the lhg model  @xcite ) .",
    "so , both mean - field and simulations strongly suggest a well behaved soc scenario , at least in the thermodynamic limit , with the presence of a directed percolation absorbing phase transition like other standard soc models .    finally , the case with @xmath66 only produces self - organized supercriticality ( sosc  @xcite ) .",
    "however , for large number of synapses @xmath3 , as suggested by biology , networks which are almost critical are obtained , and this can be sufficient to deal with the power laws found in experiments . moreover , the sosc scenario suggests that biological neuronal networks could be indeed slightly supercritical , a fact perhaps masked by standard experiments with few electrodes but sometimes revealed in dragon king avalanches  @xcite .",
    "this sosc scenario ( exponent @xmath66 case ) should be studied more deeply in another publication .",
