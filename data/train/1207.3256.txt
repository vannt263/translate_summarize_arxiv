    "the nematic phase arises in liquids composed of sufficiently anisotropic particles ( molecules , colloidal particles , macroscopic grains ) from the isotropic phase when the density or concentration of particles ( or temperature in thermal liquids ) is above ( below ) some particular value @xcite . in nematics",
    ", particles are oriented on average along a common direction @xmath0 , called the _ director _ , but retain their positional disorder .",
    "the gain in orientational order that occurs when the isotropic phase transforms into the nematic phase proceeds via a phase transition which , in three dimensions , can be shown to be of first order , although weak . in this respect ,",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) nematics are peculiar , since symmetry restrictions on the orientational order parameter , discussed most conveniently in the context of a landau theory , allow for a more general nature of the phase transition : it can be of either first - order or continuous .    as is the case with three - dimensional nematics , in 2d point defects play an important role .",
    "point defects are points in the plane where the nematic director field @xmath1 is not defined ; there exists an associated region around the point defect where the director field is highly distorted from the uniform configuration @xmath2 const .",
    "the density field @xmath3 is also affected .",
    "another important aspect of nematics is that they are very sensitive to the presence of surfaces , so that they can be used to orient the director in some specific directions .",
    "finally , the broken rotational symmetry of nematics brings about an elasticity which , in two dimensions , is restricted to two independent elastic modes controlled by their corresponding elastic constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these three elements , defects , surfaces and elasticity , often compete together to give the final configuration of the nematic , which in many cases is highly nontrivial .",
    "similar to many other 2d systems , the nematic state in 2d presents anomalously large thermal fluctuations which result in a highly fluctuating nematic director . in case",
    "the free energy can be described by a one - elastic - constant , frank - type elastic model , @xmath6 [ where @xmath7 , the fluctuations in @xmath8 , the director tilt angle , depend on the number of particles @xmath9 as @xmath10 , with a vanishing order parameter in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath11 , and an orientational correlation function @xmath12 which decays algebraically rather than presenting long - range order .",
    "all of these properties imply that , strictly speaking , the ordered nematic phase does not exist in the thermodynamic limit , although the dependence is slow and even large nematic samples , or confined nematics , will be well ordered .",
    "as shown by onsager @xcite , overlap or exclusion interactions alone ( hard particles ) can explain the formation of the ordered nematic phase in two and three dimensions .",
    "in these systems , one defines particles with a specific shape , a convex body in the present work , and associates a potential energy to a pair of particles such that the energy is zero if particles do not overlap and infinity otherwise .",
    "overlapping configurations are thus discarded from the partition function , and the average energy is zero .",
    "order is controlled by the entropy : in the case of nematics , the orientational entropy , which favours disorder , is more than compensated by the exclusion configurational entropy , which increases as particles align along the director .",
    "this happens above some particular particle number density .",
    "popular hard models for nematic formation in two dimensions are shown in fig .",
    "they include : hard ellipses ( he ) , hard discorectangles ( hdr ) , and hard rectangles ( hr ) .",
    "the thermodynamics and phase behaviour of these models have been analysed using computer simulations . in the case of the he and hdr models two liquid phases",
    "are observed : the isotropic phase ( i ) , which exists at low density , and the uniaxial nematic phase ( n@xmath13 ) , at higher densities . in the n@xmath13 phase the continuous rotational symmetry of the i phase is broken and a definite average orientation appears in the fluid .",
    "the i - n@xmath13 transition is believed to be continuous and of the kosterlitz - thouless type @xcite .",
    "the hr model contains sharp corners and is close to being non - convex .",
    "this shape favours a new , exotic type of nematic , called the tetratic phase ( n@xmath14 ) @xcite . in the tetratic phase four equivalent directions , specified by two equivalent directors , arise .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a schematic of a typical particle configuration in the two nematic phases . also , the i - n transition in the hr fluid is highly non - trivial since its nature depends in a complicated way on the particle aspect ratio @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the rectangle length and @xmath17 the width ) .",
    "hints of the phase behaviour found for these fluids might also be observed in granular quasi - two - dimensional fluids made of anisotropic particles and subject to vertical motion @xcite .",

    "order parameters can then be defined , @xmath41 which measure respectively the usual nematic order and the tetratic order .",
    "the three fluid phases involved have the following order parameters : @xmath42 ( i ) ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( n@xmath13 ) ; and @xmath45 , @xmath44 ( n@xmath14 ) .    the spt phase diagram of the hr model in the @xmath28 vs. aspect ratio @xmath27 plane is shown in fig .",

    "there is a continuous i - n@xmath13 transition that becomes of first order as particles become less elongated .",

    "this point is discussed in sec .",
    "[ fmt ] .    finally , the fluid phase diagrams of the he and hdr models , not shown , are much simpler , since only the i and n@xmath13 phases are stable , with a continuous transition in the whole range of @xmath27 ( note that the phase diagrams of all models , he , hdr and hr , tend to be similar for large @xmath27 , and in fact identical in the limit @xmath48 ) .",
    "this result agrees with simulations @xcite .",
    "the only non - uniform phase present at high density is the crystal phase @xcite .",
    "spt only takes account of two - particle correlations .",
    "but higher - order correlations must be important in the stabilisation of the n@xmath14 phase .",
    "this is because , in typical n@xmath14-like arrangements and in order to obtain more optimised packings , particles tend to order in small clusters that involve a few particles pointing in perpendicular directions .",
    "because of this effect , higher - order correlations should extend the island of n@xmath14 stability to aspect ratios higher than @xmath49 and packing fractions lower than @xmath50 .    in @xcite we made an attempt to include three - particle correlations in a way that ( i ) incorporates three - body effects , and",
    "( ii ) reduces to the spt model when three - body correlations are switched off .",
    "the latter are included by means of the third virial coefficient , which is computed numerically as a function of the two order parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in effect",
    ", the new theory predicts a larger island of tetratic stability , with the aspect ratio where the tetratic phase ceases to be stable shifting to @xmath53 , and the line defining the i - n@xmath14 transition moving down to the range @xmath54@xmath55 .",
    "further inclusion of higher - order correlations will no doubt refine these results , although the formulation of new theories is difficult for lack of approximations for the higher - order virial coefficients and the intrinsic difficulties to deal with these coefficients .",
    "an alternative approach was followed in @xcite , where emphasis was focused on the strong clustering observed in the hr fluid .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that , because of particle shape and low dimensionality , particles tend to align parallel to their neighbours thus inducing the formation of large and persistent clusters that dominate the structure of the fluid .",
    "the clusters consist of parallel hard rectangles , side by side , say @xmath56 in number , which form a `` super - rectangle '' of length @xmath57 and width @xmath16 . with this fact in mind",
    ", the fluid can be viewed as a polydispersed mixture of super - rectangles of different lengths @xmath57 @xcite , and the extension of spt to mixtures can be applied .",
    "the only unknown quantity in the problem is the distribution of cluster sizes , given by @xmath58 . assuming this function to be exponential , @xmath59 ( which follows from a chemical mass - action law , an assumption which is supported by simulation ) , we obtain @xmath60 from mc simulation and predict the phase behaviour .",

    "we have just seen that 2d particles possessing anisometric shape can form nematic phases .",
    "depending on the particle geometry the nematic phase can occur in two varieties , the uniaxial and the tetratic nematic phases , but the latter exists only for low aspect ratios .",

    "the absence of strict long - range orientational order in 2d nematics , their strong fluctuations and non - standard transition to the isotropic phase add difficulties in the effort to reach a deeper understanding of this problem ; clearly , more sophisticated theories and additional computer simulations are needed .",
    "on the other hand , 2d nematic are a useful testbed to understand the formation of defects in confined geometries and also the subtle commensuration effects , combining surface , bulk , elastic and defect energies , that operate in confined systems .",

    "<S> two - dimensional nematics possess peculiar properties that have been studied recently using computer simulation and various theoretical models . here </S>",
    "<S> we review our own contribution to the field using density - functional theory , and present some preliminary simulation results on confined two - dimensional nematics . </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss the possible stable bulk phases and phase diagrams and the relation between phases and particle geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we then explore the adsorption properties on a single substrate and the confinement effects that arise when the fluid is confined between parallel walls . </S>",
    "<S> next , confinement in circular cavities is presented ; this geometry allows us to measure some properties of the simplest defects that arise in two - dimensional nematics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , preliminary monte carlo simulation results of confined nematics in circular geometry are shown . </S>"
