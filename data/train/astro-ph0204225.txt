    "extrasolar transiting planets are suitable for a variety of followup measurements while they transit their parent star . many of the followup measurements would aim to detect additional planet components that block light from the parent star , such as moons , rings , or the planet s atmosphere .",
    "recently , the atmosphere of the transiting planet hd  209458  b was detected in transmission in the neutral sodium resonance line ( charbonneau et al .",
    "a followup measurement of a transiting planet s albedo and phase curve would also be very useful in constraining atmosphere properties since both the radius and orbital inclination ( @xmath10 ) are known ( seager , whitney , & sasselov 2000 ) .",
    "here we describe an additional planet property that can be derived from followup measurements of transiting extrasolar planets : the planet s projected oblateness .",
    "the oblateness is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the planet s equatorial radius and @xmath13 the planet s polar radius .",
    "the solar system gas giants all have a significant oblateness , ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 , due to their rapid rotation .",
    "saturn s oblateness is so large it is obvious from whole - planet images .",
    "an oblateness detection would immediately tell us that a planet is a rapid rotator .",
    "a planet s oblateness signature on a transit light curve was first described in hui & seager ( 2002 ) .",
    "the oblateness signature is expected to be small .",
    "however , recent observations by hst / stis ( brown et al . 2001 )",
    "reached an unprecedented photometric precision of @xmath6 , and space telescopes most ( canadian space agency ; launch date december 2002 ) , mons ( danish space agency ; launch date @xmath14 2004 ) , corot ( french space agency , european space agency , launch date 2004 ) , and kepler ( nasa ; launch date 2006 ) are designed to reach photometric precision of a few@xmath15 by averaging measurements over several orbital periods .",
    "kepler , a wide - field transit search with the main goal of detecting earth - sized planets orbiting solar type stars , expects to find 3040 transiting extrasolar giant planets . with the prospect of high photometric precision",
    ", we investigate the transit signature of an oblate giant planet and the constraints on an oblate extrasolar planet s rotational period and tidal @xmath3 value .",
    "here we review the relation between oblateness and rotational period ( see e.g. collins 1963 ; van belle et al .",
    "2001 ) , making the simplest assumptions about the structure of the planets in question .",
    "the potential for a uniformly rotating body has two terms , gravitational and rotational .",
    "the gravitational potential for a rotating , not too aspherical , figure of equilibrium can be expanded using the legendre polynomials ( see e.g. danby 1962 ; chandrasekhar 1969 ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the planet mass , @xmath19 is the planet surface radius , @xmath20 is a constant coefficient , and @xmath21 is the angle measured from the planet s rotation axis .",
    "the gravitational moments , of which @xmath20 is an example , describe the structure and shape of a rotating fluid and are measured for the solar system planets by precession rates of satellite and ring orbits and by spacecraft trajectories .",
    "the gravitational moments are not known for extrasolar planets , but they generally contribute small corrections to the gravitational potential . here , we keep only the first term of equation  ( [ eq : gravpot ] ) , the gravitational potential of a point mass .",
    "the rotational potential @xmath22 arises from the force of centripetal acceleration . for a rigid body rotating at angular velocity @xmath23 about the @xmath24 axis",
    ", @xmath25 where the right hand side term is in spherical polar coordinates , and for axisymmetric rotation @xmath26 .",
    "hence the total potential @xmath27 for a rigid rotator with a gravitational point mass potential is @xmath28 we can use the fact that the total potential @xmath29 is constant on the surface ( eddington 1926 ) to consider that @xmath29 at the pole ( @xmath30 ) and at the equator ( @xmath31 ) are the same",
    ". then equation  ( [ eq : phitotal ] ) can be written as , @xmath32 where the polar radius @xmath13 corresponds to the rotation axis @xmath24 , and @xmath12 is the equatorial radius .",
    "then considering the definition of oblateness , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the rotational period @xmath35 is @xmath36 note that with @xmath37 as the eccentricity ( hereafter called ellipticity to avoid confusion with eccentricity of the planet s orbit ) of an ellipse , @xmath38 , and so @xmath39    the maximum oblateness can be estimated by considering the centripetal acceleration for a given planet mass and radius that can prevent the body from flying apart , ( again , ignoring higher order terms in the gravitational potential ) . considering a particle at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and considering the relation between the angular velocity @xmath43 and the oblateness @xmath44 ( equation  ( [ eq : omegasq ] ) ) , the maximum possible oblateness is @xmath45 , which corresponds to an ellipticity of @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear , considering equation  ( [ eq : period ] ) , that a measurement of the oblateness @xmath44 , together with the measurement of @xmath18 and @xmath47 ( here defined as @xmath48 ) from the transit photometry and radial velocity data , will yield the planet s rotational period , subject to two considerations .",
    "the first is that the @xmath49 is expected to deviate from a point mass potential , since the solar system gas giant planets have non - zero @xmath20 and higher order moments .",
    "secondly only the projected oblateness can be measured and hence only an upper limit on the rotational period can be obtained . to be precise ,",
    "suppose the three - dimensional ellipticity is @xmath37 , the projected ellipticity equals @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle between the axis of planet rotation and the line of sight to the planet ( see appendix a of hui & seager 2002 ) . to the extent the angle @xmath51 is random , one expects on average that the projected ellipticity is half the actual value .",
    "the projected oblateness can be obtained from the projected ellipticity using the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath37 in equation  ( [ eq : equiv ] ) .",
    "_ hereafter , whenever we refer to ellipticity @xmath37 or oblateness @xmath44 , we mean its projected version , unless otherwise stated . _",
    "planetary oblateness is caused by rapid rotation .",
    "planets that rotate synchronously with their orbital period will generally be rotating too slowly to be significantly oblate . therefore , the tidal evolution timescale for synchronous rotation will limit the parameter space  mainly the orbital semi - major axis @xmath52where oblate planets are expected to be found .",
    "conversely , a detection of oblateness for a planet together with an estimation of the system s age could help to constrain the planet s tidal dissipation factor @xmath3 ( we will refer to it as @xmath53 here ) .",
    "the synchronous rotation timescale is ( e.g. goldreich & soter 1966 ; zahn 1977 ; hubbard 1984 ; guillot et al .",
    "1996 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the planet s primordial rotational angular velocity and @xmath57 its orbital angular velocity , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the star s radius and mass , and @xmath17 is the universal gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath53 is inversely related to the tidal dissipation energy . for a jupiter - like planet ( with jupiter s tidal @xmath60 ( ioannou & lindzen 1993 ) and jupiter s current rotation rate @xmath61h ) orbiting at 0.05  au around a solar twin , @xmath62 years . for hd  209458  b , with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , ( cody & sasselov 2001 ; brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath66 ( mazeh et al . 2000 ) , @xmath67 years . because hd  209458  b has @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the age of the parent star )",
    ", synchronous rotation is expected to have been reached .",
    "note that planets of jupiter s mass , @xmath53 , and @xmath70 orbiting a sun - mass star with @xmath71 au will be synchronous rotators .",
    "the tidal synchronization timescale has as its main uncertainty @xmath53 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is interesting to compare @xmath72 with the typical ages of stars ( @xmath69 ) with known extrasolar planets : one to a few billion years .",
    "figure  [ fig : summary]a shows @xmath72 as a function of @xmath52 and @xmath73 to illustrate that planets with @xmath74 to @xmath75  au have @xmath72 similar to these typical ages of stars with known planets . of the parameters in equation  ( [ eq : sync ] )",
    ", @xmath76 can be measured for a transiting planet and @xmath59 can be well estimated .",
    "therefore @xmath53 can be constrained with : an oblateness measurement as evidence for non - synchronous rotation ; an assumption for @xmath56 ; a planet with @xmath52 such that @xmath77 .",
    "( note that @xmath53 can also be constrained by considering the tidal evolution time for tidal circularization , but in this case the values for @xmath18 and @xmath47 in specific cases are not known . )    in addition to the planet s rotation rate , other orbital parameters will evolve as a consequence of tides raised on the planet by the star .",
    "the orbital circularization timescale ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) and the timescale for co - planarity ( defined as the coincidence of the planet orbital plane and the stellar equatorial plane ) are both longer than the synchronous rotation timescale ( rasio et al . 1966 ; hut 1981 ) .",
    "the planet s projected obliquity , @xmath78 ( defined here as the _ projected _ angle of inclination of the planet s rotation axis to the planet s orbit normal ) is measurable for a transiting oblate planet ( see  [ sec - results ] ) that has an orbital inclination different from 90@xmath5 .",
    "the planet s obliquity is also affected by tidal evolution .",
    "the timescale for tidal evolution to zero obliquity is the same as the tidal synchronous rotation timescale for a planet in a circular orbit ( peale 1999 ) . for eccentric orbits",
    "the obliquity evolution is complex and coupled to other orbital evolution timescales ( peale 1999 ) .",
    "however , a detection of obliquity together with other measured orbital and physical parameters for a planet in the tidal evolution regime will be useful to constrain the planet s evolutionary history .",
    "note that a planet may escape evolving to synchronous rotation ( or to a circular orbit and zero obliquity ) in the presence of other nearby planets .",
    "hd  83443 ( mayor et al . 2002 ) is an interesting example described in wu & goldreich ( 2002 ) .",
    "we want to determine the shape and magnitude of the transit light curve due to an oblate planet with different values of projected obliquity .",
    "because the effect is small compared to a spherical planet transit , the transit light curve must be computed to high accuracy , @xmath79 , in order to accurately calculate effects at the @xmath80 level .",
    "we use planetocentric coordinates and consider the projected oblate planet to be an ellipse .",
    "the planet s surface is described by the ellipse equation in polar coordinates , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the distance from planet center and @xmath83 is measured from the projected orbit normal . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the star s surface is represented by @xmath84 where @xmath57 is the orbital angular velocity , @xmath85 is time , and @xmath86 is the time of transit center .",
    "we consider the intersection of the equations for the planet and star in order to determine ( 1 ) start and end of ingress and egress and ( 2 ) integration limits for the star area blocked by the planet",
    ".      the oblateness signature on a transit light curve will be small . in order to quantify the shape and magnitude of the oblate planet s transit signature we compare an oblate planet transit light curve ( @xmath87 ) to a spherical planet transit light curve ( @xmath88 ) for planets of the same projected area transiting the same sized star .",
    "we define @xmath89 $ ] where @xmath90 is the flux difference is different from that in hui & seager ( 2002 ) . ] between a spherical planet ( projected to a disk ) and an oblate planet ( projected to an ellipse ) transit light curve .",
    "the ellipse and projected sphere are always chosen to have the same total area i.e. the minimum of @xmath88 and the minimum of @xmath87 are the same in the absence of limb darkening .",
    "each transit light curve is normalized to the stellar flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : summary]b shows the maximum value of @xmath90 for different @xmath37 and @xmath91 .",
    "the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 are chosen for this figure  as we will see , this gives the weakest oblateness signature , and so the contours in figure  [ fig : summary]b give conservative estimates of the required photometric precision to detect oblateness .    the transit light curve of a jupiter - sized",
    "planet transiting a sun - sized star with orbital inclination @xmath92 is shown in figure  [ fig : ellipse]a .",
    "the round - bottomed transit is due to limb darkening , in this case the solar limb - darkening value at 450  nm is used ( cox 2000 ) . at this blue wavelength the sun is strongly limb darkened .",
    "the flat - bottomed transit was computed neglecting limb darkening , or in a very non - limb - darkened color ( e.g. at ir wavelengths , although solar limb darkening is minor at @xmath94 band ) chosen to illustrate the range of possibilities . on the scale in figure  [ fig : ellipse]a ,",
    "transits due to oblate and spherical planets are difficult to tell apart ; we show their difference in subsequent panels . in figure",
    "[ fig : ellipse ] and in this subsection we consider planets with the same area as jupiter . because jupiter is oblate ( with @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , jupiter s area corresponds to a sphere with effective radius @xmath97 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipse]b shows the flux difference @xmath98 $ ] between the non - limb - darkened transit light curve of a spherical planet and an oblate planet with ellipticity @xmath37 varying from 0.1 to 0.4 .",
    "these transit light curves were computed for an orbital distance @xmath99 , but for the case of @xmath92 the transit time scales as @xmath100 .",
    "the flux difference @xmath90 in figure  [ fig : ellipse]b is as high as 1.5@xmath101 for an planet with ellipticity @xmath102 , corresponding to the oblateness of saturn .    the oblate planet transit signature can be explained as follows . at the start of ingress ,",
    "when just a small fraction of the planet has crossed the stellar limb , an oblate planet ( projected to an ellipse ) covers less area on the stellar disk than a sphere ( projected to a disk ) .",
    "hence @xmath90 ( which is actually the flux difference of the light deficit of a disk and ellipse ) is higher .",
    "as ingress progresses , the area of the star blocked by an oblate planet decreases compared to the sphere , until the ingress midpoint . at the midpoint of ingress ,",
    "when the planet center coincides with the stellar limb , the area of the stellar disk that is blocked is roughly the same for an ellipse and a sphere ( except for the deviation of the star limb from a straight line ) ; hence the fractional difference at mid - ingress is close to zero .",
    "( @xmath103 at mid - ingress or mid - egress only for @xmath92 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "the difference @xmath90 also eventually reaches around @xmath105 towards the middle of the transit between ingress and egress . another way to consider",
    "the oblate transit signature is that for an oblate planet ( with larger @xmath12 than a spherical one of the same area ) , the `` first contact '' will occur earlier , and the `` second contact '' will occur later , thus explaining the sign of the difference signal @xmath90 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipse]c shows the same flux differences ( @xmath90s ) as in figure  [ fig : ellipse]b , but at the highly - limb - darkened color of 450  nm . in the presence of strong limb darkening ,",
    "the maximum value of the oblateness signature at ingress / egress is lower than in the case of no limb darkening ( figure  [ fig : ellipse]b ) .",
    "this is because ingress and egress occur at the stellar limb where a given area takes out less luminosity than from closer to star center .",
    "because of limb darkening the planet transit light curve is asymmetric around mid - ingress . while this is also true for a spherical planet , the effect is exaggerated for an ellipse .",
    "limb darkening also causes a flux difference between an oblate and spherical planet when the planet is fully superimposed on the parent star ; however this difference is negligible compared to the oblateness signature at ingress and egress .    in all of the above cases ,",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipse]a - c , @xmath106 and @xmath107 is assumed .",
    "an oblate planet with @xmath108 and non - zero projected obliquity @xmath78 has an interesting transit light curve .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipse]d shows the transit light curve for different orbital inclinations ( neglecting limb darkening ) .",
    "the dot - dashed line at @xmath109 shows an almost grazing planet transit .",
    "the transit light curves of an oblate planet and of a spherical planet are indistinguishable on the scale of figure  [ fig : ellipse]d .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipse]e and figure  [ fig : ellipse]f show @xmath90 , the flux difference in the transit light curve between a spherical planet and an oblate planet with @xmath110 for various orbital inclinations .",
    "note that ingress and egress last longer for transits with larger @xmath111 , making the oblateness signature easier to measure .",
    "the ingress and egress oblateness signatures are completely symmetric about mid - transit ( i.e. @xmath112 ) for projected obliquity @xmath93 ( cases shown in figure  [ fig : ellipse]c ) .",
    "the oblateness signature will be more easily measured from a transit light curve that is asymmetric about mid - transit in its ingress and egress .",
    "such an asymmetry will occur in the case of an oblate planet with a non - zero obliquity and with orbital inclination different from 90@xmath5 .",
    "the asymmetry is apparent in comparing figures  [ fig : ellipse]b and [ fig : ellipse]e .",
    "figures  [ fig : asym]a and b show the asymmetric flux difference @xmath113 $ ] for different cases of @xmath10 and @xmath78 . the oblate planet considered in figure  [ fig : asym ]",
    "has @xmath102 and the same area as jupiter .",
    "reaching amplitudes of @xmath114 these are close to the current best precision photometry ( from hst ) .",
    "the signatures in figure  [ fig : asym ] can be considered maximum signatures using solar system values .    in summary",
    ", there are _ two _ oblateness signatures one can look for : 1 ) a detailed difference in light curves between a transit by a sphere and a transit by an ellipse , around ingress and around egress ; and 2 ) an asymmetry of the light curve between ingress and egress in the case of non - zero projected obliquity @xmath78 and @xmath115 . @xmath78 and @xmath37 are not degenerate and can both be extracted from a fit to the light curve . when both signatures can be detected , one can obtain constraints on obliquity as well as oblateness .",
    "we expect to be able to distinguish the oblateness transit signature from other similar magnitude effects during transits .",
    "planetary moons could affect the planet transit light curve but , due to their size , shape , and projected separation from the planet , would not mimic planet oblateness ( although they could still cause a transit light curve asymmetry ) .",
    "planetary rings will be projected into an ellipse unless the inclination of the planet s ring plane to the line of sight is either @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "with a few parts - per - million photometric precision , most cases of planetary rings should not be confused with the oblateness signature because the rings have a relatively large radius and a slightly different transit signature than an oblate planet .",
    "a planet mass measurement ( by radial velocity observations and by the transit to give @xmath10 ) would likely alleviate any confusion due to transiting rings ( which would make the planet look much larger ) due to the giant planet mass - radius relationship ( guillot et al .",
    "atmospheric lensing ( hui & seager 2002 ) due to a spherical planet may be confused with the oblateness signature .",
    "however at wavelengths where the planet s atmosphere is strongly absorbing atmospheric lensing is not present .",
    "in addition the transit asymmetry due to a non - zero @xmath78 is not reproducible by atmospheric lensing .",
    "confusion at the @xmath7 level from other signals such as star spots , large planetary features , etc .",
    "are unlikely and are discussed in hui & seager ( 2002 ) .",
    "recently brown et al . ( 2001 ) used hst / stis to measure the transit light curve of hd  209458  b , the only currently known transiting extrasolar planet ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; henry et al .",
    "the resulting photometric precision is at a level of @xmath6 .",
    "this level of precision is not high enough to measure the expected oblateness of hd  209458  b. the close - in extrasolar giant planets like hd  209458  b are not expected to be significantly oblate due to slow rotational periods resulting from tidal locking to their orbital revolution . assuming synchronous rotation an orbital period of 3.5 days corresponds to an oblateness of 0.0018 ( @xmath118 ) , considering hd  209458  b to be a rigid rotator with @xmath66 ( mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath119 ( the most recent derivation from cody & sasselov 2001 ) .",
    "at an orbital inclination of 86.1@xmath5 the flux difference from a transit light curve of a sphere has a maximum amplitude of only a few @xmath15 . if hd  209458  b has a non - zero projected obliquity ( @xmath78 ) , the asymmetry of ingress to egress could be as high as 8@xmath15 .",
    "such an obliquity is not expected , however , due to tidal evolution .",
    "obtaining an upper limit for @xmath37 and @xmath78 for hd  209458  b by a fit to a high - precision transit light curve would observationally confirm the expected slow rotational period for hd  209458  b.      the four solar system gas giant planets have significant oblateness , with values listed in table  1 ( note that oblateness here is the actual oblateness in three dimensions , i.e. not a projected value ) . with the exception of jupiter",
    ", they all have substantial obliquity with values that are consistent with random @xmath78 .",
    "the solar system gas giant planets have measured rotational periods from 9.92  h to 17.24  h ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the rotational periods as calculated from equation  ( [ eq : period ] ) using the measured oblateness values are within 20% or less of the actual rotational periods .",
    "the estimated rotational periods are consistently low , due to the neglect of the higher order gravitational moments in the gravitational potential ( equation  ( [ eq : gravpot ] ) )",
    ".    for extrasolar planet transit measurements only the projected oblateness can be measured , and hence only an upper limit on the rotational period can be obtained . with a measurement of the rotation rate together with the projected oblateness",
    "@xmath78 could be constrained .",
    "the rotational period could be directly measurable with the next generation of radio telescopes for jupiter - like planets with high synchrotron emission ( like jupiter ) ( bastian , dulk , & leblanc 2000 ) .",
    "note that spectral line measurements may give information on winds in the planet atmosphere rather than the planet s rotation rate .",
    "an oblate planet and a spherical planet of jupiter s area orbiting a sun - like star will have different ingress and egress transit light curves by as much as a few to 15 @xmath4 .",
    "a planet s oblateness is most easily detectable in the case where the planet s orbital inclination is different from edge - on , and the planet s projected obliquity is substantially different from zero . in this case",
    "the transit light curve is asymmetric between the ingress and egress ( see figure  [ fig : coord ] and figure  [ fig : asym ] ) , a signature that can be detected by folding the light curve around mid - transit .",
    "the oblateness signature due to a planet with zero projected obliquity is symmetric in ingress and egress ; the oblateness can then be measured using a model fit to the data ( by exploiting the detailed differences in the light curves produced by a sphere and an ellipse ; see figure  [ fig : summary ] ) .",
