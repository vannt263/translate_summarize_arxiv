    "let @xmath0 be a noetherian local ring and @xmath2 the grothendieck group of finitely generated @xmath0-modules . using euler characteristic of perfect complexes with finite length homologies ( a generalized version of serre s intersection multiplicity pairings ) , one could define the notion of _ numerical equivalence _ on @xmath2 as in @xcite .",
    "see section [ sec2 ] for precise definitions .",
    "when @xmath0 is the local ring at the vertex of an affine cone over a smooth projective variety @xmath3 , this notion can be deeply related to that of numerical equivalences on the chow group of @xmath3 as in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "thus , maximal cohen - macaulay modules all survive in @xmath4 , and it makes sense to talk about the cone of cohen - macaulay modules inside @xmath6 :    @xmath7 \\subset \\overline{g_0(r)}_{\\bbb r}.\\ ] ] the definition of this cone and some of its basic properties was given in @xcite .",
    "understanding the cohen - macaulay cone is quite challenging , as it encodes a lot of non - trivial information about both the category of maximal cohen - macaulay modules and the local intersection theory on @xmath0 .",
    "for example , let s consider the hypersurface @xmath8/(xy - uv)$ ] .",
    "then , the main result of @xcite tells us that @xmath6 is two dimensional , and one can pick a basis consisting of @xmath9 $ ] ( vertical ) and @xmath10 $ ] ( horizontal ) .",
    "since the maximal cohen - macaulau modules are completely classified ( @xcite ) , one can compute the cohen - macaulay cone of the as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is the blue region between the rays from the origin to the points represented by the modules @xmath11 and @xmath12 . later in the paper ( section [ cmcones ] we shall compute these cones for a big class of hypersurface singularities .",

    "this has some surprising consequences , which we now describe .",
    "the first consequence is that given any integer @xmath14 , the set of isomorphism classes of maximal cohen - macaulay modules of rank @xmath14 up to numerical equivalence is finite ( theorem [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "this is interesting as results from cohen - macaulay representation theory tells us that the set of these modules in any given rank is typically very big ( see @xcite or @xcite for some nice introduction to this topic . when @xmath15 , our results confirm a number of cases when the set of cohen - macaulay ideals are actually finite .",
    "this is raised in a question attributed to hochster , which we discuss in details in section [ sechoch ] .",
    "in section [ 4.1 ] we study when the map @xmath16 has finite kernel .",
    "this turns out to be a rather subtle question , even when @xmath0 is the localization at the vertex of a cone over a smooth projective variety .",
    "however , we are able to prove that the map is an isomorphism for most isolated hypersurface singularities of dimension @xmath17 ( proposition [ 1.6 ] ) .    finally , in section [ cmcones ] we describe explicitly the cohen - macaulay cone for a class of local hypersurfaces defined by a power series of the form @xmath1 .",
    "these are first examples of non - trivial cohen - macaulay cones in higher dimensions over rings not of finite cohen - macaulay type , and the mere fact that they can actually be computed even for this special class of singularities is quite encouraging .    in an upcoming paper",
