    "_ sierpiski carpets _ are self - similar fractals in the plane that originate from the sierpiski carpet@xcite and are constructed in the following way : start with the unit square , divide it into @xmath3 congruent smaller subsquares and cut out @xmath4 of them , corresponding to a given @xmath3 pattern ( called the generator of the sierpiski carpet ) .",
    "this construction step is repeated with all the remaining subsquares ad infinitum .",
    "the resulting object is a fractal of hausdorff and box - counting dimension @xmath5 , called a _ _ sierpiski carpet__@xcite . at each step of the iterative construction",
    "the corresponding squares are deleted , together with their boundary , and then the closure ( with respect to the topology induced by the euclidean metric in the plane ) is taken .",
    "sierpiski carpets have been used , e.g. , as models for porous materials @xcite .",
    "the `` cantor dust '' ( see , e.g. , falconer@xcite ) is an example of a totally disconnected sierpiski carpet , for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in the present paper , we study planar sets that generalise the sierpiski carpets mentioned before , namely _ generalised sierpiski carpets _ ( which we sometimes call , in short , _ generalised carpets _ ) .",
    "a generalised sierpiski carpet differs from a sierpiski carpet defined as above slightly in the construction and in the following aspects . at step @xmath0 of the construction , for any @xmath1",
    ", we apply an @xmath8 pattern , where @xmath9 , for all @xmath10 , and , at any two steps @xmath11 we may have distinct patterns , with @xmath12 .    in a very recent paper cristea and",
    "steinsky@xcite presented necessary and sufficient conditions , under which generalised sierpiski carpets are connected , with respect to euclidean topology .",
    "hata@xcite studied connectedness properties of self similar fractals , and cristea@xcite studied connectedness properties of fractals , that are , under certain conditions , a special case of the generalised sierpiski carpets analysed in the present paper .",
    "now , we give a short outline of this paper . in the next section we present the construction of generalised sierpiski carpets by means of _ patterns _ , and several definitions of notions that occur throughout this paper . in section [ sec : families_of_patterns ] we introduce six special families of patterns which occur in the considerations of the sections to follow .",
    "section [ sec : structure ] consists of results about the effect of these patterns on the structure of generalised sierpiski carpets .",
    "we show a somewhat `` periodic '' structure of the ( complements of ) the sets at the @xmath0th iteration in the construction of generalised carpets , for @xmath1 . in section [ sec : totally_disconnected ] we prove our main result , which gives sufficient conditions for generalised sierpiski carpets to be totally disconnected .",
