    "grover s quantum search algorithm is a quantum algorithm which provides a quadratic speed - up when compared to the optimal classical search algorithms for unsorted database .",
    "when implemented on a multipartite quantum system ( @xmath0-qudit ) , it generates an entangled state after its first iteration ( the advantage of implementing grover s algorithm on a multipartite quantum system instead of a single @xmath1-dit hilbert space is discussed by meyer @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of this entanglement has been investigated numerically by various authors @xcite by computing different measures of entanglement .",
    "for instance in the work of rossi _ et al _ @xcite one can find numerical computations of the geometric measure of entanglement ( gme ) either as a function of the number of iterations for a fixed number of qubits @xcite or as a function of the number of qubits when we only consider the first iteration of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "those numerical approaches have the advantage to draw attention to the behavior of the algorithm and raise natural questions : when does the algorithm reach its maximum of entanglement",
    "? how does it behave with several marked elements ? in this note",
    "we will consider the same questions but from a different perspective , i.e. without any numerical approach .",
    "we want to understand , in a more qualitative sense , which types of entangled states are generated by the algorithm .",
    "more precisely using the geometric description of entanglement classes provided by auxiliary algebraic varieties ( @xcite ) we try to understand which stratas can be reached ( or not ) by the algorithm .",
    "let us recall some notations and a couple of definitions used in @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath2 the hilbert space of states composed of @xmath3 particles , each being a @xmath4-dits .",
    "denote by @xmath5 a basis of @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "a pure quantum state @xmath8 can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are complex amplitudes such that @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the standard basis of @xmath13 .",
    "this basis will be denoted latter on by @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath13 is a @xmath0-qubit hilbert space , we will also use the decimal notation for the basis , i.e the state @xmath14 will be denoted by @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "quantum states are uniquely determined up to a phase and the normalization factor does not provide meaningfull information",
    ". therefore we can consider pure quantum states @xmath18 as points in the projectivized hilbert space @xmath19\\in \\pp(\\mathcal{h})$ ] .",
    "the complex semi - simple lie group @xmath20 acts irreductibly on @xmath13 ( @xmath13 is a @xmath21-module ) .",
    "the group @xmath21 is well - known in quantum information theory as the group of ( reversible ) stochastic local quantum operations assisted by classical communication ( slocc @xcite )",
    ". under slocc two states are equivalent if they are interconvertible by the action of @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath21-module @xmath13 has a unique highest weight vector which can be chosen to be @xmath22 ( it corresponds to a choice of orientation for the weight lattice @xcite ) .",
    "the orbit @xmath23 is the unique closed orbit for the action of @xmath21 on @xmath13 and it defines , after projectivization , a smooth projective algebraic variety defined by the zero locus of a collection of homogeneous polynomials . ] @xmath24 .",

    "we recall basic facts about grover s algorithm and we make a usefull observation about the tensor rank of the states generated by the algorithm . in section [ secant ]",
    "we use our observation to establish a first connection with auxiliary varieties .",
    "we show that for single marked element search , the algorithm always generates states which belong to the secant variety of the set of separable states .",
    "our interpretation of the states generated by grover s algorithm in terms of secant varieties leads us to a qualitative interpretation of the numerical computation of the gme proposed in @xcite .",
    "in particular we explain in section [ rossinum ] why the maximum of entanglement is obtained in @xcite for specific values of @xmath3 .",
    "we prove that , asymptotically , if @xmath37 is a set of orthogonal marked elements , the maximum of the gme is achieved after @xmath38 iterations ( theorem [ maintheorem ] ) where @xmath39 denotes the optimal number of iterations to be run before measurement .",
    "we also make a connection between the gme of the quantum state generated after the first iteration as a function of the number of qubits as calculated in @xcite and the relative dimension of the corresponding auxiliary variety involved in our description .",
    "finaly in section [ tripartite ] and appendix [ a ] , we describe explicitly all types of entangled classes reached by grover s algorithm in geometrical terms for single and multiple marked elements search in the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 systems .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "we first recall the principle of grover s algorithm @xcite when implemented on a @xmath0-qubit system .",
    "the algorithm starts with a @xmath0-qubit state whose registers are initialy on state @xmath43 , i.e. the initial state is @xmath44 . employing a hadamard gate on each register @xmath45",
    "one obtains the state corresponding to the superposition of all states of the computational basis @xmath46 .",
    "then the algorithm operates iteratively the so - called grover gate @xmath47 which is composed of two gates , the oracle @xmath48 and the diffusion @xmath49 :    * the oracle corresponds to the unitary operator @xmath50 where @xmath37 is the set of elements in the computational basis which are sought and `` recognized '' by the oracle . when applied on a @xmath0-qubit state @xmath51 , the @xmath48 gate signs the searched elements , @xmath52 . *",
    "the diffustion gate @xmath49 can be written as a unitary operator as @xmath53 .",
    "this gate is also called inversion about the mean operation , it can be checked that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the mean of the amplitudes @xmath56 .",
    "the algorithm can be encoded as a circuit ( figure [ circuit ] ) .",
    "@xmath57    after @xmath3-iterations the quantum state generated by grover s algortihm is @xmath58    with @xmath59 and @xmath60 real numbers such that @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be such that @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 for @xmath65 small compared to @xmath66 .",
    "then we can write ( see @xcite page 182 ) : @xmath67 this expression allows one to get the optimal number of iterations to get the highest possible probabilty to measure an element of @xmath37 .",
    "indeed the probability to obtain @xmath68 after a measurement of @xmath69 in the computational basis is @xmath70 .",
    "it will be optimal for @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72\\ ] ] where @xmath73 denotes the nearest integer function .",
    "eq ( [ optimal ] ) shows the quadratic speed up of the algorithm . for a database of @xmath74 elements ,",
    "if there is only one element sought ( @xmath75 ) then the complexity of the algorithm is @xmath76 compared to @xmath77 in all classical algorithms .",
    "implemented on a multi - dits hilbert space @xmath78 , the states @xmath69 are tensors .",
    "when we deal with tensors one of the first attribute to consider is the rank @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , tensor rank should be considered as an algebraic measure of entanglement .",
    "let @xmath13 be a hilbert space obtained as tensor product of finite dimensional hilbert spaces , i.e. @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",

    "it is clear from the definition that for pure muti - qudits system , rank one tensors correspond to separable states and every tensors which are not of rank one should be considered as entangled .",
    "thus in order to study the entanglement generated by grover s algorithm it is natural to ask what is the rank of the entangled states @xmath69 of eq ( [ state ] ) . the next observation will be essential in what follows .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the entanglement nature of quantum states generated by grover s search algorithm by means of algebraic geometry . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely we establish a link between entanglement of states generated by the algorithm and auxiliary algebraic varieties built from the set of separable states . </S>",
    "<S> this new perspective enables us to propose qualitative interpretations of earlier numerical results obtained by m. rossi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. we also illustrate our purpose with a couple of examples investigated in details . </S>"
