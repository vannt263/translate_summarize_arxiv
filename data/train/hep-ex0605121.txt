    "flavor suppression in the incident neutrino beam is one of the key elements for successful neutrino appearance experiments . in the case of beam - dump experiments using muon",
    "decays from stopped pions , the contribution to neutrino production from negative pions is expected to be significantly suppressed , because negative pions are believed to undergo nuclear capture promptly after stopping in material , while positive pions freely decay .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0/@xmath7 production cross sections for a proton beam in the 0.51 gev energy region is about 1/5 for light nuclei , which further enhances this asymmetry .",
    "the total neutrino content after the pion decay @xmath8 followed by the muon decay @xmath9 ( @xmath10 decay ) does not include @xmath1 s in the final state .",
    "the contribution from decay - in - flight is a few per cent for a pion .",
    "this provides a good opportunity for @xmath1 appearance experiments.@xcite however , a finite @xmath0 lifetime in the stopping material may result in additional @xmath1 contamination .    normally , after stopping and being trapped in an atomic orbit , a negative pion orbiting the nucleus promptly de - excites by the auger process , radiative cascade decays , or stark mixing to an s state , where the significant overlap of the wave function with the nucleus enables the @xmath0 to be captured by the nucleus .",
    "if the @xmath0 is not captured by the nucleus it may decay freely in the atomic state .",
    "the free decay fraction of @xmath0 s was measured to be @xmath11 @xcite in hydrogen and is expected to decrease with the atomic number .",
    "however , there is an exception in the @xmath0he atom system@xcite , where the @xmath0 is trapped in a meta - stable state that has little wave - function overlap with the nucleus and the auger processes are suppressed@xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to confirm the absence of other mechanisms that may cause free decays of @xmath0 s .",
    "limits for the fraction of the free - decay component exist for h@xmath12 and he@xcite ( data in ne is only applicable to a meta - stable state with a lifetime longer than @xmath13 ns ) .",
    "this paper reports the results of a search for a free decay component of @xmath0 in water and light materials from analyses of electron yields and proton spectra .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the time diagrams involved in pionic atom formation ( left ) up to the disappearance of the pion by ( a ) prompt nuclear capture , ( b and b ) free decay with a partial lifetime @xmath14 , and ( c ) delayed pion capture with a partial lifetime of @xmath15 .",
    "the processes ( a ) and ( c ) feed into `` @xmath0 atom '' ( right ) . since the diagrams for delayed pionic atom formation ( left ) and delayed nuclear capture ( right ) are identical , and since the two processes can not be discriminated or separated in this analysis , the two processes are considered as a single process with prompt capture notation , @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath15 are used in this analysis . the common observed lifetime , @xmath18 , in the diagrams already assumes only delayed capture process .",
    "a direct method to search for free @xmath0 decay is to detect decay products of pions ( b ) .",
    "detection of muons from the decay @xmath19 in water is not practical because of the short muon range in water ( @xmath20  mm ) .",
    "however , electrons from the @xmath21 decay chain ( @xmath22  mev ) can be detected . in this method",
    ", the background from decay - in - flight ( dif ) of a pion to a muon , which stops in materials around the target and later decays to an electron , must be subtracted using monte carlo ( mc ) calculations .",
    "the advantages of the search for electrons from the decay @xmath21 are that the measurement is the sum of all free decay components with different lifetimes and that the sensitivity does not strongly depend on the lifetime @xmath23 ; it varies only by @xmath2410 % for the lifetime between 0 ns and the pion lifetime @xmath25",
    "ns@xcite .",
    "alternately , free @xmath0 decay may be detected by the presence of electrons from the decay @xmath26 . however , because of its small branching ratio , @xmath27 @xcite , it is very difficult to differentiate it from the background arising from prompt nuclear capture @xmath28-rays that convert in the target to an electron - positron pair .",
    "the search for @xmath29 is effective for a component with a relatively long lifetime .",
    "the third method ( indirect ) is to search for delayed components ( c ) in the time spectrum of pion capture products , such as protons , @xmath28-rays , and @xmath30 s .",
    "the ratio of delayed @xmath0 capture @xmath31 is expressed as    @xmath32    by eliminating @xmath17 and @xmath15 , which are not directly observable , the free decay fraction ( b ) can be deduced ,    @xmath33    it should be noted that when @xmath23 approaches @xmath14 the equation approaches to unity , indicating that the capture experiment is insensitive to the free decay component as @xmath15 approaches infinity . in order to be sensitive to a fast decay component in the presence of the dominant prompt capture ( the process ( a ) ) , the experiment is required to have good time resolution . in the search for delayed components in water , this can be achieved by measuring protons that have high energy losses , therefore , with small time walk and spread .",
    "proton measurements are not sensitive to @xmath0 capture by hydrogen in water , since only @xmath28-rays , @xmath30 s , and neutrons are produced . the majority ( @xmath34 % ) of @xmath0 s in water@xcite are captured by oxygen atoms .",
    "the experiment was performed at the triumf m9a channel . typical ratios of incoming beam particles at the experimental target were e:@xmath35:@xmath36=5:1:4 for a positive - particle beam and e:@xmath35:@xmath36=88:3:9 for a negative - particle beam at @xmath37  mev / c with a momentum bite @xmath38  % .",
    "figure 2 shows the detector set - up . the position and the direction of incoming beam particles",
    "were measured by two sets of x - y read - out wire chambers ( wc1 and wc2 ) located 95 cm and 50 cm upstream of the target . two plastic scintillators b1 ( 76-mm high , 76-mm wide ,",
    "3.2-mm thick ) and b2 ( 35-mm high , 25-mm wide , 5-mm thick ) were placed 8 cm and 3 cm upstream of the target center , respectively . in order to collimate the beam ( to detect scattered beam by @xmath39 the wc frames ) , a @xmath40mm@xmath41 plastic counter with a 76-mm diameter hole ( not shown in the figure )",
    "was placed 5 cm upstream of the b1 counter .",
    "purified water for the target was held in a @xmath42 mm@xmath43 container made of 0.2-mm thick aluminum frame and 50-@xmath35 m thick beam windows ( both ends ) .",
    "the target was tilted to 45 degrees with respect to the beam ( some runs were taken at 45 degrees ) .",
    "a @xmath44152-mm@xmath41 veto counter b3 for the detection of passing - through beam particles was placed 40 cm downstream of the target .",
    "more than 90 % of pions stopped in the target at a rate of 110 khz for the @xmath0 beam and 30100 khz for @xmath7 .",
    "the decay products were observed by two telescope arms at 5 cm from the beam axis at @xmath45 degrees .",
    "each telescope consisted of three 36 mm thick plastic scintillators ( t1t3 or m1m3 ) , and a 46-cm diameter , 51-cm long nai(tl ) crystal ( tina ) or a 36-cm diameter , 36-cm long nai(tl ) ( mina ) . in each telescope ,",
    "the farthest scintillator from the target was the largest one that covered the front face of the nai for pile - up detection .",
    "the solid angle of each telescope was defined by the 102 @xmath46 102-mm@xmath41 t1 or the 76 @xmath46 76-mm@xmath41 m1 counter . for @xmath30 detection ,",
    "a 5-mm thick @xmath47-mm@xmath41 lead sheet was placed as a converter between the first and the second plastic scintillators in the mina telescope .",
    "the trigger required a pion stopping in the target ( b1@xmath48b2@xmath49 ) with the presence of an outgoing particle into the t2 or m2 counter in the time window from 50 ns to 150 ns with respect to the prompt time  this condition allowed to accept events containing electrons , @xmath28-rays , @xmath30 s ( two @xmath28-rays ) , protons , and deuterons .",
    "typical trigger rates were 70 hz for @xmath0 runs and 150 hz for @xmath7 with a deadtime of 1030 % .",
    "the timing and pulse heights of all the scintillation counters , two coordinates from each wire chamber , and the relative phase of the 23.06-mhz cyclotron rf ( incident proton beam bunches ) to the b2 counter time for the time - of - flight ( tof ) measurement of a beam particle were recorded . in order to record pile - up information , additional wide - gate ( 250 ns ) adc s",
    "were employed using signals split from b1 , b3 , t3 , and m3 counters for detection of extra charge outside the standard gate ( 50 ns ) .",
    "pile - up in the nai counters was measured by using two additional adc s with an early gate that closed just before the main pulse , and a late gate ( by 200 ns ) to compare to the normal gate adc .",
    "special runs were taken for calibration and normalization ; runs with a trigger using a pulser driven by a pre - scaled cyclotron rf signal , runs requiring only the presence of incoming particles ( b1@xmath48b2 ) , and runs with positive beam particles ( for normalization of the electron acceptance ) . for @xmath50 measurement , a 30-mm diameter , 12-mm thick cylindrical water target was used without tilting , together with a 25-mm diameter , 5-mm thick b2 counter that faced the target with a variable gap between @xmath51  cm .",
    "also , other candidate materials for the beam moderators at a neutrino factory , beryllium ( @xmath52 mm@xmath43 ) and aluminum ( @xmath53 mm@xmath43 ) , were used as targets during several runs . a vinegar target ( 5 % acetic acid by volume )",
    "was used to simulate possible effects of excessive h@xmath54 ions in water generated by the high - intensity proton beam of the stopped - beam facility .",
    "measurement was made at beam momenta of 64 , 67 , 70 , 73 , 76 and 80 mev / c to confirm the stopping position of pions and to test systematic effects . +",
    "beam pions were identified by the energy loss in the first beam counter b1 , and the tof with respect to the proton beam bunch .",
    "figure 3 shows a scatter plot of b1 counter energy vs rf time with respect to the b2 time after the time walk correction . at the experimental target position ( about 10 m from the pion production target ) , the tof of electrons coming from the next beam bucket was separated from that of 70-mev / c pions , and the probability of misidentifying a beam electron as a pion was estimated to be @xmath55 .",
    "the tof peak of muons was clearly separated .",
    "the beam counters were calibrated using estimated energy losses of @xmath56 s , @xmath35 s and @xmath36 s that passed through the counters .",
    "the telescope counters were calibrated with positrons from @xmath57 decays , @xmath58 decays and scattered beam particles . for tina and mina , energy losses in the telescope counters and",
    "the 1-mev shift due to positron annihilation were taken into account .",
    "time calibration was based on the repeated peaks with the rf cycle in the time spectra .",
    "figure 4 shows a scatter plot of energy in the t2 counter vs energy in tina , in which the diagonal band is from protons produced by pion capture , the flat distribution around the energy loss of 2 mev / cm is from electrons ( up to 45 mev from @xmath59 decays and around 60 mev from scattered beam electrons ) , and the distribution around 100 mev with twice the energy loss of electrons in the t2 counter is from electron - positron pairs from @xmath28-rays converted in the t1 counter or the target .      in the analysis of @xmath21 decay events ,",
    "data taken with the circular water target were used .",

    "no proton contamination below @xmath60=80 mev was observed .",
    "some events from two `` electrons '' were accepted with the @xmath61 cut in the t - counters , but they appeared together with scattered beam electrons at the prompt time and at every 43 ns with respect to the prompt time . only delayed events outside those affected regions ( @xmath62 = 4881 ns with respect to the prompt time @xmath63)@xcite were selected for the analysis .    the histogram of figure 5 shows the energy spectrum measured in the b2 counter for the events that passed the above cuts .",
    "the position of the b2 counter was in contact with the target ( @xmath64=0 cm ) .",
    "dif contributions before and after passing the b2 counter are the major remaining components .",
    "events from decays after passing the b2 counter form a peak around 5 mev that corresponds to energy loss of pions passing through the b2 counter prior to stopping in the target .",
    "events from the decays before passing the b2 counter form a broad distribution with a shoulder around 3.5 mev that corresponds to the energy loss of the highest energy muons ( @xmath2432 mev for forward pion decays ) and the lower energy events are from the backward - decay muons that stopped in the b2 counter .",
    "the contribution of dif events was simulated by mc based on geant3 @xcite with a modification for the @xmath0 treatment .",
    "pions were generated at the exit of the beam pipe ( 110 cm upstream of the target ) with a profile of @xmath65 cm@xmath41 projecting to the target ( @xmath67 cm@xmath41 ) according to a flat momentum distribution centered at 70 ( @xmath68 4 % ) mev / c that reproduced the measured energy spectrum of pions taken with a beam trigger .",
    "when a @xmath0 stopped in material , it was promptly captured ( capture products were not generated in the @xmath50 simulation ) .",
    "muon capture was not included in the mc , but the effect was included in the lifetime correction by using the free muon lifetime instead of the lifetime of the muonic atom @xcite .",
    "the effect of the binding energy ( 0.2 mev for the muonic oxygen atom ) on the electron spectrum was ignored .",
    "the mc events were analyzed with the same selection criteria as the experimental data and the energy spectrum in the b2 counter was obtained as shown by the dotted line in fig . 5 ( normalized to the total count ) .",
    "the shape of the distribution is well reproduced by mc calculations of the dif events described above .",
    "the ratio of the two components in the mc spectrum , the peak ( dif after b2 ) and the broad bump ( dif before b2 ) , strongly depended on the gap @xmath64 , especially near the target ( @xmath64=0 cm ) . although the peak is , in principle , more sensitive to the free decay component , the sum was used in the analysis because of this strong dependence near @xmath64=0 cm for reliable subtraction of the background estimated by the mc calculations .",
    "the contamination from the @xmath35 s in the beam was negligible .    in order to obtain the free decay component fraction , the yield was normalized to that of the @xmath10 decays in the same time window with the corrections for the lifetime and the stopping fractions obtained from the beam - trigger data ( @xmath69 ) @xcite .",
