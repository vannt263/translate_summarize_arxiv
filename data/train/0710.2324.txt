    "several exotic qcd states , such as glueballs , hybrids or multiquarks , are expected to have masses between 1 and 2.5 gev/@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "radiative @xmath15 and @xmath1 decays are traditionally regarded as gluon - rich environments ; such decays , although well investigated , are still promising for the discovery and identification of qcd exotica .",
    "for example , in radiative decays into pseudoscalars , two of the most promising glueball candidates , the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 , are seen @xcite .",
    "several high precision partial wave analyses of radiative @xmath15 decays have been performed @xcite , and a recent bes - paper presented an analysis of a high statistics sample of @xmath1 decays , without a partial wave analysis @xcite .",
    "this paper updates the @xmath1 radiative decays @xcite with @xmath2 and @xmath3 final states , giving access to scalar and tensor intermediate states .    within the quark model @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 is believed to have 2 @xmath16 as its main component , and the @xmath15 is the 1 @xmath16 @xmath17-state .",
    "this gives a @xmath1 with a behavior that differs from @xmath15 only due to the difference in energy scale and in the radial wave function .",
    "the so - called 12%-rule from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) relates the branching fractions of the two states into a particular hadronic final state ( @xmath18 ) :    @xmath19    where the branching fractions are from ref .",
    "a radiative decay mode would be similar , but would proceed via one photon and two gluons , exchanging one power of @xmath20 with @xmath21 in the coupling @xcite .",
    "a large violation of the 12%-rule was first observed in 1983 in @xmath1 decays to @xmath22 and @xmath23 by markii ; it became known as the @xmath22-puzzle @xcite .",
    "since then , many two - body decay modes have been compared , of which some obey and some violate the rule @xcite .",
    "the analysis uses the besii data sample of @xmath24 @xmath1-events @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath25 pb@xmath26 @xcite , and a set of continuum data at @xmath27 gev , ( @xmath28 ) pb@xmath26 @xcite , also measured with the besii detector .",

    "particle identification by energy loss techniques is complemented by a measurement of the time - of - flight ( tof ) from the interaction point to 48 scintillation counters surrounding the mdc ( time resolution @xmath32200 ps for hadrons ) . outside",
    "the tof - scintillators is a 12 radiation length lead - gas barrel shower counter ( bsc ) , which measures the energy of electrons and photons over @xmath3280% of the total solid angle with a resolution of @xmath33}$ ] .",
    "in addition , the iron flux return , outside the solenoid coil ( 0.4 t axial field ) , is instrumented with three double layers of counters for identification of muons with momenta larger than 0.5 gev/@xmath34 .",
    "the cylindrical structure is closed by end - caps .",
    "events with at least one photon and two oppositely charged tracks with good helix fits and complete covariance matrices are selected .",
    "end - cap information is used to reject background with extra charged particles in the end - cap region , but only events within the well - understood barrel detectors are included in the analysis .",
    "the polar angles of the charged particles are required to fulfill @xmath35 for @xmath12 and @xmath36 for @xmath8 , where @xmath37 is the angle of the charged particle with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the vertex of the two charged tracks is required to satisfy @xmath38 cm and @xmath39 cm , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 coordinates of the point of closest approach of each charged track to the beam axis .",
    "the photon with the highest energy is tested for quality : it must be within the barrel detector , it must have its first hit in the bsc inside the first 12 layers out of 24 , it must be separated from charged tracks by at least 15@xmath46 in the xy - plane at the entrance of the bsc , and the photon direction from the origin to the bsc must agree within 35@xmath46 with the shower direction in the bsc .",
    "the most abundant @xmath47 reactions at gev - energies are qed processes , mainly @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in cases",
    "where there is initial or final state radiation , the event could be misidentified as @xmath3 or @xmath2 .",
    "muons are rejected using muon chamber information ; this is especially important in the @xmath3-channel , therefore the stricter angular cut .",
    "bhabha events , @xmath50 , are rejected using the @xmath29 @xmath51-value under the @xmath52 hypothesis ( @xmath53 ) combined with the energy deposited in the calorimeter @xmath54 and the momentum @xmath55 . to reject background from @xmath56 , the selected sample is required to satisfy @xmath57    the tof and @xmath29 measurements of the two charged tracks and a kinematic fit with four degrees of freedom",

    "a confidence level of better than 1% is required for each event sample , and for ambiguous cases , the most likely assignment is chosen .",
    "after all requirements , the overall detection and event selection efficiency is @xmath3215% ( see table  [ tab : pinumevents ] and  [ tab : knumevents ] for exact numbers ) .",
    "the probability that a @xmath2 event is selected as a @xmath59 event is 0.17% , and the probability that a @xmath59 event is selected as a @xmath2 event is 0.14% , from monte carlo simulation .      a carefully checked geant3-based monte carlo program @xcite is used to determine invariant mass resolution ( @xmath6010 mev/@xmath14 for @xmath61 and for @xmath62 ) , angular efficiency , absolute efficiency , and background suppression . using this program ,",
    "the contributions from qed - processes after event selection are found to be small ( dominated by 15@xmath632 @xmath64 events in @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , both qed backgrounds and non - resonant hadronic signals are estimated using the continuum data sample , where the main contributor to the non - resonant background is found to be initial - state - radiation and subsequent @xmath65 or @xmath66-formation .",

    "the fit to the two - pion invariant mass spectrum between 1 and 3 gev/@xmath14 allows the determination of the number of events and the product decay branching fractions of @xmath94 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or a high mass component modeled here with @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( table [ tab : pinumevents ] ) .",
