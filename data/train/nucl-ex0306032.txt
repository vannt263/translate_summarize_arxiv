    "odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei are special many - body systems which are very suitable for the test of isospin symmetry @xcite .",
    "the reason is that they are most symmetric with respect to the proton - neutron degree of freedom and that yrast states with different isospin quantum numbers coexist at low energy @xcite .",
    "this allows @xmath2-ray spectroscopy of isovector @xmath12 transitions and it makes odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei important for testing isospin symmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these nuclei play a decisive role in the determination of the @xmath13 part of effective interactions , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , and they are of great interest for the understanding of weak processes , enhancement mechanisms of electromagnetic transitions , as well as for problems of nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "however , up to very recent time more or less comprehensive information was available only for the odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 shells and for one nucleus from the @xmath9-shell : @xmath16sc .",
    "recent progress in both experimental and theoretical directions brought new valuable data for the heavy odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei @xmath17v @xcite , @xmath18mn @xcite , and @xmath19co @xcite in the lower part of the @xmath9-shell ( @xmath20-shell ) and even for some nuclei of the upper part of the @xmath9-shell , like @xmath21br @xcite . while some understanding of the key problems of the low - energy structure of @xmath20 nuclei seems to be obtained and regularities similar to the ones appropriate for the @xmath22-shell are revealed there are still many uncertainties for low - spin structure of these nuclei with mass numbers @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the first odd - odd @xmath0 nucleus of this region , which may help to draw confident conclusions on the situation in the mass region above @xmath11ni is @xmath1cu .",
    "but the experimental data available for the low - energy level scheme of @xmath1cu @xcite is quite sparse and the theoretical full-@xmath9 shell model treatment of this nucleus is a tough computational problem .",
    "early attempts to understand the low - spin level scheme of @xmath1cu were , therefore , limited to shell model calculations with the inert @xmath11ni core .",
    "this approach unsatisfactorily required substantial changes in the values of single particle energies with respect to the ones for the @xmath20 nuclei and too large effective quadrupole charges @xcite .",
    "this paper presents new experimental data for @xmath1cu which was investigated with the @xmath1ni(p , n@xmath2)@xmath1cu fusion evaporation reaction up to an excitation energy of 3.5  mev with the cologne osiris cube @xmath2-array .",
    "we could significantly extend the hitherto known low spin level scheme of @xmath1cu @xcite , identify many new transitions , and establish their multipole character and relative intensities .",
    "the new experimental results are accompanied by full @xmath9-shell model calculations with the new gxpf1 residual interaction @xcite universal for the whole @xmath9-shell and help to verify experimental assignments .",
    "the data and the gxpf1 results are compared to schematic shell model calculations with the @xmath11ni core and a residual surface delta interaction ( sdi ) .",
    "the consequences of the softness of the @xmath11ni core on the spectra are pointed out .",
    "excited states of @xmath1cu were populated in the @xmath1ni(p , n@xmath2)@xmath1cu fusion evaporation reaction with a beam energy of 14 mev provided by the cologne fn - tandem accelerator .",
    "the target was a 1 mg/@xmath24 thick highly enriched self - supporting @xmath1ni foil .",
    "five compton - suppressed ge - detectors and one compton - suppressed euroball cluster detectors @xcite were used in the cologne osiris cube - spectrometer .",
    "two of the ge - detectors were mounted in forward direction at an angle @xmath25 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "another two were mounted in the backward direction at an angle of @xmath26 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the fifth ge - detector and the euroball cluster detector were placed at an angle @xmath27 below and above the beam line , respectively . about @xmath28 @xmath3-coincidence events",

    "it is displayed in fig .",
    "we observed 17 levels and 31 @xmath2 transitions in this nucleus .",
    "with respect to earlier spectroscopic work @xcite , 17 @xmath2 transitions and five levels are new . in order to assign spin and parity quantum numbers we analyzed the @xmath3 angular correlation information and the signs of linear polarizations using the euroball cluster detector as a compton polarimeter .",
    "the angular correlation pattern is determined by the spin quantum numbers of the levels involved in a cascade , by the gaussian width @xmath31 of the @xmath32-substate distribution of the initial level and by the multipole character of the corresponding @xmath2 radiation .",
    "the gaussian width @xmath31 @xcite and multipole mixing ratio @xmath33 have been deduced from @xmath34 minimization @xcite .",
    "the sign convention following krane , steffen and wheeler @xcite has been used for the determination of @xmath33 .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath3 angular correlations resulted in five new unambiguous spin assignments for the levels at 444 kev ( @xmath29 ) , 1052 kev ( @xmath35 ) , 2066 kev ( @xmath36 ) , 2751 kev ( @xmath37 ) and 3423 kev ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the spin assignments for the levels at 2066 kev ( @xmath36 ) and 3423 kev ( @xmath38 ) are based on the spin and parity assignment @xmath39 of the level at 444 kev .",
    "the assignment for the level at 1653 kev ( @xmath40 ) has been confirmed in the present experiment .",

    "the 1103  1648 kev cascade connects the level at 1648  kev , which could be assigned @xmath29 via the angular correlation of the 1204  444 kev cascade , with the @xmath41 ground state .",
    "it is evident from the figure , that a spin quantum number @xmath42 for the level at 2751  kev can not reproduce the data ( @xmath43 ) for any value of the possible octupole / quadrupole mixing ratio @xmath33 of the assumed @xmath44 transition .",
    "in contrast to this the fitted values are in good accordance with the experimental ones ( @xmath45 ) for a spin quantum number @xmath37 for the level at 2751  kev . for the correlation analysis",
    "we treat the parameter , @xmath31 , which describes the gaussian width of the @xmath32-substate distribution , as a free parameter . aside from the spin quantum numbers of the excited states , the measured @xmath3 angular correlations also give valuable information on the multipole mixing ratios of the @xmath2 transitions involved ( see table [ table1 ] ) .    for seven levels with known spin values",
    ", we could also deduce the parity .",
    "this assignment was based on the electric or magnetic character of the depopulating @xmath2-transitions . to determine this character ,",
    "the cluster detector was used as a compton polarimeter .",
    "the sum of two coincident detector signals , which stem from the compton scattering of an initial @xmath2-quantum in one segment of the cluster and the subsequent absorption in another segment , carries the full energy information of the initial @xmath2-ray .",
    "the geometry of the compton scattering process depends on the polarization of the initial @xmath2-ray with respect to the beam axis .",
    "therefore observable asymmetries of the compton scattering process allow to measure the @xmath2-polarizations and the radiation character .",
    "the seven large volume ge - crystals of the cluster form a non - orthogonal polarimeter . numerical simulations @xcite as well as recent experiments",
    "@xcite have shown , that the cluster detector is an efficient compton polarimeter .",
    "the in - set in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the configuration of the cluster with respect to the beam axis in the present experiment .",
    "this configuration leads to three different scattering planes for the compton scattering of @xmath2-rays between adjacent segments of the cluster . in our experiment",
    "these scattering planes enclosed angles of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 with the reaction plane , respectively .",
    "the sum energy of the two coincident signals was sorted in two different spectra , @xmath49 and @xmath50 depending on to which scattering plane the involved pair of segments corresponds .",
    "these spectra were used to obtain proper spectra for compton scattering intensity differences and sums , namely , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the experimental asymmetry is defined as @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the positively defined polarization sensitivity of the cluster and @xmath55 is the linear polarization of the incoming photon with respect to the given geometry . since the sign of the linear polarization , @xmath56 , determines the character of the electromagnetic radiation in case of pure multipolarity , we can conclude this character with eq .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the difference spectrum @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 has positive values for all energies .",
    "a summary of the energy levels with certain spin and parity values and with their depopulating @xmath2 transitions and branching ratios is given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the assignment of the isospin quantum number @xmath60 is done by comparing the energies of the levels to the energies of the corresponding states of the @xmath60 isobaric partner nucleus @xmath1ni .    from isospin symmetry",
    "we expect , that the excitation energies of analogue states are close in isobaric partners .",
    "the two lowest excited states in @xmath1ni are the @xmath61 state at 1454  kev and the @xmath62 state at 2460 kev . from the excitation energy of the @xmath63 state in @xmath1ni and from the difference of excitation energies ( 1450  kev ) of the @xmath64 state ( 203  kev ) and the @xmath4 state ( 1653  kev ) in @xmath1cu",
    "one can assign the isospin quantum number @xmath60 to the @xmath4 state in @xmath1cu .",
    "furthermore the large @xmath65 matrix elements of the 601.4  kev and 1208.8 kev transitions to the @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath13 states , respectively , and the predominantly isovector character of the @xmath65 transition operator support the @xmath60 assignment .    assuming positive parity for the @xmath37 state of @xmath1cu at 2751  kev excitation energy , it can be tentatively identified as the ias of the @xmath62 , @xmath60 state of @xmath1ni . similar to the case of the @xmath4 state , this assignment is again based on the comparison of the excitation energy difference ( 2548  kev ) to the @xmath64 state at 203  kev with the excitation energy of the @xmath62 state of @xmath1ni and on the @xmath2-decay pattern .",
    "the decays of that @xmath68 state to the @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath13 states is characterized by very small quadrupole / dipole mixing ratios .",
    "this fact supports the @xmath60 assignment for the level at 2751  kev .",
    "although small quadrupole / dipole mixing ratios were also expected for a @xmath60 state with negative parity we can discard the possibility of a @xmath60 @xmath71 state because there are no negative parity states in @xmath1ni in this energy region . in a previous study of @xmath1cu @xcite a level at 2690(20 ) kev was identified as the @xmath60 , @xmath72 state from particle spectroscopy in ( @xmath73he,@xmath74 ) charge exchange reactions .",
    "its @xmath60 assignment was done in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the close energy match to the @xmath75 state of the isobaric partner nucleus @xmath1ni .",
    "this state was not observed in the present experiment and its decay properties are not known . due to the comparably large uncertainty for the excitation energies deduced from that particle",
    "spectroscopy the values of energies from the previous and the present paper for the assigned @xmath7 states at about 2.7 mev agree within three standard deviations .",
    "therefore , one might think that the uncertainty in excitation energy of 2690(20 ) kev claimed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite could have been too optimistic for that particular level and their @xmath60 , @xmath72 state would coincide with the @xmath60 , @xmath72 state at 2751 kev proposed above .",
    "it is , however , also possible that there exists a doublet of @xmath7 states , one with isospin quantum number @xmath60 and the other with @xmath13 as it was recently observed in the neighboring odd - odd @xmath0 nucleus @xmath19co @xcite .",
    "the latter hypothesis is supported by the shell model results discussed in the next section .",
    "one of the first successful and very important results of the nuclear shell model was an understanding of the origin of the @xmath76 magic number .",
    "thus , the nucleus @xmath11ni has the properties of a doubly magic inert core in a simple approach of spherical shell model .",
    "this assumes that the low - energy structure of @xmath77 nuclei with several nucleons above @xmath11ni may be described within the shell model in small configurational spaces .",
    "@xmath1cu is one of such nuclei and shell model calculations with a @xmath11ni core have been performed for this nucleus already in the late 1960 s @xcite .",
    "however , it was realized that the excitations of @xmath11ni core are important for the structure of the nuclei with @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the recent information on @xmath11ni @xcite establishes a rather high degree of softness of @xmath11ni .",
    "core excitations are important and can be described by modern large - valence shell calculations .",
    "in fact , it has been found that a recent effective interaction suitable for mid-@xmath9-shell nuclei produces a significant amount of @xmath11ni core excitations in neighbor nuclei of about 30 - 40% @xcite .",
    "one way to identify the impact of the core excitations on the structure of @xmath1cu is to compare the predictions of modern large - scale shell model calculations with an effective interaction adjusted for the full pf - shell  which include the core excitations  with small space shell model calculations with an inert @xmath11ni core and a schematic interaction suitable for the smaller @xmath10 space  that do not contain the core excitations .",
    "we have , therefore , performed two sets of shell model calculations for @xmath1cu .",
    "the first one uses @xmath11ni as the core and a residual surface delta interaction ( sdi ) @xcite with a parameterization similar to the one for @xmath19co @xcite .",
    "single particle energies were extracted further from the spectrum of @xmath78ni ( see table  [ param ] ) .",
    "the resulted excitation energies are compared to the experimental spectra in fig .",
    "[ sdispectra ] .",
    "we note that there is a good agreement for the two lowest states of each spin value @xmath79 , except for the @xmath67 and the @xmath80 state for which the calculated energies are 0.5 mev higher than the experimental ones .",
    "we have calculated also @xmath81 and @xmath82 values between the low - lying states which are shown in table  [ 4 ] .",
    "the second set of calculations was performed by the tokyo group with the new effective gxpf1 interaction @xcite .",
    "this interaction ( 195 two - body matrix elements and 4 single particle energies ) was determined partly from a fit to 699 experimental binding energies and level energies from 87 nuclei with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the starting point for the fitting procedure was a realistic g - matrix interaction with core - polarization corrections based on the bonn - c potential .",
    "thus , for the first time a universal effective interaction for the whole @xmath9-shell is determined .",
    "the calculation with the gxpf1 interaction was performed in the full @xmath9 shell with up to 6-particle excitations from the @xmath20 orbital to the @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 orbitals .",
    "results for the excitation energies are compared to the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ gxpf1spectra ] .",
    "one may note quite good reproduction of the experimental data .",
    "in contrast to the calculations with the inert @xmath11ni core ( see fig .  [ sdispectra ] ) there are also states with @xmath88 which are entirely due to the breaking of the @xmath11ni core .",
    "they are coming mainly from a coupling of the one - neutron - one - proton states to the first excited @xmath89 state at 2.7 mev in the @xmath11ni core .",
    "the energies of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 states are perfectly reproduced indicating that the core excitations are correctly taken into account .",
    "furthermore there is a much better agreement for the @xmath92 and the @xmath93 states .",
    "it has to be emphasized also a very good reproduction of the excitation energies and an ordering of the @xmath94 and the @xmath95 states which form isospin doublet .",
    "the electromagnetic transition strengths and lifetimes calculated with gxpf1 are compared also to the available experimental data in table  [ 4 ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare the two sets of calculations .",
    "the excitation energies of the yrast low - lying states with @xmath96 are reproduced excellently by the gxpf1 and acceptable for the sdi interaction .",
    "the mean level deviations are 41 kev and 83 kev , respectively . furthermore the single particle energies ( s.p.e . )",
    "used for the sdi with the @xmath11ni core and the effective s.p.e .",
    "from gxpf1 for the @xmath11ni core are rather similar .",
    "however , switching to electromagnetic transition strengths we find many differences ( see columns th-1 and th-2a , th-2b of table [ 4 ] ) .    first , we note that to reproduce the experimental @xmath97 value in the calculations with the @xmath11ni core we have to increase the sum of the effective quadrupole charges @xmath98 by a factor of 2 as compared to the gxpf1 charges .",
    "this causes also other @xmath99 @xmath100 transitions to become enhanced some of them even exceeding the corresponding large @xmath82 values from the gxpf1 calculations , _",
    "e.g. _ like the @xmath100 decays of the @xmath66 state .",
    "second , favored isovector @xmath101 @xmath65 transitions are of special interest , while isoscalar @xmath65 s are strongly suppressed and usually carry less information on the structure of the wave functions . in the simple quasideuteron picture @xcite one expects a strong enhancement of @xmath102 transitions ( up to 7.3 @xmath103 with spin - quenching of 0.7 ) for @xmath1cu because of the firm presence of the @xmath85 orbital",
    ". indeed , in the calculations with the @xmath11ni - core , which closer matches the quasi - deuteron scheme , the summed @xmath81 strength for the lowest two @xmath104 states amounts to 5.7 @xmath103 .",
    "the inclusion of core excitations reduces this sum to 2.5 @xmath103 .",
    "the distribution of this @xmath65 strength among these two lowest @xmath104 states is different for the two sets of calculations , too .",
    "the @xmath105 values are rather similar in both calculations , but the @xmath106 values differ by a factor of 5 even for the quenching of 0.7 for the sdi .",
    "since the calculations with the ni core are in a very small configurational space one expects larger @xmath81 values as compared to the large scale shell model .",
    "this is correct for the @xmath107 value but not for the @xmath108 value .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of the @xmath100 strengths for the @xmath109 and @xmath110 transitions yields an apparent inversion of the @xmath111 and @xmath66 states in the sdi calculation with respect to the gxpf1 results .",
    "the latter yields almost the same @xmath82 ratio for these two transitions as the experimental one .",
    "the @xmath112 values allow to draw the same conclusion .",
    "this inversion of the @xmath104 states and the considerable reduction of the @xmath65 strengths are caused by the core excitations .",
    "most interesting are , however , the isovector @xmath65 strengths for the @xmath113 and @xmath114 transitions .",
    "their ratio also indicates the inversion of the @xmath13 @xmath104 states : for the gxpf1 calculations the stronger transition goes to the @xmath66 state , while for the sdi interaction it is the transition to the @xmath111 state .",
    "the latter should be almost completely forbidden according to the gxpf1 result .",
    "the @xmath65 strengths for the isovector @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 transitions indicate that many @xmath81 values even from the gxpf1 calculations are significantly stronger than the isovector @xmath119 or @xmath113 transitions by two to four orders of magnitude .",
    "a suppression of an isovector @xmath65 transition by four orders of magnitude could indicate the presence of a powerful selection rule being at work .",
    "we propose that this hindrance of the @xmath113 transition is a consequence of a @xmath120-phonon @xcite selection rule applied here to @xmath65 transitions in the shell model .",
    "the reasoning if this interpretation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : qphon ] . in the shell model calculation with the gxpf1 interaction the @xmath60 @xmath4 state is most dominantly a complex one - quadrupole phonon excitation of the @xmath60 @xmath121 state , _",
    "i.e. _ , to a good approximation @xmath122 where @xmath120 denotes the isoscalar quadrupole operator",
    ". the @xmath13 @xmath111 state s wave function is instead generated to a large extent from the action of a part @xmath123 of the isovector @xmath65 transition operator on the @xmath60 @xmath121 state , @xmath124 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath125 transition represents a two - step process .",
    "the one - body @xmath65 transition operator can not simultaneously annihilate the @xmath126 @xmath120-phonon and cause the @xmath127 @xmath65 transition .",
    "therefore , the @xmath113 @xmath65 transition is strongly hindered which is well confirmed by the data .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the strong @xmath128 , @xmath129 @xmath65 transition , which is allowed in the @xmath120-phonon scheme if we consider the @xmath67 state as a @xmath120-phonon excitation of the @xmath111 state . for this @xmath128 transition",
    "one @xmath120-phonon excitation is present in both , the initial and the final state , and acts as a spectator .",
    "indeed , the @xmath81 values for the @xmath128 and @xmath127 transitions calculated with the gxpf1 interaction are close .",
    "it is of interest to analyze these observations from the viewpoint of symmetries discussed in @xcite .",
    "in summary we have investigated the low spin states of the odd - odd @xmath0 nucleus @xmath1cu with the @xmath1ni(p , n@xmath2)@xmath1cu fusion evaporation reaction . in the present experiment 17 low spin states were observed .",
    "five of them and 17 new @xmath2-ray transitions were observed for the first time .",
    "numerous multipole mixing ratios and branching ratios were determined and 5 new spin assignments were made .",
    "the new data helps to understand the role of core excitations for the low - spin structure of @xmath1cu .",
    "we have performed shell model calculations for the low - lying states of @xmath1cu with the sdi residual interaction with a @xmath11ni core and with the new gxpf1 interaction which is universal for the whole pf - shell .",
    "comparison of the experimental excitation energies to the corresponding experimental quantities shows that both calculations yield good agreement for the yrast states with @xmath96 .",
    "however the results of the two calculations differ considerably for electromagnetic transition strengths and the agreement with experiment is much better for the full-@xmath9 shell calculations . in particular",
    ", we note that the @xmath82 values for isoscalar transitions are enhanced by a factor of 4 and the isovector @xmath81 values are reduced by factor 5 - 10 for the full calculation as compared to the @xmath10 space .",
    "big changes in the electromagnetic transition strengths indicate the important role of @xmath11ni excitations for the structure of the low - spin states of @xmath1cu .",
    "the apparent hindrance of the @xmath12 isovector @xmath125 @xmath65 transition is well reproduced by the gxpf1 interaction and can be interpreted as the manifestation of a @xmath120-phonon selection rule for @xmath65 transitions in the shell model .",
    "another interesting result is the suggested existence of a @xmath13 and @xmath60 doublet of @xmath7 states at @xmath1302.7 mev .",
    "the comparison of data with the calculations favor the @xmath7 state at 2.751 mev to have isospin @xmath60",
