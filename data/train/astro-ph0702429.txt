    "spectroscopic analyses of normal hydrogen - rich stars naturally derive abundance ratios to hydrogen , as this element ( either in atoms or forming h@xmath4 ) dominates the opacity at optical and longer wavelengths .",
    "an abundance determination is based upon a physical model of the outer layers of the star , from where the observed photons escape .",
    "usually , such model relies on the assumption of plane - parallel homogeneous layers in hydrostatic and thermodynamic balance .",
    "the complexities of a real star s envelope ( e.g. hydrodynamics , magnetic fields , and rotation ) are neglected , in order to make the problem tractable , and the model has only a few parameters such as the total energy flux and surface gravity , which can be determined from observations .",
    "a model is constructed assuming an initial set of chemical abundances .",
    "the negative temperature gradient in the stellar atmosphere creates absorption lines which strength is proportional to the absorber s density relative to hydrogen .",
    "the actual abundance determination is performed by calculating a spectrum based on the adopted model atmosphere , comparing it to the observed lines , and adjusting the abundance as needed . if necessary , the cycle is iterated by computing a new model , until convergence . besides the model , transition probabilities are the most critical ingredient , and despite the success of quantum mechanics , accurate calculations are still only possible for relatively simple atoms and molecules . for others , we rely on laboratory measurements .    systematic and random errors in the observations",
    "have steadily been reduced in parallel with progress in instrumentation .",
    "errors associated with the underlying approximations in the interpretation of spectra are a more hairy issue .",
    "grevesse & sauval ( 1999 ) examined the history of solar iron abundance determinations starting with the analysis by henry norris russell in 1929 .",
    "the most salient feature was a fast increase of about an order of magnitude between the results derived in the 60 s and those published in the 80 s , which was caused by erroneous transition probabilities . by looking at their plot",
    ", one would suggest that analyses may be converging at @xmath5 , where n represents number density.](fe ) @xmath6 , with @xmath7 dex .",
    "more recently , gustafsson ( 2004 ) has made a similar study for the case of oxygen .",
    "the situation with this element is somewhat different , and could be described as a steady decrease with significant scatter . unlike the iron case , oxygen is a simpler atom which is successfully modeled under ls coupling , and gustafsson attributes the scatter mainly to differences in the analysis : employed spectral lines , model atmospheres , and the calculation of theoretical spectra .",
    "most elements observed and studied in the solar photosphere have a similar abundances pattern as those found in a special type of meteorites : the ci ( type i , c1 , or ivuna - type ) carbonaceous chondrites ( see , e.g. , anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "this very rare class of meteorites , of which only five falls are known , appears to have preserved the original composition of the solar nebula , with the exception of the most volatile elements : h , c , n , o , and the noble gases .",
    "meteoritic abundances are usually given relative to silicon , and using this element to bridge with photospheric abundances , the agreement is better than 10% for 31 elements and better then 15% for 41 ( lodders 2003 ) . the number density ratio fe / si derived in recent analyses of the solar spectrum is 0.87 , while in ci meteorites is 0.863 ( asplund et al .",
    "2000b , asplund 2000 , lodders 2003 )  a stunning agreement .",
    "unfortunately , the carbon and oxygen cases have no _ solid _ reference , and we are left to figure out their abundances from solar observations alone",
    ". we will not discuss whether the larger scatter in the historical evolution of the solar oxygen abundance determinations is related to this fact , and we will focus on the technical aspects .",
    "the motivation for this review is , primarily , the recent jumps in the value of the solar carbon and oxygen abundances as estimated from photospheric oxygen lines in the solar spectrum .",
    "the recent series of studies on this subject was driven by the availability of three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations of solar surface convection ( for a review see asplund 2005 ) .",
    "as we shall see , however , the new models are only partly responsible for the proposed abundance change .",
    "we will discuss how confident we can be about the new values , and what pieces of the puzzle still do not fit , trying to put the finger in the wound in order to stimulate further work in areas where needed the most .",
    "the first section is devoted to the difficulties involved in an analysis of oxygen lines in the solar spectrum .",
    "section 3 repeats the same exercise for carbon .",
    "section 4 is an attempt to summarize the main uncertainties still present in current abundance determinations , and suggest directions for future research .",
    "section 5 looks at other objects in the solar neighborhood to see whether current values of the solar abundance make sense in a broader context .",
    "section 6 closes this piece with a discussion and a summary .",
    "despite an atomic system amenable to accurate quantum mechanical calculations , the analysis of oxygen in the solar spectrum involves extra difficulties compared to the case of iron .",
    "the solar spectrum offers only a handful of oxygen absorption lines , and they tend to form far from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions , which makes their calculation more difficult and more dependent on collisional interactions .",
    "notable exceptions are the forbidden transitions that connect the atom s lowest states .      of the six forbidden transitions that connect the lowest three states of oxygen , there are three that fall in the optical and ( albeit weak ) are measurable in the solar spectrum ( lambert 1978 ) .",
    "the @xmath8d to @xmath8s transition at 557.7 nm is badly blended with c@xmath9 lines .",
    "the other two lines ( @xmath10p j=2,1 to @xmath8d at 630.0 nm and 636.3 nm ) coincide in wavelength with a ni i and a couple of cn transitions , respectively , but the contribution of these blends , although uncertain , is less significant . after estimating the strength of the potential blending features , lambert ( 1978 ) used these weak lines to derive an oxygen abundance of @xmath5(o)@xmath11 .",
    "the recent turmoil started precisely with a reanalysis of the forbidden line at 630.0 nm . despite the transition probability of the ni",
    "i remained highly uncertain , allende prieto , lambert & asplund ( 2001 ) realized that its strength could be inferred , independently of the oxygen abundance , by taking advantage of the new generation of hydrodynamical models of the solar surface .",
    "solar photospheric absorption lines are asymmetric and blue - shifted from their rest wavelength by up to 500 m s@xmath12 as a result of convective motions in the solar envelope  what is observed in images of the solar surface as granulation .",
    "classical model atmospheres , built under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , predict perfectly symmetric line profiles .",
    "state - of - the - art hydrodynamical models , in turn , predict convective line asymmetries and shifts in good agreement with those observed , typically within @xmath13 m s@xmath12 ( allende prieto et al . 2002 ; asplund et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "the rest wavelengths of the oxygen and nickel transitions were already known with an accuracy of @xmath14 pm ( 1 pm @xmath15 m ) . by modeling the oxygen abundance , the strength of the ni i blending contribution ( @xmath16(ni ) ) , and a continuum normalization factor for the observed line profile , allende prieto et al . concluded that evidence pointed to a lower oxygen abundance than earlier estimates , @xmath5(o)@xmath17 dex .",
    "the revision was associated with a much larger contribution from the ni i line ( @xmath18 % , or an abundance change of 0.13 dex ) , and a different thermodynamical structure of the hydrodynamical simulations compared to the classical model atmospheres used previously ( 0.08 dex ) , both working in the same direction .",
    "more recently , johansson et al . (",
    "2003 ) performed laboratory measurements of the ni i transition overlapped with [ oi ] 630.0 nm , providing a transition probability as well as wavelengths for the components associated with the two most abundant isotopes , @xmath19ni and @xmath20ni , which together account for over 94 % of the nickel on earth .",
    "if the analysis of the solar feature is repeated accounting for the isotopic shift ( @xmath21 2 pm ) , the result remains the same .",
    "however , if the photospheric nickel abundance adopted by grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) is combined with the line strength inferred by allende prieto et al . , the resulting @xmath22value would be @xmath23 0.2 dex smaller than the laboratory measurement , which has an uncertainty of 0.05 dex . embracing the laboratory @xmath22value and",
    "the photospheric nickel abundance would imply a further reduction to the oxygen abundance by about 18 % or 0.08 dex , but koesterke et al .",
    "( see poster in these proceedings ) have found that the resulting spectrum is not compatible with the observed feature .",
    "it remains to be seen if a 3d - based analysis of nickel in the sun reduces this problem , but if we compare the meteoritic ni / si ratio of 0.048 with the photospheric value of @xmath24 , there is not enough room to accommodate the change in strength implied by the updated value of the transition probability .",
    "a subsequent reanalysis of the weaker 636.3 nm forbidden transition , using the same model yielded an abundance consistent with the value from the transition at 630.0 nm ( asplund et al .",
    "we recall that this feature was blended with two cn transitions , and the correction in this case is mainly linked to the change in model atmosphere , i.e. 1d vs. 3d , given the large sensitivity of molecular species to temperature inhomogeneities .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations have a horizontal average temperature lower than classical one - dimensional models in the outer layers , and temperature inhomogeneities further enhance the strength of the cn blending transition , resulting on a lower oxygen abundance .",
    "asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) collated the list of oxygen lines observed in the solar spectrum and selected a subset of six permitted transitions with accurate @xmath22values and clean profiles .",
    "some of these lines are suspected to suffer marked departures from local thermodynamical equilibrium since the early work by mihalas & henshaw ( 1966 ) and altrock ( 1968 ) .",
    "the analysis of oxygen lines in a three - dimensional solar - like model atmosphere considering non - lte was pioneered by kiselman & nordlund ( 1995 ) .",
    "interestingly , the calculated non - lte corrections for these lines from classical 1d models and from the hydrodynamical simulations are quite similar , and always work reducing the abundances derived assuming lte by an amount that ranges between 0.03 and 0.3 dex .",
    "purely 3d effects are usually smaller ( @xmath25 dex ) .",
    "approximate cross - sections for the collisional processes are typically used in the non - lte calculations .",
    "the relevant particles are electrons and hydrogen atoms . measurements of electron collisional excitation rates are limited to transitions from the ground state .",
    "widely - used general recipes based on the van regemorter ( 1962 ) formula can be widely applied , but are uncertain by a few orders of magnitude ( see , e.g. , allende prieto et al .",
    "more refined calculations exist for some transitions .",
    "recent independent calculations for low - lying states by zatsarinny & tayal ( 2003 ) and barklem ( 2007 ) typically agree within 70 % .",
    "the situation is worse for hydrogen collisions .",
    "a recipe originally proposed by steenbock & holweger ( 1984 ) based on drawin s approximation ( drawin 1968 , 1969 ) has been broadly used , despite it has been shown to overestimate the rates by several orders of magnitude for alkalis ( belyaev & barklem 2003 ) .",
    "this situation has led some modelers to neglect hydrogen collisions altogether in their calculations .",
    "while their effect is extremely important for low metallicity stars , it induces only modest changes in the inferred oxygen populations under solar conditions .",
    "the non - lte abundances derived by asplund et al .",
    "are in the range 8.608.65 , depending on the line , with an average result of 8.64 ( @xmath26 ) dex .",
    "these calculations neglect inelastic hydrogen collisions .",
    "the center - to - limb variation of permitted oxygen lines has been repeatedly used to demonstrate the need to consider departures from lte in their formation , but the same observations also favor including hydrogen collisions ( allende prieto , asplund & fabiani bendicho 2004 ) .",
    "if this path is taken , the average oxygen abundance from permitted lines would increase to 8.70 ( @xmath27 ) dex .",
    "as an example of the typical scatter found in oxygen non - lte calculations in the literature , we examine the 777.4 nm line , part of the infrared ( @xmath28s@xmath29@xmath28p ) triplet .",
    "asplund et al . inferred an abundance correction of @xmath30 dex for the 3d simulation , @xmath31 dex for the holweger - mller model ( holweger & mller 1974 ) , and @xmath32 for a solar marcs model ; allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using a different model atom and statistical equilibrium solver , derived a correction of @xmath33 dex for a kurucz solar model .",
    "these figures neglect inelastic hydrogen collisions .",
    "allende prieto et al . found an abundance correction of @xmath34 when h collisions were included using the recipe mentioned above .",
    "another study by holweger ( 2001 ) , based on a third choice of model atom and the holweger - mller atmosphere , but considering hydrogen collisions as above , arrived at a smaller correction of @xmath35 dex .",
    "hydrogen collisions in the non - lte calculations are likely the dominant contribution that sets the systematic errors in the abundances from permitted lines at about @xmath36 dex .",
    "asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) considered in their analysis oh pure rotation and oh vibration - rotation lines .",
    "the vast number of transitions and relatively small overlapping problems in the infrared are an advantage compared to using atomic lines .",
    "sadly , molecule formation is extremely temperature sensitive , and using a hydrodynamical model produces much larger corrections than for atomic transitions . the high sensitivity to temperature also implies a higher susceptibility to the details involved in the numerical simulations , such as resolution or boundary conditions . the formation of the lines in higher layers and therefore lower density also increases the risk for errors in the computed electron density , based on lte and chemical equilibrium for all relevant species .    despite the concerns , the average abundance derived from the solar 3d simulation by asplund et al . from vibro - rotational and pure rotational transitions",
    "agree remarkably well with each other : 8.61 ( @xmath37 ) and 8.65 ( @xmath38 ) , respectively . as expected",
    ", these figures involved substantial corrections in comparison with a 1d analysis : they are lower by about 0.2 dex .    the fact that the corrections associated with the introduction of hydrodynamics are larger for molecular transitions than for atomic lines underlines that both indicators can not agree with both kinds of models .",
    "this is evident in table 1 .",
    "indeed , the difference between the oxygen abundance inferred from atomic and molecular transitions is significantly smaller with the new hydrodynamical model than with the classical semi - empirical holweger - mller model .",
    "the solar 1d marcs model studied by asplund et al . turned out to take a more moderate position : with this model , atomic o and oh vibro - rotational lines converged at an abundance of @xmath39 , while only the oh rotational transitions pointed to a higher value by 0.1 dex .",

    "these authors find that the strongest @xmath40c @xmath41o lines , which form in very high layers , are not well reproduced by the model when the same abundances derived from other atomic and molecular lines are used , but weaker lines are perfectly consistent with the results from other features .",

    "the revision comes as the result of a conspiracy of corrections , and it is the outcome of a comprehensive and critical reanalysis of the available abundance indicators , considering improved model atmospheres , updated atomic data , non - lte corrections ( affecting permitted atomic transitions ) , and a reevaluation of the effect of blending features .",
    "the presence of temperature inhomogeneities has the largest impact on molecular species , while atomic permitted lines are only weakly affected .",
    "thus , the use of a hydrodynamical model of the solar surface is an important element to the correction , but using a theoretical hydrostatic model atmosphere leads to an average oxygen abundance modestly increased by 0.09 dex , and a carbon abundance only 0.02 dex higher .    as oxygen and carbon are the most abundant elements after hydrogen and helium , the revised abundances have a significant impact on the overall _ metallicity _ of the sun .",

    "models based on the new values predict the wrong value for the radius of the convection zone , and the radial variation of the sound speed inferred from seismic inversions is up to 10 % different from model predictions , while the older abundances yielded a much better agreement with deviations of just a few percent .",
    "if the revised abundances are correct , the blame must be somewhere else .",
    "the reported problems could be ameliorated , if not cured , with a new source of extra opacity below the convection zone .",

    "<S> a series of recent studies has placed the best estimates of the photospheric abundances of carbon and oxygen at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . these values are @xmath2 % lower than earlier estimates . </S>",
    "<S> a coalition of corrections due to the adoption of an improved model atmosphere , updated atomic data and non - lte corrections , and a reevaluation of the effect of blending features , is responsible for the change . </S>",
    "<S> the adopted hydrodynamical model of the solar surface is an important element to the update , but using a theoretical 1d model atmosphere leads to an average oxygen abundance modestly increased by 0.09 dex , and a carbon abundance only 0.02 dex higher . considering a state - of - the - art 3d hydrodynamical model of the solar surface yields consistent results from different sets of atomic and molecular lines . </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors are likely to dominate the final uncertainties , but the available information indicates they are limited to @xmath3 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the new abundances are closer to expectations based on the compositions of other nearby objects , although a fully consistent picture , considering galactic chemical evolution and diffusion at the bottom of the solar convection zone , is still lacking . </S>"
