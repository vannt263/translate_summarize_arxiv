    "the subclassification of high - energy bursting phenomena relies , for good reason , on the properties of the prompt emission . yet",
    "whether the diversity of burst duration and spectral hardness reflects a true diversity in the physics of the explosions and the nature of the progenitors , was largely a leap of faith for the vast majority of grbs .",
    "soft - gamma ray repeaters aside , there was until 2005 little evidence to suggest a real difference between long - soft ( lsb ) and short - hard ( shb ) grbs @xcite .",
    "following the first rapid locations of shbs by swift @xcite and _ hete-2 _ @xcite , the first x - ray afterglows were found @xcite , allowing for an unprecedented localization of five shbs .",
    "k.  hurley gave an excellent and thorough overview of high - energy properties of short - hard bursts in this conference .",
    "what has emerged with the limited set of shbs are both commonalities and striking differences between the two populations .",
    "broadband modeling @xcite has shown a broad consistency of afterglows with the external shock model .",
    "as predicted @xcite , because the luminosity of the afterglow scales with the input energy of the explosion , the afterglows of shbs appear to be fainter analogues of lsbs .",
    "moreover , there is now evidence that short bursts are weakly collimated with half angle jetting of more than 10% ( see @xcite ) . yet unlike with the relatively coperative lsbs , it may be some time before a definitive observation reveals the origin of short bursts : the best smoking gun for the merger hypthothesis is a concident detection of a burst of gravitational waves .    thankfully , the progenitors of cosmic explosions are observationally manifested on length scales ranging from circumburst to galaxy cluster .",
    "indeed , a census of the _ types of host galaxies _ of sne beginning in the 1950s yielded insights into the various progenitors : reaves @xcite noticed that type i ( now subclassed as ia ) sne occurred in galaxies of all sorts whereas type ii arise from essentially only in late - types .",
    "this observation is fully borne out in modern studies @xcite . likewise",
    ", systematic surveys of the _ locations of sne around galaxies _ further informed the progenitor question .",
    "van dyk @xcite concluded that the location of sns `` suggest that type ia supernovae do not arise from massive short - lived stellar populations .",
    "type ib / ic and type ii supernovae , however , are very likely to be associated with h ii regions and therefore with massive stellar progenitors . ''",
    "recently , measurements of the _ redshift distribution _ of ia sne have shown evidence for delay since starburst @xcite .",
    "all such observations of sne on large scales support the established belief from detailed modeling of the transient emission that massive young stars are responsible for type ii sne and degenerate old stars are responsible for ia sne .",
    "as reviewed below , the quest for an understanding of the progenitors of lsbs benefited from a similar analysis of observations on large scales .",
    "now , thanks to the breakthrough localization of afterglows and motivated by past work with sne and lsbs , the search for the origin of shbs is following parallel ( productive ) tracks .",
    "basic properties of short - hard grb hosts [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : off ]    in light of the lsb location results , one of the startling observations of shb 050509b was not only the statistical connection to a low - redshift giant elliptical galaxy , but , if the connection were true , the relatively large offset from that galaxy . whereas no lsb had been found more than 10 kpc in projection from a putative host , the first shb was well - localized at 39 @xmath0 13 kpc in projection .",
    "this , in and of itself , is suggestive of a different population of progenitors for shbs .",
    "in contrast , the location of shb 050709 , on the outskirts of a faint star - burst galaxy bears a striking resemblance to the burst - host configuration of lsb 970228 . as with lsbs ,",
    "analysis of _ individual _ locations would clearly lead to diverse conclusions about the nature of the progenitors .",
    "thankfully , while there are only 5 shbs with @xmath1arcsec localizations ( see table [ tab : off ] ) , we are now in the position to begin to test various progenitor scenarios5 kpc ) to their hosts based on the cumulative offset distribution presented in figure 22 of fryer , woosley , hartmann @xcite .",
    "it appears that the scale of the x ( distance ) axis in that figure is incorrect by an order of magnitude with respect the differential distributions shown in figure 21 . to be sure , the median offset for an @xmath2 galaxy is @xmath110 kpc , which is consistent with other simulations from other groups . ] . what can be stated with certainty",
    "is shbs do not all arise from the central activity of galaxies . following figure [ fig : off ] shbs _ appear _ to be more diffusely positioned around galaxies than lsbs .",
    "but , owing to the small numbers and sometimes large uncertainties in the offset measurements , we find that the locations of shbs are still statistically significant ( @xmath3 ) with having been drawn from the same population of as lsbs .",
    "the search for the origin(s ) of shbs presents a substantial challenge relative to discovery of long - burst progenitors : there is no obvious smoking gun for short burst progenitors that have not already been looked for . whereas an obvious manifestation of the collapsar model was the connection to star forming hosts and star forming regions within hosts , viable progenitor models predict offsets and locations within hosts that are far from robust .",
    "so what may we conclude about how the current host observations of shbs relative to lsbs reflect the progenitors ?",
    "a secure statement is that `` shb hosts contain a generally older population of stars than lsb '' and a reasonable , but somewhat more directed statement is that `` shbs come from an old stellar population whereas lsbs do not . '' what we think is still a matter of debate",
    "is whether  the frequency of early - type to late - type hosts for shb is consistent with ns  ns \" ( e.  ramirez - ruiz discussed his views on this in the conference ) .",
    "similar statements can be made of the offset distribution of shbs : yes , there appears to be some differences between lsbs and shbs but nothing stastistically significant at this time .",
    "what appears relatively secure , based on the small offsets of three of 5 shbs from low - mass galaxies is that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * the progenitors of shbs can not have both large systematic kicks ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) at formation and inhere large delay times from starburst ( @xmath6 gyr)*. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    making even stronger statements about the nature of the progenitors is not only hampered by small number statistics but in the lack of robust predictions from the models .",
    "but the above statement can be reworked in the form of a generic set of predictions :    * in long delay ( @xmath71 gyr ) progenitors scenarios with kicks the offsets should anti - correlate with host mass and correlate with average stellar age * in short delay ( @xmath8 1 gyr ) progenitors the offsets should correlate with host mass and anti - correlate with average stellar age .    if the progenitor lifetime of the shbs is long and kicks are small , then the bursts should correspond spatially to the oldest stellar populations in a given galaxies .",
    "for early - type galaxies , the distribution would presumably follow the light of the galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the distribution in star - forming galaxies might be more concentrated in the spheroid ( e.g. , bulge of the milky way ) .    those of us that have worked on creating _ ab initio _",
    "predictions for ns ",
    "ns progenitors all basically agree on the offsets and delays provided we use a production channel dominated by binaries where the helium stars do not fill their respective roche lobe before exploding as a sn .",
    "but other productions might dominate , leading to predictions of relatively short merger times and small offsets @xcite . both t.  piran and j.",
    "grindlay discussed other production channels in the conference .",
    "for example , if shbs arise from ns binaries made in the centers of globular clusters @xcite , then the offsets should scale with the halo size of the host ( rather than exponential disk size ) and the systemic kicks could be small .",
    "this results in diverse predictions of offsets and host demography for the same progenitors .    fostered by the presence of a curious 100 sec timescale for prompt emission and lacking the detection of a li - paczyski minisupernova @xcite",
    ", the theory community is rapidly developing other progenitor models for shbs such as wd ",
    "wd mergers @xcite and accretion induced collapse of a ns @xcite . in this respect the connection of grbs with sne",
    "may not only be a historical one , there may be a deeper analogy : long - soft grbs are to core - collapased supernovae as short - hard grbs are to type ia supernovae ( `` lsb : cc::shb : ia '' ) .",
    "not only does this ring true for the hosts and locations ( like type ia sne , short bursts can occur outside star forming regions in galaxies of any type , whereas , like core - collapsed sne , long bursts only occur near star forming regions of galaxies actively forming stars ) but could also reflect a symmetry of the progenitors : lsbs result from a special ( extreme ? ) version of core - collapased massive young stars whereas shbs might arise in the ns to bh transition ( and ia sns in wd to ns transition ) .",
    "whether the lsb : cc::shb : ia analogy will hold at the physical level remains to be seen .",
    "but as progenitor predictions for shbs are honed , new shb offsets plus inferences of the host mass will continue to constrain . still , a direct comparison with model predictions will also be hampered by the possibly of an  ambient density bias , \" where afterglows , the brightnesses of which scale as the circumburst density to the half power , are more likely to be discovered if the burst occurs in regions of larger density .",
    "are we missing a population of bursts at large offsets that occur in the intergalactic medium ?",
    "if the internal shock paradigm for short burst holds then @xmath1arcsecond location of the prompt emission in future missions should be immune to this bias .",
    "last , we note that while shb afterglow follow - up tends to be more difficult than lhbs , one positive result of the low @xmath9 nature of detected shbs is that we may have the possibility of resolving the sub - structure of the birthsites within galaxies ( e.g. , spiral arms , h ii regions ) using hst and groundbased adaptive optics .",
