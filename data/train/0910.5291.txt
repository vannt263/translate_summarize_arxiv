    "in the standard fireball model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; see reviews by piran 2005 ; mszros 2005 ) , the grb prompt emission is considered to arise from an internal dissipation in a relativistic expanding fireball , while the afterglow emission is produced by the deceleration of the fireball by circumburst medium , i.e. , a blast wave . as understood above , it seems unlikely to directly find information about the grb central engine , which drives the fireball , from the observed emission .",
    "however , based on some observational constraints and theoretical simulations , it is widely accepted that black holes or rapidly spinning magnetars ( highly - magnetized pulsars ) formed during the death of the progenitors play an important role in driving the fireball .",
    "furthermore , the _ swift_-discovered delayed intermittent bright x - ray flares demonstrate that the grb central objects should be still very active after the bursts ( burrows et al . 2005 ; yu & dai 2009 ) .",
    "analogically , the shallow - decaying segment remarkably appearing in the canonical x - ray light curve ( nousek et al 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) also strongly implies an energy injection into the grb blast waves , which is quite likely to result from a long - lasting energy release from the central objects . under these requirements , spinning - down magnetars are usually suggested as grb central objects in the literature ( e.g. , bucciantini et al .",
    "2009 ; corsi & mszros 2009 ; dai 2004 ; dai et al .",
    "2006 ; de pasquale et al . 2007 ;",
    "zhang & dai 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "the shallow - decaying afterglows can somewhat be regarded as an observational signature of rapidly spinning magntetars ( dai & lu 1998a , b ; yu & dai 2007 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .    in particular , a nearly - constant x - ray emission followed by a very steep decline with a temporal index of @xmath0",
    "was reported in grb 070110 by troja et al .",
    "the abrupt cutoff of the x - ray light curve robustly indicates that this plateau emission is of  internal \" origin , ruling out the external shock model .",
    "moreover , the observed luminosity and duration of the plateau are well consistent with the parameters of a newly born magnetar .",
    "so , following zhang & mszros ( 2001 ) , troja et al .",
    "( 2007 ) further argued that this puzzling plateau could be directly produced by the internal dissipation of the magnetar - driven wind at small radii , before the energy of the wind is deposited into the grb blast wave .",
    "then , the observed luminosity of the plateau tracking the spin - down luminosity of the grb magnetar makes it possible to  directly \" explore the properties of the central objects by using observed emission .",
    "as a pioneering attempt , lyons et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigated the magnetic and rotational properties of the central magnetars for ten grb 070110-like grbs .",
    "while the inferred magnetic field strengthes are basically typical for magnetars , the spin periods are usually found to be as short as the kepler period , sometimes even at thousands of seconds after the grb trigger .",
    "however , for a magnetar composing of normal neutron matter ( i.e. , neutron star ; ns ) , it seems difficult to keep nearly - kepler spin for more than one thousand seconds , because the spin of the nascent ns could be sorely restricted by some stellar instabilities , especially , _",

    "letter _ ( s 2004 ; s & tom 2005 , 2006 ; yu et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in contrast , for a magnetar composing of strange quark matter ( i.e. , strange star ; ss ) , the _ r_-modes - induced limit on the stellar spin is absent during the early ages of the star , because of the effective suppression of the",
    "_ r_-modes by the quark matter s bulk viscosity ( e.g. , wang & lu 1984 ; madsen 1998 ; zheng et al .",
    "therefore , we argue that _ a newly born magnetar , which can maintain constant rapid spin for a long period of time , could be a ss candidate_. based on this consideration , we propose that _ the sample of the grb rapidly - spinning magnetars can be used to test the ss hypothesis . _    in the next section , we briefly review the magnetar model for the internal - plateau emission , and then some magnetar parameters are derived from a small grb sample . in sect .",
    "3 , we analysis the _ r_-mode limit on the spin of nss in the framework of a second - order _ r_-mode model developed by s ( 2004 ) . by confronting the _ r_-mode limit with the grb magnetar sample",
    ", we makes an attempt to find ss candidates .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion are given in sect .",
    "as discussed above , the internal - plateau emission indicates that a rapidly spinning magnetar has been formed as a central object during the prompt phase of some grbs .",
    "the initial spin - down of a magnetar could be very complicated during the first tens of seconds after its birth .",
    "on the longer timescales that we are interested in , some short - term processes such as neutrino - driven winds could be no longer important .",
    "we here simply consider that the nascent magnetar spins down through magnetic dipole radiation as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spin period of the star .",
    "the magnetic braking timescale reads ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the inertial of moment , the radius , and the surface magnetic field strength of the magnetar , respectively .",
    "the convention @xmath8 is adopted in cgs units hereafter . eq .",
    "( [ magbrake ] ) yields @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the initial spin period and @xmath11 the expression of @xmath12 shows that a nascent magnetar only against the magnetic braking effect can keep nearly - constant spin for a period of time of @xmath13 . as the spinning down",
    ", the magnetar releases the spining energy and drives an outwards - propagating wind .",
    "we then approximately estimate the luminosity of the wind by the magnetically spin - down luminosity as @xmath14 with @xmath15    since the observed internal - plateau emission is deemed to be directly emitted by magnetar winds , the model quantities @xmath16 and @xmath13 can be easily determined by the observational isotropically - equivalent luminosity @xmath17 and the observational duration @xmath18 of the plateaus as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the redshifts of the grbs .",
    "the beaming factor @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the half - opening angle of the winds is introduced because the magnetar winds could be collimated rather than perfectly isotropic ( bucciantini et al .",
    "2007 ; lyons et al . 2009 ) . by solving eq.([l and tau ] ) , the magnetic field strengthes and the initial spin periods of the grb magnetars can be derived as @xmath23 the greater - than and less - than signs appear in eqs .",
    "( [ l and tau])-([pi ] ) , because the radiation efficiency of the winds should be lower than 100% and the cutoff of the plateaus could be caused by a rapid decrease of the stellar magnetic fields ( troja et al .",
    "2007 ) or by a collapse of the magnetars into black holes ( lyons et al . 2009 ) . in this _ letter _ , for simplicity , we only consider the case of equality for eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) as an extreme case , as did in lyons et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    ".the observed properties of the internal plateaus of ten grbs@xmath24 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath24see lyons et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for a detailed explanation of the data .    in order to conveniently estimate the values of @xmath7 and @xmath10 for specific grbs in the @xmath25 panel , we plot in fig .",
    "1 a set of dashed lines for different values of @xmath7 and a set of dotted lines for different values of @xmath10 , which are respectively determined by @xmath26 where a typical value of unit is adopted for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in view of the sufficiently small variations of these parameters . for a realistic magnetar , its rotation obviously can not be rapider than the kepler rotation , at which the star starts shedding mass at the equator .",
    "so an absolute upper limit on the spin periods of magnetars is given by the kepler period ( haensel et al .",
    "2009 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gravitational mass of the magnetar . for the prefactor @xmath31 , the careful numerical calculation given by haensel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that its value is slightly dependent on the equation of state of the stellar matter , specifically , @xmath32ms for nss and @xmath33ms for sss .",
    "for a conservative discussion , we simply take @xmath34ms for both nss and sss as proposed by lattimer & prakash ( 2004 ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we also scatter the observational internal - plateau data of ten grbs as listed in table 1 , which survived from an internal - plateau test in lyons et al .",
    "( 2009 ) with three criterions : ( 1 ) the x - ray light curve could not be adequately fitted by the willingale model ( willingale et al .",
    "2007 ) ; ( 2 ) a relatively constant x - ray flux lasts for a significant period of time ; and ( 3 ) the plateau is followed by a convincing steep decline with a temporal index @xmath35 , so that the internal origin of the plateau is favored . under the isotropic assumption for the magnetar winds , the data ( open circles )",
    "is obviously in contradiction with the kepler limit . so as suggested by lyons et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we should adjust the vertical locations of the data to fit the requirement of the kepler limit , by varying the value of the remaining free parameter @xmath22 .",
    "then we get @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) by assuming the fastest possible period as the kepler period . taking this angle as the beaming angle for each grb ,",
    "we replot the observational data using solid asterisks in fig . 1 .",
    "1 , the magnetic field strengthes can be found to be around typical values of @xmath38 gauss for magnetars .",
    "besides that , we especially notice that a long - lasting rapid spin with a period of @xmath39ms is required for the magnetars in grbs 060607a and 070110 .",
    "however , for a perfectly fluid compact star with arbitrary rotation , _ r_-mode oscillation can arise due to the action of the coriolis force with positive feedback and tends to be unstable ( andersson 1998 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ) , succumbing to gravitational radiation - driven chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability ( chandrasekhar 1970 ; friedman & schutz 1978 ) . as a result , the rapid spin of newly born nss can be reduced early and remarkably by the strong gravitational radiation , but can not for nascent sss .",
    "then , the question arises as to whether the grb rapidly - spinning magnetars are nss or sss , or whether we can find ss candidates from grb magnetars .    following a phenomenological model for _ r_-modes proposed by s ( 2004 ) , the evolution of the amplitude of the _ r_-mode oscillation , @xmath40 , can be calculated from ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ; s & tom 2005 ; yu et al . 2009 ) @xmath41{\\alpha\\over\\tau_g}-\\left[1+{\\alpha^{2}\\over30}(4{\\delta}+5)\\right ] { \\alpha\\over\\tau_v}+{\\alpha\\over2\\tau_m},\\label{alphat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a free parameter describing the initial degree of the differential rotation of a nascent magnetar , @xmath43 is the gravitational radiation timescale , and @xmath44 is the viscous damping timescale with @xmath45 and @xmath46 corresponding to the shear and bulk viscosities , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the spin - down of the magnetar against both gravitational and magnetic braking effects is determined by @xmath47 in the case of @xmath48 where the _ r_-modes can not arise sufficiently rapidly , the above equation can be well approximated by eq.([magbrake ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath49 , the spin - down is instead dominated by the gravitational braking , if the _ r_-mode amplitude can reach its saturated value in time under a condition of @xmath50 . however , the value of @xmath51 is sensitive to the properties of the stellar matter .",
    "to be specific , we display the viscous damping timescales for a ns and a ss respectively as ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ; madsen 2000)k as in nascent magnetars concerned in this _ letter _ , the bulk viscosity of the superconducting matter could be still comparable to that of the unpaired quark matter ( e.g. , alford & schmitt 2007 ) . ] : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the stellar temperature . for a nascent magnetar with @xmath54k and @xmath55 , on one hand , the shear viscous damping of the _ r_-modes",
    "can be neglected undoubtedly , no matter whether the star is a ns or a ss due to @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the significant difference between @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) would lead to two distinct results : ( 1 ) for a nascent ss , the _",
    "r_-mode instability is suppressed effectively by the bulk viscosity . by equaling @xmath61 to @xmath59 to get @xmath62 and following the direct - urca - process - dominated cooling @xmath63 with @xmath64s , we can find that it should take about @xmath65s to achieve @xmath66 at which _ r_-modes can arise . during this long period of time of @xmath65s , the spin - down of the ss",
    "is exclusively dominated by the relatively stronger magnetic dipole radiation ( zheng et al .",
    "therefore , the upper limit of the spin periods of nascent sss can be simply set at the kepler period .",
    "( 2 ) in contrast , for nascent nss , _",
    "r_-modes can arise rapidly and arrive at its saturated amplitude within hundreds of seconds ( s & tom 2005 , 2006 ) . as a result",
    ", the spin - down of the nss would be first dominated by the gravitational braking , much before the magnetic braking operates ( yu et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "now let us investigate how long a nascent ns against _",
    "r_-mode instability can keep constant spin with @xmath67 . in view of @xmath68 , eqs .",
    "( [ alphat ] ) and ( [ omegat ] ) can be solved analytically by ignoring the magnetic and viscous terms . for convenience ,",
    "we here exhibit an asymptotic solution as ( s & tom 2005 , 2006 ) @xmath69^{-1},&{\\rm for}~t < t_{g}\\\\ 1.6p_i\\left({t\\over\\tau_{g , i}}\\right)^{1/5},&{\\rm for}~t > t_{g } \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the initial _ r_-mode amplitude .",
    "the break time @xmath71 can be solved from @xmath72 to be @xmath73\\left({p_i\\over p_k}\\right)^6\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&t_{k}(\\alpha_i,{\\delta})\\left({p_i\\over p_k}\\right)^6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at which @xmath74 .",
    "after @xmath71 , the spin period of the ns can no longer be regarded as a constant and the luminosity of the wind evolves as @xmath75 , which obviously deviates from a plateau emission .",
    "so we conclude that _ a nascent ns with an initial period @xmath10 can keep nearly constant spin for at most a period of time of @xmath76 . _ for @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 . within a wide parameter region of @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "( s & tom 2005 , 2006 ) , the value of @xmath81 varies from 170 s to 840 s.    therefore , for grb magnetars with @xmath82s , it is necessary to test whether their spin is sufficiently slow to determine a sufficiently long @xmath71 as @xmath83 if not , the magnetar is quiet unlikely to be a ns .",
    "alternatively , it could be a ss candidate . substituting eq.([pr ] ) into ( [ logltp1 ] ) with @xmath84 , we can obtain @xmath85 with a certain value of the free parameter @xmath86 , this equation determines a _",
    "r_-mode limit line for nss in the @xmath87 panel , as shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "2 , above which @xmath88 .    _ then an especial region below the kepler limit line and above the _",
    "r_-mode limit line is highlighted in the @xmath87 panel , where only sss can appear .",
    "_ when we use this ss - only region to cover the observational grb internal - plateau data , we can obtain that either ( 1 ) some ss candidates are indicated by the data locating in the ss - only region , or ( 2 ) all data are clearly below the _ r_-mode limit line .",
    "in the latter case , the ss model can not be in principle ruled out , but the influence of the gravitational radiation - driven _ r_-mode instability on the spin of nss would be confirmed . for the small sample of grb magnetars listed in table 1 , we find in fig .",
    "2 that grb 060607a locates just above the _",
    "r_-mode limit line , by assuming the fastest possible period as the kepler period ( @xmath89 ) and taking @xmath90s .",
    "this implies that the magnetar in grb 060607a could be a ss .",
    "it is fair to say , though , that the uncertainties and approximations involved could be large enough that the ns model might be still available for this magnetar .",
    "so a much richer grb sample is sorely demanded in order to get a more definite conclusion .",
    "the internal - plateau emission is considered to indicate that a central rapidly - spinning magnetar is formed during some grbs .",
    "such a newly born magnetar is sometimes required to be able to keep a rapid spin with a sub- or millisecond period for thousands of seconds . then , according to the spin limit of nascent nss due to _ r_-mode instability , we propose a method to identify ss candidates from the grb magnetars , since the _",
    "r_-mode instability can not operate in nascent sss . despite the smallness of the present grb magnetar sample , the effectiveness of the method is somewhat exhibited by the appearance of grb 060607a .",
    "a few decades ago , the concept of ss was proposed formerly as a new and novel class of compact stars ( alcock et al .",
    "1986 ; haensel et al .",
    "1986 ) and even as grb central objects ( cheng & dai 1996 , 1998 ; dai & lu 1998a ) , based on a conjecture that the true ground state of matter is strange quark matter rather than fe@xmath91 ( witten 1984 ) . in both physics and astronomy , it is of significant importance to identify or rule out sss from observational astrophysical objects .",
    "seasonably , a plausible method was designed by madsen ( 1998 ) according to the distinct rotational properties of nss and sss against the _ r_-mode instability . however , for most detected galactic millisecond pulsars , the stellar temperature is generally much lower than @xmath92k , in which case some complications arise from the shear viscosity due to the stellar crust ( e.g. , bildsten & ushomirsky 2000 ) and the superfluidity appearing in the stellar core .",
    "this makes it difficult to distinguish sss from nss within the galactic pulsar sample ( madsen 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , the situation in newly born pulsars would be much clearer due to their sufficiently high temperature .",
    "moreover , for grb magnetars , a relatively richer sample could be selected from the huge grb storage , in contrast to the rare observation of newly born pulsars in the galaxy . in view of these advantages , it is worthwhile to use the newly - born grb magnetars to test the ss hypothesis .",
    "however , it should be notice that the uncertainties and approximations of the model still prohibit the present small grb magnetar sample from becoming a gold sample for testing ss hypothesis .",
    "therefore , it is demanded to make great efforts in following aspects : ( 1 ) a thorough investigation on magnetar wind .",
    "here we would like to point out that the angle of the magnetar wind is probably different from that of the grb ejecta , in respect that the grb ejecta could be driven by an hyperaccretion onto the magnetar rather than the magnetar wind ( zhang & dai 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "( 2 ) finding other constraints on the wind angle . for example , in order to build up sufficient dynamo action responsible for the intense magnetic fields , the initial spin periods of magentars could be required to be @xmath93 ms ( lyons et al .",
    "2009 ; usov 1992 ) , which leads to @xmath94 ; ( 3 ) accumulating a much larger number of grb magnetars .",
