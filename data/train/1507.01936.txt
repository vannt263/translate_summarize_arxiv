    "the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) is the phenomenon where the unitary evolution of a quantum state can be suppressed e.g. by interactions with the environment or frequently performing measurements on the state @xcite .",
    "the qze is of interest in various fields and topics in physics , including decaying systems , trapped cold atoms , quantum computation , ( nonlinear ) optics and quantum foundations @xcite .",
    "additionally , the qze has been implemented in a quantum protocol using entanglement to improve a communication complexity problem ( ccp ) beyond classical limitation @xcite .",
    "a ccp is typically described by two parties alice and bob who aim to compute the value of a function @xmath1 , depending on bit - strings @xmath2 , one given to alice and one to bob , despite restricted communication .",
    "the task is to maximize the probability that bob computes @xmath3 , given that alice may communicate no more than @xmath4 bits to bob .",
    "naturally , this allows for various generalizations e.g. ccps involving many parties or high - level inputs .",
    "it is well known that quantum entanglement can give rise to correlations that do not admit a local model @xcite and that such correlations can be implemented with local information processing to improve ccps beyond classical protocols @xcite .",
    "close links have been established between bell inequality violation and reduction of communication complexity @xcite , providing a fundamental understanding for why quantum entanglement achieves complexity reduction .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that quantum reduction of communication complexity can be achieved without shared entangled states . in @xcite ,",
    "quantum strategies for two particular ccps , relying only on sequential communication of a single quantum two - level system ( qubit ) , were shown to lower complexity beyond classical limitations . indeed , the superiority of these quantum strategies can no longer be explained by violations of bell inequalities .",
    "also in other communications tasks , where the quantum advantages previously stemmed from bell inequality violations , has it been shown that the single qubit can be used to outperform classical protocols @xcite .",
    "the single qubit protocols are not only conceptually interesting but also tend to be more scalable than the protocols based on entanglement , making them feasible for experimental implementations .    in this paper , we introduce a family of ccps , generalizing the particular ccp in @xcite , and investigate classical and quantum solutions . in particular , we aim to answer two questions ( 1 ) how does entanglement and a single quantum @xmath0-level system ( qudit ) perform as resources for reduction of communication complexity ? , and ( 2 ) do protocols that use the qze perform better than protocols that do not ? in our investigation , we will provide three quantum solutions to our ccps , ( i ) using entanglement and the qze , ( ii ) using a single qudit and the qze , and finally ( iii ) using single qudit without the qze .",
    "the final protocol is argued to be experimentally feasible and scalable , and we will provide an experimental demonstration of quantum reduction of communication complexity .",
    "the class of ccps we consider is described as follows : imagine that a distributor supplies @xmath5 parties @xmath6 with inputs in such a way that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , whereas parties @xmath11 are given two inputs each , @xmath12 .",
    "all inputs are elements of the set @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a large integer , which are publicly announced by the distributor . in addition , for @xmath16 define sets @xmath17 , where addition is taken modulo @xmath18 , with some publicly announced positive integer @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "the distributor promises the parties that each pair of inputs @xmath21 obeys @xmath22 for some @xmath23 .",
    "the ccp facing the @xmath5 parties is for @xmath24 to communicate at most one @xmath0-level of information to @xmath25 for @xmath26 , in such a way that @xmath8 with high probability can announce a value @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "thus , each ccp is characterized by the numbers @xmath29 .",
    "let us begin with considering classical strategies for our family of ccps .",
    "this problem was considered for @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xcite and we now solve the more general classical problem .",
    "firstly , let us consider only two parties involved . since the distribution of the inputs in the ccp are given on advance , we can without loss of generality restrict to deterministic classical strategies , i.e. strategies that are not randomized according to some pre - established rule .",
    "@xmath7 must then use a function @xmath32 to determine the value of the classical @xmath0-level that is sent to @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath18 possible values of the input @xmath34 can be represented as dots forming a circle . due to the distributor s promise , for a given input @xmath35 of @xmath33",
    ", there are only @xmath36 allowed possible values of @xmath34 , all equally probable . for given @xmath35 , the possible values of @xmath34 can be represented by the @xmath19 dots on either side of the particular elements constituting vertices of the regular convex polygon with @xmath0 sides that has one vertex on the dot representing @xmath35 , see figure .",
    "numbers can be imagined as dots on a circle . for given @xmath35 ,",
    "the allowed values of @xmath34 are given by the @xmath19 numbers on either side of the dots that constitutes vertices of the regular convex polygon with one vertex at @xmath35 .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath37 , @xmath31 and @xmath38 . ]",
    "@xmath7 divides the circle into @xmath0 equal parts , each containing @xmath15 subsequent dots .",
    "this division can be made arbitrarily since the distribution of the inputs is uniform .",
    "for simplicity , make divisions @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath7 uses @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "it is evident that whenever all the elements @xmath43 for some @xmath4 , @xmath44 will always give @xmath33 the information necessary to with certainty find @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "whenever not all of the elements @xmath47 are members of @xmath48 for some @xmath4 , then there is a probability that @xmath33 does not manage to find @xmath45 .",
    "the error rate depends on how many of the @xmath49 numbers that are inside some @xmath48 .",
    "evidently , if we have the first @xmath50 numbers in @xmath48 and the final @xmath51 numbers in @xmath52 , @xmath33 will guess that @xmath42 and have a probability of @xmath53 to succeed . from the @xmath18",
    "possible values of @xmath35 , only @xmath54 choices introduce an error . therefore , the average probability of error is found from @xmath55 this constitutes the error probability for two parties executing the protocol .",
    "however , in the classical strategy , this procedure is simply repeated @xmath56 times , once between each pair @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the @xmath5 parties , with each party @xmath24 adding to his input the received value of its previous execution of the protocol with @xmath57 .",
    "the protocol succeeds whenever there is either no error in any of the executions , or if the errors cancel each other out . for large @xmath58",
    ", we can neglect the possibility of canceling errors and thus the error probability for @xmath5 parties could be estimated by @xmath59 we can conclude that the probability of error is proportional to @xmath60 . however , if we have @xmath61 , we can not neglect the possibility of errors canceling so breaks down . in analogy with the argument in @xcite , the success probability the protocol drops to the vicinity of @xmath62 which is the trivial strategy where @xmath8 takes a random guess on the answer to the ccp . to our knowledge , a proof of the optimal classical strategy is not known .",
    "let us investigate quantum strategies , and firstly let consider the protocol based on entanglement which exploits the qze and let us called it @xmath63 .",
    "this protocol is the generalization of the know result of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath33 share the entangled state @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath7 will use his input @xmath9 to locally perform a unitary transformation @xmath65 on his part of the shared state .",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 locally performs @xmath68 .",
    "then , @xmath7 and @xmath33 perform local measurements of their part of the state in the fourier basis given by @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting probability distribution over the respective outcomes @xmath70 and @xmath71 of @xmath7 and @xmath33 is @xmath72\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] however , due to the promise from the distributor we can write @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 . since @xmath76 , outcomes of the form @xmath77 occur with high probability , and we can choose @xmath78 in @xmath0 different ways such that this relation is satisfied . to bound @xmath79 from below , we neglect the contribution from the sine terms , put @xmath80 , decouple the cosine expression from the sum by putting @xmath81 and use the small angle approximation @xmath82 , thus finding @xmath83 hence , let @xmath7 communicate his outcome @xmath70 to @xmath33 , who computes @xmath84 and then with a high probability knows that @xmath85 .",
    "this accounts for the first step in the protocol .",
    "however , it is easily realized that each pair of subsequent parties @xmath24 and @xmath25 can use the above protocol with their inputs @xmath21 and @xmath24 adding his outcome @xmath86 to the message received from @xmath57 and communicating this to @xmath25 . thus , after the required @xmath56 executions of the protocol , @xmath8 will be able to announce the correct value @xmath45 such that @xmath87 if and only if there was either no error in any of the @xmath56 executions , or if the errors cancel each other out .",
    "however , for errors to cancel there must be at least two failed steps .",
    "similar to the above classical case , we consider large @xmath58 and thus neglect cases with more than one error occurring allowing us to approximate the success probability as @xmath88 . to good accuracy , we can bound the quantum success probability from below by considering only the two first terms i.e. @xmath89 this shows that the error probability in the ccp characterized by the tuple @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath90 , thus lowering communication complexity beyond what was achieved with the classical protocol .",
    "let us now consider quantum solutions to the ccp using only a single qudit .",
    "our protocol @xmath91 will rely on sequential communication of a single qudit with only the final recipient performing a measurement .",
    "thus , @xmath91 is not a manifestation of the qze since we are not suppressing the unitary evolution with repeated measurements .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that complexity can be reduced beyond classical limitations .",
    "let @xmath7 prepare the uniform superposition state @xmath92 .",
    "now , @xmath7 acts with the local unitary @xmath65 ( used in protocol @xmath63 ) on @xmath93 and then communicates the qudit to @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 transforms the state by applying @xmath94 and communicates the qudit to @xmath95 .",
    "parties @xmath96 act in analogy with @xmath33 . when the quantum system is given to @xmath8 , he performs @xmath97 .",
    "the final state of the system is @xmath98 .",
    "finally , @xmath8 performs a measurement on the qudit in the fourier basis .",
    "the outcome of @xmath8 s measurement is labeled @xmath23 and is subject to a probability distribution @xmath99\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] due to the distributor s promise , we write @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "hence we can write @xmath103 where we have let @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath106 and @xmath107 . however , @xmath108 can be reduced modulo @xmath0 without loss of generality .",
    "the ccp is successfully solved if @xmath8 finds @xmath109 . applying approximations similar to what was used to obtain",
    ", we find that @xmath110 @xmath111 indeed , the protocol @xmath91 can reduce communication complexity beyond the classical protocol .",
    "the above lower bound on success probability differs from obtained using entanglement by being quadratic in @xmath56 .",
    "however , in cases where @xmath15 is sufficiently larger than @xmath5 , the difference between and becomes negligible .",
    "however , the drop in success probability should not be interpreted as originating from the use of a single qudit instead of entanglement as a resource , but rather as consequence of not using the qze to suppress the unitary evolution of the state .",
    "this is a manifestation of the qze contributing to reduction of communication complexity , in addition to the quantum resource .",
    "to support this claim , we will now construct a single qudit protocol , @xmath112 , for the family of ccps that reproduces the success probability in by invoking the qze .    in @xmath112",
    ", @xmath7 prepares the same state as in @xmath91 , that is : @xmath92 , performs the unitary action @xmath65 , and sends the qudit to @xmath33 who performs @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath33 then measures the qudit in the fourier basis using a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement .",
    "this renders the system in one of the @xmath0 states forming the fourier basis .",
    "then , @xmath33 applies applies @xmath113 to the system and communicates the state to @xmath95 .",
    "parties @xmath96 act in analogy with @xmath33 i.e. each will perform a unitary rotation , a qnd measurement in the fourier basis , and finally another unitary rotation after which they communicate the system to the subsequent party .",
    "when @xmath8 obtains the qudit , he performs @xmath97 and then measures ( need not be a qnd measurement ) the system in the fourier basis , and uses the outcome to with high probability solve the ccp .",
    "the use of the qze plays an important role in the efficiency of protocol @xmath112 .",
    "since every pair of neighboring parties perform some unitaries on the system and then do a qnd measurement , we can imagine @xmath112 as each pair of neighbors running the protocol @xmath91 throughout the line of all @xmath5 parties .",
    "that is , the probability of the outcome of the first qnd measurement , performed by the second party in the protocol , to be associated to a successful outcome amounts to putting @xmath114 in .",
    "since with @xmath114 , becomes equivalent to , the success probability of @xmath112 when run for @xmath5 parties becomes the equivalent to what was obtained using entanglement by invoking the same approximations .",
    "let us now compare the strengths and weaknesses of the three quantum protocols .",
    "indeed , since @xmath91 does not exploit the qze , it performs worse than the other two protocols .",
    "however , both single qudit protocols but in particular @xmath91 , are subject to various advantages over the protocol @xmath63 using entanglement .",
    "firstly , @xmath63 requires the preparation and distribution of @xmath56 two - qudit entangled states whereas in @xmath91 and @xmath112 only the preparation of the uniform superposition is required .",
    "secondly , @xmath63 requires @xmath115 measurements , @xmath112 requires @xmath56 measurements , whereas @xmath91 requires only one single measurement independent of @xmath5 . in the highly realistic case of parties having non - ideal detectors with efficiency @xmath116 $ ]",
    ", it is sufficient that one single measurement fails in order for the success probability to drop to the vicinity of @xmath62 , which can be reproduced by guessing .",
    "the probability of all measurements succeeding in @xmath63 is @xmath117 and in @xmath112 it is @xmath118 , both rapidly decreasing as @xmath5 increases .",
    "however , using @xmath91 , the probability of successful detection is constantly @xmath119 .",

[ figure2 ] ) and with angle @xmath133 where @xmath134 for the protocol @xmath112 ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
