    "neutron capture processes on neutron - rich c- , n- and o - isotopes play an important role in astrophysical scenarios ranging from nucleosynthesis in the stellar helium and carbon burning stages to possibly inhomogeneous big bang models . to simulate the nucleosynthesis of light isotopes between",
    "carbon and neon a detailed understanding of the these neutron capture reactions is therefore essential .",
    "this paper intends to derive a consistent set of stellar neutron capture reaction rates for neutron - rich carbon , nitrogen and oxygen isotopes , based on the latest experimental and theoretical information .    in stellar helium core burning in massive red giant stars neutrons",
    "are abundantly produced via the @xmath0n(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3f(@xmath4 ) @xmath3o(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath5ne(@xmath1,n ) reaction sequence  @xcite . in the early helium core evolution @xmath0n and @xmath3o",
    "are initially depleted , while initiating the neutron production .",
    "the neutrons subsequently trigger the weak s - process component which leads to the production of intermediate mass nuclei around a=100 .",
    "neutrons , however , can also be captured on @xmath6c and @xmath7o which are abundantly produced in helium burning .    in the very last phase of helium core burning",
    ", the core expands and outer layers with high @xmath0n and @xmath3o abundances cause an increase in neutron production .",
    "neutron capture on these isotopes however may act as neutron poison and may also change the light isotope abundances .",
    "this depends critically on the reaction cross section in the energy range between 25 and 200kev .",
    "he - shell burning in low mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars has been proposed as the site for the main component of the s - process @xcite .",
    "neutron production is triggered in the he - burning shell by the @xmath8c(@xmath1,n ) reaction on @xmath8c being ingested by convective processes during the thermal pulses .",
    "it has been suggested that neutron induced processes on the initial and the additionally ingested carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen abundances may have considerable influence on light isotope nucleosynthesis in the thermal pulse  @xcite .",
    "recent stellar model calculations @xcite indicate that the reaction cross sections for the neutron capture processes need to be known in the energy range between 5kev and 30kev .    in the framework of inhomogeneous big bang models ( ims )",
    "high neutron flux induces primordial nucleosynthesis which bridges the mass 5 and mass 8 gap  @xcite .",
    "subsequent neutron capture processes on neutron - rich carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen isotopes may bypass the long - lived @xmath0c and trigger a primordial r - process  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency for the production of heavy elements in such a scenario depends sensitively on the respective neutron capture rates for these light isotopes .",
    "therefore the neutron capture cross sections have to be determined over a wide energy range up to 1.0mev .    over the last few years considerable effort has been made to determine the neutron capture reaction rates for the c- , n- , and o - isotopes experimentally as well as theoretically . with the present paper we attempt to summarize the experimentally determined neutron capture rates .",
    "we present new calculations in the framework of a hybrid compound nucleus and direct capture model and compare the results with the experimental data as well as with previous calculations using the direct capture model @xcite and the statistical hauser - feshbach model @xcite .",
    "the same models were used to determine in addition neutron capture reaction rates on @xmath9-unstable neutron - rich c- , n- , and o - isotopes .    in the following sect .  2 we will present the formalism used in calculating the reaction cross sections and reaction rates . we also discuss the experimental and theoretical input parameters for the calculations of the different cross sections and reaction rates . in sect .",
    "3 the results of our calculations are compared with previous predictions both with a direct capture and a hauser - feshbach model . if available we also compare our results with experimental data . finally , in the last section the results are summarized and discussed .",
    "the cross section for neutron capture processes is dominated by the non - resonant direct capture ( dc ) process and by contributions from single resonances which correspond to neutron unbound states in the compound nucleus ( cn ) . for calculating the different reaction contributions we used a simple hybrid model : the non - resonant contributions were determined by using a direct capture model ,",
    "the resonant contributions were based on determining the resonant breit - wigner cross section . in the case of broad resonances interference terms have to be taken into account . to determine the neutron capture cross sections on the @xmath10-unstable nuclei the necessary input parameter for the calculations ( masses , q - values , spin - parity assignments of bound states and resonances , excitation energies , spectroscopic factors , density distributions , scattering data ) were taken from experimental data . when no experimental data were available we used theoretical values , mainly derived from the shell model ( see below ) .    the total reaction rate is given by @xmath11 where the three terms represent the resonant contribution @xmath12 , the non - resonant contribution @xmath13 and the interferences @xmath14 .",

    "another important quantity is the maxwellian averaged cross section .",

    "the resonance strength @xmath31 for a resonance is given by @xmath36 the resonance strength has to be determined experimentally by low energy neutron capture measurements or has to be derived from the calculated partial widths .",

    "are predominantly determined by s - wave and p - wave contributions .",
    "if the q - value of the neutron capture reaction is clearly higher than the neutron energy the cross section for s - wave neutron capture follows the @xmath41 law .",
    "then the reaction rate is constant over the entire temperature range @xcite .",
    "the s - wave contribution to the reaction rate can then be directly determined from the thermal cross section @xmath42 , @xmath43 the cross section for p - wave contributions is approximately proportional to the relative velocity @xmath44 , the reaction rate is therefore proportional to the temperature @xcite and can be expressed by @xmath45 for low q - values the simple @xmath41- and @xmath44-law do not apply anymore .",

    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) @xmath46 while a transition p@xmath47s has the energy dependence @xmath48 if @xmath49 the conventional energy dependence is recovered . from the above equations we obtain contributions to the reaction rate which are not constant ( for s - wave capture ) or proportional to @xmath34 ( for p - wave capture ) in the case of small q - values .",
    "several transitions considered in this work have q - values less than 1mev ( e.g. , all transitions of the reaction @xmath7c(n,@xmath2)@xmath50c ) . for these cases",
    "the neutrons are very loosely bound and the bound state wave functions reach out very far .",
    "we therefore call the deviations from the conventional energy dependence halo effects .    in the reaction @xmath8c(n,@xmath2)@xmath0c",
    "we also have a contribution from an incoming d - wave . the energy dependence of d - wave capture",

    "the halo effects and the d - wave contributions can be fitted as @xmath53 with only a small error .",
    "if the widths of the resonances are broad an interference term has to be added .",

    "the interference can be neglected , because either the resonance is too narrow , the resonance energy is too high or the angular momentum of the incoming partial waves of the resonant and direct capture contribution differ .    with this additional term in the cross section we have to add new terms to the reaction rate .",

    "for example , the spectroscopic factors necessary for calculating a(n,@xmath2)b can be extracted from the reaction a(d , p)b .",
    "the @xmath2-widths can be extracted from reduced electromagnetic transition strengths . for unstable nuclei",

    "we combine the latest experimental information based on cross section measurements ( for stable target nuclei ) and on indirect measurements of transfer , charge exchange and decay processes ( for radioactive target nuclei ) with theoretical direct capture and shell model calculations to derive reliable rates for neutron capture on neutron - rich c- , n- , and o - isotopes .",
    "thus , the reaction rates provided here contain the latest information available and should replace the corresponding rates given in previous compilations  @xcite .",
