    "numerous general mathematical theories have been formulated to model hysteretic behavior in a variety of systems , including the preisach model @xcite and systems of differential equations that display discontinuous bifurcations @xcite .",
    "hysteresis in thermodynamic systems is often due to the presence of a first - order phase transition , which is the source of strong nonlinearity in the system .",
    "these details of the nonlinear response can , however , be quite different in different systems and even in different parameter regimes for the same system .",
    "the details must be carefully considered in order to accurately predict such aspects of the hysteretic response as its dependence on the frequency , amplitude , and waveform of the oscillating force . here",
    "we present a study of hysteresis in a particular model system which incorporates both spatial degrees of freedom and thermal fluctuations and which has a first - order equilibrium phase transition .",
    "the system response in the parameter regime studied in this paper is _ self - averaging _ and may be described by the kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) theory of metastable decay @xcite .    specifically , we consider hysteresis in a spin-@xmath0 , nearest - neighbor , kinetic ising ferromagnet on a two - dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , which is subject to a sinusoidally oscillating field . for convenience , and because many of the experimental measurements of hysteresis involve magnetic systems , we use the customary magnetic language in which the order parameter is the dimensionless magnetization per site , @xmath9 $ ] , and the force is the magnetic field @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite differs from most past theoretical and numerical studies of hysteresis in two important ways .",
    "first , mean - field models do not take into account thermal noise and spatial variations in the order parameter , thus ignoring fluctuations which may be important in real materials .",

    "here we provide a full account of these results , which we briefly reported in ref .",
    "this transition can be intuitively understood as a competition between two time scales : the period of the external field , @xmath37 , and the average lifetime of the metastable phase , @xmath38 , defined as the first - passage time to a magnetization of zero following an instantaneous field reversal from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",

    "there is a critical frequency at which @xmath45 appears to become singular in the infinite - system limit .",
    "we emphasize that the dpt is a nonequilibrium phase transition and that the probability distribution of the system magnetization which characterizes the two phases never relaxes into a stationary state .",
    "however , the `` filtered '' time series of @xmath31 for successive field periods is a stationary stochastic process . to avoid confusion",
    "we establish the following terminology . by the term `` dynamic phase '' we mean one of the qualitatively different system responses separated by the dpt . in contrast , the term `` phase '' by itself refers in the conventional way to a uniform thermodynamic phase .",

    "the first peak in the spectrum corresponds to @xmath94 , the frequency of the external field .",

    "the power @xmath118 contained in the @xmath119th component of the fourier series for a pure square wave is @xmath120 ^ 4/(n \\pi)^{2}$ ] , which decays as @xmath121 and vanishes for even @xmath119 .",

    "[ fig_psdmd ] correspond to much larger frequencies in units of @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the time scales characterizing the peaks and the thermal noise regions are not as well separated as for the sd regime , so the two regions overlap .",

    "the low - frequency region comprises the portion of each spectrum between the first peak and the lowest resolved frequency .",
    "the psd in this region exhibits a strong dependence on the frequency of the field .",

    "@xmath123 , the overall slope in the low - frequency region is close to @xmath124 .",
    "this suggests that the long - time correlations are exponential with a very large correlation time @xcite .",
    "the turnover in the corresponding lorentzian psd is not observable because of the lack of low - frequency resolution due to the finite length of the time series . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the low - frequency region of the psd also suggests a lorentzian , again with a correlation time that is difficult to estimate due to the poor low - frequency resolution . for @xmath108 ,",

    "this is easily understood since the variance of the magnetization in equilibrium should be proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the frequency dependence of both the hysteresis - loop areas and the correlation rely on numerically solving an expression for @xmath11 during a single field period .",

    "the distributions in fig .",

    "we assume that the mean of the order parameter scales with @xmath16 and define the scaling variable @xmath264 .",
    "hence , the scaled probability density for @xmath214 is given by @xmath265 where the prefactor @xmath266 ensures conservation of probability .",
    "figure [ fig_scaledqdis_md ] shows this scaled probability density .",
    "the peak positions scale fairly well , the peak heights less so .",
    "this could be due to the following reasons",
    ". the frequency might be sufficiently far from the transition that single - parameter scaling is not adequate , and there might be corrections to the finite - size scaling that are large for these relatively small system sizes .",
    "also , the lack of scaling for the peak heights could be due to the asymmetry in @xmath267 near the transition .    the results in this section clearly show that the statistical properties of the order parameter @xmath31 exhibit finite - size scaling , and that scaling techniques developed for estimating the critical exponents for second - order phase transitions in equilibrium systems apparently can be successfully applied to estimate the exponents associated with the dynamic phase transition .",
    "while these scaling relations are concerned with @xmath214 , it is worth mentioning that one may also measure the fluctuations in the other two quantities measured , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig_suscepab_md ] shows the fluctuations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , defined in analogy to the order - parameter fluctuation @xmath216 .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath32 seem to show slight finite - size effects , as the peak positions appear to be approaching @xmath268 with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "one might speculate that this could indicate that @xmath32 is coupled to energy fluctuations which are logarithmically divergent as they are for the two - dimensional ising model in equilibrium .",

    "the mechanism by which a metastable phase decays depends sensitively on the system size , the temperature , and the strength of the applied field . for large systems and moderately strong fields",
    ", the decay proceeds through the nucleation and growth of _ many _ droplets of overturned spins in different parts of the system .",
    "this regime has been termed the multi - droplet ( md ) regime . in this regime",
    "the magnetization response in static field is described by the kjma approximation ( avrami s law ) , which assumes the presence of many noninteracting , overlapping droplets .",
    "theoretical predictions by a generalization of the kjma approximation , in which a time - dependent nucleation rate and droplet interface velocity are used , agree well with simulations for quantities like the average hysteresis - loop area and correlation , especially at low driving frequencies .",
    "the time dependence is included in the theory by replacing the constant field @xmath14 by @xmath269 .",
    "this central idea provides the analytic framework for our theoretical descriptions of quantities measured from the mc simulations in the md regime .",
    "the theoretical calculations and the mc data agree very well , especially considering that only one adjustable parameter is needed , which was measured from a particular hysteresis simulation ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "all of the other constants used are either known from droplet theory or were measured for mc simulations of field reversal in kinetic ising models . to the best of our knowledge , the work reported here is the first which explicitly considers hysteresis for the ising model in the md regime .",
    "we compute the power spectral densities from the simulated time series and qualitatively explain various features of the spectra in the full frequency range from the lowest observable frequencies to the rapid fluctuations due to thermal noise . for low field frequencies ,",
    "the system is in the disordered dynamic phase , and the time series contain no large fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the psds are flat at frequencies below the fundamental peak at the frequency of the field .",
    "the significant power density in the low - frequency portion of the psds corresponds to the long - time behavior in the filtered time series for @xmath31 . for high field frequencies ,",
    "the system is in the ordered dynamic phase , and the time series display long - time behavior as the system switches between thermodynamic phases .",
    "this corresponds to large power density in the low - frequency portion of the psds .",
    "near the dynamic phase transition the psds exhibit similar behavior in the low - frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "due to insufficiently long time series we are unable to resolve any quantitative difference between these psds and those in the ordered dynamic phase region .",
    "we also calculate the hysteresis - loop area @xmath32 and the correlation @xmath33 for a wide range of frequencies . because of its role as a measure of the energy dissipation in the system",
    ", @xmath32 is a quantity of particular experimental significance .",
    "for all frequencies , the loop - area and correlation distributions are unimodal due to the almost deterministic magnetization response in the md regime .",
    "our theoretical predictions for the frequency dependence of @xmath148 and @xmath149 use the time - dependent extension of avrami s law to calculate @xmath11 , from which the loop area and correlation are calculated explicitly .",
    "the assumption is that the @xmath11 values calculated for a _ single _ period accurately describe the average values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 over a long simulation time series .",
    "this assumption should be expected to break down most significantly for frequencies near the dynamic phase transition , where the fluctuations in the magnetization response are largest .",
    "this is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig_amean_md ] and  [ fig_bmean_md ] , where the least satisfactory agreement between the theory and the mc data occurs for frequencies near the dynamic phase transition . for the low - frequency regime",
    "we obtain an analytic expression for @xmath148 .",
    "our theoretical calculation agrees well with our mc results and predicts an _ extremely _ slow crossover to a logarithmic dependence of the loop area on @xmath270 .",
    "the switching dynamics is dominated by nucleation and indicates no overall power - law dependence for the loop area on field amplitude and/or frequency , in contrast to what has been claimed in other simulational and experimental studies .",
    "we emphasize that numerical analysis of data generated by our analytic solution , even over two or three frequency decades , could easily lead to the conclusion that the data were taken from a power law .",
    "our simulations reveal that for frequencies _ far _ higher than those at which the asymptotic logarithmic dependence would be observable , a system - size dependent crossover from md to sd behavior occurs .",
    "this novel frequency dependence for @xmath32 is a consequence of the field dependence of the sd and md decay mechanisms . as the frequency of the field becomes sufficiently small , the system is subject to fields smaller than @xmath271 for a sufficiently long time so that sd decay usually occurs before the field becomes large enough for md decay to happen .",
    "the period - averaged magnetization @xmath31 has been proposed as an order parameter associated with the dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) in kinetic ising models .",
    "the dpt is a _ nonequilibrium _",
    "phase transition which occurs due to an explicit time - dependence in the hamiltonian , rather than the dynamical rules governing the system .",
    "the probability densities that we obtain for @xmath31 clearly show that the system changes from an ordered dynamic phase with nonzero @xmath215 to a disordered dynamic phase with @xmath109 as the field moves from high to low frequencies . to distinguish this frequency - dependent change in @xmath215 as a true second - order phase transition rather than merely a simple bifurcation",
    ", we measure the finite - size effects at the dpt and apply finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques analogous to those used to measure the critical exponents which characterize _ equilibrium _ second - order transitions .",
    "the measured exponents ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) are close to both the two - dimensional ising and random percolation values , and they represent strong evidence that hyperscaling is obeyed . our success in applying fss techniques borrowed from the theory of equilibrium second - order phase transitions to this nonstationary nonequilibrium problem suggests the possibility of mapping other suitably defined quantities for this system to thermodynamic entities , such as the field conjugate to the order parameter , the specific heat , and the correlation length . such a nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory for steady states as been attempted by paniconi and oono @xcite .    in future work",
    "we plan to analyze longer simulations on larger system sizes to more accurately determine the values of the exponents and the location of the dpt .",
    "this includes measuring the possible finite - size effects in the probability distributions of the energy @xcite , which might be related to the finite - size effects seen in the fluctuations in @xmath32 .",
    "if a fluctuation - dissipation theorem could be shown for this system , the order - parameter and energy fluctuations could be related to a nonequilibrium susceptibility and specific heat respectively .",
    "another important question left to future study is if and to what extent the exponents depend on the temperature and field amplitude .",
    "while the critical frequency will almost certainly depend on amplitude and temperature , the critical exponents would most likely not if the dpt indeed represents a new `` dynamic universality class . ''",
    "finally , we note that the quantities that we have analyzed numerically could all be measured in experiments on hysteresis in a variety of systems and analyzed by methods essentially identical to our analysis of the mc data .",
