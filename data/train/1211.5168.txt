    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) events are rare in the standard model ( sm ) both in the quark and the lepton sectors .",
    "these processes can be affected by new physics ( np ) .",
    "fcnc involving the third family quark and leptons are interesting as their larger masses make them more susceptible to new physics effects in various extensions of the sm . as an example , in certain versions of the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) the couplings of the new higgs bosons are proportional to the masses and so new physics effects are more pronounced for the heavier generations . moreover , the constraints on new physics involving , specially the third generation leptons and quarks , are somewhat weaker allowing for larger new physics effects . hence , in the down quark sector there is intense interest in the search for np in fcnc @xmath8 and @xmath9 transitions in @xmath10 mixing , @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays .",
    "many measurements in the @xmath13 sector have constrained np effects though slight discrepancies from sm predictions still remain in several decays @xcite . in the up quark sector",
    "one can look for np is the processes @xmath14 transitions @xcite .    in the lepton sector",
    "fcnc decays are severely suppressed and lepton number for each family is conserved in the sm .",
    "therefore , fcnc effects and lepton flavor violation in this sector are sensitive probes of np .",
    "the presence of neutrino masses and mixing suggest np in the lepton sector which in turn could enhance fcnc effects and lepton flavor violation .",
    "it is interesting that measurements involving the the tau lepton show some discrepancies from sm expectations",
    ". the branching ratio of @xmath15 shows some tension with the sm predictions @xcite though more recent measurement are consistent with the sm @xcite .",
    "this could indicate np @xcite , possibly coming from an extended scalar or gauge sector .",
    "there is also a seeming violation of universality in the tau lepton coupling to the @xmath16 suggested by the lep ii data which could indicate new physics associated with the third generation lepton martingon .",
    "more recently , the babar collaboration with their full data sample of an integrated luminosity 426 fb@xmath17 has reported the measurements of the quantities @xcite @xmath18 the sm predictions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 are : 2012xj , fajfer:2012vx , sakaki:2012 ft @xmath21 which deviate from the babar measurements by 2@xmath22 and 2.7@xmath22 respectively .",
    "the babar collaboration themselves reported a 3.4@xmath22 deviation from sm when the two measurements of eq .",
    "[ babarnew ] are taken together .",
    "this result , if confirmed , could indicate np involving new charged scalar or vector boson states @xcite .",
    "models with new charged scalars or charged vector bosons also include neutral particles that can cause fcnc effects .    in this paper we will focus on the process @xmath23 .",
    "this involves two fcnc interactions- one in the quark and one in the lepton sector .",
    "typically one believes that this process will be very small even with new physics and in many np models this is indeed true .",
    "this is because in these np models this fcnc process arises in loops and is suppressed . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the decay @xmath24 and make predictions for its rate .",
    "this decay was considered in earlier papers in various extensions of the sm @xcite . in this work",
    "we will calculate the process in two scenarios representing two extension of the sm .    in the first scenario we will consider this process mediated by a scalar which we will call @xmath25 in a model with an extended higgs sector . in this model",
    "we will assume that there are scalar particles that have fcnc couplings and can mediate the decay @xmath26 .",
    "we will identify the lowest mass such state with the @xmath25 particle .",
    "it is tue that in this model there can be other heavier neutral states that can also mediate the decay @xmath26 .",
    "when multiple scalar states contribute to the decay there will be more parameters that can not be all constrained from the data resulting in loss of predictive power . to regain some predictive power",
    ", our assumption will be that that the dominant contribution to the decay comes from the lowest lying state @xmath25 .",
    "we expect that the contributions to the decay from the higher mass states will in general not lower our estimated branching ratios significantly unless there are strong cancellations among the various amplitudes .",
    "we will assume that there are no strong cancellations among the various contributions .",
    "we will identify @xmath25 with the newly discovered particle , with mass @xmath1 gev , observed at lhc @xcite with supporting evidence for its existence from fermilab @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath27 is generated at tree level due to the presence of @xmath28 and @xmath29 couplings .",
    "the coupling @xmath30 can be constrained by @xmath10 mixing while the @xmath29 couplings can be constrained from rare @xmath31 decays . recently in ref .",
    "@xcite these coupling were considered and it was noticed that the @xmath32 coupling could be of similar size as the sm higgs to @xmath33 coupling .",
    "since @xmath34 are pseudoscalars , the flavor changing coupling of @xmath25 to the @xmath34 mesons must contain a pseudoscalar component of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the spin parity of the @xmath25 particle is not yet known though various strategies that allow for the spin and parity determination are being actively pursued @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath37 can be significant and can potentially be observed at lhcb .",
    "generally , final states with @xmath31 leptons are difficult to measure at lhcb , however because of an associated @xmath38 in the final state this process may be somewhat easier to observe than @xmath39 .",
    "we would like to point that the decay can also be mediated through the exchange of a spin one particle at tree level .",
    "since we will be identifying the mediator with the newly discovered state at lhc we will not consider the mediator to be a spin one particle .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ brblilj ] the matrix elements with scalar currents , associated with a scalar mediator , are enhanced relative to vector currents associated with a spin one mediator .    in the second scenarios",
    "we will consider a popular extension of the sm- the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) . here",
    "the fcnc couplings arise via loops and so our expectation is that the branching ratio for @xmath24 will be tiny .",
    "the main point here is that if this process were to be observed at the lhcb in the near future this would indicate the presence of a rather non - traditional np with appreciable level fcnc couplings in the lepton sector and possibly a light spin zero mediator .",

    "thus , one finds @xmath179 and @xmath180 where @xmath181 in this case , these co - efficients can be used in eq .",
    "[ brblilj ] to calculate the branching ratio for @xmath168 .",
    "we can estimate the typical prediction of susy models to the branching ration of the @xmath182 process . as usual",
    "one can easily show that the neutralino contribution is typically one or two order of magnitude less than the light chargino effect .",
    "therefore , here we will neglect the neutralino diagrams and focus on the dominate chargino contribution . as explicitly shown above the chargino amplitude",
    "depends on stops and tau - sneutrinos masses and mixing .",
    "therefore a light stop and light tau - sneutrinos may significantly enhance the chargino contribution to @xmath6 .    in mssm ,",
    "the stop mass matrix is given bym^2_= (    cc m_q^2 + m_t^2 + m_z^22(3 - 4 ^ 2_w ) & m_t(a_t- ) + m_t(a_t- ) & m_u^2 + m_t^2 + m_z^22 ^ 2_w    ) , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the low energy values of the soft susy breaking scalar masses .",
    "due to large off - diagonal elements , the diagonalization of the stop mass - squared matrix leads to the physical eigenstates with one light and one heavy stops .",
    "in addition , with no right - handed neutrinos in mssm the sneutrino mass matrix is given by m^2 _",
    "= m_l^2 + m_z^2 ^2 , where @xmath185 is the soft susy scalar masses of the sleptons .",
    "it is also a part of the left - left sector of the charged slepton mass - squared matrix .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the experimental limits of lepton flavor violations , like @xmath186 impose stingiest constraints on the off - diagonal elements of @xmath187 between the first and second generations , while the mixing between first or the second and third generations are much less constrained @xcite .    in fig .",
    "4 we present the @xmath188 as function of @xmath189 .",
    "we assume that the lightest and heaviest stop masses are of order 200 gev and @xmath190 gev respectively .",
    "we consider @xmath191 and take @xmath38 between 250 gev and 1 tev .",
    "the lightest sneutrino mass is assumed to be of order 200 gev and the sneutrino mixing parameters are of order @xmath192 . as can be seen from this figure ,",
    "the branching ratio @xmath188 can be enhanced up to @xmath193 for large @xmath189 and light charginos and sneutrinos .",
    "also if we have semi - degenerate masses for chargino , stops , and sneutrino , then a kind of a resonance in the branching ratio may be obtained ( as can be seen from the loop functions : @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) . in this case",
    "the branching ratio can reach @xmath196 , however , we think this is a fine tuning therefore we assume that the mass difference between these particles @xmath197 gev at least .",
    "from this analysis one can conclude that the typical susy predictions for this branching ratio of @xmath198 is of order @xmath199 .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in the second paper of ref.@xcite , it was emphasized that in the supersymmetric seesaw extensions of the sm , the two loop double penguin diagrams may be relevant at a very large @xmath189 ( of order 60 ) even with flavor universal slepton masses . in this case",
    ", it was shown that the double penguins mediated by higgs bosons may induce a branching ratio of order @xmath200 , which may give dominant results at very large @xmath189 and low @xmath201 .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the rare decay @xmath24 in two possible extensions of the sm .",
    "in particular , we considered the decay in a model with an extended higgs sector , where the decay is mediated by a light scalar which is identified with the recently observed state at lhc . in the second example , the one loop contribution to this process in mssm was computed .",
    "we found that in the former scenario the branching ratio @xmath202 can be as high as @xmath196 ( @xmath203 can be as high as @xmath204 ) , while in the later scenario the @xmath205 could be @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , one concludes that probing this lepton flavor violating process at the lhcb would be a significant hint for a non - traditional new physics beyond the sm with large fcnc couplings .",
