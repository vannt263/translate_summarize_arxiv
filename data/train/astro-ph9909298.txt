    "within the standard picture for galaxy formation , in which galaxies are thought to form out of the gas which dissipatively collapses within the potential wells provided by virialized dark halos ( white & rees 1978 ) , disk galaxies take a special place .",
    "their flatness and rotational support suggest a relatively smooth formation history without violent non - linear processes .",
    "the structure and dynamics of disk galaxies are thus expected to be strongly related to the properties of the dark halos in which they are embedded .",
    "this principle is in fact the key idea behind the standard model for disk formation which was set out by fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) , and which has since been extended upon by numerous investigators ( faber 1982 ; fall 1983 ; van der kruit 1987 ; dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; van den bosch 1998 ) . in this picture",
    ", the gas radiates its binding energy but retains its angular momentum , thus settling into a rotationally supported disk , the scale length of which is proportional to both the size and the angular momentum of the dark halo .",
    "understanding galaxy formation is intimately linked to understanding the origin of the fundamental scaling relations of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we use new semi - analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies to investigate the origin of the tully - fisher ( hereafter tf ) relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , which has the form @xmath2 or , in terms of a linear law in a log - log plane : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the absolute magnitude of the disk , and @xmath5 is called the slope of the relation . in the light of the strong coupling between disk and dark halo",
    "mentioned above , a scaling relation like this is central to theories of galaxy formation .",
    "understanding its origin can put constraints on theories of galaxy formation , and in particular on the detailed physics that cause the baryonic component of a dark halo to be transformed into a luminous galaxy . as such , any successful theory of ( disk ) galaxy formation should be able to explain the slope , zero - point , and small amount of scatter of this fundamental scaling relation .",
    "numerous studies in the past have addressed the origin of the tf relation . however , no consensus has been reached , and it is currently still under debate whether the origin of the tf relation is mainly governed by initial cosmological conditions ( e.g. , eisenstein & loeb 1996 ; avila - reese , firmani & hernndez 1998 ; firmani & avila - reese 1998a , b ) , or by the detailed processes governing star formation ( silk 1997 ; heavens & jiminez 1999 ) and/or feedback ( e.g. , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al .  1994 ; elizondo et al .",
    "1999 ; natarajan 1999 ) .",
    "one of the main reasons for this lack of consistency is the discordant use of luminosity and rotation measures in tf relations .",
    "the slope and scatter of the tf relation depend strongly on the photometric band used to measure the luminosities : values of @xmath6 increase from @xmath7 in the @xmath8-band to @xmath9 in the infrared ( e.g. , aaronson , huchra & mould 1979 ; visvanathan 1981 ; tully , mould & aaronson 1982 ; wyse 1982 ; pierce & tully 1988 ; gavazzi 1993 ; verheijen 1997 ) . for the rotation velocity a large number of different measures have been used : hi line widths from single - dish observations , velocities measured from h@xmath10 rotation curves , rotation velocities at a fixed number of disk scale lengths , maximum observed rotation velocities , rotation velocities at the last measured point , and the velocity of the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "all these different measures yield wildly different tf relations ( see courteau 1997 and verheijen 1997 for detailed discussions ) .",
    "therefore it is crucial that one extracts the same quantities from the models as the ones used in the empirical relation whose origin one seeks to explain .",
    "most previous studies have ignored the subtleties associated with these different measures , and allowed themselves the `` freedom '' to compare their model predictions with the best fitting tf relation available in the literature .",
    "the other reason why we still lack consensus on the origin of the tf relation regards the modeling techniques that have been used .",
    "several investigators have used numerical simulations ( e.g. , evrard , summers & davis 1994 ; navarro & white 1994 ; steinmetz & mller 1994 ; tissera , lambas & abadi 1997 ; domnguez - tenreiro , tissera & siz 1998 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ; elizondo et al .",
    "a general problem , however , is that the disks that form in these simulations have specific angular momenta that are more than an order of magnitude lower than those of observed disks .",
    "in addition , most of these simulations ignore star formation and feedback , making a direct comparison between simulated and observed disks a treacherous enterprise ( see evrard 1997 for a review ) .",
    "semi - analytical modeling ( sam ) of galaxy formation has been more successful ( white & frenk 1991 ; cole 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; lacey et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al .  1994 ; heyl et al .  1995 ;",
    "somerville & primack 1998 ) .",
    "despite reasonable success in reproducing certain tf relations , these models are hampered by several shortcomings ( see discussion in   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "more recently , avila - reese , firmani & hernndez ( 1998 ; hereafter afh98 ) and firmani & avila - reese ( 1998a , b ; hereafter fa98 ) presented new sams that focus only on the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "these models improve upon previous sams in several important ways . from a detailed comparison with",
    "observed tf relations , these authors conclude that the tf relation represents a fossil of the primordial density fluctuation field .",
    "in this paper we present new semi - analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "we improve upon previous studies by ( i ) making a well - motivated choice for the luminosity and velocity measures that define the tf relation whose origin we seek to understand , ( ii ) by extracting the same measures from the models , and ( iii ) by using new semi - analytical models that focus on the formation of disk galaxies and that alleviate several shortcomings of previous models .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate the prevailing mechanism that is responsible for the slope , zero - point and small amount of scatter of the tf relation .",
    "although our models are , in many ways , complementary to those of fa98 , we reach a different conclusion .",
    "one of the most detailed investigations of the empirical tf relation is that of verheijen ( 1997 , hereafter v97 ) , who obtained @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath0 band photometry , as well as detailed hi synthesis observations of a complete sample of ( bright ) spiral galaxies in the ursa major cluster ( see also tully et al .",
    "v97 made a detailed comparison of different tf relations using different photometric bands and different velocity measures .",
    "this study has yielded a number of important results : ( i ) the scatter in the tf relation is smallest when using the flat part of the hi rotation curve , @xmath13 , as velocity measure , ( ii ) when using the hi line widths , the tf relations become shallower and harbor a larger scatter , ( iii ) the results of sprayberry et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and zwaan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , that high surface brightness ( hsb ) and low surface brightness ( lsb ) spirals follow the same tf relation , are confirmed , ( iv ) both the scatter and the slope of the tf relation are extremely sensitive to selection criteria , and ( v ) the slope of the tf relation changes from @xmath14 in the @xmath8-band to @xmath15 in the @xmath0-band .    luminosities depend more strongly on extinction , stellar populations , star formation histories , and metallicities going towards bluer passbands .",
    "given the large uncertainties associated with stellar population models and with a proper treatment of extinction by dust , and since the tf relation is fundamentally a dynamical law , the most natural passbands to use are those in the near - infrared in which luminosity is most directly related to the luminous mass ( see e.g. , gavazzi 1993 ; gavazzi , pierini & boselli 1996 ) . if we further limit ourselves to tf relations that are not based on hi line widths , since these are particularly hard to interpret in terms of fundamental parameters of the galaxy ( e.g. , haynes et al .",
    "1999 ) , the available data becomes actually very limited .",
    "the only tf relation that is based on full near - infrared imaging ( rather than aperture photometry ) and has velocity measures that are derived from full hi rotation curves , is the @xmath0-band tf relation of v97 : @xmath16 here @xmath13 is the measured rotation velocity at the flat part of the hi rotation curve and @xmath17 .",
    "magnitudes have been converted to @xmath18 adopting a distance to the ursa major cluster of 15.5 mpc , which corresponds to @xmath19 ( pierce & tully 1988 , 1992 ) . in what follows",
    "we consider equation  ( [ tffund ] ) the ` fundamental ' tf relation whose origin we seek to understand .",
    "in order to investigate whether the origin of the tf relation is mainly related to cosmological initial conditions , or to details regarding the processes associated with star formation and/or supernovae feedback , we construct new semi - analytical models that focus on the near - infrared properties of disk galaxies only . we incorporate a number of improvements over previous sams , all of which ( except for fa98 ) assumed all dark halos to have the same specific angular momentum . since the angular momentum sets , to a large degree , the surface density of the disk , and since star formation is a strong function of surface density ( see   [ sec : sf ] ) , a realistic spread in halo specific angular momenta yields a spread in luminosities for galaxies forming in halos of the same mass .",
    "this is especially important when investigating for example the scatter in the tf relation . also , we take adiabatic contraction into account ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; flores et al .",
    "1993 ) and consider the more realistic universal halo density profiles , rather than singular isothermal spheres , which have been found to poorly fit the actual density profiles of dark halos in @xmath20-body simulations ( e.g. , frenk et al .  1988 ; efstathiou et al .  1988 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ; tormen , bouchet & white 1997 ) .",
    "we use a star formation recipe that is different from previous sams , and mimic observations of the actual rotation curve of the galaxy , rather than to simply assume that the observed rotation velocity is equal to the circular velocity at the halo s virial radius . as we show below , these latter two modifications prove to be of crucial importance .",
    "the dynamical fragility of disks implies that their mass aggregation histories can not have been too violent ( e.g. , tth & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "we therefore refrain from calculating complete merger histories of the dark halos .",
    "the study by navarro et al .  ( 1997 ) has shown that virialized dark halos are well described by a universal density profile , whose properties can be calculated from the press - schechter formalism . in a recent study , jing ( 1999 )",
    "has shown that halos with significant amounts of substructure can deviate significantly from this universal density profile .",
    "however , these halos are unlikely to yield disk galaxies , and the universal density profiles can thus be used to describe the end - state of the mass aggregation histories of halos surrounding spiral galaxies ( see also afh98 ) .    as shown by baugh , cole & frenk ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the merging histories and star formation histories are well coupled . ignoring ( small ) mergers",
    "therefore mainly reflects on the details regarding the star formation histories .",
    "since we focus on the near - infrared properties , we are insensitive to such details , given the fact that mass - to - light ratios in the near - infrared depend only very weakly on age and/or metallicity ( see   [ sec : stelpop ] below ) .",
    "furthermore , the quiet mass aggregation histories of disk galaxies implies smooth star formation histories with little scatter ( baugh et al .",
    "therefore , in the sams presented here we do not follow the detailed _ time - resolved _ formation of disk galaxies , but limit ourselves to modeling the _ time - integrated _ properties .",
    "virialized dark halos can be quantified by a mass , @xmath21 , a radius , @xmath22 , and an angular momentum , @xmath23 , originating from cosmological torques ( e.g. , hoyle 1953 ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the radius inside of which the average density of the system is 200 times the critical density of the universe , and @xmath21 is simply the total mass inside @xmath22 . in a series of papers",
    "navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) showed that virialized dark halos have universal equilibrium density profiles , independent of mass or cosmology , which can be well fit by @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 the concentration parameter , and @xmath27 a scale radius . given the mass @xmath21 and the specific cosmology , the concentration parameter @xmath28 can be calculated using the procedure outlined in the appendix of navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in what follows",
    "we only consider spherical halos , and we refer to halos with the density profile of equation  ( [ nfwprof ] ) as nfw halos .",
    "the angular momentum of the halo is quantified by the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath29 , defined by @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the halo s total energy .",
    "several studies , both analytical and numerical , have shown that the distribution of spin angular momenta of collapsed dark matter halos is well approximated by a log - normal distribution : @xmath32 ( e.g. , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; ryden 1988 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; warren et al .  1992 ) .",
    "we consider a distribution that peaks around @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the @xmath20-body results of warren et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and virtually independent of cosmology ( e.g. , lemson & kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "once the halo properties are known , we can determine the global properties of the disks that form inside them .",
    "the virialization of the halo heats the baryonic matter to the virial temperature . as the baryons start to cool they loose their pressure support and settle in a disk .",
    "we follow fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) and assume that the specific angular momentum of the baryonic material is conserved .",
    "we further assume that the disk that forms has an exponential surface density profile .",
    "the scale - length of the disk is proportional to @xmath29 and @xmath22 , and can be calculated using equation  ( 28 ) in mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "self - gravitating disks tend to be unstable against global instabilities such as bar formation .",
    "we use the stability criterion of christodoulou , shlosman & tohline ( 1995 ) , according to which disks are stable if they obey @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the characteristic circular velocities of the disk and the composite disk - bulge - halo system , respectively .

    "we set @xmath41 throughout , as suggested for gaseous disks ( christodoulou et al .",
    "we have tested that none of our results depend significantly on the value of this parameter .",
    "we follow the approach of van den bosch ( 1998 , 1999 ) and assume that a gaseous disk which is unstable according to criterion  ( [ stabalpha ] ) transforms part of its disk material into a bulge component in a self - regulating fashion , such that the final disk is marginally stable ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) .",
    "we describe the bulge by a sphere with a hernquist density profile : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a scale length ( hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "andredakis , peletier & balcells ( 1995 ) have shown that the effective radius @xmath45 ( defined as the radius encircling half of the projected light ) is directly related to the total luminosity of the bulge by the empirical relation @xmath46 if we now use @xmath47 , in good agreement with the average value for bulges ( peletier & balcells 1997 ) , and @xmath48 ( hernquist 1990 ) , we obtain @xmath49 which we use to set the scale length of the bulges in our models .",
    "our results do not depend on this simple scaling assumption , in practice .",
    "the main parameter for the bulge is its total mass ; changes in its actual density distribution are only a second - order effect , and do not influence our results .      since the @xmath0-band mass - to - light ratio depends only weakly on the metallicity and age of a stellar population ( see   [ sec : stelpop ] ) , and since integrated star formation histories of disk galaxies are not expected to exhibit strong variety , the main parameter of interest is the fraction of the gas that is converted into stars over the lifetime of the galaxy .    in a seminal paper kennicutt ( 1989 )",
    "showed that star formation is abruptly suppressed below a critical surface density , which is associated with the onset of large - scale gravitational instabilities , and which can be modeled by a simple toomre disc stability criterion : @xmath50 ( toomre 1964 ) . here",

    "what remains is to quantify the fraction , @xmath62 , of this eligible mass that is actually turned into stars over the age of the galaxy .",

    "the total @xmath0-band luminosity of the disk - bulge system then follows from @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar mass .",
    "the dominant source of feedback that can keep gas out of the disk is provided by supernovae ( sn ) .",
    "a mass @xmath75 of stars produces a total amount of energy by sn equal to @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the energy produced by one sn , and @xmath78 is the number of sn expected per solar mass of stars formed . throughout",

    ", we assume that this amount of energy can prevent a mass @xmath80 from ending up in the final disk - bulge system , either by means of completely expelling the gas from the halo , or by keeping gas in the halo at the virial temperature , thus preventing its collapse to the disk .",
    "taking account of the escape velocity of the halo , and requiring energy balance , one obtains @xmath81 ( cf .",

    "such small values are clearly inconsistent with the other constraints on @xmath147 , and we thus conclude that the tf zero - point can be added to a long list of observations that rule against a scdm universe .",
    "flat universes with @xmath163 are far more successful .",
    "this owes in large to the fact that the universal baryon fraction increases with decreasing @xmath145 .",
    "the values of @xmath164 found in our models depend on the density profiles of the dark halos , and are thus model dependent .",
    "although the exact density profiles in the central regions of dark matter halos are still under debate ( e.g. , moore et al .",

    "1998 ) , our estimates of @xmath167 are too low , and our limits on @xmath147 conservative .",
    "the result that the scdm cosmology yields galaxies that are too faint for their rotation velocities has already been pointed out by numerous previous studies . however , the analysis presented here is very much different , and yields important new results .",
    "already the very first applications of semi - analytical modeling revealed problems with the normalization of the tf relation ( cole 1991 ; white & frenk 1991 ; lacey & silk 1991 ; lacey et al .  1993 ; kauffmann et al .",

    "first of all , somerville & primack used a baryon density that is @xmath170 times the value adopted here .",

    "we have shown that a proper treatment of the different velocities is a crucial aspect of any attempt to try and comprehend ( the origin of ) the tf relation .",
    "in particular , from equation  ( [ constraint ] ) it is immediately apparent that had we directly associated @xmath171 with the rotation measure @xmath118 we would not have been able to rule against scdm .",
    "in addition to the sams , several studies based on numerical simulations have encountered similar problems with the normalization of the tf relation , e.g. , steinmetz & navarro ( 1999 ) and elizondo et al .  ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors suggest that the angular momentum catastrophe and declining star formation rates , respectively , are likely to be the cause for this discrepancy .",
    "the analysis presented here , however , shows that the problem is more fundamental than that .",
    "simple dynamical arguments predict a tf relation with a slope of @xmath125 , very different from the observed value of @xmath15 . from equation  ( [ tfpred ] )",
    "it is immediately clear that one can `` tilt '' the tf relation to the observed slope by satisfying the condition @xmath172 each of the three parameters on the left side of this equation represents a different class of physics : the galaxy formation efficiency , @xmath91 , is determined mainly by processes related to feedback , the mass - to - light ratio @xmath131 is related to details regarding the star - formation and stellar populations , and @xmath173 is related to the density of the dark halo , which in turn reflects cosmological initial conditions .",
    "here we investigate which of these processes is most important in tilting the tf relation towards its observed slope .",
    "based on the discussion in the previous  , we limit ourselves here to our fiducial @xmath174cdm3 cosmology ( see table  [ tab : cosmo ] ) .      the mass - to - light ratio @xmath131 in equation  ( [ condition ] ) is given by equation  ( [ mtols ] ) .",

    "since @xmath173 depends only very weakly on @xmath171 and @xmath111 we thus obtain a tf relation with a slope of @xmath125 .",
    "we do not consider a value of @xmath180 physical , but merely show the results of this model for comparison .",
    "setting @xmath51 to its fiducial value of @xmath170 , @xmath131 is found to decrease with increasing mass .",
    "this results in a significantly steeper tf relation with @xmath181 , and suggests that a further decrease of @xmath51 might actually yield a tf relation with @xmath182 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath183 we obtain @xmath184 , consistent with the observations within the error - bars .",
    "besides influencing the slope of the tf relation , @xmath51 also affects the amount of scatter . for values of @xmath185",
    "we can obtain even steeper tf relations , but at the cost of introducing unacceptable levels of scatter .",
    "the origin of this scatter is discussed in detail in ",
    "[ sec : scatter ] .",
    "we also examined the influence of changing the star formation parameters @xmath177 and @xmath176 ( such as to obtain @xmath186 ) while setting @xmath51 to its fiducial value of @xmath170 . in each case , we find that the schmidt law causes @xmath187 to decrease with increasing mass , resulting in a tf relation that is shallower than for model l1 .",
    "in addition , reducing @xmath62 tends to increase the scatter .",
    "next we experiment with a mass dependence of the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath74 . rather than adopting @xmath188",

    "stellar population models suggest that such a large spread in @xmath134 can not be due to variations in ages and/or metallicities , but it might reflect systematic variations of the imf with galaxy mass ( see e.g. , maraston 1998a ) . however , there is no observational support for such a variation .",
    "furthermore , if low mass systems have considerably higher @xmath0-band mass - to - light ratios than the more massive systems , this effect would be much stronger in bluer passbands .",
    "one would thus predict a tf relation in the @xmath8-band with @xmath194 , in clear contradiction with observations . we therefore consider a systematic variation of @xmath74 with mass an unlikely explanation for the steepness of the observed @xmath0-band tf relation .",
    "the ratio @xmath173 in equation  ( [ condition ] ) depends on the concentration @xmath28 of the dark halo , which is set by the halo s collapse redshift @xmath195 .",

    "this is significantly shallower than for cdm ( for which @xmath204 lies between @xmath205 and @xmath206 for systems with @xmath207 ) , and therefore implies a cosmology with more power on small scales as compared to cdm .",

    "; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the slope of the observed tf relation does not reflect cosmological initial conditions , in clear contrast to the results of afh98 .",

    "the empirical relations used by afh98 have slopes of @xmath208 and are based on hi line widths and @xmath209-band aperture photometry .",
    "subtle effects can cause non - linearities between aperture luminosities and total luminosities , which is not taken into account in the modeling of afh98 .",
    "in addition , hi linewidths are difficult to interpret in terms of fundamental parameters of the galaxy ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) . the @xmath0-band tf relation",
    "used to constrain our models is based on total luminosities derived from ccd imaging , and on rotation measures derived from the complete hi rotation curves .",
    "we extract the same measures from our model galaxies ensuring a fair comparison between models and observations .",
    "we therefore feel confident that we can rule out initial cosmological conditions as the primary cause for the observed slope of the tf relation ( at least for a cdm power spectrum ) .      having ruled out stellar populations and cosmological initial conditions , we finally resort to sn feedback to try and obtain a tf relation as steep as observed .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : fb ] plots the tf relation of model l5 , for which we have tuned the feedback parameters by fitting the empirical @xmath0-band tf relation ( see table  [ tab : param ] for the parameters ) .",
    "the model fits the empirical tf relation of v97 extremely well .",

    "we require @xmath226 percent of all the sn energy to prevent on the order of 80 to 95 percent of the baryons from settling in the disk / bulge system .",
    "it seems unlikely that the combined effect of sne and stellar winds can be so efficient ( i.e. , see mac low & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "we can lower the feedback efficiencies while still fitting the tf relation by lowering the star formation efficiency @xmath177 ( such that @xmath227 ) .",
    "in fact , we find a considerable amount of freedom in the parameters describing sn feedback and star formation to obtain good fits to the empirical tf relation .",
    "in general , however , one requires either a higher feedback efficiency , or a lower star formation efficiency than for the @xmath174cdm3 cosmology .",
    "the models in the previous sections contain two sources of scatter in the tf relations : the spread in halo spin parameters , @xmath228 , and the spread in inclination angles , which we quantify by @xmath229 .    for a halo of a given mass ,",
    "a non - zero @xmath228 yields a spread in both the magnitudes and rotation velocities of disks .",
    "lower values of @xmath29 yield more compact disks with a larger fraction of their mass eligible for star formation ( i.e. , galaxies are relatively bright ) .",
    "in addition , the compactness of the disk induces , because of the adiabatic contraction , a more strongly concentrated halo , and therefore a relatively high value of @xmath159 . model l0 ( for which @xmath180 ) in figure  [ fig : slope ] depicts a large amount of scatter .",
    "its origin is illustrated in the small inset in figure  [ fig : slope ] , which shows the `` tf relation '' for model galaxies with the same mass , but different spin parameters . because of the high value of @xmath51 , the critical density for star formation is relatively low .",
    "this implies that the radius @xmath61 where star formation is truncated occurs at relatively large radii of @xmath230 , where the growing curve of the cumulative disk mass is very flat .",
    "consequently , scatter in @xmath29 translates mainly into scatter in @xmath118 and not in @xmath231 .",

    "most remarkably , for our fiducial value of @xmath51 ( i.e. , model l1 ) , @xmath228 translates into scatter in both @xmath231 and @xmath234 but such that galaxies with different values of @xmath29 are aligned with the actual tf relation .",
    "consequently , @xmath228 contributes only weakly to the scatter in the tf relation .",
    "for @xmath235 we thus obtain a natural explanation for the small amount of scatter observed .",
    "different values of @xmath236 for otherwise identical galaxies results in different radii where @xmath120 }   = 10^{20 } { \\rm cm}^{-2}$ ] , and thus in different values of @xmath237 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : xinc ] , the rotation measures used in the model tf relations are fairly insensitive to @xmath236 , indicating that the rotation curves are close to flat . consequently , @xmath238 only adds a small fraction of the total scatter .",
    "an additional source of scatter , which has hitherto not been taken into account , stems from the variation in mass aggregation histories ( mahs ) , which induces scatter in the density profiles of halos of the same mass . for halos that are well represented by a nfw density profile ,",
    "this implies a scatter in the concentration parameter @xmath28 .",
    "thus if we know how scatter in mahs translates into scatter in @xmath28 we can investigate how this cosmological scatter adds to that of the tf relation .",
    "this information is provided by the high resolution numerical simulations of jing ( 1999 ) . in our models",
    "@xmath28 is computed from the collapse redshift of the halo , and we can thus introduce scatter in @xmath28 by instituting scatter in @xmath196 . to that extent we introduce a new parameter , @xmath239 , which sets the variance in collapse redshifts of a given mass , and tune it to reproduce the scatter in @xmath28 in the simulations of jing .",
    "although the amount of scatter increases strongly with the amount of halo substructure , the fragility of disks suggests that they are embedded in relatively smooth halos . we therefore normalize @xmath239 by fitting the distribution of concentration parameters in halos without significant amounts of substructure . in figure",
    "[ fig : chisto ] we plot the log - normal distribution that best fits the numerical simulations of jing , together with a histogram for halos in model l5 and with @xmath240 . except for a small offset in the zero - point , which is not important for obtaining an appropriate measure for the amount of scatter ,",

    "we can thus use @xmath241 as a representative measure for the standard deviation in mahs for halos surrounding disk galaxies .",

    "if finally we set @xmath239 to its fiducial value of @xmath249 , this further increases @xmath250 to @xmath251 mag .",
    "we find that for @xmath252 , the dispersion in halo collapse redshifts becomes the main source of scatter in the tf relation .",
    "v97 derived confidence levels on the amount of intrinsic scatter in the tf relation of equation  ( [ tffund ] ) , and found @xmath253 mag at 95 percent confidence level , with a most likely value of @xmath254 mag .",

    "previous studies of the tf relation based on sams were only able to rule against scdm , _ if the models were normalized to fit the luminosity function of galaxies_. the reason why we can rule out scdm without this additional constraint is our more sophisticated treatment of the relationship between @xmath171 and @xmath118 .",
    "whereas simple dynamics predict a tf relation with a slope of @xmath125 , the @xmath0-band tf relation reveals a slope of @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the physics regulating star formation and feedback , coupled with the mass dependence of halo densities and stellar populations , has to tilt the tf relation to its observed slope .",
    "the introduction of a stability - related star formation threshold density increases the slope of the tf relation , reduces its scatter , and yields gas mass fractions that are in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "setting toomre s @xmath51 parameter to its empirically determined value tilts the tf relation to a slope of @xmath270 , and additional physics are thus required to obtain a tf relation as steep as observed .",
    "we have presented four different physical mechanisms that all yield good fits to the observed @xmath0-band tf relation : lowering @xmath51 to @xmath271 , systematic variations in the @xmath0-band mass - to - light ratios , a power spectrum of initial density fluctuations that differs from that for cdm , and feedback . except for the latter , each of these results in inconsistencies with other observations , and",
    "can be ruled out as the prevailing mechanism for the observed characteristics of the near - infrared tf relation .    the feedback efficiency required to tilt the tf relation to its observed slope has to be higher in lower mass systems , and depends strongly on @xmath145 and @xmath39 ( if the baryon fraction is taken to be constrained by the nucleosynthesis results ) . in particular , in a flat universe with @xmath272 and @xmath161 ( a cosmological model that yields low density halos in agreement with observed rotation curves ) , @xmath226 percent of the available sn energy is required to fit the observed tf zero - point . although in principle",
    "unphysical , we do not wish to draw too strong conclusions from our oversimplified model for feedback .",
    "we do emphasize , however , that some amount of feedback is required to yield tf relations with a slope as steep as observed .",
    "more sophisticated models of sn feedback , such as in the work of mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) , are required to investigate whether our inferred feedback efficiencies are realistic .",
    "our best fitting models with feedback reveal a small amount of curvature in the tf relation , in qualitative agreement with recent observations of dwarf galaxies ( mathews , van driel & gallagher 1998 ; stil & israel 1998 ) .",
    "further constraints on the models come from the gas mass fractions , which require that virtually all the gas mass eligible for star formation ( i.e. , with densities above the critical density ) is transformed into stars over the lifetime of the galaxy .    for the fiducial value of @xmath51 the scatter in halo spin parameters affects both the luminosities and the observed rotation velocities , but to such a degree that galaxies are scattered along the tf relation , rather than perpendicular to it .",
    "the introduction of star formation threshold densities thus yield a natural explanation for the small amount of scatter observed .",
    "taking account of a realistic spread in halo concentrations , consistent with what one expects from the spread in mass aggregation histories , our model that best fits the zero - point and slope of the @xmath0-band tf relation predicts a scatter of @xmath273 mag only , in excellent agreement with observations . in a follow - up paper ( van den bosch & dalcanton 1999 ) we compare the models presented here to numerous other observational constraints .    this work has benefited greatly from discussions with marcella longhetti , claudia maraston , jeroen stil , and marc verheijen .",
    "i am indebted to julianne dalcanton and george lake for advice and critical assessments of an earlier draft of the paper , to stphane charlot for providing results from his stellar population models , and to the anonymous referee for his comments that helped improve the presentation of the paper .",
