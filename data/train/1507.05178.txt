    "cosmic voids are regarded as one of the most striking features of the universe on its larger scales ever since they were found in the first galaxy surveys @xcite . however , due to the large volume extension of void regions ( @xmath2 ) , statistically meaningful catalogues of voids @xcite have only become available through modern galaxy surveys such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2df ) @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite .",
    "these observational breakthroughs generated a great interest in the last decade to study voids @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , the basic framework that explains the origin of voids was established in the seminal work of @xcite and refined in the following decades .",
    "the first detailed theoretical models describing formation , dynamics and properties of voids @xcite were complemented and extended by numerical studies @xcite . currently , the most popular approach to study voids relies on n - body simulations . for an extensive compilation of previous numerical works we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the relevance of voids to cosmological studies can be summarized in three aspects @xcite .",
    "firstly , voids are a key ingredient of the cosmic web .",
    "they dominate the volume distribution at large scales and compensate overdense structures in the total matter budget .",
    "secondly , voids provide a valuable resource to estimate cosmological parameters as their structure and dynamics are sensitive to them .",
    "finally , they are a largely pristine environment to test galaxy evolution .    although visual recognition of voids in galaxy surveys and simulations is possible in most cases , we need a clear algorithmic identification procedure to make statistical studies .",
    "nevertheless , the community has not reached yet an unambiguous definition of cosmic voids .",
    "there are many different void finding techniques in the literature ( for a detailed comparison of different schemes , see the publication on the results of the void finder comparison project @xcite ) . in spite of the diversity of existing schemes",
    ", they can be roughly classified into two types : point - based and field - based .",
    "there are geometric schemes based on point distributions ( either real or redshift space ) f galaxies in surveys or dark matter halos in simulations @xcite . while other schemes are based on the smooth and continuous matter density field either from simulations or from reconstruction procedures on surveys @xcite .",
    "our work follows the tradition of the second kind of schemes .",
    "here we introduce a new algorithm to define voids over the continuous matter density or velocity distribution defined on a fixed and homogeneous spatial grid .",
    "the algorithm uses the results from two tensorial schemes used to classify the cosmic web .",
    "the first ( the t - web ) is based on the hessian of the gravitational potential or tidal tensor @xcite .",
    "the second ( the v - web ) is based on the velocity shear tensor @xcite .",
    "our procedure allows for a description of a void internal structure beyond a simple definition of a void as an underdense region in the large - scale matter distribution .",
    "the tidal and the shear tensors encode more information than the density / velocity fields as they trace the collapsing or expanding nature of the matter field , which defines the dynamics of the cosmic web .",
    "the tracer that we use to define the voids is the fractional anisotropy ( fa ) computed from the set of eigenvalues of the tensor under consideration .",
    "the fa was initially introduced by @xcite to quantify the anisotropy degree of the diffusivity of water molecules through cerebral tissue in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging , thereby allowing to detect structures that restrict the otherwise isotropic brownian movement of water molecules .",
    "taking into account that this process is identical to the velocity shear in the large - scale matter distribution , @xcite introduced the concept of the fa in the context of cosmic web classification schemes .    in the next sections (  [ sec : algorithms_cosmic_web ] and  [ sec : bulk_voids ] ) we establish the fa as a void tracer and then proceed to identify individual voids as basins of fa local minima . at this point",
    "we implement a _ watershed transform algorithm _",
    "@xcite which has been used to define voids as catching basins of local minima of the density field @xcite .",
    "finally we find and charachterize voids in a n - body (  [ sec : simulations ] and  [ sec : results ] ) using density , velocity and fractional anisotropy profiles .",
    "we use these results to comment on the qualities of our algorithm (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "our new void finding method is based on two existing cosmic web classification schemes that work on cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "both schemes depend on the construction of tensors based on the hessian of the potential ( t - web scheme ) and the shear of the velocity ( v - web scheme ) .",
    "these algorithms have been used to develop other kind of studies such as the alignment of the shape , spin and peculiar velocity of dark matter halos with the cosmic web @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the most relevant aspects of each scheme .",
    "we refer the reader to the papers of @xcite ( t - web ) and @xcite ( v - web ) for detailed descriptions .",
    "this scheme was initially proposed by @xcite to find the cosmic web based on the tidal tensor .",
    "the tidal tensor allows a classification in terms of the orbital dynamics of the matter field .",
    "this approach extends to second - order the equations of motion around local minima of the gravitational potential .",
    "the second - order term corresponds to the tidal tensor , which is defined as the hessian matrix of the normalized gravitational potential    @xmath3 where the physical gravitational potential has been rescaled by a factor of @xmath4 in such a way that @xmath5 satisfies the following poisson equation    @xmath6 with @xmath7 the average density in the universe , @xmath8 the gravitational constant and @xmath9 the dimensionless matter overdensity .",
    "since the tidal tensor can be represented by a real and symmetric @xmath10 matrix , it is always possible to diagonalize it and obtain three real eigenvalues @xmath11 with its corresponding eigenvectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenvalues are indicators of the local orbital stability in each direction @xmath15 .",
    "the sign of the eigenvalues can be used to classify the cosmic web .",
    "the number of positive ( stable ) or negative ( unstable ) eigenvalues allows to label a location into one of the next four types of environment : voids ( 3 negative eigenvalues ) , sheets ( 2 ) , filaments ( 1 ) and knots ( 0 ) .",
    "a modification to this scheme was introduced by @xcite by means of a relaxation of the stability criterion .",
    "the relative strength of each eigenvalue is no longer defined by the sign , but instead by a threshold value @xmath16 that can be tuned in such a way that the visual impression of the web - like matter distribution is reproduced .",
    "the v - web scheme for environment finding introduced by @xcite is based on the local velocity shear tensor calculated from the smoothed dark matter velocity field in the simulation .",
    "this tensor is given by the following expression    @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the @xmath20 component of the comoving velocity and position , respectively .",
    "like the tidal tensor , @xmath21 can be represented by a @xmath10 symmetric matrix with real values , making it possible to find three real eigenvalues and its corresponding eigenvectors .    in this case",
    "we also use the relative strength of the three eigenvalues with respect to a threshold value @xmath22 to classify the cosmic web in the four web types already mentioned .",
    "usually , the threshold @xmath22 is a free parameter that is tuned to reproduce the visual appearance of the comic web .",
    "however , in this paper this threshold does not play any role in our computations . in figure",
    "[ fig : l1_correlations ] we offer a threshold estimate ( from the fa=@xmath23 as a function of @xmath24 , this choice is explained in the next section ) only as a guide to readers familiar with its meaning .",
    "[ fig : l1_correlations ]    [ fig : fa_environment ]",
    "the fractional anisotropy ( fa ) , as developed by @xcite , was conceived to quantify the anisotropy of the diffusivity of water molecules through cerebral tissue in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging . in this manner",
    ", barriers such as microtubules and cell membranes , that restrict the otherwise isotropic brownian motion of water molecules , can be detected . in a cosmological context ,",
    "the problem of finding structures is very similar , where filaments and sheets restrict the otherwise isotropic collapsing / expanding dynamics of the matter . taking this into account ,",
    "we present here the fa , much in the same way as @xcite , to use it as a tracer of cosmic voids .",
    "the fa is defined as follows @xmath25 where the eigenvalues can be taken from either the t - web or the v - web ( fa - t - web and fa - v - web respectively ) .",
    "such as it is defined , fa@xmath26 corresponds to an isotropic distribution ( @xmath27 ) and fa@xmath28 to a highly anisotropic distribution .    in the left and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fa_field ] we show the fa field and web classification for both web schemes over a slice of an n - body simulation ( described in section [ sec : simulations ] ) . comparing these two panels",
    "we see that voids and knots ( white and black in the middle panel of fig .",
    "1 ) display low fa values at their centres , becoming gradually more anisotropic at outer regions . on the other hand the filamentary structure ( grey in the middle panel of fig .",
    "1 ) is traced by middle to high fa values .",
    "this characteristic is the key to use the fa as a tracer of cosmic voids .",
    "voids are regions where @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that a void is completely fixed by the relative strength of the @xmath24 eigenvalue with respect to the threshold .",
    "as we increase / decrease the threshold value @xmath16 , voids increase / decrease progressively through contours of increasing / decreasing @xmath24 .",
    "voids are thus characterized by low values of both fa and @xmath24 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : l1_correlations ] we show that the these two values are correlated .",
    "the left panel shows the correlation between the fa and @xmath24 and the middle panel between the overdensity @xmath9 and @xmath24 .",
    "the right panel shows the correlation between @xmath9 and the fa .",
    "this shows that the density has a larger scatter at fixed @xmath24 than the fa , yet large and small values of the density remain still associated to low values of the fa .    at this point ,",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath24 and the fa appear to be equally potential candidates for tracing cosmic voids , however , the eigenvalue @xmath24 presents , along with the overdensity , an undesirable feature for a void tracer .",
    "as we move out from inner parts of voids to outer parts , @xmath24 and @xmath9 increase monotonically making unclear where to set the void boundary , while for low density regions ( @xmath30 ) the fa traces the boundary where anisotropic collapsing regions begin to dominate , i.e. at the ridge reached around @xmath31 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : l1_correlations ] . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : fa_environment ] these anisotropic areas are mainly associated to sheets and , to a lesser extent , filaments .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : fa_field ] and [ fig : l1_correlations ] we conclude that the fa is a good tracer of voids as it is almost perfectly correlated with low values of @xmath24 .",
    "we propose that voids should be composed completely by regions of fa@xmath32 .",
    "if we increase the values of @xmath24 from its minimum until it we reach fa@xmath33 in [ fig : l1_correlations ] we find that this correspond to critical values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the t - web and v - web , respectively .",
    "this means that setting @xmath22 to either @xmath36/@xmath37 automatically produces voids with all the cells fa@xmath32 .",
    "the middle panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fa_field ] show the web classification for this choice of @xmath22 , demonstrating that this fa level is a reasonable choice to define voids .",
    "the previous section shows that fa is a good void tracer , but how should we actually define the boundary of individual voids ?",
    "for this purpose , we use the _ watershed transform algorithm _ @xcite to identify a void as the basin of fa local minima with boundaries of fa@xmath33 .",
    "the advantage of this definition is that it does not require any assumption on the shape and/or morphology of the tentative voids .    however , there are two main differences in our approach with respect to other watershed implementations .",
    "first , the watershed technique commonly uses the density field instead of the fa field as we do here @xcite .",
    "second , we estimate all relevant quantities on a cartesian mesh of fixed cell size , while other works use an adaptive delaunay tessellation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in our case the average number of particles per cell is large enough ( @xmath38 particles / cell ) ensuring that the lowest density regions are sampled with at least @xmath39 particles ( @xmath40 ) , which seems to avoid spurious results from a noisy density field sampling .",
    "the watershed algorithm also needs a threshold value to reduce spurious features and prevent void hierarchization .",
    "if the density field is used , a typical threshold is @xmath41 @xcite , which means that , given two neighbouring voids , if the mean value of the density across their common boundary is below that threshold , the two voids are merged . in our case",
    "we have to find a corresponding fa value to define this threshold .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : l1_correlations ] we see how the fa correlates with the matter overdensity .",
    "a value of @xmath42 corresponds to a value of fa@xmath43 regardless of the web - finding scheme .",
    "this is the value we choose to remove ridges between two watershed voids .",
    "the right column in fig .",
    "[ fig : fa_field ] shows all the individual voids that have been identified using the watershed algorithm on the fa field .",
    "[ fig : volume_function ]",
    "we use the bolshoi simulation to test our void finding method .",
    "this simulation follows the non - linear evolution of a dark matter density field on a cubic volume of size @xmath44  sampled with @xmath45 particles .",
    "the cosmological parameters in the simulation are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the matter density , cosmological constant , dimensionless hubble parameter , spectral index of primordial density perturbations and normalization for the power spectrum , respectively",
    ". these values are consistent with the ninth year of data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite . for more detailed technical information about the simulation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we use data for the cosmic web identification that is publicly available through the multidark database http://www.multidark.org/multidark/ which is described in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe the process to obtain the data . for details",
    "see @xcite ( t - web ) ; @xcite ( v - web ) .",
    "this data is based on a _ cloud - in - cell _ ( ` cic ` ) interpolation of the density and velocity fields of the simulation onto a grid of @xmath51 cells , corresponding to a spatial resolution of @xmath52  per cell side .",
    "these fields are smoothed with a gaussian filter with a width of @xmath53 .",
    "the tidal and shear tensors and corresponding eigenvalues are computed through finite - differences over the potential and velocity fields .",
    "we limit our results to voids with effective radius larger than the smoothing length of the density field , i.e. @xmath54 . for smaller interpolation / smoothing scales the shot noise in the low density regions starts to be noticeable . with that choice",
    "we find a void volume filling fraction @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the fa - vweb and the fa - tweb , respectively . for larger smoothing scales ( @xmath57 )",
    "the density and shear fields tend to be gaussian and therefore follow closely the analytical environment abundance predictions for gaussian random fields @xcite . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to a smoothing scale @xmath54 .    in the following subsections",
    "we describe the results for the size distribution and different radial profiles for all our samples .",
    "void shapes exhibit a wide range of geometries . to define their size we use its equivalent spherical radius or effective radius , defined as @xmath58^{1/3}$ ] , with @xmath59 the total volume of the void computed from the individual grid cells assigned to the void . in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume_function ] we show the void size distributions for the t - web and the v - web .",
    "we see that the void distribution for the t - web is broadly consistent with the expectations from a two - barrier problem @xcite .",
    "the formation of large voids is limited by the _ void - in - void _ mechanism ( first barrier ) where large voids are constituted hierarchically of smaller ones . in turn",
    ", the formation of small voids is damped by the _ void - in - cloud _ mechanism ( second barrier ) , where nearby collapsing structures limit the abundance of small embedded voids .",
    "we also find that the v - web scheme produces an over - abundance of small voids compared to t - web .",
    "a large number of these small voids are embedded in overdense regions .",
    "they are already visible in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fa_field ] as tiny white bubbles located inside sheets .",
    "the existence of these small voids can be explained by dynamics of shell crossing in collapsing sheets as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main argument is that as matter collides into a pancake - like fashion crossing sheets encounter each other at the symmetry plane .",
    "this effectively gives a positive divergence in the velocity field , resulting in a void identification by the v - web algorithm .",
    "comparing the abundance of large voids in the two web schemes , we find that the largest voids in the v - web have @xmath60 , while the t - web scheme includes voids as large as @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that large voids in the t - web scheme have a velocity structure that splits them in the v - web .",
    "this increased granularity in the velocity structure of voids is evident in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fa_field ] .",
    "[ fig : density_profile ]    [ fig : velocity_profile ]    [ fig : fa_profile ]      we find that voids are distributed in two different families differentiated by the presence / absence of an overdense matter ridge in their density profiles .",
    "to discriminate each void in one of the families we use the compensation index @xmath62 it is defined as the mass of a void enclosed in a spherical volume of radius @xmath63 and normalized by the mass of the same volume assuming it is filled by matter with the mean background density .",
    "@xmath64 r^2 dr\\ ] ]    we choose an integration radius of @xmath65 , that is large enough to enclose the compensation ridge for a typical void in case there is one .",
    "this leads us to voids with @xmath66 having more mass than expected , constituting the family of overcompensated voids .",
    "these voids generally exhibit a compensation ridge associated to dense nearby structures . in the same fashion ,",
    "voids with @xmath67 constitute the family of subcompensated voids .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_profile ] we show the density and velocity profiles of voids split in these two families . in the left column",
    "it becomes clear the difference between sub- and overcompensated voids .",
    "table [ tab : number_voids ] lists the number of voids in each effective radius bin for the two web finding methods .",
    ".number of voids for each bin of effective radius and for subcompensanted and overcompansated samples . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we calculate the contrast density , radial - projected velocity and fa profiles . for this purpose",
    "we stack voids with similar effective radius .",
    "we also compute the profiles separately for subcompensated and overcompensated voids . for each void , we take the distance of each member cell to the void centre along with the properties of interest . we normalize the radial distance with the effective radius and add the result to the stack .    fig .",
    "[ fig : density_profile ] shows the results of stacked density profiles for different void sizes .",
    "we calculate the profile out to a radius @xmath68 to capture the point where the overdensity reaches the mean value .",
    "the first interesting result is the overdensity value at the void s centre .",
    "we find that larger voids have a lower overdensity value .",
    "the largest voids ( @xmath69 ) have an underdensity @xmath70 while smaller voids ( @xmath71 ) fall around @xmath72 at their centres .",
    "this holds for both web schemes .",
    "these values are consistent with most of the void finding schemes based on smooth and continuous fields from simulation or reconstruction procedures on surveys @xcite , unlike geometrical approaches based on point distributions , where central density values are generally higher @xcite .",
    "a second feature about these profiles is their steepness at inner regions . in subcompensated voids ,",
    "larger voids are steeper .",
    "smaller voids exhibit moderate slopes , reaching the mean density at larger radii than larger voids .",
    "this suggests that small subcompensated voids are embedded into low density structures , while large subcompensated voids are surrounded by dense structures , reaching the mean density at lower effective radii than smaller voids . in the overcompensated case",
    "larger voids reach first both the compensation ridge and then the mean density value .    regarding overcompensated voids ,",
    "a final result is related to the height of the compensation ridge : the larger the void size , the lower the ridge height .",
    "this implies that overcompensated smaller voids are embedded in very high density regions , unlike their subcompensated counterpart , thus indicating two possibly different processes for small voids formation .",
    "larger voids exhibit lower ridges as outer radial layers also includes all sort of structures , thus being the difference between large overcompensated and subcompensated voids less conclusive .",
    "all the previous results hold for both finding schemes .",
    "this suggests an universal behaviour for the radial density profile in two families of subcompensated and overcompensanted voids .",
    "this goes in the same direction of recent results about the internal @xcite and external structure of voids @xcite . indeed",
    ", our results extend the findings of @xcite into the range of voids with size @xmath73 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity_profile ] we present the radial velocity profiles .",
    "positive values correspond to outflows with respect to the centre .",
    "we find that subcompensated voids have outflowing velocity profiles all the way up to the radius where the average radial density reaches zero . in voids with sizes @xmath74 the outflow is always positive , consistent with the fact that their density profiles do not reach the level @xmath75 in the range of explored radii .",
    "this behaviour indicates that matter is being pulled out of the void into external higher density features .    on the other hand ,",
    "overcompensated voids initially exhibit outward profiles , ( as expected from a low density region ) and approximately at the radius of the compensation ridge , the velocity reaches a peak , decreases and becomes negative , showing the infalling flow of matter further than the compensation ridge .",
    "this shows that the high density structures associated to the compensation ridge dominate the matter flow both from inside and outside the void .    as in the density",
    ", these results are also consistent with a universal velocity profile for voids @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fa_profile ] shows the results for the fa profiles .",
    "we find that the fa clearly magnifies the difference between the internal profile @xmath76 and the external profile @xmath77 .",
    "subcompensanted voids in the t - web reach an asymptotic background value of f=@xmath78 almost right at @xmath79 . for the v - web the results are similar , albeit with a slower trend with the effective radius .",
    "overcompensated voids reach a maximum fa at the same effective radius @xmath80 and decline to reach an asymptotic value of fa=@xmath81 at larger radii .",
    "the central fa values also show a magnified trend with the void size .",
    "large voids have lower fa values , amplifying the same trend observed with the central density value .",
    "finally , we observe that voids in the v - web scheme span a larger range of central fa values than in the t - web scheme .    the difference between the radius where the density ridge is reached ( @xmath82 ) and the radius of the fa maxima ( @xmath80 , most manifest in the t - web voids ) justifies in a more quantitative way the qualitative argument we present in sub - section [ subsec : watershed ] to define void boundaries in our method .",
    "namely that as we increase the void boundary moving away from the centre , we reach first middle density walls , before reaching high density structures associated with high anisotropy .",
    "this implies that voids defined with the fa never present positive overdensities , making the fa maximum a reasonable boundary for voids compared to the traditional definition that puts the boundary at the density ridge .",
    "we recognize that our choice produces smaller voids as compared with other voids finding methods .",
    "we consider that this has the advantage of avoiding the contamination from external structures .",
    "in this paper we propose that the anisotropy of the eigenvalues from tidal and velocity shear tensors is a good tracer of cosmic voids .",
    "based on this idea we go on to implement a watershed algorithm on the fractional anisotropy to find voids in a n - body cosmological simulation .",
    "we perform different test on the voids found on the anisotropy of two tensorial schemes , the t - web and the v - web .",
    "the first quantity we examine is the void size distribution characterized by an effective radius .",
    "we find that for the t - web scheme the void size distribution has a shape consistent with standard expectations from a two - barrier setup .",
    "however , for the v - web we find an overabundance of the smallest voids .",
    "this is due to two reasons .",
    "first , there are artefacts in the web finding scheme inside sheets .",
    "second , there v - web produces smaller fragmented voids inside the largest voids found in the t - web classification .",
    "this void fragmentation hints at a complex velocity structure in large voids compared to its simpler density / gravitational potential anatomy .",
    "a second step in the void characterization is the separation into subcompensated and overcompensated samples . in the t - web @xmath1 of the voids",
    "are overcompensated and @xmath0 subcompensated , meaning that they are located in denser regions with a clear delimiting ridge .",
    "for the v - web the subcompensated fraction rises to @xmath83 as the void size decreases , supporting the picture of smaller spurious voids located in medium density matter sheets .",
    "finally we proceed with a more detailed void characterization through the radially averaged profiles of density , radial velocity and fractional anisotropy . in this case",
    "we study separately the subcompensated and overcompensated voids , split this time in samples with different effective radii .    for the density",
    "the most interesting feature is that the profile has a similar shape for all the different void sizes once the radial coordinate is expressed in units of the effective radius . in these profiles",
    "it is evident the presence of an overdense ridge around @xmath84 for the overcompensated voids .",
    "subcompensated voids do not show such a ridge keeping its density lower than the average value up to @xmath85 .",
    "in other studies where voids are found using considerations on the density fields the ridge is , almost by definition , located around @xmath86 and the subcompensated voids reach average density around @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates that voids defined by fa boundaries are smaller than voids found by density only considerations close by a radial factor of @xmath88 .",
    "the velocity profiles show the expected correlation with the features already observed in the density .",
    "most notably the radial velocity goes to zero close to flat regions in the density profile and is positive around regions of increasing density with radius .",
    "the fa profiles also show remarkable similarities inside each class of subcompensated and overcompensated voids and a close correlation with the behaviour in the density and velocity profiles . from these profiles",
    "it becomes clear that the limit of overcompensated void coincides with a ridge in of fa values close to @xmath89 .",
    "this value is close to the limit fa=@xmath23 we impose in the watershed algorithm , indicating that these voids are very close to spherical . for",
    "the subcompensated voids the fa quickly increases to fa values of @xmath90 at @xmath86 to find a plateau , which is quite far from the limiting fa@xmath33 suggesting that these voids are ellipsoidal .    put together , the results for the radially averaged profiles support the evidence for a universal density profile .",
    "our results extend to smaller void sizes the work done by @xcite on simulations and by @xcite on sdss data .",
    "the method we present here finds voids with reasonable properties compared to different results published in the literature .",
    "this gives support to a new tracer , the fractional anisotropy , to be used in the study of cosmic voids .",
    "furthermore , the complementary physical picture in the two different web finding algorithms opens the possibilities to make a joint analysis of the tidal and dynamical structure of voids .",
