    "the structure of a given graph can range in complexity from being quite simple , having some regular features or small edge and vertex sets to being extremely complicated where basic characteristics of the graph are hard to obtain or estimate .",
    "such complicated structure is typical if for instance the graph represents some real network @xcite .",
    "an important problem therefore is whether it is possible to simplify or reduce a graph while maintaining its basic graph structure as well as some characteristic(s ) of the original graph .",
    "a related key question then is which characteristic(s ) to conserve while reducing a graph .",
    "studies of dynamical networks ( i.e. networks of interacting dynamical systems which could be cells , power stations , etc . ) reveal that an important characteristic of a network s structure is the spectrum of the network s adjacency matrix @xcite .",
    "with this in mind we present an approach which allows for the reduction of a general weighted digraph in such a way that the spectrum of the graph s ( weighted ) adjacency matrix is maintained up to some well defined and known set .",
    "we denote the class of graphs for which reductions are possible by @xmath0 which consists of the set of all finite weighted digraphs without parallel edges but possibly with loops having weights in the set @xmath1 of complex rational functions .",
    "a graph @xmath2 can therefore be written as the triple @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the vertex and edge sets of @xmath6 respectively and @xmath7 .",
    "each such graph has an adjacency matrix with a well defined spectrum which we denote by @xmath8 . with this in place a graph reduction of @xmath6",
    "can be described as follows .",
    "given a specific subset @xmath9 which we call a _",
    "structural sets _ of @xmath6 , an _ isospectral reduction _ of @xmath6 over the vertex set @xmath10 is a weighted digraph @xmath11 ( see section 3 for the exact definitions ) .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following theorem ( see theorem [ theorem1 ] ) . + * theorem : * let @xmath2 and @xmath10 be a structural set of @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath12 and @xmath13 differ at most by @xmath14 .",
    "+ the set @xmath14 is a finite set of complex numbers which is known and is the largest set by which @xmath12 and @xmath13 can differ .    as a typical graph has many different structural sets it is possible to consider different isospectral reductions of the same graph .",
    "moreover , since a reduced graph is again a weighted digraph it is possible to consider sequences of such reductions .",
    "the flexibility of this process is reflected in the fact that for a typical graph @xmath2 it is possible to reduce @xmath6 to a graph on any nonempty subset of its original vertex set .",
    "that is , we may simplify the structure of @xmath6 to whatever degree we desire .    from this",
    "it follows that if @xmath15 is any nonempty subset of the vertices of @xmath6 then there are typically multiple ways to sequentially reduce @xmath6 to a graph on @xmath15 . as it turns out each such reduction results in the same graph independent of the particular sequence .",
    "this uniqueness result can be interpreted as the property that sequential reductions on @xmath0 are commutative .",
    "furthermore , the class of graphs which can be reduced via this method is very general .",
    "specifically , we may reduce those graphs in @xmath0 which consist of weighted digraphs without parallel edges .",
    "since undirected and unweighted graphs or graphs with parallel edges can be considered as weighted digraphs via some standard conventions then such graphs are automatically included as special cases of graphs that may be reduced by this procedure .    because of the flexibility in reducing a graph the relation of having the same branch reduction is not an equivalence relation on the set @xmath0 as this relation is not transitive .",
    "however , it is possible to construct specific types of structural sets as well as rules for sequential reductions which do induce equivalence relations on the graphs in @xmath0 which we give examples of .",
    "also we note that generally , the tradeoff in reducing a graph is that although the graph structure becomes simpler the weights of edges become more complicated .",
    "therefore , we also consider graph reductions over fixed weight sets in which the weight set of the graph is maintained under this reduction while the vertex set is reduced .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present notation and some general definitions . sect .",
    "3 contains the description of the reduction procedure as well as some results on sequences of such reductions .",
    "some of the main results and techniques of the paper are then stated in sect .",
    "proofs of these statements are given in sect.5 . in sect .",
    "6 we study the relations between the strongly connected components of the graph and its reductions . sect . 7 considers reductions over fixed weight sets and sect .",
    "8 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in what follows we formally consider the class of digraphs consisting of all finite weighted digraphs with or without loops having edge weights in the set @xmath1 of complex rational functions described below .",
    "we denote this class of graphs by @xmath0 .",
    "as previously mentioned , graphs or which are either undirected , unweighted , or have parallel edges can be considered as graphs in @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by making an undirected graph @xmath6 into a directed graph by orienting each of its edges in both directions .",
    "similarly , if @xmath6 is unweighted then it can be made weighted by giving each edge unit weight .",
    "also multiple edges between two vertices of @xmath6 may be considered as a single edge by adding the weights of the multiple edges and setting this to be the weight of this single equivalent edge .",
    "we will typically assume that the graph @xmath2 or use these conventions to make it so .    by way of notation we let the digraph @xmath6 , possibly with loops , be the pair @xmath16 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the finite sets denoting the _ vertices _ and _ edges _ of @xmath6 respectively , the edges corresponding to ordered pairs @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath6 is a _ weighted digraph _ with weights in @xmath1 then @xmath19 together with a function @xmath7 where @xmath20 is the _ weight _ of the edge @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath23 if and only if @xmath24 . importantly , if @xmath2 then similar to digraphs we will denote this by writing @xmath3 .    in order to describe the set of weights @xmath1 let @xmath25 $ ] denote the set of polynomials in the single complex variable @xmath26 with complex coefficients .",
    "we define the set @xmath1 to be the set of rational functions of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 have no common factors and @xmath30 is nonzero .",
    "the set @xmath1 is then a field under addition and multiplication with the convention that common factors are removed when two elements are combined .",
    "that is , if @xmath31 then @xmath32 where the common factors of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are removed .",
    "similarly , in the product @xmath35 of @xmath27 and @xmath36 the common factors of @xmath37 and @xmath34 are removed .",
    "however , we may at times leave sums and the products of sums of elements in @xmath1 uncombined and therefore possibly unreduced but this is purely cosmetic since there is one reduced form for any element in @xmath1 .    to introduce the spectrum associated to a graph having weights in @xmath1 we will use the following notation .",
    "if the vertex set of the graph @xmath3 is labeled @xmath38 then we denote the edge @xmath39 by @xmath40 .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 defined entrywise by @xmath42 is the _ weighted adjacency matrix _ of @xmath6 .",
    "we let the _ spectrum _ of a matrix @xmath43 with entries in @xmath1 be the solutions including multiplicities of the equation @xmath44 and for the graph @xmath6 we let @xmath12 denote the spectrum of @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum of a matrix with entries in @xmath1 is therefore a generalization of the spectrum of a matrix with complex entries .",
    "moreover , the spectrum is a _ list _ of numbers .",
    "that is , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the multiplicity of the solutions @xmath48 to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath29 the number of distinct solutions , and @xmath49 the elements in the list . in what follows",
    "we may write a list as a set with multiplicities if this is more convenient .",
    "in this section we describe the main results of the paper .",
    "that is , we present a method which allows for the reduction a graph while maintaining the graph s spectrum up to some known set .",
    "we also give specific examples of this process notably using this method to reduce graphs associated with the laplacian matrix of a graph .",
    "some natural consequences and extensions of this process are also mentioned .",
    "here we first introduce some definitions as well as some terminology that allow us to be precise in our formulation of an isospectral reduction .    in the following if @xmath9 where @xmath4 is the vertex set of a digraph let @xmath50 denote the complement of @xmath10 in @xmath4 .",
