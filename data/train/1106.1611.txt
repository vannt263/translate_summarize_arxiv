    "the current body of astronomical data makes it very difficult to live without dark energy .",
    "combination of the supernova data with the 7 year results from wmap and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data on baryonic acoustic oscillations combine almost seamlessly with observations of the hubble constant and the light element abundances to paint a picture which has become known as the standard cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the universe is not homogeneous however and observations of galaxy clustering , n - body simulations and the simplest theoretical considerations all predict that the majority of the volume of today s universe is considerably underdense in terms of matter , which forms roughly shaped denser walls surrounding the underdense voids @xcite .",
    "the universe is made up therefore mostly of the voids between overdense regions , a situation which has lead to evocative comparisons of the universe with both a froth of bubbles and with swiss cheese @xcite .",
    "such underdense regions have been studied in detail to understand their effects on cosmological observables @xcite and to investigate whether they can help explain the various observations of the universe without dark energy @xcite - this might be possible if we are located close to the centre of a very large void @xcite .",
    "such a void would typically have to be larger than 100 mpc in radius , in comparison to the voids which have definitely been observed in the universe which vary in size between very roughly 5 - 20 mpc . in order to create such large voids",
    ", it would be necessary to have a very non - trivial power spectrum of perturbations @xcite . in this work",
    "we attempt to reach a much less ambitious goal and we only consider the voids which we have evidence to believe actually exist .",
    "the nature of dark energy is unknown .",
    "in particular , it is not known if its energy density remains completely constant over time or whether it is growing or decreasing .",
    "if dark energy can be modelled as a perfect fluid then any such evolution is determined by the equation of state of the fluid @xmath0 which relates the energy density and the pressure , @xmath1 . by fitting supernova data , we are able to constrain that equation of state and future investigations hope to pin it down with increasing accuracy .",
    "voids can be considered not only to provide additional constraints on @xmath0 @xcite , but also as potential sources of error . in this study",
    "we estimate what the effect of voids will be upon the reconstruction of the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath0 , from the supernova data . in order to do this , we look at the evolution of voids in a universe that contains collisionless matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "we consider distant voids in which supernovae explode and look at the effect upon photons as they climb out of their host void walls and move towards us .",
    "the presence of the voids increases the scatter in the luminosity redshift plane - we aim to estimate this error and see how it compares with other errors on the reconstruction of @xmath0 .",
    "we do not expect the error to be large since the fluctuations in the gravitational potential will be very small , less than a percent .",
    "however , since the velocity dispersion of supernovae relative to the hubble flow can create an observable effect , we feel it is worthwhile investigating the magnitude of the error due to these smaller voids .",
    "we do this in a way which is not entirely self - consistent - this shortcoming lies in the fact that we evolve voids in a @xmath2cdm universe and then apply the estimated error to other kinds of dark energy where @xmath3 .",
    "the reason we do this is that although it is in principle possible to study voids evolving in a background of dark energy with @xmath4 , the evolution of such voids involves the solution of a complex set of partial differential equations , whereas voids evolving in a cosmological constant background are the result of ordinary differential equations and are therefore simpler to analyse numerically .",
    "we hope to estimate the magnitude of the error one expects from these walls in the knowledge that when one includes baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the equation of state @xmath0 is constrained to lie quite close to @xmath5 anyway .",
    "we note that much more complicated analyses might be done in future if it becomes necessary .    in the next section",
    "we will outline the equations that we evolve as well as the functional form of the void models we choose .",
    "we will then describe our numerical procedures and present our results before making conclusions .",
    "although we will assume that all the matter in the universe has evolved into voids and void walls , our interest is focused on the hole nearest to the source only .",
    "we assume that the effects of _ complete _ holes situated between the source and the observer cancel out along the light path and we neglect the void that we are located in since all photons must arrive into the same current potential well .",
    "we construct our swiss - cheese model of the universe by combining two components : the cheese , where the metric is described by a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solution and the holes , where the matter is mainly underdense by volume and we use the lematre - tolman - bondi solution .",
    "unlike the idea that we are at the centre of a very large void which is used to live without dark energy , we will therefore be in the cheese , looking at distant holes .",
    "our model is based on the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) metric , a spherically symmetric solution of einstein s equations , which can be written as ( in units where @xmath6)@xmath7 where we use comoving coordinates @xmath8 and proper time @xmath9 . for pressureless dust and a cosmological constant ,",
    "einstein s equations imply the following constraints:@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where a dot stands for partial derivative with respect to @xmath9 and a prime with respect to @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the energy density of the matter , @xmath15 is newton s constant and @xmath2 is the cosmological constant . to specify the model we intend to use , we have to define the two arbitary functions @xmath16 , corresponding to the spatial curvature , and @xmath17 , which is simply the mass integrated within a comoving radial coordinate @xmath13:@xmath18 both of these functions are completely defined therefore by the choice of an initial density profile @xmath19 , where @xmath20 refers to the beginning of the ltb evolution and is set to a constant for simplicity .",
    "we then have to choose @xmath16 in order to match the flat frw model at the boundary of the hole .",
    "this choice also ensures that the average density inside the hole equals the one outside , so that an observer situated in the cheese would not be aware , _ locally _ , of the presence of the hole .",
    "we intend to test our model by sending photons through the voids and measuring redshifts .",
    "to do so , we must integrate the equation for their radial trajectory@xmath21    to repeat and clarify , in contrast to other models based on the swiss - cheese universe , we assume that the observer , although occupying no particular position in space with respect to the holes , is always situated in the cheese ; we then consider only the effects caused by the furthest hole where the supernovae are located ( see subsection 3.a for more details ) and hence the geodesics originate since in this study we want to investigate the effect of the void at the origin of the photons rather than when they arrive here .      to characterise the ltb model we intend to use , we have to define the initial density profile @xmath19 .",
    "we then will build the two arbitrary functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 based on this profile .",
    "the expression we choose for it is based on kostov s parametrisation @xcite where the density profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : initial - density - profile ] ) is defined as follows:@xmath22-a_{3}tanh\\left[\\beta\\left(r - r_{2}\\right)\\right]\\right\\ } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radius of the void ; and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "given @xmath27 , the values of the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 are chosen so that @xmath30 and the integrated mass inside the hole @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath16 plays the role of the spatial curvature in the ltb solution .",
    "it is defined using eq .",
    "[ eq : ltb2 ] and considering the initial time of the ltb evolution @xmath32 . at this early time ,",
    "@xmath33 and we have , in real units:@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average energy density at time @xmath9 .    in order to guarantee that the chosen parametrisation of the voids is consistent with observational constraints , we compare the density profiles with observed values of over- and underdensities at different times of the ltb evolution : at initial time @xmath36 and at final time @xmath37 .",
    "we set @xmath32 to be the time of last scattering , @xmath38 .",
    "so the constraint at initial time comes from the scale of temperature fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xmath39 , which corresponds to a variation in density of the order of @xmath40 .    at the other extremity , when @xmath37 , the guideline for density profiles is given by observations of the present underdensities in the matter distribution of our universe .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the voids that we see nowadays probably correspond to regions where the density is @xmath41 of the mean cosmic density .",
    "further constraints on the size of the voids can be deduced from the study of non - linear late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effects on the cmb @xcite .    ensuring that these constraints are taken into account defines the spatial geometry of the voids .",
    "the chosen parameters are given in table [ tab : parameters - voids ] .",
    "@xmath42 & 4 mpc + @xmath43 & 15 mpc + @xmath44 & @xmath45 + @xmath46 & @xmath47 + @xmath48 & @xmath49 + @xmath50 & 0.6 + @xmath51 & 3.0 +",
    "in order to compare the various universes with dark energy possessing different equations of state , we need to build hubble diagrams which allow us to analyse the discrepancies between models and type ia supernova data .",
    "we therefore obtain the redshift of distant sources situated around the void and then calculate the corresponding distance modulus .",
    "we evolve a single void up to some random time and then choose a random position in the void according to the weighting of matter density .",
    "we assume that the number density of supernovae explosions is proportional to the density and therefore more likely to occur in the void wall .",
    "we follow the path of a photon emerging from that void , with initial coordinates @xmath52 , until the value of @xmath53 reaches the present time , @xmath54 .",
    "we then send a second photon , with initial coordinates @xmath55 , until the comoving distance it covered corresponds to @xmath56 . at this point",
    ", we can calculate @xmath57 and thus the redshift @xmath58 .",
    "the luminosity distance is then given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the value of the scale factor today and @xmath61 is the distance between the source and the observer .",
    "we repeat this process , generating a cloud on the distance modulus / redshift plane which takes the form of a blurry line with scatter around the normal @xmath62 relationship in @xmath2cdm .",
    "the aim of the binning process is to gather series of points given by simulations in order to deduct sensible estimates of the error on the redshift and luminosity distance from them . given the redshift range covered by the supernova data , @xmath63 , we choose to distribute the 10@xmath64 data points between 200 bins of width @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : binning ] ) . for each bin obtained , the mean and standard deviation are calculated .",
    "we thus end up with a new series of points and corresponding errorbars which we can now add to the existing known errorbars on the supernovae and see how the cosmological conclusions change .",
    "the type ia supernovae data used in this study are extracted from the union2 compilation @xcite of the supernova cosmology project , which contains 557 sources drawn from 17 datasets .",
    "we base our comparison on the file called `` union2 compilation magnitude vs. redshift table , '' which contains supernova name , redshift , distance modulus , and distance modulus error . to the latter we add the systematic error due to the peculiar velocities of the host galaxies , @xmath66 km / s , converted into a systematic error on the redshift of @xmath67 .",
    "once all data are binned and all errors known , we can compute @xmath68 values for every combination @xmath69 . in parallel , we do the same for all frw universes defined by the same density parameters .      to compute consistent @xmath68 values , we ought to take into account all the errors and uncertainties adding up for each source considered and which can be split into two categories : error on distance modulus , @xmath70 , and binning process uncertainty , @xmath71 , so that@xmath72 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\mu}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\text{bp}}^{2}}.\\ ] ]    error on distance modulus | this first error gathers the variety of measurement errors due to the nature of the sources and the way their luminosity is evaluated .",
    "accordingly to the union2 original paper @xcite , we sum in the component errors coming from the following causes : light curve fitting ( through covariant matrix ) , galaxy peculiar velocities , galactic extinction , gravitational lensing and a floating dispersion term ( for potential sample - dependent systematic errors ) . + all these errors",
    "are included in the error on distance modulus given by the union2 compilation data .",
    "binning process uncertainty | the second group of errors relate to the spread induced by the voids themselves .    here",
    "the error comes from the binning process itself , where we combine results of simulation for a large number of different sets of initial conditions . for each bin created at a given redshift @xmath73 ( see subsection 3.b ) , we determine the standard deviation of the data by evaluating the spans from the mean value that include 68% of all the points in the bin .",
    "the corresponding deviation , @xmath74 , is then simply added in quadrature to the total uncertainty .",
    "having estimated the errors due to the growth of voids in the universe , we are in a position to find out how this effects the reconstruction of the equation of state . to do this we perform a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) fitting to the data .",
    "we assume a flat universe and generate values of @xmath75 ( and therefore @xmath76 ) and @xmath0 randomly .",
    "for all fits in this paper we remove uncertainty in the hubble constant by choosing the best fit value for each value of @xmath75 .",
    "we also calculate the probability from the @xmath77 values using the @xmath77 cumulative distribution function rather than relative @xmath77 values as an estimation of maximum likelihood .",
    "vs dark energy equation of state @xmath0 when fitting the union2 data set only assuming a flat universe .",
    "the shading represents probability from the @xmath77 cumulative distribution function .",
    "[ snonlyshaded ] ]    first we fit the supernova data alone .",
    "typical favoured regions in the @xmath78 plane can be seen in figure [ snonlyshaded ] .",
    "table [ snonly ] shows the projected constraints on the equation of state with and without the presence of the additional error due to voids .",
    "we have done mcmc runs for the supernova data sets with various minimum redshifts .",
    "when fitting to data , it is normal to cut out very small redshift supernova since they are the data points most vulnerable to large redshift errors such as peculiar velocities .",
    "given that we expect the void effect to be at most the same magnitude as these other errors , we perform fits to the data with and without the voids neglecting supernovae below different minimum redshifts - @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "as expected , the discrepancy between the simulations with and without voids decreases as we increase the minimum redshift .",
    "the constraint on the value of @xmath0 when only including the supernova data is very weak and best fit values are quite far from @xmath81 .",
    "this regime is therefore far from the region of validity of our analysis - the growth of voids in such a universe might be quite different to the ltb case due to structure formation in the dark energy and anisotropic pressure which in general is a challenge to calculate .",
    "however , we make no apologies for this as we only seek to highlight the possible magnitude of void effects upon the reconstruction of the equation of state in this work .",
    ".the best fit for the equation of state of dark energy @xmath0 to the union2 supernova data set alone with the 67% errors .",
    "the fits are done for different minimum redshifts and with and without the additional errors created by the presence of voids .",
    "the fourth column is the difference between the two best fit values .",
    "note the general trend of the difference in errors going down as we cut out lower redshift supernovae ( apart from when we go from @xmath82 to @xmath83 which must be a statistical fluctuation ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     even with the extra degree of freedom , the fits obtained when including the whole set of supernovae down to arbitrai;y small redshifts are not fantastic , the probability obtained from the @xmath77 distribution of the best fit point in parameter space being less than 50% .",
    "however , the situation changes dramatically depending on the redshift considered for the cut - off : the best fit probability comes close to 1 with @xmath84 .",
    "[ fig : dynamicw ] shows the contour plots obtained for the different values of @xmath85 studied here .",
    "versus @xmath86 , with @xmath87 respectively , when fitting the union2 data set , baryonic acoustic oscillations and the shift parameter and acoustic scale of the cmb , always assuming a flat universe .",
    "the contours correspond to the probabilities listed in the individual graph titles.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus @xmath86 , with @xmath87 respectively , when fitting the union2 data set , baryonic acoustic oscillations and the shift parameter and acoustic scale of the cmb , always assuming a flat universe .",

    "the contours correspond to the probabilities listed in the individual graph titles.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is clear again that if we include the lowest redshift supernovae , the error which is introduced due to the presence of voids has a considerbale impact on the best - fitting regions in @xmath88 parameter space .",
    "there are more than 100 supernovae below @xmath89 in the union2 data set so it is not surprising that including or not including them can have a considerable effect on the reconstruction of the equation of state of dark energy @xmath0 . in the same way ,",
    "changing their error bars changes their pull on the best fit values of @xmath0 .    in this work",
    ", we have shown that the growth of voids in the universe can have a small effect upon the reconstruction of the equation of state of dark energy by inducing scatter into the redshift - luminosity data plane .",
    "if one considers only the supernova data , and we try to constrain models of dark energy with a constant equation of state , the effect of the voids may be relatively large , up to around 10% of the central value of @xmath0 , becoming less as one increases the minimum redshift supernovae included in the fit .",
    "when one includes the constraints from the cmb and from baryonic acoustic oscillations , the magnitude of the effect is much smaller , below the percentage level .",
    "however , the induced error does start to compare with some of the other smaller errors that are considered by the union2 team which are listed in table 9 of @xcite .",
    "this error is not important now and may turn out to be dwarfed by other systematics even in future studies using data from new observational programs .",
    "conversely , one can envisage a situation where it would have an important effect upon the understanding of dark energy and we would need to parametrise and quantify our uncertainty .    if we consider dark energy with an equation of state which is allowed to vary , i.e. @xmath90 , we find that the effect of the uncertainty introduced due to the voids is amplified and the best fit values of @xmath91 and @xmath86 can change around 10% , unless we neglect all supernovae at redshifts lower than @xmath92 .",
    "the magnitude of the errors around these best fit regions also increase significantly .    another approach to understand the distribution of these voids and",
    "their effect is to try and map out the local voids using peculiar velocity flows in an attempt to quantify their effect .",
    "this seems difficult : a redshift of @xmath92 corresponds to a comoving distance of roughly 150 mpc .",
    "the size of typical voids in the universe today is considerably smaller than this , of the order of 10 - 20 mpc in radius .",
    "we should therefore expect many hundreds of voids to be present in this low redshift part of the hubble diagram and it seems impossible to trace them given our lack of understanding of bias and the history of structure formation in the local universe .",
    "what we do know is that there are voids , their gravitational potential may have implications for the reconstruction of @xmath0 and we can in principle quantify this uncertainty .",
