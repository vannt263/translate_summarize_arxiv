    "an approach to measuring the distribution of dark matter in our universe is by using weak gravitational lensing , where light is deflected by mass between the source and the observer . in the case of cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "weak lensing , the paths of photons emitted from the last scattering surface become perturbed by the large - scale structure in the universe amidst their journey to the observer .",
    "this changes the statistics of hot / cold spots size distribution , leading to a change in the local angular power spectrum on the scale of the primary acoustic peaks .",
    "@xcite . since the degree of deflection is proportional to the integrated potential that the photon traverses , weak lensing is a sensitive probe for studying the large - scale structure between the cmb and us .",
    "the clustering properties and statistics of dark matter halos have been extensively studied through simulations @xcite . since these dark matter halos form in peaks in the peaks of the background density distribution , they are clustered more strongly than the background matter distribution  @xcite . although galaxies live inside dark matter halos , the formation processes and their dynamics make the distribution of galaxies non - local and possibly stochastic relative to the halo center , making the clustering characteristics different  @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the clustering amplitude of dark matter and galaxies is called linear galaxy bias .    here",
    "we cross - correlate the galaxy number density from the canada - france - hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens ) @xcite and the all - sky convergence map from planck ( planck xv 2015 , hereafter pxv2015 ) to measure galaxy biases .",
    "similar studies include planck lensing cross - correlated with nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) galaxies , maxbcg clusters , sdss lrgs and wise ( planck xvii 2013 , hereafter pxvii2013 ) , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) lensing cross - correlated with nvss galaxies @xcite , wmap lensing cross - correlated with lrgs and quasar from sdss  @xcite blanco cosmology survey ( bcs ) galaxies cross - correlated with south pole telescope ( spt ) lensing  @xcite , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar maps cross - correlated with atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) lensing  @xcite , wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) selected quasars cross - correlated with spt lensing  @xcite , herschel / spire cosmic infrared background ( cib ) cross - correlated with spt lensing  @xcite , sptpol e - mode polarization cross - correlated with estimates of the lensing potential from herschel / spire cib  @xcite , polarbear experiment cmb polarization cross - correlated with herschel / spire cib  @xcite and reconstructed convergence from actpol cross - correlated with cib measurements from planck  @xcite . in our study , we present both the cross - correlations between galaxy overdensity and lensing , and the galaxy auto - correlations using the _ same _ galaxy data , and compare the linear galaxy biases that we obtain .    in this paper we assume flat @xmath9cdm cosmology @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",

    "the second term in equation [ eq : g_kernel ] is the magnification bias , where the observed number density of galaxies are altered due to lensing caused by mass between the foreground galaxy and the observer @xcite is given by : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 for a galaxy sample with limiting magnitude @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : dndz ] , the amplitudes of the magnification biases for each sample are significantly smaller than the @xmath26 term .",
    "the cross - spectrum between convergence and galaxy overdensity under the limber approximation is the power spectrum weighted by the lensing and galaxy kernels   @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the non - linear matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath29 . as a comparison",
    ", we also compute the galaxy overdensity auto - spectrum given by : @xmath30 the model spectra in equations [ eq : clkg ] , [ eq : clgg ] are computed using the non - linear power spectrum from ` camb ` @xcite and revised ` halofit `  @xcite .",
    "the redshift distributions @xmath26 for each subsample are produced by averaging the individual photometric redshift probability distributions for each galaxy rather than simply using the best - fit estimates for each galaxy .",
    "in this study , we use the galaxies from the cfhtlens galaxy survey .",
    "cfhtlens is part of the wide component of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , which consists of 4 fields centered at 2:18:00 -07:00:00 , 08:57:49 -03:19:00 , 14:17:54 + 54:30:31 , 22:13:18 + 01:19:00 , each ranging from @xmath31 with a total of @xmath32 and full multi - colour depth of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we limit our analysis to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath3 , which is confirmed by @xcite to have a photometric redshift distribution that resembles the measured spectroscopic redshift distribution .",

    "three samples with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 are extracted , resulting in galaxy catalogues with mean number densities @xmath39 per square arcminute respectively .",
    "the lower magnitude cut is applied to reduce dispersion and bias due to photometric redshift estimates in addition to removal of possible stars that passed through initial reduction pipeline classifications ( ` star_flag `  @xmath40 and ` mask  ` @xmath40 , descriptions of each flag can be found in @xcite ) .    using these catalogues , the fractional galaxy overdensity maps at arcminute resolution",

    "field regions were extracted by multiplying this all - sky mask with galaxy catalogue masks .",
    "biases in the lensing reconstruction due to the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) effect or cosmic infra - red background ( cib ) fluctuations are expected to be small with planck s angular resolution  @xcite .",
    "the cross - power spectrum is calculated using the flat - sky approximation and multiplying the maps in fourier space : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the normalization factor @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the fourier transforms of the convergence and the galaxy overdensity maps multiplied with the weight map .",
    "the auto - spectrum is calculated in a similar way but replacing @xmath55 with @xmath54 and subtracting the shot noise contribution @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the average number density of galaxies per steradian .",
    "uncertainties are calculated by cross - correlating the galaxy maps with 100 simulated planck convergence maps ( released by the planck collaboration ) reduced through the same pipeline , and calculating the variance for each bin .",
    "using these uncertainties , the weighted averages for each individual bin are calculated .    since the uncertainties in the galaxy auto - spectrum can not be derived in the same way , we resort to an internal block - jackknife method often used in 2-point correlation function analysis , where we divide each of the fields into 64 sub - regions and the jackknife samples",
    "are then created by omitting each of these sub - samples @xcite .",

    "2012 ) , optically - selected galaxies in these magnitude ranges on average are _ unbiased _ tracers of dark matter fluctuations .",
    "we have presented the results of cross - correlations between galaxy number density from cfhtlens and cmb lensing convergence from planck , along with galaxy - galaxy auto - correlations .",
    "we obtain the dark matter - galaxy bias using these two _ independent _ methods . for the cross - correlations of the 3 magnitude samples , we obtain best fit biases of @xmath4 in the range of @xmath86 using the 2015 release and @xmath8 using the 2013 release . from the galaxy auto - correlations ,",
    "we obtain biases of @xmath87 , which settle between the values obtained from the two data releases and agrees well with previously established results that indicate linear galaxy bias of @xmath88 at large scales ( see for example gaztanaga & frieman 1994 ) .",
    "although the galaxy - galaxy auto - correlations place stronger constraints on the value of the bias , these cross - correlations provide a more direct measurement of the relationship between galaxies and two - dimensional projected mass , because the degree of photon path deflection is directly correlated with the depths of foreground gravitational potentials that it passes through .",
    "furthermore , cross - correlations are less sensitive to the complexity of survey masks and any hidden systematic errors that could be present in any single survey .",
    "the power of cross - correlations is yet to be used at full potential . with the advent of upcoming wide galaxy surveys probing to fainter magnitudes",
    ", the sky coverage will improve the statistics while the depth will provide sufficient galaxy number density to maintain signal above shot - noise .",
    "for example , similar cross - correlation analyses will be performed between the dark energy survey ( des ) galaxies - spt / sptpol lensing and hyper supreme camera ( hsc ) survey galaxies - act / actpol lensing , which will have several thousand square degrees of overlap . with such large areas and fainter magnitude limits , the signal to noise",
    "is expected to be an order of magnitude larger .",
