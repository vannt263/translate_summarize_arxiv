    "the neutral hydrogen in the environment of galaxies and galaxy groups is morphologically and kinematically complex . surrounding the milky way are the high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , which are observed in both ionized and neutral states in large complexes including the magellanic stream @xcite , and as smaller isolated clouds , which together cover nearly 40% of the sky @xcite .",
    "possible analogues to the milky way clouds have been found around nearby galaxies including m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite , the m81/m82 group @xcite , and m101 @xcite .",
    "figure [ massdist ] shows for the mass distribution of extraplanar h i  clouds around nearby galaxies .",
    "there are many physical processess that could create hvcs and extraplanar h i  clouds , most of which are likely to contribute to the overall population .",
    "some h i  clouds may be situated in dark halos  clumps of dark matter and gas that have not yet formed stars @xcite .",
    "h i  clouds may also be a product of cold - mode accretion along filaments ( @xcite , kere et al .  , private communication ) .",
    "galaxy interactions can produce filamentary structures of gas and tidal streams like the magellanic stream and the tidal tails of the m81 group @xcite .",
    "some h i  clouds may be the recently accreted by - products of galaxy formation @xcite , or may trace positions of faint dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "some clouds may also arise from a  galactic fountain \" , wherein hot gas created by supernovae expands thermally , cools , condenses and falls back into the galaxy @xcite .",
    "studies of cloud properties such as mass , metallicity , morphology , and kinematics are necessary to distinguish between these possibilities within a given group .",
    "for example , to determine the relative importance of tidal interactions in generating h i  clouds , it is ideal to compare the h i  clouds within nearby galaxy groups that are undergoing different levels of galaxy interactions .",
    "gbt observations of the highly interacting m81/m82 group revealed a population of h i  clouds close to group galaxies , located along tidal streams , and kinematically bound to the group @xcite .",
    "the h i  clouds in the m81 group are most likely byproducts of ongoing galaxy interactions .",
    "the ngc 2403 galaxy group is located along the same filament of galaxies as the m81 group  the ",
    "m81 filament \" @xcite , shown in figure [ filamentfig ] . the ngc 2403 group contains the bright spiral galaxy ngc 2403 , 3 additional large galaxies , and at least 4 dwarf or low surface brightness satellite galaxies .",
    "table 1 lists the properties of the group .",
    "in contrast to the m81/m82 group , the ngc 2403 group is not known to be interacting at all .",
    "although the ngc 2403 group appears mostly quiescent and undisturbed , some of the group galaxies show subtle irregularities which may be due to previous interactions between group galaxies .",
    "the largest galaxy , ngc 2403 , shows a thick , lagging h i  layer and a few h i  filaments with anomalous velocities , which are similar to the m81/m82 clouds in mass @xcite .",
    "these features ma be analogues to milky way hvcs , and their origins are similarly unclear .",
    "these features have been attributed to a combination of outflow from a galactic fountain and accretion from the igm @xcite ; both of these phenomena may be induced by interactions between group galaxies @xcite .",
    "ugc 4305 has a cometary appearance in h i  @xcite , which may be caused by ram pressure from the intragroup medium .",
    "the dwarf galaxy ddo 53 is also kinematically irregular in h i  @xcite .",
    "the other galaxies in the group appear to be normal .",
    "galaxy distances and velocities are taken from @xcite .",
    "we observed the ngc 2403 group with the gbt to map its faint , extended neutral gas and to generate a census of its neutral hydrogen cloud population .",
    "a survey of the h i  cloud population in this quiescent group , combined with the results from the m81/m82 group , allows us to explore the role that interactions play in the formation and evolution of extraplanar h i  clouds .    in sections [ obsec ] and [ datasec ]",

    "we describe methods used to interpret our observations . in section [ knownmsec ] , mass calculations for known objects in the group are presented . in section [ ressec ]",
    "we discuss the properties of the newly detected structures .",
    "finally , in section [ consec ] we discuss the implications of our results in light of recent models of the formation of the milky way .",
    "we observed the ngc 2403 group with the 100 m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the nrao in 9 sessions between 8 june and 1 august , 2008 .",
    "we combined the 9 observing sessions into three maps : a @xmath6 region (  region 1 \" ) containing ngc 2403 , ngc 2366 , and ddo 44 ; a @xmath7 region (  region 2 \" ) containing ugc 4305 , ugc 4483 , and k52 , with an extension to observe the region around vkn ; and a @xmath8 region around ddo 53 .",
    "figure [ filamentfig ] shows a layout of the observations .",
    "additionally , in light of the detection of a cloud at 07@xmath936@xmath1012.1@xmath11 , 67@xmath1233@xmath1325@xmath14 , we re - observed the @xmath8 region centered on the object for an additional 22 minutes .",
    "the regions were observed by moving the telescope in declination and sampling every @xmath15 at an integration time of 3 seconds per sample .",
    "strips of constant declination were spaced by @xmath15 .",
    "corresponding maps were made by moving the telescope in right ascension to form a ` basket weave ' pattern over the region . in the end , each @xmath15 pixel was integrated for approximately 6 seconds except in the region surrounding the large new cloud , where each pixel received 18 seconds .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was used with a bandwith of 12.5 mhz , corresponding to a velocity range of -890 to 1750 km s@xmath5 . the typical system temperature for each channel of",
    "the dual - polarization receiver was @xmath16 20 k.    our observations cover a large angular area ( at least 50 kpc in projection around each group galaxy ) in order to make a complete study of the h i  cloud population and properties across the entire extent of the group , including between major galaxies .",
    "the beam size of the gbt in the 21 cm line is @xmath17 , which maps to approximately 10 kpc at the distance of the ngc 2403 group ; this is well matched to the expected angular size of h i  clouds above our mass detection threshold @xcite .",
    "the gbt data were reduced in the standard manner using the gbtidl and aips data reduction packages .    in order to match our velocity resolution to the expected linewidths of h i   clouds in the group ,",
    "spectra were smoothed to a channel spacing of 24.4 khz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 5.2 km s@xmath5 .",
    "a reference spectrum for each of the 9 observation sessions was made using an observation of an emission - free region , usually from the edges of the maps .",
    "the reference spectrum was then used to perform a ( signal - reference)/reference calibration of each pixel .",
    "the calibrated spectra were scaled by the system temperature , corrected for atmospheric opacity and gbt efficiency .",
    "we adopted gbt efficiency equation ( 1 ) from @xcite with a zenith atmospheric opacity @xmath18 = 0.009 .",
    "velocities are in the kinematical lsr velocity frame .",
    "the frequency range observed was relatively free of rfi and less than 0.3 % of all spectra were adversely affected .",
    "the spectra exhibiting rfi values were identified by tabulating the rms noise level in channels free of neutral hydrogen emission .",
    "spectra that showed high values of rms noise across many channels were flagged and removed .",
    "observations were gridded using the aips task sdimg , which also averages polarizations .",
    "after amplitude calibration and gridding , a 3rd - order polynomial was fit to line - free regions of the spectra .",
    "this baseline was subtracted from the gridded spectra .",
    "the effective angular resolution , determined from maps of 3c286 , is 9.15@xmath19 0.05 . to convert to units of flux density , we observed the calibration source 3c286 , whose flux density is 14.57 @xmath19 0.94 jy at 1.418 ghz @xcite .",
    "the calibration from k to jy was derived by mapping 3c286 in the same way that the h i  maps were produced .",
    "after all corrections for the gbt efficiency and the mapping process , the scale factor from k / beam to jy / beam images is 0.43 @xmath19 0.03 .",
    "the typical rms noise in the final data cube is 25 mk per 24.4 khz channel .",
    "the instrumental parameters are summarized in table 2 , and table 3 gives a summary of the observations .",
    "the mapped regions have projected sizes of 122 @xmath2 367 kpc@xmath20 for region 1 , 245 @xmath2 245 kpc@xmath20 for region 2 , and 61 @xmath2 61 kpc@xmath20 for ddo 53 .",
    "based on previous studies , which found extraplanar clouds within 1 - 50 kpc from the center of a galaxy @xcite , we should detect all of the h i  clouds around group galaxies that occupy the same phase space as the clouds around m31 , the m81 group , and the milky way .",
    "previous studies have found clouds only within 150 km s@xmath5 of the systemic velocity of associated galaxies @xcite .",
    "if these values can be interpreted as a prediction for h i  cloud locations , we expect to find clouds with velocities within a few hundred km s@xmath5 relative to the main galaxies in the group .",
    "spectral maps were made in the entire observed velocity range , from -890 to 1750 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this extends the search more than @xmath19 1000 km s@xmath5 beyond the systemic velocity of any group galaxy .",
    "spectral maps were visually inspected for extended emission not associated with group galaxies and possible new h i  clouds .",
    "the mass detection threshold was calculated assuming that clouds would be unresolved in the gbt beam , using the formula @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the distance to the group , @xmath23 is the rms noise in one channel , @xmath24 is the channel width , and @xmath25 is the number of channels required for a secure detection . for our calculation , we used a h i  cloud linewidth of 20 km s@xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "the 7@xmath1 detection threshold for h i  mass was 2.2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 , adopting the ngc 2403 distance of 3.3 mpc . with this mass detection threshold , we would be able to detect analogues to the most massive clouds around m31 and m33 , the m81/m82 clouds , the m101 cloud , and large milky way objects such as complexes c and h and the magellanic stream .",
    "these clouds are the most likely to originate in galaxy interactions and/or primordial accretion , rather than from supernovae .",
    "figure [ massdist ] shows that if the mass spectrum of extraplanar h i  clouds associated with the milky way and nearby galaxies is representative , we should detect 23% of the extraplanar h i  cloud population in the ngc 2403 group .",
    "the spectral line images are available on - linekchynowe / n2403/ ] .",
    "moment maps of the h i   column density are presented in figures [ mom01 ] and [ mom02 ] and the h i  spectra for the known galaxies are presented in figure [ glx_ispec ] .",
    "the velocity ranges affected by foreground milky way emission are indicated on each plot .",
    "there is some overlap in velocity space between the ngc 2403 group and the milky way , and over this velocity range we can not discriminate between local and distant emission . of the galaxies , only ngc 2403 overlaps with milky way velocities . to estimate the total h i  mass of neutral hydrogen for ngc 2403 , we replaced the velocity channels contaminated by milky way and local high velocity clouds with interpolated values computed from spectral line observations at either end of the contaminated channels .",
    "our calculated values for @xmath27 are in agreement with the literature ; see table 4 .",
    "error estimates on the masses are 1@xmath1 .",
    "the dominant error contribution is the uncertainty in the absolute calibration , about 7% for the gbt .",
    "all of the galaxies in the ngc 2403 group appear undisturbed at the angular resolution of the gbt .",
    "we do not detect the filaments of h i  in ngc 2403 seen in higher - resolution vla data @xcite , most likely due to beam dilution .",
    "three h i  clouds are detected near ngc 2403 and ngc 2366 , labeled numbers 1 - 3 in figures [ mom01 ] and [ mom02 ] .",
    "the clouds are described below , and table 5 lists their properties .",
    "spectra of the clouds are shown in figure [ cloudspec ] .",
    "it is not immediately clear whether the clouds are extragalactic or local to the milky way .",
    "the region mapped is just south of the milky way hvc complex a ( see figure [ laba ] ) , so the clouds may be associated with complex a or other milky way hvcs . in order to distinguish between the two possibilities",
    ", we analyzed the spectra of the clouds .",
    "each cloud is detected in 4 - 6 channels , corresponding to velocity widths of 20 - 30 km s@xmath5 and consistent with both a local and an extragalactic origin @xcite .",
    "if the clouds are located at the distance of ngc 2403 ( 3.3 mpc ) , their masses are 1.5 to 51.7 @xmath2 10@xmath28 m@xmath4 and their diameters range from @xmath16 9 - 25 kpc . if , instead , the clouds are within the distance bracket for complex a given in @xcite , their masses are between 2 - 475 m@xmath4 and their diameters are between 10 - 75 pc .",
    "either of these sets of numbers is plausible : the h i  clouds discovered in the m81/m82 group had masses @xmath16 10@xmath29 m@xmath4 and diameters @xmath16 10 kpc ; likewise , milky way h i  clouds are found with masses @xmath16 60 m@xmath4 and sizes @xmath16 10 pc @xcite .",
    "clouds 1 and 2 are unresolved in the gbt beam . however , the structure of cloud 3 was further analyzed .",
    "the cloud has the cometary or ` head - tail ' structure , velocity gradient , and velocity - dispersion gradient observed in many milky way hvcs @xcite .",
    "these features are all presented in figure [ new ] .",
    "this type of structure is indicative of ram pressure interaction between a moving cloud and an ambient medium , i.e.  the warm gaseous halo of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "if at the distance of the ngc 2403 group , cloud 3 is located @xmath30 90 kpc from any group galaxy , and is far from the outer regions of these galaxies .",
    "it is thus likely that the cloud is part of the milky way , and interaction with the milky way halo is the source of its head - tail structure .",
    "we also compared the velocity distributions of the new h i  clouds , the group galaxies , and the milky way hvcs in the direction of the group ; see figure [ vhist ] .",
    "if the new clouds are part of the ngc 2403 galaxy group , their velocity distribution ought to be consistent with that of the galaxy group @xcite .",
    "the average cloud velocity is -142 km s@xmath5 , separated by 250 km s@xmath5 from the ngc 2403 galaxy group average velocity of 113 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity distribution of the clouds is consistent with the velocity of milky way hvcs in that direction @xcite .",
    "therefore the clouds are likely to be newly discovered compact components of complex a or other compact milky way hvcs rather than members of the ngc 2403 group .",
    "we have observed the ngc 2403 galaxy group with the gbt in order to search for faint , extended neutral hydrogen and h i  clouds . we report detection of three clouds above our 7@xmath1 detection threshold of 2.2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 for sources filling the 9@xmath31 gbt beam .",
    "these clouds are separated in velocity from the galaxy group by 250 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the clouds are consistent in position with milky way hvc complex a and consistent in velocity with all milky way hvcs in the direction of the group .",
    "we conclude that the clouds are most likely associated with the milky way , and that we have detected no extraplanar h i  clouds associated with the ngc 2403 galaxy group .",
    "any h i  clouds in the group must be less massive than 2.2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 , or lie farther than 50 kpc from a group galaxy .",
    "cosmological galaxy formation models predict a population of dark halos ; clumps of dark matter and gas that have not yet formed stars .",
    "these dark halos have not been observed , but @xcite point out that some of the missing dark halos may be the population of compact hvcs identified by @xcite .",
    "the existence of any hvcs associated with dark halos remains in doubt and our observations of nearby galaxy groups are designed to place strong limits on the existence of this class of object .",
    "we did not find any clouds in the ngc 2403 galaxy group with the properties expected for the missing dark halos .",
    "these observations are significant because of the small number of clouds ( none ) detected with the properties expected for galaxy formation based on cold dark matter models .",
    "if h i  clouds indeed form within dark halos , it would be useful to determine how many of these halos our observations should have been able to detect .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a detailed numerical model of the milky way formation based on cosmology , called via lactea ii ( see http://www.ucolick.org/@xmath16diemand/vl/ for more details ) .",
    "the public release of this simulation consists of a table of resolved sub - halos , with the total masses and 3 dimensional positions and velocities . in order to connect their simulations with our observations we require an estimate of the ratio of h i  mass to dark matter . @xcite",
    "have modeled the ratio of gas to dark matter at various densities and under the influence of ionizing photon flux .",
    "their models suggest a range of neutral h i  to dark matter ratios , from 0.015 to 0.0015 , depending on the gas density .",
    "we assume a h i  to dark matter ratio of 0.01 , and compute the number of clouds that could be detected by our observations .",
    "we have taken the via lactea ii simulation and applied our observing selection criteria of mass limits , angular region surveyed and velocity ranges searched , and computed the number of dark matter halos we would detect , if each halo has 1% of its mass in h i  .",
    "we placed their simulated components at the distance of ngc 2403 and at the same relative location as is shown in figure [ mom01 ] .",
    "after applying all observing constraints , we counted the number of objects in the field .",
    "the simulation was performed with the via lactea ii model oriented in 4 different configurations the first configuration placed the via lactea ii simulation components at z=3300 kpc , the distance of ngc 2403 , with velocity 131 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the other three cases simply flipped the positions about the principle axes . in each configuration",
    "there were several dark matter halos that we should have detected in h i  .",
    "an average of 8 components were detected in the simulation configurations , with a range between 3 and 12 components .",
    "the comparison of our observations and this simulation indicates that either the h i  mass fraction of the dark matter halos is less than 0.01 relative to total matter , or the via lactea ii simulation is not an accurate model for the distribution of mass surrounding the ngc 2403 group .",
    "we compare the h i  characteristics of the m81/m82 galaxy group , which is undergoing strong interactions between 4 large galaxies and has a population of large h i  clouds and extended h i  , with the ngc 2403 galaxy group , which is not known to be interacting and contains no h i  clouds and no faint , extended h i  .",
    "many galaxy groups have been searched for analogues to hvcs but none have been detected @xcite , except in galaxy groups with interacting members @xcite .",
    "this paper is part of a larger project to observe h i  clouds in nearby galaxy groups .",
    "we plan to obtain deeper observations of the ngc 2403 group , and are currently observing an expanded area around the m81 group and 3 more galaxy groups that have varying levels of ongoing galaxy interactions .",
    "we will compare this dataset consisting of h i  cloud properties including mass , linewidth , velocity , and distance from group galaxies to compare with the expected properties that result from different h i  cloud formation mechanisms .",
