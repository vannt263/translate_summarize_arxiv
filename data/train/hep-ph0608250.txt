    "in a recent paper @xcite kajantie , rebhan , vuorinen , and myself have proposed a new method for calculating the qcd equation of state in a perturbative setup for all temperatures @xmath1 and quark chemical potentials @xmath2 .",
    "previous perturbative approaches have been limited to certain regions only : when the temperature is large compared to the debye screening mass @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 for @xmath5 colors and @xmath6 flavors ) , hard modes can be integrated out to leave an effective theory for the zero mode , and dimensional reduction applies @xcite-@xcite . in the opposite case @xmath7 ,",
    "a four - dimensional resummation in terms of hard dense loops ( hdl ) works , giving rise to anomalous contributions in entropy and specific heat of a non - fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "the latter approach smoothly connects to the well - known zero - temperature limit by freedman and mclerran @xcite .",
    "our new method covers all of these cases , and provides an independent check on those calculations .",
    "these parametrically distinct regions are suitably visualized in a qcd phase diagram in polar coordinates ( figs .",
    "[ fig : phasediagall]-[fig : phasediagpiv ] ) . due to asymptotic freedom , weak - coupling techniques apply at high temperatures or chemical potentials @xmath8 .",
    "we label the abscissa in figs .",
    "[ fig : phasediagdr ] and [ fig : phasediagpiv ] by powers of the coupling @xmath9 , @xmath10 ,   and the ordinate by parametrically different regimes @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ,   which for larger @xmath14 are displayed as horizontal lines ( somewhat deviating from strict polar coordinates ) . in the following , we will describe the various existing perturbative approaches , and connect them by our new method .",
    "presented here.,width=279 ]     presented here.,width=279 ]    if the temperature @xmath1 is larger than all other dynamical scales , one can apply effective field theory methods @xcite and integrate out the degrees of freedom corresponding to non - zero matsubara modes to obtain a simpler three - dimensional ( dimensionally reduced ) effective theory , known as electrostatic qcd ( eqcd ) .",
    "the effective theory approach can be applied a second time to remove also the massive longitudinal gluon from the theory , thus producing an effective three - dimensional pure yang - mills theory , which is called magnetostatic qcd ( mqcd ) .",
    "practically , the effective lagrangians and effective masses @xmath15 and couplings @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ,   can be obtained by matching a set of physical quantities between a generic lagrangian and the full theory .",
    "the perturbative pressure can then be written as @xcite @xmath19 where the first two terms correspond to the coefficients of the unit operator of eqcd and mqcd respectively , and the last term corresponds to the pressure of mqcd , which constitutes a fundamentally non - perturbative contribution to full qcd .",
    "figure [ fig : phasediagdr ] shows at which orders the latter two terms start to contribute , by the lines labeled eqcd and mqcd .",
    "the plot shows for example that the non - perturbative contribution of mqcd which sets in at order @xmath20 for @xmath21 , only affects the pressure at order @xmath22 if the temperature is of the parametric order @xmath23 .",
    "so far the perturbative pressure has been obtained up to and including order @xmath24 @xcite and extended to finite chemical potential @xmath2 @xcite . the other result depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagdr ] is the zero - temperature limit by freedman and mclerran ( fmcl ) @xcite which is known up to and including order @xmath0 , with an error of order @xmath24 . at order",
    "@xmath0 dimensional reduction diverges as @xmath25 and does not connect to fmcl , revealing obviously the breakdown of dimensional reduction .    in the region",
    "@xmath26 perturbation theory requires a different reorganization which can be most efficiently performed via hdl resummation @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagpiv ] ) .",
    "a small modification to htl resummation increases the range of validity of this approach to larger temperatures .",
    "the interaction pressure @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the interaction - free stefan - boltzmann contribution ) as well as entropy and specific heat show anomalous logarithmic enhancement of the leading contribution ( a signature for non - fermi - liquid behavior ) and fractional powers of the temperature in the regime @xmath26 ( for @xmath29 , @xmath5 ) @xmath30 the fractional powers are indicated by lines starting from @xmath31 and @xmath0 in fig .",

    "fig : tmu],width=264 ]     ( full lines ) and @xmath6 ( dashed lines ) , in comparison with the weak - coupling result for the critical temperature of color superconductivity ( csc ) when extrapolated to large coupling . [",
    "fig : tmu],width=298 ]    our new approach @xcite is motivated by the observation that only a subset of all diagrams that contribute to the pressure exhibit infrared divergent behavior in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "the problematic set consists of the two - gluon reducible diagrams ( 2gr ; vacuum bubble diagrams that can be separated by cutting two gluon lines ) . up to order @xmath0 , the following classes of 2gr diagrams require resummation : where the black dots represent the full one - loop gluon polarization tensor .",
    "this is only known numerically , but the contribution of diagram @xmath33 to the pressure up to @xmath34 can be expressed analytically , and diagrams @xmath35 and @xmath36 would only contribute beyond that order .",
    "only the contribution from diagram @xmath37 has to be obtained by means of numerical integration ( using the methods developed at large @xmath38 @xcite ) . the pressure through order @xmath0 ( labeled by the roman numeral iv ) valid for all @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "is finally given by the sum of analytically calculable pieces and the ring diagrams @xmath37 which have to be integrated numerically : @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig : p05 ] shows that dimensional reduction ( curves labeled @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 ) ceases to be applicable when @xmath40 . at this point ,",
    "non - fermi - liquid effects take over that can only be described by hdl / htl resummation or the new @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmu ] , this separation line @xmath42 is plotted along with the weak - coupling result for the critical temperature of color superconductivity  @xcite . while at larger couplings significant non - perturbative modifications can be expected , at weaker couplings",
    "one observes a clear separation of regimes with qualitatively different weak - coupling descriptions .",
