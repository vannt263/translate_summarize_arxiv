    "multiferroic materials have become of interest for their unusual low - temperature properties in general , and in particular for the observation that one can affect their magnetic structure through an electric field and their electric polarization through a magnetic field .",
    "the most promising candidates for a controllable multiferroic have been found among the materials with inherent geometric magnetic frustration  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of the delafossite cucro@xmath0  have received detailed interest since the discovery of its multiferroic behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this system , which crystallizes in the rhombohedral @xmath7 space group , is a multiferroic compound due to its apparent strong coupling of spin and charge .",
    "in contrast to other multiferroic compounds cucro@xmath0  shows a spontaneous electric polarization upon antiferromagnetic ordering without an accompanying structural phase transition , although a slight in - plane lattice distortion can be measured  @xcite .",
    "further , cucro@xmath0  is a rare example of a system whose magnetoelectric properties are tunable by both an electric and a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "another particular property is that the multiferroic state is already entered in zero magnetic field as opposed to isostructural cufeo@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "several studies of the magnetic structure by neutron diffraction techniques with powder  @xcite and single crystal  @xcite samples have been reported .",
    "the powder experiments found an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector @xmath8 based on the position of the @xmath9 reflection , and a broadening of some of the magnetic bragg peaks which was attributed to short range correlations along the @xmath6-direction , either in the form of quasi 2-dimensionality  @xcite or stacking faults  @xcite .",
    "the measured powder intensities were best described with a proper - screw magnetic structure , although other magnetic structure models could not be unambiguously excluded .",
    "the single crystal experiments , on the other hand , identified the structure as an incommensurate proper screw but the magnetic moments were not refined , and , most importantly , measurements were only reported for ( @xmath10 ) reflections  @xcite .",
    "thus the question of possible ordering along the @xmath6-direction was not considered . in this contribution we will fill these gaps and arrive at the following main conclusions .",
    "the low - temperature magnetic structure below @xmath3 ] is truly 3-dimensional with long range correlations along the @xmath6-direction .",
    "we confirm the incommensurate proper screw magnetic spiral propagating along the [ 1,1,0 ] direction , and find that it has an elliptical envelope with a modulation between @xmath12}$]= 2.2(2 )  @xmath13  and @xmath14}$]= 2.8(2 )  @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore we characterize the spin structure in the intermediate temperature phase between @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( which is not multiferroic ) as 2-dimensional with a total lack of near neighbor magnetic correlations along the @xmath6-direction .",
    "single crystal samples were prepared in two ways .",
    "samples up to 6  mm@xmath15 in size were grown in a platinum crucible from the high temperature solution technique based on the thermal decomposition of k@xmath0cr@xmath0o@xmath16  at 860@xmath17c in the presence of cuo  @xcite .",
    "the mixture of k@xmath0cr@xmath0o@xmath16  ( 73 mol% ) and cuo ( 27 mol% ) was placed into a high density aluminum crucible and heated quickly up to 850@xmath17c .",
    "then the temperature was lowered at a rate of 0.5@xmath17c / h during a period of up to four days before the crucible was quenched to room temperature .",
    "this resulted in single crystalline black hexagonal platelets of up to 6 mm@xmath15 in volume .",
    "larger cucro@xmath0  crystals ( up to 60 mm@xmath15 ) were grown with a flux melting technique based on bi@xmath0o@xmath18 solvent at a temperature between 940@xmath17c and 1250@xmath17c , under conditions of repeating abrupt rise of temperature of 10 - 15@xmath17c with subsequent cooling of 0.5 - 1.5@xmath17c / h .",
    "the trigonal crystal structure ( space group @xmath19 ) with room temperature lattice parameters @xmath20   and @xmath21    @xcite was confirmed by x - ray powder analysis of crushed crystals .",
    "further characterization with respect to their magnetic properties was done using a squid - magnetometer .",
    "the obtained susceptibility curves were similar to data published previously  @xcite .",
    "identifying the same characteristic points in the susceptibility data as kimura  @xcite the same two characteristic phase transition temperatures , @xmath1  k and @xmath2  k , were obtained for our samples .",

    "the unmarked reflections are magnetic .",
    "the inset in the upper right corner shows a section along @xmath23.,width=321 ]    neutron single crystal diffraction experiments were performed on the trics four circle diffractometer at the sinq facility , psi , switzerland , on the hb-1 triple axis spectrometer and the hb-3a four circle diffractometer ( fcd ) at hfir at oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) , and on the cold neutron chopper spectrometer ( cncs ) at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) in oak ridge .",
    "the trics experiment used a single crystal of dimensions 3.5 mm @xmath24 3 mm @xmath24 1 mm mounted in two different orientations : with the [ 00@xmath6 ] direction ( hexagonal setting ) along the @xmath26-shaft of the instrument ( orientation 1 ) and with the [ @xmath27 direction ( orientation 2 ) along the @xmath26-shaft .",
    "orientation 1 gives good resolution in the @xmath5 planes ( @xmath6=const ) , while orientation 2 yields good resolution in the planes orthogonal to [ @xmath27 . for data collection in a broad @xmath28 range a neutron wavelength of @xmath29   ( ge-311 monochromator with vertical focusing @xcite ) was used without collimation between the sample and the @xmath15he single tube detector .",
    "for collecting maps and scans with high resolution a neutron wavelength of 2.32   was used ( pg-002 monochromator , pg filter ) with a 20 collimation in front of the detector .",

    "the @xmath31-values of the scans have been transformed to an orthogonal system using the @xmath32 direction as @xmath33 and the @xmath34 direction as @xmath35 .",
    "additional data were taken with elastic measurements on the hb-1 spectrometer at hfir and on cncs at the sns @xcite .",

    "the neutron wavelength of 2.46   from a pg-002 monochromator was used .",
    "the collimation was 48-60-60-240 with additional pg filters in the incident beam .",
    "the incident wavelength at cncs was 2.60   .",
    "two data sets of nuclear bragg reflections ( 40 and 65 reflections for the orientations 1 and 2 , respectively ) were collected on trics for a scale factor determination at 300 k and at 5 k with @xmath29   .",

    "the correlation length is therefore larger than at least several hundred   .",
    "this result clearly disagrees with the conclusions from the powder diffraction measurements  @xcite ( which were suggesting short range order along the @xmath6-direction ) .    to identify the fundamental magnetic propagation vector ,",

    "the star of the propagation vector consists of @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    to confirm the magnetic structure",
    "a refinement of the two datasets measured at trics , collected with @xmath46=1.178    ( 140 reflections ) and @xmath46=2.32    ( 197 reflections ) has been performed using fullprof @xcite .",
    "three magnetic domains due to the 3-fold axis have been taken into account .",

    "generally the magnetic moment @xmath48 of the cr@xmath49 ion in the @xmath50th unit cell can be described by the generalized helix presentation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are orthogonal base vectors determining the magnitude and direction of the generalized helix and @xmath54 is the phase .",
    "the results for our refinement are listed in table 1  [ table1 ] .",
    "the cycloid models fit the experimental data poorly since they predict small intensities for the magnetic satellites along the wavevectors ( i.e @xmath41,@xmath55,@xmath56 ) .    in reality",

    "this indicates that the magnetic moment is predominantly orthogonal to the wavevector .",
    "the amplitude modulated model agrees slightly better with the data , but the agreement factors are larger than the ones obtained with the  proper helix \" model .",

    "we next discuss the temperature dependence of the magnetic structure .",
    "the magnetic intensity as shown in figure  [ tdeppeaks ] decreases strongly with temperature above @xmath57  k and would be in agreement with a critical temperature slightly below 24  k. however , the magnetic intensity above 24  k is still significant .",

    "figure  [ dirdeppeaks ] shows three measurements for both the @xmath58 and the @xmath6 direction , below @xmath3 , between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and above @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "measured along the @xmath58-direction the magnetic bragg peak loses roughly a factor of four in intensity between 22  k and 24  k but the width changes only slightly .     in the region from 22 to 26 k from measurements on hb-3a .",
    "the two transition temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath3 are marked .",
    "the entire temperature range is shown as inset.,width=321 ]    at 26  k the magnetic intensity is then close to the background and the intensity broadly smeared as expected above ( but close to ) the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "apparently @xmath3 is not a critical temperature along this direction . in the lower panel of figure  [ dirdeppeaks ]",
    "measurements along the @xmath6-direction at the same temperatures are shown for comparison . here , no sign of a bragg peak can be seen in the intermediate temperature range , whereas along @xmath58 there is still a peak , albeit small , at the same temperature . along the @xmath6-direction one",
    "finds _ diffuse _ magnetic scattering between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , well above instrument background , indicative of a complete loss of the magnetic near neighbor correlations along this direction .",
    "since the measurement uses energy analysis , the magnetic correlations can be considered static .",
    "direction ( a ) and along the @xmath6 direction ( b ) on hb-1.,width=321 ]    the picture becomes clear with an analysis of the temperature dependence of the widths of the bragg peaks .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ tdepwidths ] .",
    "the trend for the peak width along the @xmath32 direction is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ tdepwidths ]",
    ". the width increases at increasing temperatures starting around 24  k. above 25  k it then becomes difficult to fit a peak to the data .",
    "in contrast , the width along the @xmath6-direction as shown in the lower panel of the figure start to significantly increase already above 23.6  k. at 24  k the fitted width is already as large as the distance between reciprocal lattice points .    to summarize ,",
    "the picture that emerges is that cucro@xmath0  enters a truly 2-dimensional ordered state between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , with well developed long range correlations in the @xmath5 plane but a lack of correlation in the @xmath6-direction . only below @xmath3 a 3-dimensional ordering",
    "is established .",

    "the width of the bragg peaks along @xmath6 diverges approx .",
    "1  k below the temperature at which it diverges along @xmath32.,width=321 ]",
    "the new single crystal diffraction data and our analysis show that the low temperature magnetic ordering of cucro@xmath0  is fully 3-dimensional and can be described as a incommensurate proper helix propagating in the [ @xmath59 direction .",
    "moments are in the [ @xmath60 plane .",
    "the envelope of the spiral is slightly elliptic .",
    "the magnetic propagation vector @xmath61 is very close to the commensurate ( 1/3 ,  1/3 ,  0 ) value .",
    "the commensurate case would correspond to the classic 120@xmath17  magnetic ground state of the 2-dimensional triangular lattice .",
    "the cause of the incommensurability of the propagation vector has been discussed earlier , and two different explanations have been proposed : either an in - plane lattice distortion @xcite or interlayer exchange interaction  @xcite .",
    "the latter is in better agreement with the occurrence of 3-dimensional order , although it had been shown that an interlayer exchange has to be relatively small ( @xmath620.2mev )  @xcite .",
    "the maximum ordered moment in our model is @xmath63  @xmath13   which is close to the expected @xmath64  @xmath13   for the cr@xmath49 ion and the reported values from the powder measurements   @xcite .",
    "an additional uncertainty for the absolute moment value from the single crystal measurements comes from the non - equal domain distribution .",
    "a cycloidal spin structure can be excluded from our analysis , in accordance with the observation of multiferroicity in the low temperature phase and its explanation after arima  @xcite .",
    "the 3d character of the low temperature ordering is in agreement with the interpretation of the earlier published specific heat data at the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "+ the multiferroic state of cucro@xmath0  is entered without an apparent structural symmetry reduction or lattice distortion . within the resolution of our experiments",
    "the upper limit for change of the lattice constants at the phase transition is 0.001   .",
    "however , evidence for in - plane distortions have been observed in high resolution x - ray diffraction measurements@xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with small structural distortion observed in the related cufeo@xmath0system  @xcite . +",
    "why is cucro@xmath0  not multiferroic between @xmath4 and @xmath3 ? according to the arima model @xcite the in - plane proper screw spiral will create a spontaneous polarization even without the observed 3-dimensional order .",
    "the propagation vector in the narrow phase is the same as in the multiferroic phase and it will be argued in the following why the magnetic structure in the intermediate phase is most likely an in - plane proper screw but without interlayer order . in the light of the 2-dimensional nature",
    "this narrow phase has been discussed as a possible collinear state  @xcite . however , it is unlikely that the narrow temperature phase has a collinear structure .",
    "it has been shown theoretically @xcite that the collinear state is energetically not favored .",
    "also , a collinear state with three sublattices would have a net ferromagnetic moment ( which is not observed ) .",
    "a re - ordering from collinear to helical state is expected to feature a large response in the temperature dependent susceptibility ( which is not observed ) .",
    "similar , an amplitude modulated magnetic structure on a three sub lattice without a ferromagnetic net moment would undergo a discontinues phase transition to a spiral state .",
    "the same propagation vector in both phases with the absence of a net ferromagnetic component and the continuous course of the susceptibility through the transition at @xmath3 indicate that spirals already form at @xmath4 .",
    "the uncorrelated spirals then order through ferromagnetic interlayer exchange to a full 3-dimensional order at @xmath3 .",
    "the question why cucro@xmath0  is not multiferroic between @xmath4 and @xmath3 can not be answered with the results from the diffraction experiment alone since in the picture of the uncorrelated spirals the spontaneous polarization could be averaged to zero .",
    "a possible experiment to clarify this question is neutron diffraction with an applied electric field in this narrow phase .",
