    "little higgs models provide a mechanism to explain a hierarchy between the electroweak scale and a larger , fundamental scale where symmetry breaking occurs through strong dynamics . in this scheme ,",
    "the higgs scalar doublet is a composite particle of the strong dynamics , a pseudo - goldstone boson stemming from the spontaneously broken symmetry at a scale @xmath0 .",
    "the goldstone mechanism protects the higgs boson from acquiring a large mass term , with one - loop quadratic corrections being cancelled by new gauge bosons and partners of the top quark .",
    "a simple implementation of the little higgs concept with a single global symmetry group is the _",
    "littlest _ higgs model @xcite .",
    "however , owing to tree - level contributions of the new particles to the oblique electroweak parameters , electroweak precision data requires @xmath0 to be above 5 tev @xcite .",
    "on the other hand a scale as low as 1 tev is required to avoid fine - tuning of the higgs mass .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by imposing a discrete symmetry , called _",
    "t - parity _ @xcite",
    ". under this symmetry , the standard model ( sm ) fields are t - even , while the new tev - scale particles are odd , effectively forbidding all tree - level interactions between one of the new heavy degrees of freedom and sm particles .",
    "therefore , the new particles can only be generated in pairs , which is reminiscent of r - parity in supersymmetric theories .",
    "besides satisfying the electroweak constraints even for @xmath3 tev , an exactly realized t - parity also leads to the lightest t - odd particle being stable and , if neutral , a good candidate for ( cold ) dark matter .    however , it was pointed out by hill and hill @xcite that typical models of strongly interacting symmetry breaking would lead to a wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite which is odd under t - parity .",
    "the structure of the wzw term can be derived from topological considerations and depends only on the pattern of the global and gauged symmetry groups .",
    "the breaking of t - parity by the wzw term , though suppressed by the large symmetry breaking scale , rules out the lightest t - odd particle as a dark matter candidate , since this particle would decay promptly into gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if the wzw term is a priori the only source of t - parity breaking , the electroweak precision constraints could still be satisfied .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the effect of the wzw term in the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) further .",
    "the relevant interactions induced by this term are derived , and their gauge invariance is shown .",
    "furthermore , it is demonstrated that the wzw term can not be the only t - parity violating operator , but that other t - odd terms are needed in the lagrangian to make the theory consistent .",
    "equipped with these results , we discuss the constraints on the model from lep and tevatron data and comment on the surprisingly rich phenomenological prospects for lhc .    after reviewing the lht model and specifying the notations in section [ sc : model ] ,",
    "the t - odd interactions induced by the wzw term are studied in section [ sc : wzw ] . in section [ sc : pheno ]",
    "the t - parity violating signals at lep and hadron colliders are investigated .",

    "the littlest higgs model is based on a su(5)/so(5 ) symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "a global su(5 ) symmetry is broken down to so(5 ) by a vacuum expectation value of the form @xmath4 for a field @xmath5 transforming in the two - index symmetric representation of su(5 ) .",
    "the generators of su(5 ) are split up into a set of ten unbroken generators @xmath6 that generate the unbroken so(5 ) subgroup and a set of 14 broken generators @xmath7 .",
    "the goldstone modes of the broken generators are implemented in a non - linear sigma model with a breaking scale @xmath0 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the goldstone matrix .",

    "the goldstone matrix @xmath21 is explicitly given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the little higgs doublet , @xmath24 is a complex triplet under @xmath25 , which receives a mass of @xmath26 , and the real triplet field @xmath27 and the real singlet @xmath28 are eaten by the heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath29 is the @xmath14 identity matrix ) .",
    "the littlest higgs model can be supplemented by a discrete @xmath30 symmetry called t - parity @xcite , with sm particles being even ( @xmath31 ) , and non - sm particles odd ( @xmath32 ) under this symmetry .",
    "their couplings to the non - linear sigma fields generate masses of order @xmath0 for the t - odd particles . in the gauge sector , t - parity is realized by the automorphism @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as a result , t - parity interchanges the two sets of gauge bosons , @xmath35 t - parity requires the two sets of gauge couplings to be identical : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the gauge bosons form a light and a heavy linear combination : @xmath38 with masses of order @xmath0 generated from the kinetic term of the non - linear sigma model .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the light gauge bosons mix to form the usual physical states of the sm , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here ,",
    "as usual , @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle .",
    "similarly , a small mixing of order @xmath44 is introduced between @xmath45 and @xmath46 through electroweak symmetry breaking , yielding @xmath47 the @xmath48 will be referred to as heavy photon throughout this text .",
    "it is always lighter than the other t - odd gauge bosons and thus a good candidate for the ltp ( lightest t - odd particle ) and dark matter , if t - parity is an exact symmetry .",
    "note that the mixing between the heavy photon and @xmath49 , is numerically small and leads to corrections at the 1% level at most .    in the scalar sector ,",
    "t parity is defined as @xmath50 such that @xmath23 is t - even while @xmath24 , @xmath51 and @xmath28 are t - odd .",
    "the kinetic term ( [ lag0 ] ) is not the full non - linear sigma model lagrangian but just the first term in an expansion in external momenta @xmath52 .",
    "the higher order terms that have to be added to ( [ lag0 ] ) to cancel divergencies that appear in perturbation theory are suppressed by powers of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the intrinsic cutoff of the theory beyond which ordinary perturbation theory breaks down .    in little higgs models",
    "@xmath55 is typically of the order of @xmath56  tev , and the phenomenology at the tev scale is well described by ( [ lag0 ] ) .",
    "exceptions are possible if the lowest order lagrangian possesses more symmetries than the full model . in that case",
    "higher order terms have to be taken into account and may change the phenomenology significantly .",
    "t - parity also requires a doubling of the left - chiral fermion sector .",
    "each left - handed t - even ( sm ) fermion is accompanied by a t - odd partner @xmath57 ( mirror fermion ) with mass @xcite @xmath58 where the yukawa couplings @xmath59 can in general depend on the fermion species @xmath60 .",
    "the implementation of the mass terms for the mirror fermions also introduces t - odd su(2)-singlet fermions , which may receive large masses and do not mix with the su(2)-doublets @xmath57 .",
    "here it is therefore assumed that these extra singlet fermions are too heavy to be observable at current or next - generation collider experiments .",
    "the top sector requires an additional t - even fermion @xmath61 and one t - odd fermion @xmath62 to cancel quadratic divergencies to the higgs mass .",

    "the wzw term is t - odd by construction , i.e. it changes sign under a t - parity transformation .",
    "the fact that @xmath72 violates t - parity and that its coefficient @xmath70 can not be chosen arbitrarily make the wzw term stand out from other higher order terms in the expansion of the non - linear sigma model lagrangian .    in those cases where the uv completion demands a nonzero @xmath70 ,",
    "t - parity can not be a fundamental symmetry of the full theory , instead it has to be seen as accidental symmetry of the lowest order effective lagrangian .",

    "various options to cancel the anomaly are discussed in @xcite .",
    "one possible way to to cancel the anomaly directly at the level of the underlying ultracolor theory is by introducing a set of spectator leptons with @xmath77 and @xmath78 charges chosen such that they directly cancel the anomalies from the ultrafermions .",
    "making the spectator leptons sufficiently heavy allows one to neglect their contributions to physical observables , without affecting the anomaly cancellation .",

    "the three gauge boson terms with one t - odd gauge boson are of the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is any t - odd gauge boson and @xmath81 denote sm gauge bosons .",
    "independent of the actual implementation , any anomaly canceling sector does at least cancel all these terms",
    ".    there could be additional effects from the anomaly canceling sector that do depend on the details of its implementation .",

    ", the leading t - odd interactions now appear at order @xmath82 in the expansion of @xmath72 .",
    "for example three gauge boson interactions with two sm gauge bosons and one t - odd gauge boson are generated by @xmath83 once electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "the systematic expansion of @xmath72 leads to a large number of t - parity violating interactions . to leading order in @xmath84 the part of the wzw term containing one neutral t - odd gauge boson",

    "we do not write other parts of the wzw term here , instead all t - violating vertices with up to four legs have been tabulated in appendix [ sec : feynrules ] , including the interactions of the complex triplet @xmath24 .",
    "these feynman rules have further been implemented into a model file for calchep 2.5 @xcite .",
    "because of ( [ wzw1 ] ) the heavy photon can decay either into a pair of @xmath93-bosons or into a @xmath94 pair , with a decay width of order @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "this clearly rules out the @xmath48 as dark matter candidate . a more detailed analysis , in particular for the case where the decay into real sm gauge bosons is kinematically forbidden ,",
