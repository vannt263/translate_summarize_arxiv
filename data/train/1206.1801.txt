    "the function @xmath8 , defined by ( [ zeta ] ) for @xmath9 , admits of analytic continuation over the whole complex plane having as its only singularity a simple pole with residue 1 at @xmath10 ( @xcite , p . 1 - 3 ) .",
    "the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) , stated by riemann in 1859 , concerns the complex zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the rh states that the non - real zeros of the riemann zeta function @xmath8 all lie on the line at @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .    during a study of the riemann zeta - function ,",
    "observing its graphs and looking for some relation between the rh and the size of the riemann zeta function , an interesting problem arises to estimate its size in the critical strip ; i.e. @xmath0 in the strip @xmath12 . to do this",
    "we employ a method of power inequalities related to some infinite product for @xmath13 and euler s gamma - function instead of the use of stirling s asymptotic formula ( see @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the main result of this note is stated by the following    [ theorem 1 ] let @xmath5 , where @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath15 where the equality takes place only if @xmath16 .",
    "in order to prove this theorem , we will need some auxiliary elementary inequalities involving rational and logarithmic functions . precisely ,",
    "we have ( see . @xcite ,  2 ) @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20    next we give some possibly new inequalities whose proofs are based on elementary calculus .    for any @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 finally , for @xmath24 @xmath25 where the equality holds only if @xmath26 or @xmath27 , and @xmath28 @xmath29 where it becomes equality only if @xmath26 .",
    "+    in order to prove ( [ 1 + 1/tx ] ) , we let @xmath30 then its derivative has the form @xmath31 calling inequality ( [ log(1+x)1 ] ) , it is easily seen that @xmath32 . therefore @xmath33 is decreasing and @xmath34 .",
    "hence @xmath35 for @xmath36 . to verify ( [ 1+x / t ] ) , observe that conditions @xmath21 and @xmath37 imply the positiveness of both sides of the inequality , which is equivalent to @xmath38 hence , denoting the left - hand side of the latter inequality by @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 since @xmath41 , then @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the equality in ( [ 1+x / t ] ) holds for @xmath44 or @xmath45 . to prove ( [ ( 1 + 1/x)a 1 ] )",
    ", we replace @xmath46 in ( [ 1 + 1/tx ] ) .",
    "the proof of ( [ ( 1 + 1/x)a 2 ] ) and ( [ ( 1 + 1/x)a 3 ] ) is straightforward and similar , invoking with inequalities ( [ log(1+x)3 ] ) and ( [ log(1+x)4 ] ) .    let @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ". then + @xmath50 @xmath51 if @xmath52 , it has @xmath53 finally , for @xmath54 , the following inequality holds @xmath55    let @xmath56 . then ( [ 2x+1-s ] ) is equivalent to @xmath57 it is not difficult to verify @xmath58 but relation ( [ 2x+1-s y ] ) is just inequality ( [ 1+x / t ] ) where @xmath59 so we proved ( [ 2x+1-s ] ) . in the same manner",
    "we establish ( [ 1-s / s ] ) .",
    "to prove ( [ 1-s / s prod ] ) it is enough to verify the following inequality @xmath60 its left - hand side is increasing by @xmath6 and decreasing by @xmath7 in the strip @xmath610,1/2[\\times]1/2,\\infty[$ ] .",
    "therefore , we may put @xmath62 and @xmath63 and see by straightforward computation that it is less than @xmath64 .",
    "as it is known , the functional equation for the riemann zeta - function ( @xcite , p. 16 ) can be written as @xmath65 or @xmath66 denoting by @xmath67 we will show that for @xmath68 and @xmath54 , @xmath69 .    taking the infinite product for the sine function ( @xcite , p. 197 ) @xmath70 and letting @xmath71 , we arrive at the known wallis s formula @xmath72 moreover , the gauss infinite product formula for the gamma function ( @xcite , p. 61 ) @xmath73 yields @xmath74 hence @xmath75 we put @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 plainly , for any @xmath79 we have @xmath80 and so @xmath81 hence @xmath82 therefore , it is sufficient to show that for @xmath68 and @xmath54 @xmath83    indeed , @xmath84 is a decreasing function with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "meanwhile @xmath87 is increasing with respect to @xmath6 in the strip @xmath880,1/2[\\times [ 1/2,\\infty[$ ] , and decreasing with respect to @xmath7 in the strip @xmath880,1/2[\\times \\mathbb{r}^+$ ] .",
    "+ denoting by @xmath89 the general term of the product and assuming for now @xmath90 we easily come out with the inequality @xmath91    to verify ( [ h(2.n ) ] ) we need to show that @xmath92 in fact , @xmath93 hence inequality ( [ 1 + 1/2n ] ) yields @xmath94 however @xmath95 so the first inequality in ( [ 1 + 1/2n 2 ] ) follows immediately from ( [ ( 1 + 1/x)a 1 ] ) , letting @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "thus we have inequality ( [ h(2.n ) ] ) .",
    "further , we show that @xmath98 is an increasing sequence for any @xmath990,1/2[\\times\\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "to do this we consider the function @xmath100 and differentiate it with respect to @xmath101 . hence by straightforward calculations we derive @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 since @xmath105 @xmath106 we get that the derivative is positive , and therefore @xmath107 is increasing for @xmath108 . now fixing @xmath52 we justify that @xmath109 is increasing by @xmath6 .",
    "precisely , @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 and we achieve the goal showing that the latter multiplier is positive . but this is true due to inequality ( [ log(1+x)2 ] ) , because it is greater than @xmath113 @xmath114 returning to ( [ h2(s ) ] ) we conclude that @xmath115 is increasing with respect to @xmath6 for @xmath68 and @xmath52 , and by ( [ extension t ] ) it is decreasing with respect to @xmath7 for @xmath68 and @xmath86 . +",
    "since @xmath116 is decreasing by @xmath79 we have @xmath117 as @xmath118 is decreasing by @xmath7 , it is enough to show that @xmath119 and this has been established in ( [ 1-s / s prod ] ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath8 is reflexive with respect to the real axis , i.e. , @xmath120 , inequality ( [ main ] ) holds also for @xmath121 .",
    "theorem [ theorem 1 ] is proved .",
    "a computer simulation shows that the main result is still valid for @xmath1226.5 , 12[$ ] ( see figure [ b ] ) .",
    "however , a direct proof by this approach is more complicated , because to achieve the goal we should increase a number @xmath79 of terms in the product ( [ hn(s ) ] ) .     for @xmath123,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "here as in @xcite one can announce the following proposition .",
    "as it is known @xcite , zeros of the derivative @xmath125 of riemann s zeta - function are connected with the behavior of zeros of @xmath8 itself . indeed ,",
    "speiser s theorem @xcite states that the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) is equivalent to @xmath125 having no zeros on the left of the critical line .",
