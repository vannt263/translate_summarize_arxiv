    "laminar hagen  poiseuille and electro - osmotic flows are important to microfluidics and a variety of lab - on - a - chip applications  @xcite and the rapid development of micro and nano fabrication techniques is putting even more emphasis on flow in channels with a variety of shapes depending on the fabrication technique in use . as an example the list of different geometries includes rectangular channels obtained by hot embossing in polymer wafers , semi - circular channels in isotropically etched surfaces , triangular channels in koh - etched silicon crystals , gaussian - shaped channels in laser - ablated polymer films , and elliptic channels in stretched soft polymer pdms devices  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce our recent attempts  @xcite in giving a general account for the mass and charge transport coefficients for an electrolyte in a micro or nanochannel of arbitrary cross sectional shape . to further motivate this work",
    "we emphasize that the flow of electrolytes in the presence of a zeta potential is a scenario of key importance to lab - on - a - chip applications involving biological liquids / samples in both microfluidic  @xcite and nanofluidic channels  @xcite .",
    "the general steady - state flow problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where pressure gradients and electro - osmosis ( eo ) are playing in concert  @xcite .",
    "we consider a long , straight channel of length @xmath3 having a constant cross section @xmath4 of area @xmath1 and boundary @xmath5 of length @xmath6 .",
    "for many purposes it is natural to introduce a single characteristic length scale    @xmath7    which in the context of hydrodynamics is recognized as half the hydraulic diameter .",
    "indeed , for a circle of radius @xmath8 this gives @xmath9 .",
    "the channel contains an incompressible electrolyte , which we for simplicity assume to be binary and symmetric , i.e. , containing ions of charge @xmath10 and @xmath11 and equal diffusivities @xmath12 .",
    "the electrolyte has viscosity @xmath13 , permittivity @xmath14 , debye screening length @xmath15 , and bulk conductivity @xmath16 and at the boundary @xmath5 it has a zeta potential @xmath17 .",
    "the laminar , steady - state transport of mass and charge is driven by a linear pressure drop @xmath18 and a linear voltage drop @xmath19 . with these definitions flow will be in the positive @xmath20 direction . in the linear - response regime",
    "the corresponding volume flow rate @xmath21 and charge current @xmath22 are related to the driving fields by @xmath23 where , according to onsager relations  @xcite , @xmath24 is a symmetric , @xmath25 , two - by - two conductance matrix . in the following",
    "we introduce the characteristic conductance elements    @xmath26    which is the well - known result for a channel of circular cross section of radius @xmath27 .",
    "in the following we summarize our results for the transport coefficients accompanied by more heuristic arguments before we in the subsequent sections offer more detailed calculations .",
    "the upper diagonal element is the hydraulic conductance or inverse hydraulic resistance which to a good approximation is given by @xmath28 while there is no intrinsic length scale influencing @xmath29 , the other elements of @xmath24 depend on the debye screening length @xmath15 .",
    "this length can be comparable to and even exceed the transverse dimensions in nano - channels  @xcite , in which case the off - diagonal elements may depend strongly on the actual cross - sectional geometry .",
    "however , for thin debye layers with a vanishing overlap the matrix elements @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are independent of the details of the geometry . for a free electro - osmotic flow , a constant velocity field @xmath33",
    "is established throughout the channel , except for in the thin debye layer of vanishing width .",
    "hence @xmath34 and    @xmath35    from ohm s law @xmath36 it follows that @xmath37    for strongly overlapping debye layers we shall see that in general    @xmath38    we emphasize that the above results are generally valid for symmetric electrolytes as well as for asymmetric electrolytes .",
    "we also note that the expressions agree fully with the corresponding limits for a circular cross section and the infinite parallel plate system , were explicit solutions exist in terms of bessel functions  @xcite and cosine hyperbolic functions  @xcite , respectively . from the corresponding resistance matrix",
    "@xmath39 we get the hydraulic resistance    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the debye - layer correction factor to the hydraulic resistance . in the two limits we have @xmath42    for @xmath17 going to zero @xmath43 vanishes and",
    "we recover the usual result for the hydraulic resistance .",
    "for the system illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , an external pressure gradient @xmath44 and an external electrical field @xmath45 is applied .",
    "there is full translation invariance along the @xmath20 axis , from which it follows that the velocity field is of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 . for the equilibrium potential and the corresponding charge density we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we will use the dirac _ bra - ket _ notation  @xcite which is mainly appreciated by researchers with a background in quantum physics , but as we shall see it allows for a very compact , and in our mind elegant , description of the present purely classical transport problem . in the following functions @xmath50 in the domain @xmath4 are written as @xmath51 with inner products defined by the cross - section integral @xmath52 from the navier  stokes equation it follows that the velocity of the laminar flow is governed by the following force balance  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the 2d laplacian and @xmath55 corresponds to the unit function , i.e. @xmath56 . the first term is the force - density from the pressure gradient , the second term is viscous force - density , and the third term is force - density transferred to the liquid from the action of the electrical field on the electrolyte ions . the equilibrium potential @xmath57 and the charge density @xmath58 are related by the poisson equation @xmath59 the velocity @xmath60 is subject to a no - slip boundary condition on @xmath5 while the equilibrium potential @xmath57 equals the zeta potential @xmath17 on @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , we also need a statistical model for the electrolyte , and in the subsequent sections we will use the boltzmann model where the equilibrium potential @xmath57 is governed by the poisson  boltzmann equation .",
    "however , before turning to a specific model we will first derive general results which are independent of the description of the electrolyte .",
    "we first note that because eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) is linear we can decompose the velocity as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the hagen  poiseuille pressure driven velocity governed by @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the electro - osmotic velocity given by @xmath65 the latter result is obtained by substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq : ns ] ) . the upper diagonal element in @xmath24",
    "is given by @xmath66 which may be parameterized according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g11_alpha ] ) .",
    "the upper off - diagonal element is given by @xmath67 and combined with the onsager relation we get @xmath68 where we have used that @xmath69 and introduced the average potential @xmath70 .",
    "there are two contributions to the lower diagonal element @xmath32 ; one from migration , @xmath71 , and one from electro - osmotic convection of charge , @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 where the electrical conductivity @xmath74 depends on the particular model for the electrolyte .",
    "for thin non - overlapping debye layers we note that @xmath75 so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : g12_general ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g12thin ] ) and , similarly since the induced charge density is low , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g22_general ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g22thin ] ) . for strongly overlapping debye layers",
    "the weak screening means that @xmath76 approaches @xmath17 so that the off - diagonal elements @xmath25 and the @xmath77 part of @xmath32 vanish entirely . in",
    "the following we consider a particular model for the electrolyte and calculate the asymptotic suppression as a function of the debye screening length @xmath15 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",

    "hckel approximation while more general results beyond that approximation can be found in ref .",

    "hckel approximation the equilibrium potential @xmath57 is governed by the linearized poisson ",

    "hckel approximation is valid in the limit @xmath81 where thermal energy dominates over electrostatic energy . since we consider an open system connected to reservoirs at both ends of the channel we are able to define a bulk equilibrium concentration in the reservoirs even in the limit of strongly overlapping debye layers inside the channel .",
    "thus , strongly overlapping debye layers do in this case not violate the underlying assumptions of the poisson ",

    "the hilbert space of real functions on @xmath4 is defined by the inner product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inner ] ) and a complete , countable set @xmath82 of orthonormal basis functions , i.e. , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the kronecker delta . as our basis functions we choose the eigenfunctions @xmath82 of the helmholtz equation with a zero dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath5 , @xmath85 the eigenstates of eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows as an example the 7 lowest eigenstates @xmath88 in a particular geometry . with this complete basis",
    "any function in the hilbert space can be written as a linear combination of basis functions . in the following",
    "we write the fields as    @xmath89    the linear problem is now solved by straightforward bra - ket manipulations from which we identify the coefficients as    @xmath90      the flow rate and the electrical current are conveniently written as    @xmath91    where the second relation is the linearized nernst ",

    "the ratio @xmath94 is consequently a measure of the relative area occupied by @xmath88 satisfying the sum - rule @xmath95 .",
    "we note that as expected @xmath24 obeys the onsager relation @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , using that @xmath96 ^ 2 }   = -\\frac{\\lambda_d}{2 }   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda_d}\\frac{1}{1+(\\kappa_n\\lambda_d)^2},\\ ] ] we get the following bound between the off - diagonal elements @xmath25 and the lower diagonal element @xmath32 , @xmath97        in analogy with ref .",
    "@xcite we define a geometrical correction factor @xmath98 which from eq .",

    "we numerically justify that the smallest dimensionless eigenvalue @xmath105 is of the order @xmath106 , so we may approximate the sum by a factor of unity , see table  [ tab:1 ] . if we furthermore use that @xmath107 we arrive at eq .",
    "( [ eq : g12thin ] ) for @xmath108 .",
    "these results for the off - diagonal elements are fully equivalent to the helmholtz  smoluchowski result  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath32 we use that @xmath109^{-2}= { \\cal o}[(\\kappa_n\\lambda_d)^2]$ ] , thus we may neglect the second term , whereby we arrive at eq .",

    "@xmath110 we may use the result @xmath104^{-1}=(\\kappa_n\\lambda_d)^{-2}+{\\cal o } [ ( \\kappa_n \\lambda_d)^{-4}]$ ] which together with @xmath107 gives eq .",

    "it can be shown that  @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the @xmath113th modified bessel function of the first kind , and were we have explicitly introduced the variable @xmath114 to emphasize the asymptotic dependence in eq .",

    "we note that we recover the limits in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g12thin ] ) and ( [ eq : g12strong ] ) for @xmath108 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "only few geometries allow analytical solutions of both the helmholtz equation and the poisson equation .",
    "the circle is of course among the most well - known solutions and the equilateral triangle is another example . however , in general the equations have to be solved numerically , and for this purpose we have used the commercially available finite - element software comsol multiphysics  @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the results of finite - element simulations for a particular geometry .",
    "the first eigenstate of the helmholtz equation is in general non - degenerate and numbers for a selection of geometries are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "note how the different numbers converge when going through the regular polygons starting from the equilateral triangle through the square , the regular pentagon , and the regular hexagon to the circle .",
    "in general , @xmath105 is of the order @xmath106 , and for relevant high - order modes ( those with a nonzero @xmath116 ) the eigenvalue is typically much larger .",
    "similarly , for the effective area we find that @xmath117 and consequently we have @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "the transport coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ggeneral ] ) to  ( [ eq : ggeneral:4 ] ) are thus strongly influenced by the first eigenmode which may be used for approximations and estimates of the transport coefficients .",
    "as an example the column for @xmath103 is well approximated by only including the first eigenvalue in the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "in fact , the approximation @xmath107 is indeed reasonable .",
    "our analytical results predict that when going to either of the limits of thin non - overlapping or strongly overlapping debye layers , the transport coefficients to a good approximation only depend on the channel geometry through the hydraulic radius @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , when plotted against the rescaled debye length @xmath120 , all our results should collapse on the same asymptotes in the two limits .    in fig .",

    "hckel limit for three different channel cross sections , namely two parabola shaped channels of aspect ratio 1:1 and 1:5 , respectively , and a rectangular channel of aspect ratio 1:5 . in all cases",
    "we find excellent agreement between the numerics and the asymptotic expressions .",
    "for the comparison we have also included exact results , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g12circle ] ) , for the circular cross section as well as results based on only the first eigenvalue in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g12general ] ) .",
    "even though eq .",
    "( [ eq : g12circle ] ) is derived for a circular geometry we find that it also accounts remarkably well for even highly non - circular geometries in the intermediate regime of weakly overlapping debye layers .",
    "we have analyzed the flow of incompressible electrolytes in long , straight channels driven by pressure and electro - osmosis . by using a powerful hilbert space eigenfunction expansion",
    "we have been able to address the general problem of an arbitrary cross section and obtained general results for the hydraulic and electrical transport coefficients .",
    "results for strongly overlapping and thin , non - overlapping debye layers are particular simple , and from these analytical results we have calculated the corrections to the hydraulic resistance due to electro - hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "these analytical results reveal that the geometry dependence only appears through the hydraulic radius @xmath121 and the correction factor @xmath103 , as the expressions only depend on the rescaled debye length @xmath120 and @xmath107 .",
