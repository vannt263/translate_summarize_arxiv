    "the search - cost at a given instant is defined as the position in the list of the next requested object .",
    "the exact and limiting behaviors of the move - to - front rule have received much attention in the computer science and discrete probability literature since the 1960s ( see fill @xcite and jelenkovi @xcite for historical references ) . for a fixed and finite number of objects , the search - cost distribution has been studied by fill @xcite , fill and holst @xcite and flajolet , gardy and thimonier @xcite for different deterministic request probability vectors @xmath3 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the limiting search - cost distribution as the number of objects goes to infinity is known only for the stationary regime of the mtf markov chain .",
    "this problem was first studied by fill @xcite for several types of deterministic request probabilities @xmath4 , and later by barrera , huillet and paroissin @xcite and barrera and paroissin @xcite for random request probabilities @xmath4 defined by normalized samples of positive i.i.d .",

    "a different approach was adopted by jelenkovi @xcite , who considered various scaling limits for the stationary search - cost when the optimal static distribution of objects in the list is specified .",
    "in this article we explicitly compute the limiting law of the transient search - cost as the number @xmath5 of objects tends to infinity , for a large class of deterministic or random request probabilities .",
    "this class includes several previously considered cases . to be more precise , let @xmath6 be deterministic or random real numbers and consider the probability vector @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 we call @xmath9 the `` popularity '' of object @xmath10 .",

    ", we will show that the sequence @xmath21 shares the same law of large numbers behavior and limit of @xmath23 .",
    "this fact is what we call `` law of large numbers for random partitions of the interval . '' with these elements",
    ", we will be able to explicitly compute for all @xmath24 the limiting distribution of the ( suitably normalized ) transient search - cost , in terms of the limiting probability measure @xmath25 .",
    "we will show the existence of an explicit deterministic threshold , depending only on @xmath25 and @xmath26 , such that the limiting transient and stationary search - costs have the same distribution in the event they fall below it .",
    "the limiting transient search - cost restricted to that event will be called `` equilibrium part '' of the transient search - cost , and its distribution ( as well as the limiting stationary one ) will depend only on the law @xmath25 .",
    "alternatively , we will call `` out - of - equilibrium part '' of the transient search - cost its restriction to the complementary event .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the out - of - equilibrium part will depend on @xmath25 , but also on the relative order of popularities in the list at @xmath27 . concretely",
    ", three situations will be studied : ( 1 )  no information at all about the request probabilities is available at the beginning ; ( 2 )  objects in the list are known to be initially arranged in decreasing orderof popularity ; and ( 3 )  objects are known to be initially arranged in increasing order of popularity . in all three cases , we find an explicit expression for the limiting law  of the out - of - equilibrium part in terms of @xmath25 .    as a consequence , we obtain an upper bound for the total variation distance between the transient and the stationary limiting search - cost distributions . the distance from equilibrium at time @xmath26 turns out to behave like @xmath28 in each of the three situations we consider .",

    "we define the mtf markov chain in continuous time and the associated search - cost process following the lines of fill and holst @xcite .",
    "we also recall some nonasymptotic results about its law . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we state our main results , namely theorems  [ theo : principaleq ] and  [ theo : principalneq ] , which provide the limiting expressions for the laplace transforms of the two components of the suitably normalized transient search - cost .",
    "we deduce from them the limiting search - cost law in terms of @xmath25 and its laplace transform .",
    "we also present examples , we discuss connections with the persistent - caching - algorithm introduced by jelenkovi and radovanovi @xcite and we compare our type of law of large numbers asymptotic with the fluid limit considered by jelenkovi @xcite . furthermore , we prove stochastic order relations between the search - costs in the three situations ( regarding the initial ordering ) that are considered . in section  [ sec4 ] , we prove our law of large numbers for random partitions , we discuss its connection with the propagation of chaos property arising in the probabilistic study of mean field models , and we use those ideas to prove theorems  [ theo : principaleq ] and  [ theo : principalneq ] . in the last section ,",

    "@xmath29 means convergence in distribution , and the notation @xmath30 stands for weak convergence of probability measures .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the dirac mass at some point @xmath32 . the convention @xmath33 is adopted throughout .",

    "then , objects are requested at random instants @xmath24 after which the list is instantaneously modified , by placing the requested object on its top .",
    "this is the mtf rule .",
    "it is customary to assume that different objects are requested at random instants given by independent standard poisson processes in the line .",
    "let  @xmath37 denote the intensity at which object @xmath10 is requested .",
    "the total number of requests up to time @xmath26 defines a poisson process , say @xmath38 , of rate @xmath39 by the strong markov property , the probability that object @xmath10 is requested at a given arrival time of @xmath38 is @xmath40 we call this quantity the `` popularity '' of object @xmath10 .",
    "we shall in the sequel work with the time - changed process @xmath41 and its requests instants .",
    "this is the time scale considered , for instance , and in our case it will simplify the asymptotic analysis by keeping a constant ( unitary ) total rate of requests .",

    "that is , in the random variable defined by @xmath49 notice that although the processes @xmath50 are left continuous , @xmath51 is right continuous since the list is modified instantaneously after each request",
    ".    we will further need the following notation :    @xmath52 is the subset of @xmath34 consisting of objects that have been requested at least once in the time interval @xmath53 .",
    "we decompose the search - cost @xmath51 into two random variables : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56    thus , @xmath57 is the search - cost of the requested object if it has been requested at least once in @xmath53 , and it is @xmath58 otherwise .",
    "@xmath59 is defined conversely .",
    "the subscripts @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively stand for `` equilibrium '' and `` out of equilibrium . ''",
    "this decomposition and notation are inspired in fill s work @xcite , where a coupling was introduced which simultaneously updates the list in stationary regime and an arbitrary second list . in that coupling , each object had the same search - cost in the two lists after its first request .",

    "diverging with @xmath5 , the empirical means vanish as @xmath5 goes to infinity .    in these examples , the transient dynamics may be of particular interest , since they exhibit coexistence of microscopic and macroscopic popularities which is likely to affect the convergence to equilibrium .",
