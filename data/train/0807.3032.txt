    "the neutron diffraction measurements were performed on the high resolution powder diffractometer bt1 at the nist center for neutron research using a wavelength of 2.0782  @xmath23 selected by a ge ( 3  1  1 ) monochromator .",
    "the collimation of the incident beam was set at 15.    special attention was paid to maintaining experimental conditions closest to the reported macroscopic measurements and to perform the study under well - defined hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the soft and ductile nature of the compound presents challenges for powder diffraction measurements since flux - grown single crystals tend to smear and shear when ground into a powder .",
    "the effects of grinding are clearly observed as broadened peaks in x - ray powder diffraction measurements , and the modification of physical properties associated with grinding have not yet been characterized .",
    "therefore , as grown single crystals ( @xmath24500 - 1000 ) were loaded into an al - alloy he - gas pressure cell and cooled using a top - loading closed - cycle cryogenic refrigerator .",
    "the pressure cell was connected to a pressurizing intensifier through a high pressure capillary .",
    "hydrostatic pressure was maintained throughout the measurements since the temperature was kept well above the melting curve for helium ( for pressures up to 0.63  gpa ) .",
    "for the temperature dependence studies , the temperature was slowly changed with a maximum rate of 5  k / min while the pressure was adjusted and allowed to equilibrate between measurements .    to reduce the effects of preferred orientation ,",
    "the sample was oscillated over an angle of 36  deg during each measurement .",
    "nevertheless , a degree of preferred orientation remained but was adequately modelled in subsequent rietveld refinements using the gsas software package .",
    "for each diffraction pattern approximately 70 reflections were used to refine the lattice parameters , the z coordinate of the as ions and the 12 parameters associated with corrections for preferred orientation .",
    "we point out that the correction for preferred orientation remained constant over all pressures and temperatures measured and were taken as constants in the fits .",
    "typical r - values ( wrp ) , representing the goodness - of - fit , were between 4 - 5% for all fits demonstrating the accuracy of the model employed .

    "for the spin - polarized and non - spin - polarized calculations , the local density approximation was employed , using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method with the perdew - wang 1992 functional .",
    "the convergence criterion for the total energy was 0.01  mryd / cell .",
    "the calculations were done in the tetragonal phase(two formula units ) for two different cell volumes as the @xmath12 ratio was varied : 0% volume reduction using the experimentally determined lattice parameters and for a 5% volume reduction .",
    "the calculations were also performed for the orthorhombic phase , with @xmath25  =  1.02 , for both 0% and 5% volume reduction .",

    "<S> our results show that the pressure - induced superconductivity@xcite in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 emerges from the `` collapsed '' tetragonal phase rather than the magnetically ordered , orthorhombic phase or the high - temperature tetragonal phase .    </S>",
    "<S> anomalous changes in the unit cell volume and lattice constants have also been noted in the @xmath2feaso system . in superconducting fluorine - free oxygen - deficient samples of ndfeaso@xmath19 , a surprising discontinuous decrease in the lattice parameters and unit cell volume ( @xmath20 ) was found for @xmath21  =  0.4 , where a maximum in the superconducting volume fraction is observed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a correlation between superconducting transition temperatures for @xmath2feaso@xmath19 and the unit cell dimensions is reported@xcite . in light of our results </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that chemical substitution and the introduction of oxygen deficiency likely play a dual role in the iron arsenide superconductors by increasing the charge carrier density and changing the `` chemical pressure '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is not yet clear which has the greater impact upon superconductivity .    given that the @xmath2feaso and @xmath3fe@xmath0as@xmath0 families share a common structural element ( feas layers ) and similar prerequisites for superconductivity ( e.g. suppression of magnetic order ) it is useful to elucidate structural quantities that are shared and can be correlated with superconducting properties . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the comparison of the as - fe - as bond angles@xcite with the ideal tetrahedral value of 109.47  deg . </S>",
    "<S> for this special value all fe atoms are coordinated in ideally formed tetrahedrons with identical high - symmetric fe - as - fe bonding geometries [ highlighted in brown in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry is broken for as - fe - as bond angles deviating from this ideal angle yielding two or three different values in the tetragonal or orthorhombic structure , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the variance @xmath22 ^ 2 $ ] in deviation of the fe - as - fe bonding angles from the ideal value parameterizes the strength of this symmetry breaking .    in figure 3(d ) we plot the measured superconducting transition temperatures @xmath1 , for those iron - arsenide compounds that are superconducting , as a function of this variance @xmath18 of the as - fe - as bond angles </S>",
    "<S> . as @xmath18 increases , corresponding to greater deviations in the bond angle from the ideal tetrahedral angle , @xmath1 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - dependent properties of the `` collapsed '' tetragonal phase of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 described above clearly continue this trend and allow generalizing our result to the family of feas based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the high value for @xmath18 in the `` collapsed '' tetragonal phase for cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is consistent with the low @xmath1 in comparison to other feas based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the observed correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath18 points to the importance of the structure and the symmetry in the feas network for the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> properties that are sensitive to the as - fe - as bonding geometry and its symmetry , such as anisotropic magnetic or elastic couplings in the feas network , seem strongly involved in the superconducting pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> these results highlight intriguing questions that point to the potential complexity of the superconducting state in the iron arsenides . from the analysis of @xmath1 as a function of the as - fe - as bond angle variance </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that superconductivity in the `` collapsed '' tetragonal phase fits well within the general trend observed for the doped iron arsenides , implying a common superconducting pairing mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that spin fluctuations are responsible for the electron pairing in this class of superconductors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent loss of a static moment in the `` collapsed '' </S>",
    "<S> tetragonal phase may seem inconsistent with such a magnetic pairing mechanism for the pressure - induced superconductivity in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strong pair - breaking effect of local moments is eliminated and superconductivity mediated by paramagnons@xcite remains a possibility . </S>",
