    "one of the most important subjects of current study in spintronics is the manipulation of spin and magnetization .",
    "a spin current can modify the dynamics of magnetization through spin - transfer torque ( stt ) ; @xcite conversely the dynamics of magnetization can in turn modify the spin dynamics and may generate a spin current through spin motive force ( smf)@xcite and spin pumping .",
    "@xcite despite the mutual connection between stt and smf , the latter has been shown to be inefficient in generating the spin current due to its weak magnitude,@xcite hence the on - going research on the means of obtaining a large smf .",
    "recently , kim _",
    "et al._@xcite predicted that in systems with large rashba spin - orbit coupling,@xcite the induced smf is more than an order of magnitude larger than the conventional smf .",
    "in such systems , the rashba - induced smf ( rsmf ) can generate large spin current , which in turn can significantly enhance the stt .",
    "however , the requirement of the strong rashba coupling appears to be a limitation of the prediction in the sense that it is hard to increase the rsoc strength in order to enhance the rsmf . in systems with typical values of the rashba coupling @xcite ,",
    "the conventional smf and rashba - induced smf are almost comparable . moreover , in contrast to the conventional smf which can be made time - independent ( dc ) , the rashba - induced smf is not rectified , _",
    "i.e. _ , it oscillates with time ( ac ) .",
    "therefore , enhancement and modulation of the smf over a broader range of rashba soc strength is still essential .    in this study , we propose a method that can significantly enhance the rashba soc spin - motive force , in which a strong rashba coupling is not prerequisite .",
    "the idea is based on the fact that the rashba coupling can be modulated in time@xcite by applying some ac gate voltage ( @xmath2 ) . in such systems ,",
    "the dynamics of both spin and magnetization are controlled by either the rashba amplitude and/or rashba modulation frequency . while the former is a material - dependent parameter limited to its reported values , the latter can be easily modified by external means .",
    "we showed that in the presence rashba coupling that is sinusoidally modulated , the resulting rsmf is enhanced with increasing modulation frequency .",
    "if @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the angular frequency of the magnetization dynamics , the rsmf can exceed that induced by a constant rashba soc .",
    "@xcite therefore , the generated spin current and the corresponding stt can be enhanced by the time modulation of the rashba coupling .",
    "moreover , the rsmf can also be rectified by applying a square - wave gate voltage , _",
    "i.e. _ , the smf is unidirectional , rendering it more useful for practical spintronics .",
    "the conduction electron in a magnetization texture with rashba soc can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vector of pauli matrix , @xmath7 is the effective mass of electron , @xmath8 is the exchange coupling , @xmath9 is the unit vector of the local magnetization , and @xmath10 is the rashba hamiltonian , with @xmath0 being the rashba coupling .    to model the effect of the precessing magnetization and the rashba soc on the electron dynamics",
    ", we adopt the conventional method,@xcite _ i.e. _ , by introducing an unitary transformation @xmath11 . with this transformation ,",
    "the above hamiltonian becomes @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the vector potential and it is given by : @xmath14 with @xmath15 is the non - abelian gauge field associated with rashba soc , which is explicitly time - dependent , and @xmath16 these gauge fields will induce an effective electric field as @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the exchange coupling is very strong so that the spin tends to align along @xmath18 in the lab frame ( along @xmath19 in the rotated frame ) . with this",
    ", the effective electric field reads as : @xmath20 where the @xmath21 is corresponding to the majority ( @xmath22 ) and minority ( @xmath23 ) electrons , respectively . in the above , the first term @xmath24 is the conventional electric field induced by the variation of the magnetization pattern in space and time @xcite in the absence of soc , and @xmath25 which is scaled with the value of the rashba coupling,@xcite and the last term @xmath26 is an extra term being dependent on the time variation of the rashba coupling . in previous works,@xcite",
    "we showed that in a time - dependent rashba system , there is an effective field induced by the time - dependent gauge field , i.e , @xmath27 . for strong exchange coupling",
    ", we have @xmath28 , which recovers eq .  .",
    "remarkably , we can obtain eq .   without the need of the unitary transformation , implying that this electric field can be generated in any magnetization pattern , which can even be static or uniform,@xcite and the driving force in this case is the gate - modulated rashba soc .",
    "therefore , we can electrically control the generation of the total smf via an applied gate voltage .",
    "consider a magnetization profile @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 , and the spatial - dependence is implied by @xmath31 so that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the characteristic length of the magnetic structure,@xcite e.g. , the domain wall width .",
    "this magnetization configuration can be made by assuming that the domain wall ( dw ) precesses periodically between the bloch - like dw and neel - like dw ( see fig.[fig4_2 ] ) . from now on",
    ", we only use this magnetization profile for simplicity . in this case , the above effective electric fields are explicitly given as @xmath34    .,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    where @xmath35 .",
    "it is obvious that the effective in eq .",
    "is independent of time .",
    "meanwhile , for a constant rashba coupling , the field in eq . oscillates with time .",
    "however , since these electric field components depend on both magnetization profile and the rashba dynamics , we may rectify and enhance the spin motive force by introducing a suitable ac gate modulation of the rashba coupling . in following",
    ", we will show that by appropriately modulating the rashba coupling , the electric field induced by rsoc can be significantly enhanced and rectified .",
    "consider a sinusoidal modulated rashba coupling @xmath36 . in this case , the order of magnitude of the above electric field components are evaluated to be @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 shows that one can enhance the smf in the presence of strong rashba coupling of @xmath39.@xcite on the other hand , the ratio @xmath40 suggests that the additional smf component due to the time - modulation of the rashba coupling can have a comparable or larger magnitude if the rashba modulation @xmath41 .",
    "thus , with time - modulation of the rashba coupling , i ) one obtains an additional component to enhance the smf ; ii ) this enhancement is no longer just restricted by the requirement of strong rashba coupling ; and iii ) the frequency of modulation @xmath2 provides another external parameter to control the size of the smf . for example , in systems with rashba coupling such as gamnas having @xmath42,@xcite and assuming @xmath43 nm , @xmath44 , the conventional smf signal comes up to @xmath45 , meanwhile the rsoc smf signal is @xmath46 , which just has the same order of magnitude as the former .",
    "however , upon modulating the rashba coupling at a frequency of @xmath47 ghz,@xcite the new smf signal can be further increased up to @xmath48 .",
    "we shall now discuss the rectification of the rsmf signal which would render it more useful for practical spintronic applications .      .",
    "here , @xmath49 is the amplitude of the smf , where @xmath33 is the domain wall width .",
    "[ fig4_1],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the previous section , we showed that the introduction of rashba soc can induce a large smf .",
    "however , the rashba - induced smf generally oscillates with time , and so averages to zero over time . here",
    ", we will show that , by applying a square - wave gate voltage , one can rectify one of the rashba - induced smf components .",
    "let us suppose the rashba coupling is modulated as @xmath50 , with @xmath51 representing a square wave function [ see fig.[fig4_1 ] ] . in this case , @xmath52 since @xmath53 . on the other hand , by choosing @xmath54 , the sign of @xmath55 vary in step with the magnetization orientation , yielding @xmath56 with a constant sign",
    ". in this case ,",
    "@xmath56 in eq . becomes @xmath57 the above electric field and the corresponding smf is unidirectional , although its value changes with time ( pulsating ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4_1 ] ] .",
    "similarly , we can rectify the smf component in the @xmath58-direction by applying a @xmath59 phase shift to the gate voltage , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath60 .",
    "this rectification effect is similar to that in spin - torque diode effect,@xcite where a dc voltage is generated when the frequency of the applied alternating current is resonant with the spin oscillations .",
    "we have derived the effective electric fields generated by the dynamics of either the magnetization or the electron spin .",
    "these electric fields can drive a charge current and a spin current . in turn ,",
    "the spin current induces a torque on the magnetization through spin - transfer mechanism @xcite , while the charge current contributes a field - like torque.@xcite generally , the spin current @xmath61 and charge current @xmath62 induced by the smf is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the longitudinal electrical conductivity of majority ( minority ) electrons , @xmath65 is the total charge conductivity , and @xmath66 is the spin polarization .",
    "notice that the spin polarization @xmath67 appears in the charge current instead of the spin current .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that electrons with opposiste spins ( parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath18 ) are driven by opposite electric fields [ see eq .",
    "] , thus the spin current is fully polarized regardless the value of @xmath67 . explicitly , the spin currents driven by the spin motive force components given in eqs.- are @xmath68,\\label{eq10a}\\\\ j^{r,0}_{s , i}=\\frac{g{\\mu } _ b g_0 m_e}{2e^2\\hbar } \\alpha_r{\\left({\\partial } _",

    ", the spin current @xmath61 induces a torque on the magnetization expressed as@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the spin density of the conduction electrons and @xmath72 is the saturation magnetization . in the above , the total spin current can include externally supplied sources and smf induced sources . in our case , to examine the feedback effect by smf , we assume that there is no externally supplied spin current , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath73 is induced internally by @xmath18 . recall that in the adiabatic limit the spin is alighned along the magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 , hence , the spin density @xmath71 is also parallel to @xmath75 . therefore , the torque due to the first term in eq .  , @xmath76 , can be neglected .",
    "the divergence of the spin current in eq .   can be decomposed as @xmath77 , where the first term will give rise to a parallel torque which is not interesting as it does not contribute to magnetization switching .",
    "therefore , the torque on the magnetization in eq .",
    "is simply given as @xmath78    similarly , the charge current induces a field - like spin torque in the presence of rashba soc , which does not involve the spin transfer mechanism and just depends on the intrinsic band structure.@xcite explicitly , the field - like torque is calculated as @xmath79    in the presence of the spin torque , the llg equation is modified accordingly to become : @xmath80 where the second term indicates the damping torque that includes all contributions other than the smf contribution , with @xmath81 being the intrinsic gilbert damping constant .      as a pedagogical example",
    ", we first consider the spin torque due to the spin current generated by the conventional spin motive force given by eq .  .",

    "eqs . and are consistent with the results of ref .",
    "[ ] which considered the smf in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "similarly , in the presence of the rashba soc , the stt is modified to be@xcite @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "as the rashba coupling becomes time - dependent , there is an additional smf - induced spin current given in eq .  .",

    "thus , the total torque is @xmath95 .",
