    "progress in the preparation and isolation of highly ordered graphene sheets over the past few years@xcite has led to an explosion of interest in the properties of these two - dimensional electron systems which are remarkably simple , yet rich in interesting mechanical and electronic properties .",
    "one type of graphene system@xcite that is potentially suitable for applications is prepared by thermal decomposition of silicon carbide ( sic ) .",
    "the unique feature of these _ epitaxial graphene _",
    "systems is that they tend to grow not as single layers but as few layer graphene ( flg ) systems .",
    "the layers tend to be electrically isolated to a reasonable degree@xcite because of partially controlled relative rotations.@xcite flg systems on sic can be grown as large area films that are extremely highly ordered , at least locally , and doped by charge transfer from a carbon buffer layer , which is a nongraphitic carbon layer between the sic and the graphene layers .",
    "this paper addresses the distribution of charge carriers across the flg system .",
    "recent measurements of landau level spectra@xcite and angle - resolved photoemission@xcite for flg systems grown on the carbon face of sic show characteristics of decoupled monolayer graphene rather than coupled graphene multilayers . this behavior is likely due to the relative rotations between the layers .",
    "our work is motivated in part by an interest in understanding the confusing@xcite transport properties of these systems , which must be strongly dependent on carrier charge distribution across the weakly coupled layers .",
    "our immediate motivation , however , is provided by recent@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) landau level spectroscopy studies of flg in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "traces of the landau level positions can be extracted from such spectra as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ll_stm ] .",
    "although stm directly probes electronic properties in the top layer of a flg system , there is evidence that top layer properties can be altered , sometimes qualitatively , by correlations with electrons in submerged layers .",
    "if the density in the top layer were fixed , the fermi level would be pinned to one of the landau level energies except at the discrete field strengths which yield integer filling factors when the fermi level is in between landau levels . in practice",
    ", experiment shows the opposite behavior .",
    "the landau levels tend to be pinned away from the fermi energy , an effect that is particularly striking in the field range between 8  t and 10  t. at higher fields , the landau levels split through valley and spin splitting so that even in the field range near 12  t , the split landau levels avoid the fermi energy .",
    "peaks when these can be separately resolved .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 peak positions at finite tip - sample bias can be influenced by tip - sample band bending and by redistributions of charge in the flg system as explained in detail below . ]",
    "the most dramatic effect seen in these experiments is splitting within spin- and valley - split @xmath1=1 peaks in the density of states ( dos ) as they pass through the fermi level.@xcite this peculiar , fractionally filled landau level gives evidence for a correlated - electron state that is stable when the @xmath2 landau level of the top layer is half - filled .",
    "while the precise nature of this state remains mysterious , its formation might depend only on correlations among top layer electrons ; however , if one of the submerged layers is also partially filled under the same tip - biasing and field conditions , then this fractionally filled landau level could depend essentially on correlations between electrons in different layers .",
    "since half - filling does not favor the formation of especially stable states in an isolated layer , the latter possibility appears likely . in the strong - magnetic - field quantum hall regime with",
    "fully formed landau levels only weakly broadened by disorder , correlations are strongest when landau levels are partially filled .",
    "one goal of the model developed in this paper attempts to provide a basis for estimating which layers contain partially filled landau levels as the magnetic field strength varies .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain our model for carrier distribution in a few layer graphene system in which the buffer layer acts as a reservoir for carriers .",
    "we assume that the growth - dependent buffer layer properties determine the position of the fermi energy relative to the dirac point of the bottom graphene layer .",
    "electron - electron interactions are included only at the hartree level .",
    "at zero magnetic field carriers reside mainly in the layers closest to the buffer and the density - of - states in the top layer is small .",
    "when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied , the fermi level tends to be pinned near one of the filling factors ( @xmath3 ) at which the integer quantum hall effect occurs in a graphene layer , implying that charge must be transferred between layers as a function of field . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how an stm tip can be included in such a model .",
    "when an stm tip is introduced to study the electronic properties of the top layer , its carrier density tends to be altered with a sign and magnitude that is strongly dependent on the tip work function .",
    "the stm studies in refs .   show that the top - layer is @xmath4-type for the tip used in those experiments , so that carrier densities peak not only near the buffer layer but also near the top - layer . in sec .",
    "iv , we use this basic theoretical picture to develop a theory of stm landau level spectroscopy in flg , comparing where possible with stm data .",
    "we find that as the sample - tip bias and the magnetic field are varied , charge tends to rearrange to achieve integer filling factors in as many of the flg layers as possible . in sec .",
    "v , we conclude with a brief summary and some suggestions for future experimental and theoretical work .",

    "we model the role of the buffer layer by assuming that its equilibration with the bottom graphene layer fixes the value of @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that the carrier density of the graphene system is sensitive to the microstructure of the disordered buffer layer , and hence to flg growth conditions . for a given sample ,",

    "because a landau level appears precisely at the dirac point in a graphene sheet , a magnetic field causes a peak in the density - of - states to appear at the same energy at which the density - of - states vanishes in the absence of a magnetic field .",
