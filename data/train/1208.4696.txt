    "the recovery problem of sparse vectors from a linear underdetermined set of equations has recently attracted attention in various fields of science and technology due to its many applications , for example , in linear regression @xcite , communication @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , multimedia @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and compressive sampling ( cs ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in such a sparse representation problem , we have the following underdetermined set of linear equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is @xmath14 is the dictionary @xmath15 is and @xmath16.[multiblock footnote omitted ] another way of writing is that a large dimensional sparse vector @xmath1 is coded / compressed into a small dimensional vector @xmath17 and the task will be to find the @xmath1 from @xmath17 with the full knowledge of @xmath7 . for this problem , the optimum solution is the sparsest vector satisfying . finding the sparsest vector is however np - hard ; thus , a variety of practical algorithms have been developed . among the most prominent",
    "is the convex relaxation approach in which the objective is to find the minimum @xmath4-norm solution to . for the @xmath4-norm minimization , if @xmath1 is @xmath18-sparse , which indicates that the number of non - zero entries of @xmath1 is at most @xmath18 , the minimum @xmath18 that satisfies gives the limit up to which the signal can be compressed for a given dictionary @xmath7 .",
    "an interesting question then arises : how does the choice of the dictionary @xmath7 affect the typical compression ratio that can be achieved using the @xmath4-recovery ?",
    "recent results in the parallel problem of cs , where @xmath7 acts as a sensing matrix , reveal that the typical conditions for perfect @xmath4-recovery are universal for all random sensing matrices that belong to the rotationally invariant matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "the standard setup , where the entries of the sensing matrix are independent standard gaussian , is an example that belongs to this ensemble .",
    "it is also known that the conditions required for perfect recovery do not in general depend on the details of the marginal distribution related to the non - zero elements . on the other hand , we know that correlations in the sensing matrix can degrade the performance of @xmath4-recovery @xcite .",
    "this suggests intuitively that using a sample matrix of the rotationally invariant ensembles as @xmath7 is preferred in the recovery problem when we expect to encounter a variety of dense signals @xmath17 .",
    "however , the set of matrix ensembles whose @xmath6-recovery performance are known is still limited , and further investigation is needed to assess whether the choice of @xmath7 is indeed so straightforward .    the purpose of the present study is to fulfill this demand .",
    "specifically , we examine the typical @xmath6-recovery performance of the matrices constructed by concatenating several randomly chosen orthonormal bases .",
    "such construction has attracted considerable attention due to ease of implementation and theoretical elegance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for designing sparsity inducing over - complete dictionaries for natural signals @xcite . for a practical engineering scheme , audio coding ( music source coding )",
    "@xcite uses a dictionary formed by concatenating several modified discrete cosine transforms with different parameters .    by using the replica method in conjunction with the development of an integral formula for handling random orthogonal matrices",
    ", we show that the dictionary consisting of concatenated orthogonal matrices is also preferred in terms of the performance of @xmath6-recovery .",
    "more precisely , the matrices can result in better @xmath6-recovery performance than that of the rotationally invariant matrices when the density of non - zero entries of @xmath1 is not uniform among the orthogonal matrix modules , while the performance is the same between the two types of matrices for the uniform densities .",
    "this surprising result further promotes the use of the concatenated orthogonal matrices in practical applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the problem setting that we investigated . in section 3 , which is the main part of this paper",
    ", we discuss the development of a methodology for evaluating the recovery performance of the concatenated orthogonal matrices on the basis of the replica method and an integral formula concerning the random orthogonal matrices . in section 4 , we explain the significance of the methodology through application to two distinctive examples , the validity of which is also justified by extensive numerical experiments .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is a multiple number of @xmath19 ; namely , @xmath20 .",
    "suppose a situation in which an @xmath21 dictionary matrix @xmath7 is constructed by concatenating @xmath22 module matrices @xmath23 , which are drawn uniformly and independently from the haar measure on @xmath10 orthogonal matrices , as @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{lorth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this , we compress a sparse vector @xmath25 to @xmath26 following the manner of ( [ eq : sparse_representation_without_noise ] ) . we denote @xmath27 for the concatenation of @xmath22 sub - vectors of @xmath19 dimensions as @xmath28 yielding the expression @xmath29 with full knowledge of @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath17 , the @xmath6-recovery is performed by solving the constrained minimization problem @xmath32 where @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 generally denotes the minimization of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath31 . at the minimum condition , @xmath39 constitutes the recovered vector @xmath40 in the manner of ( [ vector_union ] ) .    for theoretically evaluating the @xmath6-recovery performance , we assume that the entries of @xmath41 , @xmath42 are distributed independently according to a block - dependent sparse distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 means the density of the non - zero entries of the @xmath45-th block of the same size @xmath19 in @xmath27 and @xmath46 is a distribution whose second moment about the origin is finite , which is assumed as unity for simplicity .",
    "intuitively , as the compression rate @xmath47 decreases , the overall density @xmath48 up to which ( [ l1_recovery ] ) can successfully recover a typical sample of the original vector @xmath27 becomes smaller .",
    "however , precise performance may depend on the profile of @xmath49 .",
    "the above setting allows us to quantitatively examine how such block dependence of the non - zero density affects the critical relation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 for typically successful @xmath6-recovery of @xmath27 .",
    "expressing the solution of ( [ l1_recovery ] ) as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , constitutes the basis of our analysis .",
    "equations ( [ posterior_mean ] ) and ( [ posterior ] ) mean that @xmath40 can be identified with the average of the state variable @xmath1 for the gibbs - boltzmann distribution ( [ posterior ] ) in the vanishing temperature limit @xmath55 .",
    "however , as ( [ posterior ] ) depends on @xmath56 and @xmath57 , further averaging with respect to the generation of these external random variables is necessary for evaluating the typical properties of the @xmath6-recovery .",
    "evaluation of such `` double averages '' can be carried out systematically using the replica method @xcite .      in the replica method , we need to evaluate the average of @xmath58 for @xmath59 with respect to @xmath60 over the uniform distributions of @xmath10 orthogonal matrices . however , this is rather laborious and is easy to yield notational confusions . for reducing such technical obstacles ,",
    "we introduce a formula convenient for accomplishing this task before going into detailed manipulations .",
    "similar formulae have been introduced for handling random eigenbases of symmetric matrices @xcite and random left and right eigenbases of rectangular matrices @xcite .",
    "let us assume that @xmath19-dimensional vectors @xmath61 @xmath31 are characterized by their norms as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the standard euclidean norm of the vector @xmath64 .",
    "for these vectors , we define the function @xmath65_{\\{{\\boldsymbol{o}}_t\\ } } \\right ) \\cr & = & \\lim_{m \\to \\infty }   \\frac{1}{m}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{\\int \\left ( \\prod_{t=1}^{t}{\\cal d}{\\boldsymbol{o}}_t \\right ) \\delta \\left ( \\sum_{t=1}^{t}{\\boldsymbol{o}}_t { \\boldsymbol{u}}_t \\right ) } { \\int \\left ( \\prod_{t=1}^{t}{\\cal d}{\\boldsymbol{o}}_t \\right ) } \\right ) ,   \\label{formula_def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66_x$ ] generally denotes the average of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath37 , and @xmath67 denotes the haar measure of the @xmath10 orthogonal matrices .",
    "our claim is that by explicitly using @xmath68 , can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 generally denotes the extremization of function @xmath36 with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "expression ( [ formula_concrete ] ) is derived from the fact that for fixed @xmath71 , @xmath72 moves uniformly on the surface of the @xmath19-dimensional hypersphere of radius @xmath73 when @xmath30 varies according to the uniform distribution of the orthogonal matrices ; therefore , @xmath74 in ( [ formula_def ] ) can be replaced with a spherical measure of @xmath19-dimensional vector @xmath75 . for details ,",
    "see [ appendix1 ] .",
    "function @xmath76 physically represents a characteristic exponent of the probability that @xmath19-dimensional vectors @xmath71 @xmath31 form a closed loop satisfying @xmath77 when they are independently and isotropically sampled under the norm constraints of @xmath78 . for small @xmath22 , the loop condition strongly restricts the region of @xmath79 to which @xmath76 is well defined . in concrete terms",

    "in particular , the constraint of ( [ t2 ] ) requires us to deal with the system of @xmath82 in a manner different from that of @xmath84 except for the case of @xmath85 , as discussed in the analysis of section 3.4 .",
    "now , we are ready to apply the replica method for analyzing the typical property of the @xmath6-recovery ( [ posterior_mean ] ) . for this , we evaluate the @xmath86-th moment of the partition function using the identity @xmath87 which is valid for only @xmath88 . in the large system limit",

    "our analysis indicated that the threshold is identical to that of the standard setup for which matrix entries are sampled independently from identical gaussian distribution when the non - zero entries in @xmath27 are distributed uniformly among @xmath22 blocks of the concatenation .",
