    "phase transition and critical phenomena are now considered from the physics point of view to be a fairly settled issue , thanks to numerous important works of these last 70 years . on the mathematical side , there now exists a couple of important discrete two - dimensional models for which one can really prove that the discrete critical system converges to a continuous scaling limit ( that turns out to be conformally invariant ) , but many fundamental problems remain unsolved .",
    "this includes the existence and the description of scaling limits for three - dimensional models , and the understanding of the universality question ( for instance : how can one prove that for a given model ",
    "say the percolation model  in a given dimension , all its critical versions behave in the same way in the scaling limit , independently of the chosen lattice ? ) .    in @xcite",
    ", a fairly simple renormalization formalism is described that enables to view the conjectured scaling limits of perturbations of the critical fk - percolation models ( recall that these form a family of models very closely related to ising and potts models ) as stationary distributions of a simple markov process on a state of discrete random weighted graphs ( see @xcite for more details , motivation and references ) . in the present paper , we explain how to implement this set - up for one of the mathematically best understood models , namely the uniform spanning tree ( ust ) .",
    "recall that one can interpret this model as being part of the class of critical fk - percolation models ( in the limit when the parameter @xmath1 governing the fk model goes to @xmath2 ) and that existence of the scaling limit , its description ( via sle curves ) and universality ( i.e. usts on different lattices have the same scaling limit ) have been proved in two dimensions @xcite , and that some partial results are even available in three dimensions @xcite .    in some sense ,",
    "our approach in the present paper is the analogous study - in the case of the ust - of some features of critical percolation that had been derived by garban , pete and schramm @xcite , who described the scaling limit of what one sees when one dynamically goes through the phase transition of planar percolation ( when opening at random and independently the edges or sites one after the other ) .",
    "our perturbation of the ust corresponds to a simple two - step procedure : first sample a ust and then erase some of its edges uniformly at random ( in a poissonian way ) .",
    "one then obtains a random forest because some edges of the tree are missing .",
    "uniformly cut uniform spanning tree_.    alternatively , we can view the erasing procedure in the reverse way , and let the different edges of the ust appear one after the other in random order ( and possibly stop a little bit before all edges have appeared ) .",
    "if we now observe these edges appearing one by one ( using the previously described rule ) without knowing a priori what the ust is going to be , one discovers only progressively which edges are eventually going to be in the ust .",
    "the first important and simple observation is that this dynamics is in fact a simple markov process on a set of subgraphs ( i.e. on the set of forests ) of the original graph , with jumps of this markov process corresponding to the opening of an edge ( i.e. to the merging of two trees into a single larger tree ) .",
    "let us spend a few lines to explain in more detail this simple discrete dynamical markovian construction of the ust in a finite connected graph @xmath3 with @xmath4 vertices . at step one , sample a ust in @xmath3 , and choose uniformly at random one of the @xmath5 edges of this ust , that we call @xmath6 .",
    "now , at time @xmath7 , we define @xmath8 to be the graph with vertices those of @xmath3 , but with just one open edge , @xmath6 .",
    "next , we want to choose a second edge .",
    "the conditional law of the ust given that @xmath6 has been chosen in the first step is just the distribution of the ust conditionally on the event that it contains @xmath6 ( this is just because for each tree that contains @xmath6 , the probability to choose @xmath6 in this first step is the constant @xmath9 ) .",
    "hence , in order to choose the second edge @xmath10 , we can sample a ust in the new graph obtained when merging the extremities of @xmath6 and then choose an edge uniformly at random in this tree .",
    "after @xmath5 such steps , one has in this way constructed a ust @xmath11 on @xmath3 with edges @xmath12 .",
    "it is then immediate to check that this construction of the ust is the time - reversal of the procedure where we first sample the ust @xmath11 , and then erase its edges one after the other uniformly at random .",
    "this discrete - time procedure has a simple continuous - time counterpart .",
    "since the number of edges in a spanning tree is anyway a graph - dependent constant , one can choose the rate at which an edge @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 opens at a given time @xmath16 to be the probability that @xmath13 will eventually belong to an ust in the graph @xmath17 obtained from @xmath3 by contracting all its edges that have been already open before time @xmath16 .",
    "note that this rate is just the effective resitence of the edge @xmath13 in the graph @xmath17 ( ie .",
    "it is the current that flows through @xmath13 when a total of one unit of current is sent from the tail of @xmath13 to the tip of @xmath13 , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to generalize this continuous - time markov process construction of the ust to infinite graphs , for instance to @xmath18 .",
    "then , when time is getting very large , while locally ( say near the origin ) the structure of the graph converges to that of the ust ( or the uniform spanning forest ( usf ) if @xmath19 ) , on a very large scale @xmath20 , there are still a lot of edges of the final tree ( or forest ) that have not yet been opened , so that the clusters that one sees are all of size much smaller than @xmath20 . and",
    "if one chooses an appropriate scale @xmath21 ( a procedure referred to as finite - size scaling ) , then the picture looks a little bit like the scaling limit of the ust that has been cut into multiple pieces in a poissonian way .",
    "hence , modulo appropriate rescaling , the picture when @xmath22 looks like a `` near - critical forest '' .",
    "in order to study the behavior of this markov process in its scaling limit , we will be to introduce a slightly different setting .",
    "each forest @xmath23 in our original graph @xmath3 is naturally associated to a more abstract graph @xmath24 with edge - weights , the structure graph of @xmath23 :    * clusters @xmath25 of @xmath23 corresponds in a one - to - one way to sites @xmath26 of @xmath24 .",
    "* when two clusters @xmath25 and @xmath27 are not adjacent , there is no edge joining @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "* when two clusters @xmath25 and @xmath27 are adjacent , then @xmath29 and @xmath30 are joined in @xmath24 by an edge @xmath31 with weight @xmath32 given by the number of edges ( of the original graph @xmath3 ) that connect @xmath25 to @xmath27 .",
    "the previously described markovian dynamics @xmath33 on the state of forests induces a markovian dynamics @xmath34 on this state of weighted graphs ( because the only information about @xmath35 that is used to describe the future evolution of the forest can be encapsulated in @xmath36 ) .",
    "the time - evolution for @xmath37 then corresponds to the merging of neighboring sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( i.e. collapsing of the edge @xmath31 between them ) that occurs at a certain rate depending on all the weights @xmath40 ( i.e. it depends on the entire graph @xmath37 ) .",
    "when one collapses @xmath39 and @xmath38 into a site @xmath41 , then the new edge - weights @xmath42 are simply given by @xmath43 , while the edge - weights corresponding to edges that are not adjacent to @xmath41 are left untouched .",
    "note that if @xmath44 has finitely many sites , then for any large enough time , @xmath36 is just a graph with one single point and no edge ( as it corresponds to the image of a tree under @xmath45 ) .",
    "we are now finally ready to describe in loose words the content of the main results ( theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] ) of the present paper :    1 .",
    "we will first see that the definition of our markov process on discrete structure graphs can be extended to a space of graphs with unbounded degrees , that one can view as the space of scaling limits of discrete structure graphs .",
    "the core of the paper is then to prove that the scaling limit of the markov process ( on discrete graphs ) is indeed this markovian continuous process ( it is not clear whether the scaling limit of a markov process is markov ) .",
    "this will already build on the description of the scaling limit of ust via sle , and on the predicted convergence of the renormalized length of these branches to their continuous counterparts .",
    "2 .   then , we will observe that in the case where one focuses on the ust in the whole plane , one gets a probability measure on this space of configurations that will be invariant under a rescaling of this markov process .",
    "this stationary measure can be interpreted as the scaling limit of near - critical planar ust ( it describes random forests ) .",
    "hence in the present case , one has described a setting in which renormalization makes complete rigorous sense : when one starts from a two - dimensional lattice and runs the markov process , the graph converges locally ( in distribution ) to the ust , and when one looks at the graph from further and further away , it converges to the fixed point of this markov process , that describes the near - critical scaling limit ( rather than the scaling limit itself ) .",
    "here is a list of some of the main technical features and tools that we shall use :    * we will use the framework introduced by schramm @xcite in order to describe the set in which our discrete objects ( the ust , the near - critical forests ) and their scaling limits live in : one encodes the limit of these near - critical forests to be the ( countable ) family of its `` continuous backbone branches '' ( corresponding to the limit of the macroscopic branches of the cut ust ) . * on this set of continuous forests , we will then define the dynamics . while the discrete dynamics are clearly markovian ,",
    "it is not obvious at all that the continuous process is ( as some information may have disappeared in the scaling limit ) .",
    "this is the same key - problem as in the case of near - critical percolation studied in @xcite .",
    "in order to prove this , we need a careful analysis of the discrete to continuous limiting procedure , and we shall use some stochastic comparisons between the evolutions of various graphs under our dynamics . * we rely on the convergence of the branches of the ust ( i.e. loop - erased random walks converge to sle@xmath0 , as proved in lawler , schramm , werner @xcite ) but one also needs to control the clocks of our dynamics i.e. the number of edges on these branches , as they control the time - evolution . for this",
    ", we will in fact use the convergence of the loop - erased random walk towards the sle@xmath0 in this `` natural parametrization '' for the uniform topology ( this result will be recalled in the next section ) , due to johansson - viklund and lawler @xcite ( and builds on earlier work of these authors with benes @xcite ) .",
    "the paper will be structured as follows :    * in section [ sec : ustandustlimits ] , we first recall some features of ust s , briefly define schramm s framework for scaling limits , and investigate the scaling limit of the cutting of ust s in bounded domains . * in section [ sec : forw ] , we study the time - reversal of the cutting dynamics seen on `` structure graphs '' , and state our first main result , i.e. that this time - reversal is markovian .",
    "we then explain why the whole - plane version of these results can be interpreted in terms of a renormalization flow fixed point . * in section [ lastsection ]",
    ", we prove the technical lemmas on discrete ust events , that are needed in the previous proofs .",
    "* in the appendix , we use the results of @xcite in order to derive the actual facts about convergence of length to natural parametrization in the settings that we need .",
    "let us conclude this introduction with a few words about `` near - critical '' models , in order to stress the fact that the near - critical forests that we construct and describe here are not exactly part of the fk - percolation family ( this feature also appears in the general setup described in @xcite ) .",
    "recall that the word critical ( in critical models ) here usually refers to the fact that one considers a one - parameter family of lattice models , and that there is a phase - transition for this `` critical '' value of the parameter .",
    "however , there are often more than one parameter that one can play with in order to perturb the discrete model , and therefore several possible near - critical models .    on a finite - graph",
    ", it is well known that the law @xmath46 of the uniform spanning tree can be viewed as the limit when @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the random cluster ( or fk)-measure @xmath49 ( indeed , the fact that @xmath50 faster than @xmath51 ensures that most of the mass of @xmath49 sits on the configurations with just one connected component , and the fact that @xmath52 ensures that the system uses the minimal amount of edges ) .    when @xmath50 and @xmath53 remains fixed , the measure becomes simply @xmath54 which is critical percolation conditioned to have exactly one connected component . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath50 and @xmath51 is of the same order as @xmath1 , then the limit will be supported on forests ( i.e. collections of trees ) .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath55 , the @xmath50 limit is the uniform measure on forests and when @xmath56 , the limit measure is the percolation measure of parameter @xmath57 conditioned on the non - existence of open circuits .",
    "this leads ( via finite - site scaling , tuning @xmath58 appropriately , and letting @xmath50 and @xmath59 ) to a continuous model , that corresponds to a near - critical continuous uniform spanning forest , and is a perturbation of the continuous ust .",
    "however , the object obtained via such a construction will differ from the one that we study in the present paper ( and that is obtained from first sampling the ust and then cutting some edges uniformly at random ) .",
    "indeed , the discrete measures @xmath60 assign the same probability to different forests that have the same number of trees , whereas in our cutting perturbation of the ust , the weight of a configuration depends in a non - trivial way on the lengths of the boundaries between the trees in the forest ( as they indicate how many possible ways there were to construct the forest by cutting a tree at random ) .",
    "let us very quickly browse through some of the standard ust features and definitions that we will use .",
    "the uniform spanning tree ( ust ) @xmath61 on a finite connected graph @xmath3 is a random subgraph of @xmath3 that has been uniformly chosen among those connected subgraphs that contain all vertices of @xmath3 , and are cycle - free .",
    "if @xmath3 is an infinite graph , one can define a similar object @xmath61 , the free uniform spanning forest or usf ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as the weak limit of usts on @xmath62 , where @xmath62 is any increasing exhaustion of @xmath3 by finite connected subgraphs . depending on the infinite graph , this uniform spanning forest can be almost surely a tree , or not . in @xmath18 for @xmath63 ,",
    "the free spanning forest is actually a.s .",
    "a tree ( and called a ust as well ) .",
    "the notion of ust can be extended to weighted graphs : let @xmath64 be a finite graph and @xmath65 denotes its weights . then the weighted spanning tree is the probability measure on the set of all spanning trees such that the probability to choose a tree @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath67 . if @xmath3 is an infinite weighted graph , one can define the _ weighted free spanning forest _ , a probability measure on the subgraphs of @xmath3 , as the weak limit of the weighted spanning tree on @xmath62 ( where @xmath62 is any connected exhaustion of the weighted graph @xmath3 ) .",
    "this definition in fact works even if the graph is not locally finite ( i.e. sites are allowed to have infinitely many neighbors , and the sum of the incoming weights is even allowed to be infinite ) .",
    "similarly , depending on @xmath3 , this weighted free spanning forest can almost surely be a tree or not .",
    "suppose now that @xmath66 is a spanning tree of the graph @xmath3 and that @xmath68 is a finite set of vertices @xmath3 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath69 the minimal connected subgraph of @xmath66 containing @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a forest ( a disjoint union of trees ) of @xmath3 , then we define @xmath70 as the reunion of the subtrees generated by @xmath68 on all the connected components of @xmath23 .",
    "wilson @xcite provided an algorithm to sample from the ust measure on a finite graph @xmath3 , by iteratively generating branches as loop - erased random walks on the graph @xmath3 : enumerate the vertices of your graph @xmath3 : @xmath71 . at the n - th step of the algorithm",
    "we have constructed a tree @xmath72 that will eventually turn out to be @xmath73 .",
    "start with a single point @xmath74 . to build @xmath75 , run",
    "a simple random walk @xmath76 on @xmath3 started from @xmath77 and stopped upon hitting @xmath78 .",
    "consider the ( chronological ) loop - erasure @xmath79 of @xmath76 , and let @xmath80 .",
    "then , the final tree @xmath81 has the law of a ust on @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that wilson s algorithm can be extended to ( locally finite ) infinite graphs such as @xmath18 , as well as to weighted graphs ( one just needs to replace the simple random walk by a random walk with non - constant conductances ) .",
    "this generates a random infinite forest , known as the wired spanning forest . in @xmath18 or in graphs that are obtained from @xmath18 by contracting or erasing some edges , the free usf and the wired usf coincide ,",
    "see @xcite .    at some points in the paper",
    ", we will use coupling results between usts in various domains ( this type of result is in fact instrumental in deriving the existence and properties of some of the objects mentioned above , such as the free usf ) .",
    "let us first recall ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.3-(a ) ) ) that if one considers two connected graphs @xmath3 and @xmath82 with the same vertex sets , but where the set of edges of @xmath3 contains the set @xmath83 of edges of @xmath82 , then it is possible to couple the ust in @xmath3 with the ust in @xmath82 in such a way that @xmath84 almost surely .",
    "suppose now that @xmath85 is a collection of edges of a finite graph @xmath3 , and let @xmath86 be two subsets of @xmath85 that can be both completed into spanning trees of @xmath3 by adding edges that are not in @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath87 ( resp .",
    "@xmath88 ) , be the uniform spanning tree @xmath61 on @xmath3 , conditioned on @xmath89 ( resp . on @xmath90 ) .",
    "it is then possible to couple @xmath87 and @xmath88 in such a way that @xmath91 almost surely .",
    "indeed , one can first condition both usts to contain all edges in @xmath92 and no edge in @xmath93 ( and this corresponds to just removing the edges of @xmath93 from the graph and to collapse all edges of @xmath92 ) .",
    "hence , one needs only to treat the case where @xmath92 is empty and @xmath94 , which can be deduced from the previously mentioned result by conditioning on @xmath95 .",
    "again , these results have fairly obvious generalizations to the case of weighted graphs ( we safely leave their proofs to the readers ) .      in order to describe the scaling limits of our forests",
    ", we will use the framework introduced by oded schramm @xcite ; let us briefly review its basic features ( we refer to section 10 of @xcite for details ) .    for a compact topological space @xmath96 ,",
    "let us call @xmath97 the set of compact subsets of @xmath96 equipped with the hausdorff topology ; recall that @xmath98 is itself a compact space .",
    "we call _ schramm space _",
    "@xmath99 in the riemann sphere @xmath100 the set @xmath101 equipped with its hausdorff topology .",
    "similarly , when @xmath102 is a simply - connected bounded domain of the plane with @xmath103 boundary , we define @xmath104 .",
    "the distance of this hausdorff topology on @xmath99 or @xmath105 is denoted by @xmath106 .",
    "note that as we took @xmath107 to be bounded , it does not matter whether one works initially with the spherical or euclidean distance in @xmath107 .",
    "all these spaces are compact , so that any sequence of probability measures on those spaces possesses subsequential limits .    in the framework of uniform spanning trees and their scaling limits",
    ", one considers very special elements in @xmath99 ( in particular elements @xmath108 in @xmath99 with the property that if @xmath109 , then @xmath110 is a continuous path from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , and @xmath113 ) .",
    "a discrete graph embedded in the plane can be encoded by its path ensemble , i.e. by a point @xmath108 in the schramm space such that @xmath114 where @xmath115 run over all couple of points in the graph and @xmath116 runs over all simple ( continuous ) paths joining @xmath111 to @xmath112 in the graph . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath111 or @xmath112 does not belong to the graph or if @xmath111 and @xmath112 are in different connected components , then there is no triplet of the form @xmath117 in the corresponding path ensemble .",
    "the ust on a discrete graph embedded in the plane can then be viewed as a probability measure on @xmath99 , and by compactness , it has subsequential limits when one lets the mesh of the lattice go to zero .",
    "as we shall now recall , this subsequential limit is in fact a limit : from now on and until further notice , @xmath102 will denote either the entire plane or a simply - connected bounded domain of the plane with @xmath103 boundary .",
    "we set @xmath118 a simply connected discretization of it at mesh size @xmath119 of the same type as in @xcite ( `` union of squares '' domain , paragraph 2.1 ) : fix @xmath120 and consider @xmath121 the simply connected subset of @xmath122 containing @xmath123 .",

    "the branches of uniform spanning trees are loop - erased random walks ( lerw ) , which have been shown by lawler , schramm and werner to converge to sle@xmath0 paths in the scaling limit ( this convergence holds for paths parametrized by `` loewner capacity '' which yields in particular convergence for paths up to monotone reparametrization ) , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we know that the law of the continuous ust in the whole plane is scale - invariant .",
    "it therefore immediately follows that the processes @xmath337 and @xmath338 are scale - invariant too , in the following sense : for each @xmath339 , we define @xmath340 to be the set obtained by magnifying all clusters by a factor @xmath341 , and @xmath342 the graph obtained by also magnifying all edge - weights by a factor @xmath343 ( in other words , one relabels the edges of @xmath260 by just multiplying them by a factor @xmath343 .",
    "then , the process @xmath344 is identical in distribution to the process @xmath345 .",
    "let us now define @xmath346 to be the distribution of @xmath347 .",
    "theorem [ main1 ] then states exactly that the process @xmath348 is obtained by letting the ( time - homogeneous ) markov dynamics run from @xmath347 .",
    "but by the scale - invariance property , we get that ( modulo relabeling of the edges of the structure graph ) , the distribution @xmath346 is invariant under the time - homogeneous markovian dynamic .",
    "finally , we can also note that if we start from the graph @xmath349 with all edge - weights equal to @xmath7 ( or any other regular planar lattice ) and let the time - homogeneous markov chain @xmath350 run until a large time @xmath351 , we discover each edge of the final ust on @xmath175 ( independently ) with probability @xmath352 ( or more exactly , rather than their edges , their `` traces on the structure graphs '' ) .",
    "in particular , with theorem [ main1 ] , this shows that ( modulo relabeling of the edges of the structure graph i.e. scaling down @xmath175 to @xmath192 for an appropriately chosen @xmath191 depending on @xmath351 ) , that as @xmath353 , the law of the structure graph converges to @xmath346 ( in the sense of corollary [ thmm : cv - struct - graph ] ) .",

    "furthermore , the ( time - homogeneous ) markov chain started from any deterministic periodic two - dimensional transitive lattice and properly rescaled does converge in distribution to @xmath346 .",
    "most of the remainder of this paper is now devoted to the proof of proposition [ lem : weightst ] , that provides the convergence of the discrete structure graph weights to their continuous counterpart . in this section",
    ", we are working with the ust on the whole plane but the proofs can easily be extended to any bounded domain with @xmath198 boundary .",
    "let us now make some comments about this , and explain how to deduce proposition [ lem : weightst ] from two lemmas that we will then prove in the subsequent section , based on more `` traditional '' arm - estimates and considerations for ust .",
    "suppose first that @xmath262 and @xmath263 are two given points . in both the discrete and continuous settings ,",
    "these two points are joined by a unique path in the ust , that has a finite ( renormalized ) length ( or minkowski content  by slight abuse of terminology , we will now use the word length also in the continuous case ) , so that the number of `` cuts '' on this branch ( conditional on this length , and for a given @xmath16 ) follows a poisson distribution .",
    "if these two points @xmath262 and @xmath263 end up in different trees at the end of the cutting procedure , then there as been a `` first cut '' i.e. an edge @xmath13 on this path that has been removed first ( when one looks back from time @xmath2 to time @xmath16 in the cutting procedure ) , and its law ( conditional on the branch between @xmath262 and @xmath263 ) is uniform on this branch with respect to length .",
    "mind that the edge @xmath13 has a positive probability not to exist ( if there were no cut on the branch ) .",
    "if we consider the entire ust and removes from it just this one edge @xmath13 , then one has divided the ust into two trees , one containing @xmath262 and the other one containing @xmath263 .",
    "the interface between these two trees is then described by a cycle @xmath355 that consists of the edge @xmath356 dual to @xmath13 together with the branch in the dual of the ust , that joins ( in the dual tree ) the two extremities of @xmath356 .",
    "clearly , if one removes more edges than just @xmath13 , the trees that contain @xmath262 and @xmath263 respectively will shrink ( it may become empty ) , and the interface between these two trees can only decrease . hence , the interface between the two clusters of @xmath248 that contain @xmath262 and @xmath263 is a subset of this cycle ( and its length is bounded by that of @xmath355 ) .",
    "the same situation occurs in the continuous case . here ,",
    "when one chooses a first point @xmath357 at random ( according to minkowski - content ) on the ust branch joining @xmath262 and @xmath263 , one can consider the cycle @xmath358 in the dual tree that joins @xmath357 to itself , and when one removes more points according to the cutting dynamics , the clusters that contain the two points @xmath262 and @xmath263 will intersect along a subset of that cycle @xmath358 .     and the cuts , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and the cuts , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    note that we have a first easy lemma , that follows from the convergence in distribution of @xmath355 and from the convergence of the renormalized measure on the branch from @xmath262 to @xmath263 . in the following",

    "next , one can make the following observations ( that can be made rigorous , but they serve here as a motivation and wo nt be used later , so we will not bother to do so ) : suppose that in the previous scenario , one considers the continuous tree containing @xmath263 after cutting away just @xmath13 , and that this tree is bounded ( if we were in the whole plane , this means that @xmath263 was on the bounded side of the cut @xmath13 ) .",

    "one can notice that for a `` typical point '' on the cycle @xmath371 , the ( minkowski - content ) length between this point @xmath357 and @xmath263 in the initial tree is finite .",
    "hence , it will have a positive probability to be cut off from @xmath263 , but it also has a positive probability not to be cut off .",
    "hence , the expected portion of the length of the part of @xmath371 that will remain on the outer boundary of the cluster containing @xmath263 is in fact positive . on the other hand , a back - of - the envelope calculation ( that we do not reproduce here ) suggests that the total length of the tree consisting of all the branches that join @xmath263 to all the boundary points in @xmath371 is infinite .",
    "this means that an infinite number of macroscopic pieces of @xmath371 are being cut out .",
