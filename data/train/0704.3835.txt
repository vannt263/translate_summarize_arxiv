    "the spin glass theory of infinite - ranged models  @xcite has inspired a generation of physicists to study many theoretically challenging and practically important problems in physics and information processing  @xcite .",
    "these problems share a common feature , in that the disordered interactions among their elements cause frustration and non - ergodic behaviour .",
    "the replica method  @xcite has been useful in explaining their macroscopic behaviour . at the same time , based on the microscopic descriptions of the models , the cavity method  @xcite resulted in many computationally efficient schemes .",
    "these approaches have laid the foundation for the study of many problems in complex optimisation using statistical mechanics , such as graph partitioning  @xcite , travelling salesman  @xcite , @xmath0-satisfiability  @xcite , and graph colouring  @xcite .",
    "not only the graph colouring problem  @xcite is among the most basic np - complete problems  @xcite , but it also has direct relevance to a variety of applications in scheduling , distributed storage , content distribution and distributed computing .    in the original problem , one",
    "is given a graph and a number of colours , and the task is to find a colouring solution such that any two connected vertices are assigned different colours .",
    "this is equivalent to the potts glass with nearest neighbouring interactions in statistical physics .",
    "the problem has been studied by physicists using the cavity method  @xcite . for a given number of colours",
    ", a phase transition takes place when the connectivity increases , changing from a colourable to an uncolourable phase .",
    "one of the statistical physics approaches was based on the replica symmetric ( rs ) ansatz .",
    "it gave an over - estimate of the threshold connectivity of this phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the one - step replica symmetry - breaking ( 1rsb ) approach takes into account the possibility that the solution space can be fragmented  @xcite . besides giving an estimate of the threshold connectivity within the mathematical bounds",
    ", it correctly predicts the existence of a clustering phase below the threshold , in which the solution space spontaneously divides into an exponential number of clusters .",
    "this is called the hard colourable phase , in which local search algorithms are rendered ineffective , and is a feature shared by other constraint satisfaction problems  @xcite .",
    "the sequence of phase transitions in the graph colouring problem , and their algorithmic implications , were further refined recently  @xcite .",
    "these advances in the spin glass theory stimulated the development of efficient algorithms .",
    "the cavity method gave rise to equations identical to those of belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm for graphical models  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the 1rsb solution , survey propagation ( sp ) algorithms were subsequently developed to cope with situations with fragmented solution space  @xcite , and they work well even in the hard phase of the graph colouring problem  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study a variant of the graph colouring problem , namely , the colour diversity problem . in this problem",
    ", the aim is to maximise the number of colours within one link distance of any node .",
    "this is equivalent to the potts glass with second nearest neighbouring interactions in statistical physics , and hence is more complex than the original graph colouring problem in terms of the increased number of frustrated links .",
    "indeed , this variant of the colouring problem has been shown to be np - complete  @xcite .",
    "this optimisation problem is directly related to various application areas and in particular to the problem of distributed data storage where files are divided to a number of segments , which are then distributed over a graph representing the network .",
    "nodes requesting a particular file collect the required number of file segments from neighbouring nodes to retrieve the original information .",
    "distributed storage is used in many real world applications such as oceanstore  @xcite .",
    "compared with the original graph colouring problem , work done on the colour diversity problem mainly focused on algorithms  @xcite .",
    "belief propagation ( bp ) and walksat algorithms for solving the problem have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "both algorithms revealed a transition from incomplete to complete colouring , and the possibility of a region of hard colouring immediately below the transition point .",
    "approximate connectivity regimes for the solvable case have been found , given the number of colours  @xcite .",
    "however , since the algorithms are based on simplifying approximations ( bp ) and heuristics ( walksat ) , both algorithms provide only upper bounds to the true critical values .",
    "the current study aims at providing a more principled approach to study the problem , a theoretical estimate of the transition point , and more insights on the nature of the transition itself .",
    "the method employed is based on a tree approximation , which is equivalent to the rs ansatz of the replica method or the cavity method .",
    "it results in a set of recursive equations which can be solved analytically .",
    "the connectivity values for which the tree approximation is valid and the types of phases present at each value are also investigated at both zero and finite temperatures .    in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model , followed by section  [ sec : macro ] that explains briefly the derivation and how the macroscopic behaviour can be studied . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results obtained via population dynamics .",
    "discussions on the behaviour at finite temperatures are presented in section  [ sec : finitetemp ] followed by a concluding section .",

    "consider a sparsely connected graph with connectivity @xmath1 and colour @xmath2 for node @xmath3 .",
    "the connectivities @xmath1 are drawn from a distribution @xmath4 with mean @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we consider the case of _ linear connectivity _ , that is , the nodes have connectivities @xmath6 or @xmath7 , with probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",

    "the colour diversity problem is trivial for the case @xmath11 , in which colour schemes with complete sets of colours available to all nodes can be found easily .",
    "hence we will focus on the more interesting case @xmath12 , in which a transition between complete and incomplete colouring exists , as shown in previous work  @xcite .",
    "the set of colours available at the node and its local neighbourhood is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the set of nearest neighbours of node @xmath3 . to find a colour scheme that maximises the number of different colours in @xmath15 and averaged over all nodes @xmath3",

    "@xmath17 can be rewritten as @xmath21 } ^2.\\ ] ]    the quadratic nature of @xmath17 confirms that it is an appropriate cost function for diversifying the colours in the neighbourhood of each node . due to the convexity of its quadratic form , its minimum solution tends to equalise the numbers of all colours in the neighbourhood of a node .",
    "thus , besides maximising colour diversity , our choice of the cost function has an additional advantage for the distributed storage optimisation task , which has motivated the current study , where an even distribution of segments ( colours ) in a neighbourhood is also a secondary objective , offering greater resilience .",
    "the need for an even distribution of colours is especially important when the total number of colours is less than the connectivity of a node .",
    "consider the contribution from the function @xmath17 centred on a node in such a case .",
    "some colours can appear more than once .",
    "then the exact form of the function @xmath17 determines the selection of these extra colours . in general ,",
    "two types of selection can be made . in the first type",
    ", one may still use all colours , but they may be less evenly distributed than in the ground state . in the second type , one may use fewer colours .",
    "the former maximises the number of available colours , but the latter does not . in this case",
    ", an inappropriate choice of the cost function will mix these two cases assigning the same energies , rendering it impossible to distinguish optimal and suboptimal colour choices .    on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) does not suffer from this shortcoming in the topology considered here .",
    "a geometric interpretation is able to illustrate this point .",
    "let @xmath22 be the number of times colour @xmath23 appears in @xmath15 .",
    "then the minimisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) reduces to the minimisation of @xmath24 subject to the constraint that @xmath25 .",
    "note that the constraint defines a hyperplane in the @xmath26-dimensional space of @xmath22 , and the problem is equivalent to finding the point with integer coordinates on the hyperplane such that its distance from the origin is minimised .",

    "in fact , the optimal solution is @xmath28 $ ] for @xmath29 , and @xmath28 + 1 $ ] otherwise ( or its permutations ) .",
    "we have also considered a worst case analysis of the change in the total cost due to colour changes in neighbouring nodes when the function @xmath17 , centred on a node @xmath3 , is minimised .",
    "it shows that for networks with linear connectivities and @xmath12 , the ground states consist of all satisfied nodes only , if they exist .",
    "we note that second nearest neighbour interactions are present in this cost function .",
    "this is different from that of the original graph colouring problem , where the cost function involves only nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "as we shall see , the messages in the resultant message - passing algorithm will be characterised by two components , instead of the single components in the case of the original graph colouring problem  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the problem is done by writing the free energy of the system at a temperature @xmath30 , given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the partition function given by @xmath33,\\ ] ] @xmath34 being the inverse temperature . in the zero temperature limit , the free energy approaches the minimum cost function .",
    "several methods exist for deriving the free energy based on the replica and tree - based approximations . here",
    ", the analysis adopts a tree - based approximation , which is valid for sparse graphs .",
    "when the connectivity of the graph is low , the probability of finding a loop of finite length on the graph is low , and the tree approximation well describes the local environment of a node . in the approximation , node @xmath3 is connected to @xmath1 branches in a tree structure , and the correlations among the branches of the tree are neglected . in each branch , nodes are arranged in generations .",
    "node @xmath3 is connected to an ancestor node of the previous generation , and another @xmath35 descendent nodes of the next generation .",

    "one notes that this free energy can be written as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of nodes in the tree terminated at node @xmath37 , and @xmath42 is referred to as the _ vertex free energy _  @xcite .",

    "however , since the probability of finding a descendant node connecting to it is proportional to the number of links the descendant has , descendants are drawn with the _ excess probability _ @xmath52 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : vertexfreerecursion_al ] ) and ( [ eq : fav ] ) can also be derived using the replica method as presented in appendix a. we remark that both the derivation and the results are very similar to those in the problem of resource allocation on sparse networks  @xcite , where the dynamical variables are the real - valued currents on the links of the networks .",
    "the parallelism between resource allocation and colour diversity is apparent when one notes that the currents in resource allocation can be expressed as the differences between current potentials defined on the nodes of the networks .",
    "hence the vertex free energies in both problems can be considered as functions of two variables .",
