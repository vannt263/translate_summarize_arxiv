    "the mean - square displacement ( msd ) of an atom is a fundamental dynamical quantity . in proteins",
    "the temperature dependence of the average msd has been widely used to characterize the internal flexibility of the protein.@xcite the msd can be extracted from dynamic neutron scattering experiments . since the incoherent neutron scattering cross section of the hydrogen ( h ) nucleus is large , the observed msd is dominated by the msd of h in the protein . as a result",
    ", the msd of hydrogen in proteins has been extensively investigated by neutron scattering@xcite and the results compared with molecular dynamics simulation , a technique particularly complementary to dynamic neutron scattering.@xcite these studies have been performed as a function of temperature , pressure , hydration and in a variety of solvents.@xcite    most neutron and md studies to date have investigated the msd on a picosecond - nanosecond ( ps - ns ) timescale.@xcite at low temperatures ( @xmath4 k ) , a protein is essentially harmonic . as the temperature is increased beyond the harmonic regime , proline puckering transitions and methyl rotations are activated.@xcite these onsets are independent of protein hydration . at temperatures @xmath5 160 - 220 k",
    ", jumps of non - exchangeable hydrogen in the non - proline methylene groups and aromatic phenyl rings dominate the msd on the @xmath6 second time scale . for @xmath7 220 k protein flexibility",
    "arises chiefly from the hydrophobic and aromatic residues .",
    "in contrast , motion of the hydrophilic residues remains suppressed due to stable hydrogen bonding interactions with the neighboring protein residues and hydration water . as @xmath8 is further increased , at @xmath9 k , a strongly hydration - dependent increase is found in the localized diffusion of protein non - exchangeable hydrogen atoms and in jumps in the hydrophilic side chains . the resulting increase in msd",
    "is denoted the dynamical transition ( dt ) .",
    "the jumps in hydrophilic side chains are strongly coupled to the relaxation rates of the hydrogen bonds formed with hydration water.@xcite    md has also been used to probe the pressure dependence of protein msds.@xcite these md studies revealed a qualitative change in the internal protein motions at @xmath10 kbar and the existence of two linear regimes in the msd . the qualitative change is a loss with increasing pressure of large amplitude , collective protein modes below 2 thz effective frequency , accompanied by restriction of large - scale solvent translational motion.@xcite the dt was found to be pressure - independent , indicating that the effective energy barriers separating conformational substates are not significantly influenced by pressure .",
    "in contrast , vibrations within substates stiffen with pressure , due to increased curvature of the local harmonic potential in which the atoms vibrate.@xcite    given the extensive interest in msds , both observed and simulated , it is useful to clarify in detail what is measured and calculated and the possible relation to equilibrium thermodynamics . a global incoherent dynamic structure factor , , dominated by hydrogen ,",
    "is observed in neutron scattering measurements .",
    "a first consideration is that the hydrogen atoms in a protein occupy a spectrum of sites and the fluctuation of h in these sites follows a wide distribution , which can be modelled using a weibull form.@xcite this heterogeneity in the distribution of mean - square displacements leads to dynamic structure factors , , that deviate from gaussian behaviour in the scattering wave vector @xmath11 .",
    "the heterogeneity introduces a correction to fourth order in @xmath11 that can be used to extract the variance of the distribution of mean - square displacements.@xcite    similarly , the global msd obtained from neutron scattering measurements depends on the energy resolution employed .",
    "the msd is obtained from the elastic (   = 0 ) component of the resolution broadened dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) , , as @xmath12 the   extracted in this way is the msd after it has had time to develop over a limited time , 0 @xmath13   only . the time   is set by the width of the energy resolution of the neutron instrument ,  @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the resolution function .",
    "typical instrument energy resolutions lie in the range 100 @xmath3ev @xmath16 1@xmath17ev which correspond to evolution times 10 ps @xmath18 @xmath18 1 ns . over this time range",
    "the extracted   is still increasing with decreasing @xmath15 ( increasing ) indicating that the intrinsic , long time ( @xmath19 ) value of   has not been observed.@xcite    in an earlier paper@xcite , we proposed a method to extract the intrinsic , long time msd   from resolution dependent data . in the method , the intrinsic",
    "was defined in terms of the t = @xmath20 limit of the incoherent intermediate scattering function ( isf ) , , as @xmath21 the method consists of constructing a model   that includes   and , calculating the corresponding   including the resolution width , @xmath15 , and fitting the model to the observed .",
    "the intrinsic   is obtained from the fit as a fitting parameter . in this way an intrinsic , long time",
    "was obtained from resolution dependent data .",
    "the incoherent intermediate scattering function , , that is observed in neutron measurements can also be calculated directly from simulations.@xcite a comparison between the simulation - derived and observed msd can be made by calculating the simulation - derived msd in exactly the same way as it is obtained from experiment.@xcite that is , from the simulated , the incoherent dsf   is calculated including the instrument resolution width , @xmath15 .",
    "the msd is obtained from the slope of the calculated resolution broadened , at small q using eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "this effectively compares the msd after it has evolved for a specific time @xmath22 set by @xmath15 . in this way",
    "excellent agreement between simulated and observed msd has been achieved .",
    "this also opens the question : could simulated intrinsic , long time   be obtained by fitting a model to finite time values of a calculated ?    to explicitly recognize the time dependence of , the concept of neutron time windows was introduced , a concept in which the effects arising from the finite energy resolution are fully integrated.@xcite the concept has also been incorporated into the formalism that describes the dynamics accompanying the glass transition in molecular systems .",
    "when the protein relaxation time decreases with temperature , as it usually does , it has been shown that measurement of   over a finite time window can introduce an apparent dt when there is no actual change in the elastic incoherent dsf , .@xcite to avoid this issue , identification and use of an intrinsic , long time msd   would be helpful .",
    "several md studies have been performed aimed at understanding the origin of elastic neutron scattering from proteins.@xcite these studies have characterized in detail the contributions of time dependence , of non - gaussian behavior and of dynamical heterogeneity to elastic scattering on the ps - ns timescales .",
    "the strong time - dependence of   revealed in these studies further opens the question as to whether an intrinsic long - time , time - independent msd can be obtained from simulations .",
    "given that folded proteins have well - defined three - dimensional structures , a well defined long time , intrinsic msd would seem to be reasonable and should exist .",
    "that is , the internal mean - square displacement arising from internal motions in proteins should converge to a plateau as a function of time and a parallel in proteins of the debye - waller and x - ray b factors found in the crystalline state should exist . given this assumption ,",
    "the question focuses on developing a method to extract the intrinsic   from finite time simulations .",
