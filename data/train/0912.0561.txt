    "so far , radial velocity exoplanet searches have mainly focused on solar - like main sequence stars .",
    "however , searches for exoplanets around m dwarfs have also been successful , and knowing the frequency of these objects places important constraints on planet formation scenarios .",
    "some of the least massive exoplanets known orbit low - mass m dwarfs ( e.g.  gj581 and gj876  rivera et  al . 2005 ; udry et  al .",
    "2007 ; mayor et  al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "m dwarfs are the most common stars in the solar neighborhood , and their habitable zones lie close to them .",
    "this means that `` habitable '' planets around m dwarfs have large radial - velocity signatures and a large probability of showing transits . in spite of their interest ,",
    "m dwarfs have not been searched for planets as extensively as late - f , g , and k stars , because of their faintness in the optical , where most radial velocity searches are being performed . a near - infrared spectrograph with a radial velocity accuracy on the ms@xmath0 level would be more efficient to detect earth - like planets around stars with spectral types later than about m3 .",
    "radial velocities measured in the near infrared would also be less susceptible to stellar radial - velocity noise . as a high - resolution near - infrared spectrograph dedicated to a planet survey",
    "does not exist yet , we have performed a study of such an instrument for the calar alto astronomical observatory .",
    "the carmenes study was initiated as a joint spanish - german answer to a call for ideas for new instruments for calar alto . in this contribution",
    ", we describe a summary of the carmenes configuration as it was presented in the conceptual design review in early october 2009 .",
    "( the configuration may have changed since then ; visit our webpage for later developments ) .",
    "carmenes is expected to become operational in 2013 .",
    "carmenes will be fiber - fed from a front - end at the prime focus of the 3.5 m calar alto telescope .",
    "the three cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph channels ( nir , vis , mos ; see below ) will be located in the coud room of the telescope , where they can be thermally and mechanically stabilized .",
    "the instrument will cover from 500 to 1800 nm in one shot with a near - ir radial velocity precision requirement of 3ms@xmath0 .",
    "thanks to an optical design with a mosaic of two 2k@xmath12k detectors and an r2.9 echelle grating , the near - infrared ( nir ) channel will cover from 950 nm ( @xmath2 band ) to about 1800 nm ( @xmath3 band ) with a spectral resolution r = 85000 in 31 echelle orders .",
    "the cross disperser will consist of two s - nph2 prisms .",
    "most of the optomechanical components of the nir channel will be located inside a vacuum tank at @xmath4 = 30@xmath5c .",
    "the nir channel needs an image slicer and an image scrambler",
    ".    the design of the visible ( vis ) channel , which will cover from 500 to 900 nm with r = 60000 in 42 echelle orders , will be based on the successful feros instrument .",
    "simultaneous observations with the nir and vis channels will allow us to monitor the main activity indicators ( h@xmath6 and the calcium triplet ) with the same temporal sampling as the radial - velocity curve , which will help us discriminate between activity - induced and planet - induced radial - velocity variations .",
    "the multiobject ( mos ) visible channel takes advantage of the @xmath70.8deg@xmath8 field of the 3.5 m telescope to acquire the spectra of @xmath712 bright stars during the m dwarf observations ; in this way a survey of g and k giants can be conducted without any additional telescope time .",
    "carmenes may share the telescope prime focus with another instrument .",
    "the design therefore foresees a common front end mounted at the primary focus behind the k3 corrector .",
    "this front end will contain the fiber positioners for the carmenes nir , vis and mos channels .",
    "our primary channels ( nir and vis ) require two fibers each : one for the object and one for a thar lamp or sky .",
    "the carmenes study was funded by the centro astronmico hispano - alemn , which is operated jointly by the max - planck - institut fr astronomie ( max - planck - gesellschaft ) and the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( consejo superior de investigaciones cientficas ) ."
