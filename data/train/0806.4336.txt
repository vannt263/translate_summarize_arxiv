    "the dynamics of a quantum coherent capacitor connected via a single contact to an electron reservoir have attracted experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "a capacitor connected via a quantum point contact ( qpc ) to an edge state shows mesoscopic capacitance oscillations and a quantized charge relaxation resistance  @xcite .",
    "in addition a recent experiment demonstrated an `` electron gun '' emitting and absorbing a single electron in every oscillation cycle  @xcite .",
    "the emission process  @xcite injects an electron into states above the fermi level , whereas absorption of an electron leaves a hole below the fermi energy .",
    "the invention of lasers revolutionized optics .",
    "similarly , single electron injectors either using capacitors or quantized electron pumps  @xcite provide novel , coherent sources for electronics .",
    "it is a challenging task to detect the electrons with the speed they were emitted with . in modern experiments the dynamics of single electron transport through a mesoscopic system is often explored experimentally using as a charge detector , either a radio - frequency single - electron transistor  @xcite or a qpc  @xcite .",
    "however the speed of these detectors is not sufficient to detect electrons with a nanosecond resolution . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we propose as a fast detector a device which is analogous to the emitter : a quantum capacitor , such as used in  @xcite .",
    "such a detector is able to register particles as fast as an emitter can inject them into the quantum circuit .",
    "we therefore consider a system consisting of two quantum cavities coupled in series by a single edge state and modulated by in general different , periodically - varying potentials , both with frequency @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",

    "namely , the potential @xmath1 can be chosen in such a way that the total current vanishes .",
    "in general the current @xmath2 consists of a series of pulses corresponding to electrons and holes emitted by either of the cavities .",
    "however if the time when an electron was emitted by the first cavity coincides with the time when a hole was emitted by the second cavity the total current @xmath2 is suppressed .",
    "this electron - hole annihilation process can be viewed as the reabsorption by the second cavity of an electron emitted by the first cavity and it can be used to count electrons",
    ". if the counting efficiency is perfect the total current vanishes completely  @xcite .",
    "since the capacitor system generates an ac current it is convenient to investigate the degree of the current suppression by studying the square of the current integrated over one period @xmath3 , @xmath4 note that @xmath5 is different from the noise , see ref . .",
    "we develop the conditions for nullifying the total current and investigate the measuring precision . alternatively ,",
