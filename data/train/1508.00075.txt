    "systems with two - body zero - range interactions constitute important models in physics .",
    "although realistic two - body interactions do typically have a finite range , results for systems with zero - range interactions provide a starting point for understanding complicated few- and many - body dynamics . in 1934",
    "@xcite , fermi used the zero - range model in quantum mechanical calculations to explain the scattering of slow neutrons off bound hydrogen atoms .",
    "nowadays , the two - body contact interaction is discussed in elementary quantum texts  @xcite .",
    "it has , e.g. , been used to gain insights into the correlations of molecules , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and to model atom - laser interactions  @xcite .    in the 60s",
    "@xcite , zero - range interactions were used extensively to model strongly - interacting one - dimensional systems at zero and finite temperature .",
    "many of these models are relevant to electronic systems where the screening of the long - range coulomb interactions leads to effectively short - range interactions  @xcite .",

    "their incorporation into numerical schemes is not always straightforward . loosely speaking",
    ", the challenge in using zero - range interactions in numerical schemes that work with continuous spatial coordinates stems from the fact that we , in general , do not know how to incorporate the boundary conditions implied by the zero - range potential into numerical approaches at the four- and higher - body level .",
    "this paper discusses an approach that allows for the use of zero - range potentials in many - body simulations .",
    "we work in position space and consider a system with fixed number of particles .",
    "we develop a scheme to incorporate pairwise zero - range interactions into @xmath3 directly , where @xmath4 is the system hamiltonian .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is of fundamental importance .",
    "if @xmath5 is identified with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively , then @xmath3 is the density matrix for the system at finite temperature . knowing the density matrix , the thermodynamic properties can be calculated .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath5 is identified with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the real time , then @xmath3 can be interpreted as the real time propagator and be used to calculate dynamic properties . throughout this paper , we refer to @xmath5 as imaginary time , keeping in mind that @xmath5 carries units of @xmath11 and that @xmath12 can be associated with inverse temperature or real time .",

    "the pair distribution functions for the finite - range and zero - range potentials nearly coincide for large @xmath143 , but differ for small @xmath143 .",
    "the pair distribution function for the gaussian potential drops to 0 as @xmath143 approaches 0 while that for the zero - range potential approaches a non - zero value .",
    "pimc and pigs simulations typically use the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rhotot ] ) as the `` prior distribution '' and the second term as the `` correction '' .",
    "this is suitable for @xmath0-body systems with two - body finite - range potentials for which the scaled pair distribution function is , as that of the non - interacting system ( see the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for a two - body example ) , zero at @xmath195 .",
    "since the prior distribution has zero probability at @xmath195 , the pair distribution function of the system with zero - range interactions is not properly sampled if standard sampling schemes are used .",

    "moreover , the correction term [ see eqs .",
    "( [ 3dtrappeddensitymatrix ] ) and ( [ 3dfreedensitymatrix ] ) ] diverges as @xmath143 or @xmath144 go to 0 .",
    "this means that the probability to sample configurations with @xmath196 is small .",
    "however , if such a configuration is chosen , there is a small probability to accept a new configuration with much larger @xmath143 , i.e. , the correlation length is large .",
    "similarly , if one uses the naive uniform distribution for the prior distribution , i.e. , if one proposes a move for which all cartesian coordinates differ by @xmath104 from the current configuration , where @xmath104 is a random value between @xmath197 and @xmath198 , the problems discussed above still exist .",
    "to remedy the problems that arise if the standard sampling approaches are used , we introduce a `` pair distance move '' for which the prior distribution scales as @xmath199 in the pair distances .",
    "first , particles @xmath19 and @xmath21 and a bead @xmath116 are chosen ( the coordinates for the @xmath116th bead are collectively denoted by @xmath200 ) and the distance @xmath201 and the direction @xmath202 are calculated .",
    "a new vector @xmath203 that lies along @xmath202 or @xmath204 is proposed , @xmath205 .",

    "otherwise , it is rejected and the old configuration is kept .",
    "the value of @xmath210 is adjusted such that about @xmath213 of the proposed moves are accepted .",
    "it can be easily proven that detailed balance is fulfilled .",
    "our pimc calculations for the two - body system with zero - range interactions show that the `` pair distance move '' significantly improves the sampling . without this move ,",
    "the short - range behavior of the pair distribution function has a long correlation length , which increases with decreasing @xmath5 . with this move",
    ", the small @xmath143 behavior is described accurately .",
    "the move described here is related to the compression - dilation move introduced in ref .",
    "few details were given in ref .",
    "@xcite and no comparison with that approach is made in this paper .",
    "we now demonstrate that the outlined sampling scheme provides a reliable description of bose systems at unitarity , which have attracted a great deal of attention recently experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . while the properties of unitary fermi systems with zero - range interactions are fully determined by the @xmath112-wave scattering length  @xcite those of bose systems",
    "additionally depend on a three - body parameter  @xcite . specifically ,",
    "if the two - body interactions are modeled by zero - range potentials , then a three - body regulator is needed to prevent the thomas collapse of the @xmath0-boson ( @xmath214 ) system  @xcite . here , we utilize a purely repulsive three - body potential of the form @xmath215 where @xmath216 denotes the three - body hyperradius , @xmath217 . in the @xmath0-boson system ,",
    "each of the @xmath218 triples feels the regulator , i.e. , the term @xmath219 is added to the hamiltonian with pairwise zero - range interactions . in the absence of an external trap",

    ", it would seem that our goal could be readily achieved using the pigs approach .",
    "it turns out , however , that without a good initial trial wave function , the number of time slices needed to converge the calculations is rather large , making the simulations computationally quite expensive .",
    "instead , one might consider performing pimc calculations at various temperatures and extrapolating to the zero temperature limit .",
    "this approach also turns out to be computationally extensive .",
    "our simulations pursue an alternative approach , in which the scattering states of the system are discretized in such a way that the relative ground state energy @xmath224 of the @xmath0-body cluster is much larger than the energy scale introduced by the discretization .",
    "we utilize a spherically symmetric harmonic trap and adjust the trapping frequency such that @xmath225 .",
    "simulations are then performed at a temperature where the bose droplet is in the ground - state dominated liquid - phase  @xcite , where the finite temperature introduces center - of - mass excitations but not excitations of the relative degrees of freedom .",
    "the temperature @xmath226 at which excitations of the relative degrees of freedom become relevant can be estimated using the `` combined model '' introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as we show now , this approach allows for a fairly robust determination of the @xmath0-boson properties at zero temperature .",
    "we set the trap energy @xmath227 to @xmath228 ( @xmath220 is the ground state energy of the three - boson system in free space ) and the temperature to @xmath229 .",
    "these parameters provide a good compromise : first , the temperature is sufficiently low that finite temperature effects are negligible ( i.e. , @xmath230 for the @xmath0 considered below , @xmath231 ) and high enough that convergence can be reached with the computational resources available to us .",
    "second , the size of the @xmath0-boson system is smaller than the harmonic oscillator length such that structural properties such as the pair distribution function are largely unaffected by the external confinement for @xmath232 .",

    "a more involved decomposition is used  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the standard moves and the `` pair distance move '' , we implement a move that updates the center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "the introduction of this center - of - mass move is motivated by the fact that the relative degrees of freedom are expected to be , to a good approximation , `` frozen '' in the ground state while low - energy center - of - mass excitations are allowed .",
