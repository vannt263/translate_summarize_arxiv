    "then , the conductance @xmath2 of a finite - size sample of dimensions @xmath3 can be found by combining the conductances of its smaller parts , @xmath4 .",
    "this description , however , is applicable only at sufficiently high temperatures , at which the conductivity can be treated as a local quantity .",
    "it was discovered about two decades ago  @xcite that the quantum corrections to the conductivity are non - local on the scale of the ( temperature dependent ) dephasing length @xmath5 , which is much larger than the elastic mean free path .",
    "if the sample is small , or the temperature low , so that @xmath6 exceeds the sample size , the concept of conductivity loses its meaning .",
    "moreover , the conductance @xmath2 acquires significant sample - to - sample fluctuations and can no longer be treated as a self - averaging quantity . for a temperature @xmath7 below the thouless energy @xmath8 , these sample - to - sample fluctuations are of the order of the conductance quantum @xmath9 , independent of sample size or mean free path ( @xmath10 is the time it takes for an electron to diffuse through the system ) .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` universal conductance fluctuations '' ( ucf ) , and it was studied in great detail both theoretically and experimentally , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the lack of self - averaging of the conductance is a feature of _ mesoscopic _ samples , _",
    "i.e. _ , samples with linear dimensions smaller than @xmath5 but still much larger than the fermi wave length .",
    "these ideas that defined the field of mesoscopic physics were initially developed in the context of transport through disordered metals .",
    "a convenient way of creating more controllable mesoscopic samples was developed with the use of semiconductor heterostructures , see @xcite for a review .",
    "as the electron motion in these systems is quantized in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the heterostructure , a two - dimensional electron gas is formed at the interface between the layers . with the help of additional electrostatic confinement , usually in the form of metal gates deposited on top of the hetrostructure , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )",
    "can be tailored to form a finite - size sample , referred to as a quantum dot .",

    ", the number of modes , @xmath11 , is increasing .",
    "if the boundaries of the point contact are smooth on the length scale set by the electron wavelength , then the contact acts as an electron wave guide  @xcite : all the propagating modes , except the one which opened last , do not experience any appreciable backscattering . for the last mode ,",
    "the transmission coefficient varies from @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the crossover from the evanescent to propagating behavior  @xcite . in the specific case of a gate - controlled contact ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the distance between the gate and the depleted edge of the 2deg is typically large compared to the electron wavelength in the electron gas  @xcite .",
    "the curvature radius of the edge of the 2deg at the contact is of the order of this distance , and therefore the smoothness condition is satisfied .",
    "a statistical ensemble of quantum dots can be obtained by slightly varying the shape of the quantum dot , the fermi energy , or the magnetic field , keeping the properties of its contacts to the outside world fixed .",
    "statistical properties of the conductance for such an ensemble depend on the number of modes , @xmath11 , in the junctions and their transparency .",
    "the `` usual '' ucf theory adequately describes the conductance through a disordered or chaotic dot in the limit of large number of modes , @xmath14 .",
    "when all channels in the two point contacts are transparent , the universal value of the root mean square ( r.m.s . )",
    "conductance fluctuations @xmath15 is much smaller than the average conductance @xmath16 .",
    "the distribution of conductances is essentially gaussian , and can be found theoretically by means of the standard diagrammatic expansion for disordered systems  @xcite , or with random matrix theory ( rmt ) , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for reviews . upon closing the point contacts ( _ i.e.",
    "_ , decreasing @xmath11 ) , the average conductance decreases whereas the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations retains its universal value . at @xmath17 , the fluctuations and the average of the conductance are of the same order , and the conductance distribution function is no longer gaussian .",
    "still , if one neglects the interaction between the electrons , the statistics of the conductance can be readily obtained within rmt @xcite .",
    "the rmt of transport through quantum dots can be easily justified for non - interacting electrons",
    ". however , real electrons are charged , and thus interact with each other .",
    "it is known from the theory of bulk disordered systems , that the electron - electron interaction results in corrections to the conductance  @xcite of the order of unit conductance quantum @xmath9 . for a quantum dot connected to a 2deg by single - mode junctions ,",
    "this correction is not small anymore in comparison to the average conductance @xmath18 .",
    "we see that at @xmath19 and low temperatures , both mesoscopic fluctuations and interaction effects become strong .",
    "quantum interference and interaction effects can not be separated , and there is no obvious expansion parameter to use for building a theory describing the statistics of the conductance in this regime .",
    "this paper reviews the current understanding of physical phenomena in a wide class of mesoscopic systems  quantum dots  under the conditions in which effects of electron - electron interaction are strong .",
    "a first step to approach this problem is to disregard the mesoscopic fluctuations altogether .",
    "it means that one neglects the random spatial structure of the wave functions in the dot and the randomness of the energy spectrum ; the discrete energy spectrum with spacing @xmath20 between the one - electron levels in a closed dot is replaced by a continuous spectrum with the corresponding macroscopic density of states . for realistic systems , this approach can be justified sometimes at not - so - low temperatures .",
    "the remaining problem of accounting for the coulomb interaction is non - perturbative at small conductance @xmath21 , and therefore still not trivial .",
    "it constitutes the essence of the so - called coulomb blockade phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb blockade manifests itself most profoundly ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) in oscillations of the dot s conductance @xmath22 with the variation of the voltage @xmath23 on a gate , which is capacitively coupled to the dot , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the resulting dependence @xmath22 exhibits equidistant coulomb blockade peaks separated by deep minima ( coulomb blockade valleys ) .",
    "the peaks occur at the charge degeneracy points , _",
    "i.e. _ , specific values of @xmath23 at which changing the dot charge by a single quantum @xmath24 does not cost any energy .",
    "the idea of the coulomb blockade was suggested in the early experimental paper  @xcite in the late 1960 s , though the term `` coulomb blockade '' was coined only two decades later  @xcite . a quantitative theory in terms of rate equations describing the transport through a blockaded quantum dot or metal grain at @xmath25 ,",
    "was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was generalized to systems with a controllable gate in ref .",
    "this theory is commonly referred to as the `` orthodox theory '' .",
    "the main conclusion of the orthodox theory is that the conductance through a blockaded grain at low temperatures is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the first experiments on gated metallic coulomb blockade systems were reported in ref .",

    "quantum fluctuations affect both transport properties ( such as linear conductance and @xmath29-@xmath30 characteristics ) and thermodynamics ( _ e.g. _ , differential capacitance ) .",
    "the @xmath29-@xmath30 characteristic in the coulomb blockade valleys at relatively small conductance was considered in  @xcite in second order perturbation theory in @xmath2 ; later the corresponding non - linear contribution to the current found in  @xcite became known as `` inelastic co - tunneling ''  @xcite .",
    "corrections induced by charge fluctuations at @xmath31 were calculated in  @xcite for the thermodynamic characteristics , and in  @xcite for the linear conductance . at @xmath31 the problem of quantum charge fluctuations was mapped  @xcite on the multi - channel kondo problem  @xcite , which in some cases can be solved exactly  @xcite .",
    "another limit which allows for a comprehensive solution , is the case of a point contact with one almost open conducting channel linking the dot to the lead ( conductance @xmath2 is close to the conductance quantum )  @xcite . in this limit , and still neglecting mesoscopic fluctuations ( @xmath32 ) , the coulomb blockade almost vanishes : the contribution periodic in the gate voltage @xmath23 to the differential capacitance , which is the prime signature of coulomb blockade , is small compared to the average capacitance  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown within this model that the coulomb blockade disappears completely in the case where the channel is fully transparent .    in all of the aforementioned works the effects of mesoscopic fluctuations , associated with the finite size and the discrete energy spectrum of the isolated dot ( nonzero level spacing @xmath20 ) ,",
    "were ignored .",
    "however , these fluctuations drastically affect the results . in open dots ,",
    "mesoscopic fluctuations reinstate periodic oscillations of the differential capacitance and conductance as a function of the gate voltage @xmath33 , as a remnant the charge discreteness in the dot , even in the limit of completely transparent channels in the point contacts .",
    "if the dot is almost closed , the chaotic nature of the wave functions in the dot gives rise to mesoscopic fluctuations of observable quantities .",
    "both in the coulomb blockade valleys and at the peaks , the conductance turns out to have large fluctuations , and is very sensitive to a magnetic field .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to review the rich variety of effects associated with the finite level spacing @xmath20 , the chaotic nature of the wave functions , and the coulomb interaction for both closed and open dots .",
