    "for comparison , over the same area , there are about 15 million objects detected in the @xmath34 band above 6-@xmath57 , and about 6.5 million cosmic ray hits in the @xmath34 band .",
    "the quasars are faint , with low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) photometry from the sdss imaging data .",
    "therefore , the key to a successful selection process is an efficient elimination of potential contaminants .",
    "we face three technical challenges :    \\(1 ) elimination of false @xmath34-band only detections , composed primarily of cosmic rays , but also including satellite trails , electronic ghost images and bleed trails from bright stars .",
    "while the recognition of the majority of cosmic rays is relatively straightforward , even a tiny fraction of mis - classified cosmic rays in the @xmath34 band , which would then appear as @xmath0-dropout candidates , would dominate over the much rarer true quasars .",
    "note that sdss scans the sky only once in the course of the survey except in a small fraction of overlapping area ; thus repeat observations can not be used to recognize cosmic rays . moreover ,",
    "sdss uses thick ccds for the @xmath34 band .",
    "a cosmic ray hit on these thick devices typically occupies more than a single pixel , making the separation of real detections from cosmic ray hits more difficult , especially when the seeing is good .",

    "2001 , leggett et al .",
    "2001 ) , is @xmath60 times higher than that of @xmath43 quasars .",
    "we use @xmath6-band photometry to separate these two classes of objects ( see below , also fan et al .  2000b , zheng et al .",
    "2000 ) .      because of the rarity of high - redshift quasars , and the overwhelming number of contaminants , our photometric selection procedure of @xmath43 quasar candidates is quite involved , and includes five separate steps :    \\1 .",
    "selection of @xmath0-dropout sources from the sdss database .",
    "\\2 . running an improved cosmic ray classifier and visually inspecting all remaining candidates to reduce the number of false candidates due to cosmic rays .",
    "\\3 . matching the candidate list to the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) in the public release area of 2mass , to obtain @xmath61 photometry .",
    "independent @xmath34 photometry to further eliminate false and biased @xmath34 detections .",
    "@xmath6-band photometry of objects not in 2mass to separate quasar and cool dwarf candidates .",
    "this then leaves us with a sample for follow - up spectroscopy .    in this and the subsequent section",
    ", we describe this process in detail .",
    "the techniques and rationale for these various cuts are described in the present section , while the observations themselves are described in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "the sdss photometric data are processed by a series of automated pipelines to carry out astrometric and photometric measurements .",
    "the photometric pipeline ( _ photo _ , @xcite ) reduces the data from the imaging camera and produces corrected images and object catalogs .",
    "_ photo _ classifies detected objects either as `` star '' ( point source , consistent with the point spread function , psf ) or `` galaxy '' ( extended source ) .",
    "however , we select all @xmath0-dropout objects irrespective of their star - galaxy classification , as the star - galaxy separation becomes less reliable at low s / n .",
    "cosmic rays are recognized as objects with profile gradients significantly steeper than that of the psf , and are interpolated over ; they are not output explicitly by the pipeline . while _",
    "photo _ classifies more than 99.9% of the cosmic rays correctly , visual inspection shows that a majority of objects with @xmath34-only detections that are classified as `` stars '' still have the appearance of cosmic rays .",
    "this is further confirmed by comparing those areas of the sky with multiple observations .",
    "therefore , we have recently improved the performance of the object classifier , as follows .    for every object detected by the imaging pipeline",
    ", we count the pixels in an @xmath62 pixel region ( @xmath63 ) centered on the object , for which @xmath64 \\over i(0 ) - c*n[i(0)]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the object s central intensity , @xmath66 is the intensity of the pixel in question , psf(0 ) and psf(@xmath67 ) are the equivalent quantities for the locally - determined model of the psf , the noise @xmath68 is the photon noise with an additional @xmath69 added in quadrature , and @xmath70 .",
    "this criterion searches for objects with profile gradients significantly sharper than that of the psf .",
    "if more than 3 pixels satisfy this condition , we consider the object to be a candidate cosmic ray , and reject it .",
    "the photometric pipeline assigns detailed flags for each detected object , indicating objects whose photometry ( and therefore , colors ) may be in error .",
    "we reject objects flagged as being saturated in any band , lying on the bleed trail of a saturated star , or overlapping the edge of the image boundary .",
    "we pay close attention to objects blended with close neighbors , and reject deblended children with peakcenter , notchecked , or deblend_nopeak set in the @xmath0 and @xmath34 bands , which are typical signs of deblending problems . for a complete description of the definition of flags ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the flag - checking procedure used here is similar to that used in the sdss quasar target selection pipeline ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have re - classified all the objects with @xmath54 using the new cosmic ray classifier . we found that depending on the seeing of a specific run , @xmath71 to @xmath72 of the @xmath0-dropout objects formerly classified as `` stars '' are now classified as cosmic rays , while a negligible fraction of the `` real '' objects ( based on multiple observations and objects with confirmed spectra ) are mis - classified as `` cosmic rays '' .",
    "we then visually inspect the @xmath34 images of the remaining candidates , and reject a further 25% as cosmic rays and other artifacts .",
    "after the improved cosmic ray rejection and visual inspection , we carry out independent follow - up @xmath34 photometry of all the remaining candidates ( of which there are 121 ; see below ) using the apache point 3.5 m and other telescopes ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "this serves two purposes : ( a ) to confirm that the objects are indeed real ; and ( b ) to measure the @xmath39 magnitude more accurately .",
    "since our @xmath0-dropout candidates have the reddest @xmath52 colors , we tend to pick up objects lying on the several @xmath57 tail of the @xmath39 error distribution ( note that the @xmath34-band only objects are very faint , and therefore are measured at low s / n ) ; they will thus have artificially red @xmath52 color and blue @xmath73 color , and are more likely to be selected as @xmath43 quasar candidates ( see below ) . to include those objects in the sample would lower our spectroscopic success rate considerably .      as discussed by fan et al  ( 2000b ) and zheng et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and illustrated in figure 1 , the major astrophysical contaminants of @xmath0-dropout quasars are very cool dwarfs with spectral types l and t ( strauss et al .  1999 ,",

    "figure 2 presents the @xmath52 vs. @xmath73 color - color diagram of the @xmath0-dropout sample .",
    "finlator et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have matched the sdss photometric catalog in @xmath76 deg@xmath2 with that of 2mass in the @xmath61 bands .",
    "the small dots in figure 2 show the sdss-2mass matches and indicate the location of normal stars on this color - color diagram .",
    "the track of quasar colors shows that by using @xmath77 , @xmath0-dropout cool dwarfs and high - redshift quasars are clearly separated , as the @xmath78 color of high - redshift quasars is dominated by the blue power law continuum , while the cool temperature of l / t dwarfs results in very red @xmath79 color , typically larger than 2 .",
    "therefore we determine whether the candidate has been detected by 2mass .",
    "while the non - detection of a faint candidate by 2mass does not give a tight constraint on the spectral shape of the object , most of the brighter objects ( @xmath80 ) that are located in the area of the 2mass publicly released data are indeed detected by 2mass , with @xmath81 , indicating that most of them are cool dwarfs .",
    "for those not matched with 2mass , we carry out follow - up @xmath6-band photometry ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the final photometric selection criteria for this survey are :    @xmath82    we also require that the object not be detected in any of the other three bands @xmath83 and @xmath33 .    the magnitudes and colors in eq .",

    "this is a small effect , which has been taken into account in the selection function calculation (  5.1 ) . in the selection ,",
    "only objects with s / n @xmath84 in the @xmath34 band are considered ( item [ b ] ) , as the @xmath85 color becomes very unreliable for the faintest sources and would have selected many more candidates with a more inclusive cut .",

    "the @xmath252-folding timescale for black hole growth is @xmath253 yr , where @xmath254 is the ratio of the quasar bolometric luminosity to the eddington luminosity , and @xmath255 is the radiation efficiency . for sdss 0836 + 0054 , the most luminous quasar in our sample , it takes 20@xmath90 @xmath252-folding times , or @xmath256 gyr , to grow from a 10 @xmath257 stellar black hole , if @xmath258 .",
    "this timescale is very close to the age of the universe at @xmath42 in the @xmath44-model .",
    "if @xmath259 , it is actually _ longer _ than the age of the universe in the @xmath48 model .",
    "note that the black hole could grow much faster if the radiation efficiency is very low .",
    "alternatively , the black hole could have formed from a much more massive seed black hole , such as a very massive object in population iii ( vmos ; bond , arnett & carr 1984 ) , or from mergers of smaller black holes ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 1999 ; menou , haiman , & narayanan 2001 ) .",
    "the quasar luminosity function at high redshift is a sensitive test of cosmological parameters and models of quasar evolution .",
    "the observed luminous quasars most probably represent rare peaks in the density field at @xmath215 , and hence probe the exponential , high - mass tail of the underlying dark matter halo distribution .",
    "the slope of the luminosity function is determined by both the slope of the halo mass function and the relation between black hole mass ( proportional to quasar luminosity if the quasar is radiating at the eddington limit ) and dark halo mass .",
    "the @xmath27 quasars presented in this paper are extremely rare objects , representing many-@xmath57 peaks in the density field .",
    "one would therefore expect their luminosity function to be very steep .",
    "we use the luminosity distribution of the four quasars in our sample to constrain the slope of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function , and compare it with theoretical expectations , assuming that the fluxes of the four observed quasars are not significantly magnified by gravitational lensing .    among the four quasars in the complete sample in table 5 , two have @xmath206 ( @xmath48 model ) .",
    "we use this as a constraint to calculate the expected number of fainter quasars in the survey area , assuming a power law luminosity function , @xmath260 , and taking into account the survey selection function presented in figure 8 .",
    "we then compare this expected number with the actual number of lower - luminosity quasars observed ( two at @xmath261 ) . for @xmath262 , we expect to find less than six quasars at @xmath263 in our survey . in this case , the probability of observing fewer than three lower luminosity quasars is larger than 5% ( assuming poisson statistics ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath262 is consistent with the observed distribution at greater than the 2-@xmath57 level .",
    "note that this constraint encompasses the values of the bright - end slope of the quasar luminosity function from fan et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , who found @xmath264 using a sample of quasars at @xmath209 , and boyle et al . ( 2000 ) , who found @xmath265 at @xmath266 .",
    "however , the observed luminosity distribution is not consistent with an even steeper luminosity function .",
    "the probability drops to 0.01 for @xmath267 , and to 0.001 for @xmath268 .",
    "in other words , a steep quasar luminosity function with @xmath269 is ruled out at the @xmath270-@xmath57 level by the current observations .",
    "this constraint simply reflects the fact that even after taking into account the lower selection completeness of the survey at the faint end , there are not many lower luminosity quasars in our survey at @xmath27 ( only two are observed ) , given that we have discovered two bright ones ( @xmath206 , @xmath271 ) .",
    "we note that this constraint on the slope of the bright end of the luminosity function is quite weak , as it is based on only four objects , and depends strongly on our model of the survey selection function and the assumption that the observed quasars are not significantly magnified by gravitational lensing . in order to obtain a stronger constraint on the slope of the luminosity function , a large , and more importantly ,",
    "a deeper sample of @xmath272 quasars is needed .",
    "is this constraint on the bright end slope of the quasar luminosity function consistent with a simple model of quasar evolution ?",
    "we can answer this question in the context of specific models of quasar formation .",
    "following haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) , we assume that there is a monotonic relation between quasar luminosity at high redshift and the mass of the dark matter halo in which it resides , and assume further that every black hole shines as a quasar for a given fraction of the age of the universe to that redshift ( the `` lifetime '' or `` duty cycle '' of the quasar ) .",
    "we can then match the observed quasar number density at @xmath17 to the number density of dark matter halos found in the hubble - volume simulations ( jenkins et al .",
    "2000 ) , if we assume that the quasars in our sample are associated with dark matter halos more massive than @xmath273m@xmath274 . in this case",
    ", the dark halo mass function at this mass scale has a logarithmic slope between @xmath275 and @xmath276 , depending on the cosmology and quasar life time ( @xmath277 years ) .",
    "note that this minimum halo mass is comparable to that estimated using the @xmath278 relation of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , assuming that the quasars radiate at the eddington limit .",
    "these luminous quasars represent about 5-@xmath57 peaks in the density field for a @xmath44-cdm power spectrum , and the mass function is extremely steep at this mass .",
    "the slope of the dark halo mass function is steeper than that of the quasar luminosity function @xmath279 .",
    "this difference in the slopes of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function and the dark halo mass function at the corresponding mass scale implies that for high - redshift quasars , the luminosity @xmath280 can not simply scale linearly with @xmath281 ; rather , high - mass black holes radiate more efficiently than do lower mass ones .",
    "alternatively , the quasar luminosity function can be shallower than the mass function if there is large scatter in the @xmath282 relation , or if the fluxes of the observed quasars have been significantly amplified by gravitational lensing . clearly , the above results are oversimplified and are based on a number of assumptions regarding both quasar activity and the correspondence between quasar luminosity and the mass of the dark matter halo in which it resides .",
    "however , they illustrate the importance of the measurement of the shape of the quasar luminosity function in constraining models of quasar formation and evolution .",
    "the absence of the gunn - peterson trough in sdss 1306 + 0356 ( @xmath8 ) indicates that the universe is still highly ionized at @xmath283 , presumably by the ionizing photons from quasars and star - forming galaxies .",

    "( 1999 ) conclude that quasars alone do not provide enough ionizing photons to keep the universe ionized at @xmath129 , and that the major contribution to the cosmic ionizing background has to be produced by star - forming galaxies ( see also @xcite ) . here",

    "we calculate the total emissivity per unit comoving volume of ionizing photons from the quasar population : @xmath287 where @xmath288 is the total quasar emissivity at 1450 , with units of erg s@xmath20 hz@xmath20 mpc@xmath23 , assuming a luminosity function @xmath289 @xmath290 and @xmath291 is the total number of ionizing photons for a source with a luminosity of 1 erg s@xmath20 hz@xmath20 at 1450 .",
    "we assume the quasar sed following madau , haardt , & rees ( 1999 ) . @xmath292 and integrate over the energy range from 1 to 4 rydberg , with a cutoff at 4 rydberg because of heii absorption .",
    "we assume that the luminosity function of quasars at @xmath27 is described by a double power law , and write it as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath192 : @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the characteristic luminosity .",

    "the quasar ionizing photon density is compared with what is required to keep the universe ionized at @xmath27 ( heavy solid line ) .    from figure 10 ,",
    "it is evident that with @xmath305 , quasars would not produce enough photons to keep the universe ionized at @xmath27 , unless @xmath306 , i.e. , only if the ionizing background is dominated by low luminosity agns can the quasar luminosity function provide enough ionizing photons .",
    "this would imply a large negative luminosity evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "the universe could be ionized with luminous quasars only if the bright end slope of the luminosity function were much steeper than that measured at low redshift ; but such a steeper slope is not consistent with our sample .",
    "this calculation underlines the importance of searching for faint quasars and studying the shape of the high - redshift quasar luminosity function at the low luminosity end .",
    "while it is unlikely that quasars provide the majority of photons that ionized the universe at @xmath307 , it still remains an open question .",
