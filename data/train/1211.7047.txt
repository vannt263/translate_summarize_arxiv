    "the translocation of a polymer through a nano - sized pore occurs as a part of many biological processes and functions , such as dna and rna translocation through nuclear pores , protein transport across membrane channels and virus injection  @xcite .",
    "the translocation process is also envisioned to have several biotechnological applications , including rapid dna sequencing , gene therapy and controlled drug delivery  @xcite .",
    "recently , the hope of realizing a third generation dna sequencing method using nanopore sequencing devices has prompted rapid advancement in experimental methods and in technological applications  @xcite , leading to commercialization of the nanopore sequencing technology in the near future  @xcite .    however , despite the technological advances and considerable experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite efforts to understand the basic process , until very recently the fundamental physics of driven polymer translocation has remained elusive .",
    "the first attempts to model polymer translocation theoretically were made by sung and park  @xcite and later by muthukumar  @xcite , who viewed polymer translocation as a one - dimensional barrier crossing problem of the translocation coordinate @xmath0 ( the length of the subchain on the _ trans _ side ) , with the activation barrier determined by the free energy of the polymer derived from equilibrium enumeration of random walks . however , if the process is facilitated by an external bias , the process is inherently out of equilibrium due to the long relaxation time of the polymer chain .",
    "this fact was first recognized by kantor and kardar  @xcite , and was later studied extensively in simulations  @xcite , with chain lengths and driving forces in the typical experimental regime . it was observed that with increasing driving force , significant non - equilibrium effects come into play  @xcite .",
    "the driven translocation problem was also studied by several authors with different approaches , such as the fractional fokker - planck method by metzler and klafter  @xcite , scaling theory supplemented with the fractional fokker - planck method by dubbeldam et al .",
    "@xcite and by vocks et al . using a method based on local memory effects near the pore  @xcite .",
    "however , the first truly non - equilibrium treatment was given by sakaue , using an ingenious tension propagation theory based on force balance , mass conservation and self - similarity of the polymer  @xcite .",
    "however , the theory was solved in the asymptotic limit of long chains , neglecting , e.g. , the interaction between the pore and the polymer .",
    "it was pointed out already by storm et al .",
    "@xcite that this interaction may significantly alter the dynamics of driven translocation , which was further demonstrated in simulations  @xcite .",
    "hence , the agreement of the theories with experiments and simulations remained modest .",
    "recently  @xcite , we have generalized sakaue s tension propagation ( tp ) model of driven translocation for finite chain lengths and included the pore - polymer interaction as an additional friction force .",
    "it was shown that the model is in excellent agreement with high - accuracy molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "in addition , we showed that due to the pore friction and finite size corrections to the tension propagation equations , the asymptotic limit is well beyond the present computational capabilities and simulation algorithms .",
    "for example , the scaling exponent @xmath1 , which relates the mean translocation time @xmath2 to the chain length @xmath3 as @xmath4 , actually retains a fairly strong dependence on the chain length even up to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the scatter ( non - universality ) of @xmath1 , widely studied and reported in the literature , is in fact a finite chain length effect .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study further the non - universalities in driven polymer translocation brought on by finite chain length effects , and to see how the asymptotic limit is approached in different regimes . to this end",
    ", we use a combination of theoretical methods and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . for the former",
    ", we use the theoretical brownian dynamics tension propagation ( bdtp ) model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the tension propagation description and incorporates the finite size effects , and for the latter , we use full @xmath3-particle langevin thermostatted md simulations .",
    "the bdtp model and its numerical solution is described in section  [ sec : model ] , while the details of the md simulations are included in appendix a.    the central assumption of the tension propagation theory is that the effect of the _ trans _ side subchain on the non - equilibrium dynamics is small , and therefore its contribution to the effective total friction is neglected .",
    "this approximation is very good in the parameter regime typically used in experiments and simulations .",
    "however , in certain cases , the influence of the _ trans _ side chain on the dynamics may be non - negligible .",
    "therefore , we do not expect perfect agreement with the bdtp model and the md simulations .",
    "the limitations of the model are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "however , it will be shown that for most relevant situations , the bdtp model gives extremely good match with md .",
    "in addition , it allows one to go beyond the chain length regime available to md simulations ( @xmath6 for high driving force ) , and to see how the finite chain length effects diminish as the asymptotic limit is approached .",
    "in addition , in section  [ sec : results ] , we present detailed comparison between the theory and md simulations for the time evolution of the translocation coordinate @xmath7 , the scaling of translocation time with the driving force and the monomer waiting time distribution . in our previous work",
    "we have explained and demonstrated the applicability of the bdtp model to both two and three dimensional systems  @xcite . in this work",
    "we provide new results for three dimensional geometry , some of which are directly relevant to gain better understanding of the experimental results for dna translocation through nanopore .",
    "we also relate our findings to previous md simulations found in the literature , and to the theories of refs .",
    "the purpose of the bdtp model is to present a coarse - grained , minimal model of driven polymer translocation  @xcite .",
    "since the driven translocation is a complex , non - equilibrium dynamical process , the rigorous solution of the full problem from first principles seems impossible at present .",
    "instead , the bdtp model presents a phenomenological description , which interpolates between the low - force and high - force regimes . in the low - force regime , the fluctuations and the chain entropy become important .",
    "hence , as a general framework , we adopt the description used by sung and park  @xcite and muthukumar  @xcite , the one - dimensional barrier crossing problem of the translocation coordinate @xmath0 . here , the chain starts from the _ cis _ side with one end inside the pore and is considered as translocated once @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the segment length .",
    "the free - energy due to chain entropy and the chemical potential difference @xmath10 is @xmath11 + \\frac{s}{a}\\delta\\mu.$ ] here @xmath12 is the surface exponent ( @xmath13 for an ideal chain , and a self - avoiding chain in 2d and 3d , respectively ) , and @xmath14 is the thermal energy . from @xmath15 ,",
    "the brownian dynamics equation for @xmath0 in the overdamped limit follows as @xmath16 - \\frac{\\delta\\mu}{a } + \\zeta(t).$ ] here @xmath17 is the effective friction , and @xmath18 is gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this framework ,",
    "the non - equilibrium memory effects at larger driving forces are then taken into account by allowing the effective friction to depend on time , @xmath21 .",
    "this time - dependence is then solved from the tension propagation ( tp ) formalism .",
    "the central idea of the tension propagation theory is to divide the subchain on the _ cis _ side into two distinct domains  @xcite .",
    "the first domain , closer to the pore , consists of all the monomers that are pulled towards the pore by the external driving force .",
    "the second domain consists of the remaining monomers , which are at rest ( on the average ) .",
    "as the driving force is applied at the pore , the chain begins to move in stages , with the segments closest to the pore being set into motion first .",
    "a close analogue is a coil of rope pulled from one end , which first has to uncoil and become tense before starting to move as a whole . to keep track of the moving part of the chain",
    ", one defines a _ tension front _ , which divides the chain into the moving and nonmoving domains .",
    "the front propagates in time as parts of the chain further away from the pore are set in motion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : configuration ] . as the monomers enter the front and start to move , the effective friction @xmath22 increases due to the increased drag between the polymer and the solvent . after a certain tension propagation time ,",
    "@xmath23 , the front reaches the end of the chain and the tension propagation process stops . after this time , the chain as a whole is pulled towards the pore . during this stage , the overall length of the subchain on the _ cis _ side decreases , which reduces the effective friction @xmath22 .",
    "this stage continues until the last monomer reaches the pore and finally translocates at time @xmath24 .      in the bdtp model",
    ", the translocation process is described using only two degrees of freedom .",
    "the first one , the translocation coordinate @xmath0 , describes the chain s position with respect to the pore , while the second one , the location of the tension front @xmath25 , describes the response of the _ cis _ side chain to the driving force . to both of these degrees of freedom one",
    "has a corresponding equation of motion , which are coupled via the effective friction @xmath17 . in the extremely high driving force limit ,",
    "the location of the tension front can be described by only one equation , while in the more general case considered in this work , one needs to solve a system of several equations .",
    "the derivation of the bdtp model is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and the tension propagation theory in refs .",
    "@xcite . therefore ,",
    "in this work we do not reiterate the full derivation of the model , but rather present the resulting equations and outline the method of their numerical solution .    for convenience ,",
    "we first introduce dimensionless units denoted by the tilde symbol as @xmath26 , with the unit of length @xmath27 , force @xmath28 , time @xmath29 , velocity @xmath30 and friction @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the solvent friction per monomer . in these units ,",
    "the brownian dynamics equation for @xmath33 reads @xmath34 + \\tilde{f } + \\tilde{\\zeta}(\\tilde{t } ) \\equiv \\tilde{f}_\\mathrm{tot } , \\label{eq : motion_dimless}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and , for simplicity , we have assumed that the pore length @xmath36 .",
    "generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_dimless ] ) to different pore lengths is straightforward ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar case ) .",
    "the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_dimless ] ) is essentially determined by the effective friction @xmath22 , which therefore must comprise all the dominant contributions of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the full polymer chain .",
    "although under sufficiently large @xmath37 , also the _ trans _ side subchain assumes a highly out - of - equilibrium configuration , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that for most cases the influence of the _ trans _ side chain on the dynamics is extremely small .",
    "this matter will also be further elucidated in section  [ sec : results ] of this work .",
    "therefore , to a very good approximation it is sufficient to consider the drag force due to the _ cis _ side subchain and the frictional interaction between the pore and the polymer .",
    "although the latter is negligible for infinitely long chains , it can significantly change the dynamics for finite chains .",
    "formally , we can write @xmath22 as the sum of the _ cis _ side subchain and pore frictions , @xmath38 . the first contribution can be calculated from the tension propagation formalism , while the pore friction @xmath39 has to be determined empirically . in the special case of extremely large driving force",
    ", one can find @xmath40 explicitly from the tp equations  @xcite .",
    "more generally , however , it is easier to derive the velocity of the monomers at the pore entrance , @xmath41 .",
    "in such a case , the effective friction is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the line density of monomers near the pore and @xmath44 is the flux of monomers through the pore entrance . in either case , determining @xmath45 essentially reduces to calculating the number of moving monomers , whose combined drag force then constitutes the time - dependent part of the friction .    for moderate driving forces ( to be defined rigorously below ) the chain on the _ cis _ side assumes a trumpet - like shape due to the higher stretching close to the point of action of the driving force .",
    "in this so - called trumpet ( tr ) regime , the line density near the pore is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the force at the pore entrance  @xcite . to solve the velocity @xmath41 , one needs to solve a system of four equations : @xmath48^{-1 } ,   \\label{eq : motionr}\\ ] ] @xmath49 , \\label{eq : xir}\\ ] ] @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the flory exponent , @xmath53 relates the chain end - to - end distance to its contour length as @xmath54 . from md simulations we have measured @xmath55 in three dimensions .",

    "the essential requirements are that the profile is non - constant , goes to zero at the tension front ( @xmath67 ) , and allows the global conservation of mass .      to solve the model numerically , we first set the initial values for the translocation coordinate @xmath68 and the location of the tension front @xmath69 . in the initial configuration ,",

    ", we still need to determine the pore friction @xmath81 .",
    "because @xmath81 characterizes the interactions between the pore and the polymer chain , we do not expect it to have any universal value .",

    "appendix a ) .",
    "the same approach has been used widely in the literature for md simulations of polymer translocation  @xcite . while it is possible to determine the pore friction also from experimental data , in this work we only consider the numerical pores used in our benchmark md simulations .    to determine @xmath81",

    "where the tension front @xmath69 is still close to the pore , the friction in the system is largely determined by the friction between the pore and the polymer , giving the most accurate estimate for @xmath81 . in practice , we look at the waiting time per monomer @xmath82 , defined as the time that the individual monomer spends inside the pore . with @xmath37 sufficiently large , @xmath83 . for small @xmath68 , the friction @xmath22 and @xmath84",

    "will be discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , it should be noted that for each pore geometry , @xmath81 is fitted only once , as opposed to being done separately for each combination of @xmath87 , etc .",
    "thus , @xmath81 is not a freely adjustable parameter , but is a property of the pore .",
    "we begin the analysis of the results by looking at the waiting time @xmath82 of individual monomers .",
    "we do this by solving the bdtp model with parameters typical for molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( 3d ) and pore friction @xmath92 , corresponding to the pore geometry used in , e.g. , ref .",
    "the resulting waiting time distribution is an important measure of translocation dynamics .",
    "previously , we have shown that the waiting time distribution is reproduced almost exactly by the bdtp model as compared to md simulations in 2d and 3d  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the shape of the waiting time distribution is non - monotonic , with the initial part of increasing waiting time @xmath82 describing the tension propagation stage , and the second part of decreasing @xmath82 being the tail retraction stage ( cf .",
    "[ fig : wt128_3d ] ) .",
    "it is reassuring to note that the normalized waiting time distribution for @xmath93 looks very similar to that for @xmath94 for the same parameters reported earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite .    between the two stages is the maximum of @xmath82 , i.e. , the moment of maximum friction @xmath22 , which occurs when the tension front reaches the @xmath3:th monomer of the chain . for sufficiently large @xmath3 ,",
    "the translocation velocity is , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v0_tr ] ) and  ( [ eq : v0_sf ] ) , @xmath95 . immediately after the tension propagation stage ,",
    "the location of the tension front is @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the maximum waiting time , @xmath97 , should scale with chain length as @xmath98^{-1 } \\propto n_0^\\nu$ ] .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wt_collapse ] , which displays the collapse of the waiting time distributions for different @xmath3 onto a single master curve . since the area under the @xmath82 curve gives the average translocation time , one has @xmath4 with @xmath99 .",
    "however , even for @xmath100 , the location of @xmath97 slowly moves to the right and the collapse to the master curve is not exact .",
    "this shows that the chain length @xmath100 is still not in the asymptotic limit !",
    "consequently , for @xmath100 , the scaling of the average translocation time is also not exactly @xmath101 , as we will discuss below .",
    "previously the bdtp model has been compared with md simulations in several regimes , and has been shown to reproduce the correct dependence of the average translocation time @xmath2 on the chain length @xmath3 within the numerical accuracy  @xcite .",
    "some of the results are gathered in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] , where we show the translocation time exponent @xmath1 ( defined via @xmath4 ) for both the bdtp model and md simulations .",
    "the figure shows that merely by using the same numerical values for the parameters in the bdtp model and in the md simulations , the md results are reproduced by the theory with good accuracy .",
    "it is also clear that the numerical value of @xmath1 depends on several parameters such as chain length , driving force , friction and pore structure .",
    "however , as shown by our analysis of the waiting time distribution @xmath82 and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , all the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] are in the finite chain length regime .",
    "therefore , the apparent non - universality of @xmath1 is not surprising . to further study the finite size effects , we look at the dependence of @xmath2 on the chain length @xmath3 , first for different driving forces @xmath37 and then for different pore geometries by varying the dimensionless pore friction @xmath39 .",
    "to study the dependence of the average translocation time @xmath2 on the chain length @xmath3 , we define the effective ( running ) exponent @xmath102 . in the finite chain length regime ,",
    "the effective @xmath103 is a function of the chain length and approaches the asymptotic value for long chains . in fig .",

    "the exponent @xmath103 shows clear dependence not only on the chain length , but also on the driving force @xmath105 .",
    "this is a clear indication of non - equilibrium behavior and finite chain length effects .",

    "[ fig : alpha_different_forces ] .",
    "however , the approach is extremely slow : within the numerical accuracy of the bdtp model , the asymptotic value is not reached until @xmath107 .    another interesting fact is the dependence of @xmath1 on the driving force @xmath105 .",
    "our results show that as @xmath105 is increased , @xmath1 decreases for any fixed chain length @xmath108 .",

    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "md simulation studies by lehtola et al .",
    "@xcite and more recently by dubbeldam et al .",
    "@xcite report the exactly opposite behavior that @xmath1 increases with @xmath105 .",
    "however , we argue that neither of these studies corresponds to the canonical driven translocation problem , where the chain starts initially on the _ cis _ side and may either successfully translocate or slip back to the _ cis _ side , depending on the fluctuations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the low - force simulations were performed by placing the polymer chain initially halfway through the pore to facilitate successful translocations  @xcite .",
    "because of the intrinsic non - equilibrium nature of driven translocation , this approach does not give results that can be directly compared with theory or experiments , where the process always starts with the whole chain initially on the _ cis _ side .",
    "@xcite , another method was used to make the low - force simulations possible . here , the authors prevented the chain from escaping back to the _ cis _ side by making the first monomer too large to fit through the pore .",
    "this is equivalent to enforcing an artificial reflecting boundary condition on the first monomer that prevents the escape .",
    "although such a boundary condition has been used several times in the literature , it fundamentally changes the system s behavior in the low - force limit , as we will discuss below .      in the finite chain length regime , it is conceivable that the translocation dynamics is affected by the local neighborhood of the pore .",
    "the effect of the pore size and geometry has been previously studied with md simulations in , e.g. , refs .",
    "it has been shown that the exponent @xmath1 depends on the details of the pore , although no systematic study on the nature of the dependence has been performed . in the bdtp model ,",
    "the effect of pore geometry is mapped into one parameter , the pore friction @xmath81 . to study the effect of local pore geometry , we have measured @xmath81 for different pore diameters @xmath109 by running md simulations ( for details ,",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pore_friction ] . for the smaller pore ,",
    "the interactions between the pore and the polymer are stronger , with @xmath81 increasing rapidly as the diameter of the pore approaches the size of the monomer .",
    "in addition to the friction between the pore walls and the polymer , @xmath81 includes the effective drag force of the monomers inside the pore and in its immediate vicinity .",
    "the latter constitutes a non - vanishing contribution to the pore friction , and is extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig : pore_friction ] by collapsing the data for different @xmath32 on a single master curve .",
    "empirically , the total pore friction is thus approximately given by @xmath110 , where the first term describes the interaction between the pore walls and the polymer , and is similar in form to the one used by storm et al .",
    "the factor @xmath111 is given by the energy ( @xmath112 ) and length scale ( @xmath113 ) of the lennard - jones interaction and the monomer mass @xmath114 ( see appendix a ) as @xmath115 .",
    "the numerical values may depend on the specific geometry ( triangular lattice vs. square lattice , pore length @xmath116 , etc . ) .    in fig .",

    "the size of the pore affects the translocation dynamics only slightly .",
    "this is because for long chains , the overall friction of the system is dominated by the friction between _ cis _ side subchain and the solvent , with the pore friction adding only a minor contribution . for shorter chains",
    ", however , the exponent @xmath1 clearly decreases with decreasing pore size . for short chains and narrow pores",

    "[ fig : alpha_gp ] indicates that for typical parameters and in the chain length regime relevant for simulations and experiments , the pore friction @xmath39 can be a major contribution to the total friction and significantly changes the translocation dynamics .",

    "in addition , we have studied the effect of solvent viscosity by running simulations with @xmath139 and the effect of bond strength by using a fene spring constant @xmath140 ( hard bonds ) and @xmath141 ( soft bonds ) .",
    "the results of the md simulations are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_bdtp ] .",

    "the reason for the former is that for very low friction , the response of the system to the force is not linear due to the inertial term in the equations of motion ( see appendix a ) . when the friction is increased , the mass term becomes less significant and the exponent @xmath121 decreases .",
    "similarly , for extremely high forces and small @xmath144 , the bonds can be significantly stretched by the driving force .",

    "the effect should be small , because the high friction due to the long tail on the _ cis _ side leads to slow translocation even for large @xmath105 , and the friction due to crowding becomes less significant .      finally , we look at the time evolution of the translocation coordinate @xmath146 . in fig .

    "the time - dependence of @xmath68 can also be characterized by the scaling exponent @xmath149 , which we define as @xmath150 is sometimes defined through @xmath151 .",

    "the relation can be exact only in the asymptotic limit @xmath159 , since for finite chain lengths , the scaling @xmath160 is not exact , as shown in fig .",

    "for @xmath155 we have measured @xmath165 , with the value still gradually decreasing towards 1 . in the finite chain length regime ,",
    "the bdtp model is in excellent agreement with the available md simulation data .",
    "for @xmath152 we have on the average @xmath166 , which matches exactly with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , we look at the fluctuations of the bdtp model . to do this , we have measured the fluctuations of the translocation coordinate @xmath167 as a function of time for both the bdtp model and directly from md simulations .",
    "in the bdtp model , the _ trans _ side subchain is not included , and therefore we expect that the total amount of noise is smaller in the bdtp model than in md .",
    "this is indeed the case , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_s_hist_bdtp_md ] .",
    "initially , @xmath168 scales similarly for the bdtp and md , but as the chain translocates and the length of the chain on the _ trans _ side increases , the fluctuations in the md simulation start to increase faster .",
    "the effect of the missing _",
    "trans _ side fluctuations can be also seen in the distribution of the translocation times . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_s_hist_bdtp_md ] , the standard deviation of the translocation times is roughly two times larger in the md simulations , as compared to the bdtp solutions .",
    "including additional noise from the translocated part of the chain may bring both the scaling of @xmath168 and the distribution of translocation times closer to the md results .",
    "however , a proper implementation of the _ trans _ side fluctuations would also require considering the out - of equilibrium effects of monomer crowding in front of the _ trans _ side pore entrance .",
    "this is a subject of future study and is not within the scope of the present work .",
    "lastly , we wish to discuss the initial stages of the translocation process .",
    "several authors have suggested that in the early stages of translocation , an initial tension blob should be formed at the pore entrance before the tension propagation process can begin  @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts that the time it takes for the initial blob to form , @xmath169 , decreases with increasing force , as the size of the blob gets smaller . in md simulations",
    ", this process should be visible as an initial period of time during which the translocation coordinate @xmath68 changes only slightly ( say , from 1 to 2 ) .",
    "we have investigated the prediction by running extensive md simulations and looking at the time evolution of @xmath68 and the dependence of the corresponding scaling exponent @xmath149 on the driving force .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_md_boundary ] as open symbols .",
    "at least for @xmath170 , the initial time evolution of @xmath68 seems to be insensitive to the driving force .",
    "hence , we find no indications of the blob initiation process .",
    "in addition , we find that the scaling exponent @xmath149 , as measured using values in the range @xmath171 , is also quite insensitive to the driving force for @xmath172 , and decreases with decreasing force for @xmath173 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the bdtp model s result that for low forces the exponent @xmath1 decreases with _ increasing _ force and the approximate relation @xmath174 .",
    "however , the result is contrasted by the recent study by dubbeldam et al .",
    "@xcite where it is found that @xmath149 decreases with _ increasing _ force , and where the blob initiation process is observed to increase the time that the system remains close to the initial value of @xmath175 .    in an attempt to resolve the contradiction",
    ", we have repeated the md simulations with an additional reflecting boundary condition ( rbc ) that prevents the escape of the first monomer to the _ cis _ side .",
    "a similar boundary condition was also used in the md simulations of ref .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_md_boundary ] as solid symbols . in this case , the results agree with ref .",
    "@xcite , showing a decrease of @xmath149 with increasing force , and correspondingly a decrease in the time that the system remains close to @xmath175 .",
    "the behavior of the translocation process in these two cases ( with or without the rbc ) is therefore qualitatively different , especially at low driving forces .",
    "we argue that the difference is due to a fundamental change in the system s free energy , introduced by imposing the reflective boundary condition . for the canonical translocation problem , where the chain is allowed to escape to the _ cis _ side , the free energy has a maximum but no minimum  @xcite . preventing the escape to the _ cis _ side",
    "creates a local minimum in the free energy where the system can oscillate , changing the problem into a thermally activated escape process , similar to the famous kramers problem  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the initial period of slow growth of @xmath68 is not related to the blob initiation , but to the thermal motion of the chain in the free - energy well near @xmath175 , which precedes the eventual escape across the free - energy barrier to the _ trans _ side .",
    "in fact , according to our md simulations with the rbc , the time that is spent in evolving from @xmath176 to , say , @xmath177 , increases roughly exponentially with decreasing force .",
    "this is a clear indication of a thermally activated barrier crossing process .",
    "in addition , the influence of the rbc disappears for large driving forces where the activation barrier becomes negligible , also in support of our argument .",
    "finally , we should acknowledge that while our md simulations show no signs of the blob initiation process , it is possible that the process becomes practically observable only for significantly smaller driving forces ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "unfortunately , that regime may be out of reach of current md simulations .",
    "in this work , we have employed theoretical methods and langevin dynamics simulations to examine the finite chain length effects and the resulting non - universalities in driven polymer translocation .",
    "we show that the driven translocation problem can be accurately described by the non - equilibrium tension propagation mechanism proposed by sakaue  @xcite .",
    "however , finite chain length effects prevail for extremely long chains .",
    "thus , for chain lengths relevant for experiments or numerical simulations , these effects need to be taken into account .",
    "especially , the frictional interaction between the pore and the polymer has to be included in the theory , if quantitative accuracy is required .",
    "this result underlines the significance of understanding the interactions between the polymer and the pore also from the point of view of fundamental physics , and is especially important for interpretation of experimental data .",
    "in addition , we discuss the potential limitations of the present tension propagation theory .",
    "although very accurate in the typical experimental and simulation regimes , the absence of the _ trans _ side subchain from the theory may result in less - than - accurate predictions in the extremely strong force regime ( @xmath179 ) and in the extremely low force regime ( @xmath180 ) . in the first case , the non - equilibrium crowding of monomers on the _ trans _ side could increase the effective friction . in the other extreme , the fluctuations from the _ trans _ side chain , which are neglected in the model , may become important .",
    "in addition , the tension propagation theory of refs .",
    "@xcite is inherently a deterministic theory .",
    "however , in the low - force regime the tension propagation process becomes increasingly stochastic , instead of deterministic .",
    "exploring the implications of diffusive tension propagation is not within the scope of the present work , but is a subject of future study .",

    "@xmath189 is the coordinate in the direction perpendicular to the wall , with @xmath190 signifying the _ cis _ side and @xmath191 the _ trans _ side .",
    "the neighborhood of the pore is constructed of immobile lennard - jones beads of size @xmath113 .",
    "all monomer - pore particle pairs have the same short - range repulsive lj - interaction as described above .",
    "we have verified that using the simple external potential @xmath192 for the wall gives the same results ( within statistical error ) as using a wall made of monomers in fixed lattice sites , at least as long as the interaction between the wall and the polymer is purely repulsive . on the other hand , the geometry of the pore itself may have significant effect on the results , as is discussed in the main text .    similarly to most of the molecular dynamics simulations in the literature  @xcite , we take the surrounding solvent into account through frictional and random forces .",
