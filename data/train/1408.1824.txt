    "virtual cathode oscillators ( vircators ) demonstrate significant advantages over other microwave sources : ability to operate without a guiding magnetic field , rather short operation region , enhanced tunability of the operation frequency , high output power , and relative simplicity of resonator design . however , low efficiency and instability of the generation frequency are typical disadvantages of most vircators",
    ".    the efficiency of vircators can be increased , particularly , by setting resonant conditions for the beam energy  to  hpm ( high power microwave ) conversion .",
    "the authors of @xcite have described the design of an axial vircator capable of high power efficiency ( 67@xmath0 ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the electron beam produced in a 700 kv and @xmath1 24 ka diode and interacting with a multicavity resonator at a frequency of about 4 ghz provided the average output power of about 1 gw .        the aim of the present work is to develop such geometry of a multicavity resonator for an axial vircator that could provide hpm generation at a frequency from 3 to 4 ghz with the efficiency higher than 5@xmath0 at a cathode voltage less than that used by the authors of @xcite .",
    "various configurations of vircators were simulated with the self - developed code @xcite , which we called inpic ( institute for nuclear problems particle in cell code ) . like any other pic code",
    ", inpic combines finite - difference formulation of maxwell s equations and the finite - size particle method . as is known @xcite , use of discrete ( or finite - difference )",
    "methods for the solution of maxwell s equations implies regular corrections and smoothing ( numerical filtering ) of numerical solutions for fields , charge and current densities .",
    "the techniques and methods used for these correction procedures involve a number of parameters which can be chosen from comparison with other simulation or experimental results rather than from theoretical consideration .",
    "to gain both validation and experience in fixing these parameters we will extensively use here simulation results obtained using a free xoopic code .",
    "the main difference between simulations with inpic and xoopic @xcite lies in the simulation procedures for the electron injection from the cathode and in the processes occuring in the cathode - anode zone .    with inpic",
    ", the charge is injected in a plane that is one quarter cell width away from the emitting surface of the cathode .",
    "the value of the injected charge is governed by the gauss theorem for cells adjacent to the surface and by the electric field vanishing on the emitting surface .",
    "in other words , this means that the value of the electron - beam current is not an initially preset parameter , but is calculated from the physical laws at each time step .",
    "simulations performed with xoopic do not consider the processes in the cathode - anode gap : the electron beam having a fixed electron current and energy is injected directly into the first resonator cavity .",
    "the electrons reflected from the virtual cathode are left out of the consideration if they transmit the injection plane ( anode mesh ) .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the second section reconstructs the dimensions of the system @xcite from the graphs given therein for simulated and experimental radiation spectra and power at a specified diode voltage and current .",
    "the third section describes the procedure used to select the geometry of a three - cavity resonator for generating radiation in the frequency range from 3 to 4 ghz at the electron beam energies from 300 to 450 kev ( xoopic ) and diode voltage of 450 kv(inpic ) and gives several variants of the selected geometries .",
    "we simulate the radiation spectrum and output power of the axial vircator using both inpic and xoopic for the suggested geometries of three - cavity resonators and it is shown that the power efficiency can be as large as about 5@xmath0 .",
    "fig.1 shows the schematic geometry of the three - cavity resonator under study .",
    "the authors of @xcite specify only some dimensions of the structure : the anode diameter equal to the diameter of the first section @xmath2 mm ; the cathode diameter ",
    "64 mm ; the dimensions of the cathode - anode gap  14 mm at which the maximum efficiency was obtained , and the geometric transparency of the anode mesh  70 @xmath0 ; they also give the frequencies of the axial vircator that correspond to different values of the cathode voltage : 4.1 ghz at 630 kv and 3.98 ghz at 700 kv , respectively .",
    "all other dimensions in fig.1 were reconstructed using the poisson superfish code . in simulating with poisson superfish , we choose all dimensions so as to provide the coincidence between the calculated resonant frequencies and those given in @xcite ( 4.04 and 4.16 ghz ) . thus obtained data are listed in table 1 .",
    "the total length of the resonator appears to be 261 mm . according to the simulation results reported in @xcite ,",
    "the average power of 1 gw was achieved at diode voltage and current of 630 kv and 24 ka , respectively , while at diode voltage of 700 kv , the average power was 1.8 gw with the instantaneous power peaks greater than 4 gw .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for resonator @xmath32 , stable generation with instantaneous peak power of about 800 mw at a frequency of 3.8 ghz was obtained for a solid cathode of radius @xmath4=35.5 mm and a cathode - anode gap of 14 mm .",
    "the output power and radiation spectrum at cathode voltage of 450 kv are given in fig .",
    "12 . replacing the solid cathode by a ring - type one with the inner and outer radii of @xmath5=13.5 mm and @xmath6=35.5 mm , respectively , and choosing the cathode - anode gap equal to 13 mm results in about a 20@xmath0 increase in the instantaneous peak power at the same frequency .",
    "the radiation power and spectrum obtained at cathode voltage of 450 kv are given in fig .",
    "the increase in the output power observed when using a ring - type cathode can possibly be explained by the obvious difference in the phase portraits of the beam ( see fig .",
    "14 ) : the number of high - energy ( accelerated by the field ) particles in the three - cavity resonator is greater than that obtained for a solid cathode .    the output power and the radiation spectrum simulated with inpic for the axial vircator with resonator @xmath33 , ring - type cathode ( @xmath5=9.5 mm and @xmath6=35.5 mm ) , and the cathode - anode gap of 13 mm at cathode voltage of 450 kv are shown in fig . 15 .",
    "the basis for selection of the ring - type cathode rests on the analysis of the phase portraits of the beam for solid and ring - type cathodes with different values of the inner diameter @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "analyzing fig .",
    "16 , one can conclude that conversion of the beam energy to hpm is most efficient in the axial vircator with resonator @xmath33 and a cathode with inner and outer radii @xmath5=9.5 mm and @xmath6=35.5 mm , respectively ( fig .",
    "16b ) . in this case ,",
    "most of the particles oscillate near the virtual cathode , and their longitudinal momenta @xmath7 are close to or slightly less than zero ; a fraction of high - energy particles is quite effectively `` cut off '' by the first annulus , though some of them still enter into the second cavity ( section ) .",
    "it is seen from the phase portrait in fig.16a for the axial vircator with a solid cathode that in the first cavity , the longitudinal momenta @xmath7 of a large number of particles are close to unity , but not less than zero as in the axial vircator with cathode of @xmath5= 9.5 mm ( fig .",
    "16b ) , which indicates a smaller efficiency of the virtual cathode . one can also see that the particle density near the virtual cathode for a @xmath5=13.5 mm ( fig .",
    "16c ) cathode is rather small , and the output power is not high in spite of the fact that the first and second annuli effectively cut off high - energy particles ( this is because the cathode configuration is not optimal ) .",
    "the above analysis implies that the effective operation of a three - cavity axial vircator depends strongly on both the resonator geometry , selected so as to effectively cut off the fraction of high - energy particles , and the cathode parameters .",
    "it is worth noting that the analysis given here has been made neglecting many aspects that could cause a noticeable decrease in the generation efficiency , and shortening of the pulse length .",
    "particularly , the cathode plasma expansion @xcite and the influence of the energy ( velocity ) spread of the beam electrons , which necessarily exists in the system , leads to an appreciable lowering of efficiency penalty at practically unchanged radiation spectrum @xcite for xoopic simulations ( in inpic , this spread is inherently included ) .",
    "it should also be taken into account in planning the experiments that xoopic simulation is performed at constant beam energy and current , set as parameters that could cause radiation power overestimation @xcite , while inpic simulation makes it possible to easily include the change in the cathode voltage , as well as to simulate the actual current .",
    "stable generation and high values of instantaneous peak power obtained through using the simulation procedures described in this paper is a good reason for conducting experimental investigation of the suggested three - cavity resonators .",
