    "during the last few years , the data collected from the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite has allowed to obtain a more precise measurement of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "this is expected to further improve in the near future with the map experiment  @xcite and the planck satellite  @xcite . at the present time , the measurement of the baryon - to - entropy ratio is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the entropy density and @xmath4 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom .    it is well known that in order to obtain an asymmetry starting from a symmetric state with a vanishing baryon number , three requirements must be satisfied : baryon number violation , @xmath5 and @xmath0 violation , and departure from thermal and kinetic equilibrium  @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions , the main source of @xmath0 violation comes from the phase @xmath6 in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix . although this phase is able to account for the experimentally observed @xmath0 violation in the neutral @xmath7-mesons and , as recently observed , in the @xmath8 system , it has been shown that it is not possible to generate sufficient bau through @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the phase transition is too weak in the sm and the universe is approximately in equilibrium @xcite ( for reviews on electroweak baryogenesis , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm , it has been pointed out that the above problems can be in principle overcome @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the presence of light stops the electroweak phase transition can be strong enough for baryogenesis to take place  @xcite .",
    "moreover , susy models contain new @xmath0-violating sources beyond @xmath6 , namely the higgs bilinear term , @xmath1 , and the soft breaking terms ( gaugino and squark soft masses , bilinear and trilinear couplings ) .",
    "these can be classified as flavor - blind or flavor - dependent .",
    "the first category includes the phases of the @xmath1- and @xmath9-parameters , of the gaugino masses and the overall phase of the trilinear couplings @xmath10 .",
    "two of these phases can be eliminated by @xmath11 and @xmath12 transformations .",
    "the second category contains the phases of @xmath10 ( after the overall phase is factored out ) , as well as the ones appearing in the off - diagonal elements of the soft squark masses .",
    "the low energy implications of these flavor - dependent phases on @xmath7 and @xmath9 meson @xmath0-violating observables , as well as in rare decays , have been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the question that naturally arises is whether the new susy phases could significantly enhance the @xmath0-violating sources , so that supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis could account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done concerning the implications of the new flavor - independent @xmath0-violating phases on generating an acceptable value of the baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , if the relative phase @xmath13 between the gaugino soft mass and the @xmath1 term is not too small , @xmath14 , a considerable bau can be generated through the scattering of the charginos with the bubble wall .",
    "however , the non - observation of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron , neutron and mercury atom  @xcite imposes severe constraints on the flavor - diagonal phases  @xcite , forcing them to be small . since in this limit",
    "the theory does not acquire any new symmetry , one has to deal with a naturalness problem , and this is precisely the so - called susy @xmath0 problem .    in particular , the edm s bound the phase @xmath13 to be @xmath15 , if the susy particle masses are not too heavy ( @xmath16  tev ) .",
    "it has recently been claimed that new contributions to the edm of the electron could eventually rule out the electroweak baryogenesis scenario based on flavor - independent @xmath0-violating phases  @xcite . a possible way to generate enough bau while evading these constraints",
    "is to work in the heavy squark limit ( @xmath17 )  @xcite .",
    "however , if we assume that susy @xmath0 violation has a flavor character such as in the sm  @xcite , one is led to a scenario where all flavor conserving parameters as the @xmath1-term and gaugino masses are real . in this framework , the dominant sources of @xmath0 violation that are relevant to electroweak baryogenesis are in general associated with the lightest of the right - handed up - squarks  @xcite . in the usual mssm scenario with complex @xmath1 and gaugino masses , this contribution would be always subdominant , and could even be neglected when compared to that of the charginos and neutralinos  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of the flavor - dependent @xmath0-violating phases on the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "we show that in generic susy models with non - universal soft susy breaking terms , and in particular with non - universal @xmath18-terms , the squark contributions to the bau are far from being negligible .",
    "although in this framework the @xmath1-term is real , flavor mixing might lead to a potentially large baryon asymmetry . as an example",
    ", we analyze the baryon asymmetry in supersymmetric models with hermitian flavor structures , a type of model that also provides an elegant solution for the edm s suppression  @xcite .",
    "obtaining sufficiently accurate transport equations for particles propagating in the presence of a @xmath0-violating bubble wall at the electroweak phase transition is crucial for the computation of the baryon asymmetry generated in the context of electroweak baryogenesis . in spite of the general consensus on the existence and nature of the @xmath0-violating sources responsible for the baryon production ,",
    "there is still a controversy in the literature in what concerns the strength and form of these sources as well as the transport equations to be used in the calculations  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the results obtained in the mssm framework for the chargino and squark sources by making use of the continuity equations and the relaxation time approximation  @xcite are different from those based on wkb - methods  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the dominant contribution to the chargino source , typically found within the mssm and which is of the form @xmath19 ( @xmath20 are the expectation values of the two higgs doublets ) @xcite , is absent , thus leading to a suppressed baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent work  @xcite it is argued that such a suppression is in fact an artifact of the approximation used by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite in order to compute the @xmath0-violating currents . in view of the above discussion",
    ", we adopt in the present work the approach of refs .",

    "we compute the baryon asymmetry induced by these @xmath0-violating sources .",
    "an analytical approximate expression for the asymmetry is also presented . in section  [ textures ]",
    "we obtain model independent bounds for the up - squark left - right mass insertions by requiring the baryon - to - entropy ratio to lie in the experimental range .",
    "we also consider some specific susy models with minimal and non - minimal flavor structure and discuss whether or not they can account for the required bau .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "finally , we present our concluding remarks in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "before computing the @xmath0-violating sources for the baryon asymmetry , we shall briefly recall some characteristics of non - equilibrium quantum field theory @xcite . during a first - order phase transition ,",
    "the thermodynamical system is far from equilibrium . in order to keep an explicit time dependence",
    ", one should use the real - time finite temperature quantum field theory . the most used and powerful formalism to describe such a system is the so - called closed time path formalism ( ctp ) , which is a generalization of the time contour integration to a closed time path .",
    "more precisely , the time integration is deformed to run from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and back to @xmath21 .",
    "the main effect of this closed time path is to double the field variables so that for each field we have four different real - time propagators on the contour . in the case of a boson field @xmath23 , we can write the corresponding green functions in terms of the @xmath24 matrices @xcite @xmath25{cc } g_{\\phi}^{t } & \\;\\;g_{\\phi}^{<}\\\\ g_{\\phi}^ { > } & - g_{\\phi}^{\\overline{t } } \\end{array } \\right)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 @xmath27 in what follows the subscript @xmath23 will be omitted to simplify our notation .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",

    "we have shown that if we impose on these terms the condition to have a strong first - order phase transition induced by a light right - handed squark , the baryon asymmetry of the universe produced at the electroweak scale is typically too small , thus disfavoring this scenario .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the problem of the strength of the first - order electroweak phase transition is solved through another mechanism as it can happen in extensions of the mssm with additional higgs scalars , it is possible to have textures for the up- and down - quark yukawa coupling matrices in order to maximize the @xmath0-violating source .",

    "supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis is an attractive mechanism to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",

    "there are still a few questions to be answered and controversial issues to be clarified .",
    "for instance , the precise details of the electroweak phase transition are still unknown and there is at present a debate regarding the structure of the @xmath0-violating currents that are relevant to baryogenesis .",
