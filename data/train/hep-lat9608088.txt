    "the extraction of ckm matrix elements from experimental data requires the calculation of qcd matrix elements of operators involving the bottom quark  @xcite . for a number of years",
    "the milc collaboration has been doing a systematic study of the @xmath0 decay constant  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of simulating the bottom quark , with its mass larger than current feasible inverse lattice spacings , was overcome by interpolating between the results of simulations using wilson quarks with masses around the charm mass and those from static simulations ( infinite mass ) .",
    "unfortunately , for some of the simulations the @xmath3 results were not useable .",
    "these results came as a by - product of the hopping parameter expansion of the heavy quark , and for technical reasons had significant contamination by higher momentum intermediate states when the physical volume was large  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that the poor signal to noise ratio of the static simulations makes it important to use an efficient smearing method . to provide @xmath3 results on all lattices , and to reduce the errors even in the cases where the results were previously available",
    ", we have started a set of static - light simulations using a variational smearing method .",
    "the computational cost of our current implementation of the fft on parallel machines , prohibited the use of a more sophisticated smearing technique such as most  @xcite , so we use the following basis of smearing functions : @xmath4 the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 were obtained from uncorrelated fits to the kentucky group s measured wave functions of static - light mesons ( at @xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters were scaled to the appropriate value for a given @xmath10 , using the estimates of the lattice spacing .",
    "because of uncertainties in the lattice spacing , and to have the flexibility to choose different smearing functions for each kappa value , two additional sets of the parameters were chosen .",
    "thus a variational smearing matrix of order ten ( including the local operator ) is used in the simulations .",
    "the static quark is smeared _ relative _ to the light quark using standard fft methods .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     chirally extrapolating the @xmath11 results to @xmath12 and converting the results to the one loop rg invariant @xmath13 parameter , we obtain the preliminary value of @xmath14 ( statistical error only ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the values obtained from quenched simulations using wilson fermions  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "to calculate the form factors of the semi - leptonic decays of the @xmath6 meson , we want to follow a strategy similar to the one used in the @xmath0 simulations , except that we will combine the results of heavy quark effective field theory ( hqet ) with the analogous propagating quark calculations , to allow the final results to be interpolated to the @xmath6 meson mass .    as a `` warm up exercise ''",
    "we studied the two point function of a hqet - light meson .",
    "this exercise allows us to investigate the smearing of the quarks in the @xmath6 meson and to study the nonperturbative renormalization of the velocity ( a peculiarity of lattice hqet )  both of which are important prerequisites to the calculation of form factors .",
    "we have implemented the hqet propagator equation introduced by mandula and ogilvie @xcite .",
    "the two - point function for an hqet - light meson at finite residual momentum @xmath15 and bare velocity @xmath16 is @xmath17 when there is no excited state contamination , the correlator has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the smeared and local matrix elements .",
    "the dispersion relation for an hqet - light meson is @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is equal to the energy obtained in the static simulation . here",
    "@xmath23 is the renormalized velocity .    as a pilot study we generated 20 correlators at @xmath24 with a light",
    "quark kappa value of 0.160 .",
    "so far , a single exponential source , as in the static simulations , was used .",
    "[ fig : hqet_ps ] shows the effective mass plots for a hqet - light meson at zero residual momentum with bare velocities only in the @xmath25 direction of 0.1 , 0.5 , and 0.8 ; the static effective mass plot is also included ( equivalent to zero velocity ) .",
    "the single exponential produces almost usable plateaus for all three velocities  the plateaus should improve when we use variational smearing . the signal to noise ratio does not decrease rapidly with increasing velocity .",
    "the renormalization of the velocity is caused by the breaking of the lorentz symmetry by the lattice .",
    "this renormalization is required in the calculation of form factors such as the isgur - wise function  @xcite . our preferred way to extract the renormalization is to use the dispersion relation in eq  ( [ eq : hqetdisp ] ) with the energy taken from simulations .",
    "this approach seems to us  @xcite  @xcite to be simpler than the one used by mandula and ogilvie  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the velocity renormalization can be obtained from the data in fig .  [",
    "fig : hqet_ps ] , using naive fits to the effective masses and using eq  ( [ eq : hqetdisp ] ) with zero residual momentum . for the bare velocity of 0.5 ( 0.8 ) in the @xmath25 direction , the renormalized velocity was approximately eighty ( sixty five ) percent of the bare velocity . with higher statistics and better smearing a more sophisticated analysis will be done .",
    "the perturbative calculation of mandula and ogilvie  @xcite also gave a renormalized velocity smaller than the bare velocity .",
    "this work is supported in part by the u.s .",
    "department of energy and the nsf we would like to thank terry draper for discussions on hqet and @xmath2 , and joe christensen for providing us with the coefficients for the @xmath2 parameter calculation .",
