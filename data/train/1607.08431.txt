    "nanocavity devices , featuring arrays of nanopits etched in a slit , have been investigated for their utility in molecular self - assembly @xcite , to control single polymer mobility @xcite and diffusion @xcite , and as a probe of polymer confinement physics @xcite .    recently @xcite we showed that correlations in the fluctuations of contour in a molecule straddling two cavities can be understood in terms of harmonic modes arising from the confining potential sculpted by the nanofluidic geometry . making an analogy between statistical and quantum mechanics , the harmonic modes that give rise to local correlations",
    "correspond to bound states , whereas the propagating modes along the whole molecule correspond to scattering states .",
    "continuing with the harmonic oscillator analogy , extending the number of coupled oscillators to the large-@xmath0 limit gives rise to collective phenomena such as phonons .",
    "we investigate phenomena analogous to phonons in our overdamped nanofluidic system by increasing the number of cavities occupied by the dna .",
    "[ fig : f1 ]    in this study genomic - length dna molecules are confined to linear arrays of nanofluidic cavities embedded in a nanofluidic slit ( see fig .",
    "the device is constructed so that one molecule straddles and fills many cavities .",
    "while the cavities are less confining than the surrounding slit , so it is entropically favourable for contour to accumulate in the cavities , excluded - volume interactions place an upper limit on the amount of contour that can be partitioned into a given cavity : a sufficiently long molecule can therefore fill multiple cavities . in addition",
    ", self - exclusion confers a free energy cost to accumulating too much contour in a given cavity , leading to a self - exclusion driven relaxation process whereby contour is transferred to a neighbouring cavity via the connecting linker strand .",
    "this cavity - to - cavity coupling leads to thermal excitations of molecular contour manifesting themselves as `` waves '' of excess fluorescent intensity propagating along the molecule , which can be seen in a video in the supplemental material ( http://web.mit.edu/aklotz/www/si1.gif ) .",
    "this system provides a controlled manner to examine the emergence of collective phenomena , the observed density waves , from microscopic behaviour , the transfer of molecular contour between the cavities . in these experiments , the network of nanofluidic entropic traps acts as a `` renormalizer '' to reduce the number of interacting components in the system to a small integer , reducing the infinite set of relaxation modes associated with rouse - zimm polymer dynamics into a finite set determined by the number of filled cavities .    from an application point of view",
    ", emerging biotechnologies utilizing nanofluidic confinement to control or constrain dna can benefit from a knowledge of the global behaviour of dna contour redistribution .",
    "for example , when imaging a single region of a molecule , it is necessary to know for how long the image contains the same genetic information , to optimize the data acquisition parameters . such knowledge may guide the design of zero - mode - waveguide sequencing devices @xcite or entropic sieves @xcite .",
    "nanoslit molecular stretching devices are limited in observation time by the global transfer of contour across a slit between reservoirs @xcite , and this time can be constrained using a knowledge of the internal contour transfer modes .",
    "future nanopore devices @xcite may rely on translocating dna through multiple pores in serial to improve signal - to - noise , in which case it is necessary to understand how contour is transferred between the cavities on either side of a pore .",
    "the experimental system is a nanofluidic lab - on - a - chip device featuring a slit with a height on the order of 100 nm that is embedded with a lattice of square cavities etched to twice the depth of the slit ( see fig .",
    "the devices were fabricated through standard nanolithography and etching techniques ( see @xcite ) .",
    "fluid is loaded into the nanofeatures through sandblasted holes that are interfaced to the nanoslit by microchannel arms ( 50@xmath1 m wide , 1@xmath1 m deep ) , positioned symmetrically on either side of the nanoslit .",
    "the experiments were conducted with t4 dna ( 166kbp ) stained with yoyo-1 fluorescent dye at 10:1 base - pair : dye ratio .",
    "in addition , we used the 43 kbp charomid dna ( wako ) , at the same dye loading , as an example of a molecule with circular topology .",
    "the dna is loaded in a 10 mm tris buffer with 2% beta - mercaptoethanol to suppress photobleaching and photo nicking .",
    "once loaded into the reservoirs , pneumatic pressure is used to circulate dna through the microchannel arms and then drive dna from the microchannel into the nanoslit .",
    "once the molecules enter a region of the nanoslit containing nanocavity arrays , contour will be partitioned into adjacent cavities ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , forming self - assembled nanocavity conformations .",
    "large dna molecules such as t4 are liable to fragment due to shear or photo nicking , which we use to our advantage to obtain a polydispersity of experimental molecule lengths .",
    "initial conformations are typically aligned with the flow axis of the slit .",
    "while thermally excited cavity - to - cavity jumps do take place , leading to occupancy transitions and diffusion of the polymer center of mass , this diffusion takes place over much longer time - scales than investigated here .",
    "we explicitly exclude molecules that undergo occupancy transitions during the acquisition , and begin recording after the molecules have finished relaxing from an initially stretched state .",

    "individual molecules are recorded for 5000 frames with a 30ms exposure time ( 150 seconds total ) , using a 100x oil immersion objective , a metal - halide illumination source ( xcite ) and an em - ccd ( andor ixon ) .",
    "molecules occupying between 5 and 15 cavities were studied , while circular molecules occupied four cavities .",
    "qualitatively , we observe that `` waves '' of excess contour propagate along the molecules as they stably straddle multiple cavities , with the propagating excitations lasting several seconds . the dynamics can be observed most conveniently in a  kymograph \" representation , showing intensity along the molecule axis versus time .",
    "a kymograph of a typical molecule is shown in fig .  1 , as well as a display of the integrated cavity intensities over time ( each coloured square represents one cavity at one frame )",
    ". excitations , corresponding to regions of local overdensity , extend diagonally through the kymograph as the excitation propagates .",
    "these excitations appear to emerge randomly , typically near the end of the molecule and last for several seconds .",
    "these dynamics can also be observed in video form ( see supplemental material , http://web.mit.edu/aklotz/www/si1.gif ) .",
    "we argue that these dna waves arise due to thermal excitations that create a local contour over - density that then flows from one cavity to the next .      to study quantitatively the intensity fluctuation dynamics we examine intensity cross - correlation functions between different cavities .",
    "using a custom matlab program we determine the cavity center - positions from the local maxima in the projected intensity of a given single molecule recording . the intensity is then integrated in a @xmath2 box around the cavity center position , yielding a time - series of the intensity for each cavity over the 5000 acquired frames .",
    "each @xmath0-cavity molecule yields an @xmath3 matrix intensity series .",
    "there are @xmath0 distinct autocorrelation functions and @xmath4 unique cross - correlation functions .",

    "shows examples of cross - correlation functions between the cavity at one end of a molecule and the subsequent four cavities .",
    "qualitatively , the neighbour cross - correlation is negative at short time - lag , changes sign and increases to a maximum positive correlation before decaying and reaching the noise floor at very long time lags . at zero time lag",
    ", the correlation between two cavities is expected to be negative because if one cavity has an excess of dna , contour conservation dictates that the other cavity is likely to have a shortage of contour . because the excess of contour is transferred to other cavities over a finite time interval , at a later time the excess will have transferred from one cavity to the other , yielding a positive correlation in contour intensity at some small finite time . over longer periods",
    "the correlations are expected to decay to zero .",
    "this describes the behaviour observed in fig .  2 : negative correlations at zero time that rise to some positive maximum a short time later before decaying to zero .",
    "the time lag before the positive peak generally increases as the cavities become farther apart .",
    "[ fig : sec ]      measuring the autocorrelation times of the individual cavity intensities across the molecules shows that the relaxation time - scale is greater for cavities at the end of the molecule compared to cavities in the interior ( see fig .",
    "the autocorrelation time was defined as the best - fit decay time of an exponential curve fit to the second - through - eleventh points of an autocorrelation function ( the intercept of the fit yields the variance ) . to directly compare different molecules , each cavity index was normalized such that the cavities on either end had an index of @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and the central cavity was zero ( for example",
    ", in a five - cavity molecule , the two ends would have an index of @xmath7 and @xmath5 , the middle cavity would have an index of zero , and the second and fourth cavity would have an index of @xmath80.5 ) . by comparing the autocorrelation times of each cavity as a function of the normalized index , over an aggregate of many molecules ,",
    "a trend emerges : the autocorrelation time of the end cavities is twice that of the cavities in the interior .",
    "averaged correlation times were equivalent to their symmetric partners on the other side of the molecule .",
    "we also measured the single - pit autocorrelation times of circular charomid dna in square rings of four cavities . because there are no ends to break the symmetry , the averaged autocorrelation time is independent of cavity index .",
    "the `` internal average '' of these autocorrelation times , the mean of the autocorrelation times of the non - end pit intensities , serves as a characteristic timescale of a given molecule that can be used to normalize the dynamics , compare measurements on different molecules and compare with theory .",
    "[ fig : autocorrelationtime ]",
    "to verify that the observed experimental phenomena were due to the underlying fluctuations in the dna and not our experimental apparatus , langevin dynamics simulations were used to model the system , similar to the algorithms used to understand two - pit relaxation @xcite . using a bead - spring coarse - grained system @xcite ,",
    "monomers were connected together in a linear fashion via the finitely extensive nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xcite and a weeks - chandler - anderson excluded volume @xcite was used to define a monomer size .",
    "chains with lengths of 150 to 275 monomers were simulated .",
    "bending rigidity was imposed as a three - bead harmonic potential with a spring constant chosen to yield a 5:1 persistence length to bead width ratio .",
    "the slits were defined between smooth walls separated by two monomer widths , with cavities defined as recesses in one of the walls .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are chosen not necessarily to replicate experimental conditions , but to ensure long - time occupation in a given large - n configuration .",
    "the chains were initialized spanning the pit array and allowed to relax into an occupancy state , and simulated for at least 100,000 bead - diffusion time - steps .",
    "the first 10,000 time - steps are discarded to eliminate initial - condition artifacts .",
    "the number of beads in each pit over time is analyzed the same way as the experimental intensity time series , producing analogous correlation functions .",
    "the same qualitative features in the correlation functions are seen between the experimental data and the simulations ( fig .",
    "to develop a theoretical understanding of these fluctuations , we draw upon the tools of stochastic physics . we consider a molecule of contour length @xmath9 straddling @xmath0 cavities .",
    "the contour length will be partitioned between the @xmath0 filled cavities and linker strands connecting the cavities . in our study of a two - cavity system @xcite , we have found that the system s long - time behaviour is dominated by an ` asymmetric ' exchange mode whereby contour is transferred directly between the cavities , keeping the linker tension constant . while contour can be exchanged between the cavities and the linkers via a symmetric exchange mode involving a net transfer of contour from the cavities into the slit , due to the high stiffness of the linker ,",
    "the symmetric exchange mode is suppressed relative to the asymmetric mode and occurs at much faster time - scales . for the purposes of modelling the long time behaviour of an array of coupled cavities",
    ", we therefore assume that contour is transferred directly between nearest neighbour cavities with the contour in the linkers held fixed .",
    "furthermore , we argue that the time - scale of contour transfer @xmath10 should be given by the relaxation time of the asymmetric transfer mode in @xcite implying @xmath11 , is the buffer viscosity , kt is the thermal energy , d is the depth of the cavity , w is the effective molecular width , a is the cavity width , and @xmath12 is the lattice spacing ] typically 0.5 to 1 second .",
    "this physical picture leads directly to a lattice diffusion model @xcite consisting of an aggregate of diffusing particles hopping stochastically between array sites .",
    "the frequency of hops from one site to the next depends on the number of hoppers in the initial site .",
    "this process can be written in the master equation formalism , describing the probability of finding a given particle at a given site at a given time . because the probability density is directly correlated with the contour length per cavity ,",
    "we can write a master equation in terms of the contour in the i@xmath13 pit , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the rate of hopping from cavity @xmath16 to cavity @xmath17 : @xmath18 in addition , for a linear array of cavities , the end - cavities ( cavity @xmath7 and @xmath0 ) satisfy : @xmath19 and @xmath20 detailed balance and the spatial equivalence of the lattice sites yield @xmath21 .",

    "equal_. while this fact may seem surprising , given that it implies the covariance of cavities far apart are equal , realize that the covariance refers to the instantaneous correlation ( correlation at zero lag time ) .",
    "this instantaneous correlation can not depend on cavity separation as our model does not include interactions that depend on cavity separation .",
    "the cross - cavity correlation at zero lag must solely reflect contour conservation , e.g. the fact that if cavity @xmath16 has excess contour , the other cavities will have less , and on average  because the cavities are physically equivalent  we would expect the net loss of contour to be spread evenly across the cavities , and indeed this is observed experimentally . naturally , at lag times greater than zero , physical proximity of the cavities does effect the cavity correlation ( with the overall details determined by the solution of eq .",

    "<S> we use a nanofluidic system to investigate the emergence of thermally driven collective phenomena along a single polymer chain . in our approach , </S>",
    "<S> a single dna molecule is confined in a nanofluidic slit etched with arrays of embedded nanocavities ; the cavity lattice is designed so that a single chain occupies multiple cavities . </S>",
    "<S> fluorescent video - microscopy data shows that waves of excess fluorescence propagate across the cavity - straddling molecule , corresponding to propagating fluctuations of contour overdensity in the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> the waves are quantified by examining the correlation in intensity fluctuations between neighbouring cavities . </S>",
    "<S> correlations grow from an anti - correlated minimum to a correlated maximum before decaying , corresponding to a transfer of contour between neighbouring cavities at a fixed transfer time - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the observed dynamics can be modelled using langevin dynamics simulations and a minimal lattice model of coupled diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> this study shows how confinement - based sculpting of the polymer equilibrium configuration , by renormalizing the physical system into a series of discrete cavity states , can lead to new types of dynamic collective phenomena . </S>"
