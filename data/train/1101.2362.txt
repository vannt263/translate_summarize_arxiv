    "in site selections for ground - based optical and ir astronomy , some of the most important parameters are the night - sky brightness , seeing , atmospheric transparency , clear nights and humidity .",
    "the number of clear nights provides the usable observing time .",
    "the sky background , seeing and atmospheric transparency have effect on the observation quality and depth .",
    "humidity affects the telescope and infrared transparency .",
    "the antarctic plateau offers some attractive advantages for ground - based astronomical observations .",
    "it is a unique continent where there is no contamination from the artifacts .",
    "the average altitude in antarctic plateau is more than 3000 m and the temperature is very low .",
    "site testing over the past decade has revealed that antarctica , relative to temperate latitude observatories , has lower infrared sky brightness , better free - atmosphere seeing , greater transparency , a lower turbulent boundary layer , and much lower water vapor content ( see , e.g. , reviews by ref .  ) .",
    "dome a is located at the highest peak of the continent .",
    "it has an elevation of about 4093 m. the year - round average temperature is about @xmath2 , dropping to as low as @xmath3 on occasion .",
    "such high altitude , low temperature and special geographical position make it be very dry , cold and windless .",
    "it might be reasonably predicted that dome a could be as good as or even a better astronomical site than dome c ( altitude of about 3250 m ) , with better seeing , higher transparency , and thinner surface layer .",
    "ref .   compared the sites dome a , b , c , f and ridge a and b in their cloud cover , free - atmosphere seeing , precipitable water vapor , temperature , and auroral emission , and concluded that , overall , dome a might be the best of the existing bases for astronomical observations .",
    "it is necessary that some facilities for site tests should be installed at dome a to assess the site quality . in 2008",
    "january , two chinese astronomers deployed several instruments at dome a including a small telescope array named cstar . with the observation data of 2008",
    ", we leaned the observing conditions such as the sky brightness , transparency and cloud covers .",
    "cstar was built by the nanjing institute of astronomical optics & technology ( niaot ) .",
    "it is composed of four co - aligned schmidt telescopes on a fixed mounting pointing toward the south celestial pole .",
    "each telescope has a different filter : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 , and open .",
    "the detectors are andor dv435 1k@xmath61k ccds with 13 @xmath7 m pixels , giving a plate scale of 15 arcsec pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the entrance pupil diameter is 145 mm and the effective aperture is 100 mm .",
    "total field of view of each telescope is about 4.5 squared degrees .",
    "the main goals of this telescope are to detect variable stars and measure sky brightness , transparency , and cloud cover .",
    "many telescope tests were performed at the xinglong station before the telescope array was transported to dome a @xcite .    due to defocus and other problems of control systems ,",
    "the data from telescopes of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and open bands are useless and only @xmath0 band data can be used to estimate those site parameters . in the whole winter ,",
    "cstar observed over 310,000 images with integration times of 20 s or 30 s , giving a total exposure time of about 1728 hr @xcite .",
    "data reductions for these ccd frames were also done by specifically designed processing pipelines .",
    "there are sorts of sources contributing to the sky background such as scattering from the sun and the moon , airglow , zodiacal light , aurorae , star light and interstellar dust scattering , extragalactic light , and artificial light contamination @xcite .",
    "artificial light pollution is essentially non - existent in antarctica .",
    "main contributions to the sky brightness come from the the atmospheric scattering of the light of the sun and the moon .",
    "zodiacal light might contribute up to half the intrinsic sky brightness if the sun and moon are down below the ground .",
    "for the pointing of cstar , the ecliptic longitude @xmath9 of the south celestial pole is about @xmath10 and latitude @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the zodiacal light have little effect on the sky background .",
    "on the other hand , we expect an increased contribution from the milky way , since the galactic latitude @xmath13 of the south celestial pole is @xmath14 , relatively close to the galactic plane . by the pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft observations of the total galactic plus extragalactic sky background in blue ( 395485 nm ) and red ( 590690 nm ) .",
    "we estimate the contribution of the diffused galactic light to the sky brightness to be about 0.06 mag in @xmath0 band .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the sky brightness variations throughout the whole winter of 2008 . at such far - southerly latitudes as dome a",
    ", the moon is always fairly full whenever it is above the horizon .",
    "therefore , we can see that there is a strong correlation between lunar elevation ( including the correction for parallax ) and sky brightness .",
    "the situation should be seriously considered during the future astronomical observations at dome a. figure [ fig2 ] shows the sky brightness distribution at dome a. the most probable sky brightness , across all lunar phases in the left panel of the figure , is about 20.1 mag arcsec@xmath1 and the median is 19.8 mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows the sky brightness distribution of images taken only on moonless and clear nights during 2008 june . in these images ,",
    "the sun and the moon elevation is below @xmath15 and there is no cloud .",
    "we find that the median sky brightness is 20.5 mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "this study has been supported by the chinese national natural science foundation through grants 10873016 , 10803007 , 10473012 , 10573020 , 10633020 , 10673012 , and 10603006 , and by the national basic research program of china ( 973 program ) , no .",
    "this research is also supported by the chinese panda international polar year project and the polar research institute of china ( pric ) . the support of the australian research council and the australian antarctic division for the plato observatory is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the authors thank all members of the 2008 and 2009 pric dome a expeditions for their heroic effort in reaching the site and for providing invaluable assistance to the expedition astronomers in setting up and servicing the plato observatory and its associated instrument suite .",
    "iridium communications were provided by the us national science foundation and the united states antarctic program .",
