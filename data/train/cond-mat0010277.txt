    "in recent years , optical investigations on semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted much attention both from the physical and technological points of view .",
    "such quasi zero dimensional systems display a discrete atomic  like density of states which is essentially different from that of higher dimensional systems , see e.g. textbooks@xcite and reviews@xcite . in order to realize the full potential of qds",
    ", it is very important to understand the basic physical properties of single qds whose fabrication and spatially resolved optical spectroscopy became possible in the last decade , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "optical properties of semiconductor microstructures are usually described in the approximation of a homogeneous effective medium , which is applicable as long as the optical wave length in the structure is much larger than the relevant length scales in the system .",
    "this is a well accepted and frequently stated condition , e.g.  eq.(4 ) of ref.@xcite . near a sharp excitonic resonance ,",
    "however , this condition is violated and the homogeneous medium approximation breaks down .",
    "hence , the nonlocal character of the relation between the electrical field of the light and the polarization of the qd comes into play .",
    "in particular , this holds if the dimensions of the qd become comparable with the exciton bohr radius , see e.g.   the discussion by schmitt  rink et al .   @xcite .    in the bulk of a semiconductor , radiative decay of an exciton is forbidden by conservation of momentum . in a confined structure , however , such decay processes become possible and they are considered to be relevant to estimate the long intrinsic radiative lifetimes of excitons @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal coupling leads to an additional size and polarization dependent line  shift and line width  which contributes to the radiative decay of an exciton in a confined system and , thus , should be taken into account in the analysis of precision experiments .",
    "ultranarrow ( @xmath0 ) photoluminescence lines have been reported@xcite which , presumably , are still broader than the intrinsic line  width . we expect that the width of absorption lines is of the same order . however , with the exception of refs.@xcite , the nonlocal coupling between the polarization and the electric field of the light wave is generally omitted without giving reasons .",
    "the physical motive of our paper is to formulate a sound theoretical basis of optical absorption ( extinction ) in a confined system with the inclusion of nonlocality and to give a reliable prediction of the corrections to the line  shift and line width .",
    "following ivchenko and kavokin@xcite , we solve the scattering problem of an incident electromagnetic wave on a qd with inclusion of the spatial dependence of the polarizability in the vicinity of a single excitonic resonance line .",
    "in addition , we consider the influence of a ( symmetry breaking ) static electric field which uncovers nonlocal effects , sec .",
    "iii contains our numerical results and discussion for a @xmath1 qd in an external electric field .",
    "unexpectedly , the numerical values are rather small but the field induced line shift is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental line  width without field .",
    "hence , the reported corrections may be relevant in future precision experiments .",
    "in linear response theory the relation between the polarization and electric field reads@xcite @xmath2 in a local approximation @xmath3 .",

    "although these experiments refer to photoluminescence rather than to optical absorption similar results for the line  shift and line  width are expected .",
    "there are two sources which cause the excitonic resonance frequency to change with the radius or applied field : change of the `` atomic '' transition frequency @xmath12 in the dot ( = difference of energy levels which is not explicitely considered here ) and the radiation induced shift and damping @xmath71 , @xmath70 which originate from the ( nonlocal ) coupling to the electromagnetic field , see figs .  2,3 .    for @xmath83 :",

    "eventually we list some general results : ( i ) smaller dot radii require larger fields to generate comparable changes of the electronic states , ( ii ) the importance of nonlocal corrections increases with decreasing dot radii and deviations from spherical symmetry , ( iii ) the nonlocal contributions are rather insensitive with respect to the electron ",
    "hole coulomb interaction , and ( iv ) the leakage of the exciton wave function in the host material may be incorporated using an effective radius @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is aproximately the decay length of the ( electron ) wave function , @xmath130 .",
    "although the reported influence of the nonlocal coupling between the light and the polarization of the semiconductor is unexpectedly small , such corrections may be of increasing importance for the analysis of future precision experiments on single qds , in particular in an external field or in non  spherical shaped structures . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the smallest line width reported so far is that of localized biexciton states in a @xmath131 structure at low temperatures which is @xmath132ev@xcite .",
