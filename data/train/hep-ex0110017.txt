    "an additional 1 cm scintillator layer is placed in front of hb to compensate for the energy loss in the cables , electronics and cooling system on the back side of the ecal , which is simulated by a uniform slab of 0.2 @xmath4 of dead material ( readout number 2 ) .",
    "the sampling thicknesses of copper alloy ( 90%cu + 10%zn ) are 5 cm in the barrel segments , except the inner and outer plates which are 7 cm stainless steel .",
    "the 9 mm gaps between the absorber plates are filed with 4 mm scintillator planes ( readout number 3 ) .    to improve the energy measurement for late developing hadron showers ,",

    "the standard calibration uses sampling coefficients for calorimeter parts with different sampling ratio .",
    "the reconstructed energy @xmath5 of simple shower is given by the weighted sum of the energies deposited in the readouts :    @xmath6    where :    @xmath7 - amplitude of the signal from the calorimeter longitudinal segmentation ( readouts ) ;    @xmath8 - calibration coefficients , determined by the minimisation of the width of the energy distributions .",
    "the gaussian part of the reconstructed energy distributions at various incident energies are then fitted to obtain the calorimeter energy resolution .",

    "the linear behaviour of the calorimeter response could be restored by application of the non - linear method which improve the linearity of the calorimeter response and the energy resolution in the broad energy range .",
    "non - linear technique is the selection of some additional energy depended parameters which provide correct energy reconstruction of the showers .",
