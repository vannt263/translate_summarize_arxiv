    "as in many electronic circuits , classes of oscillators and switches are fundamental elements in many gene regulatory networks @xcite . in particular , a double - negative feedback loop comprising two mutually repressive components is known to be capable of functioning as a toggle switch , allowing a system to adopt one of two possible steady states ( corresponding to cell fates ) @xcite . in the context of developmental biology , such bistable switch networks can operate between cells , and are believed to drive cell differentiation in a wide range of contexts .",
    "however , in naturally evolved ( rather than engineered ) gene regulatory networks , double - negative feedback loops rarely exist in a `` pure '' form , and interactions between loop components and other network components often result in sets of interconnected feedback loops . furthermore",

    "the present study investigates the dynamic behaviour of a double - negative feedback loop when the nodes of the loop are involved in additional feedback loops , and when the regulatory steps constituting the resulting network involve significant time delays .",
    "a particularly well documented example of a biological double - negative feedback loop is centred on transmembrane receptors of the notch family .",
    "notch signalling , resulting from direct interaction with transmembrane ligands of the dsl ( delta , serrate and lag-2 ) family on neighbouring cells mediates an evolutionarily - conserved lateral inhibition mechanism that operates to specify differential cell fates during many developmental processes @xcite . although gene nomenclature varies between different organisms , a core circuitry  the neurogenic network  underlying lateral inhibition can be identified , and is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_notch ] @xcite . in brief , signalling between neighbouring cells is mediated by direct ( juxtacrine ) interactions between notch receptors and dsl ligands . a double - negative feedback loop is formed by repression of dsl ligand activity by notch signalling in the same cell ( cell autonomous repression)fig .",

    "the basic principle underlying this switch is the ability of the protein products of the proneural genes to positively regulate transcription of proneural genes , resulting in a direct positive feedback loop . in many systems , including the developing nervous system , notch signalling regulates the proneural switch via regulation of the expression of proteins of the hes / her family . these proteins",
    "act as transcriptional repressors , and can repress their own expression and interfere with proneural self - activation @xcite .",

    "each interaction is not instantaneous but involves a time delay , typically of the order of minutes to tens of minutes @xcite .",
