    "the standard universe model successfully explains the observations of cmbr but there are still some unresolved issues .",
    "inflationary cosmology is proved to be a cornerstone to resolve long - standing theoretical issues including horizon problem , flatness , magnetic monopole issue and origin of fluctuations .",
    "scalar field as a primary ingredient of inflation provides the causal interpretation of the origin of lss distribution and observed anisotropy of cmb @xcite .",
    "inflationary standard models are classified into slow - roll and reheating epochs . in slow - roll period ,",
    "potential energy dominates kinetic energy and all interactions between scalar ( inflatons ) and other fields are neglected , hence the universe inflates @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the universe enters into reheating period where the kinetic energy is comparable to potential energy .",
    "thus the inflaton starts an oscillation about minimum of its potential losing their energy to other fields that present in the theory @xcite .",
    "after this epoch , the universe is filled with radiation .",
    "warm inflation @xcite ( opposite to cold inflation ) has an attractive feature of joining the end stage of inflation with the current universe .",
    "it is distinguished from cold inflation in a way that thermal radiation production occurs during inflationary epoch and reheating period is avoided .",
    "the dissipation effects become strong enough due to the production of thermal fluctuations of constant density which play a vital role in the formation of initial fluctuations necessary for lss formation .",
    "the thermalized particles are produced continuously by microscopic processes which must occur at a timescale much faster than hubble scale @xmath0 , hence the decay rates of the particles must be larger than @xmath1 . during this regime ,",
    "density fluctuation arises from thermal rather than quantum fluctuation @xcite .",
    "warm inflationary era ends when the universe stops inflating , then the universe enters into the radiation dominated phase smoothly .",
    "finally , the remaining inflatons or dominant radiation fields create matter components of the universe @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of the warm inflation scenario from various view points is discussed in @xcite .",
    "their results as a whole show that it is extremely difficult to realize the idea of warm inflation .",
    "dissipative effects could lead to a friction term in the equation of motion for an inflaton field during the inflationary era .",
    "the friction term may be linear as well as localized and is described by a dissipation coefficient .",

    "the primordial density perturbation spectrum is determined by thermal fluctuations rather than vacuum fluctuations while restrictions on the gradient of inflaton potential may be relaxed in strong regime .",
    "inflationary universe has many interesting exact solutions that can be found using an exponential potential often called a power - law inflation . here , the scale factor has a power - law type evolution @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "another exact solution is obtained in the de sitter inflationary universe where a constant scalar potential is considered @xcite .",
    "exact solutions of the inflationary cosmology can also be obtained for two particular scenarios , i.e. , intermediate and logamediate with specific growth of the scale factors @xcite .",
    "this type of expansion is slower than de sitter inflation but faster than power - law inflation , so dubbed as  intermediate \" .",
    "the string or m theory motivates intermediate inflation according to which higher order curvature invariant corrections to the einstein - hilbert action must be proportional to gauss - bonnet terms for the ghost free action .",
    "these terms arise naturally as the leading order in the expansion of inverse string tension @xmath6 to low energy string effective action .",
    "it has been found that 4-dimensional gauss - bonnet interaction with dynamical dilatonic scalar coupling leads to a solution , i.e. , intermediate form of the scale factor @xcite . on the other hand , logamediate inflation ( generalized model of the expanding universe )",
    "is motivated by applying weak general conditions on the indefinite expanding cosmological models @xcite .",
    "these models were originally developed as exact solutions of inflationary cosmology but were best formulated using slow - roll approximation . during slow - roll approximation , it is possible to find a spectral index @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , intermediate inflation leads to @xmath7 for special value @xmath8 ( but this value is not supported by the current observational data @xcite ) that corresponds to the harrizon - zeldovich spectrum @xcite . in both models ,",
    "an important observational quantity is the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath9 , which is significantly non - zero @xcite .",

    "setare and kamali @xcite investigated dynamics of warm inflation with viscous pressure in frw universe model and on the brane with constant as well as variable dissipation and bulk viscosity coefficients . we have extended this work to lrs bi universe model @xcite .",
    "herrera et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the possible realization of an expanding intermediate and logamediate scale factors within the framework of a warm inflationary frw as well as loop quantum cosmology models .",
    "they checked that how both types of inflation work with a generalized form of dissipative coefficient during weak and strong dissipative regimes .",
    "the frw universe is just an approximation to the universe we see as it ignores all the structure and other observed anisotropies , e.g. , in the cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "one of the great achievements of inflation is having a naturally embedded mechanism to account for these anisotropies .",
    "although the new era of high precision cosmology of cmb radiation improves our knowledge to understand the infant as well as the present day universe . there arises a question about the main assumption of an exact isotropy of the cmb .",
    "there are two pieces of observational evidence demonstrating that there is no exact isotropy .",
    "the first is the existence of small anisotropy deviations from isotropy of the cmb radiation and second the presence of large angle anomalies that are shown as real features by the planck satellite results .",
    "this helps to construct an alternative model to decode effects of the early universe on the present day lss without affecting the processes of nucleosythesis @xcite .",
    "bianchi models can be alternatives to the standard frw models with small deviations from exact isotropy to explain anisotropies and anomalies in the cmb .",
    "martinez - gonzalez and sanz @xcite proved that the small quadrupole component of cmb temperature found by cobe implies that if the universe is homogeneous but anisotropic bi then there must be a small departure from the flat friedmann model .",
    "bianchi spacetimes are geometries with spatially homogeneous ( constant @xmath14 ) surfaces which are invariant under the action of a three dimensional lie group .",
    "bianchi type i , the straight forward generalization of the flat frw metric with symmetry group described by @xmath15@xmath16 corresponds to flat hypersurfaces .",
    "following this idea , we extend this work to lrs bi universe model which is a generalization of our previous paper @xcite in which a particular choice of dissipation coefficient @xmath17 is considered .",
