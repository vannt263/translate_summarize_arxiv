    "in the past , bound systems of strongly interacting particles in a nucleus or atom , such as hyperons and mesons , have provided valuable information about various aspects of hadron - nucleon interaction in a many - body environment .",
    "for example , experimental and theoretical studies of hypernuclei led to impressive advances in our knowledge of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions .    until recently it was believed that the @xmath0 meson plays almost no role in nuclear physics because the @xmath3 coupling constant is very small compared to @xmath4 and @xmath5 coupling constants .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to @xmath6-nucleus interaction which has been studied extensively .",
    "the situation has , however , changed recently in medium- and high - energy nuclear reactions where significant amount of pion induced @xmath0 production has been observed at pion energies near 500  mev  @xcite . in view of this , there has been a surge of interest in studying the @xmath0 meson within the framework of nuclear physics .",
    "some of the studies have led to interesting surprises , such as the prediction of the existence of a bound state of @xmath0 meson in a nucleus , termed @xmath0-mesic nucleus , and the phenomenon of `` mesonic compound nucleus '' in high energy pion double - charge - exchange reactions . in this paper",
    ", we will describe the formation of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus and point out the relevant physics that we can hope to learn by using the @xmath0 meson as a nuclear probe .",
    "the existence of @xmath0-mesic nucleus was first predicted by us in 1986  @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the attractive interaction between the @xmath0 meson and all the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the attractive nature of the interaction follows from the work of bhalerao and liu  @xcite who found , from a detailed coupled - channel analysis of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 reactions , that near - threshold @xmath10 interaction is attractive .",
    "the binding energy @xmath11 and width @xmath12 of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus are calculated by solving the momentum - space relativistic three - dimensional integral equation @xmath13 using the inverse - iteration method of kwon and tabakin  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath14 are momentum - space matrix elements of the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 denoting , respectively , the initial and final @xmath0-nucleus relative momenta .",
    "the @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0-nucleus system and @xmath19 is the complex eigenenergy . for bound states ,",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are negative .",
    "three different theoretical approaches to @xmath15 are used to calculate @xmath20 , and they are described below .      the first - order microscopic @xmath0-nucleus optical potential , after using the covariant reduction scheme of celenza et al .",
    "@xcite , has the form@xcite @xmath21 where the off - shell @xmath10 interaction @xmath22 is weighted by the product of the nuclear wave functions @xmath23 corresponding to having the nucleon @xmath24 at the momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 before and after the collision , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus interaction @xmath15 is related to the elementary @xmath10 process by the kinematical transformations of liu and shakin  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 invariant mass @xmath27 in the c.m .",
    "frame of the @xmath0 and the nucleon @xmath24 is given by @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\simeq & \\left [ m_{\\eta}+m_{n}-\\mid\\epsilon_{j}\\mid \\ ; -\\ ; \\frac{{\\bf q}^{2 } } { 2m_{c , j}}\\;\\left ( \\frac{m_{\\eta}+m_{a}}{m_{\\eta}+m_{n } } \\right ) \\right ] ^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & < & ( m_{\\eta}+m_{n})^{2}\\ , \\label{eq:2.1.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the momentum , total energy , and mass of the core nucleus arising from removing a nucleon @xmath24 of momentum @xmath25 and binding energy @xmath32 from the target nucleus having the momentum @xmath33 .",
    "calculation of @xmath15 involves full off - shell kinematics and integration over the fermi motion variable @xmath29 .",
    "it requires knowledge of the basic @xmath22 at subthreshold energies  @xcite .",
    "all kinematic quantities are calculated using well - established lorentz transformations . for near threshold @xmath10 interaction",
    ", only one resonance of the @xmath34 isobar has to be considered for each partial wave .",
    "they are @xmath35 and @xmath36 resonances .",
    "the @xmath10 interaction parameters are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "details of the calculation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".binding energies and half - widths ( both in mev ) of @xmath0-mesic nuclei given by the full off - shell calculation .",
    "no bound state solutions were found for @xmath37 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the binding energies and half - widths given by eq.([eq:2.3.1 ] ) are presented in table  [ table:4 ] for two different values of @xmath38 .",
    "the nuclear form factors are the same as those used in the fa calculations .",
    "for these two scattering lengths , no bound state can exist in @xmath39he . upon comparing the third column of table  [ table:4 ] with the off - shell calculation ( table  [ table:1 ] )",
    ", it can be seen that the on - shell approximation predicts more strongly bound @xmath0-mesic nuclei . also , as expected , the on - shell results for @xmath40  fm are similar to those of fa with @xmath41  mev .",
    "eta - mesic nucleus can affect high - energy pion double - charge - exchange ( dcx ) reactions through the formation of `` mesonic compound nucleus ''  @xcite .",
    "for pion kinetic energies",
    "@xmath42  mev , @xmath0 production channel is open in most nuclei . as a result",
    ", the dcx reaction can proceed via @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "while @xmath45 is in the continuum , @xmath0 can either be in the continuum or in a nuclear bound state .",
    "the dcx amplitudes associated with the @xmath0-nucleus bound states , on the other hand , have resonance structure .",
    "the calculated cross sections for the reaction @xmath46c@xmath47n as a function of @xmath48 at momentum transfers @xmath49 and 210  mev / c are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the solid curves represent the contribution from the resonant amplitude associated with the formation of @xmath0-mesic nucleus .",
    "the dashed curves represent contribution from the nonresonant amplitude only .",
    "the interference of these amplitudes is responsible for the presence of narrow resonance structure at @xmath50  mev for @xmath51  mev / c case .",
    "the width of the resonance is about 10  mev , which reflects the width ( @xmath52  mev ) of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus used in the calculations .",
    "the dcx studies , therefore , can be used as an alternative way to determine the width of @xmath0-mesic nucleus . other processes in which one can expect to see these kind of effects is @xmath53 reactions leading to certain specific final states .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus bound state amplitude for these kind of reactions is not small , in comparison to the nonresonant amplitude .",
    "the study of the resonance pattern in the energy dependence of the cross section can yield information on the relative phase between resonant and nonresonant amplitudes .",
    "several experiments were performed to detect @xmath0-mesic nucleus .",
    "the first experiment at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite in 1987 was based on the work of liu and haider  @xcite .",
    "a second experiment , based on the pion dcx calculations  @xcite was done at lampf by johnson et al .  @xcite .",
    "while these experiments could not confirm unambiguously the existence of @xmath0-mesic nucleus , they did not rule out such a possibility either . in recent publications ,",
    "sokol et al .",
    "@xcite claim to have observed @xmath0-mesic nucleus in experiments involving photo - mesonic reactions .",
    "recently , an experiment has been done at jlich by the cosy - gem collaboration  @xcite , making use of the transfer reaction p@xmath54al@xmath55he@xmath56mg@xmath57 .",
    "analysis of the data clearly indicates the detection of bound state of @xmath0 in @xmath58 mg .",
    "vigorous efforts are also underway to detect bound state of @xmath0 in @xmath59he .",
    "it is claimed that a `` quasibound state '' of @xmath0 in @xmath39he may have been observed in the @xmath60he@xmath0 reaction  @xcite .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the findings of the cosy-11 and cosy - at - wasa groups  @xcite , also looking for the bound state of @xmath0 in @xmath39he in @xmath61 collisions . within the statistical sensitivity achieved by them",
    ", they could not confirm the existence of @xmath62he bound state .",
    "this is in agreement with the predictions presented in this paper .",
    "the formation of @xmath0-mesic nucleus is a natural consequence of the attraction between the @xmath0 meson and the nucleon at very low energies .",
    "however , the attraction is not strong enough to bind an @xmath0 onto a single nucleon .",
    "the bound state formation is possible in a finite nuclei with mass number greater than 10 .",
    "the calculated binding energies and widths of @xmath0-nucleus bound states strongly depend on the subthreshold dynamics of the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "the present analysis indicates that the average @xmath10 interaction energy in mesic - nucleus formation is below the threshold .",
    "what matters for the bound - state formation is not the @xmath10 interaction at the threshold but the effective in - medium interaction . because the subthreshold behavior of @xmath10 interaction is very model dependent , it is useful for theorists to publish not only the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath38 , but also the corresponding subthreshold values as a function of the shift parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the downward shift in the effective interaction energy can lead to a substantial reduction of the attraction of in - medium @xmath0-nucleon interaction with respect to its free - space value .",
    "consequently , predictions based upon using free - space @xmath10 scattering length inevitably overestimate the binding of @xmath0 .",
    "one must bear this in mind when using the predictions given by such calculations as guide in searching for @xmath0-nucleus bound states .",
    "recent experimental confirmation  @xcite of the existence of @xmath0-mesic nucleus will enable us to improve upon the existing models or identify additional physics that has to be incorporated in them . because the binding energies of @xmath0 meson depend strongly on the coupling between the @xmath10 and the @xmath64 channels  @xcite",
    ", studies of @xmath0-mesic nucleus will be able to yield detailed information on the @xmath65 coupling constant involving bound nucleons .",
    "it can also lead to a new class of nuclear phenomenon , @xmath0-mesic compound nucleus resonances .",
    "an awareness of this phenomenon could be helpful to the analysis of nuclear reactions at energies above the threshold for @xmath0 production .",
    "the @xmath0-mesic nuclear levels correspond to an excitation energy of @xmath66 mev , to be compared with an excitation energy of @xmath67 mev associated with the @xmath68- and @xmath69-hypernuclei .",
    "the existence of nuclear bound states with such high excitation energies provides the possibility of studying nuclear structure far from equilibrium .",
