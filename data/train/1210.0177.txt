    "a significant number of quantum computation and quantum information protocols use the quadrature amplitudes of the quantized electromagnetic field @xcite , @xcite . the essence of all these protocols rely in the possibility of producing entangled photons in a nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "the parametric down conversion ( pdc ) @xcite is one of the most often used processes for production of entangled pairs of photons .",
    "however , as for many nonlinear optical processes , pdc is ruled by phase matching whose importance was early recognized @xcite , theoretical treatment of a phase mismatch that occurs during the propagation in the nonlinear medium is complicated and several approximations have been made @xcite , in order to relate the phase mismatch , with the amount of quantum correlations in the spontaneous emission of photons .    at room temperatures",
    "the average number of photons at optical frequencies is very small ( on the order of @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , in the microwave part of the spectrum the number of thermal photons initially present in the nonlinear medium can not be ignored and we expect that they will play a determinant role in the amount of entanglement that can be extracted from the interaction . to our knowledge a comprehensive study of pdc processes with a phase mismatch and at finite temperature of the nonlinear medium has not been addressed .    in this paper",
    "we describe the pdc process with a phase mismatch with a simple model that is the quantum transcription of the classical pdc approach derived by bloembergen @xcite .",
    "this model is valid when the interaction is weak , and when the complex amplitudes of the interacting waves vary slowly with the propagating distance in the nonlinear medium .",
    "our purpose is to relate the joint effect of the temperature of the nonlinear medium and of the phase mismatch , with the degree of entanglement of the down - converted photon states .    to quantify the degree of entanglement in terms of the phase mismatch and of the temperature we use the logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "we show that for finite temperatures there is a minimum time of interaction needed , the _ birth time of entanglement _ ( bte ) , before the system starts to be entangled and that it varies with the temperature and with the phase mismatch . for a given phase mismatch",
    ", we compute the degree of entanglement with the temperature in order to obtain the critical temperature , above which the quantum state becomes separable .",
    "this study allows us to identify what are the regions of joint values of temperature and phase mismatch , where the states of the system are entangled and where they are separable .",
    "finally , we propose a feasible entanglement witness that is directly connected with a dynamical invariant of the system .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec.ii we introduce the hamiltonean of the system with non zero phase matching , and obtain the time dependent bosonic operators . in sec .",
    "iii we compute the _ birth time of entanglement _ and the degree of entanglement in terms of the phase mismatch and of the temperature and , an entanglement witness is proposed . finally in sec.iv",
    "we present the conclusions .",
    "the parametric down conversion is a process where an intense pump wave of frequency @xmath1 , propagates in a nonlinear medium and gives rise to two other modes of smaller frequencies @xmath2 ( the signal ) and @xmath3 ( the idler ) obeying the energy conservation rule @xmath4 . when the interaction is weak , and when the complex amplitudes of the interacting waves vary slowly with the propagating distance so that they can be assumed approximately constant within a distance of a wavelength , it is possible to use the slowly varying envelope approximation derived by bloembergen @xcite in a classical context , to describe the nonlinear interaction with a phase mismatch @xmath5 .",

    "the subscript zero refers to initial time .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined by    @xmath26    @xmath27    equations ( [ time1 ] ) and ( [ time2 ] ) extend the well known result derived in @xcite to take into account the influence of the phase mismatch , and reduces to it when @xmath28 .",
    "because the pump amplitude @xmath29 , is treated as constant , the solution to the parametric interaction ceases to be valid when the number of generated pair of photons is such that determines an appreciable depletion of the pump mode .",
    "the argument of the hyperbolic functions is the squeezing parameter , @xmath30 it depends not only on the dimensionless interaction time @xmath31 , but also on the mismatch .",
    "making @xmath32 in the last equation we obtain the usual squeezing parameter @xmath33 @xcite . for a given interaction time the squeezing parameter decreases with increasing mismatch and we expect that the efficiency of the correlated pair production also decreases with @xmath34 .",
    "in this work , we are interested in the amount of entanglement we can extract from the correlated pair production in terms of the phase mismatch and at finite temperature @xmath35 .    in the spontaneous pdc emission the signal * 1 * and the idler * 2 * modes are initially in the vacuum state @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the initial state of the composite system is the pure and separable state given by the tensor product @xmath38 .",
    "when the nonlinear medium is in thermal equilibrium at temperature t , the initial state of the two modes is a separable mixed state given by the density operator @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the thermal field density operator of mode @xmath22 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "both vacuum and thermal states are gaussian states and since the hamiltonian @xmath48 is bilinear in the field modes , the overall output state is also gaussian and the separability criterion @xcite is completely characterized by the first and the second statistical moments of the quadrature phase operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "these operators can be grouped together in a vector of operators @xmath52 .",
    "the first and the second statistical moments of the quadrature phase operators , will be denoted , respectively , by the vector @xmath53 and by the covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath54 , of elements @xmath55 .",
    "the first moments can be adjusted to zero by local unitary operations which leave invariant entropy and entanglement .",
    "the time dependent covariance matrix @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of the three @xmath57 block matrices @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 the diagonal blocks @xmath58 , @xmath62 are the local cm of modes * 1 * and * 2 * , respectively .",
    "the off - diagonal block , @xmath63 , encode the intermodal correlations ( quantum and classical ) between the two modes .",
    "hamiltonians that are quadratic in the bosonic operators , possess universal quantum invariants , i.e. , certain combinations of variances which are conserved in time independently of the concrete form of coefficients of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these invariants exist due to the symplectic structure of the transformation relating initial and time - dependent values of the quadrature components operators .",
    "concerning the statistical moments , these universal invariants are @xcite @xmath64 defining the quantities @xmath65 the entanglement criterion can be written in a simple form @xmath66 for both vacuum and thermal initial states , we prove in the appendix , that @xmath67 , with @xmath68 . for the initial vacuum state , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .      using the entanglement criterion ( [ criterion ] ) ,",
