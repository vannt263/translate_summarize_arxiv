    "there is an impressive corpus of astrophysical and cosmological observations that indicate that a yet unknown form of non  luminous matter constitutes about 23% of the content of the universe .",
    "this matter can not be baryonic though , as the abundance of baryons in any form is strongly constrained by the inferred primordially synthesized abundances of deuterium and helium , as well as the observed small - scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( see , e.g. , the review in ref .",
    ". however , the observational limits on non  baryonic dark matter in the form of relic stable particles from the big bang are not so strong and , indeed , a wealth of models exist that propose candidates with interaction cross sections , masses and relic densities which are compatible with observations .",
    "generically , any particle physics model that provides a stable weakly  interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is of interest from the point of view of the dark matter problem .",
    "one class of models that are extensively studied for their interest in particle physics are supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "several flavours of supersymmetry are currently under scrutiny at the lhc , and both atlas and cms have already probed parts of the parameter space of specific benchmark models  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model ( mssm ) , which provides a wimp candidate in the lightest neutralino , @xmath0 , a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak neutral gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "assuming @xmath1parity conservation , the neutralino is stable and a good dark matter candidate .",
    "accelerator searches and relic density constraints from wmap data allow a lower limit to be set on the mass of the mssm neutralino  @xcite .",
    "typical lower limits for @xmath2 from such studies lie around 20 gev , depending on the values chosen for tan@xmath3 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgses .",
    "theoretical arguments based on the requirement of unitarity set an upper limit on @xmath2 of 340  tev  @xcite . within these limits , the allowed parameter space of minimal supersymmetry can be exploited to build realistic models which provide relic neutralino densities of cosmological interest to address the dark matter problem .",
    "relic neutralinos in the galactic halo can lose energy through scatterings while traversing celestial bodies , like the sun , and become gravitationally bound into orbits inside .",
    "the build - up of the accreted particles is limited by annihilations , which ultimately create high  energy neutrinos  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present two independent searches for a neutrino flux from the annihilations of neutralinos captured in the center of the sun , performed with the amanda  ii and icecube neutrino telescopes .",
    "the overwhelming majority of triggers in amanda  ii and icecube , @xmath4(10@xmath5/year ) , are due to atmospheric muons reaching the depth of the array .",
    "the analyses are therefore based on the search for up  going muon tracks from the direction of the sun when it is below the horizon , and have been optimized in order to maximize the sensitivity to the predicted signal from mssm neutralinos .",
    "the results can , however , be interpreted generically in terms of any other dark matter candidate which would produce a similar neutrino spectrum at the detector .",
    "the first analysis ( analysis a ) uses the data taken with amanda ",
    "ii during 812 days of livetime in stand ",
    "alone operation between march 2001 and october 2006 . in 2007",
    "the detector was switched to a new data acquisition system ( daq ) which included full waveform recording , and this allowed us to integrate the detector as a subsystem of icecube .",
    "analysis b uses 149 days of livetime collected between april 2008 and april 2009 ( when amanda  ii was decommissioned ) using the new amanda  ii daq and data from both detectors , amanda  ii and icecube .",
    "we have previously published a search for dark matter accumulated in the sun using data taken in 2007 with the 22string configuration of icecube  @xcite . in section  [ sec : combination ] we combine these three independent analyses ( analysis a , analysis b and the results from ref .",
    "@xcite ) which cover the period 20012008 , presenting competitive limits on the muon flux from neutralino annihilations in the sun and limits on the spin  dependent and spin  independent neutralino  proton cross section .",
    "the amanda  ii detector consisted of an array of 677 optical modules ( om ) deployed on 19 vertical strings at depths between 1500  m and 2000  m in the south pole ice cap .",
    "the optical modules consisted of a 20 cm diameter photomultiplier tube housed in a glass pressure vessel connected through a cable to the surface electronics , where the photomultiplier pulses were amplified , time  stamped and fed into the trigger logic .",
    "the inner ten strings used electrical analog signal transmission , while the outer nine strings used optical fiber transmission .",
    "the strings were arranged in three approximately concentric circles of 60  m , 120  m and 200  m diameter respectively .",
    "the vertical separation of the optical modules in strings one to four was 20  m , and 10  m in strings five to nineteen .",
    "several calibration devices ( a 337 nm n@xmath6 laser and three dc halogen lamps , one broadband and two with filters for 350 and 380 nm ) were deployed at several locations in the array . additionally , a yag laser calibration system was set up on the surface , able to send light pulses through optical fibers to a diffuser located at each optical module .",
    "the original amanda  ii data acquisition system could only measure the maximum amplitude of the photomultiplier pulses and only eight hits could be buffered at a time . from 2003",
    ", each channel was connected to a transient waveform recorder ( twr ) , a flash adc that samples at 100 mhz with 12 bit resolution , being able to collect the full photomultiplier waveform in each channel  @xcite .",
    "the twr system was run in parallel with the original daq until 2007 , when the original daq was switched off . from this point , until its decommissioning in may 2009 , amanda  ii was run only with the twr daq system .",
    "the construction of the icecube detector began in 2005 and 40 strings surrounding the amanda  ii array had been deployed by 2008 . with its denser string configuration ,",
    "amanda  ii played the role of a low  energy subdetector of icecube , and both detectors where run in an or configuration until amanda  ii was decommissioned .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ] shows the surface location of the amanda  ii and icecube strings during the 2008 data taking period .",
    "the icecube strings consist of 60 digital optical modules ( doms ) separated vertically by 17  m. the inter  string separation is 125  m. contrary to the amanda  ii optical modules , the icecube doms digitize the photomultiplier signals in  situ .",
    "they are also self  calibrating units , frequently exchanging timing calibration signals with the surface electronics .",
    "a description of the icecube dom and the daq can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "both icecube and amanda ",
    "ii used triggers that selected events based on the number of hit optical modules in a certain time window ( at least 24 modules hit within 2.5 @xmath7s in amanda  ii , and at least 8 modules hit within 5 @xmath7s in icecube ) . additionally , a trigger tailored for low energy events required n hit modules in a given time window out of m consecutive modules in the same string ( n / m condition )",
    "this trigger was set to 6/9 in strings one to four and 7/11 in strings five to nineteen for most of the amanda  ii livetime , with a time window of 2.5 @xmath7s .",
    "the condition was 5/7 in all icecube strings , with a time window of 1.5 @xmath7s .",
    "muons from charged  current neutrino interactions near the array are detected by the cherenkov light they produce when traversing the ice . the hit times along with the known detector geometry and the optical properties of the ice allow the reconstruction of the tracks passing through the detector .",
    "a detailed description of the reconstruction techniques used in amanda and icecube is given in ref .",
    "the simulation of the neutralino  induced neutrino signal was performed using the ` wimpsim ` program  @xcite for a sample of neutralino masses ( 50 , 100 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , 3000 and 5000 gev ) .",
    "two extreme annihilation channels were considered in each case , a soft neutrino channel , @xmath8 and a hard neutrino channel , @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 was chosen for 50 gev neutralinos , since they are assumed to annihilate at rest and this mass is therefore below the @xmath11 production threshold ) .",
    "this choice covers the range of neutrino energies that would be detectable with amanda ",
    "ii / icecube for typical mssm models .",
    "note , however , that neutrinos with energies above about a few hundred gev will interact in the sun , and do not escape ; only the lower energy neutrinos from the decays of the products of such interactions will get out of the dense solar interior .",
    "this cutoff , rather than the wimp mass , sets the neutrino spectrum for wimp masses above 1 tev .",
    "the simulated angular range was restricted to zenith angles between 90@xmath12 ( horizontal ) and 113@xmath12 , with the generated number of events as a function of angle weighted by the time the sun spends at each declination . `",
    "wimpsim ` propagates the neutrinos taking into account energy losses and oscillations in their way out of the sun as well as vacuum oscillations to the earth , giving the expected neutrino flux at the location of the detector for each neutralino mass simulated .",
    "the neutrino ",
    "nucleon interactions in the ice around the detector producing the detectable muon flux were simulated with ` nusigma `  @xcite using the ` cteq6 `  @xcite parametrization of the nucleon structure functions .",
    "the background for the dark matter searches arises from up  going atmospheric neutrinos and mis  reconstructed downward  going atmospheric muons .",
    "we have simulated the atmospheric neutrino flux according to ref .",
    "@xcite , using the ` anis ` program  @xcite , with energies between 10  gev and 325  tev and zenith angles between 80@xmath12 and 180@xmath12 ( vertically up  going ) .",
    "the simulation includes neutrino propagation through the earth , taking into account the earth density profile  @xcite , neutrino absorption and neutral current scattering .",
    "the simulation of atmospheric muons was based on the ` corsika ` air shower generator  @xcite using the south pole atmosphere parameters and the hrandel parametrization of the cosmic ray composition  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated 10@xmath13 interactions , distributed uniformly with zenith angles between 0@xmath12 and 90@xmath12 , and with primary energies , @xmath14 , between 600  gev and 10@xmath13  gev .",
    "we note that the background simulations were not used in the evaluation of the actual background remaining at final cut level in the analyses presented below , but off  source data was used to that end .",
    "background simulations were used as a consistency check at the different steps of the analyses .",
    "muons were propagated from the production point to the detector taking into account energy losses by bremsstrahlung , pair production , photo  nuclear interactions and @xmath15ray production as implemented in the code ` mmc `  @xcite .",
    "the cherenkov light produced by the muon tracks and secondaries was propagated to the optical modules taking into account photon scattering and absorption according to the measured optical properties of the ice at the detector  @xcite , as well as the measured dust layer structure of the ice at the south pole  @xcite .",
    "the ` photonics `  @xcite program was used to this end .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     equivalently to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaa ] ) , we can relate the annihilation rate and the muon flux at the detector , @xmath16 , above the energy threshold @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the differential neutrino cross section for producing a muon with energy @xmath20 from a neutrino of energy @xmath21 .",
    "the term @xmath22 denotes the range of the muon produced with energy @xmath20 , and takes into account energy losses between the production point and the detector location .",
    "for each mass and annihilation channel considered , the integrals have been performed with ` wimpsim ` , providing a relationship between the experimentally obtained limit on @xmath23 and derived limits on @xmath24 and @xmath16 .",
    "if we assume equilibrium between the capture and annihilation rates , the annihilation rate is proportional to the neutralino ",
    "proton scattering cross section , which drives the capture . under the further assumption that the capture rate is fully dominated either by the spin ",
    "dependent ( sd ) or spin  independent ( si ) scattering , we can extract conservative limits on either the sd or the si neutralino  proton cross section from the limit on @xmath24 .",
    "we have followed the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to extract limits on the sd and si cross sections .",
    "this conversion introduces an additional systematic uncertainty in the calculation of the cross sections , due to the element composition of the sun , effect of planets on the capture of halo wimps and nuclear form factors used in the capture calculations .",
    "these effects influence the si and sd calculations differently , and are discussed in ref .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by the conversion are small for the spin ",
    "dependent cross section , 2% , and larger for the spin ",
    "independent cross section , 25% .",
    "we have added these contributions in quadrature in order to obtain the total systematic uncertainty on these quantities that we use in this work .",
    "we just note that recent studies favour a somewhat higher value of the dark matter density , @xmath25 , closer to 0.4  gev/@xmath26  @xcite , than the standard value of 0.3 gev/@xmath26 assumed in our conversion .",
    "since variations in the dark matter density translate inversely into the calculated wimp  proton cross section , the conservative assumption on @xmath25 makes our limits conservative as well . a recent discussion on the effects of uncertainties on the structure of the dark matter halo , the dark matter velocity dispersion and the effect of the gravitational influence of planets on the capture rate of local dark matter has been presented in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results on the quantities described above for each neutralino mass and annihilation channel considered are presented in table  [ tab : results_a ] for analysis a and in table  [ tab : results_b ] for analysis b. the tables show the median of the space angle distribution with respect to the sun , the effective volume for each analysis optimization , the 90% cl limits on the expected signal , on the annihilation rate at the center of the sun , on the muon flux at the earth , and on the spin  dependent and spin  independent neutralino  proton cross sections .",
    "given that the data samples used in the analyses presented in this paper are independent , we can combine the results in a statistically sound way .",
    "since icecube has already published an analysis using the same method on another independent data set , the data collected with the 22string detector in 2007 , we can combine these three analyses and cover a total livetime of 1065 days , stretching from march 2001 to april 2009 .",
    "we use the combined likelihood constructed from the likelihoods of the three analyses , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is now weighted by the livetime @xmath29 and effective volume @xmath30 of each analysis through the weights @xmath31 , defined as @xmath32 we have chosen to show conservative limits and therefore we have used in eq .",

    "analysis case explained in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the combined limit on @xmath23 is now given by @xmath34    the calculation of the combined limits on the annihilation rate and muon flux follows from @xmath23 as in eqs .",

    "proton cross sections , compared with current limits from other experiments .",
    "the shaded area shows the allowed parameter space of the 7parameter mssm , obtained by a grid scan using ` darksusy `  @xcite . in order to choose only allowed models we have taken into account current experimental limits on the neutralino mass from lep  @xcite and limits on the wimp cross section from the cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite direct detection experiments .",
    "we have allowed for a generous range of values of the dark matter relic density @xmath35 around the favored value of wmap  @xcite , accepting models in the scan which predicted values of @xmath35 between 0.05 and 0.2 .    an independent analysis using the point  source search techniques described in ref .",
    "@xcite has been performed , using the sun as another point source , and has been presented in ref .",
    "the analysis used the cuts developed for the point  source search without any further optimization . the only difference being that the estimated energy of the events was not included in the likelihood test in order to avoid the bias to the @xmath36 spectrum used in the optimization of the point  source analysis .",
    "since this data set ( 20002006 ) practically overlaps with that of analysis a , we have not included the results of such an approach in the combination presented above , but the results of the point  source analysis provide a useful confirmation of the robustness of the limits presented in this paper .",

    "we have presented two independent analyses searching for neutralino dark matter accumulated in the center of the sun using the amanda  ii and the 40string icecube detectors , covering different data taking periods .",
    "we have combined the obtained 90% confidence level limits on the muon flux and neutralino  proton spin  dependent and spin  indepenent cross section with the previously published limits from the 22string icecube configuration , to obtain limits corresponding to a total livetime of 1065 days .",
    "we compare these results to the currently allowed mssm7 parameter space , obtained by a grid scan using ` darksusy ` .",
    "the limits on the muon flux are the most constraining so far for neutralino masses @xmath39 gev . assuming that the neutralinos constitute the bulk of dark matter in the galaxy and that they annihilate producing a hard neutrino spectrum at the detector , the combined results of amanda  ii and icecube presented in this paper start to probe the allowed 7parameter mssm space .",
    "this comparison with the mssm is , by construction of these analyses , limited to a model  by  model rejection / acceptance , but is not able to say anything about the relative probability of certain regions of the parameter space with respect to others , neither identify a best  fit model given the results obtained .",
    "this is the reason we have chosen to show the allowed mssm space as a uniform shaded area , since individual model density in the plot would not carry any statistical meaning .",
    "analyses that use experimental results to assign probabilities to the susy parameter space are becoming common . a first evaluation of the possibilities that icecube presents in probing the constrained mssm , including individual model information ,",
    "was done in ref .",
    "a more elaborate analyses in this direction , including event energy and direction information , as well as constraints from direct dark matter search experiments and accelerator results in a global fit to the susy parameter space is being developed by the collaboration with data obtained with the 79string detector .",
    "given that the sun is essentially a proton target and that the muon flux at the detector can be related to the capture rate of neutralinos in the sun , the icecube limits on the spin ",
    "dependent neutralino ",
    "proton cross section are currently well below the reach of direct search experiments , proving that neutrino telescopes are competitive in this aspect . for the spin",
    " independent limits , however , direct dark matter search experiments can be competitive due to the choice of target . indeed , the latest results from the xenon100 collaboration  @xcite , using 100 days of livetime , have already produced stronger spin independent limits than those we present in this paper , as shown in the right plot of figure  [ fig : xsec_limits ] .",
    "however there is some complementarity between direct and indirect searches for dark matter given the astrophysical assumptions inherent to the calculations .",
    "both methods are sensitive to opposite extremes of the velocity distribution of dark matter particles in the galaxy ( low  velocity particles are captured more efficiently in the sun , high  velocity particles leave clearer signals in direct detection experiments ) , as well as presenting different sensitivity to the structure of the dark matter halo ( a local void or clump can deplete or enhance the possibilities for direct detection ) .",
    "the data set used in analysis b covered the time until the decommissioning of the amanda  ii detector in 2009 .",
    "the denser configuration of the amanda ",
    "ii strings was of key importance on increasing the sensitivity to low neutralino masses , while the sparsely spaced icecube strings alone would have yielded a worse result . in order to supplant the role of amanda  ii as a low  energy array",
    ", the icecube collaboration has deployed the deepcore array  @xcite in the clear south pole ice , in the middle of the icecube layout .",
    "deepcore lies about 500  m deeper than amanda  ii and its placement in the center of icecube means that three layers of icecube strings can be used as a veto to reject down  going atmospheric muons .",
    "the deployment of deepcore was finalized in december 2010 and it is currently taking data embedded in the icecube data acquisition system .",
    "deepcore is expected to lower the energy threshold of icecube to the @xmath40(10 gev ) region , and therefore be an important asset in future dark matter searches with icecube .",

    "<S> a search for an excess of muon  neutrinos from dark matter annihilations in the sun has been performed with the amanda  ii neutrino telescope using data collected in 812 days of livetime between 2001 and 2006 and 149 days of livetime collected with the amanda  ii and the 40string configuration of icecube during 2008 and early 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> no excess over the expected atmospheric neutrino background has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these results with the previously published icecube limits obtained with data taken during 2007 to obtain a total livetime of 1065 days . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an upper limit at 90% confidence level on the annihilation rate of captured neutralinos in the sun , as well as the corresponding muon flux limit at the earth , both as functions of the neutralino mass in the range 50  gev5000  gev . </S>",
