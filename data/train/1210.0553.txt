    "sources for @xmath0-violating effects are often categorised into contributions from mixing and from direct decays .",
    "this applies to leptogenesis  @xcite as well , where usually the mixing  @xcite and the direct decays of right - handed singlet neutrinos @xmath1 are accounted for .",
    "of particular interest is the source from mixing , because in the situation where the mass - difference of the right - handed neutrinos is small , it gives rise to a resonantly enhanced @xmath0-asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "besides the right - handed neutrinos , higgs bosons and standard model lepton doublets directly take part in leptogenesis . direct decay asymmetries from higgs bosons and lepton doublets are usually not considered , because in the vacuum , these particles can not decay into heavy right - handed neutrinos . consequently , at zero temperature , there are no kinematic cuts through the propagators of a right - handed neutrino and a lepton- or higgs - doublet that can lead to @xmath0-violation . at finite temperature",
    "however , these cuts contribute to the asymmetry  @xcite , since the plasma continuously absorbs and produces leptons and higgs bosons .",
    "concerning mixing , right - handed neutrinos , as these are sterile , are well suited for the efficient production of asymmetries since flavour off - diagonal ( where we define the flavour of these particles by their mass - eigenstates , in contrast to standard model leptons ) correlations are only damped by the yukawa couplings , which are small by the requirement of a substantial deviation of the right - handed neutrinos from equilibrium .",
    "gauge interactions , in particular in the standard model , are typically much larger than the yukawa couplings of the right - handed neutrinos . however , as these are flavour blind , they do not directly damp off - diagonal flavour correlations .",
    "therefore , also the gauged particles within the standard model or its extensions can lead to substantial @xmath0-violation from mixing . for multiple higgs doublets",
    ", it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that their mixing can be a viable source for leptogenesis . in the present work ,",

    "<S> the asymmetry from lepton mixing is considerably large when the mass ratio between the right - handed neutrinos is of order of a few , while it becomes maxwell - suppressed for larger hierarchies . for an intermediate range between the case of degenerate right - handed neutrinos ( resonant leptogenesis ) and the hierarchical case </S>",
