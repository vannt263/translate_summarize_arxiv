    "since 1980 , the weak parity - violating nucleon - nucleon interaction has typically been described by a meson - exchange potential involving seven weak meson - nucleon coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "the weak interaction changes the parity and isospin ( @xmath1 ) of the nucleon - nucleon pair and perturbatively introduces parity violating admixtures in nuclear wave functions .",
    "the study of the hadronic weak interaction is of great relevance for low energy , non - perturbative qcd . the hadronic weak couplings probe short range correlations between quarks because the quark - quark weak interaction occurs when the distance between quarks is @xmath2 .",
    "the electro - weak standard model predicts that charged current contributions to the weak n - n interaction are suppressed and that , therefore , the measurement of a zero asymmetry in the   reaction would suggest that neither neutral currents nor the strange quark pair sea contribute significantly to the hadronic weak interaction . a non - zero   asymmetry ,",
    "on the other hand , would then establish weak neutral currents as the dominant factor with possibly significant contributions from strange quarks .",
    "the npdgamma experiment is under commissioning at the los alamos neutron scattering center ( lansce ) .",
    "it is the first experiment designed for the new pulsed high flux cold beam line , flight path 12 , at lansce .",
    "npdgamma will determine the very small weak pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath3 in the nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "this coupling constant is directly proportional to the parity - violating up - down asymmetry @xmath4 in the angular distribution of 2.2-mev   with respect to the neutron spin direction ( eqn .",

    "@xmath5 the asymmetry has a predicted size of @xmath6 and our goal is to measure it to 10% accuracy .",
    "the small size of the asymmetry and the high proposed measurement precision impose heavy requirements on the performance of the beam line and apparatus .",
    "it is necessary to achieve high counting statistics while at the same time suppressing any systematic errors below the statistical limit .",
    "the experiment was designed to satisfy these requirements  @xcite .    during commissioning the radiative neutron capture on various target materials",
    "was investigated to look for any asymmetry which may enter as a systematic effect while taking data with the hydrogen target .",
    "the measurements concentrated on materials that can be found within the experimental apparatus and which are interacting with the neutrons .",
    "the targets included al , cu , in , and .",
    "in addition , the known asymmetry in  was used to demonstrate that the array functions as designed and is capable of measuring non - zero asymmetries .",
    "boron is used throughout the experiment , for neutron shielding and to collimate the beam .",
    "aluminum is used in most of the equipment and the beam encounters several millimeter of it , primarily in the windows of the hydrogen target .",
    "cu and in are also used in the target .",
    "it is therefore necessary to establish the size of the @xmath7-asymmetry due to neutron capture on each of these elements .",
    "the npdgamma experiment is located on flight path 12 at the manuel lujan jr .",
    "neutron scattering center at lansce .",
    "the statistical accuracy that can be reached in the npdgamma experiment at lansce is limited by the available cold neutron flux . in a spallation neutron source ,",
    "the neutron flux depends on the proton current , the energy incident on the spallation target , the moderator performance ( brightness ) and the neutron guide performance  @xcite .",
    "the lansce linear accelerator delivers @xmath8  mev protons to a proton storage ring , which compresses the beam to @xmath9  ns wide pulses at the base , at a rate of @xmath10  hz .",

    "the pulsed neutron source allows us to know the neutron time of flight or energy and the installed beam chopper allows us to select a range of neutron energies . in the experiment cave ,",
    "the beam is transversely polarized by transmission through a polarized @xmath19he cell .",

    "is given by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : crss ] , with the intensity essentially determined by the neutron flux . however , the actual signal in the detectors is more closely related to the number of neutrons that capture on the target , the target size , the neutron capture location in the target along the beam direction and the average detector solid angle .",
    "all components between the guide exit and the target have been optimized to ensure that they can properly function while attenuating the beam as little as possible .",
    "this includes optimization of the monitor and spin filter thicknesses , reduction of the aluminum windows on the monitors and the spin flipper and the overall reduction of the experiment length to reduce beam divergence .",
    "in addition to maximizing the number of captured neutrons , a successful asymmetry measurement requires a stable , polarized beam and the ability to reverse the beam polarization without significant losses .",
    "the emitted   have to be detected with high efficiency and with reasonably good angular resolution , which is limited by the finite size of the detectors and targets  @xcite .",
    "the fp12 beam guide was installed to deliver the maximum possible number of low energy neutrons to the experimental apparatus .",
    "fp12 uses an m=3 guide with a @xmath21  @xmath13 cross - sectional area .",
    "the guide is coated with hundreds of layers of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it allows neutrons with 3 times the normal perpendicular velocity to be transmitted , resulting in a large increase in neutron flux as compared to standard guides which employ only @xmath22 coating .",
    "a detailed description of our measurement of the fp12 moderator brightness and performance of the neutron guide is given in  @xcite .",
    "the measured brightness has a maximum of @xmath24 @xmath25 for neutrons with an energy of @xmath26  mev .",
    "the beam chopper incorporates two blades which rotate independently at up to @xmath27  rpm .",
    "the chopper is located @xmath28  m from the surface of the moderator .",
    "since the flight path is about @xmath29  m long and the pulse period is @xmath30  ms the slowest neutrons that reach the end of the guide in each pulse have an energy of about @xmath20  mev .",
    "the blades are coated with a layer of @xmath31 which was determined to be fully absorbing for neutron energies up to @xmath32  mev .",
    "this is used to block the slow neutrons at the tail end of the time - of - flight spectrum when either one or both of the blades cover the beam opening .",
    "the diameter of the blades is @xmath33  m and each blade covers @xmath34  radians of a full circle .",
    "the ability to select only part of the neutron spectrum is an important tool to control systematic errors since it provides the ability to effectively polarize , spin - flip and capture the neutrons .",
    "it prevents the overlapping of very slow neutrons from a previous pulse with the faster ones from the following pulse . at a distance of",
    "about @xmath14  m from the moderator , the time required to fully open or close the beam aperture is @xmath35  ms . during the 2004 commissioning run",
    ", the chopper rotation was phased with the beam pulses such that it began opening at each pulse onset @xmath36 , was fully open @xmath16  ms after pulse onset , began closing about @xmath32  ms after pulse onset and was completely closed about @xmath16  ms later ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mon1sig ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to take beam - off ( pedestal ) data for @xmath37  ms at the end of each neutron pulse , which is needed for pedestal and background studies .",
    "the chopper control feedback loop kept the chopper in phase with the beam pulse to within @xmath38 .",
    "the experiment uses three parallel plate ion chambers , each with a @xmath39 active area as beam monitors . the first ( upstream ) monitor is located immediately after the neutron guide exit .",
    "the second monitor is located downstream of the @xmath40 polarizer to allow _ in situ _ absolute beam polarization measurements to be made .",
    "the third monitor is located downstream of the target and detector array .",
    "it was used during the 2004 commissioning run to study the spin flipper efficiency and will be used to monitor neutron depolarization in the hydrogen target .      after exiting the neutron guide ,",
    "the neutrons are spin filtered by passing through a 12 cm diameter glass cell containing polarized @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath40 spin filters have a number of desirable features  @xcite .",
    "they have large acceptance angles , do not require high magnetic fields as is the case with supermirrors and neutron capture on @xmath40 does not create a @xmath7-ray background . the @xmath40 polarization and",
    "therefore the neutron polarization can be reversed without changing the direction of the holding field , by adiabatic fast passage of the @xmath40 spin .",
    "the neutron polarization can be measured with @xmath42% accruracy and without introducing large magnetic field gradients .",
    "the cross - section for capture @xmath43 of neutrons with spin parallel to the @xmath41 nuclear spin has been measured to be @xmath44 of the total absorption cross - section  @xcite , but is assumed to be zero on theoretical grounds .",
    "so neutrons with spin anti - parallel to the @xmath40 nuclear spin are absorbed while those with spin parallel are mostly transmitted .",
    "if the time of flight ( energy ) of the neutrons is known , then the neutron polarization can be determined directly from the neutron transmission measurements  @xcite .",
    "for npdgamma , the figure of merit is the statistical accuracy that can be reached for a certain running time , which is a product of both , the neutron transmission and polarization @xmath45",
    ". the neutron transmission increases as a function of energy ( decreases as a function of time of flight ) , whereas the neutron polarization decreases as a function of energy ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : npol ] ) ) . in the analysis of the data taken during the 2004",
    "commissioning run the neutron polarization was calculated for each run .",
    "the transmission spectrum obtained for each run was fitted with @xmath46 , using a @xmath40 thickness of @xmath47 , which was measured with an unpolarized cell , during the commissioning run . for each run",

    "the chopper cutoff is completed just below 35 ms tof._,title=\"fig : \" ]      in this experiment the asymmetry is measured continuously since the signals from opposite detectors in a pair are measured simultaneously for each spin state .",
    "however , the efficiency of the @xmath7-ray detectors will change slowly due to a number of effects including temperature and crystal activation and the detector gains can not be matched to an accuracy that would allow an asymmetry measurement to be made for each individual neutron pulse .",
    "in addition , an asymmetry measurement can not be made to the required level of accuracy by simply measuring the signal in a given detector for one spin state and the corresponding signal in the same detector for the opposing spin state , made some time later after the neutron spin has been reversed using the neutron spin filter .",
    "this possibility is precluded because of pulse - to - pulse fluctuations in the beam current .",
    "both situations lead to false asymmetries .",
    "the primary technique for reducing false asymmetries generated by gain non - uniformities , slow efficiency changes and beam fluctuations is fast neutron spin reversal .",
    "this allows asymmetry measurements to be made for opposing detectors , removing sensitivity to beam fluctuations , and for consecutive pulses with different spin states , removing the sensitivity to detector gain differences , drifts , and fluctuations .",
    "the asymmetries can then be measured very close together in time , before significant drift occurs . by carefully choosing the sequence of spin reversal ,",
    "the effects of drifts up to second order can be further reduced . to achieve this fast neutron spin reversal ,",
    "the experiment employs a radio frequency neutron spin flipper ( rfsf )  @xcite which operates according to the principles of nmr , using a @xmath32  khz magnetic field with an amplitude of a few gauss .",
    "the neutron spin direction is reversed when the rfsf is on and is unaffected when it is off . during",
    "the 2004 commissioning run the spin flip efficiency was measured to be about 95% averaged over the beam cross - section .",
    "the npdgamma liquid hydrogen target consists of a cylindrical @xmath10  l target vessel containing the liquid hydrogen , surrounded by a vacuum chamber .",
    "the hydrogen itself and the heat radiation shield , located around the vessel , are cooled by two cryogenic refrigerators . in the cooling process",
    ", the hydrogen is converted to liquid para - hydrogen , from its usual state of mostly ortho - hydrogen , to prevent the depolarization of the neutron spin in the target via spin - flip scattering .",
    "monte carlo calculations indicate that the @xmath32  cm diameter and @xmath32  cm long hydrogen vessel is large enough to capture about 60% of the incident neutron beam .",
    "the beam entrance windows in the vacuum chamber , radiation shield , and target vessel are as thin as possible to efficiently transmit the neutron beam and create minimal prompt capture radiation .",
    "the detector array consists of 48 csi(tl ) cubes arranged in a cylindrical pattern in 4 rings of 12 detectors each around the liquid hydrogen target .",
    "in addition to the conditions set on the detector array by the need to preserve statistical accuracy and suppress systematic effects , the array was also designed to satisfy criteria of sufficient spatial and angular resolution , high efficiency , and large solid angle coverage  @xcite . to measure @xmath4 to an accuracy of @xmath48",
    "the experiment must detect at least @xmath49  from  capture with high efficiency .",
    "the average rate of  deposited in the detectors for any reasonable run - time is therefore high . because of the high rates and for a number of other reasons discussed in  @xcite , the detector array uses accurate current mode  detection .",
    "current mode detection is performed by converting the scintillation light from csi(tl ) detectors to current signals using vacuum photo diodes ( vpd ) , and the photocurrents are converted to voltages and amplified by low - noise solid - state electronics  @xcite .    in current mode detection",
    ", counting statistics appears as the rms width in the sample distribution , due to the fluctuation in the number of electrons produced at the photo - cathode of the vpd , as a result of the quasi instantaneous amount of energy deposited in the csi crystal . during beam on measurements ,",
    "the shot noise rms width is given by  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the amount of charge created by the photo cathode per detected , @xmath52 is the average photo - current per detector and @xmath53 is the sampling bandwidth , set by the @xmath54  ms time bin width in the time of flight spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : cntstats ] shows the rms width for a typical detector , as seen at the preamplifier output .",
    "the width from counting statistics is compared to the rms width seen for beam - off electronic noise .    mv . _ ]    to ensure a timely and accurate measurement of the   asymmetry the detector array must operate at counting statistics which requires the rms width from electronic noise to be significantly smaller than the width observed from real events . for a given @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the rms width expected from the detector design criteria at the preamplifier output is @xmath55  mv .",
    "the error on the expected width is dominated by the accuracy to which we know the efficiency ( number of photo - electrons per mev ) of the detector .",
    "using the known proton current and an appropriate monte carlo model for neutron capture on   the number of photons entering a detector , per time bin , is @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding rms width expected due to neutron counting statistics is @xmath57  mv .",
    "to determine the parity violating asymmetry in neutron - proton capture to the proposed accuracy , any possible _ false _ asymmetry from neutron capture on other materials must be measured .",
    "these asymmetries form a background which introduces a shift in the measured   asymmetry if they are non - zero and , at the very least , produce a dilution of the asymmetry , even if they are zero .",
    "the degree of shift or dilution in the asymmetry is proportional to the size of the background signal , relative to the signal of interest .",
    "we refer to these _ false _ asymmetries as _ neutron capture related or induced",
    "_ systematic effects .",
    "there are also _ instrumental _ systematic effects which arise due to changing equipment properties which may be correlated with the neutron spin .",
    "some of the possible instrumental systematic effects have been briefly mentioned earlier and those related to the detector array in particular are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of systematic effects related to neutron capture and scattering is provided in  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to model or calculate the level of parity - violation in these targets and to establish an upper level of their contribution it must be measured .      due to the @xmath58  g holding field , surrounding the experimental apparatus ,",
    "the neutrons are polarized vertically after leaving the @xmath59he spin filter .",
    "while taking hydrogen data , the parity violating asymmetry in n - p capture is therefore seen in a difference of the number of @xmath7-rays going up and down .",
    "for the ideal experiment , the @xmath7-ray cross section is proportional to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the angle between the neutron polarization and the momentum of the emitted photon .",
    "a third term is introduced if a left - right ( lr ) asymmetry exists @xmath62 .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , the basic expression for the   yield is modified due to limitations in the properties of the experimental apparatus and interaction of neutrons with elements other than hydrogen . in calculating the final combined asymmetry",
    "one asymmetry was calculated for each detector pair and time bin and over any valid sequence of 8 macro pulses with the correct neutron spin state pattern .",
    "a so - called valid 8 step sequence of spin states is defined as ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this pattern suppresses first and second order gain drifts within the sequence .",
    "the measured ( _ raw _ ) asymmetry @xmath64 for each detector pair @xmath65 can be extracted by forming a ratio of differences between detectors in a pair divided by their sum .",
    "after all correction factors have been applied , the final physics asymmetry for a given detector pair , spin sequence @xmath66 , and neutron time of flight @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where the background asymmetries @xmath69 and the relative signal level @xmath70 from the elements that cause them must be measured in auxiliary measurements .",
    "the relative , target out , background levels for the various targets were @xmath71 , depending on the shielding collimation and target geometries .",
    "asymmetries from target out runs were measured to be zero .",
    "@xmath72 is the gain asymmetry between the detector pair and @xmath73 is the asymmetry from pulse to pulse beam fluctuations .",
    "the neutron energy and detection efficiency weighted spatial average detector cosine ( up - down asymmetry ) with respect to the vertical is given by @xmath74 , while the detector sine ( left - right asymmetry ) is given by @xmath75 .",
    "also included are the correction factors due to the neutron beam polarization @xmath76 , the spin flip efficiency @xmath77 and the level of beam depolarization in the target @xmath78 .",
    "the beam depolarization for the targets we report on here was modeled and values for @xmath78 range from @xmath79 to @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to realize that signal fluctuations that are not correlated with the switching of the neutron polarization direction will average out and do nt contribute to any asymmetry .",
    "it is , however , essential that these signals have an rms width that is small compared to the rms width in the asymmetries of interest ( driven by counting statistics ) so that they do not dilute the result and are averaged to zero quickly compared to the time it takes to measure the asymmetry to the desired accuracy .",
    "the product of the gain and beam fluctuation asymmetries was measured to be consistent with zero with a statistical error that was typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the error on the raw asymmetry ( see rms width in table  [ tbl : fnasyvals ] ) .",
    "possible false asymmetries due to electronic pickup and possible magnetic field induced gain changes in the detector vpds have previously been measured and are consistent with zero to within @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the detector pair physics asymmetries as represented by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tbphasy ] can then be combined in error weighted averages over the neutron time of flight spectrum to form a single asymmetry for the entire detector array for a single sequence of beam pulses .",
    "if beam intensity levels are monitored to be reasonably stable over the measurement time these sequence asymmetries can be histogrammed .",
    "typical run lengths were @xmath81 minutes and included 10000 beam pulses or 1250 8-step sequences and the asymmetry measurements performed so far usually extended over several hundred runs .",
    "the known asymmetry in  was used to verify that a nonzero asymmetry can , in fact , be measured with this experimental setup .",
    "the  asymmetry was also used to verify the geometrical dependence of the pair asymmetries . for this purpose ,",
    "each of the 24 pair asymmetries , extracted from the histogrammed 8-step sequence asymmetries from all data obtained with that target , were multiplied by its mean geometry factor and plotted versus its corresponding mean error .",
