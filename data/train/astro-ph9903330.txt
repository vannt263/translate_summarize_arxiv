    "early vlbi polarimetry at 5  ghz revealed surprising differences between strong - lined and weak - lined agn ( loosely , `` quasars '' and `` bl lacertae objects '' ; cawthorne et al .",
    "sources with prominent emission lines , such as the classic quasars 3c273 and 3c345 , are found to have primarily longitudinal magnetic fields in their jets ( `` @xmath0 '' ) , while in weak - lined sources , such as the bl lacertae objects oj287 and bl lac itself , the magnetic field is transverse to the jet axis ( `` @xmath1 '' ) . however , this distinction is not universal , and sources with @xmath0 further out in their jets can also display @xmath1 closer to the core ( leppnen , zensus , & diamond 1995 ) . in the shocked relativistic jet paradigm under which these facts are generally understood ,",
    "knots with @xmath1 are the result of transverse shocks that compress and partially order an initially tangled magnetic field ( hughes , aller , & aller 1985 ) .",
    "regions with @xmath0 are thought to arise from interactions between the jet and the ambient medium , in which shear of the jet flow stretches the magnetic field along the jet ( wardle et al .",
    "1994 ) , or where the jet fluid is compressed against its boundaries ( laing 1980 ) .",
    "however successful , this picture does not explain why sources with different optical characteristics exhibit different jet polarizations . in an attempt to better characterize the relationship between optical and radio properties of active galactic nuclei , we have observed a sample of 45 blazars with the very long baseline array[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( vlba ) at 5  ghz at several epochs ( attridge , wardle , and roberts , in preparation ) .",
    "here we present images of ( also known as j1058 + 0133 , 4c01.28 , da293 , and ol093 ) , a blazar with @xmath2 ( wills & lynds 1978 ) . at this redshift 1",
    "mas corresponds to @xmath3  pc , and a proper motion of 1  mas  yr@xmath4 corresponds to an apparent transverse speed of @xmath5 ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the rest - frame emission - line equivalent widths of this source ( baldwin , wampler , & gaskel 1989 ; falomo , scarpa , & bersanelli 1994 ) , @xmath8(c  iii ]  @xmath91909 )  @xmath10  8   , @xmath8(mg  ii  @xmath92800 )  @xmath10  512   , lie near the boundary @xmath11    used by some authors to divide blazars into weak- and strong - lined categories ( morris et al .",
    "images of  were made from data taken on 1997 january 24 ( epoch 1997.07 ) using all ten antennas of the vlba plus a single antenna from the vla ( `` vlba@xmath12y1 '' ) .",
    "the data were recorded at 5  ghz ( @xmath136  cm ) with a total bandwidth of 64  mhz , and processed on the vlba correlator .",
    "approximately 4  hr were spent on source , leading to a root mean square noise of @xmath1475  @xmath15jy  beam@xmath4 .",
    "calibration and hybrid imaging were done using the nrao aips and caltech difmap packages . in our notation ,",
    "the total intensity is @xmath16 and the linear polarization is represented by the complex quantity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the polarized intensity , @xmath19 is the fractional linear polarization , and @xmath20 is the position angle of the electric vector . the integrated rotation measure of  is @xmath21  rad  m@xmath22 ( kim , tribble , & kronberg 1991 ) , which we take to be galactic .",
    "this amounts to @xmath23 at 5  ghz and has been removed in determining the direction of the magnetic field . any additional faraday rotation in or near",
    "the jet must be unimportant at 5  ghz ; otherwise , we would not find the striking magnetic field configuration described below .",
    "complete details of vlbi polarization calibration and imaging techniques may be found in cotton(1993 ) , roberts , wardle , & brown ( 1994 ) , and aaron ( 1996 ) .",
    "in figure  1@xmath24 we show the total intensity distribution of .",
    "this naturally weighted image has a dynamic range ( peak brightness / off - source noise ) of @xmath1417,000:1 . a typical core - jet source ,  contains a bright unresolved component to the east and a jet extending at least 35  mas to the west northwest .",
    "the jet is resolved transverse to its axis ( deconvolved width @xmath253  mas ) and broadens considerably beyond @xmath1412  mas from the core .",
    "the true nature of the jet is revealed by the linear polarization distribution shown in figure  1@xmath26 ( dynamic range @xmath141100:1 ) .",
    "there we plot contours of linearly polarized intensity @xmath27 with ticks showing the orientation @xmath28 of the jet magnetic field ( assuming optically - thin sychrotron radiation ) .",
    "it is apparent that the jet consists of two distinct parts : ( 1 ) a spine lying along the jet axis and containing a series of knots in which the magnetic field is predominantly perpendicular to the axis , and ( 2 ) a fragmentary boundary layer in which the magnetic field is predominantly parallel to the axis .",
    "figure  2 superposes the @xmath16 and @xmath29 distributions and shows clearly that the @xmath0 regions lie on the outermost visible edges of the jet .",
    "a natural interpretation of this two - component structure is that ( 1 ) transverse shocks dominate within the jet spine , so the net field there is perpendicular to the jet axis , and ( 2 ) in the boundary layer the magnetic field is determined by the jet s interaction with the surrounding emission - line gas , resulting in a longitudinal field .",
    "this configuration is reminiscent of the `` spine - shear layer '' morphology seen in the kiloparsec - scale jets of sources such as 3c31 ( laing 1996 ) and 3c353 ( swain , bridle , & baum 1996 ) .",
    "apparently  displays simultaneously the magnetic field configurations characteristic of both weak- and strong - lined blazars , and as such provides us with an opportunity to study both the shocked - jet paradigm and the relationship between magnetic field orientation and optical properties for blazars .    in figure",
    "3 we show the fractional polarization of . at the jet boundaries",
    "@xmath19 is quite high , exceeding @xmath30 in places , so the magnetic field is well ordered , both across the sky and along the line of sight .",
    "the peak polarization in the jet spine is only @xmath1410% , presumably due to a combination of partially tangled magnetic field in the knots and beam dilution by the unshocked jet ( wardle et al .",
    "there may also be some cancellation by any part of the boundary layer that intersects the line of sight .",
    "the magnetic field in the jet spine is predominantly @xmath1 , so the shocked - jet model predicts the knots to be more highly polarized than the regions between them ( wardle et al .",
    "that this is so can be seen in figure  3 , and provides strong support for this model .",
    "there are some difficulties with the interpretation of the outer jet in as a parsec - scale version of the sheaths seen on much larger scales , i.e. , as the cylindrically symmetric outer layer of a coaxial jet .",
    "first , why is the jet in  so wide so close the core ?",
    "three possibilities suggest themselves : ( 1 ) the true core is east of the easternmost component in our images and invisible either because it points away from us or because it is severely self - absorbed , ( 2 ) the jet initially expands very rapidly but is quickly collimated , perhaps by the same forces that create the boundary layer , or ( 3 ) the jet is initially pointing almost exactly at us , but bends away from the line of sight within the first @xmath31  mas .",
    "second , why are the jet boundaries visible on only one side of the jet at a time ?",
    "perhaps they do not form a complete `` sheath , '' but are those parts of the surface of the jet where the interaction with the ambient medium is strongest , most likely at the outer edges of smooth bends or at places where the jet is deflected .",
    "the jet curves to the south within its first 10  mas and then turns northward over the next 15  mas , which is consistent with this possibility .    on kiloparsec scales ,",
    "is a fanaroff - riley type  ii radio source , with hot spots almost due north and south of the core and a prominent jet in position angle @xmath32 connecting the southern hot spot to the core ; there is no sign of a jet to the north ( murphy , browne , & perley 1993 ) .",
    "this source is thus an example of significant misalignment ( @xmath33 ) of jet orientation between parsec and kiloparsec scales . from tapered versions of figure  1@xmath24 and from 1.6",
    "ghz vlbi ( romney et al .  1984 ; bondi et al .",
    "1996 ) there are suggestions that beyond @xmath14@xmath34  mas from the core the jet continues to bend to the north .",
    "it would appear that on larger scales , the jet must bend through a very large angle ( in projection ) in order to connect with the kiloparsec - scale jet to the south .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the parsec - scale jet continues to the north and that the kiloparsec - scale jet to the south is fed by an as - yet unseen parsec - scale counterjet .",
    "this seems less likely , since it would require _ intrinsic _ bends in both jets of more than @xmath35 , assuming that the visible parsec - scale jet is pointing nearly toward us .",
    "high dynamic range vlba images at lower frequencies , with superior surface brightness sensitivity and wider fields of view , may enable us to locate the bends and determine if and how the parsec- and kiloparsec - scale jets are connected .    using the image presented here and two vlba snapshot images at epochs 1996.02 and 1996.96 , we have determined preliminary proper motions for the three brightest jet spine components relative to the the easternmost component ( the model fits are shown in table  1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the time base is short . for components c1 and c2",
    ", we find upper limits in apparent speed of about @xmath36 . for component c3 , which is closest to the core , we derive a provisional speed of @xmath37 . since the jet spine in  has bright , well - defined knots , it will be straightforward to obtain reliable apparent velocities and accelerations for all of the knots over the next few years .",
    "this will also enable us to determine the physical parameters of the shocks in the jet spine , and their evolution ( wardle et al .  1994 ) .",
    "equally interesting will be attempting to detect proper motions for the boundary layer features .",
    "if this proves possible , the result would be a direct measurement of shear in a parsec - scale relativistic jet .",
    "velocity gradients across kiloparsec - scale jets have been inferred from their polarimetric properties ( laing 1996 ; swain et al .",
    "if similar gradients are common on parsec scales , they may provide a new way to understand the connection between the apparent magnetic field orientation in blazar jets and the equivalent width of their broad emission lines .",
    "we suggest that the spine and the sheath have significantly different lorentz factors @xmath38 : @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , with @xmath41 .",
    "the radiation from the faster - moving spine is beamed into a cone of opening angle @xmath42 , while that of the sheath is beamed into a wider cone of opening angle @xmath43 . at small angles to the line of sight , @xmath44 ,",
    "the polarization image is dominated by the faster moving spine , with its predominantly transverse magnetic field . at @xmath45 ,",
    "the polarization image is dominated by the sheath , with its longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "if we further assume that the optical continuum radiation is also beamed with a lorentz factor @xmath46 , then at small angles to the line of sight , the optical continuum is strongly doppler boosted with respect to the line emission , and the object will be classified as a `` weak - lined blazar . '' at larger angles to the line of sight , the continuum will be far less prominent , and the object will be classified as a `` broad - lined blazar '' ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "close to the core , where the sheath has not fully developed , transverse magnetic fields are likely to be observed in both classes of object ( leppnen et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we conclude that  is a touchstone for a number of important topics in the physics of active galactic nuclei . through it",
    "we can study the formation of the jet - like structure both along and across the axis , including bending and collimation , the conversion of bulk energy to microscopic particle energy and radiation , and the formation , propagation , and decay of shocks .",
