    "such dark matter does not exist in the standard model ( sm ) , has not been conclusively observed to interact non - gravitationally , and has never been detected , directly or indirectly , in a laboratory experiment .",
    "determining the physical properties of dark matter therefore constitutes one of the most pressing questions in high - energy physics . ideally , it would be possible to measure the non - gravitational interactions in several ways : by directly detecting rare ambient dark matter scattering events off a target in underground laboratories , by detecting the products of dark matter self - annihilation or decay , and by measuring a momentum imbalance in collider events .",
    "given that so little is known about the properties of dark matter , the most informative framework for studying dark matter properties in a simplified framework is as model - independent as possible .",
    "one powerful approach is to consider effective operators of dark matter coupling to quarks and other sm particles  @xcite . in the absence",
    "a light mediator below around one gev , the effective operator approach provides an excellent description for interpreting the direct detection experiment results because of the small exchanged momentum in the scattering processes .",
    "a simplified description in terms of such operators neatly encapsulates all possible interactions of dark matter with their detectors . on the other hand",
    ", such operators may be unsuitable or at least not precise for the purposes of collider studies  @xcite .",
    "the latest searches for dark matter at atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite have set a lower bound on the cutoffs of the effective operators to be around one tev .",
    "the current constraints are stringent when compared to the limits derived from direct detection experiments , but are still much below the center - of - mass energy , 8 tev , of the latest run at the lhc",
    ". when the parton - level collision energy is comparable to the mediator mass , the effective theory does not apply and a more complete description is required .    to go beyond an effective operator approach",
    ", one could directly use a concrete underlying model such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to study the complementarity among different experimental probes of dark matter  @xcite . however , to maintain the model - independent paradigm of the effective operator approach , a  simplified dark matter model",
    "\" could be a better choice . in this approach , one can introduce one or two new particles with one or two interactions to probe the potentially complicated dark matter sector . for dark matter interacting with sm particles ,",
    "one of the most important things is the properties of the mediator .",
    "the majority of existing studies in the literature have the mediator particle couple to two dark matter particles at the same time : higgs portal  @xcite , 2hdm portal  @xcite , axion - portal  @xcite , gravity - mediated  @xcite , dilaton - assisted  @xcite and @xmath0-mediated  @xcite  @xcite . in this paper",

    "dark matter particle interacts with quarks via a new qcd color triplet state .",
    "there are several classes of such models depending on the lorentz properties of the dark matter : it may be a dirac fermion , majorana fermion , complex scalar , real scalar , or vector .",
    "the vector case requires an additional scalar field or additional dynamics to provide the vector boson mass and we do not consider it here . for the real scalar dark matter case , the non - relativistic interaction cross - sections including self - annihilation and direct detection are highly suppressed and we do not consider this case either .",
    "therefore , in this paper we perform detailed studies of the dirac fermion , majorana fermion , and complex scalar cases .",
    "a further specification can be made based on species of quarks to which the dark matter couples . at renormalizable level ,",
    "the simplest interactions are to have dark matter particles couple to only right - handed fermions . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the interactions can be transformed as vector or axi - vector couplings between the dark matter particle and the sm fermion .",
    "for either type of couplings , a dark matter particle that couples exclusively to heavy quarks would have a suppressed direct detection cross - section .",
    "we concentrate on the couplings to up and down quarks in this paper and leave the heavy quark case for future exploration .",
    "the six cases that are considered here constitute a set of models for benchmarking the progress of dark matter experiments , as well as for studying the complementarity of different types of experiments .",
    "unlike the effective operator approach , they can be extrapolated to arbitrarily high energies while giving sensible results .",
    "furthermore , they are well - motivated and simple enough to allow for deep experimental scrutiny . in this paper , we demonstrate the power of current experiments to probe these models and determine the allowed parameter space to probe in the future . for each case",
    ", we also show the parameter space to satisfy the dark matter thermal relic abundance .",
    "we pay attention to the potential for current experiments to probe the thermal relic hypothesis .",
    "we find that the parameter space for a thermal relic is highly constrained for most of the scenarios considered , but that there is some potential at the moment in a model with majorana dark matter .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : quark ] , we introduce the fermion portal class of simplified models .",
    "we determine the allowed parameter space for dark matter to be a thermal relic in section  [ sec : relic - abundance ] .",
    "current direct detection and collider constraints are determined in sections  [ sec : direct - detection ] and [ sec : collider ] respectively , with summary plots presented in section  [ sec : collider ] .",

    "if the dark matter sector interacts directly with a single fermion in the sm , two particles with different spins are required in the dark matter sector . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the quark portal dark matter and leave the lepton portal dark matter for future exploration . restricting to particles with a spin less than one , there are two general situations : fermionic dark matter with a color - triplet scalar partner or scalar dark matter with a color - triplet fermion partner . in the former case , we consider both dirac and majorana dark matter , while for the latter case we only consider a complex scalar dark matter and skip the real scalar dark matter case  @xcite , which has a quark mass suppressed @xmath1-wave or a @xmath2-wave or three - body suppressed annihilation rate and a velocity suppressed direct detection cross section if the quark masses are neglected .",

    ", we have concentrated on the complimentarity of collider and direct detection searches .",
    "the indirect searches for dark matter should also play a role , although the current constraint is not that sensitive .",
    "for instance , we have checked that for @xmath99 , a dark matter mass of 100 gev and any mediator mass above the dark matter mass , the new contribution to the anti - proton flux from dirac fermion dark matter annihilations is at least one order of magnitude below the measured flux at pamela  @xcite . because of the @xmath21-wave suppression for the majorana fermion and complex scalar dark matter annihilation cases , the indirect detection constraints are even weaker .",
    "note added : we note here that during the completion of our paper , another paper  @xcite appeared with different emphasis : our paper concentrates more on the complimentarity of direct detection and collider searches for dark matter , while their paper has more focus on the thermal relic parameter space .",
