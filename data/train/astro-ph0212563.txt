    "elliptical galaxies have provided important information on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",

    "* ) , the velocity dispersion  magnitude relation @xcite , and the surface brightness",
    " size relation @xcite .",
    "these relations are regarded as clues to our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "it is widely believed that heating up and sweeping out the galactic gas by multiple supernova ( sn ) explosions play a key role on the formation of dwarf elliptical / spheroidal galaxies . in a traditional framework of monolithic cloud collapse scenario for formation of ellipticals , such multiple sne",
    "cause a galactic wind to halt subsequent star formation and chemical enrichment @xcite . since",
    "a large amount of gas is expelled by the galactic wind , the self - gravitating system expands after blowing up the wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that many observed properties of ellipticals can be reproduced by the galactic wind model with the evolutionary population synthesis technique .",
    "they noticed that theoretical metallicity of galaxies , to be compared with observation , should be an average of metallicities of constituent stars weighted by their luminosities . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite considered a model in which galaxies are embedded in dominant dark haloes .",
    "they claimed that structural properties of luminous matter would not be affected by the gas removal if dark matter dominates the gravitational potential .",
    "their model can also reproduce the observed relations , although they did not take into account the evolutionary population synthesis .",
    "recently , @xcite argued the dynamical limit on occurrence of galactic wind given by the existence of sufficiently dense dark halo and the absence of intergalactic / escaping globular clusters , and concluded that only about 4 per cent of the total mass of the galaxy should be lost by the wind .",
    "in contrast to the monolithic cloud collapse scenario , recent studies on the cosmological structure formation suggest the hierarchical clustering scenario based on a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . in this scenario ,",
    "the cdm dominates the universe gravitationally and objects or dark haloes continuously cluster and merge together , so that larger objects form via mergers of smaller objects .",
    "thus , simple galactic wind models must be modified in order to be consistent with the cosmological structure formation .",
    "based on the hierarchical clustering scenario , semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation have been developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models well reproduce many statistical observables of galaxies such as luminosity function , colour distribution , and gas fraction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that their sams taking into account metal enrichment can reproduce the observed colour  magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies in clusters of galaxies and that this relation reflects the mass - metallicity relation , as pointed out by using the galactic wind model @xcite .",
    "thus , as a next step , it is valuable to investigate not only the photometric properties but structural properties such as size and velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that radial gradients of fractional number , colour , and star formation rate of ellipticals in clusters are also reproduced by using the sam associated with an @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "because a large amount of mass loss might occur during the formation of ellipticals , in both scenarios of monolithic cloud collapse and hierarchical clustering , it is important to construct a formalism on the dynamical response in two - component galaxies consisting of baryon and dark matter .",
    "while self - consistent equilibrium models of such two - component elliptical galaxies have been analysed by @xcite and @xcite , we focus on the dynamical response of baryon within a dark matter halo . in this paper",
    "we consider simple models of two - component galaxies in which the baryon having either de vaucouleurs or exponential profile is embedded in the dark matter having either isothermal or homogeneous profile .",
    "moreover , we also consider the so - called nfw profile of dark matter that is recently suggested by @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section 2 , general formulation for the dynamical response on size and velocity dispersion to mass loss is presented . in section 3 the dynamical response for particular choices of density distributions mentioned above",
    "is investigated .",
    "section 4 summarizes the results of this paper .",
    "the details of models and derivations are given in appendices .",
    "we assume that the velocity fields of gas , stars and dark matter are non - rotating , homogeneous and isotropic characterized by a single parameter of velocity dispersion @xmath1 , and that the density distribution of baryon changes homologously . for simplicity",
    ", it is also assumed that the density distribution of dark matter does not change during the mass loss .",
    "this assumption will be justified for global structural parameters of dark matter because the total mass of dark matter dominates over baryon by a factor of 10 or so .",
    "although the following results will be slightly modified in a dense region of baryonic matter because of non - negligible dynamical response on the local dark matter distribution , the resulting change of baryonic matter should be intermediate between the baryon - dominated and dark matter - dominated cases .",
    "we will study the dynamical response in such limiting cases in section 2.2 .",
    "the response depends on the timescale of gas removal between two extreme cases of adiabatic ( slow ) and instantaneous ( rapid ) gas removal .",
    "when the timescale is longer than the dynamical timescale of the system , it changes adiabatically in quasi - equilibrium . in this case",
    "the total change is a sum of consecutive infinitesimal changes . on the other hand ,",
    "when the timescale of gas removal is much shorter than the dynamical timescale , the system drastically changes and it is possible that our assumption of homologous change might be broken . under realistic circumstances , as hydrodynamical simulations suggest , these timescales are almost similar ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , keeping in mind that the adiabatic gas removal is more consistent with the situation under our assumptions , we consider both adiabatic and instantaneous gas removal below .",
    "a kinetic energy @xmath2 due to velocity dispersion and a gravitational potential energy @xmath3 of baryonic component in a dark matter halo are written as @xmath4 respectively , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants dependent on density distribution , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are characteristic densities of baryon and dark matter , respectively , @xmath1 is velocity dispersion of baryon , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are characteristic radii of baryon and dark matter , respectively , @xmath11 is a radius @xmath9 normalized by @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a function dependent on density distribution .",
    "note that variables related to dark matter , with subscript @xmath14 , do not change during the mass loss . from the virial theorem ,",
    "we obtain @xmath15 @xmath16 where subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the initial and final states , that is , before and after the mass loss , respectively , for the baryonic component . just after the mass loss , only the baryon density changes from @xmath19 to @xmath20 without any changes of other variables .",
    "then , conserving its energy and mass , the system virializes again quickly to the final state , @xmath21 after the mass loss the total mass of baryon also conserves , then @xmath22 . by using this relation ,",

    "the final form is expected to be the same as the result in @xcite . for instantaneous gas removal ,",
    "we obtain from equation ( [ eqn : diff2 ] ) , @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "this is the well - known result that the system becomes unbound if a half of the mass is removed . on the other hand , for adiabatic gas removal",

    "since the third term in equation ( [ eqn : diff2 ] ) overwhelms other terms , @xmath11 does not change against the change of @xmath38 .",
    "thus the velocity dispersion also does not change as obtained by equation ( [ eqn : vel ] ) .",
    "this case corresponds to that of  iii - c in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we confirm that our formulation is applicable to the limiting cases of no dark matter and negligible baryonic matter .",
    "in this section , we consider some specific density distributions . as for the baryonic component ,",
    "we adopt the following two distributions .",
    "one is the jaffe model @xcite that approximates the de vaucouleurs profile when projected , @xmath45 where @xmath7 and @xmath9 are the characteristic density and radius , respectively .",
    "another is a model that approximates the exponential profile when projected , @xmath46.\\ ] ] the details of comparisons of these approximate profiles with the de vaucouleurs and exponential profiles are given in appendix a. as for the dark matter halo , we consider the following two distributions for truncated isothermal and homogeneous spheres , @xmath47 respectively , where @xmath8 is a characteristic density of dark matter and @xmath48 is the heaviside step function .",
    "finally we also consider the nfw profile @xcite , @xmath49^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the concentration parameter .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite suggest a modified nfw profile with steeper slope in the inner core , @xmath51 , we consider only the original nfw profile .    in a hierarchical clustering scenario ,",
    "the isothermal profile should be applied to mergers and starbursts occurring near the centre of dark halo .",
    "this situation is realized when the mergers with satellite galaxies are caused by the dynamical friction .",
    "on the other hand , when satellite - satellite mergers occur in the envelope of dark halo by random collisions , the homogeneous profile should be applied .",
    "recent high resolution @xmath0-body simulations suggest that many subhaloes survive and are not disrupted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if their internal structures are also maintained , the isothermal profile should be applied even in the case of mergers in the envelope of dark halo . moreover",
    ", outer parts of individual subhaloes near the centre of their host halo would be stripped by the tidal force from the host halo , then the mass ratio of baryon to dark matter would be high .",
    "we also consider such a case below .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the dynamical response to mass loss in the case of isothermal dark halo .",
    "as already mentioned , we adopt the jaffe model which well reproduces the deprojected three - dimensional de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the corresponding mass profile for baryon is @xmath52 and for dark matter , @xmath53.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following , we use a parameter @xmath54 that stands for the mass ratio of baryon to dark matter , @xmath55 from the self- and interaction - potential energies of baryon , we obtain the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath6 in equation ( [ eqn : genpot ] ) as follows , @xmath57 and the function @xmath13 is @xmath58 substituting these quantities into equation ( [ eqn : q ] ) for adiabatic gas removal and into equation ( [ eqn : inst ] ) for instantaneous gas removal , we obtain the dynamical response on size to gas removal .",
    "moreover , using equation ( [ eqn : vel ] ) , we also obtain the response on velocity dispersion . because the corresponding equations and solutions are complicated",
    ", we summarize those in appendix [ sec : spec ] .",
    "we examine how the dynamical response depends on the ratio of initial mass of baryon relative to dark matter halo @xmath59 and the ratio of initial radius of baryonic component relative to dark matter halo @xmath60 . in the following we consider two representative values of @xmath61 and 0.05 , and @xmath62 and 0.05 , respectively . in a standard cosmological model ,",
    "the baryon fraction is about 0.1 , so @xmath63 is expected if gas cooling is sufficiently effective .",
    "thus the two values of @xmath64 correspond to two extreme cases in realistic situations .",
    "the size of disk galaxies is usually considered to be a radius at which the disks are supported by their rotation under an assumption that their specific angular momenta conserve while the gas shrinks due to the cooling . the initial value of the specific angular momentum before the cooling is given by the so - called dimensionless spin parameter @xmath65 , which distributes log - normally around 0.05 , derived by the tidal torque due to the large - scale density inhomogeneity in the universe @xcite . because an effective radius of disk is @xmath66 @xcite and the size of elliptical galaxies is not significantly different from the disk size , the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are realistic . if outer parts of individual subhaloes are tidally stripped by their host halo , even larger values might be realized .    in the left panels of figure [ fig : dviso ] ,",
    "we plot the responses on size ( upper panel ) and velocity dispersion ( lower panel ) for @xmath61 .",
    "the thick solid and dashed lines indicate the results of @xmath62 and 0.05 , respectively , for adiabatic gas removal . in the latter case of @xmath67 , because the baryonic component is compact and gravitationally dominates in the central region , the changes of size and velocity dispersion are larger than in the former case of @xmath62 . in the right panels ,",
    "we show the results of @xmath69 .",
    "the changes are smaller when compared to those for @xmath61 because of the small mass of baryonic component .",
    "note that the changes for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are very similar to each other .",
    "the reason is , as pointed out by @xcite , that the changes can be measured by the value of @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath72 is sufficiently small as shown by the thick solid line in the right panels ( @xmath73 ) , the changes are negligible because the mass of dark matter dominates over the baryonic component .",
    "in such a case the assumption of dominant halo by @xcite can be justified .    for reference",
    ", we show the results for instantaneous gas removal by thin lines .",
    "as well known , the changes are greater than those for adiabatic gas removal .",
    "this tendency holds even in the dark matter - dominated case .",
    "note that our results for this case are obtained under the assumption of homologous change , which might not be justified because some masses become unbound and leave the system .",
    "actually , by using @xmath0-body simulations , @xcite showed that some particles initially in the central region of a dark halo become unbound when a part of mass is instantaneously removed .",
    "=      in this subsection , we examine how the dynamical response depends on the density distribution of dark matter component , while the density distribution of baryonic component is fixed to the jaffe model .",
    "first we consider that the dark matter distributes homogeneously .",
    "the mass of dark matter within radius @xmath74 is @xmath75.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the coefficient @xmath6 is @xmath76 and the function @xmath13 is @xmath77 in the same manner as before , we obtain the dynamical response on size and velocity dispersion for this case .",
    "next we consider the nfw profile .",
    "the mass within radius @xmath74 is @xmath78.\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath6 is @xmath79 and the function @xmath13 is @xmath80,\\ ] ] where li@xmath81 is the dilogarithm . in defining the parameter @xmath54 in equation ( [ eqn : defm ] ) , we truncate @xmath82 at @xmath83 , because it logarithmically diverges at @xmath84",
    ". otherwise we do not assume any truncation in the analysis .",
    "the results for adiabatic gas removal are shown in figure [ fig : dvhom ] .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath61 and @xmath67 for all cases and @xmath85 for the nfw profile .",
    "the solid , dashed and dot - dashed lines indicate the isothermal , homogeneous and nfw profiles , respectively . in the case of the homogeneous dark halo , we find that the changes of size and velocity dispersion are larger than those in the case of the isothermal halo and the influence from dark halo is weaker .",
    "this would reflects that the concentration of dark matter is lower than that of the isothermal halo and that the gravitational potential energy from dark matter is smaller , as indicated by the value of the coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the size and velocity dispersion can be significantly affected by mass loss even if surrounded by dark matter , particularly when galaxy mergers frequently occur in the envelope of dark halo .    in the case of the nfw halo with @xmath85 ,",
    "the responses are very similar to those for the isothermal halo .",
    "this is because these haloes have much the same density distributions .",
    "=      in this subsection , we examine how the dynamical response depends on the density distribution of baryon within a given halo .",
    "we consider the exponential - like distribution in the isothermal halo .",
    "the mass within @xmath74 is @xmath86,\\ ] ] where we replace @xmath87 by @xmath88 for simplicity .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath6 are @xmath89 and the function @xmath13 is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the euler constant and @xmath92 is the meijer @xmath93 function ( this symbol should not be confused with the gravitational constant @xmath93 ) .",
    "the results for adiabatic gas removal are shown in figure [ fig : expiso ] .",
    "although we have calculated the exponential profile of baryonic component in the homogeneous halo ( appendix [ sec : exphom ] ) , we do not show this case in the figure , because the response is very similar to that for the de vaucouleurs profile in the homogeneous halo .",
    "the dependence on the density distribution of baryonic component is weaker compared to that of dark matter component , which suggests that the response mainly depends on the density distribution of dark matter .",
    "we analyzed the dynamical response on structural parameters of elliptical galaxies to mass loss . while in the previous analyses",
    "only two limiting cases of pure self - gravitating baryonic system and dark matter - dominated system were considered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we extended the formalism to the intermediate case between the two .",
    "three - dimensional density distributions of baryonic matter considered in this paper are the jaffe model that approximates the de vaucouleurs profile and a model that approximates the exponential profile in two dimensions . as for the density distribution of dark matter ,",
    "a truncated isothermal sphere and a homogeneous sphere are considered . as a more realistic case",
    ", we also considered the nfw dark matter halo which surrounds the baryonic component having de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "thus we found , from five combinations of baryon and dark matter , that the response strongly depends on the central concentration of dark matter , reflecting the fraction of baryon relative to dark matter in the central region .",
    "in contrast to the simple assumption by @xcite that structural parameters are not affected by mass loss , size and velocity dispersion can change even in dark matter , if baryon has sufficiently shrunk and become dense compared to dark matter at the onset of mass loss .",
    "in this paper we considered both adiabatic and instantaneous gas removal .",
    "the adiabatic removal is justified if the timescale of gas removal is sufficiently slow compared to the dynamical timescale of the system . on the other hand , in the case of instantaneous gas removal , the effects of gas removal are stronger . for example ,",
    "when more than a half of the mass is removed instantaneously , the pure self - gravitating system becomes unbound .",
    "thus , our results for adiabatic removal place a lower limit on the dynamical response to mass loss . in order to check the opposite case , we also derived the results for instantaneous gas removal . as expected , the changes of size and velocity dispersion are larger than those for adiabatic gas removal",
    ". such drastic changes may not validate our simple assumptions of homologous expansion of baryon and static distribution of dark matter .",
    "so far some scaling relations such as the velocity dispersion - magnitude relation have been discussed considering the dynamical response to mass loss in the context of monolithic cloud collapse scenario for formation of elliptical galaxies , however , since the resuting structural change of baryonic component is found to depend significantly on the density distribution of dark matter , such scaling relations in the hierarchical clustering scenario should necessarily be reconsidered .",
    "our results suggest that the dispersed properties of dwarf / compact ellipticals would be well reproduced by a variety of their formation histories and environment , when taking into account mass - dependent gas removal .    in the hierarchical clustering scenario ,",
    "galaxy formation processes are rather complicated .",
    "there are many physical processes such as radiative gas cooling and galaxy merger as well as star formation and sn feedback .",
    "it should be noted that the physical mechanism of galaxy merger would be dynamical friction and/or random collision , while the mechanism of dark halo merger is growth of density fluctuation . in order to investigate the observed properties of galaxies , we need to fully incorporate the effects of dynamical response into realistic models of galaxy formation like our sams .",
    "we will discuss various observables of ellipticals in more realistic situations in a forthcoming paper .",
