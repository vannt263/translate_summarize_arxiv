    "early - type galaxies are observed to obey a set of scaling relations that connect their photometric and kinematic properties ( e.g. kormendy relation , kormendy 1977 , faber - jackson relation , faber @xmath13 jackson 1976 ) . among these , the most notable , due to its surprising small scatter ( @xmath14dex ) ,",
    "is the relation between effective radius @xmath15 , mean surface brightness within the effective radius @xmath16 and central velocity dispersion @xmath5 @xcite . in the three - dimensional space ( @xmath17@xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , elliptical galaxies populate a tight plane known as the fundamental plane ( fp ) and usually expressed in the form : @xmath20 if elliptical galaxies formed a homologous family , i.e. systems with density , luminosity and kinematical structures equal over the entire early - type sequence and with constant mass - to - light ratios , then the virial theorem predicts a correlation with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "however , observations show that the plane is somewhat `` tilted '' with respect to virial expectations , with best - fit scalings @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the fp tilt has been much debated and can be interpreted as the breakdown of either of the two assumptions in the virial expectation .",
    "a systematic variation in the mass - to - light ratio along the fp could be due to variations in the stellar content ( age , metallicity or imf ) and/or the amount of dark matter among ellipticals . performing detailed dynamical analyses of 25 galaxies with sauron integral - field stellar kinematics to @xmath15 , @xcite find the `` tilt '' almost exclusively due to real m / l variations of the form @xmath25 , while structural and dynamical non - homologies have negligible effects .",
    "they also find the variation of the dynamical m / l ratio to correlate with the h@xmath26 line - strength , and ascribe most of the tilt to stellar population ( age ) effects . on the other hand ( e.g. la barbera et al .",
    "@xcite , trujillo et al .",
    "@xcite ) other authors find that the tilt is not primarily driven by stellar populations , but instead results from other effects , such as non - homology .",
    "although the fp relation is quite tight , there is none the less a significant scatter around the plane that can not be attributed to measurement errors",
    ". the origin of this intrinsic component has been investigated by many authors .",
    "@xcite found that they were unable to reduce the scatter by introducing additional parameters , such as ellipticity or isophotal shape of the galaxies , into the fp relation .",
    "variations in stellar populations along the sequence of early - type galaxies are found to be partially responsible for the intrinsic scatter ( e.g. gregg 1992 ; guzman @xmath13 lucey 1993 ; guzman , lucey , bower 1993 ) .",
    "prugniel and simien ( 1996 ) studying the correlation between the residuals from the fp and the residuals from the colour and mg@xmath27 line - strength vs. luminosity relations , found that blue and low - mg@xmath27 elliptical galaxies deviate systematically from the value predicted by the fp . following",
    "this evidence forbes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , studying a sample of non - cluster galaxies , found that the residuals of the fp correlate with the ages of the galaxies , i.e. that the scatter of the fp is partly due to variation in galaxy age at a given mass , and in particular to variations in the time of the last starburst . on the contrary",
    ", they found that the effect of changes in metallicity is negligible .",
    "similar results were obtained by reda et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analysing a sample of isolated galaxies : some objects deviate from the fp relation having lower m / l ratio and this was interpreted as due to their younger stellar populations , probably induced by recent gaseous merger .",
    "the same conclusions were reached by wuyts et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for two high - redshift clusters .",
    "they found that the residuals from the fp correlate with the residuals from the h@xmath26 - @xmath5 relation .",
    "this confirms the role played by stellar populations in determining the appearance of the fp , with relations appearing more dispersed for samples of galaxies that are more dispersed in age .",
    "the existence of the fp , its small observed scatter and the tilt have presented a long standing challenge to theoretical models explaining the origin of early - type galaxies .",
    "in fact , whatever the scenario of formation and evolution of early - type galaxies is , it has to be able to explain the existence of such a tight correlation and its deviation from virial expectations and therefore to link galaxy structure and dynamics with their star - formation histories .    in the recent years",
    ", observations and simulations have broadly supported the galaxy merging scenario which fits naturally into the @xmath28cdm hierarchical cosmology ( e.g. steinmetz & navarro , 2002 ) . in the hierarchical scenario",
    "ellipticals form through the merging of disk galaxies @xcite . in the merging context",
    ", significant new insights have been made through large - scale gas dynamical simulations of galaxy mergers @xcite , indicating that for lower mass galaxies , dissipation becomes increasingly important , driving nuclear starbursts that contribute larger mass fractions , and producing systematic trends with mass in both the structures and stellar populations of the remnant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the fp tilt then arises as a direct consequence of the systematic trends with mass of the importance of dissipation during mergers . in the same scenario of galaxy formation",
    ", the origin of the intrinsic scatter in the fp arises as a combination of the scatter in the total baryon - to - dark matter content of the progenitor galaxies , and variations in the dissipational fractions at fixed stellar mass .",
    "this latter factor should be observable as correlations between the residuals from the fp and the stellar population parameters , and represents a critical test of the merger scenario @xcite , through the predicted coevolution of the stellar populations and structures of elliptical galaxies .    the increasing importance of dissipation in the formation of low - mass galaxies and the different mechanisms that drive the evolution and the star - formation histories for low- and high - mass galaxies ( haines et al .",
    "2007 ) should be reflect in variations with mass of the structural and kinematical properties and hence in variations both in the shape and orientation of the fp for these two families of galaxies .",
    "it should also be noted that non - merger origins may be important for lower mass galaxies , whose evolution turns out to be primarly driven by the mass of their host halo , probably through the combined effects of tidal forces and ram - pressure stripping ( haines et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "+    to date no large homogeneous sample of galaxies covering both the giant and dwarf regime exists .",
    "although many fp datasets for systems as different as bcgs , normal es , des , dsphs have been analysed and compared to look for changes in @xmath8 @xcite , these studies suffer from the non - homogenity of the samples both in terms of differences in measuring the quantities entering the fp ( for example different fits to derive structural parameters , different apertures to measure the velocity dispersion ) as well as the selection of galaxies themselves .",
    "the form of the fp obtained can be influenced by all of these criteria .    in this paper",
    "we present a fp analysis of 141 early - type galaxies from the shapley supercluster ( @xmath29 ) with both new @xmath4-band surface photometry measurements and published velocity dispersion measurements from @xcite .",
    "the sample is randomly selected down to @xmath30 and represents the largest homogeneous sample of low - mass early - type galaxies with reliable velocity dispersions down to @xmath31kms@xmath2 . in section 2",
    ", we present the photometric and spectroscopic data ( including velocity dispersion measurements and spectral indices ) and the catalogue of `` newly derived '' structural parameters ; the morphological classification is described in section 3 .",
    "our fp fits for the overall and high-@xmath10 ( @xmath32kms@xmath2 ) samples are presented in section 4 , which discusses how the selection criteria can affect the values of the fp coefficients and mimic a possible curvature of the plane . in section 5",
    "we quantify the contribution of stellar population to the intrinsic scatter .",
    "we discuss our results in section 6 and give a summary in section 7 .",

    "the sample selection is summarized in table 1 . in the region covered by sos",
    "there are 378 confirmed supercluster members .",
    "here we analyse the sample of 141 galaxies which have all the following characteristics : ( i ) an early - type morphology ( see section 3 ) , ( ii ) reliable surface photometry , ( iii ) a measured velocity dispersion and ( iv ) an insignificant h@xmath8 emission ( ew(h@xmath38 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained using the aaomega fibre - fed spectrograph at the anglo - australian telescope .",

    "the fibre diameter of 2arcsec corresponds to 1.9kpc .",
    "long integrations resulted in high signal - to - noise ratios , s / n@xmath1145 per   for @xmath41kms@xmath2 and s / n@xmath1190 per   for @xmath32kms@xmath2",
    ". velocity dispersions were measured with respect to the best - matching simple stellar population ( ssp ) templates .",
    "the errors were estimated from monte carlo simulations , and are @xmath42dex at @xmath41kms@xmath2 and @xmath43dex for @xmath32kms@xmath2 .",
    "the spectral resolution of 3.2  ( 82kms@xmath2 instrumental dispersion ) allows the recovery of velocity dispersions as low as @xmath1140kms@xmath2 .",
    "however , some galaxies in the sample remain kinematically unresolved , i.e. have velocity dispersions consistent with zero .",
    "when comparing the new velocity dispersion measurements with those previously obtained from the nfps ( having a factor @xmath44 lower s / n ) , slh find the new velocity dispersions of low-@xmath10 objects to be systematically lower by @xmath45dex , which they attribute to a combination of higher signal - to - noise and the use of a range of ssp templates rather than individual k - giant stars .",
    "the absorption index data are tabulated by slh .",
    "here we also make use of single - burst equivalent ages , metallicities ( z / h ) and abundance ratios ( @xmath8/fe ) estimated using the models of thomas , maraston @xmath13 bender ( 2003 ) .",
    "details of this process , and the stellar population parameters for each galaxy are provided by smith , lucey @xmath13 hudson ( 2009 ) .",

    "we refer to velocity dispersions measured into an aperture of r@xmath48/8 .",
    "we have corrected our velocity dispersions ( @xmath10@xmath49 ) acquired with fibres of 1 arcsec radius ( r@xmath50 ) to the apertures of r@xmath48/8 following @xcite : @xmath51 hereafter , we adopt the notation @xmath10@xmath52 = @xmath10@xmath53 for the velocity dispersion corrected to this fiducial aperture .    starting from the sample of galaxies observed by slh we select those 396 galaxies belonging spectroscopically to the shapley supercluster ( @xmath54 , blue and red points in figure  [ map ] ) .",
    "for photometry we refer to the sos survey @xcite .",
    "the sos is based on data acquired with the wfi camera ( 4 @xmath55 2 mosaic of 2k @xmath55 4k ccds with a pixel scale of 0.238@xmath56 pixels ) mounted on the eso / mpi 2.2-m telescope at la silla observatory .",
    "@xmath4-band imaging was acquired in good seeing conditions ( @xmath57arcsec ) for eight contiguous fields covering a region of 2deg@xmath58 centred on the shapley supercluster core ( see figure  [ map ] ) .",
    "five exposures were obtained for each field giving a total exposure time of 1200s for the mosaic images ( 240s @xmath55 5 ) .",
    "the reduction was carried out with the alambic pipeline ( version 1.0 , vandame 2004 ) and the catalogue was produced with the sextractor package @xcite , plus a set of procedures designed @xmath59 @xmath60 to remove spurious detections ( bad pixels , cosmic rays , etc ) and correct the photometry for blended sources .",
    "the survey is complete to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "sos photometry is available for 378 supercluster galaxies observed by slh , all of which are detected at signal - to - noise levels greater than 100 in each exposure , such that reliable structural parameters can be derived .",
    "structural parameters were derived using the software 2dphot described by @xcite .",
    "this is an automated tool measuring both integrated and surface photometry of galaxies and is furnished with several tasks to carry out reliable star - galaxy separation , psf modelling and estimation of catalogue completeness .",
    "the main steps of the 2dphot algorithm are : i ) creation of a clean catalogue of the input image with sextractor ; ii ) estimation of the fwhm and the definition of `` sure stars '' ; iii ) construction of an accurate psf model taking into account both possible spatial variations as well as deviation of stellar isophotes from circularity ; iv ) derivation of structural parameters ( effective radius @xmath15 , mean surface brightness @xmath63 , sersic index @xmath64 , total magnitude m@xmath65 , etc . ) by fitting galaxy images with 2d psf - convolved sersic models , as well as the measure of the fit accuracy ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the measurement of structural parameters is strictly dependent both on the psf model and on the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "since the mosaic sos images are obtained by stacking jittered images to cover the gap regions between the eight ccds , the signal - to - noise ratio is not constant among the images being lower in the overlapping gap area .",
    "moreover , in the gap area the psf turns out to be poorly defined due to its spatial variations .",
    "we removed the galaxies in these regions from our sample and performed the surface photometry only for galaxies in highest s / n regions ( 224 galaxies ) , where the psf is well defined .",
    "we correct our mean surface brightnesses for cosmological dimming ( @xmath67= 0.208 mag / arcsec@xmath58 ) , galactic extinction ( @xmath68= 0.147 mag , schlegel et al .",

    "+   +      to derive the errors , we measure the structural parameters on the five single exposures ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 ) , assuming that the observed spread of their values is directly related to the s / n on the final mosaic used to derive the structural parameters entering the fp .    due to the size of the sample ( five exposures ) only two scale estimators can be considered reliable @xcite : the classical standard deviation and the that obtained by the gapper algorithm @xmath76 .",
    "the gapper is a robust scale indicator ( wainer & thissen , 1976 ) based on the gaps between ordered statistics which has a high level of efficiency for samples as small as five objects .",
    "if we have @xmath64 measures of a quantity x ranked in increasing order ( x@xmath77,x@xmath27, ... x@xmath78,x@xmath79 ) , according to the gapper algorithm we can measure a robust scale indicator as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 to avoid an overestimation of the errors due to the presence of outliers , we first compute the @xmath76 of the @xmath82 and @xmath83 distributions and reject all values that deviate more than 3@xmath76 from the median value , before subsequently computing the classical standard deviation as well as the covariance matrices of the clipped sample for both variables ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , cov[@xmath86 ) .",
    "the errors on the mosaic value of @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively ) are given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath64 is the number of measures available .",
    "the typical errors on the logarithms of effective radius ( @xmath87 ) and mean surface brightness ( @xmath88 ) are 0.03 and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "these errors explicitly include the effects of noise in the galaxy , but not the presence of neighbouring objects .",
    "we have estimated the effect of the latter , by repeatedly placing copies of the galaxies one - by - one at random positions across the same ccd image ( where the psf should remain constant ) and reapplying 2dphot , finding the variations in the structural parameters to be consistent with the previously obtained errors , albeit with a small number ( @xmath93% ) of @xmath94 outliers when the galaxy is placed very close to a bright star or galaxy .",
    "we have morphologically classified the 224 galaxies with available surface photometry , by inspection of the residual maps provided by 2dphot .",
    "we denote as  late - type \" all galaxies showing signs of spiral arms or asymmetric disturbance , and as  early - type \" all those with no such structures .",
    "the resolution of sos images does not allow any finer classification , for example into elliptical and lenticular galaxies , since the presence of a residual disk can be seen only in particular cases , i.e. when it is very bright , widespread or edge - on . in figure [ morpho ]",
    "we show some illustrative examples of galaxies classified as early- and late - types , covering the full range of magnitudes studied here .",
    "we have checked this classification by comparing our results with those of @xcite for a subsample of 54 galaxies belonging to a3558 and a3562 , finding perfect agreement . in their classification galaxies",

    "the coma sample is complete at bright magnitudes , but the completeness declines rapidly towards zero at the faint magnitude limit .",
    "in contrast , about 30% of shapley galaxies are spectroscopically observed and have available velocity dispersion measurements independent of magnitude down to m@xmath132 . in the magnitude bins fainter than m@xmath133 , the shapley cf declines gently due to an increasing fraction of galaxies with surface brightnesses and velocity dispersions too low for successful @xmath5 measurements , before dropping rapidly in the faintest bin .",
    "green triangles represent the cf of shapley galaxies observed spectroscopically with no regards to successful velocity dispersion measurements : the decline at faintest magnitude has now disappeared except for the faintest bin ( m@xmath134 ) .",
    "the distribution reflects well the random selection criteria of our spectroscopic survey for @xmath37 galaxies . to compare the fps of the two samples we have selected from shapley only early - type galaxies with m@xmath135 and @xmath136kms@xmath2 (",

    "both the distributions and the dispersions of the two samples are consistent , in fact the fp for coma sample , as found by jfk96 is : @xmath139 the possible reasons for the remaining slight differences between the two fps could be the different sampling at the brightest magnitudes of the two datasets , and the different procedures used to obtain the structural parameters , since jfk96 fit their early - type galaxies with de vaucouleurs profiles .      observing the high-@xmath5 fit ( see figure  [ fp_high ] ) it is notable that all galaxies with velocity dispersions less than 100kms@xmath2 ( low - mass galaxies ) are systematically displaced above ( left panel ) or below ( central panel ) the best - fit plane as defined by the high-@xmath5 sample . in particular , the log@xmath5",
    "edge - on view suggests that low - mass galaxies do not follow the same relation as massive galaxies .",
    "thus , at face value , the fp appears curved , as suggested also by other studies ( jfk96 , zaritsky et al .",

    ", we investigate this possible curvature by analysing the dependence of @xmath8 as a function of different low-@xmath143 limits .",
    "+    we cut the galaxy sample at various values of @xmath5 and estimate the fp coefficients through the weighted orthogonal fit procedure .",
    "one can see that @xmath8 increases systematically as the @xmath5 cut moves to higher values , removing more galaxies from the sample .",
    "the values of @xmath8 for the whole sample ( @xmath8=1.06@xmath1440.06 ) and for the highest-@xmath5 cuts ( @xmath8=1.72@xmath1440.28 ) differ by more than twice the standard errors , indicating a possible curvature of fp . to investigate",
    "if these observed variations of @xmath8 with the sample selection are due to a real curvature of the fp , or induced by selection effects , a set of simulations were performed .",
    "we constructed 1000 mock catalogues using the observed values of log@xmath16 and log@xmath5 and the value of log@xmath15 assigned using the relation : @xmath145 where , in this case , @xmath8 = 0.92 , @xmath26 = 0.78 , and @xmath109 = 0.496 are the coefficients obtained by fitting the fp of the overall shapley sample with log @xmath15 as the dependent variable , @xmath146 = 0.099 is the observed scatter in the log @xmath15 direction , and n(0,@xmath146 ) is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and standard deviation of @xmath146 .",
    "for each mock catalogue we evaluate the relative change in @xmath8 ( @xmath147 ) between the orthogonal fits obtained for the whole sample and after applying a cut at @xmath148kms@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting histogram of @xmath147 values is shown in figure  [ sim ] ,     +    where the dashed line indicates the @xmath147 computed directly for the shapley sample .",
    "this shows that the observed change in @xmath8 is fully consistent with that expected for a linear relation .",
    "moreover , in figure  [ conf_sim ]     +    we compare the fp edge - on projection ( eq .",
    "11 ) for the observed high-@xmath5 sample ( solid symbols ) and a simulated sample obeying the overall shapley fp relation ( open symbols ) .",
    "the two samples show similar behaviour , with the same apparent curvature such that galaxies with low velocity dispersions are placed systematically below the fp relation .",
    "given that the simulated sample is defined to follow a linear relation , this suggests that the apparent curvature in figure  [ fp_high ] can be explained solely by selection biases .",
    "hence , in spite of the wide - range in velocity dispersions covered by our sample , this is not sufficient to distinguish between either a linear or curved fp relation , but there is no convincing evidence for the latter in our data .",
    "we find that for the shapley fp , the contribution of the intrinsic scatter ( 0.070 ) to the total scatter ( 0.092 ) is larger than that of the measurement errors ( 0.060 ) . taking advantage of the wide variety of indices derived by slh",
    "we investigate the possible origin of the intrinsic scatter of the fp analysing the correlations between both spectral indices ( mgb , fe5015 , fe4383 , h@xmath26 , hgf , hdf ) and stellar population parameters ( age , metallicity , @xmath8-enhancement ) and the residuals from the fp .",
    "all of the many spectral indices are known to correlate with @xmath5 , which , if not corrected for , could produce spurious correlations with the fp residuals . to avoid this problem , rather than use the spectral indices themselves , we consider their residuals with respect to the _ index_-log @xmath5 relation . for each index , we fitted first the _ index_-log @xmath5 relation , shown in figures  [ corrindfe ] and  [ corrindba ] ( bottom panels ) for metallicity- and age- sensitive indices respectively , and then determine the residuals with respect to that relation ( middle panels ) . in the figures ,",
    "the upper panels show the _ index_-log @xmath5 residuals versus the residuals from the fp in the log r@xmath48 direction . for each relation , we quantify the product - moment correlations between the residuals and spectral index through the correlation factor @xmath130 and the bisector least - squares fit , assuming that the distributions are both gaussian .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath130 and the fits are estimated through 10000 monte carlo realizations , taking into account the errors on each value .",
    "these values together with the probability @xmath149 that two quantities with correlation factor @xmath130 are not correlated are reported in figures  [ corrindfe ] and  [ corrindba ] .",
    "+     +    among the primarily metal - sensitive indices ( figure 11 ) , the strongest dependence is found for fe4383 , which is correlated with fp residuals at the  4@xmath10 level .",
    "a similar but weaker correlation is obtained for fe5015 . for mgb ,",
    "however , a weak correlation is obtained in the opposite sense .",
    "thus galaxies which are more compact than expected from the fp have lower fe4383 indices than expected for their @xmath5 , but _ higher _ mgb indices than expected for their @xmath5 .",
    "this already provides a hint that the physical driver for the residual trends is not the total metallicity , but instead the ratio between mg and fe abundances .",
    "the balmer lines show weak positive correlations , such that galaxies with strong index values ( for their @xmath5 ) are more diffuse than predicted by the fp .",
    "this could be caused either by age or by metallicity effects , since the balmer lines are sensitive to both parameters to some extent .      using a single spectral index",
    "it is not possible to disentangle between the effects of age and metallicity . in this section ,",
    "we use estimates of age , metallicity and @xmath8-enhancement ( @xmath8/fe ) derived from the index measurements by means of a multi - index procedure , to provide more physically meaningful information ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ) .    as for the single spectral indices , the three stellar population parameters age , metallicity and @xmath8/fe correlate strongly with @xmath5 as shown by the scaling relations of equation [ eqage ] , therefore we first compute the residuals of stellar population parameters with respect to these relations .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ correlations ] show the stellar population residuals against @xmath150 characterized , by construction , by the absence of correlations between the residuals and log @xmath5 itself .",
    "the top panels show the resultant correlations between the age , metallicity and @xmath8/fe residuals ( left , middle and right panel respectively ) and the fp residuals along the log @xmath15 projections .",
    "+    both age and @xmath8/fe are seen to be strongly anti - correlated ( at @xmath93@xmath10 and @xmath94@xmath10 respectively ) with the residuals computed in the @xmath87 direction , while metallicity shows a _ positive _ correlation with the fp residuals along the same axis .",
    "we find these correlations to be independent of the range of @xmath10 covered , for example obtaining consistent results when using only the high-@xmath5 sample . in table",
    "[ percentuale ] we summarize the probability @xmath149 for all the cases .",
    "we note that in the figures 11 , 12 and 13 , the velocity dispersion enters into both axes , since each quantity is a residual from a relation involving @xmath5 .",
    "the errors are hence correlated which will produce a bias towards positive correlations . for each of the primary ssp parameters we measure the level of this bias through monte carlo simulations , based on fake data in which there are no intrinsic correlations .",
    "firstly , for each galaxy we assign fake ssp values ( age , z / h , @xmath8/fe ) following the previously derived index-@xmath5 relations , and having the same rms intrinsic scatter in the ssp value about the relation .",
    "we then perturb each of the values log @xmath5 , log @xmath15 , and log @xmath151 by their uncertainties for each galaxy , and recalculate the residuals about the fp and the index-@xmath5 relation as before . through these simulations , we measure this bias ( @xmath152 r ) , i.e. the difference in the correlation coefficient , due to the correlated measurement errors in @xmath5 and finds : @xmath153 we see that this bias contributes to the observed correlation between the metallicty and fp residuals , but acts to oppose the anti - correlations seen for age and @xmath8-enhancement . in each case",
    "the effect of the bias is small , being at a level of @xmath1110% of the observed correlation .",
    "the relation between residuals obtained taking into account this bias is shown in figure 13 by the red dot - dashed line .",
    "it should be remembered that the stellar population parameters presented here are derived through fixed apertures covering only the galaxy centres .",
    "therefore , if galaxies have significant population gradients , the observed trend could be due to sampling the central stellar populations at different radii . in the case of metallicity",
    ", this may be a factor , as early - type galaxies are observed to have negative metallicity gradients ( kuntschner et al .",
    "2006 ; rawle et al .",
    "2008 ) of the order @xmath154dex in [ z / h ] .",
    "however , spatially - resolved spectroscopy of early - type galaxies show that they generally have flat radial trends in age and @xmath8/fe ( snchez - blzquez et al . 2007 ;",
    "rawle et al .",
    "2008 ) , indicating that the anti - correlation of age and abundance ratios with the fp residuals in the log @xmath15 and log @xmath16 directions is robust .",
    "the strong correlations found between the stellar population parameters , principally the @xmath8/fe , and the residuals of the fp suggest that its scatter is in part due to variations in the stellar populations at fixed galaxy @xmath143 . to this aim",
    "we fit the modified fp relation : @xmath155 where the stellar population parameter spp@xmath156 is , in turn , @xmath8 enhancement , age and metallicity of the galaxies , and study the variation induced in the scatter by keeping @xmath8 and @xmath26 fixed as in eq .",
    "[ simulazione ] and allowing @xmath157 to vary to minimize the fp scatter .",
    "it is necessary to keep @xmath8 and @xmath26 fixed as each of the stellar population parameters correlate strongly with @xmath5 , and hence would introduce spurious variations in @xmath8 .",
    "the results obtained are listed in table [ fit_4dim ] , where the second column indicates the estimated strength of the spp term @xmath157 , the following two columns indicate the overall scatter in the log @xmath15 direction after the addition of the spp term , and the relative intrinsic scatter , and the final column the rms contribution of the ssp term to the scatter in log @xmath15 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the fit with the most significant @xmath157 coefficient ( @xmath158 ) is the fit with the @xmath8/fe as fourth parameter . in the case of age and metallicity ,",
    "the new coefficient is non - zero at just the @xmath113@xmath10 level , indicating the weaker impact of these parameters on the fundamental relation .",
    "while it seems that none of the additional spp terms reduce the overall scatter significantly , the relative impact of the three spp terms becomes clearer when considering the intrinsic scatter ( i.e. after accounting for the measurement uncertainties ) .",
    "both the relation including the effect of age and metallicity have an intrinsic scatter of @xmath159 , only marginally lower than the value without the spp term , while in the case of @xmath8/fe the intrinsic scatter is reduced to 0.049 .",
    "this is comparable to the rms contribution from the @xmath8/fe term ( 0.047 ) , i.e. @xmath8/fe contributes around half of the intrinsic scatter , and indicates that the distribution of galaxies around the fp are tightly related to the enrichment , and hence to the timescale of star - formation .",
    "the @xmath8/fe dependence of the fp scatter is illustrated further in figure  [ split ] which demonstrates also the reduction in total scatter despite the introduction of measurement errors in @xmath8/fe .",
    "we split the shapley sample into three groups ( shown as red , grey and blue points in figure  [ split ] ) according to the position of each galaxy with respect to the @xmath8/fe - log@xmath5 relation ( see left panel ) : the 50@xmath12 of galaxies closest to the relation are plotted in grey , while the 25@xmath12 with @xmath8/fe higher ( lower ) than expected for their @xmath10 are plotted in red ( blue ) . a modest reduction in total scatter",
    "is seen , despite the introduction of uncertainty due to @xmath8/fe measurement errors .",
    "+    furthermore the total fp scatter is reduced by including the extra terms , in spite of the fact that the ssp parameters are subject to their own substantial uncertainties .",
    "this implies there must be a still greater reduction in the _ intrinsic _ fp scatter .",
    "jfk96 pointed out that the dispersion around the fp relation is not completely due to the measurement errors but has an intrinsic scatter whose nature is not yet understood .",
    "the existence of this intrinsic scatter was interpreted as due to another `` fundamental '' parameter characterising the family of early - type galaxies . in many of the previous works on the fp ( see section 1 ) , a strong effort has been made to find correlations between the fp residuals and different line - indices considered to be representative of a particular stellar population parameter ( for example h@xmath26 for age , mg@xmath160 for metallicity etc ) .    in section 5",
    "we showed that the fp residuals are strongly correlated with estimated stellar population parameters especially with the @xmath8-abundance ratio ( @xmath8/fe ) .",
    "given that age and @xmath8/fe are known to correlate strongly for galaxies of a given mass , while age and metallicity anti - correlate ( e.g. proctor & sansom 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "2007b ) , it is not clear which of the three parameters drives the correlations",
    ". however , the fact that the strongest correlation is observed for the @xmath8/fe suggests that this parameter is playing the major role , while age and metallicity trends just reflect their mutual correlations .",
    "the trends observed for the metallicity indices also suggest that the @xmath8/fe is driving the correlations .",
    "in fact , the positive correlations between the z / h dependent indices fe4383 and fe5015 combined with the negative correlation for mgb , is consistent with an anti - correlation for the abundance ratio @xmath8/fe . moreover , we found that about half of the fp intrinsic variance is due to variations in the stellar populations as described by the @xmath8-enhancement trend , while the other stellar population parameters seem to contribute rather less to the intrinsic scatter .",
    "it has long been realised ( tinsley 1980 ) that in the study of galaxy formation and evolution , a major role can be played by the analysis of the abundance ratios , due to them being relatively model independent and primarily affected by stellar nucleosynthesis and the initial mass function ( matteucci 1996 ) . in particular , the ratio between the so - called @xmath8 elements ( synthesized in type ii supernovae ) and iron ( mainly from delayed type ia events ) is widely accepted to be affected by the characteristic timescale of star - formation , the @xmath8 elements and iron having different production timescales ( greggio & renzini 1983 ) . according to the simplest and widely accepted scenario , a galaxy with a high value of @xmath8/fe has experienced many type ii sne events , but almost no sne of type ia during the major epoch of star - formation : this constrains the timescale for this epoch of stellar formation to be shorter than 3@xmath5510@xmath161 years .",
    "our results suggest that the galaxies which formed their stars over a shorter duration ( high @xmath8/fe ) are also those which are more compact .",
    "such a pattern may be expected in a dissipational merger inducing a nuclear sturburst .",
    "vazdekis , trujillo and yamada ( 2004 ) , studing 21 early - type galaxies already claimed the existence of a correlation between sersic index and mg / fe ratio ( i.e. between galaxy structure and stellar population ) , even if they did not correct for correlations with @xmath10 .",
    "they interpreted their results as more massive galaxies having their star formation quenched on shorter time - scales .",
    "although , in agreement with our finding , their analysis is based on to a smaller sample spanning a narrower range of velocity disperisons and luminosities with compared to our shapley sample making any comparisons difficult .",
    "@xcite make specific predictions for the effects of varying the dissipational fraction on the remnant spheroids of a given mass , resulting in correlations between the structural and stellar population parameters . by considering identical progenitor disks ( at @xmath162 ) with initial gas fractions @xmath163 following an exponential star - formation history with time - scale @xmath164",
    ", we have that the gas fraction at the time of the merger @xmath165 ( and hence dissipational fraction in the merger - induced starburst ) will scale as @xmath166 .",
    "if the remaining gas is then consumed in the central star - burst , producing a passively - evolving spheroid remnant , then the dissipational fraction will increase for earlier mergers , and hence mean stellar age .",
    "@xcite also show that ellipticals formed through mergers with higher dissipation fractions should be more @xmath8-enriched . as merger remnants involving more dissipation , like those between more gas - rich disks ,",
    "are expected to yield larger mass fractions formed in nuclear starbursts , which reduce significantly the effective radii of the remnant , we should expect both mean stellar age and @xmath8/fe to anti - correlate with the residuals in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "we observe clear correlations between the fp residuals and age and @xmath8/fe , with those galaxies of a given mass with effective radii smaller than predicted by the fp to have stellar populations systematically older and with higher abundances than average , fully consistent with the predictions of @xcite .",

    "the low value of @xmath8 can be related to the extension of our sample towards very low values of velocity dispersion and and also to the method used to determine @xmath10 . considering the subsample of @xmath6 km s@xmath2 galaxies the fp turns out to follow the relation @xmath171@xmath169@xmath172 which is consistent with the coma fp obtained by jfk96 . observing the significant change in the @xmath8 value between the total and the high-@xmath5 samples , we investigate the possible curvature of the fp . applying the same cuts to a simulated sample following a linear fp relation",
    ", we ascertain that the observed curvature can be explained by selection effects .",

    "similar results were found by hyde @xmath13 bernardi ( 2008 ) studying the fp residuals along the plane . however , these works pointed out that conclusive evidence of the fp curvature needs either more robust statistics or higher accuracy in the velocity dispersion estimates for low mass systems .",
    "the most important result of this work is our demonstration that the fp residuals are correlated with stellar population characteristics ( line- strength indices and derived ssp parameters ) . in particular ,",
    "fp residuals are anti - correlated both with the @xmath8-element abundance ratio , @xmath8/fe , and with galaxy age resulting in trends whereby galaxies more compact than expected from the fp relation have stellar pupulations systematically older and with higher abundances than average .",
    "previous studies have reported correlations of the fp residuals with stellar age ( e.g. forbes et al .",
    "1998 ; reda et al .",
    "although our fp residual do show a correlation with age , we recover a much stronger signal for @xmath8/fe than for age , suggesting that this is the more fundamental dependence .",
    "indeed , a multiple regression analysis suggests there is no age correlation at fixed @xmath8/fe , but a very strong @xmath8/fe correlation at fixed age .",
    "the correlation between @xmath8/fe and fp residuals does not indicate a direct _ causal _ effect , since varying @xmath8/fe at fixed age and z / h has little effect on the stellar mass - to - light .",
    "instead , the correlation suggests that the structural properties and the star - formation history are both dependent on some unobserved aspect of the galaxy assembly process . at face value",
    ", our results are broadly consistent with recent galaxy merger simulations , which predict a sequence of formation mechanisms governed by the varying importance of dissipation ( hopkins et al . 2008 ) . in this scenario ,",

    "<S> we present a fundamental plane ( fp ) analysis of 141 early - type galaxies in the shapley supercluster at @xmath0 based on spectroscopy from the aaomega spectrograph at the aat and photometry from the wfi on the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of the survey is its coverage of low - mass galaxies down to @xmath1kms@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a best - fitting fp relation @xmath3 in the @xmath4 band . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow exponent of @xmath5 is a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions . considering the subsample of @xmath6 km s@xmath2 galaxies , the fp relation is @xmath7 , consistent with previous studies in the high - luminosity regime . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the origin of the intrinsic fp scatter , using estimates of age , metallicity and @xmath8/fe . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fp residuals anti - correlate ( @xmath93@xmath10 ) with the mean stellar age in agreement with previous work . </S>",
    "<S> however , a stronger ( @xmath94@xmath10 ) correlation with @xmath8/fe is also found . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations indicate that galaxies with effective radii smaller than those predicted by the fp have stellar populations systematically older and with @xmath8 over - abundances larger than average , for their @xmath10 . including @xmath8/fe as a fourth parameter in the fp , the total scatter decreases from 0.088dex to 0.075dex and the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 dex to 0.049dex . </S>",
    "<S> thus , variations in @xmath8/fe account for @xmath1130@xmath12 of the total variance around the fp , and @xmath1150@xmath12 of the estimated intrinsic variance . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the distribution of galaxies around the fp are tightly related to the enrichment , and hence to the timescale of star - formation . </S>",
    "<S> our results appear to be consistent with the merger hypothesis for the formation of ellipticals which predicts that a significant fraction of the scatter is due to variations in the importance of dissipation in forming merger remnants of a given mass .    </S>",
