    "granular shear flows have attracted much attention in recent years @xcite . however , theoretical description of _ dense _ granular flows still remains a challenge @xcite .",
    "the present work focuses on a _ rapid dense _ flow of inelastic hard disks , which undergo a shear motion . here",
    ", the medium is fluidized , particle collisions are binary and instantaneous .",
    "this brings about a possibility of a hydrodynamic description of granular media @xcite .",
    "there are still significant difficulties in hydrodynamic description of _ dense _ shear flows , even within the model of inelastic hard spheres .",
    "although for low and moderate densities , a hydrodynamic description with the proper constitutive relations can be derived from kinetic theories @xcite , constitutive relations for dense flows are presently unknown .",
    "several attempts to extend the theory to high densities have been done recently @xcite .",
    "it was proposed to apply free volume arguments @xcite in the vicinity of close packing density , @xmath0 , and use interpolation functions for constitutive relations between low and high density cases @xcite . at high densities",
    ", there is another problem related to the behavior of shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "while inelastic heat losses , thermal conductivity , and pressure diverge at the close packing density @xmath1 , it was shown recently that shear viscosity diverges at a lower density @xcite .",
    "this may result in coexistence of fluid and solid phases @xcite .",
    "we propose here novel interpolation formulas for constitutive relations between low - density and high - density cases , which account for viscosity divergence , and justify them in md simulations .",
    "we employ the resulting granular hydrodynamics for _ quantitative _ description of fluid - solid coexistence in shear granular flow and verify the hydrodynamic predictions in md simulations .",
    "consider a plane couette geometry : an ensemble of inelastically colliding hard disks with unit masses and diameter @xmath2 is driven , at zero gravity , by two walls .",
    "the top wall , located at @xmath3 , moves in the @xmath4-direction with velocity @xmath5 , the bottom wall moves in the opposite direction with the same velocity .",
    "the only parameter that characterizes the inelasticity of collisions is the coefficient of normal restitution , @xmath6 .",
    "boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction are periodic . in the @xmath7-direction , no - flux and no - slip",
    "boundary conditions are implemented . upon a collision with a driving wall , the normal particle velocity switches sign , while the new tangential velocity component is taken from maxwell - boltzmann distribution , with a mean equal to the wall velocity , and a variance corresponding to an instant temperature of the layer next to the wall .",
    "now we present a hydrodynamic approach , which deals with the number density of grains , @xmath8 , the granular temperature @xmath9 , and the mean flow velocity @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the stress tensor , @xmath12 is the heat flux , and @xmath13 is the energy losses due to the inelasticity of particle collisions .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 { \\mathbf i } + 2\\eta(n , t)\\ , \\hat{{\\mathbf d}}$ ] , where @xmath16 $ ] is the rate of deformation tensor , @xmath17 is the deviatoric part of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the identity tensor , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the shear ( first ) and bulk ( second ) viscosities . the heat flux @xmath12 is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the coefficient of thermal conductivity .",
    "an additional term in the expression for heat flux , proportional to the _ density _ gradient @xcite , can be neglected in the nearly elastic limit @xmath24 we consider throughout this paper . for higher values of inelasticity one",
    "also needs to take into account inelastic corrections to transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "however , the main point of the present paper is addressing the challenging problem of describing a very dense flow and ( as the first step ) it is sufficient to assume the limit of nearly elastic particle collisions .",
    "for dilute and moderately dense granular flows , the enskog - like constitutive relations are derived from kinetic theory @xcite . the shear viscosity , @xmath25 , the thermal conductivity @xmath26 , the inelastic heat losses @xmath27 , and the equation of state @xmath28 are given by @xmath29\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa_e & = & \\frac{8 \\nu\\,t^{1/2}\\,g_e}{\\pi^{3/2}\\,d } \\left[1+\\frac{9\\pi}{16}\\left(1+\\frac{2}{3\\,g_e } \\right)^2\\right]\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma_e & = & \\frac{8(1-r)n\\,t^{3/2}\\,g_e}{\\pi^{1/2}\\,d}\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ p_e&=&n\\,t(1 + 2\\,g_e)\\ , , \\label{enskog}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the solid fraction , and index @xmath32 stays for `` enskog '' . for small and moderate densities and for small inelasticities ,",
    "transport coefficients are in a reasonable agreement with the results of event - driven md simulations @xcite .",
    "for very large densities , one can use free volume arguments @xcite and show that all the constitutive relations ( except for shear viscosity ) diverge at the density of close packing . however , there is strong evidence that at high densities the coefficient of shear viscosity behaves differently than other constitutive relations @xcite , diverging at a _ lower _ density than other transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of this finding is a possible existence of a solid - like phase , which is at rest or moves as a whole , as its density is higher than the density of viscosity divergence @xcite .",
    "khain and meerson @xcite considered a very dense three - dimensional system and assumed a leading order expansion of constitutive relations ( except for shear viscosity ) near the close packing density .",
    "however , to employ hydrodynamic equations within a wide range of densities , one needs a pragmatic approach involving interpolation of constitutive relations between the dilute and dense cases @xcite",
    ". we will adapt this approach , suggesting several new interpolation functions , and testing them in md simulations .    to begin with , a global equation of state of hard disk fluid was recently proposed @xcite : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . here",
    ", @xmath35 is an interpolation function , given by @xmath36^{-1}$ ] with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , in a good agreement with md simulations @xcite . according to the same lines , we propose the modified form of inelastic heat losses , changing @xmath40 to @xmath41 in the corresponding expression in eqs .",
    "( [ enskog ] ) . to test this expression in md simulations , we consider a completely different system : a homogeneous freely cooling ensemble of inelastic hard disks in a box . in this case",
    "the third of eqs .",
    "( [ hydr1 ] ) becomes @xmath42 , which gives the well - known haff s law @xcite : @xmath43 .",
    "here temperature is measured in units of the initial temperature @xmath44 , and time in units of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the system width . in our case ,",
    "@xmath47^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we measured the temperature as a function of time in md simulations within a wide range of densities , while other parameters were kept constant . to ensure the homogeneous cooling state being stable @xcite",
    ", we took a sufficiently large restitution coefficient .",
    "as expected , we found the haff s law to be valid and computed the value of @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ constitutive]a shows @xmath48 versus @xmath49 , both from the theory ( solid line ) and md simulations ( circles ) .",
    "a good agreement is observed , in contrast to the enskog predictions ( dashed line ) , which deviate from the results of md simulations at high densities .",
    "the next step is specifying the coefficient of shear viscosity .",
    "consider a dense uniform shear flow . here , the energy balance equation reduces to @xmath50 .",
    "measuring the temperature of the system in md simulations at different densities , we calculate the inelastic heat losses , and compute the shear viscosity @xmath51 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coefficient of shear viscosity of a system of elastic hard disks was measured using the helfand - einstein expressions .",
    "it was found that @xmath51 diverges like @xmath52 , where the viscosity divergence density is @xmath53 , and @xmath54 @xcite , in contrast to the enskog predictions .",
    "our md simulations confirm this result .",
    "figure  [ constitutive]b shows that the enskog formula ( dash - dotted line ) dramatically disagrees with md simulations ( circles ) at high densities .",
    "an interpolation between dilute and dense regime was also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath55 $ ] , see fig .",
    "[ constitutive]b , the dashed line .",
    "since this interpolation is not accurate for the intermediate densities , we propose an improved interpolation function @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the new formula ( solid line ) agrees well with md simulations in a wide range of densities .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coefficient of thermal conductivity @xmath57 was also measured in md simulations .",
    "it was found to be larger than @xmath58 for intermediate densities ( @xmath59 ) , and smaller than @xmath58 for larger densities , @xmath60 ( see fig . 7 in ref .",
    "thermal conductivity is known to diverge at the close packing density , as @xmath61 . incorporating these findings , we propose the following interpolation formula @xmath62 , which is in a good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "now , we apply the resulting granular hydrodynamics to the problem of dense shear flow .",
    "let us measure the coordinate @xmath7 in units of the system height @xmath46 , the horizontal velocity @xmath63 in units of the wall velocity @xmath5 , the temperature @xmath64 in units of @xmath65 , the density @xmath66 in units of @xmath1 , the pressure @xmath67 in units of @xmath68 .",
    "then the steady shear flow ( @xmath69 ) is described by the following system of equations : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the heat loss parameter , and the functions @xmath72 are the density - dependent parts of the constitutive relations : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "no - flux and no - slip boundary conditions are given by @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the total number of particles is conserved , which yields a normalization condition for the density : @xmath80 , where @xmath49 is the average area fraction .",
    "equations ( [ steady ] ) allow for different solutions .",
    "the simplest one is the uniform shear flow . in this case ,",
    "density and temperature are constant , and the velocity profile is linear . for low and moderate densities , it is known that uniform shear flow becomes unstable , when the inelasticity of particle collisions exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "this problem has been analyzed by linear stability analysis of the corresponding equations of granular hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the instability may result in shear - band formation , which was recently observed in md simulations @xcite and analyzed theoretically for moderate densities @xcite , see also @xcite . we found that for high densities , the same instability exists , but its threshold changes qualitatively . indeed , as a result of shear viscosity divergence at @xmath81",
    ", the uniform shear flow solution is impossible at sufficiently large average density , @xmath82 .",
    "when this solution does not exist or is unstable , the density profile is no more homogeneous . in this case",
    ", the regions with the density larger than that of viscosity divergence may appear .",
    "although , those regions are at rest or move as a whole , the granulate is fluidized there and granular temperature is not zero @xcite .",
    "our md simulations show that when @xmath83 is large enough , the system consists of three layers : an inner solid - like layer and two outer fluid layers , see example of a snapshot in fig .  [ snapshot]a .",
    "this fluid - solid coexistence has been recently observed in md simulations @xcite . to describe it hydrodynamically",
    ", one needs to solve eqs .",
    "( [ steady ] ) for each layer separately , demanding continuity of the density , of the heat flux , and of the velocity at the interfaces between the layers . for the solid - like layer , the first equation of eqs .",
    "( [ steady ] ) is replaced by @xmath84 , whose value should be found from the overall solution .",
    "we find the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ steady ] ) using a numerical shooting procedure , similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there exists a family of solutions ( missed in @xcite ) , which can be parameterized by the position of density maximum in the system . in this study",
    "we only consider solutions with a symmetric density profile ( however , other solutions were found in md simulations @xcite for moderately dense systems ) .",
    "consider a solid layer located in the middle of the system , so the density maximum is at @xmath85 ( as in fig .",
    "[ snapshot]a ) .",
    "figure [ snapshot]b shows the density , temperature , and velocity profiles derived both from solution of eqs .  ( [ steady ] ) ( solid lines ) and from md simulations ( circles ) .",
    "the density ( the upper panel ) in the central part of the system ( inside the cluster ) is larger than the density of viscosity divergence .",
    "this results in @xmath86 plateau in the middle ( the lower panel ) .",
    "an excellent agreement between the hydrodynamic theory and md simulations can be seen .",
    "now we consider @xmath87 phase diagram , see fig .",
    "[ threshold ] .",
    "let the average density in the system be smaller than the density of viscosity divergence @xmath88 .",
    "if the hydrodynamic heat loss parameter @xmath83 exceeds the threshold value ( see the dash - dotted line in fig .  [ threshold ] ) @xmath89^{-1}\\ , , \\label{lin}\\ ] ] the uniform shear flow becomes unstable ( details of linear stability analysis will be given elsewhere @xcite ) . above this threshold , different solutions with nonuniform density and temperature profiles are realized .",
    "however , the two - phase solution is possible only when @xmath83 is larger than some critical value @xmath90 ( computed from eqs .",
    "( [ steady ] ) , the solid line in fig .",
    "[ threshold ] ) , so that the density contrast in the system is sufficiently large , and the maximal density is larger than @xmath88 .",
    "an example of this solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ snapshot ] ( which corresponds to the upper asterisk in fig .",
    "[ threshold ] ) . in order to verify the hydrodynamic predictions , we performed md simulations in different regions of the phase diagram .",
    "we found a uniform shear flow solution ( squares ) below the dash - dotted line , while above the solid line , a two - phase solution is realized ( asterisks ) . in the intermediate region ( between the two lines ) there are one - phase solutions with nonuniform density ( and temperature ) profiles .",
    "there are two types of symmetric ( with respect to a density profile ) solutions , which are allowed by eqs .",
    "( [ steady ] ) : the density maximum can be achieved either in the middle ( @xmath85 ) , or near the walls ( at @xmath91 ) .",
    "md simulations show that the system is denser in the middle when the average area fraction is not large enough ( rhombuses ) , while for larger area fractions the density is maximum near the walls ( circles ) .",
    "interestingly , the solution with solid layer in the middle of the system seems to be metastable ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after a sufficiently long time",
    ", the cluster starts slowly moving toward one of the walls until a steady state is reached .",
    "we followed the cluster dynamics by looking on the @xmath7-component of center of mass of the system , and on the velocity in the middle @xmath85 .",
    "both quantities reach a plateau at long times , which corresponds to the position of the cluster near one of the walls . in this case",
    ", the cluster moves as a whole with a velocity which is slightly lower than the wall velocity .",
    "the dynamics of a dense rapid shear granular flow in two dimensions is analyzed both theoretically ( applying granular hydrodynamics ) and by means of event - driven molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we presented a general phase diagram and described different steady - state solutions .",
    "the most interesting solution describes a flow consisting of three layers : an inner solid - like layer and two outer fluid layers .",
    "this solution is possible due to the fact that viscosity diverges at a lower density than other constitutive relations @xcite . a possible direction of future research is increasing the streamwise length of the system . in this case",
    ", the layered structures may give way to wavy patterns @xcite .",
    "for moderate densities , these structures can be explained theoretically @xcite , while for higher densities viscosity divergence should be taken into account .",
