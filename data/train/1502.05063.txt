    "this work deals with the presence of nontopological vortices in generalized maxwell - higgs models recently introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , whose dynamics is controlled by two positive functions depending on the higgs field only . before focusing on this",
    ", however , it seems interesting to first comment on topological solutions .",
    "as one knows , topologically nontrivial configurations , generically named topological defects , are frequently described as static solutions to some nonlinear classical field models allowing for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite . in this sense",
    ", such structures have been studied intensively all over the years , their consequences being applied to many areas of interest , specially in cosmology , since they are known to be formed during symmetry breaking phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the interesting point to be raised is that , according to the usual approach , these solutions can be found by solving a given set of first - order differential equations ( instead of the second - order euler - lagrange ones ) @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of following such a prescription is that it also reveals that the resulting solutions are stable against decaying into the respective mesons ( i.e. they saturate a lower bound for the energy of the model ) , with their energy depending only on the physical fields boundary conditions ( i.e. the topology ) .",
    "the simplest solution  is the static kink coming from a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model described by one real scalar field only @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are also vortices and magnetic monopoles : the first ones are born in ( 1 + 2)-dimensional gauged abelian - higgs theory @xcite , while the second ones stand for the static solutions  appearing in ( 1 + 3)-dimensional gauged non - abelian - higgs models @xcite",
    ".    recently , many authors have also investigated topological configurations coming from generalized models possessing nonusual dynamics . in these works",
    "interesting new properties have been discovered , including variations on the shape of the resulting solitons , see refs .",
    "in addition , some of these models have been verified to support first - order solutions and a lower bound for their energy , see ref .",
    "@xcite . here , it is important to point out that the main motivation regarding noncanonical dynamics comes  in a rather natural way  from the string theory , and that interesting applications of such an idea have been found in connection with the accelerated inflationary phase of the universe @xcite , tachyon matter @xcite , dark matter @xcite , and others @xcite .    in field theory models ,",
    "finite energy solutions require that the self - interacting potential goes to zero as the field solutions approach their asymptotic profiles .",
    "stable nontopological solutions satisfy asymptotical boundary conditions that imply finite energy and null topological charge ( becoming stable due to conservation of noether charges ) .",
    "nontopological defects with vorticity @xmath1 have null profiles at origin and far from it , requiring a @xmath2 potential , as it occurs in the chern - simons - higgs model @xcite and in some extended electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "nontopological solutions were initially studied in models constituted of one and two scalar fields , with applications in qcd birse , lee , see also ref .",
    "some investigations about the conditions under which modified lagrangians , composed of generalized kinetic terms , yield nontopological soliton solutions were undertaken in ref .",
    "the impossibility to attain nontopological solutions in a maxwell - higgs model is associated to the usual @xmath3  self - interacting potential , which provides bps solutions . a generalized maxwell - higgs model with dielectric functions depending on the scalar field ,",
    "was recently proposed @xcite , and may be used to achieve nontopological solutions . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate new aspects of the maxwell - higgs model of ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that it also supports nontopological configurations whenever supplemented with self - interacting potentials that engender symmetric minimum .    in order to present our results , this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the way the adopted nonusual abelian - higgs model engenders self - duality , embracing the first - order equations and the lower bound for the overall energy ( defined in terms of an auxiliary function conveniently introduced ) .  in sec .",
    "iii , we define the scenarios we consider by choosing the higgs potential suitably . in addition , we characterize our solutions by investigating the way they approximate the boundary values , which the physical fields are supposed to reach ( near the origin and asymptotically ) .",
    "we also show that , in the appropriate limit , these models admit the very same analytical solutions and related conclusions .",
    "we go further by presenting numerical profiles , which explicitly describe the general properties of the solutions .",
    "we still point out the existence of models engendering  entirely analytical nontopological solutions ( i.e. not approximate ones ) . finally , in section iv , we present our concluding remarks and perspectives regarding future investigations .",
    "we begin by reviewing the first - order framework firstly introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for attaining topological solutions , whose starting - point is the @xmath4-dimensional generalized maxwell - higgs lagrangian density , @xmath5where @xmath6 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath7 is the minimal covariant derivative . here , we use standard conventions , including the plus - minus signature for the minkowski metric .",
    "the positive functions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , generalize the dynamics of the usual maxwell - higgs model .",
    "it is easy to show that the gauss law of this model is saturated by the temporal gauge , @xmath10 , so it describes only magnetic configurations , as the usual case .",
    "our aim is looking for radially symmetric configurations coming from ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "for such purpose we implement the standard stationary vortex ansatz,@xmath11where @xmath12 stands for the winding number of the topological configuration .",
    "we focus our attention on the self - dual configurations of lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) , governed by two coupled first - order equations that minimize the total energy of the model . in order to obtain such equations",
    ", we follow the usual bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) formalism by writing the energy density of this model in the radially symmetric  ansatz , @xmath13where @xmath14 . in the present scenario ,",
    "self - duality only holds when @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constrained to each other by@xmath18under such a constraint , the energy density eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath19from which one concludes that the corresponding total energy saturates its lower bound when @xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfy@xmath22these are the bps or self - dual first order equations of the generalized model .",
    "saturating the first - order equations , the energy density is shown to be @xmath23where we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath24by using bps  equations , we also can write the correspondent energy density as@xmath25which will be positive definite for @xmath26 . in summary , given @xmath27 , @xmath28and @xmath29  constrained by relation ( [ 6 ] ) , the first - order equations ( 8) and ( [ 9 ] ) give rise to self - dual solutions for both @xmath30  and @xmath31  which satisfying the boundary conditions , @xmath32 a\\left ( 0\\right )   & = & n , \\;~a\\left ( \\infty \\right ) = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\]]engendering topological configurations .",

    "suitable choices of functions @xmath27and",
    "@xmath28  allowed to achieve finite energy bps solutions associated with potentials @xmath29  different from the usual @xmath3  one @xcite , with the energy resulting proportional to the magnetic flux .",
    "so far , no study about the possibility of attaining bps nontopological solutions in this maxwell - higgs framework was developed .",
    "in this section , we show that the generalized maxwell - higgs model of ref . @xcite may also support nontopological radially symmetric solitons , assuming some specific choices for the generalized functions @xmath27  and @xmath28 , and that the first - order equations ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) are solved fulfilling suitable boundary conditions .",
    "we can show that the energy of these bps nontopological magnetic vortices is proportional to the magnetic flux @xmath0 ,  not necessarily quantized in this case . from now on and for simplicity , we choose @xmath37 , and consider only the case @xmath1 , corresponding to the upper signs in eqs .",

    ", the magnetic flux @xmath0 is immediately obtained @xmath42and is not necessarily quantized ( i.e. @xmath41 is not an integer ) .    notwithstanding the magnetic flux",
    "be given by ( [ mf ] ) , it is still possible to define classical field models for which the magnetic flux defines the lower bound for the bps energy ( [ 11a ] ) .",
    "note that this occurs only when the function @xmath43  satisfies boundary conditions proportional to the ones of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , which requires a particular choice for the functions @xmath27  and @xmath28 .",
    "it is well - known that nontopological solutions arise in field theories , which possess at least one symmetric vacuum , and asymptotical conditions compatible with finite energy . in canonical field models , the simplest higgs - potential",
    "consistent with this requirement is the usual sixth - order one , @xmath44where @xmath45 stands for the coupling constant for the scalar - matter self - interaction ( supposed to be dimensionless and positive ) . in this case , the symmetric vacuum is @xmath46 , the asymmetric one standing for @xmath47 . here , we point out that the simplest self - dual maxwell - higgs model ( saturated by the usual @xmath48-potential ) presents only the asymmetric vacuum @xmath47  and does not support nontopological structures . within our generalized scenario , we circumvent this problem by adopting the @xmath49-potential ( [ 13 ] ) , whilst choosing the functions @xmath27  and @xmath28  conveniently .    without loss of generality , and in the context of lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) , we suppose  that the function @xmath50  has the following behavior at boundaries , i.e. when @xmath51,@xmath52with the constants @xmath53,@xmath54,@xmath55,@xmath56characterizing such behavior .",
    "the case @xmath57  allows to express the total bps energy as being proportional to the magnetic flux . in the following we fix @xmath58 .    by using the eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ eq_g ] ) , we should investigate the way the fields @xmath20  and @xmath21 behave near the boundaries .",
    "we thus solve the first - order equations ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) around the boundary values ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , obtaining the behavior of profiles near the origin , @xmath59and asymptotically , @xmath60here , @xmath61  and @xmath62  are positive real constants obtained numerically by requiring proper behavior near and far from the origin , respectively .    the point to be raised here",
    "is that the solutions ( [ g4 ] ) and ( [ g5 ] ) stand for a typical behavior of a topological vortex near the origin whereas eqs .",
    "( [ g6 ] ) and ( [ g7 ] ) encode the typical nontopological profile far from the origin .",
    "it is worthwhile to say that in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the very same dependence in @xmath63  ( despite some numerical factors ) characterizes the nontopological vortices of the usual chern - simons - higgs model .    for small @xmath64 , replacing expressions ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ eq_g ] ) in the self - dual eqs .",

    "we now show  some models belonging to the generalized maxwell - higgs lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) , endowed with the sixth - order potential ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "these models are better characterized by choosing a specific function @xmath74 , from which the constraint ( [ 6 ] ) yields @xmath75 behaving as ( [ eq_g ] ) .    the first model is defined by the potential ( [ 13 ] ) and the functions @xmath76from eqs .",

    "( [ 11a ] ) . from the choices of this model",
    ", we calculate @xmath78  and @xmath79 , so that the total energy is @xmath80thus we verify that the energy of the resulting self - dual structures is proportional to their magnetic flux .",
    "the second @xmath81-model we study is defined by the functions@xmath82whilst the self - dual equations are@xmath83 whose topological solutions were analyzed in ref .",
    "we observe that eqs .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) mimic those of the standard self - dual chern - simons - higgs model @xcite for @xmath84  ( @xmath85 standing for the chern - simons constant ) . despite satisfying the very same differential equations ,",

    "( [ g4 ] ) and ( [ g5 ] ) near the origin , while their asymptotic behavior coincides with the ones of ( [ g6 ] ) and ( [ g7 ] ) .",
    "thus , the solutions coming from ( [ e2 ] ) indeed stand for nontopological self - dual vortices possessing no electric charge .",
    "the total bps energy is computed by using  eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ g ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , leading to @xmath78 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , being proportional to the  magnetic flux again .    at this point , it is interesting to note that because of eqs .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) the values of the winding number @xmath67  are limited by the requirement @xmath88 , otherwise we do not obtain solutions satisfying the boundary conditions or with finite energy .",
    "the third @xmath81-model to be scrutinized is one that affords equations , which have an analytical solution .",
    "it is specified by the functions @xmath89providing the following self - dual equations:@xmath90 the eqs .",
    "( [ e2x ] ) are exactly solvable , having analytical solutions given by ( [ ag ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) , which hold for all @xmath63 ,  not only at origin or at infinity .",
    "these solutions fulfill conditions ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , with @xmath73 , possessing magnetic flux @xmath91 and total energy @xmath92 .",
    "the requirement of a positive - definite energy density ( [ bps_def_pos ] ) or positive @xmath93 in ( [ w3 ] ) is equivalent to demanding @xmath94 , which holds only when@xmath95is satisfied .",
    "therefore , for a given value of the coupling constant @xmath96 , the possible values of the vorticity are limited in such a way that larger values of @xmath68  imply larger values of @xmath67 .",

    "for these values , the winding number is restricted to @xmath99 , @xmath100  or @xmath101  for the first , the second and the third models , respectively .",

    "in general , all the profiles exhibit the same behavior , being ring - like peaks centered at the origin , and vanishing asymptotically .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the way the generalized maxwell - higgs model ( [ 1 ] ) gives rise to self - dual nontopological magnetic vortices possessing finite energy and no electric charge . in order to present our results ,",
    "we have first reviewed the basic features of the model , which engenders self - duality only when a particular constraint ( [ 6 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we have specified our maxwell - higgs models by choosing the usual sixth - order potential ( [ 13 ] ) and changing the function @xmath16 conveniently , from which we have obtained the corresponding expression for @xmath111 from the constraint ( [ 6 ] ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we have normalized the function @xmath112 in such way that the energy of the nontopological solutions is proportional to the corresponding magnetic flux .",
    "the bps equations of the models here analyzed when @xmath113 reduce to exactly the equations ( [ e2x ] ) . in this field regimen the solutions are exact and given by eqs .",
    "( [ ag ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) . these equations and their solutions",
    "are invariant under the following scaling transformation,@xmath114with @xmath115 the transformation parameter .",
    "such an invariance enhances the solutions of the models because there must exist a free parameter defining a family of infinite solutions . in @xmath116-models defined in @xmath117-dimensions",
    "the @xmath45  coupling constant is dimensionless .",
    "thus it becomes a free parameter characterizing the solutions .",
    "for example , @xmath45 determines the behavior of the solutions of ( [ e2x ] ) given by eqs .",
    "( [ ag ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) when @xmath113 .",
    "this way , when @xmath71 : @xmath118 and for @xmath72 : @xmath119    an important result is that for fixed @xmath45 and @xmath68 , we can determine the values of @xmath120  for which exist nontopological bps vortices , as given by eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) .",
    "in fact , we have verified that the winding number values are limited by the condition @xmath88 . despite this inequality ( [ ln ] ) is exact only for the solution of the set of bps equations ( [ e2x ] ) and it gives an upper - bound for the values of @xmath67 in all models we have considered .",
    "an other interesting issue concerns the search for bps solutions in generalized born - infeld - higgs models .",
    "this issue is now under consideration , and we expect interesting results for a future contribution .",
