    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are promising potential sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "they sporadically emit brief ( @xmath2s ) intense bursts of soft gamma - rays with peak luminosities commonly up to @xmath3 erg / s .",
    "three of the five known galactic sgrs have produced rare `` giant flare '' events with initial bright , short ( @xmath4s ) pulses followed by tails lasting minutes , with peak luminosities between @xmath5 and @xmath6erg / s . according to the `` magnetar '' model sgrs are neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields @xmath7g@xcite .",
    "bursts may result from the interaction of the star s magnetic field with its solid crust , leading to crustal deformations and occasional catastrophic cracking@xcite with subsequent excitation of nonradial star modes@xcite and the emission of gws@xcite . for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "the ligo scientific collaboration recently completed a search for transient gravitational waves associated with almost 200 individual electromagnetic sgr triggers@xcite . that search did not detect gw , but it explicitly targeted neutron star @xmath8-modes , placed the most stringent upper limits on transient gravitational wave amplitudes at the time it was published , and set isotropic emission energy upper limits that fell within the theoretically predicted range of some sgr models@xcite .",
    "in this paper we extend that work and describe a new electromagnetically triggered search method for gravitational waves from multiple sgr bursts . triggered gravitational wave searches assume that gravitational waves associated with an electromagnetic astrophysical event would reach earth at approximately the same time as light from the event .",
    "in addition , source sky location is also known .",
    "knowledge of time and sky position can be a great advantage to gravitational wave searches  @xcite .",
    "it allows us to calculate the detector response functions , allowing us to estimate more relevant upper limits on gw emission using simulated signals from the source .",
    "also , upper limits are typically lower than for untriggered all - sky searches , largely because they are more robust to loud glitches .",
    "finally , searches can target known astrophysical events .",
    "if the distance to the source is known , results can be given in terms of isotropic gravitational wave energy emitted from the source instead of strain amplitude at the detector .",
    "this ties the search to the astrophysical source instead of the detector on earth .",
    "all of these advantages apply to searches for gravitational waves from sgr bursts .",
    "the new analysis method described here , `` stack - a - flare , '' builds upon the analysis pipeline ( `` flare pipeline '' ) used in @xcite and described in @xcite by attempting to  stack \" potential gravitational wave signals from multiple sgr bursts . to stack @xmath1 bursts ,",
    "we first generate @xmath1 excess power time - frequency tilings . these are 2-dimensional matrices in time and frequency generated from the two detectors data streams .",
    "each tiling element gives an excess power estimate in the gw detector data stream in a small period of time @xmath9 and a small range of frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the time range of each tiling is chosen to be centered on the time of one of the target em bursts in the storm .",
    "we then align these @xmath1 tilings along the time dimension so that times of the target em bursts coincide , and perform a weighted addition according to a particular gw emission model .",
    "we hope to improve the search sensitivity by combining potential gravitational wave signals from separate bursts in an attempt to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , increasing the probability of detection and placing more stringent constraints on theoretical models via upper limits .",
    "we expect that this method would be suitable for performing searches using data from interferometric detectors such as ligo s , for gravitational waves associated with sgr storm events such as the 2006 march 29 sgr 1900 + 14 storm .",
    "figure[fig : lc_raw ] shows the storm light curve obtained by the bat detector aboard the swift satellite@xcite , and figure[fig : lc_stack ] illustrates the stacking procedure with the four most energetic bursts from the storm , showing the main search timescales .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section[section : stackstrategy ] we discuss the general strategy of multiple sgr burst searches . in section[section : stackmethod ] we describe two versions of the analysis method ( `` stack - a - flare '' ) , both of which are built upon the flare pipeline .",
    "one version coherently stacks gw time series associated with electromagnetic bursts in the storm , while the other stacks incoherently .",
    "we characterize the two versions using simulations in gaussian noise , demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of each and showing that relatively weak signals which could not be detected in the individual burst search can easily be detected with the new method .",
    "gains in gw energy sensitivity of @xmath0 are feasible with the incoherent version even in the presence of realistic relative timing uncertainties between sgr bursts , where @xmath1 is the number of stacked sgr bursts",
    ". finally , in section [ section : stacksim ] we examine the sgr 1900 + 14 storm light curve of figure[fig : lc_raw ] in detail and present estimated search sensitivities for a simulated search for gravitational waves from the storm , for two gw emission models :  fluence - weighted \" and  flat \" ( unweighted ) .",
    "before discussing stack - a - flare method implementation details , in this section we discuss the strategy of a generalized multiple sgr gw search . due to similarities between the individual burst and multiple burst searches in terms of astrophysics , goals , and implementation , the search choices will be similar to those followed in@xcite .",
    "as in the individual sgr search , multiple sgr searches could target neutron star fundamental mode ringdowns ( rds ) predicted in@xcite as well as unknown short - duration gw signals .",
    "the former are interesting targets because fundamental modes are the modes most efficiently damped by gw emission .",
    "the latter are interesting targets because the flare mechanism may involve some other violent motion inside the star , for example matter carried along with magnetic field lines as they rearrange themselves inside the crust .",
    "we assume that given a neutron star , @xmath11-mode frequencies and damping timescales would be similar from event to event , and that unknown signals would at least have similar central frequencies and durations from event to event .",
    "we thus focus on two distinct regions in the target signal time - frequency parameter space .",
    "the first region targets @xmath12(100 - 400)ms duration signals in the ( 13)khz band , which includes @xmath11-mode rd signals predicted in@xcite for ten realistic neutron star equations of state .",
    "we choose a search band of ( 13)khz for rd searches , with a 250ms time window which was found to give optimal search sensitivity@xcite .",
    "the second region targets @xmath12(5200)ms duration signals in the ( 1001000)hz band .",
    "the target durations are set by prompt sgr burst timescales ( 5ms to 200ms ) and the target frequencies are set by the detector s sensitive region .",
    "we search in two bands : ( 100200)hz ( probing the region in which the detectors are most sensitive ) and ( 1001000)hz ( for full spectral coverage below the rd search band ) using a 125ms time window . in all",
    ", we could search in three frequency bands .",
    "we could explore these areas in the parameter space using the same twelve simulated waveform types used for setting upper limits in the individual sgr burst search , described in@xcite : linearly and circularly polarized rds with @xmath13ms and frequencies in the range 13khz ; and band- and time - limited white noise bursts ( wnbs ) with durations of 11ms and 100ms and frequency bands matched to the two low frequency search bands .",
    "polarization angle will be chosen randomly for every compound injection in initial searches .",
    "it seems plausible to assume that , for a given neutron star , @xmath11-mode frequencies and damping timescales would be similar from event to event . for pure @xmath11-modes these quantities depend only on the global structure of the star , essentially the mean density  @xcite , and the magnetic corrections depend on integrals of the field over the entire stellar interior ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    "however , the major motivation for the low frequency unknown - waveform portion of the parameter space is stochastic gravitational wave emission arising from violent events in the neutron star crust .",
    "therefore , we will not assume similar waveforms from event to event in the unknown - waveform portion , although we will assume similar central frequencies and durations .              in a search",
    ", we divide the gw data into an on - source time region , in which gws associated with a given burst could be expected , and a background time region . on - source and background segments are analyzed identically resulting in lists of analysis events .    for the individual sgr search , trigger timing precision on the order of a second",
    "was handled with 4s on - source regions . for a multiple sgr search , significantly higher precision in _ relative _ trigger times between burst events in the stack will be required . however , a common bias in trigger times shared by all bursts in the stacking set ( _ absolute _ timing ) can be handled with an adequately large ( e.g. 4s ) on - source region .",
    "in general , imprecision in trigger times comes principally from two sources : satellite to geocenter light crossing delay and arbitrariness of the satellite trigger point in the light curve .",
    "it is possible to decrease both uncertainties through careful analysis of satellite data . if necessary , light crossing times at satellites can be propagated to the geocenter ( and subsequently to any given interferometer ) using the appropriate ephemeris .",
    "if satellite data is public , light curve analysis can yield a specific timing point , for example the start of the steep burst rise . increased absolute timing precision could allow us to use smaller on - source regions with durations set by theoretical predictions of time delay between electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission from sgr bursts .",
    "however , this could exclude astrophysical models with larger timing delays , for instance if the initial excitation transfers energy to the @xmath11-mode through some slow and inefficient mode - mode coupling due to selection rules . and",
    "it turns out there is little benefit to be gained : we have performed monte carlo simulations comparing @xmath14s and @xmath15s on - source regions . reducing the on - source region from 4s to 2s",
    "resulted in only a 2% reduction in amplitude upper limits , on average over 24 trials with various waveform types .",
    "we make one new assumption about the nature of individual bursts of gravitational waves from sgrs : that the time delay between each gamma - ray burst and the associated gw burst does not vary by more than about 100  ms , less than duration of the shortest coherently modeled signal and comparable to the star s",
    "alfvn crossing time . a variation this large would severely degrade detection efficiency in the case of 11ms duration wnbs , but",
    "as we shall see in section[section : sensitivityvstiming ] , detection of neutron star rds ( with @xmath16s ) remains robust .",
    "as with the individual burst search , the background region serves three purposes@xcite : iit is used to estimate statistics of the power tiling as a function of frequency for use in the flare pipeline ; iit provides false alarm rate ( far ) estimates from which the significance of the loudest on - source analysis event can be determined ; iit is representative noise into which simulated waveforms can be injected for estimating upper limits . in the course of validating the individual sgr search we showed that 1000s of data on either side of an on - source region produce sufficient estimates of the power tiling statistics@xcite . this requirement and the estimation procedure",
    "are unchanged in the multiple sgr search , so @xmath17s of data will again suffice for this purpose .",
    "the background region required for injecting simulations to estimate upper limits may depend on the system being modeled and the desired statistical precision ; for the mock sgr 1900 + 14 storm search we describe below , @xmath18s of background is sufficient .",
    "the background region required for far estimates depends on the desired precision of far estimates . estimating the far of a very large on - source analysis event requires a larger background than estimating the far of a small on - source analysis event , for a given level of precision .      in a multiple burst search",
    "we must choose which bursts to include in the set and how to weight them .",
    "since gw energy @xmath19 is unknown we are left to attempt to choose weightings via other observables which we hope will correlate to it . as with the individual burst search",
    ", we assume that the sgr burst sample is comprised of bursts occurring within some specified time range defined by the observatory s science run schedule , and not necessarily from the same sgr source",
    ". we will refer to a set of sgr bursts to be included in the multiple burst search , along with a weighting strategy , as a gw emission model",
    ".    we could use occam s razor to select gw emission models such as the following :    iflat model  use every detected and confirmed burst from a given sgr source within the time range , with equal weighting . in practice we need to choose a cutoff on which bursts to include ; iinclusive model  use every detected and confirmed burst within the time range , from any sgr source , with equal weighting ; ifluence - weighted model  use every detected and confirmed burst from a given sgr source within the time range , weighted proportional to fluence ; iuse a subset of component bursts from a multi - episodic burst event such as the sgr 1900 + 14 storm , with some weighting scheme .",
    "we note that the inclusive model s2 could benefit from a search method that was insensitive to variations between sgr sources .",
    "for example , we would expect two different sources to have @xmath11-modes at different frequencies , which may not brighten corresponding pixels in a time - frequency tiling .",
    "we do not attempt to solve this problem here .",
    "we can also imagine stacking gw emission models based on specific theoretical models .",
    "a theory may predict that there is no correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "such a prediction corresponds to the flat model and is tested below . or a theory may predict that there is one emission mechanism with a constant mechanical efficiency , and thus @xmath20 is always proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "this is treated in the fluence - weighted model and tested below .",
    "a theory may predict that @xmath19 is some more complicated function of @xmath20 , the simplest example being a step function  for instance , a theory that small flares originate from magnetic reconnections far out in the magnetosphere and only large flares from reconnections in or near the star itself  @xcite .",
    "however the swift / bat spectra of the sgr  1900 + 14 storm indicate that the neutron star surface participates in all flares  @xcite , and therefore we do not address such a model below ( although it might be interesting at a later date ) .",
    "a theory may also predict that the time delay between electromagnetic and gravitational emission varies from burst to burst .",
    "some variation , up to the target signal durations of tens or hundreds of milliseconds , is accounted for in the searches described below .",
    "larger variations could potentially be treated by sweeping over some range of time delays for each burst , a more complicated search which we do not yet address .",
    "we will neglect for the time being complicating factors such as : multiple injections of energy into a single burst , with possible correlation in gravitational wave emission energy ; qualitatively different gravitational wave emission in the case of intermediate flares and common bursts ; and beaming issues .",
    "we also neglect other possibilities such as correlating @xmath19 with flare peak luminosities or rise times .",
    "both versions of the stack - a - flare pipeline , `` t - stack '' and `` p - stack , '' consist of an extension to the flare pipeline@xcite , a simple but effective search pipeline based on the excess power detection statistic of  @xcite .",
    "the flare pipeline can process streams of data from either one or two gw detectors .",
    "first data is conditioned , then excess power tilings are created , and finally analysis events are constructed via clustering elements in the tilings .    data conditioning consists of zero - phase digital filtering in the time domain  @xcite , first with a bandpass filter and then with a composite notch filter .",
    "the raw calibrated ligo power spectrum is colored , and is characterized by a sensitive region between @xmath1260  hz to @xmath122  khz which includes a forest of narrow lines , with increasingly loud noise on either side of the sensitive band .",
    "search sensitivity is increased by removing these insensitive regions from the data , which would otherwise dominate weak signals and destroy bandwidth after transformation to frequency domain .",
    "we remove narrow lines associated with the power line harmonics at multiples of 60  hz , the violin modes of the mirror suspension wires , calibration lines , and persistent narrow band noise sources of unknown origin .",
    "time - frequency spectrograms are then created from conditioned data for individual detectors from a series of blackman - windowed discrete fourier transforms , of time length @xmath9 set by the target signal duration .",
    "tile _ is an estimate of the short - time fourier transform of the data at a specific time and frequency .",
    "each column in the tiling corresponds to a time bin of width @xmath9 and each row corresponds to a frequency bin of width @xmath10 , both linearly spaced , with @xmath21 .",
    "adjacent time bins overlap by @xmath22 to guard against mismatch between prospective signals and tiling time bins .",
    "larger overlaps require more computation and do not noticeably improve sensitivity@xcite .    in a one - detector search",
    ", we then have a complex - valued time - frequency tiling from which we calculate the real - valued one - sided psd for every time bin .",
    "to do this we multiply each tile value by its complex conjugate and normalize the result to account for sampling frequency and windowing function .",
    "we discard frequency bins outside of the chosen search band .    in a two - detector search , we have two complex time - frequency tilings ( one for each detector ) from which we calculate p^(12)_tf = where @xmath23 represents a tiling matrix and @xmath24 and @xmath11 are time and frequency bin indices , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the detector . here @xmath27 is the gravitational wave crossing time difference between detectors ; this term takes care of applying the appropriate time difference between detector data streams in the fourier space , with the advantage of permitting sub - sample time delays , which significantly increases the sensitivity at higher frequencies .",
    "the real part is kept , and normalization is applied as in the one - detector case . to obtain a positive - definite statistic we take the absolute value of each tile ; this allows sensitivity to both strongly correlated and strongly anti - correlated signals in the two ( potentially misaligned ) detectors .",
    "next , we use off - source data to remove the background noise power from each element of the psd time - frequency tiling .",
    "the elements are fit to a gamma distribution@xcite , and outliers above a threshold ( typically four standard deviations ) are discarded . the resulting estimate on the mean",
    "is subtracted from each element of the corresponding frequency bin in the psd matrix , giving a matrix of excess power ( or `` cross excess power '' in the two - detector case ) .    to create analysis events we use a simple 2-dimensional clustering algorithm , allowing retention of signal energy which might otherwise be fragmented in the case of extended signals in the time - frequency plane .",
    "analysis events correspond to discrete clusters found by the algorithm , and include information on cluster central frequency , central time , bandwidth , duration , and so forth .",
    "the detection statistic ( event loudness ) is the sum over the cluster of tile significance .",
    "the t - stack pipeline combines burst events in the time domain .    for each of @xmath1 burst events a trigger time",
    "is determined . for a given gw detector ,",
    "@xmath1 time series segments containing those trigger times are then aligned to the trigger times , weighted according to antenna factor , and added together . the resulting summed time series ( either one or two , depending on how many detectors are included in the search )",
    "are then fed to the flare pipeline .",
    "as will be described below , the t - stack pipeline has the advantage of achieving higher sensitivity in gaussian noise , but the disadvantage of being extremely sensitive to timing inaccuracies and variations in gw signal waveform from burst to burst .",
    "this makes it a potentially viable choice for analyzing multi - episodic events  in which a single contiguous 100@xmath28s - binned light curve might provide adequate timing precision  but a poor choice for analyzing isolated burst events or incoherent signals such as band - limited wnbs .",
    "the p - stack pipeline combines burst events in the frequency domain .",
    "we determine a trigger time for each of @xmath1 burst events based on gamma - ray data .",
    "each of @xmath1 time series containing those triggers is processed with the flare pipeline , up to the clustering algorithm , exactly as in an individual sgr burst search .",
    "antenna factors are applied at this time .",
    "the result is @xmath1 time - frequency significance tilings , with different noise but hopefully with similar or identical signals .",
    "the @xmath1 significance tilings are then aligned to the trigger time and added together .",
    "the combined significance tiling is then fed through the flare pipeline clustering algorithm with a fixed fraction of tiles to include in the clustering ( e.g. 0.1% ) .",
    "a fixed fraction of tiles is used instead of a fixed loudness threshold value because the variance of the tile loudness distribution at a given frequency increases with @xmath1 .    as will be described below",
    ", the p - stack pipeline has the advantage of being relatively insensitive to timing inaccuracies or differences in waveform from burst to burst , but it has less sensitivity than the t - stack pipeline for the ( possibly unrealistic ) precisely - known timing case , with deterministic waveforms .          .",
    "this example curve was made with the t - stack pipeline using compound injections of @xmath29 1590hz circularly polarized ringdowns injected into gaussian noise with @xmath30 .",
    "each efficiency curve was constructed using 20 amplitude scaling factors and 20 trials at each @xmath31 amplitude .",

    "we characterized 1090hz @xmath13ms and 2590hz @xmath13ms circularly polarized ringdowns , corresponding to the low and high frequency ranges in the signal parameter space .",
    "timing errors were randomly chosen for each ringdown from a normal distribution with @xmath55 ranging from 10@xmath69s to 100ms , and were applied as a timing shift to the given ringdown . at each timing uncertainty",
    "we constructed efficiency curves using 20 amplitude scaling factors and 20 trials at each @xmath31 amplitude .",

    "as expected , the p - stack method is independent of timing error , up until large timing errors on the order of the signal duration .",

    "we envision four possible types of stacked sgr searches : ihigh frequency ( 10003000hz ) searches for ringdown burst emission , for single sgr storm events ( ringdown upper limits ) ; ilow frequency ( 1001000hz ) searches for stochastic burst emission , for single sgr storm events ( band- and time - limited wnb upper limits ) ; ihigh frequency ( 10003000hz ) searches for ringdown burst emission , for isolated , time - separated sgr bursts ( ringdown upper limits ) ; ilow frequency ( 1001000hz ) searches for stochastic burst emission , for isolated , time - separated sgr bursts ( band- and time - limited wnb upper limits ) .",
    "we distinguish storm events from isolated events because it is much easier to get precise relative times for storm events .",
    "we have found that the p - stack pipeline should be effective in any of these cases , with an energy sensitivity gain over the individual burst search of approximately @xmath0 .",
    "the t - stack pipeline shows an energy sensitivity improvement of approximately @xmath1 , but only if the target signals are coherent , and only if the relative timing between sgr gw burst events can be known to high precision ( @xmath74100@xmath69s at 1090hz and @xmath7450@xmath69s at 2590hz ) . as we will see , this timing precision requirement is stringent . in the future",
    "we might search for a method of overcoming the t - stack timing precision limitation , possibly by using additional computational resources to perform time shifts between the time series in the stack .",
    "in this section we describe a mock stacking search with the p - stack pipeline , using simulated ligo data , for gw associated with the 2006 march 29 sgr 1900 + 14 storm event .",
    "we first describe a procedure for estimating burst start times and fluences from the light curve .",
    "we then discuss gw emission models .",
    "we finally present sensitivity estimates .",
    "data from the bat detector on the swift satellite are publicly available . in figure[fig : lc_raw ] , we show the storm light curve in photon counts in the 15100kev band with 1ms time bins .",
    "sgr bursts lasting longer than 500ms are typically considered `` intermediate flares '' ; the storm contained both intermediate flares and common bursts .    before choosing gw emission models for stacking , we gathered information from the light curve , most importantly consistent relative burst times .",
    "though the bat timing resolution is 100@xmath69s , additional resolution would not improve our estimates of relative burst times as we shall see .",
    "we also measured integrated counts under each burst , a quantity roughly proportional to fluence .",
