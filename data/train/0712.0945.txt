    "measurements in the field of charmed hadrons experience a revival in the recent years .",
    "the reason for an increased interest is twofold : the b - factories provide for an abundant source of charmed hadrons .",
    "the integrated luminosity @xmath7 fb@xmath5 of the kekb collider @xcite corresponds to a production of around @xmath8 charmed hadron pairs in a clean environment of @xmath6 collisions .",
    "secondly , a dual role of charm physics is exploited : as an experimental test ground for different theoretical predictions , most notably the lattice qcd , enabling in turn a more precise determinations of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements ; and as a standalone field of various standard model ( sm ) tests and searches of new physics ( np ) phenomena .",
    "search for the @xmath0 mixing ( a quest started soon after the discovery of @xmath9mesons in 1976 @xcite ) belongs to the latter category .",
    "it is governed by the lifetime of @xmath2 mesons , @xmath10 , and by the mixing parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the masses and widths of the mass eigenstates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , @xmath17 @xmath18 is the average decay width .",
    "the mixing rate is severely suppressed due to the small su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking ( @xmath19 ) and smallness of the @xmath20 ckm matrix element @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the effective @xmath21 hamiltonian ( i.e. contribution of the box diagram , providing a satisfactory description of mixing in the systems of @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons ) yield a negligible mixing parameter magnitude @xmath24 .",
    "long distance contributions to the @xmath9- @xmath25   transitions are difficult to calculate .",
    "approaches based on the operator product expansion @xcite or summation over exclusive intermediate states , accessible to both @xmath9 and @xmath25  @xcite , result in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .     and product of ckm matrix elements in model including the fourth generation down - like quark @xmath28 @xcite.,width=226 ]    regardless of large uncertainties of the predictions , the sm probability of @xmath9 meson to oscillate into its antiparticle before decaying , @xmath29 , is small , at most of the order @xmath30 .",
    "new as - yet - unobserved particles could contribute to the loop diagrams and thus significantly increase the value of @xmath31 .",
    "a limit of @xmath32 would put significant constraints on the parameter space of large number of np models @xcite . as an example",
    "a possibility of the fourth family of fermions , including a down - like @xmath33 quark of mass @xmath34 , may be considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "an experimental value of @xmath35 would constrain the ckm matrix elements product @xmath36 for @xmath37  gev / c@xmath38 , a limit much more stringent than the one following from the current ckm matrix unitarity requirement .",
    "similar parameter constraints can be put to 17 out of 21 np models considered in @xcite . the width difference ( @xmath39 ) , on the other hand , is governed by @xmath2 decays into physical states , where no significant deviations from the sm have been observed up to date .",
    "however , @xmath39 is known to vanish in the limit of exact su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "hence np contributions not vanishing in this limit could affect the value of @xmath39 regardless of their small contribution to the decay amplitudes @xcite .    beside the possible effects on the mixing parameters , np could produce a sizable violation of the @xmath1 symmetry ( @xmath40 ) in @xmath2 meson decays @xcite . within the sm",
    "the @xmath40 is expected to be small .",
    "of the three types of the @xmath1 violation , @xmath40 in decays , @xmath40 in mixing and in the interference between mixing and decays , the first one is expected to be present only in the singly cabibbo suppressed decays . to these , beside the tree amplitude also penguin diagrams ( @xmath41 ) can contribute , and the existence of at least two amplitudes of different strong and weak phase is a necessary condition for this type of violation to occur @xcite .",
    "the weak phase difference between the two amplitudes is @xmath42 , which represents a rough estimate of the expected @xmath40 effect @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries due to @xmath40 in mixing and interference can be expressed as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , where @xmath45 is the weak phase between the mixing and decay amplitudes .",
    "hence the magnitude of these types of @xmath40 is even smaller .",
    "observation of the @xmath1 violation an order of magnitude larger than these expectation would clearly point to the intervention of np .",
    "the presented studies were carried out by the belle detector , a general purpose full solid - angle spectrometer @xcite operating at the asymmetric @xmath6 kekb collider @xcite .",
    "the center - of - mass ( cms ) energy of the collisions corresponds to the mass of the @xmath46 , decaying to a pair of @xmath47 mesons .",
    "in addition to the @xmath48 production , the cross section for the continuum production of @xmath49 and @xmath50 quark pairs through a virtual photon exchange at this energy is several times larger . in the presented measurements",
    "the @xmath9 mesons produced in @xmath51 are reconstructed .",
    "two main features of the detector are exploited for this purpose .",
    "the identification of detected charged tracks is performed using a combined information from several detector sub - modules @xcite .",
    "an illustration of the performance can be given by the efficiency for the charged kaon identification , @xmath52 , with the @xmath53 misidentification rate @xmath54 for tracks with momenta between 1  gev/@xmath50 and 3.5  gev/@xmath50 .",
    "a silicon vertex detector enables a precise determination of the decay time @xmath55 of short - lived particles . for @xmath56 decays",
    ", the distribution of estimated uncertainties on @xmath55 peaks at around @xmath57 and has an average of @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left @xcite ) ; @xmath59 is the world average value of the @xmath9 lifetime @xcite .     in @xmath56 decays .",

    "there is a long list of measurements devoted to the @xmath9- @xmath25   mixing from the belle collaboration .",
    "both , semileptonic @xcite and hadronic decays @xcite have been exploited in the past .",
    "the most sensitive recent measurements , using decays to a @xmath1 eigenstate ( @xmath62 , with @xmath63 ) @xcite and to a self - conjugate final state ( @xmath64 ) @xcite , are presented in this paper .",
    "there are several methods and selection criteria in common to the presented measurements . in order to search for events where a @xmath9 undergoes a transition to @xmath65 the flavor of the initially produced neutral meson",
    "must be tagged .",
    "this is achieved by reconstruction of decays @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "the charge of the characteristic low momentum pion @xmath68 tags the flavor of the initially produced @xmath2 meson .",
    "the energy released in the @xmath69 decay , @xmath70 has a narrow peak for the signal events and thus helps in rejecting the combinatorial background . here",
    ", @xmath71 is used to denote the invariant mass of the @xmath72 decay products , and @xmath73 for the nominal mass of @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath9 mesons produced in @xmath47 decays have different decay time distribution and kinematic properties than the mesons produced in continuum . in order to obtain a sample of neutral mesons with uniform properties we require the momentum of the reconstructed @xmath69 mesons in the cms to be larger than 2.5  gev / c@xmath38 .",
    "since the momentum of @xmath69 in @xmath74 is kinematically constrained , this requirement completely rejects the @xmath9 s from the latter source .",
    "last but not least , the selection criteria are optimized using the mc simulation , in order not to bias the results of the measurements .      in the limit of no @xmath40",
    "the mass eigenstates of neutral charmed mesons , with distinct values of lifetime @xmath76 , are also @xmath1 eigenstates .",
    "hence only the mass eigenstate component of @xmath9 with the @xmath1 eigenvalue equal to the one of @xmath77 contributes to @xmath62 decays . by measuring the lifetime of @xmath9 in decays to @xmath77 one determines the corresponding @xmath78 or @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "both @xmath1 states contribute in decays to non-@xmath1 final states , like @xmath80 .",
    "the measured value of the effective lifetime in the latter process corresponds to a mixture of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . by explicit writing of decay time rates in the presence of oscillations , and taking into account @xmath81 ,",
    "one derives a relation between lifetimes as measured in @xmath62 and in decays to a mixed @xmath1 final state to be @xcite @xmath82 with @xmath83 denoting the @xmath1 eigenvalue of @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath59 represents the effective @xmath9 lifetime as measured in decays to non-@xmath1 eigenstates ( @xmath84 ) and the relative difference of the lifetimes is described by the parameter @xmath85 .",
    "the final states @xmath86 are @xmath1 eigenstates with @xmath87 .",
    "the ratio of lifetimes measured in these decays and in the @xmath56 yields the value of @xmath85 : @xmath88 expressed in terms of the mixing parameters , @xmath85 reads @xcite @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 describing the @xmath40 in mixing and interference between mixing and decays , respectively .",
    "if for the moment the possibility of @xmath40 is neglected ( @xmath92 ; search for the @xmath40 is described separately in a later section ) , one notes that @xmath93 .",
    "the described method of @xmath85 determination has been exploited in @xcite .",
    "selection of the @xmath9 candidate decays is based on @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 is the decay channel dependent resolution ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "distributions of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the signal yields and purities of selected @xmath77 and @xmath80 samples , following from the fit to the tuned simulated samples , are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the amount of background in all three reconstructed channels is low .",
    "the expected sensitivities can be compared to expectations from the lhcb experiment scheduled to start data taking in the coming year . with @xmath104  fb@xmath5 ( expected to be collected in around 5 years of running at the nominal luminosity )",
    "one hopes for @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "these estimates can be roughly placed in between @xmath108  ab@xmath5 and @xmath109  ab@xmath5 expectations from the super - b factory .",
    "considering the results presented in this and other charm mixing related papers submitted to the conference , it is fair to say that the year 2007 ( 31 years after the @xmath9 meson discovery ) was the year of experimental confirmation of the @xmath9 mixing ( to be compared to the time span of 6 years between similar observations in @xmath110 system , 4 years in @xmath111 system and 14 years in the case of @xmath23 mesons ) . at the moment we are facing a somewhat rare situation of experimental evidence without an accurate theoretical guidance on whether the phenomenon is entirely due to the sm physics or not .",
    "the largest interest determining the work ahead lies in a precise determination of @xmath112 and search for the @xmath1 violation in the charm sector . for",
    "it is in this field of measurements where we can expect an answer to the above question .",
    "observation of @xmath40 effects at the existing facilities would be a sign of np .",
    "a proposed super - b factory would enable searches for the @xmath1 asymmetries to the @xmath113 level , a range covered by the current sm expectations and thus an interesting area of search for np to appear .",
