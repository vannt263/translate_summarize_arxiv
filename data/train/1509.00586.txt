    "<S> quantum sensors based on solid - state spins provide tremendous opportunities in a wide range of fields from basic physics and chemistry to biomedical imaging . however , integrating them into a scanning probe microscope to enable practical , nanoscale quantum imaging is a highly challenging task . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the use of single spins in diamond in conjunction with atomic force microscopy techniques has allowed significant progress towards this goal , but generalisation of this approach has so far been impeded by long acquisition times or by the absence of simultaneous topographic information . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on a scanning quantum probe microscope which solves both issues , by employing a nano - spin ensemble hosted in a nanodiamond . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides up to an order of magnitude gain in acquisition time , whilst preserving sub-100 nm spatial resolution both for the quantum sensor and topographic images . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate two applications of this microscope . </S>",
    "<S> we first image nanoscale clusters of maghemite particles through both spin resonance spectroscopy and spin relaxometry , under ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> our images reveal fast magnetic field fluctuations in addition to a static component , indicating the presence of both superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> we next demonstrate a new imaging modality where the nano - spin ensemble is used as a thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> we use this technique to map the photo - induced heating generated by laser irradiation of a single gold nanoparticle in a fluid environment . </S>",
    "<S> this work paves the way towards new applications of quantum probe microscopy such as thermal / magnetic imaging of operating microelectronic devices and magnetic detection of ion channels in cell membranes .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , quantum sensing has attracted increasing attention because it opens up the possibilities for non - invasive sensing with nanoscale mapping potential and single atom sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the model system for these studies has been the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centre in diamond , which has shown great promise as an atomic - sized sensor operating under ambient conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nv centre is a photostable point defect whose electronic ground state is a spin triplet that can be initialised and read out by optical means @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to detect the spin resonance of a single nv centre and coherently control its spin state . owing to interaction with the local environment , </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the spectral and temporal properties of an nv centre s spin provides access to a number of local properties , such as the magnetic field , electric field , pressure or temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , nv sensors are capable not only of measuring static fields but also fluctuating ones . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , allows retrieval of spectral information from a sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this capability was recently used to perform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a small ensemble of protons @xcite .        in order to obtain spatial information about the sample s properties , the nv probe must be scanned relative to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this is commonly achieved by using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) , which enables a probe to be scanned relative to a sample , while precisely controlling the probe - sample distance . integrating an nv probe into an afm </S>",
    "<S> can be achieved by grafting a nanodiamond onto the tip of the afm @xcite , or by fabricating an all - diamond afm tip hosting an nv centre @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative route is to make use of an nv centre located near the surface of a bulk diamond and to place the sample on the afm tip @xcite . of these various strategies , </S>",
    "<S> attachment of the nanodiamond to the afm tip is the only one which can provide the detailed topography of the sample in addition to quantum sensor information . </S>",
    "<S> this is a key requirement for a practical , versatile instrument capable of imaging complex samples such as assemblies of nanoparticles , nanostructured thin films or biological cells . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , most probe microscopy experiments to date have employed a single nv centre as the scanning probe , rather than an ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the fact that the ultimate spatial resolution is in principle given by the size of the probe volume , which is minimal for a single nv centre ( @xmath0 nm ) , although in practice the resolution is limited by the probe - sample distance , which is typically several tens of nm at least @xcite . with an ensemble of nv centres , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial resolution is degraded by spatial averaging over the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> however , the acquisition time is also dictated by the number @xmath1 of nv centres employed in the sensor , since this limits the signal - to - noise ratio which scales as @xmath2 @xcite . as a consequence , acquisition times up to several tens of hours per image are typically required with a single nv centre , which imposes serious technical constraints owing to mechanical and thermal drifts present in the microscope @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we seek to optimise the trade - off between acquisition time and resolution by employing a small nv ensemble as our probe . </S>",
    "<S> based on this idea , we demonstrate a scanning nano - spin ensemble microscope that is capable of providing simultaneous topographic and quantum sensor information with a spatial resolution better than 100 nm and typical acquisition times of an hour . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the versatility of our microscope by applying various sensing modes to two different samples . </S>",
    "<S> we first use spin resonance spectroscopy and spin relaxometry to image the magnetic properties of aggregates of maghemite nanoparticles ( fe@xmath3o@xmath4 in the cubic @xmath5 phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we demonstrate nanoscale thermal imaging of a photo - heated gold nanoparticle , through spin resonance spectroscopy of the quantum probe in a fluid environment . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that our approach , which relies on nanodiamonds containing a small ensemble of nv spins , is a promising avenue to realise a practical , versatile scanning quantum probe microscope .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental set - up is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> a nanodiamond hosting multiple nv centres is attached to the tip of an afm . </S>",
    "<S> a microscope objective lens placed below the sample , which sits on a thin transparent substrate , enables us to excite the nv centres and collect their fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a microwave antenna is fabricated on top of the substrate to allow the nv spin resonances to be driven . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum probes are type - ib nanodiamonds @xmath6 nm in diameter , containing @xmath7 nv centres per particle . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a collected fluorescence signal of up to @xmath8 photons per second ( see si ) and a gain in signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath9 over a single nv centre probe . by monitoring the fluorescence intensity while sweeping the microwave frequency , a spin resonance spectrum of the nv ensemble is obtained ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it generally exhibits two lines at frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 . by virtue of zeeman , </S>",
    "<S> stark and thermal expansion effects , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are well characterised functions of the local magnetic field @xmath12 @xcite , electric field @xmath13 @xcite and temperature @xmath14 @xcite . while spin resonance spectroscopy is sensitive only to the static component  or sub - khz variations  of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , methods have been developed to probe fast fluctuations of these quantities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods rely on quantum techniques to control and measure the spin dynamics of the nv centres , which are strongly dependent on fluctuations in the local environment . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c illustrates two examples of such measurements , performed on a nanodiamond attached to an afm tip , termed spin relaxation and spin decoherence measurements , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation time @xmath15 ( left - hand graph in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) is measured by applying laser pulses to initialise and subsequently read out the nv spin state after a wait time @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation rate @xmath17 can be written as the sum @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the intrinsic relaxation rate and @xmath20 is the relaxation caused by the fluctuations of the external magnetic field occurring at the spin resonance frequencies @xmath21 ghz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin coherence time @xmath22 ( right - hand graph in fig . [ fig1]c ) is measured by applying mw pulses according to a spin echo sequence . </S>",
    "<S> it is sensitive to slower magnetic field fluctuations , in the khz - mhz range @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will use spin resonance spectroscopy to image static magnetic and temperature fields , but also spin relaxometry to image fast magnetic fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> owing to the gain in the collected fluorescence signal of over two orders of magnitude compared to the case for a single nv centre probe , it is possible to conduct imaging experiments with greatly improved acquisition speed . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the use of nv quantum sensing to characterise the magnetic properties of individual magnetic nano - objects . as a demonstration experiment , we image and </S>",
    "<S> investigate the dynamics of small aggregates of maghemite ( @xmath5-fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ) nanoparticles . </S>",

    "<S> maghemite nanoparticles in particular exhibit a rich variety of tunable magnetic phenomena , ranging from superparamagnetism below a critical diameter ( @xmath23 nm at room temperature ) to ferromagnetism for bigger particles and even superferromagnetism for some ordered assemblies of particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains a challenge to study the magnetic properties of individual  or small clusters of  such nanoparticles , especially in their superparamagnetic phase @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> small aggregates of maghemite nanoparticles of diameter @xmath24 nm were prepared on a glass cover slip ( see si ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]a shows an afm image of the sample acquired with a nanodiamond on the tip , revealing aggregates of various sizes ranging from 50 nm to more than 500 nm , corresponding to @xmath25 particles per aggregate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the topographic image , the fluorescence signal from the nv ensemble is monitored under a given sequence of laser and microwave pulses , and analysed to form the corresponding nv sensor image . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , fig . </S>",

    "<S> the resonance frequencies are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the zero - field splitting parameters , @xmath41 ghz / t is the electron gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath42 is the magnetic field projection along the nv centre s symmetry axis . for an ensemble of nv centres , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral features are broadened because the probe experiences four different magnetic field projections at the same time corresponding to the four possible crystallographic axes , and due to variations in the zero - field splitting parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the width @xmath44 accounts for the averaging over the various orientations and positions of the nv centres contained in the nanodiamond , as well as over the vertical oscillation of the afm tip . </S>",
    "<S> we found these values to reach up to @xmath45 mt and @xmath46 mt . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the presence of maghemite nanoparticles in a ferromagnetic state , as expected for particles bigger than @xmath23 nm .    to probe the dynamics of the magnetisation , we measured the spin relaxation time of the nv ensemble . </S>",

    "<S> is governed by the local field fluctuations at the resonance frequencies of @xmath21 ghz , our observations suggest that the maghemite aggregates exhibit strong magnetisation fluctuations in the ghz range . assuming that the fluctuations of @xmath28 can be described by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process with a relaxation time @xmath53 specific to each particle , the induced relaxation rate is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the variance of the magnetic field amplitude averaged over the nv ensemble produced by the particles satisfying the resonance condition @xmath56 ( see si ) . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , for particles below a certain size , thermal fluctuations can overcome the energy barrier due to magnetic anisotropy , resulting in spontaneous reversals of the magnetisation direction . for uniaxial anisotropy , the superparamagnetic relaxation time is given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the anisotropy constant , @xmath61 the particle s volume , @xmath62 the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 the temperature . for maghemite particles , </S>",

    "<S> , this leads to @xmath67 s at room temperature , which is well within the sensitivity window of nv relaxometry as @xmath68 s. on the other hand , particles as large as 25 nm in diameter yield @xmath69 s , which correspond to the quasi - static , ferromagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> our images therefore suggest that most aggregates are comprised of both small superparamagnetic particles and larger ferromagnetic particles . </S>",

    "<S> the averaging width is 2 pixels . ]    </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of using a multiple - nv sensor is the decreased acquisition time due to increased collected photon signal . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic images shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c and [ fig2]e have been acquired with dwell times of 0.4 and 1 s per pixel , respectively , corresponding to a total frame time of 60 and 150 minutes . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to acquire the data in a single pass as in conventional afm imaging , as opposed to the significantly longer acquisition times typically needed in single nv imaging experiments @xcite , which require complex multi - pass procedures and re - alignment algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that although our nv ensemble has inferior features compared with a single nv centre in a high - purity bulk diamond ( e.g. , broadened resonance lines , shorter intrinsic relaxation time ) which reduces the sensitivity to _ small _ changes  i.e. , a resonance shift much smaller than the line width or a relative @xmath15 change much smaller than unity  , this does not affect the present experiments where _ large _ changes are observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our images fully benefit from the @xmath2 increase in signal - to - noise ratio . apart from the increased acquisition speed , a further important feature of our microscope </S>",
    "<S> is its spatial resolution . by imaging a cluster of a few ( @xmath23 ) maghemite nanoparticles , </S>",
    "<S> whose topography is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , the spatial resolution of the instrument can be estimated . figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b , [ fig3]c and [ fig3]d show the near - field optical , spin resonance shift and spin relaxation images , respectively , obtained with the same nanodiamond probe as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the total acquisition time was 8 minutes for figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b and [ fig3]c , and 42 minutes for fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> again , a fast magnetic fluctuation component is observed ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d ) , while the static field seems comparatively weaker ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) </S>",
    "<S> . detailed analysis of the signal strength confirms that this aggregate is mainly composed of superparamagnetic particles ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> a line cut across the aggregate is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]e . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals a feature in the relaxation data as small as 60 nm ( full width at half maximum ) . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial resolution is limited by the effective probe volume , which is given by the size of the nanodiamond ( @xmath6 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the magnetic signal is largest on the sides of the aggregate . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the afm tip has a small vertical oscillation , therefore the effective probe - sample distance is larger when the tip is above the particles  hence a smaller mean magnetic field  than when it is positioned at the side of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is attributed to the non - spherical shape of the nanodiamond .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum sensing based on nv centres in diamond is not limited to the measurement of magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been shown that the nv spin can be used as a sensitive thermometer by relying on the temperature dependence of the crystal field splitting parameter @xmath39 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we extend this work and demonstrate the concept of nanoscale temperature mapping . as a test sample , </S>",
    "<S> we use gold nanoparticles of diameter @xmath70 nm , which exhibit a surface plasmon resonance at around 530 nm ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the particles can therefore be efficiently heated using the same laser as that used to excite the nv centres . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the gold nanoparticles act as nanoscale heat sources . </S>",
    "<S> a sample was prepared by spin coating gold nanoparticles onto a glass cover slip ( see si ) . because the glass substrate has a thermal conductivity much greater than that of air , any heat generated by illumination of the gold particle in air </S>",
    "<S> would be expected to spread preferentially towards the substrate , resulting in a negligible change in the air temperature above the particle . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in order to probe this photo - induced heating , the nanodiamond probe and the sample were immersed in water , as schematically shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the heat spreads quasi - isotropically around the particle , enabling the nanodiamond sensor to report the local temperature change .        in order to locate a gold particle and </S>",
    "<S> scan the region around it with the nanodiamond probe tip , we relied on the collected fluorescence rather than on the topography . </S>",
    "<S> the gold particles produce a weak but measurable fluorescence signal , which is maximised when the nanodiamond is directly above the particle as the laser beam is always focused on the nanodiamond ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b shows a fluorescence image obtained by scanning the nanodiamond around a 40-nm - diameter gold particle ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluorescent spot corresponds to the gold particle and indicates a significant absorption of the laser light , which is expected to turn primarily into heat . to form a temperature map , </S>",
    "<S> a full spin resonance spectrum is recorded at each pixel of the scan . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is acquired under continuous laser excitation , with an incident power of 250 @xmath71w , in order to maximise the heating . from the fits to the spectroscopy data , we then infer the splitting parameter @xmath39 and deduce the temperature increase @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the temperature measured in the absence of laser heating ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting temperature map is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals a region of increased temperature up to @xmath74 k , which is spatially correlated with the fluorescence spot ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> individual spectra corresponding to a few selected pixels are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d . </S>",
    "<S> a negative shift of the resonance frequencies is clearly observed at the hot spot . </S>",
    "<S> a line cut across the particle extracted from the temperature map is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]e ( red data ) , indicating a peak of full width at half maximum @xmath75 nm . also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]e is a line cut taken far from the particle ( blue data ) . </S>",
    "<S> a small amount of background heating of @xmath76 k is evident , suggesting that the nanodiamond is heated by the laser even in the absence of the gold particle , most likely through heating of the silicon afm tip . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the increase in fluorescence signal caused by the use of an nv ensemble is crucial to this particular experiment . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the signal from a single nv centre would be overwhelmed by the background fluorescence produced by the gold particle , making the measurement highly challenging using the conventional single nv approach .    </S>",
    "<S> to gain more insight into the heating of the gold particle , we derived an analytical expression for the nanodiamond temperature @xmath77 as a function of the relative position @xmath78 of the gold particle ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature increase of the gold particle is denoted @xmath79 and is assumed to be proportional to the laser intensity at position @xmath78 , while the temperature distribution outside the gold particle is obtained from the thermal diffusion equation in the steady - state regime , assuming for simplicity a spherical particle in a homogeneous medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the temperature of the gold particle when it is in the centre of the laser beam ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 nm is the laser beam width , @xmath84 nm is the gold particle radius , and @xmath85 is the centre - to - centre distance between the gold particle and the nanodiamond probe at @xmath82 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> fitting eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqtd ] ) to the data gives @xmath86 nm , consistent with the known sizes of the gold and diamond particles ( radius of 20 and 50 nm , respectively ) , and @xmath87 k ( fig . [ fig4]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature increase can be compared to the theoretical value @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the absorbed power , which applies to the case of an isolated particle in a homogeneous medium of thermal conductivity @xmath90 . using the bulk thermal conductivity of glass @xmath91 w@xmath92m@xmath93k@xmath94 and a power @xmath95w calculated from mie scattering theory @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> one predicts @xmath96 k. this is smaller than the value of 110 k inferred from the experiment , suggesting there may be enhanced absorption by the gold nanoparticle in the experiment due to , e.g. , a non - spherical particle shape or tip - induced field concentration effects . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these data illustrate that our technique can be used to investigate and measure nanoscale heating and thermal gradients induced by light , chemical reactions or other energy dissipation sources . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqtd ] ) shows that the linewidth of 180 nm is a convolution of both the temperature profile above the gold particle at a given position of the laser beam and the profile of the stimulating laser beam itself . </S>",
    "<S> this width is therefore related to the measurement conditions rather than to the intrinsic spatial resolution , which is limited only by the probe volume of @xmath97 nm corresponding to the nanodiamond size . </S>",
    "<S> we note that direct mapping of the temperature profile during constant heating could be achieved by employing an additional heating laser , thereby providing a way to investigate photo - induced heating with a spatial resolution drastically better than the current , diffraction - limited techniques @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a new approach to scanning quantum probe microscopy that relies on a spin ensemble in a nanodiamond . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to conventional afm topography , our microscope is capable of providing spin resonance and spin relaxation images with typical acquisition times of an hour . </S>",
    "<S> our instrument is capable of imaging both the static and fluctuating magnetic fields generated by small aggregates of maghemite nanoparticles , enabling detection of both ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> the nano - spin ensemble is also shown to be a sensitive nanoscale thermometer providing detailed temperature maps of photo - heated gold particles .    the present approach and experimental apparatus is particularly suited to the study of biological samples for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , scanning nanodiamond microscopy is compatible with operation in water , which paves the way to imaging experiments on living samples in their native environment . </S>",
    "<S> second , the use of multiple nv centres provides a significant gain in acquisition speed , which is a clear advantage for fragile samples that can not tolerate long acquisition times . in the experiments reported here the nanodiamond contained @xmath6 nv centres , but even higher concentration of nv centres could be used to further improve the scanning speed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , our instrument provides topographic images correlated to the quantum sensor images , with a combined spatial lateral resolution below 100 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this is a crucial requirement for experiments performed on samples with a non - trivial shape . </S>",
    "<S> we envisage using this technology to investigate spin signals in cell membranes stemming , e.g. , from spin labels @xcite or ion channels @xcite , which could give crucial insight into cell membrane functions and dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , scanning quantum probe microscopy also opens up opportunities for the study of solid - state samples . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the temperature mapping capability reported in this paper provides a new platform for studying thermal transfer at the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly relevant in the race towards ever smaller micro / nano - electronic devices , where the precise characterisation of heat transfer remains a fundamental bottleneck @xcite .      </S>",
