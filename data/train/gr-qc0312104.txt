    "non - trivial scalar field hair is possible if the scalar field potential is non - convex @xcite , although the hair is unstable @xcite . for conformally coupled scalar fields ,",
    "if the scalar field potential is zero or quadratic , then there are no non - trivial black hole solutions @xcite . however , in the presence of a quartic self - interaction potential there is an exact , closed - form solution for both charged and neutral black holes found recently by martinez , troncoso and zanelli @xcite , which we shall refer to hereafter as the mtz solution .",
    "this solution is the de sitter analogue of the bbmb solution , although the scalar field is regular on and outside the event horizon .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discover whether , like the bbmb solution , the mtz black hole is unstable .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : mtz ]",
    "we briefly review the neutral and electrically charged mtz solutions @xcite , whose stability is then studied using linear perturbation theory in sections [ sec : pertneut ] and [ sec : pertcharged ] respectively . in the appendix",
    "we outline the proof of a result needed for the stability analysis of the charged solutions .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the metric has signature @xmath0 and we use units in which @xmath1 throughout .",
    "we begin with the action for gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field with a quartic self - interaction potential and an electromagnetic field @xcite : @xmath2 ; \\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the coupling constant . for neutral black holes , the electromagnetic field is absent .",

    "the form of the scalar field is different for the electrically neutral and charged models . in the case with no electromagnetic field",
    ", there is a solution only if the coupling constant @xmath3 is given by @xmath15 and then the scalar field takes the form @xmath16 which has a pole at @xmath17 , lying inside the event horizon .    for charged black holes ,",
    "the only non - vanishing component of the electromagnetic field is @xmath18 where the charge - to - mass ratio is given by @xmath19 and the scalar field in this case is @xmath20 this latter solution only exists provided @xmath21 satisfies the bound @xmath22",
    "we now analyze the stability of the mtz black holes using linear perturbation theory .",
    "the electrically neutral and charged solutions need to be considered separately , and we begin with the neutral case since this is the simpler . in this and the following section , we consider only spherically symmetric perturbations since these are sufficient to show instability .",
    "many calculations were performed using the grtensorii @xcite routine @xcite .",
    "the perturbed spherically symmetric metric takes the form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a small parameter .",
    "the scalar field is perturbed as @xmath26 the ansatz ( [ eq : pmet]-[eq : pphi ] ) can then be substituted into the einstein and scalar field equations ( [ eq : eine ] ) and ( [ eq : sca ] ) , the equations then linearized and the metric perturbations @xmath27 and @xmath28 eliminated to yield a single perturbation equation for the perturbed scalar field @xmath29 .",
    "while this is possible in principle , in practice the algebra becomes somewhat unwieldy , even using a computer algebra package .",
    "we therefore employ a transformation to a simpler system which makes the calculations more tractable , and then substitute back the original perturbations . under the following conformal transformation @xcite ( see also @xcite for more details ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 the action ( [ eq : action ] ) becomes that of a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath32 with potential @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 at this stage we should comment that , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phineut ] ) , there is always a point ( @xmath36 ) between the event and cosmological horizons at which @xmath37 , and therefore the conformal transformation ( [ eq : cmet ] ) breaks down at this point .",
    "however , since this is only a single point , and not an open set , this does not render the theory completely ill - defined ( see , for example , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , the transformed variables have no physical significance ; the only purpose of the transformation is to simplify the algebra , in particular to derive the master perturbation equation , as in the analysis of ref .",
    "our conclusions will be drawn only once the perturbations of the original system have been substituted .",
    "the new metric ( [ eq : cmet ] ) takes the form @xcite : @xmath38 where we have transformed the radial coordinate by @xmath39 and the metric quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 are related to the original metric variables by @xcite : @xmath42 note that @xmath43 in the new metric . the transformed variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath32 are perturbed as follows : @xmath46 these expressions are substituted into the new einstein and scalar field equations ( a tilde denotes quantities calculated using the transformed metric ( [ eq : cmete ] ) ) : @xmath47 only terms linear in the parameter @xmath25 are retained , and the metric perturbations can then be eliminated .",
    "a single perturbation equation is then found for the variable @xmath29 . for periodic perturbations",
    "@xmath48 , this equation takes the form : @xmath49 where we have introduced the usual `` tortoise '' co - ordinate @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 so that @xmath52 and the region between the event and cosmological horizons @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 .",
    "the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the perturbation potential @xmath58 takes the form @xmath59 ; \\label{eq : neutpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 it should be stressed that the equation ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) could equally well have been derived directly , without using the conformal transformation ( [ eq : cmet ] ) , but that our method has simplified the algebra considerably .",
    "furthermore , the equation ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) holds everywhere , although the conformal transformation ( [ eq : cmet ] ) is defined only for those values of @xmath11 for which @xmath61 .",
    "the perturbation equation ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) has a regular singular point at @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "using the standard frobenius method , near this point @xmath29 behaves like @xmath64 \\label{eq : phibehav}\\ ] ] for constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the presence of the regular singular point means that it is not possible to define a non - singular transformation of ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) to standard schrdinger form , as , for example , was possible for three - dimensional black holes in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to cast the perturbation equation ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) into standard schrdinger form",
    ", we define a new perturbation variable @xmath67 as follows @xcite : @xmath68 so that the equation ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) then takes the form @xmath69 with potential @xmath58 given by ( [ eq : neutpot ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the quantity @xmath70 ( [ eq : aandb ] ) is regular and non - zero everywhere between the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "therefore , the potential ( [ eq : neutpot ] ) is regular for all @xmath50 apart from the second term , which has a double pole at @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 ) .",
    "near @xmath62 , the potential has the behaviour @xmath71 ^{2 } \\left ( r - r_{0 } \\right ) ^{-2 } + o\\left ( r - r_{0}\\right ) ^{-1};\\ ] ] and @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "the form of the potential is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot1 ] .     for the neutral mtz black holes .",
    "the potential has a double pole at @xmath62 .",
    "this is also the form of the potential for the charged mtz black holes configurations corresponding to points within the region @xmath74 , see section [ sec : pertcharged].,width=226 ]    like the original equation ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) , the new perturbation equation ( [ eq : psischro ] ) has a regular singular point at @xmath75 , and a frobenius expansion about this point gives the behaviour of @xmath67 to be @xmath76 , \\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are constants .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : phibehav ] ) , it can be seen that the transformation ( [ eq : psi ] ) yields precisely the correct behaviour for @xmath67 , so that the two perturbation equations ( [ eq : phiperteqn ] ) and ( [ eq : psischro ] ) are equivalent , in particular they have the same number of negative eigenvalues .",
    "using a standard result in quantum mechanics @xcite , potentials of this form have an infinite number of bound states corresponding to @xmath79 , that is , an infinite number of unstable modes .",
    "therefore we also have an infinite number of unstable modes of the original perturbations .",
    "this is the same behaviour as found for the bbmb black hole  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation analysis of the electrically charged black holes is considerably more complicated , and although we shall again make use of the conformal transformation ( [ eq : cmet ] ) to simplify the algebra , the untransformed perturbations themselves can be simplified first .    making a choice of gauge to set @xmath80 ,",
    "the gauge potential giving rise to the electromagnetic field is perturbed as below : @xmath81 so that the second of the maxwell equations ( [ eq : em ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "the metric and scalar field are perturbed in the same way as for the neutral black holes ( [ eq : pmet][eq : pphi ] ) .",
    "the @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 components of the einstein field equation ( [ eq : eine ] ) give @xmath86 and since we can remove an arbitrary constant from the gauge potential without changing the resulting electromagnetic field we can , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath87    the @xmath88 and @xmath11 components of the first maxwell equation ( [ eq : em ] ) then take the form : @xmath89 these two equations are compatible and can be integrated to give @xmath90 where we have absorbed the arbitrary constant of integration into the time co - ordinate .",
    "with the form of the electromagnetic potential now fixed , the @xmath91 component of the einstein equations can readily be integrated to yield @xmath92 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left(1-\\frac{1}{6}\\phi^{2}-\\frac{1}{6}r\\phi\\phi'\\right ) ^{-1 } ; \\label{eq : pnn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is an arbitrary function of @xmath11",
    ". incidentally , equation ( [ eq : pnn ] ) also holds for the neutral black holes .    at this point ,",
    "the perturbation equations are again too complicated to readily be simplified and we employ the conformal transformation as in the previous section . as in section",
    "[ sec : pertneut ] , we regard the transformation as a convenient algebraic tool with no physical significance @xcite .",
    "the transformations of the metric and scalar field are the same as before ( [ eq : cmet][eq : cphi ] ) , but now the electromagnetic field also transforms @xcite : @xmath94 leaving the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor invariant .",
    "the transformed metric variables and scalar field are perturbed in the same way as in the previous section .",
    "the only non - zero component of the transformed electromagnetic field is @xmath95 , which we write as @xmath96 where @xmath97    the electromagnetic and einstein equations can be used to find the following simple expressions for the perturbations of the transformed metric : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an arbitrary function of @xmath100 . with these expressions ,",
    "the @xmath101 component of the linearized einstein equation gives an equation of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are functions of @xmath100 only . using the equilibrium field equations , it can be shown that @xmath107 vanishes , and @xmath108 furthermore , it can be shown that @xmath109 by writing the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : res5 ] ) in terms of the original variables and radial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) can then be integrated to give @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "now , using the boundary conditions that @xmath112 at the event horizon , it must be the case that @xmath113 and so @xmath114 identically . using this result",
    ", the @xmath115 component of the linearized einstein equations reduces to a relationship between the electromagnetic field and scalar field perturbations : @xmath116    relations ( [ eq : metrels],[eq : res6 ] ) are sufficient to eliminate the metric and electromagnetic perturbations from the linearized scalar field equation . using the `` tortoise '' co - ordinate ( [ eq : tort1][eq : tort2 ] ) , and following the method of section [ sec : pertneut ] , we finally arrive at the schrdinger - like equation @xmath117 where @xmath67 is given by ( [ eq : psi ] ) and we are once again considering periodic perturbations .",
    "as might be expected , the potential @xmath118 is more complicated than for the neutral black holes : @xmath119 ; \\label{eq : chargedpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath120 and @xmath70 as before ( [ eq : aandb ] ) . as in the case of neutral black holes ,",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : sch ] ) with potential ( [ eq : chargedpot ] ) could have been derived directly without using the conformal transformation ( [ eq : cmet ] ) .",
    "however , our method has made the computations required significantly more tractable .",
    "the potential @xmath118 ( [ eq : chargedpot ] ) reduces , in the limit @xmath121 , to the potential @xmath58 for the neutral black holes .",
    "this is as expected , since in this limit the charge @xmath122 of the black hole tends to zero .",
    "it is again straightforward to show that @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath70 are all regular and non - zero everywhere between the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "however , unlike in the neutral case , for the charged mtz black holes it is no longer necessarily the case that @xmath120 vanishes for some @xmath11 lying between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "putting @xmath127 at @xmath75 in ( [ eq : scc ] ) and using the inequalities @xmath128 ; @xmath129 and @xmath130 , together with ( [ eq : hor ] ) , gives the condition that @xmath120 vanishes somewhere between the event and cosmological horizons if and only if @xmath131 when @xmath132 we have from ( [ eq : qm ] ) that @xmath133 and ( [ eq : ps ] ) becomes @xmath128 , which is always satisfied , retrieving the result of section [ sec : pertneut ] .",
    "similarly , in the limit @xmath134 , the inequality ( [ eq : ps ] ) is trivially satisfied for all @xmath135 , in accordance with the results for the bbmb black hole  @xcite .    if equation ( [ eq : ps ] ) is satisfied , then the second term in the potential @xmath118 ( [ eq : chargedpot ] ) has a double pole at @xmath75 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot1 ] for a typical potential in this case ) .",
    "although there are other terms in @xmath118 which have a single pole at @xmath75 , these will be sub - leading compared to the double pole . in this case the behaviour of @xmath118 near @xmath75 is the same as for the potential @xmath58  ( [ eq : neutpot ] ) : @xmath136 ^{2 }   \\left ( r - r_{0 } \\right ) ^{-2 } + o \\left ( r - r_{0 } \\right ) ^{-1 } .\\ ] ] as in the analysis of the neutral black holes , in this case standard results in quantum mechanics @xcite allow us to deduce that there are an infinite number of unstable modes .",
    "it remains therefore to understand whether the inequality ( [ eq : ps ] ) is satisfied by any or all of the charged mtz black hole solutions .",
    "we express this inequality in terms of the fractions of the maximum possible values of @xmath135 ( @xmath137 ) and @xmath122 ( @xmath138 ) for any particular value of @xmath139 , and denote these model parameters by @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively .",
    "the region @xmath74 of the @xmath142 phase space for which we have shown the solution to be unstable is then @xmath143 the region @xmath74 is shown in figure [ fig : region ] , where it can be seen that it makes up the vast majority of the available parameter space .",

    "[ fig : pot2 ] .     for charged mtz black hole configurations given by parameters @xmath142 lying outside the region @xmath74 .",
    "the potential is regular everywhere between the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "it is positive close to the event horizon , and then becomes negative .",
    "as the values of @xmath142 approach the boundary of the region @xmath74 , the positive peak close to the event horizon becomes larger and larger.,width=226 ]    the potential is regular everywhere between the event and cosmological horizons , where it vanishes .",

    "we show in the appendix that potentials of this form with @xmath144 must have at least one bound state , and therefore the corresponding black holes will be unstable .",
    "we have calculated numerically the integral on the left - hand - side of ( [ eq : intcond ] ) , and some typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : integral ] .     at points lying outside the region @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the charge is fixed to be 0.95 of the maximum charge , and the values of the mass vary from the value on the boundary of @xmath74 up to the maximum.,width=226 ]    we find that for most configurations outside @xmath74 , the integral ( [ eq : intcond ] ) is indeed negative , so that those black holes are unstable .",
    "however , for black hole configurations very close to the boundary of @xmath74 , we find that the integral becomes positive ( due to the large positive peak in the potential close to the event horizon ) .",
    "for such black holes their stability has to be investigated numerically , each configuration being considered separately . a simple way to check the existence of negative eigenvalues of ( [ eq : sch ] ) , without actually finding the values of these eigenvalues , is to apply continuity arguments of the type outlined in ref .",
    "if , for some @xmath79 ( which is not necessarily an eigenvalue of ( [ eq : sch ] ) ) , the solution of ( [ eq : sch ] ) satisfying the boundary conditions at , say , @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) has one zero before possibly diverging as @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , then there is at least one negative eigenvalue of ( [ eq : sch ] ) .",
    "we studied various black holes corresponding to points @xmath142 lying outside the region @xmath74 and such that the integral on the left - hand - side of ( [ eq : intcond ] ) is positive , and found , in each case , a value of @xmath79 satisfying this condition .",
    "therefore , for all the cases we studied , there are negative eigenvalues of ( [ eq : sch ] ) , showing instability .",
    "we have investigated the stability of the de sitter black hole solutions of einstein s equations due to martinez et al @xcite .",
    "the model contains a conformally coupled scalar field with a quartic self - interaction potential and also an electromagnetic field in the case that the black holes are charged .",
    "we have shown by analytic methods that all the neutral black holes are unstable , as are the charged black holes in the vast majority of the phase space . outside this region of phase space , we have used numerical methods to show that the black holes are unstable .",
    "the analysis differs from that for the analogous , asymptotically flat bbmb black holes , where the analytic approach suffices for both the neutral and all the charged configurations .",
    "however , the conclusions are the same , that the neutral and charged mtz black holes , like the bbmb black holes are unstable .",
