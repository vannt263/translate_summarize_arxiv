    "the hall effect is a fundamental transport property of metals and semiconductors",
    ". it can provide information on the carrier densities as well as on other interesting features of the electronic band structure . surprisingly and in spite of considerable work in the past , the hall coefficient ( @xmath0 ) of graphite , a highly anisotropic material composed by a stack of graphene layers with bernal stacking order ( aba ... )",
    ", in particular the temperature and magnetic field dependence of @xmath0 reported in literature is far from clear .",
    "for example , early data on the low - field hall coefficient obtained in single - crystalline natural graphite ( scng ) samples showed that it is _ positive _ at fields below and negative above @xmath3 t at a temperature @xmath4k @xcite , suggesting that holes are the majority carriers .",
    "this result appears to be at odd to several other studies on the graphite band structure obtained in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) samples @xcite that suggest that electrons are the majority carriers , unless one argues in terms of different mobilities of the majority carriers , an interpretation that was used indeed in the past .",
    "the difference between the reported hall coefficient obtained in the scng and different hopg samples was the subject of a short paper in 1970 where the authors concluded that the positive low - field hall coefficient is observed for samples with long enough mean free path , i.e. less lattice defects , whereas the negative sign results from boundary scattering in hopg samples due to the relatively small single crystalline grains @xcite . at high",
    "enough applied magnetic fields or high enough temperatures , this coefficient , however , turned negative @xcite .",
    "a positive low - field hall coefficient was already reported in 1953 for graphite samples with small crystal size ( less annealing temperature ) ; it decreased with temperature and changed sign at a sample dependent temperature @xcite .",
    "when the crystalline grain size in the samples was larger than @xmath5 m , the hall coefficient was always negative , at least at @xmath6k @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained in carbons and polycrystalline graphite samples with different crystal size in ref .  , where the authors recognized further that the hall coefficient was highly dependent on the _ alignment _ of crystallites in the samples .",
    "note that these two last reports @xcite are in apparent contradiction to the relationship between crystal size and positive sign of @xmath0 given in ref .  .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that one extra parameter related to the alignment of the crystalline grains in the samples could provide a hint to solve this contradiction .    in the studies of ref   a positive hall coefficient",
    "was reported at 4.2  k that became negative at @xmath7  t for different graphite samples . in that work",
    "@xcite the positive low - field hall coefficient was explained within the two - band model arguing that it is due to the higher mobility of the majority holes in comparison with the mobility of the majority electrons .",
    "however , to understand its behavior as a function of field and temperature , three types of carriers had to be introduced in the calculations @xcite . the low - field coefficient of different kish graphite samples was reported in ref .  .",
    "for the  best \" kish sample , defined as the one with the largest resistivity ratio @xmath8 , the hall coefficient was positive at low fields and turned to negative at @xmath9 t at 4.2  k , similarly to the results for some of the graphite samples reported in ref .  .",
    "the temperature dependence of the zero - field hall coefficient for the  best \" kish specimen was interpreted @xcite taking into account the trigonally warped fermi surfaces in the standard slonczewski - weiss - mcclure s model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the lesser the perfection of the kish graphite samples the larger was the field where the hall coefficient changed sign @xcite",
    ".    recently published hall measurements in micrometer small and thin graphite flakes , peeled off from hopg samples , showed a positive and nearly field independent hall coefficient at @xmath10k up to 8  t applied fields @xcite .",
    "a positive hall coefficient was also observed in similar graphite flakes at @xmath11k , which decreased with temperature , it was field independent to @xmath12  t , decreasing at higher fields @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both results @xcite are in rather good quantitative agreement with the result for the low - field hall coefficient reported 56 years ago for the bulk scng @xcite , in clear contrast to reports in hopg bulk samples @xcite .",
    "further studies on bulk hopg samples showed the existence of an anomalous hall effect and a negative hall coefficient at low fields , interpreted as the result of a magnetic field induced magnetic excitonic state @xcite . also the quantum hall effect ( qhe )",
    "( with electrons as majority carriers ) has been reported in some bulk hopg samples at high enough fields @xcite .",
    "but the qhe in graphite as well as other interesting features of the hall effect behavior like the hole - like contribution with zero mass @xcite in bulk hopg samples , appear to be strongly sample dependent @xcite . a short resume of the literature results can be seen in table  [ tab.1 ] .",
    "evidently , all these , apparently contradictory results indicate us that we need a re - evaluation of the sign , temperature and field behavior of the hall coefficient .",

    "moreover , in some of them josephson coupled superconducting regions exist , oriented parallel to the graphene layers of the graphite matrix @xcite . the interfaces in graphite , whose contribution to the hall effect we discuss in this work , are grain boundaries between crystalline domains with slightly different orientations . those crystalline domains and the two - dimensional borders between them , can be recognized by transmission electron microscopy when the electron beam is applied parallel to the graphene planes of graphite , see e.g. fig .  1 in ref .  ,",
    "fig .  1 in ref .   or figs .  2.2 and 2.9 in ref .  .",

    "following experimental results that indicate the existence of granular superconductivity at certain interfaces in bulk hopg samples of high grade @xcite , it is then appealing to take the contribution of the interfaces in the behavior of the hall effect into account . doing this",

    "the characteristics of the embedded interfaces , as for example their size or area @xcite or the twist angle between the two bernal graphite blocks @xcite can have a direct influence on the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the hall coefficient of a graphite sample with interfaces .",
    "furthermore , the alignment dependence reported earlier @xcite can be understood arguing that the interfaces are created or get larger in area the higher the alignment of the grains . from the presented work",

    "the observed behavior in our samples is similar to that already published @xcite and it can be understood taking into account the contributions of the semiconducting graphene layers in parallel to that from the embedded interfaces and of the sample surfaces ( open and with the substrate ) @xcite . the interfaces contribution is responsible for the maximum in the resistance observed at @xmath45k and @xmath46k for samples s2 and s3 , respectively .",
    "we speculate that the sample surfaces are responsible for the saturation of the resistance at low temperatures , as in s1 for example .",

    "we expect that a magnetic field will have the same influence on the interface contribution as the temperature .",
    "in other words , a large enough magnetic field will destroy the coupling between the superconducting regions , or the superconductivity itself at the interfaces and an extra , electron - like contribution should be measurable , in principle in the whole temperature range .",

    "an estimate of this field can be directly obtained from the longitudinal resistance and the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) observed in several high grade graphite samples , as , e.g. , in sample s2 , see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , or several other samples reported in literature @xcite . from all the results for the longitudinal resistance we expect that a field of the order of 0.1  t should be sufficient to influence substantially the hall coefficient contribution of the interfaces .",

    "note also that a field of the order of 0.1  t is enough to change the sign of the hall coefficient in the sample with clear contribution of the interfaces .",

    "at @xmath6k the hall coefficient is constant below 1  t and decreases above . in the case of the @xmath149m@xmath150 sample reported in ref .",
    "we note that the magnetoresistance is negligible to 10  t applied field and @xmath10k , a result related to the ballistic behavior of the carriers due to their large mean free path @xcite , and the hall coefficient does not depend on field .",
    "a comparison of the hall coefficient and in general of the hall data from literature is not straightforward because the sample quality as well as the existence of interfaces ( of any kind ) was not provided in any of the publications and remains , in general , unknown .",
    "nevertheless , we can speculate the following trends and provide a possible answer to the works listed in tab .",
    "[ tab.1 ] . in refs .",
    ", a positive hall effect was observed for small grains only . upon preparation conditions , smaller grains should have less interfaces , see section  [ int ] , and therefore less contribution from them .",
    "note that the reported dependence of @xmath151 on the _ alignment _ of the crystallites can be directly related to the larger probability to have well - defined and larger interfaces the larger the alignment of the crystallites is .",
    "note that effective critical temperature depends on the size or area of the interfaces according to recently published experimental results@xcite .",
    "the crossover to a negative hall coefficient at large enough fields and temperatures observed in refs .   can be understood in a similar way as shown in sections  [ t - dep ] and [ b - dep ] . in ref .",
    "the hall coefficient was reported to be positive for samples with long mean free path of the carriers and negative for samples with smaller mean free path or high fields .",
    "the crossover to a negative @xmath151 can be understood in the same way if some of the interfaces get normal conducting with field .",
    "now , the reported mean free path dependence of @xmath151 can not be simply interpreted in terms of interfaces contribution without knowing the internal structure of the samples and whether there is or not a crossover to negative @xmath151 at higher fields and temperatures .",
    "if we assume that the carriers in the graphene layers of graphite have much larger mobility@xcite than those carriers at the interfaces in the normal state , we may speculate that samples with smaller mean free path have larger density of interfaces and therefore a negative @xmath151 should be measured .",
    "the negative qhe measured in the hopg samples in refs .   at high fields should come from normal conducting interfaces with a relatively high density of carriers .",
    "note that those hopg samples are the ones that show a high density and well - defined two - dimensional interfaces @xcite . that the qhe is not observed in all hopg samples , even when they are from the same grade@xcite ( or even batch )",
    "is related to a non - homogeneous distribution of the interfaces .",
    "the observation of the ahe in ref .   is related to defects that trigger magnetic order @xcite . note that even in a mesoscopic graphite sample one can find different contributions to the transport depending how homogeneous the sample is , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "therefore , in this kind of samples it is difficult to measure the intrinsic contribution coming from the ideal graphene layers .",
    "finally , the positive @xmath151 measured in refs .   can be expected since those samples were very probably free from interfaces due to their small thickness .",
    "in general we can state that at low enough fields and in thin enough samples with low density of interfaces , the hall coefficient should be closer the one from the ideal bulk graphite than at higher fields .",
    "therefore we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] low - field coefficients obtained from old and recent publications at different temperatures , in case these data were available . from all these data , we conclude that the intrinsic , low magnetic field hall coefficient of graphite appear to be positive with a low - temperature value around @xmath152cm@xmath16/c and a temperature dependence that follows closely that of a semiconductor with an energy gap of the order of 400  k , in agreement with the fits of the longitudinal resistance of different samples @xcite .",
    "note that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] were obtained from graphite samples with very different shapes , i.e. bulk samples in refs .",
    "and mesoscopic samples with different areas in refs .  .",
    "from this comparison we would conclude that the low temperature value of the hall coefficient does not seem to strongly depend on the defined hall geometry .",
    "in conclusion , taking into account the contribution of superconducting regions at certain interfaces found in real graphite samples , we provide a possible explanation for the anomalous temperature and low magnetic field behavior of the hall coefficient as well as for its differences between samples of different origins reported in the last 60 years .",
