    "the concordant , currently dark energy - dominated , spatially flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology is so successful that we are now said to be in an era of  precision cosmology \" @xcite . in this concordant cosmology , dark energy ( de ) , mainly introduced to close the universe and to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe , attracts much attention in the realms of astrophysics and theoretical physics .",
    "the simplest candidate for de is the cosmological constant , and its more general form , known as quintessence , is a cosmic scalar field minimally coupled with the usual matter @xcite . the generalized chaplygin gas , as a unification of dark matter and dark energy ,",
    "was recently proposed and can be constrained by observations @xcite . in other cosmological models ,",
    "de is replaced by certain possible mechanisms , such as brane world cosmologies @xcite and the cardassian expansion model @xcite . despite its success ,",
    "the standard cdm theory of cosmic structure formation has several problems , which exist mostly in the small - scale regime .",
    "for example , the observed rotation curves of dark - matter - dominated dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies tend to favor mass profiles with a flat density core ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , unlike the singular profiles of the cdm @xmath2-body simulations ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1997 , nfw profiles ; moore et al . 1999 ; jing 2000 ; jing & suto 2002 ) and that favored by baryon cooling models ( i.e. , singular isothermal sphere , sis profile ) . while there are debates on whether the observed data were resolved well enough to indicate a soft core @xcite , quite recent @xmath2-body simulations of cdm with higher and higher force and mass resolution still favor cuspy halo profiles @xcite .",
    "recently , an analytical model was presented for the post - collapse equilibrium structure of virialized objects that condense out of a low - density cosmological background universe , with or without a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that cosmological halos form from the collapse and virialization of ` top - hat ' density perturbations , and are spherical , isotropic and isothermal . according to the authors ,",
    "this predicts a unique , non - singular , truncated isothermal sphere ( ntis ) and provides a simple physical clue about the existence of soft cores in halos of cosmological origin .",
    "this ntis model is claimed to be in good agreement with observations of the internal structure of dark matter dominated halos on scales ranging from dwarf galaxies to x - ray clusters .",
    "in particular , it matches quite well the mass profiles of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies deduced from their observed rotation curves @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the ntis model was revisited by using the self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) hypothesis @xcite .",
    "there are other efforts for analytical derivations of the density profile ; e.g. , @xcite derived the bound on the central density slope of -1 analytically ( as found numerically by nfw ) .",
    "this is done by a simple solution to the jeans equation , which is valid under the assumption that both the central density profile and the phase - space - like density are exact power laws . however",
    ", this work did not clearly give a density core .    to investigate whether there is a soft core at the center of each cdm halo",
    ", we use another independent and robust tool , gravitational lensing , which has been widely used to detect the mass distributions in the universe @xcite and the dark energy density and its equation of state @xcite .",
    "recently , motivated by the current largest homogeneous sample of lensed quasars , coming from the radio cosmic lens all - sky survey(class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an extension of the earlier jodrell bank / very large array astrometric survey ( jvas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much work has been devoted to statistics of strong lensing to constrain the cosmological parameters and mass distribution @xcite .",
    "statistics of strong gravitational lensing by halos with a soft core was studied quite early @xcite , but no observational sample suitable for analysis could be used in their work ; in particular , they did not use their cored density profile to fit the observed rotation curves of the dwarf and lsb disk galaxies . in strong gravitational lensing of quasars ,",
    "the separation between multiple images is the most important observable . in some instances , asymmetry and shear of lens halos",
    "affect the properties of images considerably , but statistically , image separations are mainly determined by the potential wells of the host halos characterized by the slopes of their density profiles .",
    "thus , the probabilities for lensing by ntis halos with image separations greater than @xmath3 provide us with an independent and powerful probe of the existence of soft cores of cdm halos .",
    "our calculations are performed in a concordant , spatially flat @xmath4cdm cosmology favored by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plus large - scale structure ( lss ) data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with matter density parameter @xmath5 , galaxy fluctuation amplitude @xmath6 , and hubble parameter @xmath7 . for comparison",
    ", we also give the results when ntis is replaced by sis+nfw and nfw profiles .",
    "in what follows , we use a reduced mass of a halo defined as @xmath8 .",
    "the ntis model is based on the assumption that cosmological halos form from the collapse and virialization of top - hat density perturbations and are spherical , isotropic , and isothermal @xcite .",
    "the well - fitted density profile is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the central value of the density profile is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the critical density of the universe at the epoch of halo collapse with redshift @xmath16 .",
    "the small core radius depends on mass @xmath17 and @xmath16 and is given by @xmath18^{-1/3}h^{-1}\\mathrm{mpc } , \\label{r0}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath19 $ ] ( with @xmath5 and @xmath20 in later calculations ) and @xmath21 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the original formula for @xmath22 , equation ( 88 ) in @xcite , is @xmath23 ( we write @xmath24 as @xmath17 , which is discussed in section 3 ) .",
    "this is a clerical error , but we have checked that their subsequent results are not affected by this wrong formula .",
    "the gravitational lens equation is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the physical positions of a source in the source plane and an image in the image plane , respectively , @xmath28 is the deflection angle , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the angular diameter distances from observer to lens , observer to source , and lens to source , respectively . by defining dimensionless positions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and dimensionless angle @xmath34 ,",
    "the lens equation is then @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the central convergence : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the critical surface density .",
    "it is well known that generally , for any spherically symmetric density profiles of lensing halos , multiple images can be produced only if the central convergence is greater than unity @xcite . when @xmath39 , only one image is produced .",
    "note that even if @xmath40 is satisfied , multiple images can occur only when the source is located within @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is determined from the lensing equation ( eq . [ [ lenseq1 ] ] ) with @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( this is similar to lensing by nfw halos ) . for a singular density profile such as the sis and nfw profiles , the central value is divergent , so @xmath45 is always satisfied , and multiple images can be produced for any given mass . for density profiles with a finite soft core such as the ntis profile",
    ", however , the condition @xmath45 requires that only halos with mass greater than a certain value ( determined by @xmath46 ) can produce multiple images .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure 1 , where three curves for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are plotted , and when @xmath49 , only one image is produced . in lensing statistics ,",
    "this requirement will limit the populations of lensing halos to quite a small fraction .",
    "such a conclusion is valid for any lensing halos with a finite soft core , which is discussed in detail later .",
    "when quasars at redshift @xmath50 are lensed by foreground cdm halos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , the lensing probability for image separations larger than @xmath3 is @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the redshift distribution for quasars approximated by a gaussian model with a mean of 1.27 and a dispersion of 0.95 @xcite , @xmath53 is the proper distance from the observer to the lens located at redshift @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the physical number density of virialized dark halos of masses between @xmath17 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the magnification bias .",
    "the physical number density @xmath55 is related to the comoving number density @xmath58 by @xmath59 ; the latter is originally given by @xcite , and the extended version is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the current mean mass density of the universe and @xmath62 is the mass function for which we use the expression given by @xcite . in this expression , @xmath63 ,",
    "in which @xmath64 is the overdensity threshold for spherical collapse at redshift @xmath54 and @xmath65 is the rms of the present variance of the fluctuations in a sphere containing a mean mass @xmath17 .",
    "the overdensity threshold is given by @xmath66 for the @xmath4cdm cosmology @xcite , where @xmath67/[g(\\omega_{\\mathrm{m}})(1+z)]$ ] is the linear growth function of the density perturbation @xcite , in which @xmath68 and @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "when we calculate the variance of the fluctuations @xmath70 , we use the fitting formulae for the cdm power spectrum @xmath71 given by @xcite , where @xmath72 is the amplitude normalized to @xmath73 , given by observations .",
    "the cross section for lensing is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a step function , and @xmath76 is the minimum mass of halos above which lenses can produce images with separations greater than @xmath3 . the minimum mass @xmath76 can be derived directly from the relationship between the mass of a lens halo and the corresponding image separation , as follows .",
    "it is obvious from figure 1 that the separation between the outer two images is almost independent of the source position @xmath77 .",
    "thus , similar to the analysis for nfw profiles @xcite , the image separation @xmath78 produced by a ntis halo for a source at @xmath77 can be well approximated by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the einstein radius determined from the lens equation with @xmath81 .",
    "the angular image separation is @xmath82 then , from this equation and equation([r0 ] ) we have @xmath83 \\mathrm{h}^{-1}m_{\\sun},\\ ] ] where @xmath84mpc is the present hubble radius .",
    "the magnification bias @xmath57 is calculated numerically with @xmath85^{1.1}\\ ] ] given by @xcite , where @xmath86 is the total magnification of the two outer images for a source at @xmath77 ; this can also be computed numerically .",
    "the numerical results of eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) for ntis lens halos are plotted in figure 2 ( _ thin solid line _ ) . for comparison ,",
    "the survey results of jvas / class and the predicted probability for lensing by sis + nfw and nfw profiles are also shown . a subset of 8958 sources from the combined jvas / class survey form a well - defined statistical sample containing 13 multiply imaged sources ( lens systems ) suitable for analysis of the lens statistics @xcite .",
    "the observed lensing probabilities can be easily calculated @xcite by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the number of lenses with separation greater than @xmath3 in 13 lenses .",
    "the observational probability @xmath89 is plotted as a histogram in figure 2 . in the two - population model sis + nfw , the galaxy - size and the cluster - size lens halos",
    "are approximated by sis and nfw profiles , respectively @xcite . in the one - population model nfw ,",
    "lens halos with different sizes are all approximated by nfw profiles @xcite ; this is similar to the ntis model .",
    "the theoretically predicted lensing probabilities shown in figure 2 are calculated separately for three cases ( ntis , sis+nfw and nfw ) according to equation ( [ prob1 ] ) .",
    "the differences in lensing probability distributions for the three cases arise from their different values for the lensing cross section @xmath90 and magnification bias @xmath57 , since these two quantities are determined uniquely from the corresponding density profile . here",
    "we have recalculated the lensing probabilities for sis + nfw and nfw profiles according to equation ( [ prob1 ] ) . since the density profiles , lensing equations , and lensing cross sections for sis and nfw profiles",
    "have been discussed many times in the literature , here we only give the final results of lensing probabilities for these two models ( for details about sis+nfw and nfw profiles , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one can see clearly from figure 2 that probability for lensing by ntis halos with an image separation greater than @xmath3 is far too low to match the observational results of class / jvas ; it is even much less than that for nfw lenses .",
    "we thus conclude that , at least , ntis as a model to approximate density profiles of dark matter halos is ruled out by statistical strong lensing . within the framework of statistics of strong lensing as displayed in the literature , no mechanism can save this model .",
    "in fact the above conclusion is general for any mass profile with a flat soft core characterized by the core density @xmath91 and core radius @xmath92 ( these two parameters are determined by rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf and lsb disk galaxies ) . to see this , we revisit another such density profile , an isothermal sphere with a soft core ( cored isothermal sphere , cis ) : @xmath93 @xcite , where @xmath94 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "the lens equation is @xmath95 where @xmath77 and @xmath96 are defined in the same way as in equation ( [ lenseq1 ] ) ( here @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 is the central convergence .",
    "similarly , multiple images can be produced if and only if @xmath99 . the corresponding lens equation is plotted in figure 3 for three different values of @xmath100 ; the curves are quite similar to the ntis model , even though their density profiles seem quite different .",
    "it is not difficult to understand the extremely low value of the probability for lensing by dark halos with a flat soft core .",
    "in fact , in our previous calculations , for the ntis profile , @xmath101 can be written in the form @xmath102^{2/3 } \\frac{d_\\mathrm{r}}{c / h_0 } , \\label{kc3}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 .",
    "we have defined , as usual , the mass of a dark matter halo to be @xmath104 ( @xmath105 has its usual definition ) and assume that the redshift @xmath16 by which the dark halo collapsed is equal to the lens location redshift @xmath106 and that such an assumption will not affect our results @xcite . for a source at @xmath107 and",
    "the lens at @xmath108 , equation ( [ kc3 ] ) gives @xmath109 . in this case",
    ", @xmath110 implies @xmath111 , and this means that for this typical lens system , multiple images can be produced only when the lens mass is higher than @xmath112 , which is the typical size of galaxy clusters . by setting @xmath110 in equation ( [ kc3 ] ) , the minimum lens mass for producing multiple images",
    "is determined as a function of both @xmath106 and @xmath113 . in figure 4",
    ", we plot the mass @xmath114 ( measured in @xmath115 ) as a function of @xmath113 for three given values of @xmath106 : 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 . for a given @xmath106 , the minimum mass decreases with increasing @xmath113 .",
    "since the mean value of the redshift of the sources is @xmath116 in our calculations , the actual mean value of the mass for producing multiple images ( for lenses at @xmath108 ) is larger than @xmath112 .",
    "it is also obvious in figure 4 that in most cases , multiple images can be produced only when the halo mass is larger than @xmath112 . from equation ( [ prob1 ] ) , we know that the lensing probability is determined by the number density of dark halos and the cross section . as pointed out by @xcite , an nfw profile would produce more multiple - image lenses than an ntis one at relatively lower masses , and this trend is reversed at higher masses . statistically , however , it is the requirement of @xmath117 and thus the existence of a large core radius that strongly limits the populations of lensing halos [ number density @xmath55 ] to quite a small fraction .",
    "thus , the extremely low value of the probability for lensing by ntis halos arises from the quite low value of the corresponding number density of galaxy clusters .",
    "furthermore , the lensing cross section @xmath119 , and from figure 1 and figure 3 we see that @xmath120 is quite sensitive to @xmath121 rather than @xmath101 itself .",
    "therefore , a slight change in @xmath122 will result in a large change both in @xmath120 and @xmath80 ( the einstein radius ) , and since @xmath123 , this explains the quite flat curve for the ntis lensing probability in figure 2 ( _ thin solid line _ ) .",
    "namely , the insensitivity of ntis lensing probability to @xmath3 reflects the fact that within the image separations of a few arcseconds , the lens mass and thus the corresponding number density of dark halos around that mass change only a little .",
    "similarly , for a cis profile , after solving the equations @xmath124 for @xmath105 and @xmath125 , @xmath100 can be related to dark halo mass @xmath17 .",
    "the above analysis for the ntis profile then is also true for the cis model , if core radius @xmath92 is large enough to be able to fit the observed rotation curves of the dwarf and lsb disk galaxies .",
    "note that our conclusion that a cis model as a cored mass profile is ruled out by statistical strong gravitational lensing seems inconsistent with previous works @xcite , since these authors used this model to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "a simple analysis , however , shows us that there is no discrepancy .",
    "the central convergence can be expressed in terms of the mass and the core radius of a lens halo .",
    "for ntis , from equation ( [ r0 ] ) and equation ( [ kc1 ] ) , we have @xmath126 ; for cis , from equation ( [ kc2 ] ) , equation ( [ mball ] ) and equation ( [ sigmav ] ) we have ( approximately ) @xmath127 . a larger @xmath92 needs a larger @xmath17 to ensure @xmath128 , or , for a fixed value of mass @xmath17",
    ", an appropriate smaller value of @xmath92 would ensure @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath92 is not determined by currently observed rotation curves of the dwarf and lsb disk galaxies , but rather is adjustable @xcite , then no discrepancy appears . a more realistic mass profile should not be divergent at the center ( cusp ) ,",
    "that is , it should have a flat core , but the core radius @xmath92 should be small enough to ensure that the lensing probability matches the observations of class / jvas .",

    "<S> we use the statistics of strong gravitational lenses to investigate whether mass profiles with a flat density core are supported . the probability for lensing by halos modeled by a nonsingular truncated isothermal sphere ( ntis ) with image separations greater than a certain value ( ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) </S>",
    "<S> is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> ntis is an analytical model for the postcollapse equilibrium structure of virialized objects derived by shapiro , iliev , & raga . </S>",
    "<S> this profile has a soft core and matches quite well with the mass profiles of dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies deduced from their observed rotation curves . </S>",
    "<S> it also agrees well with the nfw ( navarro - frenk - white ) profile at all radii outside of a few ntis core radii . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , comparing the results with those for singular lensing halos ( nfw and sis+nfw ) and strong lensing observations , the probabilities for lensing by ntis halos are far too low . as this result is valid for any other nonsingular density profiles ( with a large core radius ) , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that nonsingular density profiles ( with a large core radius ) for cdm halos are ruled out by statistics of strong gravitational lenses . </S>"
