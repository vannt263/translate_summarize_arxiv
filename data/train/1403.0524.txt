    "overall , first - principles calculations offer the ability to fully exploit the information in experimental nmr data .",
    "the sensitivity of nmr experiments to molecular geometry and electronic structure is a ` double - edged sword , ' being both an important chemical probe and a challenge to the computational theorist . for small , finite , systems , nmr parameters such as magnetic shielding , electric field gradients and j - coupling",
    "can be routinely calculated with quantum chemical methods based on local orbitals and have demonstrated value in assigning solution - state spectra @xcite .",
    "treatment of solid - state nmr systems with these methods requires the creation of finite - clusters , which need careful convergence with respect to the size of the cluster to ensure that the appropriate electronic environment is reconstructed .",
    "they also require careful selection of the basis set used to represent the wave function to ensure numerical convergence .",
    "a planewave approach with pseudopotentials is appealing for its algorithmic efficiency , automatic inclusion of periodic boundary conditions and easy systematic convergence of basis sets via the maximum kinetic energy of the waves used .",
    "however , since such calculations require the use of pseudopotentials , the calculated pseudo - wave function is non - physical near the nucleus , the very region that is so influential to nmr parameters .",
    "the development of the gauge - including projector augmented wave ( gipaw ) method@xcite has enabled calculations of magnetic shielding in extended systems using pseudopotentials by reconstructing the form of the all - electron wavefunction near the nucleus .",
    "extensive reviews are available in refs . and .",
    "this paper concerns itself with the theoretical prediction of nmr j - coupling , or indirect spin - spin coupling , particularly in solid - state systems with heavy ions .",
    "j - coupling is the indirect magnetic coupling between two nuclei mediated via the bonding electrons .",
    "it manifests in nmr spectra as fine structure splitting of resonant peaks , providing information on bonds such as strength , angles and the connectivity network .",
    "j - coupling has been well - studied in the gas and solution state for many decades , as the multiplet splitting in peaks is well resolved due to molecular tumbling decoupling anisotropic interactions .",
    "in contrast , solid - state j - coupling studies are more challenging due to anisotropic broadening .",
    "recent advances in solid - state nmr experiments , such as higher mas spinning rates ( up to 90khz ) and ultra - high magnetic field strengths ( up to 23.3 t ) , have resulted in increased experimental and theoretical interest@xcite in measurements of j.    joyce et al.@xcite developed a method to calculate j - coupling constants from first - principles in extended systems within a planewave - pseudopotential density - functional theory ( dft ) framework , using paw to reconstruct the all - electron properties of the system .",
    "this method has been validated for a small number of systems containing light atoms against quantum chemical calculations and against experimental data @xcite .",
    "there is great interest in making this a ` full periodic table ' method , i.e. being able to reliably treat systems containing any elements .",
    "however , it is known@xcite that j - coupling in systems containing heavy ions is extremely sensitive to the effects of special relativity .",
    "this is because both core states and valence states near the nucleus attain high kinetic energy and so should be treated using the dirac equation , leading to contraction in the wave function and corrections to the operators representing electromagnetic ( em ) interactions .",
    "scalar relativistic effects ( i.e. ignoring spin - orbit terms ) in particular have been found to be the dominant correction in full four - component dirac equation calculations@xcite , at least for one - bond couplings .",
    "autschbach and ziegler@xcite developed the application of the zeroth - order regular approximation ( zora ) , an approximation to the dirac equation , using dft to the prediction of j - coupling in an all - electron , local orbital framework .",
    "yates et al.@xcite developed the use of zora with pseudopotentials and paw for the calculation of nmr chemical shifts in systems containing heavy ions . in this paper",
    "we will incorporate the scalar - relativistic terms of autschbach and ziegler s zora approach within a planewave pseudopotential dft@xcite framework to give a highly efficient method for predicting j - coupling within extended systems containing heavy ions at negligible extra computational cost as compared to the non - relativistic method .",
    "we also provide some improvements to the non - relativistic method of joyce et al.@xcite , removing some of the numerical difficulties present in that approach , and generalising the method to use state - of - the - art ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "we carefully benchmark our planewave - pseudopotential implementation against both experiment and existing quantum chemical calculations , and conclude by examining the effects of relativity on j - couplings in two ag - containing molecular crystals .",
    "we will proceed by first reviewing the derivation of the zeroth - order regular approximation from the dirac equation",
    ". then we will show how a scalar - relativistic theory of nmr j - coupling can be derived from the zora hamiltonian .",
    "we then discuss blchl s paw as a general formalism for the calculation of all - electron properties from pseudopotential calculations and derive a form of the scalar - relativistic theory that is suitable for efficient pseudopotentials calculations .",

    ".      in nmr , indirect spin - spin coupling or j - coupling is an interaction between two nuclear moments due to indirect coupling mediated by the electrons in the system .",
