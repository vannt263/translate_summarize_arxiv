    "a recent very interesting topic of research has been to transform hydrodynamics , in its lagrangian formulation , into a quantum field theory @xcite . at first",
    ", the whole idea of quantizing `` hot '' hydrodynamics ( as opposed to phonons in low - temperature systems : the next section discusses the difference ) seems wrong - headed : `` everybody knows '' that hydrodynamics is an effective theory describing the infrared limit of a microscopic many - particle system @xcite .",
    "such a theory should be inherently classical , since local occupation number is `` large '' and all information about interparticle entanglement is lost in the infrared high temperature limit .",
    "nevertheless , several motivations exist for this effort : the most obvious is `` just to see what happens '' : lagrangian hydrodynamics can be rewritten into the form of a field theory @xcite , so why not quantize it ?",
    "another motivation is the hope is that this limit might help us understand something about the `` lowest quantum limit for viscosity '' @xmath0 ( or , to be more exact , the dimensionless ratio @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the entropy density ) , widely believed to exist but never conclusively estimated from general principles ; existing estimates of this lowest limit are based either on non - rigorous assumptions ( for example @xcite , where the supposedly infinitely strongly coupled fluid is described by a boltzmann equation ) or on theories with classical supergravity holographic limits @xcite , well - defined mathematically but whose connection to the real world is problematic .    moreover , quantizing lagrangian hydrodynamics could lead to both anomalous and dissipative terms being captured as an effective field theory @xcite , avoiding the ambiguities currently plaguing existing approaches , such as the gradient expansion @xcite , to derive hydrodynamics as an effective limit of a microscopic theory .    finally ,",
    "while the system described here seems removed from anything accessible experimentally , phenomenological repercussions are not a priori excluded : the viscosity of the system created in heavy ion collisions might well be so low @xcite that a sound wave    * carrying momentum @xmath3 where @xmath4 are , respectively , the energy density ( and its perturbation @xmath5 ) , the speed of sound , the wavenumber and the temperature .",
    "* of wavenumber @xmath6 in natural units    will live ( not decay to @xmath7 ) for a time @xmath8 . in this regime , _ some kind of _ quantum correction to hydrodynamic evolution becomes mandatory , and quantizing the sound - waves is the simplest ansatz that comes to mind .",
    "one major stumbling block is that , as @xcite has shown , this `` quantum hydrodynamics '' seems at best ambiguous .",
    "possibly because of turbulence , it is not clear that a stable ground state around which a perturbative expansion can be computed exists in @xcite . moreover , the approach in @xcite and @xcite can not at the moment include dissipative corrections , since by necessity these are non - unitary , and can not be accommodated by the evolution of a pure quantum state .    a possible way to understand these ambiguities",
    "was pointed out in @xcite : as is well - known from the non - relativistic hydrodynamics limit , the @xmath9 limit is made highly non - trivial due to hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite : as @xmath9 , sound - waves can propagate to asymptotically large distances .",
    "as this limit coincides with the infrared limit in which the transport coefficients are calculated @xcite , these two limits do not in general commute : in the low viscosity limit the viscosity needs to be _ renormalized _ by a contribution due to sound - waves traveling to asymptotically large distances . assuming the maximum wavenumber of sound - waves @xmath10 , when the `` bare viscosity '' @xmath11 the `` renormalized viscosity '' @xmath12 .",
    "the contribution of this divergence to the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 is vanishing in the limit of large microscopic degeneracy @xmath13 limit since @xmath14 while the backreaction terms always @xmath15 .",
    "this means backreaction is irrelevant for yang - mills type theories with a large number of colors @xmath16 , since @xmath17 : @xmath18 , so the limit depends on `` what diverges faster '' .",
    "for instance , in theories with supergravity duals @xmath19 . the applicability of classical supergravity , therefore , is equivalent to postulating such corrections are negligible .",
    "physically , the divergence in @xmath13 can be understood by the requirement that collective degrees of freedom ( sound waves etc ) carry a negligible amount of entropy w.r.t .",
    "microscopic degrees of freedom and hence , do not fluctuate @xcite .",
    "if @xmath13 does not diverge ( for example , physical qcd at @xmath20 ) and at finite temperature , collective excitations carry a measurable fraction of the entropy w.r.t .",
    "microscopic excitations , and hence their fluctuations can not anymore be neglected . in this regime",
    "@xcite show that backreaction is not necessarily negligible .",
    "an additional problem is that @xcite compares the _ macroscopic viscosity _ with the _ microscopic _ entropy . to estimate a _ fully macroscopic _",
    "@xmath1 with the approach of @xcite , one would need to    * estimate the contribution to the _ entropy density _ resulting from an equilibrated `` gas of soundwaves '' * take the sound - sound interactions fully into account while calculating viscosity .    in this work ,",
    "address both the open questions in @xcite and in @xcite by calculating the `` quantum viscosity '' of an _ ideal _ fluid such as the one of @xcite .",
    "there is a hope to do this self - consistently since quantization will allow us to unambiguously assign an entropy and a viscosity to a gas of lorentz - scalar sound - waves .    that an entropy can be unambiguously assigned after quantization is clear from considering the finite occupation number of each sound mode .",
    "that a viscosity can also be assigned is also clear from considering the kolmogorov cascade @xcite evolution of a turbulent system : a classical kolmogorov cascade , which typically converts higher amplitude lower frequency perturbations into lower amplitude , higher frequency ones , can go on indefinitely since there is no automatic relationship between the wavenumber of the perturbation and its energy .",
    "quantization will automatically cut the cascade off by assigning more energy to higher frequency modes . since in classical hydrodynamics",
    "the kolmogorov cascade is cut - off by viscous effects @xcite , this quantum cut - off can be understood as an effective quantum viscosity .",
    "the full hydrodynamic lagrangian will also allow us to calculate the interactions between these sound waves by usual feynman diagram techniques @xcite , and to see whether quantum corrections tame the divergence pointed out in @xcite , in a way that gives a finite renormalized @xmath1 ( even with @xmath21 diverging separately ) .",
    "since the theory in @xcite is non - renormalizeable , it is not surprising that quantum perturbations give an inherently non - unitary dissipative correction ( a similar situation exists in efts such as chiral perturbation theory @xcite , where unitarity is restored by hand at each order . unlike this theory , however , viscous hydrodynamics is explicitly dissipative , and hence non - unitary ) .",
    "we nevertheless argue that looking for fixed points in @xmath1 when the `` microscopic '' parameters diverge could be used to extract an estimate for the lower quantum limit of @xmath1 and its dependence on the equation of state .",
    "we consider an ideal quantum fluid of the type described in @xcite , and use the notation of these works henceforward .",
    "first , to avoid confusion , we emphasize that this theory is fundamentally different from the usual `` sound quantization '' ( `` phonons '' ) associated , for example , with liquid helium and superconductors .",
    "the latter is usually a system at high chemical potential ( high particle density ) and very low temperature , so @xmath22 and the system is essentially a quantum many - body wavefunction . here",
    ", there is _ no _ chemical potential since there are no conserved quantum numbers , and all energy is encoded into temperature .",
    "the `` conserved quantity '' that moves around during the fluid s evolution is _ not _ particle number but _ microscopic entropy _ which is non - zero ( as it usually is in a coherent quantum system ) because the microscopic degrees of freedom are perfectly thermalized and fully incoherent , an assumption equivalent to that of perfect fluidity .",
    "this work rests on the assumption that _ macroscopic _ degrees of freedom can be meaningfully quantized in this limit .",
    "the `` yes '' answer , assumed here and in @xcite , is reasonable simply because , as argued in the introduction , for arbitrarily low viscosities quantum corrections to sound - waves _ must _ make an appearance .",
    "nevertheless , this assumption has not to our knowledge explored from the `` microscopic qft '' point of view .",
    "the degrees of freedom of such a chargeless ideal fluid , in the lagrangian formulation , are the spatial coordinates @xmath23 of a fluid volume element comoving with that element .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , if the lagrangian is a function of @xmath24 _ only _ @xmath25 where @xmath26 the energy momentum tensor will have the form of a relativistic ideal fluid @xcite @xmath27 where the energy density and pressure are @xmath28 @xmath29 and the flow is @xmath30 the relation @xmath31 shows that , other than the somewhat unorthodox notation , the approach used here coincides with the usual lagrangian hydrodynamics used in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the formulae above can be used to show that @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is therefore , a locally conserved quantity , the only one of this theory",
    ". we will identify it with the microscpic entropy , up to a `` degeneracy '' constant @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath34 note that @xmath13 could very well diverge if the `` microscopic '' and `` macroscopic '' degrees of freedom are well - separated ( as it does , for example , in theories with a classical gravity dual such as @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce this constant in light of the arguments made in the introductions about balancing microscopic and macroscopic entropy .",
    "as we shall see these issues do _ not _ go away once the fluid is quantized .",
    "the `` equilibrium '' between microscopic and macroscopic degrees of freedom can then be ensured by the gibbs - duhem relation @xcite , relating entropy @xmath2,temperature @xmath35 and enthalpy @xmath36 . @xmath37",
    "the choice of @xmath13 and the gibbs - duhem relation specifies the microscopic temperature as @xmath38 ( note that if energy stays finite but @xmath13 diverges , @xmath39 ) .",
    "since everything is formulated via the lagrangian notation , at this point nothing prevents us from quantizing using the usual sum - over - path prescription and calculating any expectation value of a fully - quantum operator @xcite .",
    "for example , the quantum two - point function for the energy - momentum tensor eq .",
    "[ entensor ] will be @xmath40 @xmath41\\ ] ] calculating anything is however a very non - trivial affair , since even the simplest `` ideal gas '' equation of state @xmath42 gives rise to a deeply intractable theory where , as will become shortly clear , the existence of a useful decomposition into free states ( an s - matrix definition ) is laden with problems .",
    "perturbatively , however , we can make progress by expanding around a hydrostatic solution where the background is fixed at a constant @xmath43 plus transverse and longitudinal `` phonons '' ( note the difference between these and what are usually called phonons , explained at the start of this section ) @xmath44 the symmetries evident in the lagrangian description make it simple to show that the only `` non - trivial '' excitations are transversely polarized `` vortices '' and longitudinally polarized `` sound - waves '' .",
    "a short calculation is however enough to confirm the result , known to anyone familiar with fluids , that classical vortices in ideal fluids _ live forever _ , carry an arbitrarily small amount of energy and an arbitrarily large amount of momentum , but _ do not propagate _ @xcite .",
    "basic quantum field theory , therefore , shows that any scattering approximation breaks down in the presence of vortices , as `` virtual vortices '' can be generated for arbitrarily long times with no energy cost @xcite .",
    "a somewhat ad hoc but consistent fix to this @xcite is to add a small propagation velocity for vortices by considering the lagrangian not of a fluid but of a `` soft jelly '' @xmath45 a fluid can then be thought of as @xmath46 .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is not anymore a conserved quantity even at the classical level , as we have @xmath47 @xmath48 this is equivalent to shifting @xmath49 .",
    "the conserved charge corresponding to entropy will correspondingly get a contribution from transverse stresses , @xmath50 this looks somewhat similar to the familiar bulk viscosity term ; however , it is radically different as the equations of @xmath24 and @xmath51 are still non - dissipative .",
    ". [ eqsct ] will be augmented by additional classical equations of motion for @xmath51 derivable from eq .",

    "hence , classically , if we adjust the initial conditions to ensure that @xmath52 , entropy as defined in eq .",
    "[ sdef ] will tend to a conserved quantity .",

    "however , @xmath70 means bose - einstein corrections become important at _ arbitrary _ temperature .",
    "hence , for vortices , the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution is never a good approximation @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a cutoff @xmath71 , which could be brought to infinity for really ideal fluids or kept large but finite if this is an eft - type expansion , as suggested in @xcite .    note that @xmath72 is _ not _ the temperature of the microscopic degrees of freedom but the temperature of a _ gas of sound waves and vortices_. in an imperfect fluid , the two scales ( the gas of sound - waves and vortices and the microscopic degrees of freedom ) mutually thermalize after a time @xmath73 ( in the @xmath74 limit all vortices and sound - waves just dissipate , for @xmath75 the system converges to a thermalized fluid with finite energy , momentum and angular momentum described in @xcite ) .",
    "in an ideal fluid , the two systems _ never _ reach thermal equilibrium , as can be understood from the fact that the microscopic and macroscopic scales are infinitely separated in ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "this is why we ignore the microscopic contribution to the entropy rather than adding it to eq .",
    "[ entropy ] ( thereby avoiding the issue of double - counting entropy for finite @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is also why , in the next section , we shall ignore the microscopic viscosity ( usually , in multicomponent systems the smallest viscosity dominates . in our fluid , therefore , the `` zero '' microscopic viscosity should dominate over the finite viscosity carried by the sound waves ) .",
    "we nevertheless equalize the microscopic and microscopic temperature as an _ initial condition _ , and therefore assume the validity of the gibbs - duhem relation eq .",
    "[ gibbs ] also for the _ macroscopic _ gas . if we do not , our final @xmath1 will depend on the arbitrary ratio of temperatures at the two scales .",
    "comparing eq . [ ttcorr ] with the kubo formula @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 refers to thermodynamic equilibrium and where @xmath78 are the appropriate components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 @xmath80",
    "makes it immediately apparent that quantum corrections to an `` ideal '' fluid will inevitably give rise to viscous terms .",
    "this is a `` quantum '' restatement of the result quoted in @xcite , that when viscosity is small enough a significant contribution to both entropy and viscosity will be carried by _",
    "sound waves_. eq .",
    "[ etakubo ] will therefore need to be renormalized to take the effect of backreaction by sound - waves and vortices into account .    to do this",

    "[ lfluid ] or it s `` jelly '' extension eq .",

    "[ etakubo ] would be a very non - trivial exercise .",
    "luckily it can be shown @xcite that the kubo formulae to leading order ( 1-loop . at tree level @xmath79 in the grand canonical ensemble",

    "this can be thought of as a finite temperature analogue of the optical theorem ( see fig .",
    "[ figkubo ] )    fortunately , given the results in @xcite , doing this is a relatively straight - forward exercise .",

    "for the qualitative estimate , the decay processes examined in @xcite ( e.g. @xmath92 ) play no role , but they will renormalize the `` mass '' and `` coupling constant '' of the soundwave in a way that , in a finite temperature environment , needs to be resummed @xcite .",
    "these corrections , @xmath93 are left for further work .",
    "the bulk viscosity @xmath94 is related to the shear viscosity by the classical formula @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is _ not _ the microscopic speed of sound , but rather the speed of a `` sound wave in a gas of sound - waves an vortices '' . for a gas of sound - waves of speed",
    "@xmath84 this will not be equal to @xmath97 since the dispersion relation of the sound waves is not @xmath98 , but will have to be calculated by a formula such as @xmath99 where again @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the temperature and entropy of the gas of sound waves .",
    "thus , quantizing hydrodynamics inevitably breaks any conformal symmetry present at the classical level .",

    "physically , this is a manifestation of the fact that such vortices can , in the hydrodynamic limit , live for an arbitrarily long time , spoiling the `` free sound - wave '' approximation . for finite @xmath13",

    "we will see , however , that this divergence can be cancelled by a divergence in @xmath13 .",

    "we will discuss on how to go beyond this procedure , but , as we will show , this procedure does provide a recipe of eliminating @xmath85 and @xmath13 dependence from @xmath1 , at least to one - loop order .",

    ", the answer seems to be yes .",

    "these will be explored in @xcite .",
    "a more systematic approach would be to put this theory on the lattice , in order to both see how far is the vacuum state from the `` hydrostatic one '' , and to find out whether the theory has a `` trivial '' continuum limit . since , as argued throughout this work , the ratio of the microscopic to macroscopic entropy ( parametrized here by @xmath13 ) is as important as the mean free path in determining quantum fluctuations , an intriguing possibility is that @xmath13 drives a phase transition between a `` classical vacuum state '' and a `` quantum - turbulent '' vacuum state , analogously to the finite density phase transition in the number of colors ( @xmath17 in gauge theory ) discussed in @xcite .",

    "this apparent paradox has given rise to quite a lot of theoretical activity , from heavy ions to black holes and condensed - matter systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    one physical resolution to this paradox in the context of a quantum field theory is to note that the hilbert space goes to arbitrary high momenta , but any conceivable experiment has a finite - momentum resolution , parametrized by a scale @xmath71 .",
    "observables , therefore , must inevitably be _ renormalized _ , with a division into _ slow _ degrees of freedom ( which we observe ) and fast ones ( at much higher energy @xmath71 than any scale of our detector , they can only appear as virtual states suppressed by powers of @xmath152 ) @xcite .    for matrix elements with definite numbers of particles",
    "( `` n - point functions '' ) this cut - off can be absorbed into a redefinition of the lagrangian . for observables tracing over an undefined number of particles ( such as the thermally averaged quantities , @xmath153 and @xmath154 described in this work ) the cut - off inevitably introduces dissipative terms into the observable s equation of motion .",
    "this is obvious from the fact that wilson s coarse - graining @xcite looks exactly like decoherence @xcite , with the fast degrees of freedom playing the role of the environment and the slow ones of the system .",
    "these terms will also be suppressed by powers of @xmath71 , but the example of turbulence shows that a small viscosity does not necessarily mean small entropy generation .",
    "while we can not at the moment prove that @xmath155 corresponds to a renormalization group flow , the fact that a non - zero @xmath1 arises out of a quantized ideal fluid suggests that the considerations above apply whether the system s observable degrees of freedom are `` microscopic '' particles or `` macroscopic '' collective excitations such as sound - waves and vortices .    in conclusion",
