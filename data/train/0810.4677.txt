    "recently , ideas originally due to lee and wick @xcite were used to propose @xcite a  lee - wick standard model \" , a modification of the standard model of particle physics in which the higgs mass is stabilized against quadratically divergent radiative corrections and which in this sense is an alternative to supersymmetry for solving the hierarchy problem . the lagrangian includes new higher derivative operators for each field . these operators can be eliminated by introducing a set of auxiliary fields , one for each field of the original model .",
    "the higher derivative terms have opposite sign for both the kinetic and mass terms , which indicates how the quadratic divergences in the higgs mass can be cancelled .    fields with opposite sign of the kinetic term in the action have recently been invoked in cosmology to provide models for dark energy .",
    "fields with negative kinetic energy but positive potential energy are called  phantom field \" @xcite and were introduced to provide a possible mechanism for obtaining an equation of state of dark energy with an equation of state parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 being pressure and energy density , respectively .",
    "in addition to the conceptual problems of having phantom fields ( see e.g @xcite ) , phantom dark energy models lead to future singularities . to avoid these problems , the  quintom model \"",
    "@xcite was introduced .",
    "this model contains two scalar fields , one of them with a regular sign kinetic term , the second with an opposite sign kinetic term .",
    "this model allows for a crossing of the  phantom divide \" , i.e. a transition of the equation of state from @xmath0 to @xmath4 . when applied to early universe cosmology",
    ", quintom models can lead to nonsingular cosmological backgrounds which correspond to a bouncing universe @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the lee - wick standard model has similarities with the lagrangian of a quintom model : the higgs field has regular sign kinetic term but the auxiliary field has a negative sign kinetic term .",
    "thus , it is logical to expect that the lee - wick model might give rise to a cosmological bounce and thus solve the cosmological singularity problem , in addition to solving the hierarchy problem . in this paper",
    "we show that this expectation is indeed realized .",
    "given that the lee - wick model leads to a cosmological bounce , the cosmology of the very early universe may be very different from what is obtained by studying the cosmology of the standard model .",
    "it is possible to introduce a potential for the scalar field in order to obtain a sufficiently long period of inflation after the bounce in order to solve the problems of standard big bang cosmology and to obtain a spectrum of nearly scale - invariant cosmological fluctuations .",
    "however , this requires fine - tuning of the potential . on the other hand , given a bouncing cosmology it is possible that the cosmological fluctuations originate in the contracting phase , as in the pre - big - bang @xcite or ekpyrotic @xcite scenarios . in this paper , we study the generation and evolution of fluctuations in our lee - wick type model .",
    "we consider both vacuum and thermal initial conditions for the fluctuations in the contracting phase and follow the perturbations through the bounce , a process which can be done unambiguously since the bounce is non - singular .",
    "we find that initial quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase have the right spectrum to develop into a scale - invariant spectrum in the expanding phase .",
    "what is responsible for this result is the fact that there is a coupling of the growing mode in the contracting phase to the dominant ( constant in time ) mode in the expanding phase , and that this coupling scales with co - moving wave - number as @xmath5 .",
    "the lee - wick model thus leads to a concrete realization of the proposal of @xcite ( see also @xcite and more recently @xcite ) to obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations from a matter - dominated contracting phase ( see also @xcite for an analysis of gravitational wave evolution in this background ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the following section we introduce the lee - wick scalar field model which we will study in the rest of the paper . in section 3",
    "we study the background solutions of this model , taking initial conditions in the contracting phase .",
    "we show that , at least at the level of homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , it is easy to obtain a bouncing cosmology . in section 4",
    "we study how cosmological fluctuations set up in the initial contracting phase pass through the bounce .",
    "the evolution of the fluctuations is well behaved , section 5 contains the computation of the spectrum of gravitational waves , starting from quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase .",
    "we end with a discussion of our results .",
    "we will take our starting lagrangian for the scalar field @xmath6 to be = _ ^ - ( ^2 ) ^2 - m^2 ^2 - v ( ) , where @xmath7 is the mass of the scalar field and @xmath8 is its interaction potential .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side is the higher derivative term , involving a new mass scale @xmath9 .    as discussed in @xcite , by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath10 and redefining the  normal \" scalar field as = + , the lagrangian takes the form = 1 2 _ ^ - _",
    "^ + m^2 ^2 - m^2 ( - ) ^2 - v(- ) .",
    "we thus see that @xmath9 is the mass of the new scalar degree of freedom , the  lee - wick scalar \" which comes from the extra degrees of freedom of the higher derivative theory .",
    "note that both the kinetic term and the mass term of the lee - wick scalar have the opposite sign compared the signs for a regular scalar field .",
    "one may worry that the theory is unstable because of the wrong sign of the kinetic term of the lee - wick scalar @xcite .",
    "however , as was argued in @xcite , the perturbative expansion can be defined in a consistent way and the theory is unitary .",
    "building on these workds , a recent study shows that lee - wick electrodynamics can be defined consistently as a ghost - free , unitary and lorentz invariant theory @xcite .    by rotating the field basis",
    ", the mass term can be diagonalized .",
    "however , the coupling between the two fields in the interaction term remains . to be specific ,",
    "we consider a quartic interaction term .",
    "thus , the lagrangian we study is [ l3 ] l = 1 2 _ ^ - _ ^ + m^2 ^2 - m^2 ^2 - ( - ) ^4 .",
    "in this section we study the background cosmological equations which follow from coupling the matter lagrangian ( [ l3 ] ) to einstein gravity . for a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe",
    "the metric of space - time is ds^2 = dt^2 - a(t)^2 d*x*^2 , where @xmath11 is physical time , and @xmath12 denote the co - moving spatial coordinates .",
    "the system of equations of motion consists of the klein - gordon equations [ kgeq ] + 3 h + m^2 & = & - ( - ) ^3 + + 3 h + m^2 & = & - ( - ) ^3 for the two scalar fields and the einstein expansion equation [ heq ] h^2 = , where @xmath13 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath14 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "an overdot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "combining these equations leads to the following expression for the change in the hubble expansion rate [ dotheq ] h = - 4 g ( ^2 - ^2 ) .",
    "from which we immediately see that it is possible for the background cosmology to cross the  phantom divide \" @xmath15 .",
    "let us take a first look to how it is possible to obtain a bouncing cosmology in our model .",
    "we assume that the universe starts in a contracting phase and that the contribution of @xmath16 in the equations of motion dominates over that of the lee - wick scalar .",
    "this will typically be the case at low energy densities and curvatures .",
    "as the universe contracts and the energy density increases , the relative importance of @xmath10 compared to @xmath16 will grow . from ( [ heq ] )",
    "it follows that there will be a time when @xmath17 - this is a necessary condition for the bounce point . from ( [ dotheq ] )",
    "it follows that at the bounce point @xmath18 .",
    "hence , we indeed have a transition from a contracting phase to an expanding phase , i.e. a cosmological bounce .",
    "let us now consider the above argument in a bit more detail . for the moment we will set the interaction lagrangian to zero ,",
    "i.e. we will assume @xmath19 .",
    "we begin the evolution during the contracting phase when the energy density is sufficiently low so that we expect the contribution of the lee - wick scalar to the total energy density to be small . for these initial conditions ,",
    "both matter fields will be oscillating , and the equation of state will hence be that of a matter dominated universe .",
    "in fact , as follows from the klein - gordon equations ( [ kgeq ] ) which in this case reduce to + 3 h + m^2 & = & 0 + + 3 h + m^2 & = & 0 both scalar fields will be performing oscillations with amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are blue - shifting ( i.e. increasing ) at the same rate [ scaling ] a(t ) ~ ( t ) ~ a(t)^-3/2 . eventually , the oscillations of the field @xmath16 will freeze out . from studies of chaotic inflation",
    "@xcite it is well know that this happens when the amplitude @xmath22 becomes of the order of the planck mass @xmath23 , more specifically when [ freeze ] a = ( 12 ) ^-1/2 m_pl .",
    "after freeze - out , @xmath16 will slowly roll up the potential and the equation of state will shift from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denoting pressure and energy density , respectively ) leading to a deflationary phase during which the scale factor is decreasing almost exponentially .",
    "this phase is the time reversal of a period of slow - roll inflation .",
    "however , during this period the lee - wick field @xmath10 is still oscillating with rapidly increasing amplitude .",
    "hence , its contribution to the energy density will rapidly catch up to that of @xmath16 .",
    "let us give a rough estimate of the duration of the deflationary phase .",
    "it will depend crucially on the initial ratio of the energy density of the lee - wick scalar @xmath10 to that of the regular scalar @xmath16 .",
    "let us denote this ratio by @xmath26 . in the absence of coupling between the two scalar fields ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath19 , the ratio will be unchanged during the period of matter domination when both fields are oscillating . however , once @xmath16 enters the slow - rolling phase , the amplitude @xmath27 will increase exponentially according to ( [ scaling ] ) while that of @xmath16 will remain virtually unchanged .",
    "thus , the condition on the duration @xmath28 of the deflationary phase is |h| t",
    "n = log(|f|^-1 ) .",
    "thus , to obtain a deflationary phase with @xmath29 ( which in the expanding phase will correspond to a period of inflation of sufficient length to solve the cosmological problems of the standard big bang model ) required severe fine - tuning of the initial conditions . as we will discuss below , this problem may be even worse if coupling between the two fields is allowed .",
    "once the contribution of the lee - wick scalar to the energy density catches up to that of the original scalar field , the deflationary phase will end and a cosmological bounce will occur . note that once @xmath17 , the lee - wick scalar is still oscillating whereas @xmath16 is slowly rolling .",
    "thus , @xmath30 and we indeed have a transition from contraction to expansion .",
    "this is a behaviour which is not possible for einstein gravity coupled to matter satisfying the weak energy condition .",
    "however , due to the negative sign of the kinetic term in the lagrangian , the weak energy condition is violated in our model .",
    "note that in bouncing cosmologies obtained in higher derivative gravity models such as @xcite , it is the higher derivative gravitational terms which , when interpreted as matter , lead to a violation of the weak energy condition .    the duration of the bounce can be estimated as follows : the maximal amplitude @xmath31 of @xmath32 before and after the bounce is set by h_m ~ m , since it is determined by the potential energy at the field value where the slow rolling of @xmath16 begins .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath33 at the bounce , denoted by @xmath34 , can in turn be estimated by _",
    "b ~ 4 g ^2 ~ 4 g m^2 m_pl^2 ~ m^2 , where in the first step we have used the fact that the kinetic energy of @xmath16 is negligible at the bounce , and in the second step the fact that the bounce is determined by having the same absolute value of energy densities of @xmath16 and @xmath10 , and that the field value of @xmath16 at the bounce is about @xmath23 .",
    "the bounce time @xmath35 can now be determined via _",
    "b t_b = 2 h_m .",
    "this gives t_b ~ m^-1 .",
    "note from the above that the value of @xmath31 is set by the mass of @xmath16 , not the mass of @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the bounce time is determined by the mass of the original scalar field and not of its lee - wick partner .    after the bounce",
    ", the amplitude of the oscillations of the lee - wick scalar exponentially decreases while @xmath16 is now slowly rolling down the potential .",
    "this is a phase of inflation which is time - symmetric to the phase of deflation before the bounce .",
    "as we have seen , without fine - tuning of the initial contribution of the lee - wick scalar to the energy density , the period of inflation will be too small for inflation to solve the various problems of standard cosmology which inflation was invented to solve @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ( such as the horizon and flatness problems ) .",
    "let us add some comments on the effects of allowing a coupling between the two scalar fields .",
    "we expect that this will lead to a gradual flow of energy between the regular scalar and the lee - wick scalar such that at an energy density corresponding to the scale of the lee - wick scalar , the energy density in the lee - wick scalar will begin to dominate .",
    "thus , allowing for @xmath36 will lead to a shorter deflationary phase and may completely eliminate the period of deflation .",
    "complete elimination of the deflationary phase will occur if the energy density in @xmath16 is larger than @xmath37 at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "this is the case if ( making use of ( [ freeze ] ) m < ( ( 12 ) ^-1/2 m m_pl ) ^1/2 .",
    "the approximate analytical analysis summarized above is supported by exact numerical results .",
    "we have solved the coupled equations of motion for the scale factor and the two scalar fields @xmath16 and @xmath10 numerically .",
    "figure 1 presents the results in the base of a non - interacting model .",
    "we plot the time evolution of the scalar field @xmath16 ( denoted @xmath40 in the figure ) , its lee - wick partner @xmath10 ( denoted by @xmath41 ) and the equation of state parameter @xmath42 .",
    "as is evident , there is a non - singular cosmological bounce , there is no deflationary phase , but the equation of state parameter @xmath42 crosses the phantom divide around the bounce point .",
    "note that the scalar field @xmath16 stops oscillating near the bounce , whereas the lee - wick scalar continues to oscillate and therefore increases in magnitude by a large factor during the latter stages of the contracting phase ( which is why we have plotted the time evolution of @xmath10 on two different scales ) .    , @xmath10 and of the background equation of state parameter @xmath42 in a non - interacting model as a function of cosmic time ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the background fields are plotted in dimensionless units by normalizing by the mass @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , the time axis is displayed in units of @xmath44 .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 were chosen to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the initial conditions were @xmath47 . ]",
    "note that in the non - interacting model , the bounce is symmetric . in figure 2",
    "we present the corresponding figure in the case of an interacting model with the value of @xmath48 chosen to be @xmath49 . in this case , the bounce is clearly asymmetric . as a second major difference compared to the simulation of figure 1 ,",
    "the ratio of masses was chosen to be almost 100 in this case as opposed to only 2 in the first simulation .",
    "because of the large ratio of the masses ( and the corresponding initial conditions for which the energy in @xmath16 greatly dominates over than in @xmath10 ) , the background evolution enters a brief deflationary phase at the end of the contraction phase .",
    "however , due to the presence of interactions , the energy density in @xmath16 does not come to dominate again right after the bounce and hence the period of inflation which would be the time reversal of the phase of delation is absent .    , @xmath10 and of the background equation of state parameter @xmath42 in a non - interacting model as a function of cosmic time ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the background fields are plotted in dimensionless units by normalizing by the mass @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , the time axis is displayed in units of @xmath44 .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 were chosen to be @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the initial conditions were @xmath52 . ]    finally , in figure 3 we plot the number of e - foldings of the deflationary phase as a function of the ratio of @xmath53 to @xmath54 , in the model without interactions between the two scalar fields .",
    "as predicted by our analytical approximations , the scaling of the period of deflation as a function of the ratio is roughly logarithmic .     and @xmath10 ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the duration ( vertical axis ) is shown in terms of the e - folding number of deflation . ]",
    "it is useful to first consider the space - time sketch ( [ fig - st ] ) of our non - singular bouncing cosmology .",
    "we choose the bounce time to correspond to @xmath55 .",
    "long before the bounce , the equation of state is that of matter . during this period",
    ", the hubble radius is decreasing linearly and @xmath56 . at a time",
    "denoted @xmath57 ( in analogy with the notation in inflationary cosmology ) there is a transition to a period of deflation during which the hubble radius @xmath58 is constant . however , as argued in the previous section , this period will be of short duration and ends at a time @xmath59 when a brief bouncing phase covering the time interval @xmath60 begins . during this period @xmath61 . after the bouncing phase there is a short period of inflation lasting from @xmath62 to @xmath63 ,",
    "after which the universe enters a matter - dominated expansion phase with @xmath64 .     and the wavelength @xmath48 of a fluctuations with comoving wavenumber @xmath65 . ]    in figure [ fig - st ] we also plot the evolution of the physical length corresponding to a fixed co - moving scale .",
    "this scale is the wavelength of the fluctuation mode @xmath65 ( @xmath65 standing for the co - moving wavenumber ) which we want to follow .",
    "the wavelength begins in the matter - dominated phase of contraction on sub - hubble scale , exits the hubble radius during this phase at a time which we denote @xmath66 , and re - enters the hubble radius during the matter - dominated phase at the time @xmath67 .",
    "note that if the energy density at the bounce point is given by the scale @xmath68 of grand unification ( @xmath69 ) , then the physical wavelength of a perturbation mode corresponding to the current hubble radius is of the order of @xmath70 , i.e. in the far infrared . in this sense ,",
    "the evolution of fluctuations in this bouncing cosmology is free of the trans - planckian problem @xcite which effects the evolution of fluctuations in all inflationary models in which the period of inflation lasts more than about @xmath71 e - foldings ( this number assumes that the scale of inflation is of the order of grand unification ) .",
    "since our bounce is non - singular , the computation of the evolution of fluctuations is free of the matching condition ambiguities which affect the study of fluctuations in singular bouncing cosmologies such as the ekpyrotic scenario ( see @xcite for some early papers on the problem of matching fluctuations through the bounce in ekpyrotic cosmology ) .",
    "there is another important difference in the study of cosmological fluctuations between non - singular bouncing cosmologies and the inflationary scenario .",
    "it is usually argued that the exponential expansion of space during inflation red - shifts any pre - existing matter and the related matter fluctuations , leaving behind a vacuum matter state .",
    "thus , perturbations in this setup are quantum vacuum fluctuations . on the other hand , in a bouncing cosmology",
    "the fluctuations are set up at low densities and temperatures in the contracting phase .",
    "there is no mechanism that red - shifts initial classical fluctuations .",
    "thus , there is no reason to prefer vacuum over thermal initial perturbations . in the following",
    ", we will consider both choices .",
    "we begin by writing the metric including cosmological fluctuations in longitudinal gauge , assuming that there is no anisotropic stress ( see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion of the theory of cosmological perturbations and @xcite for a briefer survey ) ds^2 = a()^2 , where @xmath72 is the generalized newtonian gravitational potential which represents the metric fluctuations .",
    "it is convenient to write the equations in terms of conformal time @xmath68 defined via @xmath73 .",
    "the einstein equations linearly expanded in @xmath74 lead to the following equation of motion for the fourier mode of @xmath74 with co - moving wave - number @xmath65 : [ phieq ] ^ & + & 2 ( h - ) ^ + 2 ( h^ - h ) + k^2 + & = & 8 g ( 2 h + ) ^ where the derivative with respect to conformal time is denoted by a prime , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the fluctuation in @xmath10 . in deriving this equation ,",
    "we have assumed that the background is dominated by the field @xmath16",
    ". this will be the case except at the bounce .    in inflationary cosmology",
    ", it has proven to be convenient to use the variable @xmath77 , the curvature fluctuation in co - moving gauge , which in terms of @xmath74 is given by = + ( ^ + h ) . in any eternally expanding universe in which @xmath78 ,",
    "the variable @xmath77 is conserved on super - hubble scales in the absence of entropy fluctuations @xcite , since - neglecting terms of the order @xmath5 - the equation of motion ( [ phieq ] ) for @xmath74 is equivalent to ( 1 + w ) = 0 . when considering the quantum theory of cosmological perturbations , it is important to identify the fluctuation variable which has canonical kinetic term .",
    "it is with respect to this variable , commonly denoted by @xmath79 , that the canonical commutation relations must be imposed ( see @xcite for the quantum theory of cosmological perturbations ) .",
    "it turns out that the variable is simply related to @xmath77 v = z , where the background variable @xmath80 is the following combination of the background metric and the background matter field @xmath16 ( for simplicity we are assuming here only one matter field ) [ zdef ] z = . if the equation of state is constant in time , then @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath79 is [ veq ] v^ + v = 0 , on sub - hubble scales , it follows from ( [ veq ] ) that @xmath79 is performing harmonic oscillations as a function of conformal time . on the other hand , on super - hubble scales @xmath79",
    "is frozen in and @xmath83 .    in terms of the variable @xmath80 , the relationship between the metric fluctuation @xmath74 and the canonical field @xmath79 takes the form @xcite [ rel ] = ( ) ^ .",
    "the variable @xmath77 has proven to be a convenient variable to use in inflationary cosmology .",
    "it was therefore taken for granted that it would also be a useful variable in bouncing cosmologies , and that it would remain conserved between when the mode @xmath65 exits the hubble radius during the period of contraction at the time @xmath66 and the time @xmath67 of re - entry in the expanding phase . in the context of singular bouncing cosmologies , the hwang - vishniac @xcite ( deruelle - mukhanov @xcite ) matching conditions for fluctuations across the singularity lead to the conclusion that @xmath77 should be conserved .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the applicability of these matching conditions is questionable since the matching conditions are not satisfied by the background .",
    "non - singular bouncing cosmologies do not require ad - hoc matching conditions - the fluctuations can be followed through the bounce ( as long as their amplitude remains sufficiently small such that linear perturbation theory does not break down ) .",
    "as has recently been shown in several examples of non - singular bounces , the equation of motion for @xmath77 develops singularities around the bounce point @xcite , whereas the equation of motion for @xmath74 remains well defined .",
    "one of the reasons for the singularities in the equation of motion for @xmath77 is that the co - moving gauge has a singularity at a cosmological bounce .",
    "thus , in the following we will follow the evolution of the fluctuations in terms of @xmath74 .    if the initial fluctuations in the contracting phase are due to thermal matter , then the initial values of @xmath74 and its derivative follow from the perturbations in the energy density of matter .",
    "if , on the other hand , we assume vacuum initial fluctuations , then the initial inhomogeneities are given in terms of the canonical variable @xmath79 and the initial values of @xmath74 and @xmath84 must be induced from @xmath79 via the relation ( [ rel ] ) .",
    "let us briefly review the general solution of the equation of motion ( [ phieq ] ) for @xmath74 on super - hubble scales .",
    "we will keep the discussion quite general in this subsection and assume that the equation of state parameter is given by some @xmath42 . in this case , @xmath85 scales as a(t ) ~ t^p with p = . from the definition of conformal time @xmath68",
    "it then follows that ~ t^1 - p .",
    "the condition for the hubble radius crossing time @xmath67 for a mode with co - moving wave - number @xmath65 is a(t_h(k ) ) k^-1 = h^-1(t_h(k ) ) ~t_h(k ) . hence _",
    "h(k ) ~ k^-1 .    as is well known , one of the two modes of @xmath74 on super - hubble scales is constant , whereas the other is decaying in an expanding universe and growing in a contracting one .",
    "specifically we have ( see e.g. @xcite ) ( k , ) = d(k ) + s(k ) ^-2 , where 2 = , and where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are independent of time and carry the information about the spectra of the two modes . in the following , we will determine the spectra of these two modes for various thermal and vacuum initial conditions .",
    "here we assume that the initial fluctuations are given by thermal matter perturbations .",
    "as was done in the case of string gas cosmology @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent comprehensive review ) , we follow the matter perturbations up to hubble radius crossing and then convert to metric fluctuations by making use of the perturbed einstein constraint equation ( the time - time component of the perturbed einstein equations ) which reads [ pertee ] - 3 h ( h + ^ ) + ^2 = 4 g a^2 t^0_0 . in the above",
    ", @xmath88 is the fluctuation in the energy density , and @xmath89 is the co - moving spatial gradient . at hubble radius crossing all three terms on the left - hand side of the above equation",
    "are of the same order of magnitude . hence , modulo a constant of the order @xmath90 , the fourier space correlation function of @xmath74 becomes [ phicor ] < | ( k)|^2 > = 16 ^2 g^2 k^-4 a^4 < |t^0_0(k)|^2 > .",
    "where the pointed brackets indicate ensemble averaging .",
    "the energy density fluctuations are determined by thermodynamics .",
    "first , we express the momentum space energy density correlation function for co - moving wave - number @xmath65 in terms of the r.m.s .",
    "position space mass fluctuation [ mass ] m(r)^2 = r^3 < |t^0_0(k)|^2 > , where @xmath91 is the physical radius of the region corresponding to the wave - number @xmath65 .",
    "the mass fluctuations are determined by the specific heat capacity @xmath92 [ mass2 ] m(r)^2 = t^2 c_v ( r ) , where @xmath93 is the temperature of the system . for a gas of point particles ,",
    "the heat capacity is proportional to @xmath94 , i.e. [ specheat ] c_v ( r ) = c_v t^3 r^3 , where @xmath95 is a constant .",
    "note that this result is in agreement with the intuition that on scales larger than the thermal correlation length @xmath96 , the heat capacity scales as a random walk .    inserting ( [ mass ] ) ,",
    "( [ mass2 ] ) and ( [ specheat ] ) into ( [ phicor ] ) we obtain the following power spectrum for @xmath74 k^3 < | ( k)|^2 > = 16 ^2 g^2 k^-1 t^5 c_v .",
    "we need to evaluate this expression at hubble radius crossing @xmath67 since we will be using the corresponding value as the initial condition for the evolution of @xmath74 on super - hubble scales : [ horizon1 ] k^3 < | ( k)|^2 > ( t_h(k ) ) = 16 ^2 g^2 k^-1 t^5(t_h(k ) ) c_v .",
    "we now use ( [ horizon1 ] ) to infer the power spectra of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 modes in the case of thermal matter initial conditions .",
    "we are assuming that the initial value of @xmath74 at hubble radius crossing gets distributed equally among the two modes the power spectrum @xmath99 of the constant mode @xmath98 is the same as that of @xmath74 at hubble radius crossing p_d(k ) ~ k^-1 + where the second exponent comes from making use of t(t_h(k ) ) ~ a^-1(t_h(k ) ) ~ t_h(k)^-p ~ k^ .",

    "the key challenge for any bouncing cosmology is to control the magnitude of the inhomogeneities and to provide a mechanism for preventing the universe to collapse into a gas of black holes at the end of the phase of contraction . for an attempt to address this issue in the case of string gas cosmology see @xcite .",
    "we would like to conclude this paper by putting our work in the context of previous work on perturbations in bouncing cosmologies .",
    "the issue of the mixing of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 modes at a cosmological bounce has been hotly debated in the literature since the ekpyrotic scenario was proposed . in the case of the ekpyrotic scenario , for vacuum initial conditions",
    "the @xmath97 mode of @xmath74 inherits a scale - invariant spectrum , whereas the @xmath98 mode obtains a blue spectrum with index @xmath204 @xcite ( see also the more recent analysis of @xcite and the recent review of @xcite ) .",
    "this is also the spectrum of @xmath77 . according to the hwang - vishniac @xcite ( deruelle - mukhanov @xcite ) matching conditions applied at a hypersurface on which we glue the expanding to the contracting universe ,",
    "the mixing between the @xmath114 mode and the @xmath162 mode is suppressed by a power of @xmath5 ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of this point ) . hence , the spectrum of metric fluctuations after the bounce is not scale - invariant .",
    "the pre - big - bang scenario faces a similar problem @xcite .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed in some specific models in which the bounce was smoothed out by making use of higher derivative gravity terms ( see @xcite in the case of the pre - big - bang model and @xcite in the case of the ekpyrotic scenario ) .",
    "however , the use of the matching conditions was challenged in @xcite where it was pointed out that if the background solution does not satisfy the matching conditions at the bounce , there is no reason to expect the fluctuations to do so . in fact , in the case of the ekpyrotic scenario ( which is intrinsically a higher - dimensional cosmology ) , computations done in the higher dimensional framework yielded a successful transfer of the scale - invariant spectrum of metric fluctuations from the contracting to the expanding phase @xcite , a conclusion which was confirmed in @xcite and , in a slightly different setting , in @xcite .",
    "calculations have also been done in some other non - singular bouncing models @xcite .",
    "for example , studies done in models in which the bounce is induced by a negative energy density scalar field found no unsuppressed matching between the growing perturbation mode in the contracting phase and the constant mode in the expanding phase @xcite , in contrast to what was obtained in some initial work @xcite . both studies in models in which a bounce was generated by a curvature term in the einstein action @xcite and analyses in some other bouncing models @xcite yielded un - suppressed matching of the dominant modes of the contracting and expanding phases .",
    "it was realized that the equation of motion for @xmath77 has singularities in the case of a non - singular bounce , thus casting doubt on the belief that in all cases @xmath77 is conserved at a bounce .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath74 equation is free of such singularities and is thus a safer equation to use @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite it was shown in the case of the quintom bounce model that there is unsuppressed mixing between the @xmath162 and @xmath114 modes on length scales which are small compared to the duration of the bouncing period , whereas on longer length scales the mixing is suppressed ( but not completely absent ) . in the present work ,",
    "the bounce is short compared to the length scales we are interested in .",
    "our work shows that the evolution of fluctuations through the non - singular bounce in the lee - wick model is rather standard .",
    "there is no un - suppressed coupling between the dominant modes of the contracting and expanding phases , and @xmath77 is conserved at the bounce .    in the current paper",
    "we have not considered radiation . since the energy density in radiation increases faster than that in matter",
    ", radiation would dominate at early times .",
    "however , in the lee - wick standard model there is a lee - wick partner to each field . in particular",
    ", there is a lee - wick photon partner @xmath205 of the radiation field @xmath206 . at high energy densities , then as a consequence of interactions between @xmath206 and @xmath205 , we expect that energy will flow from @xmath206 into @xmath205 , like it flows from @xmath16 to @xmath207 in our scalar field model",
    ". then , a cosmological bounce would occur in a manner similar to how it occurs in our model .",
    "adding intermediate phases of radiation between the bouncing phase and the contracting and expanding matter phases will not change our results concerning the spectrum of fluctuations for modes which exit the hubble radius during the phase of matter domination , which are the modes we are interested in when trying to explain the large - scale structure of the universe and the cmb anisotropies .",
    "a study of these issues is left to a followup paper .",
    "note added : while this paper was being prepared for submission , a preprint appeared @xcite pointing out that the lee - wick model provides a realization of the quintom scenario and could be applied to study the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "we find it more natural to consider the corrections to the cosmological evolution which are obtained in the very early universe .",
