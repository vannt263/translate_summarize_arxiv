    "a comprehensive overview of the ion energies and the ion charge states is provided since these are important factors influencing the thin film growth conditions in plasma - based synthesis methods like cathodic arc deposition .",
    "all experiments were carried out in a vacuum chamber with a diameter of 1 m and a typical residual background pressure of 2.5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 pa . a dc arc source ( from vtd vakuumtechnik , dresden , germany ) with a cathode of a diameter of 65 mm was placed inside the vacuum chamber and operated at an arc current of 50 a during the measurements .",

    "the cathodes used for the present investigation comprised single - element al and cr cathodes as well as composite cathodes prepared by powder - metallurgical methods with al / cr atomic ratios of 75/25 , 50/50 , and 25/75 .",

    "after a conditioning time of 5 min at a constant arc current of 50 a , the iedfs were measured with a differentially pumped , combined ion energy - per - charge and mass - per - charge analyser ( eqp 300 ) .",
    "the instrument was set to measure in the energy - per - charge range from 0 to 200 ev / charge with an increment of 0.5 ev / charge for a given mass - to - charge ratio according to the positively charged ion of interest .",
    "the dwell time for each data point was 50 ms and the distance between the cathode surface and the orifice of the mass - energy analyser was 24 cm .",
    "subsequent to the measurements , the raw data were corrected for the ion charge state by multiplying the scan voltage with the charge state number and dividing the count rate by the charge state number to account for the energy bin width .",
    "no further corrections were made to account for the energy dependence of the acceptance angle and transfer function since they are not well known .",
    "the following positively charged ions were analysed : al@xmath5 , al@xmath1 , al@xmath6 , cr@xmath5 , cr@xmath1 , cr@xmath6 , ar@xmath5 , ar@xmath1 , n@xmath5 , n@xmath1 , n@xmath7 , o@xmath5 , o@xmath1 , o@xmath7 , alo@xmath5 , cro@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the negatively charged ions o@xmath8 , o@xmath9 , alo@xmath8 and cro@xmath8 were measured in the energy - per - charge range from 0 to 150 ev / charge with an increment of 0.5 ev / charge . in this case , a multiplier voltage of 2600 v was used , as compared to 1675 v in the case of the positively charged ions , in order to enhance the intensity of the recorded negative ion signal .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : ar_al - ions_iedfs ] , the dominating aluminium ion species in ar atmosphere is al@xmath5 regardless of the cathode composition or ar pressure .",
    "small fractions of al@xmath1 ions were observed in the plasma from the single - element al cathode or at a low ar pressure of 0.5 pa .",
    "the discharge from the single - element al cathode at only 0.5 pa was not stable and is , hence , not shown here .",
    "all al@xmath5 iedfs consist of thermalised ions and a high - energy part that extends up to 100 ev .",
    "as can be expected , the fraction of the thermalised ions increases with increasing ar pressure , whereas the energy of the peak in the energetic portion of the iedf decreases with decreasing al content .        in the case of chromium ions , the iedfs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ar_cr - ions_iedfs ] are similar .",
    "however , the dominating chromium ion species is cr@xmath1 in all discharge conditions studied .",
    "further , the maximum energy of the high - energy tail reaches higher values than in the case of aluminium and extends up to 150 ev ( in some cases even up to 200 ev ) .",
    "the energy of the peak in the non - thermal part of the distribution is highest for the single - element cr cathode and increases with decreasing cr content in the composite cathodes .",
    "the influence of the ar background gas is again noticed by in an increase in the fraction of thermalised ions and a decrease in the fraction of cr@xmath6 ions as the gas pressure increases .",
    "all ar@xmath5 and ar@xmath1 ions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ar_ar - ions_iedfs ] ) were all thermalised with the exception when cr - rich cathodes were used with a low ar pressure of 0.5 pa . in this case , a high - energy tail for the ar@xmath1 ions was observed with the maximum energy reaching up to 100 ev .",
    "the iedfs of the aluminium and chromium ions in n@xmath2 atmosphere ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : n2_al - ions_iedfs ] and [ fig : n2_cr - ions_iedfs ] ) are generally comparable to the iedfs in ar atmosphere .",
    "the differences include a higher fraction of multiply charged aluminium ions at low gas pressures and more pronounced high - energy tails that extend up to 200300 ev . the aluminium iedfs in the plasma from the composite cathode show a higher fraction of thermalised ions , but the reduction in the charge states with increasing n@xmath2 pressure is similar for all cathode compositions . in the case of chromium ,",
    "less cr@xmath6 were recorded in n@xmath2 than in ar atmosphere , but the cr@xmath1 ions are still the most abundant chromium ions .            a major difference was observed between the iedfs of the gas ions in ar and n@xmath2 atmospheres .",
    "three different nitrogen ions were encountered : n@xmath5 and n@xmath7 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : n2_n - ions_iedfs ] ) as well as small fractions of n@xmath1 ( not shown ) .",
    "in contrast to the argon ions , the nitrogen ions show pronounced high - energy tails , especially in the case of n@xmath5 where the maximum energy can reach values up to 100 ev .          while there are pronounced contributions in the iedfs of all aluminium ions at low o@xmath2 pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : o2_al - ions_iedfs ] ) , the number of the multiply charged aluminium ions is strongly reduced upon increasing the pressure . however , a considerable fraction of al@xmath1 ions is still present in the plasma from cr - rich cathodes at medium o@xmath2 pressures , which is in contrast to the other two atmospheres studied .",
    "apart from theses differences , the aluminium iedfs in o@xmath2 atmosphere are similar to ar and n@xmath2 atmosphere .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2_cr - ions_iedfs ] , the most abundant chromium ion in o@xmath2 is cr@xmath0 for all studied cathodes .",
    "multiply charged chromium ions were only observed at o@xmath2 pressures below 2 pa .        a major difference of the plasma properties in o@xmath2 atmosphere as compared to ar and n@xmath2 is a series of oxygen - containing molecular ions .",
    "[ fig : o2_positive - o - ions_iedfs ] and [ fig : o2_negative - o - ions_iedfs ] show atomic and molecular oxygen ions that are positively and negatively charged , respectively .",
    "while the o@xmath7 ions are mainly thermalised , the o@xmath5 ions show a pronounced high - energy tail and their number increases with increasing cr content in the cathode . at an o@xmath2 pressure of 1 pa a small fraction of o@xmath1 ions",
    "was also observed ( not shown ) .",
    "comparing the negatively charged atomic and molecular oxygen ions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : o2_negative - o - ions_iedfs ] ) , a similar behaviour as in the case of the positively charged ions can be noticed .",
    "the maximum energy in the iedfs of the o@xmath8 ions reaches values of up to 50 ev , in few cases even 100 ev .",
    "however , as an estimate based on the integrated ion counts ( recorded at a constant multiplier voltage ) over all energies , only about 1% of the oxygen - containing ions in the plasma are negatively charged .",
    "an interesting feature of the oxygen - containing plasma from the alcr cathodes are the metal oxide ions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2_positive - meo - ions_iedfs ] .",
    "the alo@xmath5 ions are mainly formed in the plasma from the composite cathodes and their energy distribution shows that they are thermalised .",
    "in contrast , cro@xmath5 are present in a higher number and the maximum energy in their iedfs can reach up to 50 ev . at an o@xmath10 pressure of 1 pa traces of alo@xmath8 ions",
    "were also noticed ( not shown ) , whereas cro@xmath8 ions were absent in the entire o@xmath10 pressure range studied .",
    "as mentioned above , the intention of the current work is to provide a comprehensive overview of the arc plasma properties from alcr cathodes in different atmospheres . however ,",
    "emphasis in the discussion of the results is given to general trends over specific details or effects observed in subsets of the data .",
    "the effects observed regarding the ion charge states are similar to our previous work on the pulsed arc plasma from alcr cathodes @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion about factors influencing the evolution of the ion charge states can be found there . here , a short summary will be given , mainly pointing out differences in the results from the discharge conditions used .",
    "in general , the icsds are altered due to a convolution of effects associated with the background gas and the cathode composition .",
    "the influence of the cathode composition is less pronounced and better visible at low gas pressures close to high vacuum .",
    "the aluminium charge states are basically independent of the cathode composition , whereas the chromium charge states are reduced when al is added to the cathode .",
    "however , with increasing gas pressure the fraction of all multiply charged ions is reduced due to charge exchange collisions @xcite .",
    "this reduction is similar in ar and n@xmath2 atmospheres indicating that poisoning effects are without strong influence on the charge states in n@xmath2 atmosphere . in o@xmath2 atmosphere ,",
    "the aluminium charge states are similar to the other atmospheres studied , but the multiply charged chromium ions are almost completely lost .",
    "this points towards a pronounced , yet selective influence of cathode poisoning on the ion charge states in o@xmath2 atmosphere .",
    "a major difference between our previous @xcite and the current work is due to the ionisation of the background gas . in the employed dc arc source , a magnetic field",
    "is used to steer the cathode spot along a circular erosion track .",
    "steering of the cathode spot is typically applied to accelerate the cathode spot motion which in turn results in a reduced emission of macroparticles that can cause detrimental effects if incorporated into the growing film @xcite .",
    "however , in the current case , the presence of a magnetic field causes a significant ionisation of the background gas as reported by oks _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in all atmospheres",
    "used within this work , mainly single - charged atomic and molecular gas ions were observed . in the case of o@xmath2 atmosphere ,",
    "single - charged alo@xmath5 and cro@xmath5 ions were noticed in addition as well as negatively charged oxygen and oxygen - containing ions .      in general , the energy gain of the ions in cathodic arc plasmas is due to the adiabatic expansion of the plasma plume from the m - sized cathode spot into the vacuum chamber @xcite .",
    "this results in an ion velocity almost independent of the charge state for a given cathode material @xcite . in the case of alloy or composite cathodes , the ion velocity is also independent of the element as pointed out by zhirkov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . due to",
    "the different mass of the elements , the ( kinetic ) energy distributions differ from one another .",
    "this so - called velocity rule appears also to be valid for the here - studied alcr cathodes at low pressures where a distinct peak ( with higher energy than thermalised ions ) in the iedfs can be determined and the most probable velocity calculated .",
    "however , the absolute value of this velocity is affected by processes within the cathode spot , i.e.  at the interface between cathode surface and plasma region . the so - called _ cohesive energy rule _ relating the cathode material properties to the plasma properties has been established for single - element cathodes @xcite . in the case of alloy or composite cathodes",
    ", the frequent heating and cooling of the near - surface region due to the travelling cathode spot typically results in the formation of a series of compounds , in the present case intermetallics , nitrides and oxides , which complicates a direct relation between the cathode material and plasma properties .",
    "the abovementioned effects are valid for vacuum or low pressure conditions with mean free paths exceeding the vacuum system dimensions .",
    "however , the most apparent result regarding the ion energies is the reduction of high - energy ions when the gas pressure is increased .",
    "the increased probability for collisions at higher gas pressures results in a slow - down of the ions and , hence , in an increase in the number of thermalised ions as it was described , e.g. , for ti@xmath5 ions in a filtered cathodic arc plasma in @xcite .",
    "this effect appears to be independent of the charge state as , e.g. , the iedfs of both cr@xmath0 and cr@xmath1 in ar as well as n@xmath2 atmosphere show pronounced contributions from thermalised ions at pressures exceeding 2 pa .",
    "in addition to the reduction in energy , the absolute number of aluminium and chromium ions also decreases when the gas pressure is increased .",
    "this affects the film growth conditions especially if a bias voltage is applied to the substrate , which is common practice in the deposition of thin films and coatings using cathodic arcs .",
    "a reduced number of available ions at higher pressure results in a reduced ion bombardment of the growing film and a reduced charge state is also important because the ion charge state number is a multiplier between applied substrate voltage and resulting energy .      when analysing the iedfs of the gas atomic and molecular ions , their shape can be interpreted with respect of the origin of the ions , in particular the ions with high energy .",
    "there are two different processes imaginable how these ions can gain high energy . on the one hand , they can get accelerated during the expansion of the plasma plume from the cathode spot , i.e.  the energy gain is equal to the metal ions from the cathode material .",
    "on the other hand , gas atomic and molecular ions can gain energy by momentum transfer in collisions with fast metal ions .",
    "both processes will be discussed briefly in the following taking into account the results obtained .    at low n@xmath2 and o@xmath2 pressure ,",
    "the iedfs of n@xmath5 and o@xmath5 , respectively , have a shape similar to the iedfs of the respective aluminium and chromium ions .",
    "the peak in the energy distributions between 15 and 30 ev corresponds to the abovementioned most probable velocity for these ions .",
    "this indicates that the ions were formed in the cathode spot and then accelerated as the plasma cloud expanded .",
    "most likely , the ions originate from atoms or molecules that were attached to the cathode surface prior to the ignition of the plasma in the cathode spot and then were ionised .",
    "gas atoms and molecules can attach to the cathode surface by physisorption or chemisorption .",
    "the latter case , where chemical bonds are formed between the gas particles and the cathode material , is known as cathode poisoning .",
    "another contribution to the iedfs is due to thermalised ions having energies below 10 ev . such ions are formed in the already extended plasma cloud or were slowed down after a series of collisions with other ions or atoms .",
    "the iedfs of the measured ar@xmath0 and ar@xmath1 as well as n@xmath7 and o@xmath7 ions mainly show thermalised ions even at low gas pressures indicating that these ions were formed after the plasma plume expanded from the cathode spot . in the case of argon , a noble gas , atoms do not adsorb to the surface of the cathodes in great quantity .",
    "therefore , ionisation of argon atoms mainly occurs in the expanded plasma cloud where they are not subject to acceleration mechanisms associated with the strong pressure gradients of the cathode spot . in the case of molecular n@xmath7 and o@xmath7 ions , one should keep in mind that a layer of oxide or nitride , depending on the gas present , will be eroded by the action of the cathode spot . the high power density in and near the cathode spot leads to removal of material from the cathode in the form of atoms and , most likely , atomic ions , not molecules .",
    "should molecules be present they would be dissociated . at distances large",
    "compared to the size of the spot , molecules could form but they are not in the region of strong gradients , hence their acceleration is small .",
    "this explains the lack of a high - energy fraction of these molecular ions .",
    "mainly low - energy , thermalised ions were also recorded in the case of alo@xmath5 ions , whereas the iedfs of the cro@xmath5 ions show a notable high - energy tail indicating that some cro@xmath5 ions are formed relatively close to the cathode spot .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the abovementioned effect that cathode poisoning in o@xmath2 atmosphere mainly affects the chromium ions .",
    "it seems that oxygen atoms preferentially attach to chromium in the composite cathodes and , hence , the ions get accelerated in the cathode spot plasma expansion the same way metal ions get accelerated .",
    "similar considerations as for the gas atomic and molecular ions can be done for the negatively charged oxygen ions . in the cathodic arc plasma",
    "the cathode fall potential drop is up to a few 10 v and , therefore , generally causes only a weak acceleration of negatively charged particles .",
    "this situation is in contrast to magnetron sputtering plasmas where negatively charged oxygen ions of a few 100 ev can be observed due to the high potential drop in the cathode fall ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . while the iedfs of o@xmath11 show mainly contributions from thermalised ions , the iedfs of o@xmath8 extend to 50 ev ( in some cases even up to 100 ev ) .",
    "the appearance of such high ion energies can be understood by the fact that these ions were also accelerated in the plasma plume expansion , even though acceleration of negatively charged ions during fluctuations of the cathode fall potential drop , i.e.  when the voltage is transiently higher than the average value , can not be excluded completely .",
    "however , the overall number of negatively charged oxygen ions is small with only about 1% of the entire oxygen - containing ions observed and the effect on film growth is therefore expected to be insignificant .",
    "from the comprehensive overview of the ion energies in the cathodic arc plasma of composite alcr cathodes several conclusions can be drawn . as expected , and in agreement with the vast literature on arc plasmas , multiply charged ions were encountered . however , al@xmath5 was the most abundant aluminium ion in all studied atmospheres from 0.5 to 3.5 pa of ar , n@xmath2 , and o@xmath2 , whereas cr@xmath1 was the dominanting chromium ion in ar and n@xmath2 . the fact that cr@xmath5 was the most abundant chromium ion in o@xmath2 atmosphere is most likely related to cathode poisoning effects , i.e.  the formation of oxide phases on the cathode surface .    in terms of ion energy , high - energy tails were recorded in the ion energy distribution functions of aluminium and chromium ions as well as n@xmath5 and o@xmath5 ions .",
    "high ion energies originate from acceleration of the cathode spot plasma during expansion into the vacuum chamber . with increasing background gas pressure",
    "more collisions occur in the plasma cloud resulting in a slow - down of the ions and an increase of the fraction of thermalised ions having an energy of a few ev .",
    "this process occurred for all gas species used .",
    "in o@xmath2 atmosphere , negatively charged oxygen and oxygen - containing ions were observed in addition to the otherwise positively charged metal and gas ions .",
    "these ions make up a fraction of about 1% of all oxygen and oxygen - containing ions .",
    "their energy distributions typically extend up to 50 ev indicating an acceleration of these ions in the expansion of the plasma plume with a possible contribution of acceleration by the cathode fall voltage , which is known to be low but fluctuating .",

    "<S> the energy distribution functions of ions in the cathodic arc plasma using composite alcr cathodes were measured as a function of the background gas pressure in the range 0.5 to 3.5 pa for different cathode compositions and gas atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> the most abundant aluminium ions were al@xmath0 regardless of the background gas species , whereas cr@xmath1 ions were dominating in ar and n@xmath2 and cr@xmath0 in o@xmath2 atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distributions of the aluminium and chromium ions typically consisted of a high - energy fraction due to acceleration in the expanding plasma plume from the cathode spot and thermalised ions that were subjected to collisions in the plasma cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of the latter increased with increasing background gas pressure . </S>",
    "<S> atomic nitrogen and oxygen ions showed similar energy distributions as the aluminium and chromium ions , whereas the argon and molecular nitrogen and oxygen ions were formed at greater distance from the cathode spot and thus less subject to accelerating gradients . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the positively charged metal and gas ions , negatively charged oxygen and oxygen - containing ions were observed in o@xmath2 atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the ion energies and charge states in the arc plasma of alcr composite cathodes in different gas atmospheres as such plasmas are frequently used to deposit thin films and coatings .    </S>",
