    "authenticity is one of the fundamental components in cryptography and information security .",
    "typically , communicating parties would like to be assured of the authenticity of information they obtain via potentially insecure channels .",
    "concerning unconditional ( theoretical ) authenticity , authentication codes can be used to minimize the possibility of an undetected deception .",
    "their initial study appears to be that of gilbert , macwilliams & sloane  @xcite .",
    "a more general and systematic theory of authenticity was developed by simmons@xcite .",
    "we primarily focus on authentication codes with splitting in this paper .",
    "in such a code , several messages can be used to communicate a particular plaintext ( _ non - deterministic encoding _ ) .",
    "this concept plays an important role , for instance , in the context of authentication codes that permit arbitration ( see , for example ,  @xcite )",
    ". we will deal with splitting authentication codes from a combinatorial point of view . by studying the aspect of multi - fold security ,",
    "we obtain several natural generalizations of results on splitting authentication codes . as the two primary results",

    "brickell  @xcite and simmons  @xcite have established a combinatorial lower bound on the number of encoding rules .",

    "@xcite introduced splitting balanced incomplete block designs ( bibds ) .",
    "they proved basic necessary conditions for their existence and derived a fisher - type inequality .",
    "furthermore , they established an equivalence between splitting bibds and optimal one - fold secure splitting authentication codes .",
    "we will extend the notion of splitting bibds to splitting .",
    "comprehensive necessary conditions regarding their existence will be given .",
    "moreover , we will prove an equivalence between splitting and optimal secure splitting authentication codes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ splittingauthenticationcodes ] ,",
    "we give the definition and concept of multi - fold secure splitting authentication codes .",
    "we introduce splitting designs and prove basic necessary conditions for their existence in section  [ splittingdesigns ] .",
    "with respect to our further purposes , we summarize in section  [ authentication codes without splitting ] the state - of - the - art for authentication codes without splitting . in section  [ combinatorialboundsforsplittingauthenticationcodes ] , lower bounds on deception probabilities and the number of encoding rules",
    "are established for multi - fold secure splitting authentication codes .",
    "a combinatorial characterization of optimal multi - fold secure splitting authentication codes in terms of splitting designs is given in section  [ combinatorialcharacterizationsofsplittingauthenticationcodes ] .",
    "we finally conclude the paper and propose further research problems in section  [ conclusion ] .",

    "these codes are useful , inter alia , for the analysis of authentication codes with arbitration . in particular",
    ",  @xcite gives an equivalence between splitting authentication codes and authentication codes with arbitration .",
    "we use the unconditional ( theoretical ) secure authentication model developed by simmons ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our notation follows , for the most part , that of  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "three participants are involved : a _ transmitter _ , a _ receiver _ , and an _ opponent_. the transmitter wants to communicate information to the receiver via a public communications channel .",
    "the receiver in return would like to be confident that any received information actually came from the transmitter and not from some opponent ( _ integrity _ of information ) .",
    "the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to trust each other .",

    "the transmitter encrypts a source state @xmath5 to obtain the message @xmath6 to be sent over the channel .",
    "the encoding rule is communicated to the receiver via a secure channel prior to any messages being sent . when it is possible that more than one message can be used to communicate a particular source state @xmath5 under the same encoding rule @xmath4 , then the authentication code is said to have _",

    "we note that an authentication code can be represented algebraically by a @xmath27__-encoding matrix _ _ with the rows indexed by the encoding rules @xmath13 , the columns indexed by the source states @xmath5 , and the entries defined by @xmath28 . as a simple example",
