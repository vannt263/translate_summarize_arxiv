    "in standard scenarios of structure formation , dark matter haloes grow hierarchically from initially small , gaussian fluctuations . properties of haloes can be studied in great detail using both n - body simulations and analytic models .",
    "the remarkably useful extended press - schechter ( eps ) theory predicts halo mass functions ( press & schechter 1974 ; bond 1991 ) , merging histories ( lacey & cole 1993 ; sheth & lemson 1999b ; van den bosch 2002 ; neistein , van den bosch & dekel 2006 ) and spatial clustering ( mo & white 1996 ; mo , jing & white 1997 ; catelan 1998 ; sheth & lemson 1999a ) that are in reasonable agreement with the simulations .",
    "this analytic approach is based on the spherical collapse model ( gunn & gott 1972 ) . in this lagrangian approximation , haloes are identified in the initial conditions and a single parameter , the initial density contrast , is needed to characterise their epoch of formation ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "the collapse of a halo occurs when the linear density reaches a critical threshold .",
    "the fundamental properties of dark matter haloes are then obtained from the statistics of trajectories of the linear density field as a function of the smoothing scale ( e.g. bower 1991 ; bond 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ; kitayama & suto 1996 ; sheth & van de weygaert 2004 ) .",
    "although this spherical approximation works well until the first orbit crossing , it may not be accurate since perturbations in gaussian density fields are inherently triaxial ( doroshkevich 1970 ; bardeen 1986 ; jing & suto 2002 ) . furthermore , the initial shear field rather than the density has been shown to play a crucial role in the formation of nonlinear structures ( e.g. hoffman 1986 , 1988 ; peebles 1990 ; dubinski 1992 ; bertschinger & jain 1994 ; audit & alimi 1996 ; audit , teyssier & alimi 1997 ) .    unlike the spherical model whose dynamics depends on a single parameter only ( the density ) , the ellipsoidal model that follows the evolution of triaxial perturbations can be used to ascertain the influence of the ( external ) tidal shear on the properties of collapsed regions .",
    "the gravitational collapse of homogeneous ellipsoids has been investigated by numerous authors over the past decades ( e.g. lynden - bell 1964 ; lin , mestel & shu 1965 ; fujimoto 1968 ; zeldovich 1970 ; icke 1973 ; white & silk 1979 ; barrow & silk 1981 ; lemson 1993 ; eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; hui & bertschinger 1996 ) .",
    "in the formulation of bond & myers ( 1996 ) , initial conditions and external tides are chosen to recover the zeldovich approximation in the linear regime .",
    "the dynamic of ellipsoidal collapse can be incorporated in various ways in the press - schechter formalism to predict the properties of haloes ( monaco 1995 , 1997a , 1997b ; lee & shandarin 1998 ; chiueh & lee 2001 ; sheth & tormen 2002 ) . as pointed out by sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 )",
    ", the inclusion of non - sphericity in the dynamics introduces a simple dependence of the critical collapse density on the halo mass . the resulting first crossing distribution yields a better fit to the halo mass functions measured in n - body simulation ( sheth & tormen 2002 ) .",
    "however , other modifications to the original excursion set approach , such as the inclusion of non - radial degrees of freedom , might also improve the theoretical mass function ( audit 1997 ; del popolo & gambera 1998 ) .",
    "it would thus be very desirable to identify additional distinctive predictions of the ellipsoidal collapse model beyond the mass function and bias to further test this theory .",
    "while earlier numerical studies have not provided any conclusive evidence for a dependence of halo properties on environment ( lemson & kauffmann 1999 ; percival 2003 ; zentner 2005 ) , recent numerical investigations indicate that , at fixed halo mass , haloes in dense regions form at ( slightly ) higher redshift than in low density environments ( sheth & tormen 2004 ; avila - reese 2005 ; harker 2005 ) . using the millennium run ( springel 2005 ) , gao , springel & white ( 2005 )",
    "have convincingly shown that the clustering of haloes of a fixed mass depends on formation time .",
    "this dependence is strong for haloes with mass less than the typical collapsing mass @xmath2 , and fades rapidly for @xmath1 .",
    "subsequent studies have demonstrated that many other halo properties , such as spin parameter or concentration , correlate with the halo assembly history ( maulbetsch 2006 ; wechsler 2006 ; zhu 2006 ; gao & white 2007 ; wetzel 2007 ; jing , suto & mo 2007 ) .",
    "also , haloes that have undergone major mergers may be more strongly clustered relative to other haloes of the same mass ( e.g. furlanetto & kamionkowski 2006 ) .",
    "these results call into question the simplest descriptions of structure formation based on the statistics of random walks ( bond 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; white 1996 ) .",
    "however , relaxing the assumption of sphericity and/or sharp @xmath3-space filtering can introduce a dependence on environment ( bond 1991 ; white 1996 ; sandvik 2007 ) . in the ellipsoidal model , the time required for a given overdensity to virialize increases monotonically with the initial shear ( sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , as recognised by wang , mo & jing ( 2006 ) , the ellipsoidal dynamics should give an environmental effect owing to the tidal field generated by the large scale environment .",
    "in the present paper , we take an analytic approach and assess whether the ellipsoidal collapse model can produce an environmental dependence ( also termed assembly bias ) similar to that seen in n - body simulations .",
    "we start with the statistical dependence that arises in correlated ( gaussian ) initial conditions .",
    "we extend the results of doroshkevich ( 1970 ) to the joint statistics of the shear tensor . we derive conditional distributions and quantify the extent to which the asymmetry of initially triaxial perturbations is sensitive to the geometry of the large scale environment",
    "next , we investigate the dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model that takes into account the interaction between a triaxial protohalo and its environment .",
    "we find that the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass distribution affects the axes collapse and causes haloes embedded in large overdensities to virialize earlier . a moving barrier whose shape depends on the environment density provides a good description of this environmental effect .",
    "this enables us to apply the eps formalism in order to estimate the environmental dependence of halo properties .",
    "our approach thus is very different than the multidimensional extension presented in sandvik ( 2007 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . section  [ sec : background ] briefly reviews the basic concepts associated with the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "section   [ sec : ics ] is devoted to the statistical correlation between the local properties of the shear and the large scale environment ( appendix  [ app : so3 ] details a delicate step of the calculation ) . ",
    "[ sec : collapse ] investigates the dynamical origin of the environmental dependence , focusing on the distribution of halo formation redshift , large scale bias and alignment of spin parameter .",
    "non - markovianess and tidal interactions as potential sources of environmental dependence are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a final section summarises our results .",
    "we emphasise the role played by the shear in current theories of structure formation and introduce the basic definitions and relations relevant to the study of environmental effects in the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "the comoving eulerian position of a particle can be generally expressed as a mapping @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lagrangian ( initial ) position and @xmath6 is the displacement field . in the zeldovich approximation ( 1970 ) , the displacement field is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the perturbation potential ( @xmath9 is the newtonian gravitational potential ) , @xmath10 is the average matter density and @xmath11 is the linear growth factor ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the second derivatives of the perturbation potential define the deformation tensor ( or strain field ) @xmath12 . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the real , symmetric tensor @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the rms variance of density fluctuations smoothed on scale @xmath15 ( see   [ sub : joint ] below ) .",
    "we will henceforth refer to @xmath16 as the shear tensor .",
    "let @xmath17 designate the ordered eigenvalues of @xmath16 .",
    "an important quantity is the probability distribution of the ordered set @xmath18 , first derived for gaussian random fields by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vandermonde determinant in the arguments @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the elementary symmetric functions of degree @xmath23 ( weyl 1948 ) . for three variables @xmath24 ,",
    "the first few elementary functions are @xmath25 if @xmath26 are the eigenvalues of a matrix @xmath27 , the functions @xmath22 can be written in terms of the traces of power of @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , @xmath30 $ ] etc .",
    "as shown by bond , kofman & pogosyan ( 1996 ) , the filamentary pattern seen in n - body simulations ( e.g. park 1990 ; bertschinger & gelb 1991 ; cen & ostriker 1993 ; springel 2005 for a recent example ) is a consequence of the initial spatial coherence of the shear tensor . in this cosmic web paradigm ,",
    "the correspondence between large scale structures in the evolved density field and local properties of the shear tensor in the initial conditions , and the knowledge of the probability @xmath31 , allows us estimate the morphology of the large scale matter distribution .",
    "the geometry of the primeval density field depends on the signature of the ordered sequence of shear eigenvalues .",
    "if , in a given region , the largest eigenvalue only is positive ( @xmath32 ) , there is contraction along one direction and expansion in the other two so that a pancake will form .",
    "if two eigenvalues are positive while the third one is negative ( @xmath33 ) , collapse occurs along two directions and a filament will form .",
    "the probability for these two configurations , @xmath34 , is much larger than the probability that all three eigenvalues are positive , @xmath35 .",
    "however , these values depend strongly on the density enhancement of the region under consideration . while filaments or sheet - like configurations are favoured when @xmath36 , one encounters predominantly spherical - like mass concentrations above @xmath37 ( e.g. bernardeau 1994 ; pogosyan 1998 ) .",
    "note that several methods have recently been proposed to quantify precisely the geometry and topology of density fields ( e.g. sahni 1998 ; colombi , pogosyan & souradeep 2000 ; hanami 2001 ; novikov , colombi & dor 2006 ; gleser 2006 ; aragn - calvo 2007a ) .",
    "the sequence in which these structures form is still an open problem .",
    "we briefly note that , in the pancake picture , the collapse proceeds in the order pancakes - filaments - clusters ( lin , mestel & shu 1965 ; zeldovich 1970 ; arnold , shandarin & zeldovich 1982 ) . supporting evidence comes from several n - body simulations showing first pancake - like collapse ( e.g. shandarin 1995 ) .",
    "identifying the precursors of haloes ( protohaloes ) in the initial conditions is another unresolved issue , despite the major advance made in the analysis of ( gaussian ) random fields ( doroshkevich 1970 ; adler 1981 ; peacock & heavens 1985 ; bardeen 1986 ; bond & myers 1996 ) .",
    "shandarin & klypin ( 1984 ) have shown by means of simulations that massive clusters with @xmath38 are initially located close to local maxima of the smallest eigenvalue , with @xmath39 . on the other hand , recent n - body investigation ( porciani , dekel & hoffman 2002a , b ) indicate that a large fraction of small mass haloes @xmath40 are rather associated with primeval configurations of signature ( @xmath33 ) . since , at present , there is no reliable alternative to the press - schechter prescription , we assume that haloes form out of initially spherical patches of size @xmath15 , so that the relevant averages are taken over spherical lagrangian regions .",
    "this assumption is quite unrealistic in the light of numerical results , but it greatly facilitates the calculation",
    ". we shall also adopt the usual critical density criterion issued from the spherical collapse ( see below ) .",
    "this restrictive collapse condition does not guarantee a strictly positive signature ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "but in the ellipsoidal collapse model , the formation of a bound object can occur even if @xmath42  : once the shortest axis has collapsed , the nonlinear density causes the other two axes to collapse very rapidly ( bond & myers 1996 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath43 can be equivalently parametrised in terms of the shear ellipticity @xmath44 and prolateness @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the density contrast of the region under consideration .",

    "the critical density threshold @xmath68 is always larger than the spherical value @xmath66 and is very sensitive to the initial shear ( sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ) .",
    "the statistics of the shear tensor for gaussian random fields has been pioneered by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) to study the formation of large scale structures . in his seminal paper ,",
    "doroshkevich calculated the probability distribution of the shear eigenvalues and ascertained the amount of material being incorporated in a pancake .",
    "later , doroshkevich & shandarin ( 1978 ) reexamined the formation of sheet - like structures and derived a distribution function for the largest eigenvalue of the shear tensor .",
    "recently , lee & shandarin ( 1998 ) computed conditional probability distributions for individual shear eigenvalues to obtain an analytic approximation to the halo mass function .    here ,",
    "we derive expressions for a number of joint statistics of the shear tensor upon the assumption of gaussianity .",
    "this enables us to quantify the importance of the statistical correlation between the asphericity of triaxial collapsing regions and the shape of their large scale environment .",

    "the configuration shape of the large scale region is either a proto - cluster of signature ( @xmath41 ) , the precursor of a filament @xmath227 , or a sheet - like structure @xmath228 .",
    "clearly , at fixed halo mass @xmath229 , the protohaloes that collapse within the pancake or the filament are initially more asymmetric than those that will form in the spherical - like region .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetry increases noticeably with decreasing halo mass . for @xmath230 , the most probable values of @xmath195 and @xmath196",

    "since the density contrast is independent of the shear ellipticity and prolateness , the probability of finding a virialized halo in a given environment of initial shape @xmath198 is modulated by @xmath237 , which is very sensitive to @xmath87 . for the low mass halo considered here , this probability is 0.38 , 0.31 and 0.17 for the cluster , filament and pancake configurations , respectively . for the massive protohalo however , @xmath237 is significantly nonzero ( 0.10 ) for the spherical - like environment solely .",
    "thus , low mass haloes form in the mildly overdense structures of the primeval density field , while the most massive collapse mainly in the densest , weakly aspherical regions .",

    "however , the alignment is substantially stronger in the case of the filamentary structure ( middle panels ) .",
    "this mostly follows from the fact that , for a configuration shape with one or two positive eigenvalues , the alignment is strongest along the axis of symmetry , which coincides with the minor axis for a filamentary structure .",
    "conversely , the alignment between the major axes is much stronger in the pancake configuration .",
    "these results show that the principal axis frame of the tidal tensor smoothed on the protohalo mass scale can not be assumed independent of that defined by the environment .",

    "this is the reason why the formation redshift of massive haloes is nearly insensitive to @xmath306 .",
    "by contrast , random walks associated to small mass haloes @xmath0 cross the collapse boundary @xmath380 at relatively larger values of @xmath56 and thus induce a stronger environment effect . for @xmath381",

    "the former contributes about two thirds of the environmental effect ( see   [ sub : bshape ] for more details ) .    to allow for a direct comparison of our results with the analyses of n - body simulations , we need to express the environmental dependence of halo formation redshift in terms of the evolved eulerian density .",
    "mo & white ( 1996 ) and sheth ( 1998 ) have shown how this may be accomplished within the spherical collapse model .",

    "we should also take into account the triaxiality of the large scale environment in the conversion of @xmath387 into @xmath306 .",
    "henceforth however , we will neglect these complications and use the spherical approximation to relate the lagrangian density to the eulerian density at @xmath65 .",

    ", the statistical correlation induces an effect greater for low mass haloes @xmath398 while , for @xmath399 , the offset in median formation redshift is barely discernible .",
    "in addition , the difference is of the magnitude seen in n - body simulations , where @xmath400 at @xmath401 for a large scale overdensity varying in that same range ( harker 2006 ) . on the other hand",
    ", our model predicts that haloes in denser regions have a lower formation redshift than those in less dense regions .",
    "this is opposite to the behaviour reported by harker ( 2006 ) , who find that , in overdense regions , haloes in the densest environment assemble earliest .",
    "a better treatment of the relation between lagrangian and eulerian regions should not affect these conclusions .",
    "interestingly , however , these authors find that , in the most underdense regions @xmath402 , the average formation redshift increases with decreasing environment density . despite the small number of haloes and the large scatter in formation redshift , the trend is robust , yet smaller than the effects present in the high density regions ( geraint harker , private communication ) .",
    "this may be a manifestation of the environmental dependence discussed here .      having established a correlation between formation redshift and environment density",
    ", we now turn to the age - dependence of the halo bias .",
    "mo & white ( 1996 ) and sheth & tormen ( 1999c ) have shown that there is a direct relation between the halo bias and the shape of the collapse barrier .",

    "the bias is roughly 10 per cent larger for the haloes residing in the most underdense region @xmath407 .    to compare our results as directly as possible with those of gao , springel & white ( 2005 )",
    ", it would be useful to estimate the bias factors of haloes which lie in the upper and lower tail of the formation redshift distribution . in practice",
    ", however , such a calculation proves difficult in the eps formalism .",
    "instead we will consider a simpler approach motivated by the relation between barrier height and median formation redshift .",
    "we have so far neglected the presence of stochasticity in critical collapse densities . in this respect ,",
    "[ fig : dcoll2 ] shows that , at fixed environment density , there is a fairly large scatter in @xmath68 . to estimate the importance of this scatter in the bias",
    ", we will also compute @xmath405 for the barriers that bound the locus traced out by the random realisations when the environment density varies in the range @xmath406 ( i.e. a lagrangian density @xmath408 ) .",

    "they induce a formation redshift distribution strongly biased towards the extremes . for @xmath409 , the median formation redshift associated to the upper barrier",
    "is larger by @xmath410 than the value obtained from the lower barrier .",
    "we use these barriers to define our old ( high @xmath370 ) and young ( low @xmath370 ) haloes .",
    "of course , this is a crude approximation to the 10 ( 20 ) per cent tails considered by gao ( 2005 ) , but we have not found any better alternative .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] , we show the resultant bias relations as the solid curves labelled by low @xmath370 and high @xmath370. the relative bias of our old versus young haloes increases smoothly with decreasing halo mass .",
    "the effect becomes large for @xmath411 because of the considerably stronger dependence of the barrier shape on the peak height . in this regime ,",
    "the large scale bias of the old haloes is @xmath41250 per cent larger than for the young ones , an increase roughly twice as small as seen in the simulations .",
    "overall , the behaviour is similar to that reported in gao ( 2005 ) , where the correlation between halo clustering and formation history is strong for haloes less massive than @xmath2 only .",
    "a better modelling of the properties of haloes lying in the tails of the formation redshift distribution is required to make a more quantitative comparison between our predictions and the measurements of gao ( 2005 ) .",
    "the point of the present analysis is to show that the moving barrier ( [ eq : barrier1 ] ) could lead to a correlation similar to that seen in n - body simulations if the scatter in collapse density is taken into account .",
    "in contrast to the behaviour seen in n - body simulations , the predicted bias @xmath405 decreases with increasing environment density , reflecting the flattening of the barrier shape for large values of @xmath306 . in the limit @xmath413 , @xmath405 tends towards the value predicted by the spherical collapse . since",
    ", on average , dense regions at the present time formed from relatively dense regions in the primeval fluctuation field , an anti - correlation between halo bias and large scale eulerian density is expected in our model .",
    "this seems at first surprising but , as recognised by abbas & sheth ( 2007 ) , the large scale bias is not necessarily a monotonically increasing function of environment density .",
    "their results strongly suggest that haloes in extremely underdense environment are more clustered than the mean .",
    "the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath414 measures the amount of rigid rotation acquired by the triaxial perturbation before virialization .",
    "it is defined as ( peebles 1969 ) @xmath415 where @xmath416 is the halo angular momentum , @xmath417 is a unit vector , and @xmath418 , @xmath371 are the total energy and mass of the ellipsoid , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath419 and @xmath420 can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements @xmath421 ( peebles 1980 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; eisenstein & loeb 1995 ) . in general , the energy @xmath420 of the collapsing region is not conserved , notably because the kinetic energy of the ellipsoid is altered when an axis collapses . for simplicity , we use the last value of the energy before the first axis collapses in the calculation of @xmath422 ( eisenstein & loeb 2005 ) .",
    "this is a good approximation as the change in total energy is usually small during the collapse .",
    "note also that the resulting error should be relatively small because @xmath139 depends on @xmath423 solely .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] illustrates the effect of including the correlation between the initial orientation of the protohalo and its large scale environment on the probability distribution @xmath424 of the spin parameter .",
    "the left histogram shows @xmath424 when the correlation in the initial alignment is included , the right histogram when statistical independence is assumed .",
    "the distributions were drawn from @xmath425 monte - carlo realizations of the initial conditions .",
    "clearly , the inclusion of correlations in the alignment of the principal axes has a strong impact on @xmath424  : it lowers the median spin by @xmath426 per cent . as pointed out by several authors",
    "( steinmetz & bartelmann 1994 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ; see also hoffman 1988 ) , the assumption of random relative orientations overestimates the growth of angular momentum because , if the principal axis frames tend to be partially aligned , the angular momentum gain is reduced .",
    "[ fig : spin ] confirms that the correlation in the primeval alignment is an important factor , in agreement with the analysis of lee & pen ( 2001 ) .",
    "our median spin value is @xmath427 , an order of magnitude lower than those found in numerical simulations , where @xmath428 for haloes of mass @xmath429 ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; bullock 2001 ; bett 2007 ) .",
    "there are several reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , the number density of haloes of a given mass depends noticeably on the environment density @xmath387  : haloes are preferentially found in mildly overdense regions . here , however , the distribution of evolved density @xmath387 associated to the random realisations of fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] is not representative of a fair halo sample  : it peaks around @xmath404 , where the average spin at collapse is much lower than in high density regions @xmath430 .",
    "second , the angular momentum of a collapsing region satisfies the equation @xmath431 where @xmath432 is the torque and @xmath433 is the inertia tensor .",
    "we note that the angular momentum vanishes to first order if the inertia tensor is zero at initial time , or if @xmath434 and @xmath435 are perfectly aligned ( white 1984 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ) . in this limit",
    ", the growth of angular momentum is of second order only , @xmath436 , and is dominated by nonlinear effects after turnaround ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case here as we are considering perturbations that are initially spherical .",
    "a more realistic treatment should include first - order tidal torquing .",
    "third , our axis collapse condition strongly reduces the amount of angular momentum gained by the halo after the second axis collapses . a different prescription , such as the one adopted by eisenstein & loeb ( 1995 ) , would increase the magnitude of the spin parameter at third axis collapse .",
    "finally , analytic calculations indicate that a significant fraction of the angular momentum is acquired through the collapse of the outermost shells ( ryden 1988 ; quinn & binney 1992 ) .",
    "this can only be taken into account by a detailed modelling of the matter density and velocity profiles around the collapsing haloes .    in spite of these limitations ,",
    "it is worthwhile looking at the alignment between halo spin and environment as this quantity does not depend on the magnitude of the angular momentum gained during the collapse . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] , the histogram shows the alignment distribution at collapse time .",
    "the angle is measured between the angular momentum of the collapsing region and the symmetry axis / plane of the mass distribution .",
    "clearly , haloes show a strong tendency to have their spin aligned perpendicularly to the filament or parallel to the mass sheet .",
    "this is in good agreement with the findings of hahn ( 2007 ) and aragn - calvo ( 2007a ) , although the former authors found a clear correlation for haloes residing in sheet - like structures only and the latter a mass - dependent spin orientation in filaments ( see also sousbie 2007 ; trujillo , carretero & patiri 2006 ) .",
    "more precisely , the alignment is strongest along the second principal axis of the shear tensor .",
    "this owes to the fact that , once the first axis has collapsed , @xmath437 .",
    "the growth rate is largest for the intermediate axis , @xmath438 , since the difference @xmath439  s are the ( ordered ) eigenvalues of the large scale potential @xmath440 dominates the other two ( see also lee & pen 2000 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether the initial alignment between inertia and deformation tensors reported by lee & pen ( 2000 ) and porciani , dekel & hoffman ( 2002b ) can produce a similar correlation .",
    "we have not investigated this issue any further .",
    "to summarise , we have demonstrated that our simplified model , which takes into account both the dynamical and statistical aspects of the ellipsoidal collapse , produces a clear correlation between formation redshift , large scale bias and environment density .",
    "the strength of the effect is of the same magnitude as seen in simulations .",
    "it is largest for low mass haloes , @xmath0 , and fades as we go to high masses , @xmath1 .",
    "haloes that formed at high redshift are substantially more clustered than those that assembled recently .",
    "this is precisely the behaviour reported by gao , springel & white ( 2005 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this model predicts a negative correlation between formation redshift and environment density , in contradiction with the trend measured by harker ( 2006 ) .",
    "however , simulations indicate that halo properties depend on environment in a complex way  : in relatively underdense regions , the average formation redshift increases with decreasing environment density ( harker 2006 ) while haloes are more strongly clustered than the mean ( abbas & sheth 2007 ) .",
    "our model produces an effect in the right sense .",
    "this suggests that the ellipsoidal collapse may apply in underdense regions where nonlinear effects are weak or absent .",
    "in this section , we discuss the sensitivity of the environmental effects considered above to the shape of the collapse barrier , as well as non - markovianity and tidal interactions as potential sources of environmental dependence .      the strength of the environmental effect explored in  [ sub : results ] may somewhat depend on the parametrisation adopted for the moving barrier . while this is probably true for haloes of mass @xmath378 , the detailed shape of the barrier should have a little impact when @xmath398 . in this mass range ,",
    "the average collapse density @xmath380 , a taylor series without loss of generality , should be dominated by the term of largest degree .",
    "for the simple case considered here , @xmath441 when @xmath442 .",
    "the exponent @xmath341 has a great influence on the correlation between formation redshift and environment density .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cslope ] , where contours of constant @xmath443 are plotted for a halo mass @xmath409 . shown for illustration are the median formation redshifts of two extreme cases @xmath383 and @xmath444 ( filled symbol ) when @xmath340 and @xmath341 assume the functional form  ( [ eq : fform ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath340 has a substantial impact on the formation redshift only when @xmath341 is far from a critical ( empirically determined ) value @xmath445 . along this curve ,",
    "the effect of varying @xmath340 vanishes , presumably because the effective spectral index @xmath446 that controls the shape of @xmath447 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : czform ] ) conspires to maintain the median formation redshift constant .",
    "since @xmath446 varies with the mass scale , we expect @xmath448 to change somewhat with the halo mass .",
    "the fact that the ellipsoidal dynamics predicts a value @xmath354 close to @xmath448 is a coincidence .",
    "regarding the environmental dependence of halo bias , note that , in the limits @xmath442 and @xmath449 , the bias offset is @xmath450 to first order in @xmath451 and @xmath452 . in this regime , changing the value of @xmath341 has a large effect on the bias of haloes lying at the extreme ends of the mass range .",
    "however , unlike the environmental dependence of formation redshift , it is the parameter @xmath340 that influences most the bias when the halo mass is in the range @xmath453 .",
    "we also note that the fitting formula  ( [ eq : bias ] ) of sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) holds for @xmath341 strictly less than one only",
    ". it would be prudent to check again their approximation , namely , derive the first crossing distribution from a large ensemble of random trajectories when the values of @xmath340 , @xmath341 differ significantly from those at mean density ( @xmath351 ) .",
    "we have shown that each of the shape parameters @xmath340 and @xmath341 has a distinct impact on the halo formation redshift and large scale bias .",
    "therefore , an environmental dependence of formation redshift and bias will be present regardless the exact values of these variables .      in the excursion set formalism , a spherical symmetric window function @xmath454",
    "is used to define the trajectories of the linear density field @xmath455 as a function of smoothing scale .",
    "when the sharp @xmath3-space filter is adopted , @xmath455 executes a random walk .",
    "the property of markovianity has been exploited extensively to obtain analytic expressions for the first crossing distribution etc .",
    "this is the reason why we have considered that particular window function in the computation of halo formation redshift and bias . however , the markov nature of brownian walks prevents any correlation between large scale environment and assembly history ( see white 1996 for a discussion ) .",
    "halo merger trees are indeed non - markovian across short time steps ( neistein & dekel 2007 ) .",
    "a natural way to introduce correlations would be to use another window function .",
    "this possibility has been considered by several authors ( e.g. peacock & heavens 1990 ; bond 1991 ; white 1996 ; schcker 2001 ; nagashima 2001 ; amosov & schcker 2004 ; zentner 2007 ) . here",

    "the density contrast is set to @xmath487 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath488 ( solid curves ) . to ensure that the trajectories @xmath455 describe the formation history of @xmath489 haloes , we should also have constrained the density so that @xmath455 does not cross the barrier @xmath490 on scale larger than @xmath76 .",
    "here we ignore this constraint since its implementation is not straightforward when the window function differs from a sharp @xmath3-space filter .",
    "this is the reason why a substantial fraction of the trajectories penetrate the barrier @xmath490 on scale @xmath481 .",
    "this caveat notwithstanding , the present calculation is adequate to understand , at least qualitatively , the effect of non - markovianity . notice that the difference @xmath491 is approximately constant throughout most of the halo formation history ( @xmath492 ) .",
    "most importantly , the effect is about twice as large for the high mass halo while , at fixed @xmath493 , the scatter of the residual field is lower by @xmath494 per cent .",
    "this suggests that the environmental dependence which arises from non - markovianess is stronger for high mass haloes .",
    "this has also been pointed out by zentner ( 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely to explain the trend seen in overdense regions where , undoubtedly , correlations are stronger for low mass haloes ( e.g. gao & white 2007 ) .",
    "however , it may apply for isolated haloes in voids or underdense regions .",
    "it should also leave a signature distinct from the ellipsoidal collapse which , as we have seen , induces a stronger dependence for low mass haloes .",
    "irregularities in the mass distribution induce non - radial motions that slow down the collapse ( peebles & growth 1976 ; davis & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1990 ) .",
    "this `` previrialisation '' conjecture is supported by the numerical investigations of , e.g. , barrow & silk ( 1981 ) ; szalay & silk ( 1983 ) ; villumsen & davis ( 1986 ) ; lokas ( 1996 ) ; and by the analytic calculations of del popolo ( 1998 ; 2001 ) , which indicate that tidal heating can counterbalance the effect of the shear and delay the collapse .",
    "recently , avila - reese ( 2005 ) , maulbetsch ( 2006 ) , wang ( 2006 ) and diemand ( 2007 ) have proposed that the assembly bias seen in n - body simulations originates from tidal interactions with a larger neighbour .",
    "they have shown that , at late time , the tidal field of massive neighbouring clumps halts the growth of haloes and , in many cases , even reduces their mass .",
    "furthermore , tidal effects appears to have a larger influence on small mass haloes .",
    "therefore , this could also explain why the age - dependence of clustering is stronger for low mass haloes .",
    "the large effect measured by diemand ( 2007 ) indicates that , in high density regions , tidal interactions are likely to overwhelm the environmental dependence arising from anisotropic collapse , and increase the average formation redshift in overdense regions .",
    "although the impact of tidal stripping can only be rigorously quantified with numerical simulations , the suppression of mass accretion through tidal heating could also be addressed analytically .",
    "the spherical collapse model , in which the collapsing object is divided into a series of concentric shells , seems better suited than the ellipsoidal collapse .",
    "a thorough discussion of tidal heating is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "note , however , that the torque imparted by the ( external ) mass distribution on a thin spherical shell is @xmath495 ( e.g. ryden & gunn 1987 ) , where @xmath496 is the deviation from the spherically symmetric distribution @xmath497 .",
    "this is @xmath498 which pulls the infalling matter out of its purely radial motion . in the linear regime",
    ", @xmath498 is a gaussian density field statistically independent of the spherical average @xmath497 .",
    "hence , tidal heating does not induce any environmental dependence at first order .",
    "consequently , modelling the growth of nonlinearities in the surrounding mass distribution will be crucial to ascertain analytically the importance of tidal heating in the environmental dependence of halo collapse .",
    "the ellipsoidal collapse model is an extension of the spherical dynamics that takes into account the anisotropic collapse of triaxial perturbations .",
    "this non - spherical dynamics provides a substantially better description of halo statistics such as mass function and large scale bias .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether the ellipsoidal collapse can induce environmental effects similar to that seen in n - body simulations .    in this paper , we have attempted to address this issue , paying special attention to both the statistical and dynamical origin of the environmental dependence . in a first part , we have explored the statistical correlation that arises in ( gaussian ) initial conditions between the local properties of the shear and the configuration of the large scale environment . to this purpose ,",
    "a number of joint statistics for the shear tensor have been derived , thereby extending the previous analysis of doroshkevich ( 1970 ) . in a second part",
    ", we have examined the dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model that takes into account the interaction between a collapsing , ellipsoidal perturbation and its large scale environment .",
    "relaxing the assumption of sphericity ( at the heart of the spherical collapse ) introduces a dependence of collapse redshift on environment . the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass distribution alters the collapse of the major and minor axes , and causes haloes embedded in large overdensities to virialize earliest .",
    "we have found that the environment density is a key parameter in determining the virialization redshift , the large scale asphericity contributing mostly to increase the scatter in collapse density .",
    "an effective barrier whose shape depends on the large scale density provides a good description of this environmental effect .",
    "such an interpretation has the advantage that the eps formalism can be applied to estimate the environmental dependence of halo properties like formation redshift and large scale bias .",
    "we have shown that , using this moving barrier approach , a correlation between formation redshift , large scale bias and environment density naturally arises .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is similar , albeit smaller , to that seen in n - body simulations .",
    "it is large for low mass haloes @xmath0 , and fades as we go to high masses @xmath1 as a result of a genuine statistical effect , namely , the decrease in average asymmetry and stochasticity with increasing halo mass .",
    "haloes that formed at high redshift are found to be more clustered than those that assembled recently .",
    "this is precisely the behaviour reported by sheth & tormen ( 2004 ) ; gao , springel & white ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , haloes in denser regions are predicted to assemble later .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the trend measured in overdense environments @xmath499 .",
    "it calls into question the role of the ellipsoidal collapse in shaping the halo mass function .",
    "nevertheless , several lines of recent evidence indicate that , in relatively underdense regions , the average formation redshift increases with decreasing environment density ( e.g. harker 2006 ) , while haloes may be more strongly clustered than the mean ( abbas & sheth 2007 ) .",
    "our model predicts and effect in the right sense .",
    "this suggests that the ellipsoidal collapse model may be applicable in underdense regions , where tidal interactions are weak or absent .",
    "conditional halo mass functions @xmath500 could provide another testable prediction since , in the moving barrier interpretation adopted here , it is expected that @xmath500 in underdense regions should be ( slightly ) biased towards high mass haloes as compared to the prediction of sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) .",
    "recently , sandvik ( 2007 ) have discussed a multi - dimensional extension of the eps formalism that takes into account ellipsoidal collapse ( chiueh & lee 2001 ) .",
    "they find a very weak correlation between halo assembly history and environment , presumably because their implementation includes only the statistical aspect of environmental effects . in our scenario ,",
    "the dynamical interaction between the external mass distribution and the collapsing halo plays a crucial role in the environmental dependence of halo properties .",
    "the statistical correlations contribute mostly to increase the strength of the effect with decreasing halo mass .",
    "keselman & nusser ( 2007 ) have shown that the age - dependence of halo bias persists in a simplified description of gravitational dynamics , suggesting thereby that ( at least some of ) the environmental dependence arises in the early stages of the collapse .",
    "they find that halo formation redshift strongly correlates with the dimensionless parameter @xmath501 , young haloes forming from fluctuations with higher @xmath502 than old ones .",
    "they argue that this follows from the dependence of _ first axis _",
    "collapse on configuration shape , namely , a planar perturbation collapses faster than a spherical perturbation with the same initial density ( bertschinger & jain 1994 ) .",
    "their results are , however , difficult to reconcile with the above interpretation since it implies that , for a fixed halo mass , haloes forming in regions of larger @xmath502 are older ( because they grow less rapidly ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be alleviated if one assumes that the formation of virialized haloes corresponds to the collapse of the _ third axis_. in this case , the collapse is always faster for spherical perturbations ( audit , teyssier & alimi 1997 ) so that young haloes tend to form in regions of higher @xmath502 , i.e. more spherical or denser environments , in agreement with our findings .",
    "a serious shortcoming of our model is the neglect of anisotropies beyond the quadrupole term in the external density field .",
    "furthermore , apart from a global rotation , it ignores the non - radial degrees of freedom in the collapsing protohalo .",
    "it would be of great interest to ascertain whether non - radial motions created by a clumpy , growing large scale mass distribution can induce an effect similar to that seen in simulations . _ a priori _",
    ", tidal heating should be more efficient in high density environments .",
    "it may plausibly reverse the trend found in this paper , namely , increase the critical collapse density in large scale overdensities .",
    "if this happens to be true , a moving barrier approach would naturally predict haloes in dense regions to assemble relatively early and to be more strongly clustered than the mean . alternatively , wang ( 2007 ) have suggested that tidal heating causes haloes to appear less massive than expected from their initial density field .",
    "this may also provide an explanation for the relatively large / low bias of old / young haloes . clearly , large n - body simulations are needed to understand the complex relations reported by , e.g. harker ( 2006 ) , wechsler ( 2006 ) , gao & white ( 2007 ) .",
    "this caveat notwithstanding , analytic models can provide an elegant route to capturing the essential features of the environmental dependence .    in standard galaxy formation models , the correlation between the haloes and their large scale environment introduces a correlation between the properties of galaxies and the regions they occupy ( e.g. navarro , abadi & steinmetz 2004 ; abbas & sheth 2005 , 2006 ; berlind 2005 ) .",
    "the observational results of skibba ( 2006 ) , blanton ( 2006 ) and tinker ( 2007 ) support this prediction and leave little room for a galaxy assembly bias ( see , however , croton 2007 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the influence of the environmental dependence of halo properties on the galaxy population remains unclear .",
    "it would be valuable to assess whether environmental effects produced by the anisotropic collapse of haloes can leave a detectable signature in the properties of field galaxies .",

    "unfortunately , these methods can not be easily applied when g is the orthogonal group so(n ) , essentially because the representations of so(n ) and gl(n , r ) are very different .",
