    "collisions of elementary particles , hadrons , and nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies produce a multitude of particles ( `` multiparticle production '' ) .",

    "hadron - hadron collisions only few particles are produced , and it is unlikely that many final - state interactions occur .",
    "the particles decouple ( `` freeze out '' ) from the system soon after production .    on the other hand , in @xmath1 collisions",
    "the density of produced particles is sufficiently large over an extended region in space - time , such that the mean free path of produced particles becomes small and many final - state interactions occur .",
    "these interactions drive the system towards local _ thermodynamic _ , _ i.e. _ , _ thermal _ , _ mechanical _ , and _ chemical _ equilibrium . in local thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by the equations of ideal fluid dynamics @xcite . if the system is only thermally and mechanically , _",
    "i.e. _ , _ kinetically _ , but not chemically equilibrated , these equations have to be supplemented by rate equations which determine the chemical composition of the system @xcite . in both cases , pressure gradients between dense , equilibrated matter and the vacuum drive collective expansion , which cools and dilutes the system .",
    "freeze - out of particles occurs when microscopic interaction rates become smaller than the macroscopic expansion rate of the system .    by definition , after freeze - out the momenta of the produced particles do not change .",
    "the experimentally measured spectra of hadronic particles thus reflect the state of the system _ at _ freeze - out .",
    "the question is whether the spectra can also tell us about the state of the system _ prior _ to freeze - out ?",
    "for instance , can they tell us whether the system was in thermodynamic , or at least kinetic equilibrium ?",
    "do they provide information as to whether a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , _ i.e. _ , an equilibrated state of quarks and gluons , was created at some stage during the evolution of the system ?",
    "these questions are addressed in the following . in section [ ii ] , i discuss whether the exponential nature of single - inclusive , invariant particle spectra is sufficient to conclude that the system was in thermal equilibrium . in section [ iii ] , it is argued that in @xmath1 collisions collective expansion is likely to occur prior to kinetic freeze - out . in section [ iv ] , i discuss how final - state particle ratios yield information about the thermodynamic conditions at chemical freeze - out .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ v ] .",
    "in multiparticle production processes , single - inclusive , invariant particle spectra are typically exponential in the transverse momentum , @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for the exponential behavior is the phase space of the final multiparticle state @xcite .",
    "consider for instance a process where two particles ( or nuclei ) collide and produce @xmath3 particles in the final state .",
    "label the 4-momenta of the two incoming particles as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the 4-momenta of the @xmath3 outgoing particles as @xmath6 .",

    "the single - inclusive , invariant cross section for the production of a certain particle species  without loss of generality assumed to have 4-momentum @xmath13  is then ( again , up to constants ) @xmath14^{-1}\\ ;   \\int \\prod_{i=2}^n \\",

    "the momentum - space volume has dimension mev@xmath19 .",

    "the first factor , the momentum - space volume , is in some sense trivial .    to compute the momentum - space volume , for the sake of simplicity ( and because it allows us to obtain a purely analytic result )",
    "let us assume that all @xmath3 particles in the final state are massless . in this case ,",

    "no assumption about thermal equilibration is necessary to obtain this result .",
    "nevertheless , single - inclusive particle spectra are also exponential in thermal equilibrium , _ i.e. _ , for a system at temperature @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", the invariant transverse momentum spectrum is given by the cooper - frye formula @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the 3-dimensional space - time hypersurface on which the transverse momentum spectrum is computed , @xmath37 is the normal vector on @xmath36 , and @xmath38 is the thermal distribution function . for boltzmann particles , @xmath39 ; @xmath40 is the fugacity of the particle , and @xmath41 the chemical potential .",

    "( [ cooperfryeformula ] ) is the 4-velocity of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the _ average _ 4-velocity of _ particle flow_. in the rest frame of the system , @xmath43 .    for the sake of simplicity , compute the spectrum at constant time , where @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 for ultrarelativistic particles , the energy per particle is related to the temperature via @xmath46 , such that at midrapidity @xmath47 this is rather similar to eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) , except that the ( inverse ) slope of the @xmath2-spectrum is equal to the true thermodynamic temperature @xmath48 , while previously , @xmath49 is a factor 3/2 larger .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is that invariant momentum space is not identical to thermodynamic momentum space . for a single particle ,",
    "the former is @xmath50 , while the latter is @xmath51 .",
    "the missing factor of @xmath52 is responsible for the difference in the exponential slope .    from an experimental point of view , without a fully exclusive measurement one can not precisely tell the number of particles in the final state , such that the energy per particle @xmath53 is unknown .",
    "the important point is that then _ there is no possibility to distinguish between the two cases _ eqs .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) and ( [ result2 ] ) : usually , the strategy is to perform an exponential fit to transverse momentum spectra with a slope parameter @xmath54 , but in this way one can not test whether the relationship between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the same as in thermal equilibrium . although the spectra are exponential , like for a thermal system , the system need not be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "although the slope parameter is a quantity with the same dimension as temperature , temperature is not defined , if the system is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "one may even go one step further : although single - inclusive spectra for _ different _ particle species may have the same slope parameter , this does not mean that the system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is simply due to the fact that the slope is proportional to the energy per particle @xmath53 , which is a constant for all @xmath3 particles in the final state of a @xmath12 process at a given c.m .",
    "energy @xmath55 .",
    "slope parameters for the most abundant particle species show different behavior as a function of particle mass in @xmath1 as compared to @xmath56 collisions @xcite . in @xmath1 collisions",
    ", they increase linearly with the particle mass , @xmath57 while in @xmath56 collisions , they are independent of the particle mass , @xmath58 for cern - sps energies , @xmath59 mev for both @xmath1 and @xmath56 collisions , while @xmath60 depends on the system size ; it increases with the mass number @xmath61 of the nuclei .",
    "although there might be other explanations for this behavior , the most natural interpretation is in terms of collective motion .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 is the slope parameter determined by multiparticle momentum space .",
    "since the energy per particle @xmath53 is an intensive quantity , in both cases @xmath63 is independent of the system size .",
    "once the particles are created , however , the environment matters , _ i.e. _ , whether there are many final - state interactions , like in @xmath1 collisions , or whether the particles more or less freely stream towards the detector , like in @xmath0 and @xmath56 collisions .",
    "as explained in the introduction , in the first case local kinetic equilibration of the system leads to pressure gradients , which in turn generate collective motion .",
    "the constant @xmath60 parametrizes this collective motion ; it is proportional to the ( average ) collective flow velocity of the expanding system @xcite .",
    "the larger the system , the more final - state interactions occur , and the larger is the collective flow velocity .",
    "consequently , @xmath60 increases with the system size .",
    "a word of caution is in order .",
    "the fact that there is collective motion in @xmath1 collisions does not necessarily mean that local kinetic equilibrium is established and , consequently , ideal fluid dynamics applies to determine the evolution of the system .",
    "pressure gradients which drive collective motion occur also in systems away from equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that there is collective motion indicates that there are final - state interactions , which will _ eventually _ drive the system towards kinetic equilibrium , unless the macroscopic expansion rate considerably exceeds the microscopic scattering rate .",
    "therefore , the ideal - fluid approximation for the dynamical evolution of the system might not be too bad , especially for collisions of large nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "freeze - out of particles occurs when microscopic interaction rates become small as compared to the macroscopic collective expansion rate . in fluid dynamical models ,",
    "one commonly assumes kinetic freeze - out to happen instantaneously along space - time hypersurfaces of constant density or temperature .",
    "this is certainly an idealization : microscopically , a particle has a certain probability to decouple anywhere and anytime during the evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "the invariant momentum spectra of frozen - out particles are computed according to eq .",
    "( [ cooperfryeformula ] ) , with the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath64 .",
    "there are a number of conceptual problems with this formula , a discussion of which is beyond the scope of this talk , see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details . in practice , however , the cooper - frye formula ( [ cooperfryeformula ] ) is sufficient to compute the particle spectra to reasonable accuracy .",
    "let us assume that kinetic freeze - out happens across a surface of constant temperature @xmath65 . applying the mean - value theorem to eq .",
    "( [ cooperfryeformula ] ) , the spectrum of frozen - out particles at midrapidity @xmath66 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are suitably defined _ average _ values for the transverse fluid 3-velocity and the lorentz gamma factor along the freeze - out hypersurface . at @xmath66 ,",
    "it is reasonable to neglect longitudinal collective motion , such that @xmath70 is determined by @xmath71 .",
    "assuming azimuthal symmetry , the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) then depends only on two parameters , the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath65 and the modulus of the average transverse collective flow velocity @xmath72 .",
    ".kinetic freeze - out temperatures and average transverse flow velocities for @xmath73 collisions at @xmath74gev . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    table [ table1 ] shows values for @xmath65 and @xmath72 extracted by several authors from experimental spectra for @xmath73 collisions at cern - sps energies , @xmath74gev . from eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) it is obvious that @xmath65 and @xmath72 are correlated : fits of similar quality can be obtained by trading off a lower value for @xmath65 against a higher value for @xmath72 and vice versa .",
    "this can also be seen in the values quoted in table [ table1 ] .",
    "this ambiguity can be removed by two - particle correlations , where @xmath65 and @xmath72 are correlated in the opposite way @xcite .",
    "in principle , there is another , independent way to determine thermodynamic quantities at freeze - out .",
    "first note that , in order to compute the transverse momentum spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) of particle species @xmath75 , one not only needs to know the temperature and the transverse flow velocity along the freeze - out hypersurface , which determine the shape of the spectrum as a function of @xmath2 , but also the fugacity @xmath76 , which determines the absolute normalization of the spectrum , cf .",
    "( [ cooperfryeformula ] ) . in general",
    ", @xmath77 varies along the freeze - out hypersurface , but in order to proceed , let us make the assumption ( the first of three ) that it is constant , like the temperature @xmath65 . in the following , we shall drop the subscript `` f.o . '' , but remember that all thermodynamic quantities , as well as the flow 4-velocity @xmath42 , are taken on the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "the second assumption we shall make is that _ all _ particle species freeze out across the _ same _ freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "this is certainly an idealization , as the mean free paths of different particle species are different @xcite . under these two assumptions ,",
    "the ratio of the _ total _ particle numbers of particle species @xmath75 and @xmath78 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the 4-current of particle species @xmath75 . in kinetic equilibrium",
    "the 4-current assumes the simple form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the density of particles of species @xmath75 in the local rest frame .",
    "the flow 4-velocity @xmath42 is common to all particle species because the system is assumed to be kinetically equilibrated immediately prior to freeze - out .",
    "equation ( [ ratio ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath83 because the factor @xmath84 cancels between numerator and denominator .",
    "the result ( [ ratio2 ] ) is remarkable in the sense that , under the present assumptions , the ratio of total particle yields is _ independent _ of the detailed dynamical evolution of the system _ prior _ to freeze - out .",
    "moreover , this ratio is the same as for a system in _ global _ kinetic equilibrium at temperature @xmath34 with chemical potentials @xmath85 .",
    "let us now make the third assumption , namely that the system is not only in kinetic , _",
    "i.e. _ , thermal and mechanical equilibrium , but also in _ chemical _ equilibrium",
    ". this assumption is fulfilled if inelastic ( and not only elastic ) collision rates are sufficiently large . in this case , the chemical potential of particle species @xmath75 is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are baryon , strangeness , and electric charge chemical potentials , respectively , and @xmath89 are baryon , strangeness , and electric charges of particle species @xmath75 .",
    "the ellipsis in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) stands for possible other conserved charges with associated chemical potentials .",
    "global baryon , strangeness , and charge conservation impose additional conditions which allow to eliminate all charge chemical potentials except for one , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath90 .",
    "then , all particle ratios are a function of two parameters only , @xmath34 and @xmath90 . taking into account the known ( vacuum ) values for the hadronic masses @xmath91 and the ( vacuum ) partial decay widths @xmath92 , one",
    "can then extract @xmath34 and @xmath90 from ( @xmath93 extrapolated ) data via a @xmath94 analysis .",
    "different authors use slightly different strategies to perform such @xmath94 fits . some introduce a hard - core repulsion between hadrons @xcite , some relax the assumption of chemical equilibration of strangeness @xcite , some conserve strangeness exactly in the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "in essence , all methods introduce at least one additional parameter , which of course improves the quality of the fit , but does not fundamentally change the underlying assumptions .",
    "all fits are roughly of the same quality , which makes it hard to draw definite conclusions regarding the necessity of the individual approach .    results of @xmath94 analyses for @xmath0 , @xmath56 , as well as @xmath1 collisions with equal - mass nuclei at various collision energies are compiled in fig .",
    "[ figtmu ] ( see also @xcite for a similar compilation ) .",
    "two features are remarkable : first , as noted by cleymans and redlich @xcite , all @xmath95 combinations fall on a line of constant energy per particle , @xmath96 gev . the value 1 gev can be intuitively understood as setting the energy scale below which inelastic collisions cease and",
    "therefore chemical equilibration becomes impossible .",
    "the second feature is that , at cern - sps energies and above , the freeze - out temperature is @xmath97 mev , which is somewhat higher than the kinetic freeze - out temperature discussed in the last section .",
    "this can be understood rather naturally noting that the extraction of a freeze - out temperature from particle ratios assumed chemical equilibrium , while the extraction from single - inclusive spectra only assumed kinetic equilibrium .",
    "thus , particle ratios determine the temperature at _ chemical _ freeze - out , and not at kinetic freeze - out .",
    "since chemical equilibrium requires frequent _ inelastic _ collisions , while kinetic equilibrium only requires frequent _ elastic _ collisions , chemical freeze - out occurs earlier , _",
    "i.e. _ , at larger temperatures , than kinetic freeze - out .",
    "in order to distinguish quantities at chemical from those at kinetic freeze - out , in the following the former will be denoted with a subscript `` ch . '' , and the latter with the subscript `` f.o . '' , as above .",
    "given a set of hadronic masses @xmath91 and decay widths @xmath92 , the extracted values of @xmath98 displayed in fig .",
    "[ figtmu ] are relatively insensitive to errors in the experimental determination of total particle numbers .",
    "this can be seen in the non - relativistic approximation , @xmath99 such that eq .",
    "( [ ratio2 ] ) becomes @xmath100 errors in the determination of @xmath101 and @xmath102 influence the fitted values for @xmath103 and @xmath104 only logarithmically .    on the other hand , as can be also seen from eq .",
    "( [ ratio3 ] ) , the values for the hadronic masses @xmath91 entering the fit influence @xmath103 and @xmath104 _ linearly_. most fits assume that the hadronic masses and decay widths at chemical freeze - out are the same as in vacuum . at such large temperatures and chemical potentials , however , a change of mass and decay width due to in - medium interactions can not be excluded @xcite , @xmath105 .",
    "these interactions are elastic collisions which still occur at chemical freeze - out , since the system remains _ kinetically _ equilibrated . in @xcite , such an analysis was performed for @xmath73 collisions at cern - sps energies in the framework of a chiral model . in this model , masses in general decrease at large density and temperature ,",
    "such that the value for the chemical freeze - out temperature is smaller than for a fit with vacuum masses , @xmath106 mev .",
    "interestingly , in the calculation of @xcite it turns out to be approximately the same as the _ kinetic _ freeze - out temperature , although at kinetic freeze - out , particles _ have _ to attain their vacuum masses , due to the absence of any kind of interaction .",
    "clearly , more work has to be done to understand and possibly refine the freeze - out picture , for instance , also to include in - medium modifications of the decay widths .",
    "in this talk , i first discussed single - inclusive , invariant particle spectra in a @xmath12 process .",
    "i explicitly demonstrated that the momentum space volume of the final - state particles gives rise to the exponential nature of these spectra .",
    "for the special case of massless particles , i showed that the slope of the spectra differs from the one for a thermally equilibrated system of particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , that exponential particle spectra alone are _ not _ indicative for the existence of thermal equilibrium .",
    "i then argued that the slope characteristics for different particle species suggest collective motion in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "single - inclusive , invariant particle spectra then yield information about the _",
    "average _ temperature @xmath65 and _ average _ collective flow velocity @xmath72 at kinetic freeze - out .    finally , i discussed the extraction of the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 from particle ratios .",
    "this analysis is based upon rather restrictive assumptions , and depends sensitively on the hadronic masses and decay widths .",
    "nevertheless , it is astonishing that a fit with essentially two parameters can reproduce a multitude of data with reasonably good quality .",
    "there could be several explanations .",
    "first , the state preceding chemical freeze - out is indeed in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the degrees of freedom could be hadrons , but since @xmath103 is close to the temperature of the confinement - deconfinement transition , it is , however , also conceivable that at some earlier stage in the evolution of the system a thermodynamically equilibrated qgp has existed @xcite . from thermodynamic arguments alone , however , one can never distinguish between these two possibilities : by definition , a state in thermodynamic equilibrium has no knowledge about its past .",
    "the discussion of section [ ii ] allows for a second explanation .",
    "multiparticle production saturates the available phase space , such that final - state hadrons have exponential spectra with a slope that can be interpreted as a temperature , and an absolute normalization that can be interpreted as a fugacity .",
    "although the discussion of section [ ii ] has shown that the final state need not be thermodynamically equilibrated to have these properties , it then at least looks like hadrons are `` born into thermodynamic equilibrium '' @xcite . in principle , the chemical composition could then immediately freeze out . in this case , no additional assumptions about an equilibrated state _ preceding _ chemical freeze - out are necessary . as seen in section [ iii",
    "] , there certainly are elastic interactions which cause collective motion , but this could in principle happen after chemical freeze - out .",
    "to distinguish between the first and second scenario , a more thorough understanding of multiparticle production in @xmath1 collisions is necessary . the only way to achieve this is to compare @xmath1 with @xmath56 and @xmath107 collisions .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to gather more experimental data on the latter at comparable collision energies .",
