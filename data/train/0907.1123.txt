    "the field of metamaterials @xcite is driven by fascinating and far - reaching theoretical visions such as , e.g. , perfect lenses @xcite , invisibility cloaking @xcite , and enhanced optical nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "this emerging field has seen spectacular experimental progress in recent years @xcite . yet , losses are orders of magnitude too large for the envisioned applications . achieving such reduction by further design optimization appears to be out of reach .",
    "thus , incorporation of active media ( gain ) might reduce the losses .",
    "the procedure would be to simply inject an electrical current into the active medium , leading to gain and hence to compensation of the losses .",
    "however , experiments on such intricate active nanostructures do need guidance by theory via self - consistent calculations ( using the semi - classical theory of lasing ) for realistic gain materials that can be incorporated into or close to dispersive media to reduce the losses at thz or optical frequencies .",
    "the need for _ self - consistent _ calculations stems from the fact that increasing the gain in the metamaterial , the metamaterial properties change , in turn changes the coupling to the gain medium until a steady - state is reached .",
    "a specific geometry to overcome the severe loss problem of optical metamaterials and to enable bulk metamaterials with negative magnetic and electric response and controllable dispersion at optical frequencies is to interleave active , optically pumped gain material layers with the passive metamaterial lattice .    for reference , the best fabricated negative - index material operating at around @xmath0 wavelength @xcite has shown a figure of merit , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the effective refractive index .",
    "this experimental result is equivalent to an absolute absorption coefficient of @xmath3 , which is even larger than the absorption of typical direct - gap semiconductors such as , e.g. , gaas ( where @xmath4 ) .",
    "so it looks difficult to compensate the losses with this simple type of analysis , which assumes that the bulk gain coefficient is needed .",
    "however , the effective gain coefficient , derived from self - consistent microscopic calculations , is a more appropriate measure of the combined system of metamaterial and gain . due to pronounced local - field enhancement effects in the spatial vicinity of the dispersive metamaterial",
    ", the effective gain coefficient can be substantially larger than its bulk counterpart .",
    "while early models @xcite using simplified gain - mechanisms such as explicitly forcing negative imaginary parts of the local gain material s response function produce unrealistic strictly linear gain , our self - consistent approach presented below allows for determining the range of parameters for which one can realistically expect linear amplification and linear loss compensation in the metamaterial @xcite . to fully understand the coupled metamaterial - gain system , we have to deal with time - dependent wave equations in metamaterial systems by coupling maxwell s equations with the rate equations of electron populations describing a multi - level gain system in semi - classical theory @xcite .",
    "this paper aims to apply a detailed computational model to the problem of metamaterials with gain .",
    "in , we present the semi - classical theory of lasing and describe in detail the computational approach . in , we verify that our code agrees well with simple soluble models ( gain material only ) .",
    "in addition , our code is applied to 1d superlattice of gain and negative index layers .",
    "next , a 2d problem is considered , which is a square lattice of lorentz dielectric cylinders with layers of gain material .",
    "finally , a 2d split ring resonator ( srr ) with gain material inclusions is considered .",
    "gain can compensate the losses and lasing ( spasing ) is achieved in our numerical simulations . in , we present our conclusions .",
    "the gain atoms are embedded in host medium and described by a generic four - level system , as shown in .",
    "all quantities including the fields and occupation numbers are tracked at each point in space and take into account energy exchange between gain atoms and fields , external pumping and non - radiative decays @xcite .",
    "electrons are pumped by an external mechanism from the ground state level ( @xmath5 ) to the third level ( @xmath6 ) . after a short lifetime @xmath7",
    ", they quickly relax into the metastable second level ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the second level ( @xmath8 ) and the first level ( @xmath9 ) are called as the upper and lower lasing levels , respectively .",
    "electrons can transfer both radiatively ( spontaneous and stimulated emissions ) and non - radiatively from the upper to the lower lasing level . at last",
    ", they transfer quickly and non - radiatively from the first level ( @xmath9 ) to the ground state level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the energies of ground state and the third level are @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in optical pumping mechanism , electrons are raised from the ground state level ( @xmath5 ) to the third level ( @xmath6 ) by an external electromagnetic wave with the pumping frequency @xmath12 , which is chosen to be @xmath13 in our simulations .",
    "the local intensity of the pumping em wave varies with the position and determines the pumping rate at each point .",
    "the lifetimes and energies of the upper and lower lasing levels are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "the time - dependent maxwell equations are given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the electric polarization density of the gain material .",
    "( @xmath26 is the induced electric polarization density on the atomic transition between the upper ( @xmath8 ) and lower ( @xmath9 ) lasing levels , and @xmath27 is between the ground state level ( @xmath5 ) and the third level ( @xmath6 ) . )",
    "the induced electric polarizations behave as harmonic oscillators and couple to the local @xmath28 field , which is propagated by maxwell equations .",
    "the polarization density @xmath29 obeys locally the following equation of motion @xcite    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the linewidth of the atomic transition @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the coupling strength of @xmath34 to the electric field , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the population inversions that drive the polarizations . in our simulations",
    ", @xmath37 is chosen to be equal to @xmath38 or @xmath39 and @xmath40 is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "the values for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are taken to be @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . from , it can be easily derived @xcite that the atomic response of gain atoms has a lorentzian lineshape and is homogeneously broadened .",
    "the occupation numbers at each spatial point vary according to the following rate equations , @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the induced radiation rate or excitation rate depending on its sign . instead of using an external em wave to optically pump electrons from the ground state level ( @xmath5 ) to the third level ( @xmath6 ) , we can simplify this process in and by pumping electrons with a homogeneous pumping rate @xmath49 , which is proportional to the optical pumping intensity in an experiment .",
    "this simplification is valid only if the gain slab is thin and the gain of the laser is low , because the real pumping rate depends on the local optical intensity and should be a function of position . we ll discuss this in more detail in . based on this simplification , we can have the rate equations as follows , @xmath50 correspondingly , we only need to consider the electric polarization density @xmath51 on the atomic transition between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in and .    in order to solve the behavior of the gain materials in the electromagnetic fields numerically , the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method",
    "is utilized @xcite . at the left and right ends of the computational space , perfect matched layers ( pml )",
    "are used to impose the absorbing boundary condition ( abc ) . in the fdtd calculations ,",
    "both the space and time are discretized into small steps compared to the characteristic space and time periods . in our simulations presented below , the discrete time and space steps are chosen to be @xmath52 and @xmath53 in and , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 in .",
    "the initial condition is that all electrons are in the ground state and all electric , magnetic and polarization fields are zero .",
    "then the electrons are pumped from @xmath5 to @xmath6 optically or with a homogeneous pumping rate @xmath49 .",
    "the system begins to evolve according to the equations above .",
    "to understand the lasing behavior of gain material , we first study a gain material slab surrounded by vacuum ( shown in ) .",
    "we generate a continuous wave ( cw ) at the frequency @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and let it propagate through the gain slab , and then we calculate the reflected and transmitted waves and implement the fourier transforms to see if there is lasing and how much power is emitted around @xmath60  the emission frequency @xmath61 between @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "first we start with a very low input power @xmath62 for the incident cw wave , but no lasing happens , then we increase the input power till it reaches the lasing threshold , for which the system starts to have lasing and we can see a small peak at the emission frequency @xmath63 in the fourier transforms of reflected and transmitted waves , i.e. , low power emitted around the emission frequency @xmath61 . if we keep increasing the input power , the peak will get higher and the emitted power will get larger .",
    "shows the transmitted waves and their corresponding fourier transforms for three different input powers at the gain slab @xmath64 .",
    "we can see there is no lasing ( ) when the input power is low ( @xmath65 ) and there is only one peak for the pumping frequency in its fourier transform ( ) . when the input power @xmath66 , the system starts lasing ( ) and a small peak appears at the frequency @xmath60 ( ) . if we increase the input power to a higher value @xmath67 , the lasing gets stronger ( ) and the peak for the emission frequency gets higher ( ) , i.e. , more power emitted around the emission frequency @xmath61 .",
    "we have calculated the emitted power at the emission frequency @xmath61 versus the input power at the pumping frequency @xmath58 for the same gain slab system . as shown in , we can see that there is a sharp rise in the emission around @xmath68 , which corresponds to the lasing threshold for this system . below the threshold , there is no lasing .",
    "+    we also notice that the lasing time ( the time when the system starts lasing ) varies according to the input power .",
    "shows the detailed results for the lasing time versus the input power with the slab width @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we can see the lasing time decreases as the input power increases because the system pumps the electrons at a higher rate from the ground state level to higher levels and then reaches the population inversion between @xmath9 and @xmath8 in a shorter time . for a fixed input power",
    ", one can see the lasing time decreases as the gain slab width gets larger .",
    "this occurs because more input energy is absorbed and then converted to lasing by the wider gain slab .    as the input wave propagates inside the gain slab",
    ", it will decay due to the absorption from the gain material at the pumping frequency @xmath58 ( see ) .",
    "thus the pumping rate , which is determined by the local input optical intensity , is inhomogeneous inside the gain slab .",
    "but for a thin gain material layer , the electric field of the input wave can be approximately treated as homogeneous , thus we can simplify the pumping process between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by using a homogeneous pumping rate @xmath49 . for a very thin gain slab @xmath64 ,",
    "simulations are done with a homogeneous pumping rate and the results for the power emitted around the emission frequency @xmath61 versus the pumping rate are plotted in . comparing with , where the electrons are optically pumped , we can see they are very similar . for a fixed output power such as @xmath71",
    ", we can find the corresponding input power @xmath72 in and the corresponding pumping rate @xmath73 in .",
    "then we do simulations for optical pumping case with the input power @xmath72 and for the homogeneous pumping rate case with the pumping rate @xmath73 .",
    "the graphs of the occupation numbers as a function time are plotted in for both cases .",
    "one can see that they are almost the same .",
    "this verifies that the homogeneous pumping rate simplification is valid for a thin gain slab . in our following simulations",
    ", we ll use this simplification because the gain slab widths in our structures are very thin ( @xmath74 ) .      as the first simple model system",
    ", we will discuss a one - dimensional metamaterial system which consists of layers of negative index material ( nim ) and gain material , as shown in , to see if we can compensate the losses of the metamaterials associated with the nims by the amplification provided by the gain material layers and how the system starts lasing .",
    "we first let a narrow band gaussian pulse of a given amplitude go through the metamaterial without gain , and we calculate the transmitted signal emerging from the metamaterial system , which also has a gaussian profile but its amplitude is much smaller than that of the incident pulse due to the losses of nim layers .",
    "then we introduce the gain into the system and start increasing the pumping rate .",
    "the amplitude of the transmitted signal gets larger and we can find a critical pumping rate , for which the transmitted pulse is of the same amplitude as the incident one .",
    "since the gain material itself is nonlinear , we increase the amplitude of the incident gaussian pulse for a fixed pumping rate to see how high we can go in the strength of the incident electric field and still have the full compensation of the losses , i.e. , the transmitted signal equals the incident signal , independent on the signal strength . in this region",
    "we have compensated loss and still have linear response of the metamaterial .",
    "the shape of the transmitted signal is only affected by the dispersion but not dependent on the signal strength . for a three - layer system ( nim - gain material - nim ) , we have calculated the transmission versus the strength of the electric field of the incident signal for several pumping rates close to the critical pumping rate @xmath75 , as shown in .",
    "we found it has a linear response within a very broad range up to incident electric field of @xmath76 .",
    "if we use 19 layers of , the critical pumping rate is @xmath77 , which is even smaller than half of the three - layer case , and the linear regime becomes narrower and drops faster than the 3-layer case for higher strength of incident electric field ( shown in ) . to include the nonlinearity of gain material for strong incident signal , it is necessary to do a self - consistent calculation using fdtd method .",
    ", for different pumping rates @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath49 is increased from @xmath78 ( lowest ) to @xmath79 ( highest ) in steps of @xmath80 .",
    "the material parameters for nim are @xmath81 .",
    "the metamaterial response is linear in a very wide range . when the loss - compensated transmission reaches exactly unity , the pumping rate @xmath82 , which is called the critical pumping rate . for incident fields stronger than @xmath83",

    "shows there exists a linear relation between the critical pumping rate and the imaginary part of the refractive index @xmath2 of nims .     at the critical pumping rates @xmath84 .",
    "the material parameters for nim are same as . for incident fields stronger than @xmath76",
    "this metamaterial becomes non - linear.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have also numerically calculated the susceptibilities of the gain material to see if it really has a lorentzian lineshape .",
    "we first let a gaussian pulse of a given amplitude ( @xmath85 ) propagate through the metamaterial system and calculate the time - domain electric polarization @xmath86 and the local electric field @xmath87 .",
    "then we implement the fourier transforms to obtain the frequency - domain polarization and electric fields and calculate the frequency - dependent susceptibility by using the equation @xmath88 .",
    "simulations are done for both 3 and 19 layers and results are compared with the analytic results calculated using the equations @xcite @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 . as shown in , we found that the numerical susceptibilities are the same as the analytic ones and they do have a lorentzian lineshape .     of nims .",
    "the structure is a three - layer system ( nim - gain material - nim ) and @xmath94 for nims.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to understand the lasing behavior of the metamaterial system , we increase the pumping rate to provide more gain from the gain material .",
    "we found the amplification of the incident signal gets larger and at last the system starts lasing till the pumping rate reaches a certain high value .",
    "shows the lasing behavior at the pumping rate @xmath95 and there appears a peak at the emission frequency @xmath60 in the corresponding fourier transform ( ) .",
    "if we use real metal layers instead of negative index materials , we can not compensate the losses of the metals .",
    "the reason is that the permittivity @xmath96 for metals is large and negative and we ll have large reflections due to the impedance mismatch .      in",
    ", we simply force the permittivity and the permeability of the metamaterial to be negative to have an unrealistic negative index material . in this section ,",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) metamaterial system ( shown in ) which consists of one layer of gain material and two layers of dielectric wires that have a lorentz - type resonant electric response to emulate the resonant elements in a realistic metamaterial , such as cut - wires .    , where the resonance frequency @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and @xmath99 takes different values in the cases we have examined .",
    "the dimensions are @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     +    we first study the three - layer system of with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath103 for lorentz dielectric ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 for gain .",
    "the transmission , @xmath106 , the reflection , @xmath107 , and the absorption , @xmath108 , as a function of frequency for the system are obtained in the propagation direction . with the introduction of gain ,",
    "the absorption at the resonance frequency of @xmath60 decreases and reaches 0 at a certain pumping rate .",
    "so the gain compensates the losses .",
    "if we continue increasing the gain , i.e. , the pumping rate , the system gets overcompensated and the absorption becomes negative . to see how the losses of the emulated resonators get compensated by the gain",
    ", we exploit the usual retrieval procedure based on inverting the scattering amplitudes @xcite to obtain the effective permittivities @xmath96 without gain and with gain .",
    "( a ) - 16(c ) show the retrieved results for the real and the imaginary parts of the effective permittivities @xmath96 of the system for the below compensation , loss - compensated , and overcompensated cases , respectively , together with the effective permittivity without gain .",
    "the retrieved results for @xmath96 without gain have exactly the lorentzian shape but the amplitude of the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath96 is a factor of 4 less than the lorentz formula for the square cylinders .",
    "this is due to the filling ratio of the square cylinders in the unit cell . due to the loss compensation from the gain material",
    ", one can see the imaginary part of the effective permittivity gets lower as the gain increases .",
    "below compensation , its value at the resonance frequency of @xmath60 is positive , while it s zero and negative for the loss - compensated and overcompensated cases , respectively .",
    "notice that we can have @xmath109 with @xmath110 at @xmath111 and @xmath112 with @xmath110 at @xmath113 for the below compensation case ( ) . for the loss - compensated case ( ) , we have @xmath114 with @xmath110 at the resonance frequency @xmath60 , which is just same as vacuum and makes no sense for us .",
    "for the overcompensated case ( ) , the imaginary part of the effective permittivity @xmath96 is negative within all the frequency range .",
    "second , we study the three - layer system with the fwhm of gain smaller than lorentz dielectric , where the bandwidths for gain and lorentz dielectric are @xmath103 and @xmath105 ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) , respectively .",
    "the introduction of gain develops a peak at the resonance frequency of @xmath60 for the transmission while the absorption has a dip .",
    "the retrieved results for the real and the imaginary parts of the effective permittivities @xmath96 without gain and with gain are plotted in - 16(f ) for the three different cases discussed above .",
    "similar to the first case we examined where the loss bandwidth is smaller than the gain , the imaginary part of the effective permittivity @xmath96 gets smaller due to the gain .",
    "the difference is we get interesting results for the overcompensated case instead of the below compensation case , where we can have @xmath116 with @xmath117 at @xmath118 and @xmath119 with @xmath117 at @xmath120 .",
    "so for both the two systems , one can obtain a lossless metamaterial with positive or negative @xmath121 , either below compensation or over compensation .",
    "in we also have plotted the sum of @xmath122 without gain and the imaginary part of @xmath123 , the dielectric function of the gain material .",
    "one can see the imaginary part of @xmath96 of our total system with gain is equal to the sum of @xmath122 and @xmath124 .",
    "this is unexpected because there is no coupling between the lorentz dielectric and the gain .",
    "this is indeed true for the 2d lorentz dielectric cylinders , because they have a continuous shape like a solenoid and the gain material slabs have zero depolarization field .",
    "different from finite length wires [ hence a three - dimensional ( 3d ) problem ] where the dipole interactions between lorentz wires and gain material are dominated by the near field @xmath125 , the interaction for infinite length wires is only via the propagating field @xmath126 , and much weaker .",
    "that s why the lorentz wires and the gain material are approximately independent in our 2d simulations .",
    "so there is a need for a true 3d simulation to solve this problem and obtain different behaviors .",
    "however , the 3d simulation is computationally excessively demanding .    like the layered system in ,",
    "if we keep increasing the pumping rate , i.e. , the gain , at last both of the two systems will have lasing .",
    "for example , when the pumping rate reaches @xmath127 , the three - layer system with gain bandwidth @xmath103 and lorentz bandwidth @xmath105 starts lasing  the system itself has a coherent self - sustained steady output .      to avoid the decoupling problem in and still limit our simulations in a 2d model , we consider a 2d split ring resonator ( srr ) as a more realistic and also more relevant model , where the relevant polarization is across the finite srr gap and therefore the coupling to the gain material is dipolelike . in , we show the geometry for the unit cell of the srr system with the gain material embedded in the gap .",
    "the dimensions of the srr are chosen such that the magnetic resonance frequency of the srr overlaps with the emission frequency ( @xmath60 ) of the gain material . due to the strong electric field inside the gap",
    ", there will be strong coupling between the srr and the gain material .",
    "we also want to see if the losses of the magnetic response can be compensated by the electric gain .",
    "simulations are done for one layer of the square srr with gain bandwidth of @xmath105 .",
    "shows the retrieved results for the real and the imaginary parts of the effective permeability @xmath128 , with gain ( pumping rate @xmath129 ) and without gain .",
    "one can see that with the introduction of gain , the gain undamps the magnetic resonance of the srr and the weak and broad resonant effective permeability @xmath128 of the lossy srr becomes strong and narrow .",
    "the fwhm with gain is @xmath130 , while the fwhm without gain is @xmath131 , which is more than twice larger than the former .",
    "notice that in the off - resonance range in , we can obtain the effective permeability @xmath128 with a smaller imaginary part with the introduction of the gain , which means the magnetic loss is compensated by the electric gain .",
    "shows the retrieved results for the real and the imaginary parts of the corresponding effective index of refraction @xmath2 , with and without gain .",
    "note that for a lossless srr , @xmath2 is purely real away from the resonance except in a small band above the resonance where it s purely imaginary due to the negative @xmath128 . at the frequency of @xmath132 , slightly below the resonance ( ) ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the index of refraction @xmath2 without and with gain are @xmath133 and @xmath134",
    ". then we can find the effective extinction coefficient without gain is @xmath135 and the one with gain is @xmath136 . and",
    "hence the effective amplification coefficient of the gain in the combined system is @xmath137 , which is much larger than the amplification @xmath138 for the bulk gain material @xcite at the given pumping rate @xmath129 .",
    "this is due to the strong local electric field enhancement in the gap of the resonant srr .",
    "while we have the incident electric field @xmath85 , the induced electric field in the gap is around @xmath139 . taking the observed field enhancement factor around 45 in the gap of srr , the energy produced by the gain in the gap is around @xmath140 times larger than by the homogeneous bulk gain material in the size of the unit cell , which agrees well with the factor around 15 between the simulated srr effective medium and the homogeneous gain medium . if we continue increasing the pumping rate , the magnetic resonance becomes narrower ( @xmath141 for pumping rate @xmath142 ) .",
    "when the pumping rate reaches @xmath143 , the metamaterial system gets overcompensated and the imaginary part of the effective permeability @xmath128 at the resonance frequency gets flipped down and becomes negative .",
    "if we increase the pumping rate even more ( around @xmath144 ) , the srr system starts lasing @xcite .    instead of having the gain in the gap of srr",
    ", we also have done simulations on the srr system where the gain is surrounding around the srr . the retrieved results for the real and the imaginary parts of the effective permeability @xmath128 without gain and with gain for a given pumping rate @xmath145 are plotted in . due to the larger gain",
    "filling in the unit cell , the coupling between the gain material and the srr gets stronger and the losses of srr are easier to be compensated . compared with the case with the gain in the gap only , the effective permeability @xmath128 of the simulated srr system in can have stronger and narrower resonance ( fwhm = @xmath146 ) even with lower pumping rate .",
    "similar to the previous case , the magnetic resonance becomes stronger and narrower ( @xmath147 at @xmath129 ) as we increase the pumping rate , and the system gets overcompensated so that the magnetic resonance peak gets flipped down when the pumping rate reaches @xmath148 .",
    "it s also easier for this system to have lasing @xcite , which is observed when the pumping rate is @xmath149 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations on one dimensional gain material system by using fdtd method .",

    "the lasing is faster .",
    "comparisons were done for a gain material slab between the optical pump method and its homogeneous pumping rate simplification and results show that this simplification can be valid for a thin gain slab .",
    "a self - consistent model incorporating the gain into dispersive metamaterial nanostructure was proposed and numerically solved .",
    "we numerically show that the losses of dispersive metamaterials can be compensated by gain by investigating the transmission , reflection and absorption data as well as the retrieved effective parameters .",
    "there is a relatively wide range of input signal amplitudes where the metamaterial - gain system behaves linearly .",
    "when the amplitudes get higher , the system becomes nonlinear due to the nonlinearity of the gain material itself .",
    "it s necessary to have self - consistent calculations to determine the signal range where we can expect linear response .",

    "two srr systems with different gain inclusions were studied .",
    "we have demonstrated that the magnetic losses of the srrs can be easily compensated by the electric gain .",
