    "<S> in contrast to empirical water models  @xcite , which depend on experimental data resulting in a limited transferability , in aimd the atomic forces that govern the molecular dynamics are obtained directly from quantum mechanics . while this approach is in principle exact ( in combination with methods that account for the quantum nature of the nuclei  @xcite ) , _ ab initio _ simulations of condensed matter systems are feasible only if approximate but efficient methods such as density - functional theory ( dft ) are employed . even then , however , simulations are restricted to short times and small systems . </S>",
    "<S> aimd simulations have been employed to a limited extent to investigate the phase behavior of water , for instance by estimating melting temperatures  @xcite and vapor - liquid coexistence curves  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , we present a series of analytic potentials which accurately represent the _ ab initio _ potential - energy surface of water and overcome the computational bottleneck of aimd simulations , enabling to assess the performance of different density - functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the potentials is not constructed employing simplified physically motivated models , but instead consists of a set of highly flexible functions in form of artificial neural networks  @xcite trained to a broad range of condensed phase configurations . using this powerful approach we carry out converged large - scale molecular dynamics simulations of water and clarify the significance of vdw interactions for the thermodynamic anomalies of water . </S>"
