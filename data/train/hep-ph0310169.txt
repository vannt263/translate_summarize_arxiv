    "since in massless qcd the multiparticle hadronic states are generated only by a nonperturbative confinement mechanism , these singularities can show up only beyond perturbation theory .",
    "however , the perturbative amplitudes themselves are expected to have a complicated structure of singularities , due to the fact that the perturbation series is divergent and borel non - summable .",

    ", arguments based on analyticity in the coupling complex plane were used to suggest the possibility of calculating genuine nonperturbative quantities , like qcd condensates , from pure perturbation theory .",
    "the analytic structure and its connection with infrared renormalons were further discussed in @xcite .",
    "motivated by this recent interest in the problem , we investigate in the present work the analytic structure in the complex coupling plane of the borel - summed amplitudes in perturbative qcd .",
    "we use the mathematical techniques applied in @xcite , which allow us to express the borel integral as a dispersion relation in the coupling plane . in the last section",
    "we shall make a few comments on the papers @xcite .",
    "we consider for illustration the adler function in massless qcd @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the current - current correlation function calculated for euclidian arguments @xmath5 .",
    "it is known that the perturbation expansion of @xmath6 in powers of the renormalized coupling @xmath7 is divergent and not borel summable ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the attempts of performing the summation by a formal borel - laplace integral @xcite encounter the difficulty that this integral is not well - defined .",
    "we consider the borel transform @xmath8 defined in the standard way in terms of the perturbative coefficients @xmath9 of @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the first qcd beta - function coefficient with @xmath13 the number of flavors .",
    "it is known , from the @xmath14 large order growth of @xmath9 , that @xmath8 has singularities ( ultraviolet and infrared renormalons ) on the real axis of the @xmath15-plane @xcite . for the adler function , the ultraviolet renormalons are placed along the range @xmath16 and the infrared renormalons along @xmath17 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . due to the infrared renormalons ,",
    "the usual borel - laplace integral is not well - defined and requires an integration prescription . defining @xmath18",
    "one can adopt as prescription , for each value of @xmath0 with @xmath19 , either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , or a linear combination of them , with coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 such as to correctly reproduce the known low - order expansion of @xmath6 ( which is obtained by truncating the taylor expansion ( [ b ] ) at a finite order @xmath24 ) .",
    "we consider in particular the principal value ( @xmath25 ) prescription @xmath26\\,.\\ ] ] once a prescription is adopted , one has a well - defined function of @xmath0 , different prescriptions yielding different functions . in the next section we shall study the analytic properties of these functions in the complex @xmath0-plane .",
    "the analytic properties of the integrals ( [ pm ] ) with respect to the variable @xmath0 can be studied with standard mathematical techniques . in the present work ,",
    "we use the method of inverse mellin transform , applied for the first time in the context of borel summation in qcd in @xcite . for details of the mathematical procedure used below ,",
    "we refer to @xcite , where the same method was applied for investigating the momentum - plane analyticity structure of the adler function in the large-@xmath27 limit .",
    "the inverse mellin transform of the function @xmath28 is defined by @xcite @xmath29 and admits the inverse relation @xmath30 which gives @xmath31 in the strip @xmath32 parallel to the imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "the above relations are valid if the borel transform satisfies the condition @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a point located on the real axis , between the branch points , @xmath35 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this condition strongly restricts the asymptotic behaviour of the borel transform , and it is not known whether it is obeyed or not in qcd .",
    "the condition ( [ l2b ] ) is however satisfied in some particular cases of physical interest .",
    "one example is the summation of a chain of diagrams in the large-@xmath27 ( or large-@xmath13 limit ) , which leads to the borel transform @xcite : @xmath36 ^ 2 } \\,,\\ ] ] working in the @xmath37-scheme , where all the exponential factors are included in the definition of the coupling . as a second example",
    "we take the case of a finite number of renormalons with branch - point singularities , in particular the contribution to @xmath8 of the leading infrared and ultraviolet renormalons @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the strength of the corresponding singularities . we note that for the adler function @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 were calculated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath47 defined in ( [ wd ] ) can be calculated by closing the integration contour along a semi - circle at infinity in the @xmath15 plane and applying the theorem of residues .",
    "for @xmath48 the contribution of the semi - circle at infinity vanishes if the contour is closed in the right half of the @xmath15 plane , while for @xmath49 the contour must be closed in the left half plane .",
    "therefore one obtains different expressions for the distribution function at @xmath48 and @xmath49 . by cauchy s theorem these functions , which we denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , have the representations @xmath52 the integration ( hankel ) contours @xmath53 and @xmath54 being indicated in fig . 1 .",
    "the inverse mellin transform @xmath55 was calculated in ref .",

    "the physical interpretation of @xmath55 as the distribution of the internal gluon virtualities in feynman diagrams was also pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath55 can be also calculated explicitly for a finite number of renormalons with branch - point singularities .",
    "for instance , for the borel transform written in ( [ bfirst ] ) we obtain @xcite : @xmath58    we now proceed to the evaluation of the integrals ( [ pm ] ) , taking @xmath0 in the right half plane , @xmath19 , where we assume that they converge .",

    "the relations ( [ dp1 ] ) , ( [ dm1 ] ) and ( [ dif ] ) are the basis the derivation of the dispersion relations given below .",
    "we first note that , unlike the original representations ( [ pm ] ) which converge only for @xmath68 , the representations ( [ dp1 ] ) and ( [ dm1 ] ) can be analytically continued in the corresponding upper ( lower ) half of the complex @xmath0 plane , outside the real axis . moreover , it is easy to convert them into a dispersion representation in the variable @xmath0 .",
    "we first split the integral in two integrals , one from 0 to 1 ( where @xmath69 ) , and the other from 1 to @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 ) , and perform in each interval the change of variable @xmath72 using the relations ( [ dp1])-([dm1 ] ) thus transformed , together with ( [ dif ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , we finally express @xmath20 as @xmath73 from the definition ( [ sigma ] ) and the properties of the inverse mellin transform @xmath55 , it follows that the function @xmath74 can be analytically continued in the complex @xmath0-plane .",
    "this property is seen explicitly in the case of one infrared renormalon in ( [ sigma1 ] ) .",

    "therefore , the spectral functions of the dispersion integrals are real .    taken together , the dispersion relations ( [ drap ] ) define a single analytic function , @xmath20 , in the whole cut @xmath0-plane .",
    "this function may have a discontinuity across the positive axis , due the cauchy dispersion integral along @xmath78 and the additional term @xmath79 in the second relation .",
    "a simple calculation shows however that @xmath80 where p denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "this relation shows that the function @xmath20 is well defined along the positive axis , but has there an unphysical imaginary part equal to @xmath81 from ( [ drap ] ) it follows that @xmath20 has actually a discontinuity along the negative axis , given by @xmath82 \\,,\\quad a<0\\,,\\ ] ] in terms of the real spectral function @xmath83 and the analytic continuation of @xmath84 up to the lower edge of the negative semiaxis ( where , as seen from ( [ sigma1 ] ) , it is complex ) .    the function @xmath21 satisfies a dispersion relation similar to ( [ drap ] ) , with an additional term @xmath85 in the right hand side , as follows from ( [ dif ] ) . as above",
    ", one can show that @xmath21 is well - defined for @xmath77 , but it assumes there complex values .",
    "the unphysical imaginary part is eliminated if we adopt the principal value prescription defined in ( [ pv ] ) , for which we obtain : @xmath86 for @xmath0 on the positive semiaxis , is easy to check that @xmath87 therefore , @xmath88 is well - defined and real on the positive real semiaxis , as required by general principles .",

    "@xcite ) .    we point out that the imaginary part of @xmath88 along the positive semiaxis vanished due to a precise cancellation of the imaginary part of the integrals and the last terms in eqs .",

    "it is easy to check that for a general linear combination of @xmath93 , with coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 as discussed above ( [ pv ] ) , this cancellation no longer holds .",
    "therefore , the principal value prescription is the most suitable choice if one wants to preserve in perturbative qcd the analytic properties of the true amplitudes .    in this section",
    ", we obtained the nontrivial result that the inverse mellin transform can be used to derive from ( [ pm ] ) dispersion relations for the perturbative amplitudes @xmath94 , which allow an analytic continuation of the borel integral into the left - hand half - plane @xmath95 and explicitly exhibit the singularities and the discontinuities across the cuts",
    ".    the results obtained here , besides expressing the borel integral ( [ pm ] ) in the more suitable form of a dispersion relation , will be useful in discussing the validity of some assumptions on analyticity in the @xmath0 plane made in the literature , as we show in the next section .",

    "( 17 ) of @xcite , derived using arguments based on regularity with respect to the parameter @xmath45 .    the analytic structure in the coupling constant plane was recently considered also in ref .",
    "@xcite , where arguments based on analyticity were used in support of the claim that the qcd condensates can be determined using the coefficients of the perturbation series . in",
    "what follows we shall briefly analyse the validity of this claim .",
    "the author of @xcite uses the analogy with some semiclassical models @xcite , where a specific contribution ( for instance , multi - instantons ) is regular for negative couplings and can be obtained for positive couplings by analytic continuation .",
    "he invokes the heuristic argument according to which a perturbation series with a sign - nonalternating , @xmath14 large order behavior , can be summed at @xmath76 by a borel integral along the negative axis in the @xmath15-plane , where it becomes sign alternating .",
    "we note however that sign alternation does not necessarily imply borel summability : this property is violated if a nonalternating component is present , however negligible it may be in comparison with a strong sign - alternating component of the series .",
    "this is exactly the situation in qcd : due to the ultraviolet renormalons , the borel integral along the negative @xmath15-axis is not well defined .",
    "another conjecture adopted in @xcite is related to the nonperturbative amplitude @xmath99 , which must be added to @xmath6 in order to compensate its unphysical imaginary part : @xmath100 according to current interpretations @xcite , the cancellation is expected to occur if both terms in the above relation are calculated with the same prescription . in @xcite the author supplements ( [ cond ] ) by a specific assumption about the nonperturbative amplitude , taking it of the form @xmath101 where @xmath45 is the branch - point exponent of the infrared renormalon in ( [ bfirst ] ) and @xmath102 is related to the gluon condensate ( we use the parametrization given in @xcite , with our notation @xmath103 ) .",
    "this expression is regular for negative @xmath0 , having a discontinuity _ only _ on the positive semiaxis in the @xmath0-plane , where @xmath104 \\ , , \\quad a>0\\,.\\ ] ] using this relation and the imaginary part of the perturbative amplitude given in ( [ i m ] ) and ( [ sigma1 ] ) , condition ( [ cond ] ) gives the relation @xmath105 from which , according to @xcite , one could obtain the nonperturbative parameter @xmath102 ( the gluon condensate ) , using the strength @xmath41 of the infrared renormalon computed from the perturbation series .",
    "the relation ( [ residue ] ) implies that @xmath41 vanishes for nonnegative integer @xmath45 , when the renormalon @xmath106 becomes a pole .",
    "it is known however that poles are actually obtained from some chains of feynman diagrams , in the large-@xmath27 ( or large-@xmath13 ) limit @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the author discusses this limit , taking the exponent @xmath45 of the form @xmath107 , with @xmath108 an integer . in this limit ,",
    "the factor @xmath109 in the denominator of ( [ residue ] ) is compensated by the factor @xmath27 in the numerator , leading to a finite nonzero limit for @xmath41 , if @xmath102 tends to a nonzero constant in the large-@xmath27 limit .",
    "but then eq . ( [ dnp ] ) implies that the real part of the nonperturbative amplitude @xmath110 is nonvanishing in this limit ( we keep , following @xcite , the product @xmath111 constant , which is legitimate , as seen in particular in the one - loop expression @xmath112 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the perturbative amplitude @xmath113 is subleading for large @xmath27 , due to the factor @xmath114 in front of the laplace - borel integral ( [ pm ] ) .",
    "a choice of the constant @xmath102 of the same order , i.e. @xmath115 , would imply from ( [ residue ] ) that @xmath41 vanishes when @xmath116 .",
    "so , it follows from @xcite that in the large-@xmath117 limit either the total adler function is dominated by the real part of the nonperturbative amplitude , or the renormalon residue vanishes .",
    "the above implications depend however , in a crucial way , on the conjecture made in @xcite that the only singularities of the nonperturbative amplitude are along the positive semiaxis .",
    "actually , singularities along the negative semiaxis ( produced by the ultraviolet renormalons in the ope coefficients ) can not be excluded . in @xcite",
    "it is claimed that the influence of the ultraviolet renormalons can be suppressed by an appropriate conformal mapping @xcite . a numerical suppression , however",
    ", does not imply removal of the corresponding singularities . as is shown in @xcite , even if @xmath8 is expanded in powers of the optimal conformal mapping of the borel plane @xcite",
    ", the function @xmath6 does have singularities along the negative semiaxis .",
    "therefore , the general expression of @xmath99 may have singularities both for @xmath77 and for @xmath76 . to give an example ,",
    "we add to ( [ dnp ] ) the analogous branch - point term suggested by eq.([delta ] ) , taking @xmath118 where @xmath102 and @xmath119 depend in general on @xmath45 and @xmath120 is complex ( as the condition ( [ cond ] ) holds in a definite prescription , we specifically refer here to the prescription leading to @xmath121 )",
    ". then condition ( [ cond ] ) gives @xmath122 which does not necessarily imply that @xmath41 vanishes when @xmath45 is a nonnegative integer .",
    "moreover , the real part of the nonperturbative amplitude ( [ dnp1 ] ) contains the additional parameter @xmath123 not specified by the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , which , combined with the first term in the expression ( [ dnp1 ] ) can make @xmath124 subleading in the large-@xmath27 limit .",
    "this counterexample disproves the conclusions ( that appear to be inherent in the method of @xcite ) that the renormalon residue vanishes when the singularity is a pole , or the amplitude is dominated in the large-@xmath27 limit by the nonperturbative part .",
    "even more important , however , is the fact that the real part of the nonperturbative amplitude can not be determined from the requirement ( [ cond ] ) and analyticity arguments .",
    "the possibility , advocated in @xcite , of obtaining the gluon condensate from the perturbation series fails to work here .    in the present paper , by using the inverse mellin transform , we showed that the borel - summed qcd perturbative amplitudes ( [ pm ] ) satisfy dispersion relations which explicitly exhibit the singularities in the complex @xmath0-plane and the discontinuities across the cuts , and also allow the analytic continuation of the borel integral into the left - hand half - plane @xmath95 .",
    "we saw that the derivation relies on some special hypotheses about the properties of the borel transform in perturbative qcd : we namely assumed that the borel transform has no singularities in the complex @xmath15-plane except for branch - points on the real axis , with a holomorphy gap around the origin , its asymptotic behavior being such that the inequality ( [ l2b ] ) holds and the inverse mellin transform ( [ wd ] ) exists .",
    "we point out that the holomorphy of @xmath8 in the double - cut @xmath15-plane is expected on general grounds to hold in renormalisable field theories @xcite .",
    "the validity of this condition in qcd is presently almost universally adopted as a plausible assumption . as for the asymptotic condition ,",
    "its validity in full qcd is not guaranteed , but it is satisfied in the large-@xmath27 limit and for a finite number of renormalons with branch - point singularities .    in the second part of the paper we made some comments on the papers @xcite , where arguments based on analyticity were used to discuss the connection between renormalons and nonperturbative quantities in qcd .",
    "we investigated some specific conjectures made in @xcite and showed that they are in conflict with the analyticity properties related to the ultraviolet and infrared renormalons , which throws doubts on the method of calculating qcd condensates from perturbative expansions .",
