    "accretion discs are found around black holes in the centres of active galaxies and also in galactic x - ray binary stars .",
    "these systems may form in such a way that the angular momentum vectors of the disc and of the black hole are not parallel . as a particle in a tilted orbit around a rotating black hole undergoes lense  thirring precession at a rate dependent on the radius of the orbit , so a tilted disc experiences a gravitomagnetic torque that tends to twist and warp the disc .",
    "if the disc is able to communicate a warping disturbance in a diffusive manner as a result of its pressure and viscosity , it may adopt a characteristic warped shape in which the plane of the disc undergoes a smooth transition from one plane to another in the vicinity of a certain radius ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ; kumar & pringle 1985 ; scheuer & feiler 1996 ) . at large radius",
    "the disc is essentially flat and its plane is determined by the total angular momentum vector of the disc . at small radius",
    "the disc is essentially flat and lies in the equatorial plane of the black hole . over a longer time - scale",
    "the disc and hole tend towards mutual alignment ( scheuer & feiler 1996 ; natarajan & pringle 1998 )",
    ".    however , there are circumstances in which a warping disturbance propagates in a wavelike , rather than diffusive , manner .",
    "this occurs in a keplerian disc when the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath0 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is smaller than the angular semi - thickness @xmath1 of the disc ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ; wijers & pringle 1999 ; see the discussion by pringle 1999 ) ; in a non - keplerian disc the propagation is also wavelike , although it is dispersive ( ogilvie 1999 ) . the evolution of a disc around a rotating black hole under these conditions has received less attention . on the basis of analytical calculations , demianski & ivanov ( 1997 ) and ivanov & illarionov ( 1997 ) found that the disc can adopt a steady warped shape in which the tilt angle is an oscillatory function of radius .",
    "more recently , nelson & papaloizou ( 2000 ) conducted smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of accretion discs around rotating black holes under a variety of assumptions .",
    "they did not find the tilt oscillations , but found that the inner part of the disc was aligned with the equatorial plane of the hole .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the shape of a warped disc around a kerr black hole , under conditions such that the warp propagates in a wavelike manner .",
    "we explore the reasons for the existence of a steady wavelike solution , and discuss the expected wavelength , amplitude and phase of the oscillations in disc tilt . using time - dependent calculations of the linearized equations , we study the process by which such a steady solution is established .",
    "finally , we discuss the potentially important implications of the shape of the disc for the directionality of jets emanating from discs around black holes .",
    "the propagation of warping disturbances of small amplitude in a nearly keplerian and nearly inviscid disc has been discussed by papaloizou & lin ( 1995 ) , masset & tagger ( 1996 ) , demianski & ivanov ( 1997 ) , pringle ( 1999 ) and lubow & ogilvie ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors differ in respect of the notations and assumptions they adopt , but all agree that bending waves propagate approximately non - dispersively under these conditions , with a wave speed that is somewhat less than the average sound speed of the disc .",
    "we consider disturbances of a steady disc of surface density @xmath2 and vertically integrated pressure @xmath3 defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 are cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the orbital angular velocity , the epicyclic frequency and the vertical oscillation frequency associated with circular orbits at radius @xmath9 from the central object . after an integration by parts , and using the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium of the disc , we find @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an effective density scale - height . in the case of a vertically isothermal disc ,",
    "@xmath12 is equal to the usual gaussian scale - height .",
    "a simple way to describe a warped disc is as a continuous set of tilted circular rings , and to define a unit tilt vector @xmath13 normal to the plane of the ring of radius @xmath9 at time @xmath14 . when the disc is only slightly tilted out of the @xmath15-plane , @xmath16 .",
    "as shown by lubow & ogilvie ( 2000 ) , the equations governing warping disturbances of small amplitude in a nearly keplerian and nearly inviscid disc may be written in the form @xmath17 @xmath18 equation ( [ dldt ] ) is derived from the vertical component of the equation of motion , and can be understood as expressing the conservation of horizontal angular momentum : @xmath19 is the horizontal internal torque in the disc , and @xmath20 is the horizontal external torque , per unit area , acting on the disc .",
    "equation ( [ dgvecdt ] ) is derived from the horizontal components of the equation of motion , and determines the internal torque @xmath21 .",
    "the internal torque is mediated by shearing epicyclic motions , driven by the radial pressure gradients that are set up when a stratified disc is warped .",
    "these motions undergo apsidal precession when @xmath22 , and also viscous decay , here described by a dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 appears in equation ( [ dgvecdt ] ) only to quantify the rate , @xmath23 , at which the shearing epicyclic motions associated with the warp decay .",
    "although this term is derived from a viscous model , numerical simulations of the interaction of shearing epicyclic motions with three - dimensional magnetorotational turbulence ( torkelsson et al . 2000 ) , and an analytical closure model of such turbulence ( ogilvie 2002 ) , both suggest that small - amplitude shearing epicyclic motions decay exponentially in time .",
    "the measured rate is in fact through to be somewhat smaller than @xmath23 if @xmath0 is calibrated in the usual way with reference to the @xmath24-component of the turbulent stress .",
    "it is often more convenient to adopt a complex representation in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 . then @xmath27=    { { 1}\\over{r}}{{\\partial g}\\over{\\partial r } } ,    \\label{dwdt}\\ ] ] @xmath28 note that the external torque is related to the non - sphericity of the potential , and therefore to the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , @xmath31 represents the tilt of the disc at each radius in the sense that @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the amplitude of the local tilt and @xmath34 is the azimuth ( cf .",
    "pringle 1996 ) .",
    "these equations are known to be valid when the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 are sufficiently small , and vary on a length - scale long compared to @xmath12 and on a time - scale long compared to @xmath37 . in deriving them",
    "it is also assumed that the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath0 are of order @xmath1 or smaller .    in the absence of viscosity , the dispersion relation associated with this system , for wavelike solutions with a rapidly varying phase factor @xmath40 , is @xmath41    \\left[\\omega-\\left({{\\omega^2-\\kappa^2}\\over{2\\omega}}\\right)\\right]=    { { 1}\\over{4}}k^2h^2\\omega_z^2 .",
    "\\label{dispersion}\\ ] ] this shows that , in an exactly keplerian disc , the warp propagates as a non - dispersive wave with wave speed @xmath42 , which is equal to half the isothermal sound speed in the case of a vertically isothermal disc .",
    "the presence of nodal and/or apsidal precession introduces dispersion , and forbids wave propagation for frequencies between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this dispersion relation with that derived by lubow & pringle ( 1993 ) , which describes the full set of wave modes of a vertically isothermal disc .",
    "ogilvie & lubow ( 1999 ) slightly extended that work to allow for the possibility that @xmath45 , and found that , for a disc undergoing isothermal perturbations ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47",

    "\\label{lp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unlike equation ( [ dispersion ] ) , this dispersion relation is valid when the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath54 are of order unity .",
    "the two equations clearly agree well in the limit of low frequency , @xmath55 , and agree exactly when @xmath56 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the case @xmath56 is of some interest , as it relates to warped discs that are independent of time .",
    "when both nodal and apsidal precession are present , and are either both prograde or both retrograde , the dispersion relation for @xmath56 indicates that the spatial structure of the warp is oscillatory in character , its radial wavenumber being given by @xmath57 an oscillatory solution of this kind may be interpreted as a bending wave having zero phase velocity but non - zero group velocity .",
    "conversely , when the nodal and apsidal precession are in opposite senses , a steady warp is spatially evanescent .",
    "this situation is qualitatively similar to the case when the viscosity is large and the warp satisfies a diffusion equation .",
    "it applies when the orbital , epicyclic and vertical frequencies are derived from an axisymmetric newtonian gravitational potential that satisfies laplace s equation in the mid - plane of the disc , @xmath58 since this implies @xmath59 however , this need not hold in the metric of a black hole .",
    "the orbital , epicyclic and vertical frequencies around a kerr black hole satisfy ( kato 1990 ) @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the dimensionless angular momentum parameter of the hole ( @xmath64 implying a retrograde disc ) and @xmath65 is the radius in units of @xmath66 . for a prograde disc ( @xmath67 we have the ordering @xmath68 at any radius , corresponding to a situation as illustrated in fig .",

    "this suggests that these wavelike solutions are physically realizable and may be described with some confidence by theories of long - wavelength bending waves .",
    "a more accurate description of the steady wavelike shape can be obtained by setting the time - derivatives to zero in equations ( [ dwdt ] ) and ( [ dgdt ] ) .",

    "a different special case occurs when @xmath93 , since then @xmath94 exactly .",
    "while the constant @xmath95 is fixed by the tilt at large radius , @xmath96 is determined by the inner boundary condition . if this is such that the torque vanishes at the inner radius @xmath97 ( usually at the marginally stable circular orbit ) , then @xmath98 there . in the special case @xmath93 , this determines the solution as @xmath99 provided that @xmath100 .",
    "this solution can be understood as a standing wave consisting of a superposition of ingoing and outgoing bending waves ( having zero phase velocity but non - zero group velocity ) .",
    "the condition of vanishing torque at the inner radius reflects the ingoing bending waves .",
    "note that in this case the warp consists of pure tilt , without twisting ( i.e. @xmath101 ) .",
    "the steady shape of the warp can be interpreted in terms of a resonant wave - launching process ( e.g. goldreich & tremaine 1979 ) . however , in the present case , the resonance is at @xmath102 because the forcing , caused by the steady disc tilt at large radius , occurs at zero frequency .",
    "in addition , the region of maximum forcing , close to the black hole , is far removed from the resonance ( cf .",
    "lubow & ogilvie 2000 , where the resonance is at @xmath103 and the forcing is concentrated in the outer part of the disc ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the forcing effectively occurs at an intermediate radius , typically where the wave executes its outermost wavelength ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the wave is launched as a trailing ( @xmath105 ) inwardly propagating wave , having group velocity less than or of order the sound speed ( see also the discussion by nelson & papaloizou 2000 ) .",
    "we now demonstrate how these equations can be applied to the time - dependent behaviour of a disc in the neighbourhood of a rotating black hole .",
    "the simple application we have in mind here is the newtonian approximation to lense  thirring precession around a rotating black hole . in this case",
    ", we can write approximately ( demianski & ivanov 1997 ; nelson and papaloizou 2000 ; section  3 above ) @xmath106 and @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the schwarzschild radius .    in the numerical calculations we choose to solve for the quantities @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which define the radial velocity perturbation and the enthalpy perturbation according to @xmath111 where the real part is understood .",
    "these are simply related to @xmath35 and @xmath36 by @xmath112 and @xmath113 . to be explicit",
    ", we use the equations ( [ dwdt ] ) and ( [ dgdt ] ) to solve for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "steady shape of the disc is described by bessel functions of order @xmath118 , and so can be written in terms of trigonometric functions .",
    "thus we assume the disc with inner radius at @xmath97 to have @xmath119 , and thus ( in the vertically isothermal case ) a sound speed @xmath120 .",

    "no evolution was detected .",
    "we then investigated time - dependent behaviour , by considering the effect of taking a disc which is initially aligned with the spin axis of the hole , and tilting the outer parts .",
    "thus as an initial condition we take @xmath148 for @xmath149 , @xmath150)$ ] for @xmath151 , and @xmath152 for @xmath153 . to consider a reasonable physical situation we add a small amount of dissipation and take @xmath154 .",
    "we take @xmath132 initially , which satisfies the inner and outer boundary conditions and also corresponds to the correct solution for a disc with uniform tilt around a keplerian point mass .",
    "thus the initial condition corresponds to a discontinuity in the disc tilt at radius @xmath155 smoothed over a distance of @xmath156 .",
    "we integrated the equations for a time of @xmath157 using a grid with @xmath158 extending from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the initial evolution up to time @xmath161 .",
    "as expected the discontinuity in the tilt initially propagates inwards and outwards in a wavelike fashion .",
    "the outward propagation continues throughout the calculation .",
    "the inward propagation of the tilt interacts with the precessional effects at the hole and by the time @xmath162 the steady state shape of the disc close to the hole is essentially established ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "it takes the form of a steady warp , together with a slight twist ( caused by the small amount of viscosity ) as predicted by ivanov & illarionov ( 1997 ) .",
    "the interaction of the inwardly propagating warp with the inner disc regions generates a reflected wave which propagates outwards .",
    "thus towards the end of the computation ( @xmath157 ) , shown in fig .  5 , at which time the initial outwardly propagating warp wave is approaching the outer edge of the grid , followed closely by the reflection of the initially inwardly propagating warp wave , the steady warped disc solution has been established over about half the grid .",
    "we have considered the time - dependent evolution of a warped centrifugally supported disc in the low - viscosity limit ( @xmath163 ) in which warp propagation is wavelike rather than diffusive .",
    "we note that this is relevant to discs in which the viscosity is low , such as protoplanetary discs , and/or in which the disc thickness is large , such as non - radiative or high - luminosity discs around black holes .",
    "we make use of the linearized perturbation equations , which require that the tilt angle of the warp be sufficiently small .    as an illustration",
    "we apply the resulting equations to a newtonian approximation of a moderately thin ( @xmath164 ) , low viscosity ( @xmath165 ) disc around a kerr black hole with angular momentum parameter @xmath166 .",
    "the disc in this case is subject to both apsidal and nodal precession , and the evolution equations we derive are similar to those derived by demianski & ivanov ( 1997 ) in the limit of low viscosity .",
    "ivanov & illarionov ( 1997 ) demonstrated that these equations give rise to a steady state in which the disc takes up a characteristic warped shape with the precession induced by the potential being balanced by wavelike stresses in the disc .",
    "we confirm this result , and we use our time - dependent equations to demonstrate how such a steady state is set up , starting from the initial condition of a disc whose inner parts are aligned with the spin axis of the hole , and whose outer parts are tilted at a fixed inclination .",
    "we show that , once the outer tilt has propagated ( in a wavelike fashion ) to the central regions of the disc , the steady - state configuration becomes rapidly established .",
    "the adjustment of disc shape at the inner radii is propagated outwards through the disc at the usual local wave propagation speed .",
    "another possible approach to describing the steady shape of a warped disc around a black hole is based on the work of ogilvie ( 1999 ) , who developed a non - linear theory of bending waves in accretion discs .",
    "the derivation is based on certain ordering assumptions that eliminate some of the time - derivatives from the problem . in the time - dependent case ,",
    "this theory is applicable to the generic , ` non - resonant ' case and not to the special case of discs that are both nearly keplerian and nearly inviscid .",
    "however , in the case of steady warps , the theory of ogilvie ( 1999 ) is applicable to all regimes and has the advantages of being fully non - linear , and of including the effect of the accretion flow .",
    "we do not pursue this idea here , but note that for an inviscid disc with a steady warp , the theory implies that @xmath167 @xmath168,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the adiabatic exponent and @xmath169 is a dimensionless measure of the amplitude of the warp . in the linear regime",
    "these equations agree with equations ( [ dldt ] ) and ( [ dgvecdt ] ) with the time - derivatives set to zero .",
    "the theory indicates that non - linear effects become noticeable when @xmath170 is comparable to @xmath171 .",
    "this can be expected to occur in the inner part of the disc unless the tilt at large radius is sufficiently small , i.e. @xmath172 . the effect of the non - linearity is likely to be to increase the wavelength of the warp and restrict its amplitude .    other authors have cautioned against taking seriously the possibility of the disc warp having a substantial amplitude in the centre of the disc .",
    "nelson & papaloizou ( 2000 ) did not find such warps in their non - linear sph computations and attribute this failure to a presumption that `` non - linear effects lead to the damping of short wavelength [ warps ] , and thus cause the alignment of inner disc regions in which the tilt amplitude would otherwise change rapidly on small length - scales '' .",
    "although this may be the case , we note that for the case we consider , with @xmath173 , the radial length - scales of the warps are generally at least of order the local radius , @xmath9 , ( fig .  2 ) and",
    "are not small compared to the local disc scale @xmath12 .",
    "we note further that once the radial length - scale of the warp variation becomes short , the dispersive nature of the warp waves is likely to become significant and may delay the onset of non - linearity of the waves .",
    "in addition , in their original paper , ivanov & illarionov ( 1997 ) point out that although the formal computations predict a disc warp at inner radii , such predictions might be nullified if the warp itself gives rise to turbulence within the disc , and so a high local effective viscosity .",
    "they suggest that the oscillatory vertical shear within the disc caused by the warp ( papaloizou & pringle 1983 ) might become shear unstable .",
    "gammie , goodman & ogilvie ( 2000 ) have investigated this possibility , and show that instability occurs through a parametric effect and is likely to set in when @xmath174 .",
    "we have not discussed the interesting question of the net torque between the disc and the black hole , or the time - scale for mutual alignment , under conditions such that the warp propagates in a wavelike manner .",
    "the torque may be considered to be exerted in launching the steady train of inwardly propagating bending waves , which carries a certain flux of angular momentum . unlike the case of resonantly launched waves in problems of discs subject to periodic tidal forcing ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 )",
    ", the torque can not be simply expressed in terms of the properties of the disc in the neighbourhood of a certain radius .",
    "furthermore , if the viscosity is small enough that the waves reach the inner radius and reflect from it , the torque that would cause a mutual alignment is partially or completely cancelled .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath93 leading to the solution ( [ cos_solution ] ) in the absence of viscosity , the integrated horizontal torque is given in term of an integral over the disc of the relevant components of the local torque @xmath20 .",
    "writing @xmath175 , the total horizontal torque is @xmath176 rather than causing a mutual alignment , this torque causes a slow mutual precession of the disc and black hole .",
    "the direction and magnitude of the precession depend sensitively on the parameters of the disc .",
    "finally , we note that if the outer disc and the black hole are misaligned by more than @xmath177 so that the disc can be considered retrograde , the steady wavelike solution is replaced by an evanescent solution .",
    "this occurs because the nodal and apsidal precession are in opposite senses ( see equations  [ k2h2 ] , [ kerr2 ] and  [ kerr3 ] ) . in that case",
    "the steady shape of the disc may be expected to be qualitatively similar to that envisaged by bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) , with the inner disc aligned with the equator of the black hole but rotating in the opposite sense .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "the result that , in low - viscosity discs around a kerr black hole , the inner parts of the disc are not necessarily aligned with the black hole , as found by ivanov & illarionov ( 1997 ) , is a general one . indeed , depending on the disc properties , it is possible for the inner disc to be tilted at a greater angle to the hole than the outer parts of the disc .",
    "in addition , because the inner disc shape depends sensitively on the radial dependence of disc properties ( such as surface density and disc thickness ) , a change ( for example ) in the accretion rate can give rise to a change in the inner disc warp , even without changing the tilt of the outer disc .",
    "these results contrast with the usual finding ( e.g. nelson & papaloizou 2000 ) and/or assumption ( e.g. natarajan & pringle 1998 ) that the inner regions of the disc align with the equator of the hole . in the discussion above , we have noted above that confirmation of these results awaits a proper calculation using full general relativity , as well as an assessment of possible non - linear , dispersive and parametric effects .",
    "nevertheless , it is evident that the results presented here could have important implications for the directions in which jets might emanate from accreting spinning black holes",
    ". indeed , if the region responsible for direction of jet collimation is at several radii from the hole , which is likely to be the case for relativistic jets , then the newtonian approximations applied above may be adequate to confirm the effect , even if the very inner regions of the disc are indeed aligned by the fully relativistic effects close to the hole .",
    "a lack of correlation between the inner and outer disc tilts could provide one explanation of the finding by kinney et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the directions of jets from low luminosity agn appear to be uncorrelated with the disc plane of the host spiral galaxies .",
