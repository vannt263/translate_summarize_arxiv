    "in the forty years since their discovery , molecular masers have proven to be powerful signposts of star formation within our galaxy .",
    "the 6.7-ghz @xmath0 transition of methanol is the second strongest of all molecular masers ( after the 22-ghz @xmath1 transition ) and has been shown to trace high - mass star formation regions from a very early evolutionary phase until soon after the formation of an ultra - compact hii region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it also has the advantage that unlike oh and @xmath1 masers , 6.7-ghz methanol masers are only associated with high - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "to date approximately 520 6.7-ghz methanol masers have been detected @xcite , using three basic strategies ; searches targeted towards main - line oh and 12.2-ghz methanol masers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , searches targeted towards _ iras _ sources with colours characteristic of ultra - compact hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and blind searches of some regions of the galactic plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    searches towards sources selected on the basis of their _",
    "iras_-colours detected many new 6.7-ghz methanol masers , however , they also suffered from a number of shortcomings , in particular false associations and incompleteness .",
    "subsequent observations with better positional accuracy show that in some cases the masers are not associated with the _ iras _ source towards which the search was made ( false association ) . from the point of view of finding new methanol maser sites",
    "this is irrelevant , the _ iras _ point source catalogue has led to targeted observations of a high - mass star formation region containing masers . however , it does mean that it is pointless trying to infer much about the physical conditions in the masing region from _",
    "iras _ measurements .",
    "this is true even for sources where the masers are associated with the _ iras _ source because the large beamwidth of the _ iras _ observations means that the infrared flux densities measured often include contributions from multiple star formation sites within the larger molecular cloud .",
    "the second problem with _ iras_-based searches is that they fail to detect many maser sites .",
    "the untargeted search of @xcite approximately doubled the number of methanol masers in the regions searched , despite the fact that a number of searches targeted towards oh masers or _",
    "iras _ sources had already been undertaken .",
    "@xcite showed that no _ iras_-based search was able to detect more than 60% of the methanol masers in a given region due to many of the maser sites having no associated _ iras _ source .",
    "the absence of an _ iras _ source towards these methanol maser sites is likely due to well - documented problems with confusion and hyteresis in _ iras _ observations of the galactic plane and not because there is no far - infrared emission associated with the masers .    in the 20 years since",
    "the _ iras _ observations a number of other infrared satellites have made large imaging surveys of the galactic plane , in particular _ msx _ @xcite and the _ glimpse _ survey with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "the _ msx _ observations covered 4 bands from 8 - 21   with a resolution of 18  arcsec at 21  .",
    "the _ glimpse _",
    "survey was at still shorter wavelengths ( 4 bands from 3.6 through to 8.0  ) , but at much higher spatial resolution ( 1.41.9  arcsec ) .",
    "the _ msx _ observations are not sufficiently sensitive , nor of high enough angular resolution to provide useful targeting criteria for maser searches @xcite .",
    "previous ground - based mid - infrared observations have found that many methanol maser sources had no associated source at 10   @xcite and so the prospects for the _ glimpse _ survey being a useful tool for maser studies might seem poor .",
    "however , the higher sensitivity of the space - based observations means that this is not the case and @xcite ( hereafter e06 ) found that more than 90% of 6.7  ghz methanol maser sites are associated with mid - infrared emission visible in the 8.0   band .",
    "e06 showed that approximately two - thirds of methanol maser sites are associated with a _",
    "point source and that typically these sources are bright in the 8.0   band and have very red mid - infrared colours .    analysing previous untargeted searches of the galactic plane , e06 found that approximately 10% of _ glimpse _ point sources which have 8.0- intensity less than tenth magnitude ( [ 8.0 ] @xmath2 10 ) and colour between the 3.6- and 4.5- bands greater than 1.3 magnitudes ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath3 1.3 ) were associated with methanol masers .",
    "they also found that such a search of all sources meeting these _ glimpse_-based criteria within a given region would detect more than 80% of all the methanol masers in the region ( some of these would be serendipitous detections where the maser is not associated with a targeted _ glimpse _ source , but merely nearby ) .",
    "the _ glimpse _",
    "point source catalogue contains more than 30 million sources and of these 5675 meet the criteria outlined by e06 .",
    "statistically , these can not all be young high - mass star forming regions , and there must be contamination of the sample by other objects ( e06 suggested low - mass class  0 objects as one example ) .",
    "clearly it is desirable to determine if it is possible to further refine the sample to increase the percentage of targeted sources that have an associated 6.7-ghz methanol maser .",
    "many of the _ glimpse _ point sources that meet the criteria lie very close to one or another of the cut - offs and it may well be that the percentage of contaminating sources increases closer to the criterion limits . to test this hypothesis",
    "i selected the 100 most extreme sources meeting each criterion and searched for 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission towards these sources .    despite excluding _ glimpse _",
    "sources close to known 6.7-ghz methanol masers from the target sample ( see section  [ sec : obs ] ) , the redetection of some previously detected masers is inevitable in any large search .",
    "the majority of the currently known 6.7-ghz methanol masers were discovered more than a decade ago and so comparison of a current epoch spectrum with those in the literature provides an opportunity to assess the long - term variability of 6.7-ghz methanol masers .",
    "the variability of a large sample of 6.7-ghz methanol masers on timescales of a few months to a year was investigated by @xcite .",
    "they found the variability on a timescale of a year is typically less than a factor of two , but sometimes is more extreme .",
    "they also found greater variability was more prevalent in masers with weaker peak flux density .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of 54 sources regularly for more than four years and observed a range of different types of variability , including periodic variations which are not observed in water or oh masers in star formation regions .",
    "these observations showed significant variability in more than half of the spectral features analysed , suggesting the sparse sampling of @xcite underestimated the true variability .",
    "22-ghz water masers are known to exhibit much more extreme variability than is observed in 6.7-ghz methanol masers , with many individual spectral features having lifetimes of around one year @xcite .",
    "@xcite found only one of 54 6.7-ghz methanol masers ( mon  r2 ) showed significant changes in its spectral profile , similar to the variations commonly observed in water masers .",
    "@xcite estimates the lifetime of 6.7-ghz methanol maser sources to be in the range 2.54.5 @xmath4 years .",
    "individual spectral features might be expected to have significantly shorter lifetimes , and by comparing how many spectral features have disappeared and appeared over a ten year period for a sample of sources it should be possible to estimate the average lifetime of typical 6.7-ghz methanol maser spectral features / spots .",
    "to test the predictions of e06 i have carried out a search for 6.7-ghz methanol masers towards 200 _ glimpse _ point sources .",
    "to do this i started with the sample of 5675 _ glimpse _ point sources that meet both criteria [ 8.0 ] @xmath2 10 and [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath3 1.3 .",
    "the sample was drawn from the 2005 april 15 release of the _ glimpse _ point source catalogue and point sources without measurements in all three of these bands were excluded . from this sample of 5675 sources i removed those that lay within 3.5  arcmin of a methanol maser source listed in the @xcite catalogue ( 3.5",
    "arcmin is half the fwhm of the mt pleasant radio telescope at 6.7  ghz ) .",
    "this left a total of 4878 _ glimpse _ point sources and from these i extracted the 100 sources strongest in the 8.0- band and the 100 sources with the largest [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colour .",
    "the hundred sources selected on the basis of their 8.0- strength have an intensity of 4.58 magnitudes or less ( hereafter referred to as category b sources ) and the 100 reddest sources have [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colour greater than 2.87 magnitudes ( category a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : selection ] shows a colour - magnitude diagram of the selected sources , compared to all sources within a 30-arcsecond radius of @xmath5 = 326.5 , @xmath6 = 0.0 .",
    "this shows that the selected sources have very different properties to the majority of _ glimpse _ sources .",
    "the observations were made between 2005 july - december using the university of tasmania mt pleasant 26 m and ceduna 30 m radio telescopes .",
    "a rest frequency of 6.668518  ghz for the @xmath0 transition was used in the observations and data processing .",
    "a more precise determination of the rest frequency determine by @xcite measured it to be 6.6685192(8 )  ghz , and the frequency difference of 1.2  khz corresponds to a velocity change of 0.05  @xmath7 .",
    "as this is less than the accuracy to which the peak velocity can easily be determined , no correction has been made to the velocity scale to account for this . at 6.7",
    "ghz the half - power beam width of the mt pleasant and ceduna antennas are 7 and 6  arcmin respectively .",
    "the majority of the initial search observations were made at mt pleasant , as were all the final spectra ( except g345.20 - 0.04 ) .",
    "ceduna was used for some repeat observations ( where the initial observations were affected by internally generated interference ) and to determine better positions for some sources .",
    "the mt pleasant observations were made using a cryogenically cooled receiver with dual orthogonal circular polarizations each with a system temperature which varied between 750 - 1400  jy depending on the day .",
    "the data were collected using a 2-bit digital autocorrelation spectrometer configured with 4096 channels spanning a 4-mhz bandwidth . for an observing frequency of 6.7  ghz",
    "this configuration yields a natural weighting ( i.e. no hanning or other smoothing ) velocity resolution of 0.044  @xmath7 .",
    "the ceduna observations were made with an uncooled receiver with dual orthogonal circular polarizations each with a system temperature of approximately 500  jy .",
    "the ceduna correlator was identical to that used at hobart , however due to technical problems only 2048 channels were available meaning that the natural weighting velocity resolution was 0.105  @xmath7 .",
    "each _ glimpse _  source was observed for 10 minutes on - source , using an observation of a nearby target for the off - source reference .",
    "this yielded a typical rms between 0.5 and 0.6  jy after the spectrum had been smoothed with 5-point box car ( giving an effective velocity resolution of 0.22  @xmath7 ) .",
    "some class  ii methanol masers exhibit very narrow spectral features with @xcite showing the median velocity full - width half maximum of the methanol masers they observed to be 0.14  @xmath7 . to avoid missing weaker masers with very narrow features spectra",
    "were also produced for each source with only hanning smoothing applied .",
    "this yields a velocity resolution of 0.088  @xmath7 and a typical rms between 0.8 and 0.9 jy . for each of the spectra showing likely maser emission , a 5-point grid observation ( with observations made at 4 points forming a square , each offset from the fifth , central position by 3.5  arcminutes )",
    "was made to better determine the maser position .",
    "a non - linear least squares fit of a 2-dimensional gaussian with the same dimensions as the telescope beam was made to the data from the grid observations in order to better determine the location of the maser emission . in a few cases the masers",
    "were significantly offset from the targeted _ glimpse _ source and the process had to be repeated to refine the position . once an accurate position had been determined a final , sensitive observation of all the detected sources",
    "was then made .",
    "a 5-point grid observation was also made at the same time as the final spectrum and the measured positional offset used to correct the flux density scale for primary beam attenuation ( typically this correction was less than 10 per cent ) . through comparison of the measured and known positions for sources that have been previously detected the pointing accuracy of the system",
    "is estimated to be approximately 0.5  arcmin .",
    "a search of 200 _ glimpse _ sources has resulted in the detection of thirty eight 6.7-ghz methanol masers , nine of these being new discoveries ( see table  [ tab : det ] ) .",
    "methanol maser emission was detected in the spectra of 27 _ glimpse _ sources , with nine of these containing two separate sites and one three , leading to a total of 38 detections .",
    "table  [ tab : det ] lists the 6.7-ghz methanol maser sources detected , their location and the _ glimpse _ source they were detected towards .",
    "sources with no entry in the _ glimpse _ column were typically detected when making grid or final observations of the previous source in the table .",
    "table  [ tab : maserprop ] summarises the characteristics of the maser emission , including the peak flux density , velocity range and integrated flux density of the sources .",

    "the _ glimpse _ point source catalogue has been used to identify regions likely associated with high - mass star formation at the evolutionary phase when 6.7-ghz methanol masers occur .",
    "a search of the 200 most extreme sources meeting the selection criteria of e06 detected only nine new 6.7-ghz methanol masers , significantly less than expected .",
    "this implies that the most extreme sources meeting the e06 criteria are less likely than average to have an associated methanol maser , they may be associated with high - mass star formation prior to the 6.7-ghz methanol maser evolutionary phase .",
    "comparison of the spectra of the previously known 6.7-ghz methanol masers with those observed more than a decade ago ( where available ) shows that over a ten year period about 6 per cent of the spectral features will disappear and a similar number will appear .",
