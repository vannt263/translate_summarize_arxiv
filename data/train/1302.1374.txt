    "fourier and laplace transforms are useful in a wide number of applications in science and engineering .",
    "as it is well known , the fourier transform is closely related to the laplace transform for zero value funcions on the negative time axis .",
    "there is a strong interest in the efficient numerical inversion of laplace transforms ( @xcite,@xcite ) and fourier transforms , due to the fact that the solutions to some problems are known in the transform domain rather than in the original domain .",
    "an increasing number of papers have recently appeared to invert fourier transforms with wavelets , like @xcite and @xcite with coiflets wavelets and @xcite with mexican , morlet , poisson and battle - lemari wavelets . in particular in the financial engineering context",
    ", @xcite inverts a laplace transform by means of b - splines wavelets of order @xmath2 .",
    "recently , a new method called the cos method developed in @xcite for solving the inverse fourier integral is capable to accurately recover a function from its fourier transform in a short cpu time being as well of very easy implementation .",
    "however , when the function to be recovered presents discontinuities or it is highly peaked , a lot of terms in the expansion must be considered to reduce the approximation error .    in this paper",
    "we present a novel approximation based on b - splines scaling functions to numerically invert fourier transforms that it is particularly suited for functions that exhibit peaks and/or jumps in its domain .",
    "there are some properties that , at first glance , make these basis functions particularly suited to approximate such non - smooth functions .",
    "b - splines are the most regular scaling functions with the shortest support for a given polynomial degree . another important fact is the explicit formulation in the time ( or space ) domain as well as in the frequency domain .",
    "however a slight drawback of these basis functions is that the system that they form is semi - orthogonal , i.e. , the scaling functions are orthogonal among different scales but not necessarily at the same scale .",
    "in previous work @xcite the authors numerically inverted the laplace transform of a distribution function in the interval @xmath3 $ ] making use of the haar scaling functions .",
    "now , in the present paper , we consider the problem of inverting the fourier transform to recover an @xmath0 function by approximating it by a finite sum of b - splines scaling functions of order @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the particular case of the haar system ) .",
    "we also provide a list of the different errors accumulating within the numerical procedure .",
    "so , here , the fourier inversion is carried out with b - splines scaling functions rather than with wavelet functions ( @xcite ) or a combination of both ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we fix the scale parameter in the wavelet expansion and only remaining is the translation parameter , facilitating the inversion procedure .",
    "furthermore , we provide an analytical expression for the coefficients of the approximation .    as will be shown in the section devoted to numerical examples , the wavelet approximation ( wa ) that we present is well capable to detect jumps or peaks produced by discontinuities in the function itself or in first derivatives . on the contrary ,",
    "the cos method is better to approximate analytical functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1.1",
    "we give a short literature review regarding the laplace transform inversion .",
    "section 2 gives a brief introduction concerning multiresolution analysis and b - splines scaling functions . in section 3",
    "we present the wavelet approximation method to recover functions from its fourier transform by means of b - splines scaling functions .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the cos method , while numerical experiments , comparing the wavelet approximation and the cos method are shown in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 concludes .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is a real- or complex - valued function of the variable @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a real or complex parameter .",
    "we define the _ laplace transform _ of @xmath6 as , @xmath9 whenever the limit exists ( as a finite number ) .",
    "we state the inverse transform as a theorem ( see @xcite for a detailed proof ) .",
    "[ lt_inversion_teor ] ( bromwich inversion integral ) if the laplace transform of @xmath10 exists , then , @xmath11 where @xmath12 for some positive real number @xmath13 and @xmath14 is any other real number such that @xmath15 .",
    "the usual way of evaluating this integral is via the residues method taking a closed contour , often called the bromwich contour .    in this section",
    "we present some numerical algorithms to invert the laplace transform . a natural starting point for the numerical inversion of laplace transforms",
    "is the bromwich inversion integral stated in theorem [ lt_inversion_teor ] .",
    "if we choose a specific contour and perform the change of variables @xmath16 in ( [ lt_inversion_formula ] ) , we obtain an integral of a real valued function of a real variable .",
    "then , after algebraic manipulation and after applying the trapezoidal rule we obtain , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the real part of @xmath19 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the errors can be found in @xcite .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the bromwich inversion integral is not the only inversion formula and there are quite different numerical inversion algorithms .",
    "we refer the readers to the laguerre series representation given in @xcite , which is known to be an efficient method for smooth functions . however , if @xmath6 is not smooth at just one value of @xmath20 , then the laguerre method has difficulties at any value of @xmath20 .    in the context of numerical laplace inversion ,",
    "@xcite recovers the function @xmath6 with a procedure based on wavelets .",
    "they consider @xmath21 in expression ( [ lt_inversion_formula ] ) , where @xmath22 is a real variable and @xmath23 is a real constant that fulfills @xmath24 , assuming that @xmath25 when @xmath26 .",
    "then , equation ( [ lt_definition ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath27 defining , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath30 .",
    "the authors expand @xmath31 in terms of coiflets wavelets , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , being @xmath35 and @xmath36 the scaling and wavelet functions respectively .",
    "the next step consists in inverting the expression ( [ hhat_expansion ] ) by means of the fourier inversion formula .",
    "finally , considering the expression ( [ cambio_fh ] ) , the formulae of laplace inversion become , @xmath37    one drawback of this approximation is that the wavelet approach involves an infinite product of complex series and the computation of the fourier transform of some scaling functions .",
    "this can look intimidating for practical applications and may also take relatively long computational time .    based on operational matrices and haar wavelets , the author in @xcite presents a new method for performing numerical inversion of the laplace transform where only matrix multiplications and ordinary algebraic operations are involved . however , the essential step in the method consists in expressing the laplace transform in terms of @xmath38 , which is impossible when we just know numerically the transform .",
    "another drawback of this method is that the matrices become very large for larger scales .",
    "a natural and convenient way to introduce wavelets is following the notion of multiresolution analysis ( mra ) . here",
    "we provide the basic definitions and properties regarding mra and b - spline wavelets , for further information see @xcite .",
    "a countable set @xmath39 of a hilbert space is a riesz basis if every element @xmath6 of the space can be uniquely written as @xmath40 , and there exist positive constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that , @xmath43    a function @xmath44 is called a scaling function , if the subspaces @xmath45 of @xmath0 , defined by , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , satisfy the properties ,    a.   @xmath48 . b.   @xmath49 . c.   @xmath50 .",
    "d.   for each @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a riesz ( or unconditional ) basis of @xmath45 .",
    "we also say that the scaling function @xmath35 generates a multiresolution analysis @xmath53 of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath54 order cardinal @xmath42-spline function , @xmath55 , is defined recursively by a convolution : @xmath56 where , @xmath57 alternatively , @xmath58 we note that cardinal @xmath42-spline functions are compactly supported , since the support of the @xmath54 order @xmath42-spline function @xmath59 is @xmath60 $ ] , and they have as the fourier transform , @xmath61    in this paper we consider @xmath62 as the scaling function which generates a mra ( see figure [ fig - b_splines_0 ] ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath5 we have the scaling function of the haar wavelet system .",
    "we also remark that from the previous discussions , for every function @xmath63 , there exists a unique sequence @xmath64 , such that , @xmath65    c",
    "let us now consider a function @xmath66 and its fourier transform , whenever it exists : @xmath67 since @xmath66 we can expect that @xmath6 decays to zero , so it can be well approximated in a finite interval @xmath68 $ ] by , @xmath69 $ , } \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise . } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] let us approximate @xmath70 for all @xmath71 $ ] , where , @xmath72 with convergence in @xmath73-norm .",
    "note that we are not considering the left and right boundary scaling functions ( we refer the reader to section 3 in @xcite for a detailed description of scaling functions on a bounded interval ) .    the main idea behind the wavelet approximation method is to approximate @xmath74 by @xmath75 and then to compute the coefficients @xmath76 by inverting the fourier transform .",
    "proceeding this way ,    @xmath77    introducing the change of variables @xmath78 , gives us , @xmath79 finally , taking into account that @xmath80 and performing the change of variables @xmath81 , we have , @xmath82 if we consider , @xmath83 then , according to the previous formula , we have , @xmath84 since @xmath85 is a polynomial , it is ( in particular ) analytic inside a disc of the complex plane @xmath86 for @xmath87",
    ". we can obtain expressions for the coefficients @xmath76 by means of the cauchy s integral formula .",
    "this is , @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes a circle of radius @xmath90 , @xmath87 , about the origin .",

    "@xmath109 where @xmath110 .",

    "then , the roundoff error increases when @xmath90 approaches to 0 .      as mentioned before",
    ", the choice of the parameter @xmath90 may have influence in both , the discretization and the roundoff errors . in this section",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the errors listed before in order to determine the optimum @xmath90 value . to do this ,",
    "let us consider @xmath121 a step function defined in @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath122 represents the indicator function , and its fourier transform @xmath123 .",
    "due to the shape of @xmath124 it seems that the best b - splines basis to perform the approximation is based in the haar scaling functions ( b - splines of order @xmath125 ) . in this particular case @xmath126 and its derivatives",
    "up to order @xmath127 can be computed relatively straightforwardly , so that we will be able to calculate the optimal value of the parameter @xmath90 in order to minimize the discretization and the roundoff errors .",
    "we also demonstrate that the approximation error ( type ( b ) ) is @xmath125 in this case .",
    "to do so , we consider ,    @xmath128    where @xmath129 $ ] , and , @xmath130 now , we must choose an appropriate @xmath90 value to control both the discretization and the round - off errors .",

    "then , @xmath137 and , @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are polynomials in @xmath90 with degree greater than @xmath141 , and the approximations in ( [ dreq_app ] ) and ( [ ddreq_app ] ) hold for suitably small values of the parameter @xmath90 .",

    "then , the total error should be approximately minimized when the two estimates are equal .",
    "this leads to the equation , @xmath145 after algebraic manipulation , we find , @xmath146    as mentioned before , the roundoff error arises when multiplying the sum in expression ( [ coeffs_calculation1 ] ) by the pre - factor @xmath147 .",

    "we have investigated a numerical procedure , the wavelet approximation method , to invert the fourier transform of functions with finite support by means of the b - splines scaling functions .",
    "first of all , we truncate the function in a sufficiently wide interval and then we approximate it by a finite combination of b - splines wavelets up to order @xmath127 . finally the function is recovered from its fourier transform .",

    "additionally , combinations of b - splines of order one have been also considered as the functions to be recovered . with these last two examples we are able to assess the discretization and roundoff errors of the wavelet approximation method , since no errors of type ( a ) and ( b ) take place .",
    "finally , we also have considered the gaussian function .",
    "cos method performs better with infinitely differentiable functions , like the gaussian , due to the fact that the coefficients of the expansion decay exponentially fast . on the contrary , wa method is more suitable for functions that exhibit peaks or discontinuities along its domain . for the function with a jump discontinuity ,",

    "could be investigated in the future .",
    "b - splines are a semi - orthogonal system , so it would be also advisable to explore the orthogonal daubechies or battle - lemari scaling functions .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that standardized b - splines tend to the gaussian function when the order tends to infinity , so they could be very useful to recover gaussian functions from its fourier transform .",
