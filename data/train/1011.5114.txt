    "in the field of quantum information and computation , a great amount of meaningful investigations have been done to explore the dynamics of two - level systems in environments with different properties @xcite .",
    "information extracted from a bipartite system comes to the center of our interests because in this simplest scenario we can not only conveniently introduce our theoretical calculations but also obtain the same results even with different definitions . in a two - qubit system",
    ", quantum mutual information has been defined as the largest amount of information which we can extract between the qubits @xcite .",
    "this mutual information consists of two different parts , the classical correlation and the quantum correlation",
    ". quantum correlation , which is equivalent to quantum discord in some special cases @xcite , can also be divided as quantum entanglement and non - entanglement quantum correlation @xcite .",
    "many works have been focused on the different dynamics between quantum correlation and entanglement @xcite .",
    "the most popular definitions of quantum information are discussed by vedral , in which the total correlations ( quantum mutual information ) comes to the form as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath2 and @xmath3 represents the von neumann entropy which can be calculated as @xmath4 , in which @xmath5 is the eigenvalue of @xmath6 .",
    "classical correlation can be obtained from the measurements of subsystem @xmath7 under the complete set of orthonormal projectors in the form @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the excited and ground states of the qubit .",
    "then classical correlation can be expressed as @xcite @xmath12 \\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath13/q_j$ ] , @xmath14 $ ] , and @xmath15 .",
    "since the total correlations can also be expressed as @xmath16 then the quantum correlation is @xmath17    with above basic equations , the left work is to give the values of the system matrix @xmath2 . in most scenarios",
    "we may find that the classical and quantum correlation would have mediocre behaviors , such as the result that classical correlation is always lager than quantum correlation .",
    "however , many meaningful theoretical and experimental works have been done recently to demonstrate that with some special channels and a class of initial states , the classical correlation and quantum correlation will both remain constant in different regimes , and there is a sudden transition from the classical to the quantum decoherence @xcite .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate that in some common cases we can also obtain crosses of classical and quantum correlations and correlation sudden changes . by applying the hierarchy equations approach @xcite we set up the model of a two interacting qubits system in independent non - markovian environments , and we also carefully take into account the presence of system - bath coherence , which has been proved to dramatically influence the dynamics of the quantum system .",
    "as the strength of the interaction between the two qubits decreases , we can find the crosses and sudden changes gradually appear .",
    "when there are not interactions at all , the changes will be the sharpest .",
    "we present a newly developed theoretical method called hierarchy equations approach to handle the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "this method can conveniently treat the scenario in which there is a non - markovian environment .",
    "we know that both the quantum system and the heat bath have characteristic frequencies .",
    "most of theoretical treatments would suppose a fast bath to make the born and ultrafast bath approximations valid @xcite .",
    "however , in this hierarchy equations approach , a slow noise bath can be applied .",
    "this kind of environment will record part of the information from the system to the bath and then return some to the system .",
    "we set @xmath18 throughout this report .",
    "the environment is divided into two independent baths interacting with two interacting qubits .",
    "then we write the standard system hamilton as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy gap of the two - level system .",
    "the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the two qubits , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are creation and annihilation operators .",
    "@xmath25 stands for the strength of the interactions between two qubits , so we can conveniently reduce its value until zero to observe the changes of the correlations .",
    "the heat bath consists of a set of oscillators , with the form @xcite",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are coordinate , momentum , mass and frequency of the @xmath31th harmonic oscillator , respectively .",
    "then @xmath32 presents the hamilton of the bath and @xmath33 is the interaction between system and environment .",
    "@xmath34 stands for the coupling strength of the @xmath31th oscillator to the @xmath35th qubit .",
    "all of the system - bath coupling information can be found though the spectral density function @xmath36 and in this work we model it as the lorentzian cutoff @xmath37 @xmath38 represents the system - bath coupling strength , and @xmath39 is the characteristic frequency of the heat bath . when the fast bath condition is fulfilled as @xmath40",
    ", we can choose the initial state in which the system and bath are independent . if @xmath41 it represents a non - markovian environment and that is just our scenario .",
    "in the present work we choose @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and here @xmath44 stands for an energy unit . with a fourier transform of the spectral density function",
    "we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a bosonic matsubara frequency , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "the coefficients in front of the exponential function in eq.[10 ] have values as @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath49 .",
    "the equation about the dynamics of the system using hierarchy equations approach , witch has the following form @xcite    @xmath52\\nonumber\\\\ & & -i\\sum_{m=1}^2\\sum_{k=0}^kn_{mk}(c_kv_m\\rho_{n_{mk}-1}(t)-c_k^\\ast\\rho_{n_{mk}-1}(t)v_m)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -i\\sum_{m=1}^2\\sum_{k=0}^k[v_m,\\rho_{n_{mk}+1}(t ) ] , \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the liouvillian operator of the two - level system with @xmath54 $ ] , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 .    in eq.[11 ] @xmath57 are called auxiliary density operators ( ados ) @xcite .",
    "the subscript @xmath58 is a multi - index which can be extended as @xmath59 , where @xmath35 represents the number of qubits in the system and the @xmath60 represents that of the bosonic matsubara frequencies .",
    "the notation @xmath61 refers to an increase and decrease of this index . only when all the values of the multi - index are zero it stands for the physical system density operator .",
    "and if one of the notation @xmath61 has a value under zero or the sum of all the notations exceed a limit @xcite , the density operator is set to be zero .",
    "the values in the ados contain a deal of important information about the system - bath interaction , which has been proved to be able to dramatically change the dynamics of the system . with a carefully consideration of the system - bath coupling",
    "we find that it is a important factor which can greatly influence our results of the system evolution .",
    "another advantage of this theoretical treatment is the convenience of applying the method into computer programs .",
    "it is quite easy to numerically calculate the dynamics of the system density matrix though a program .",
    "this hierarchy equations approach will be a useful treatment in scenarios when the interaction between the system and the environment is very strong .",
    "in this work the environment is non - markovian and much more common than the ones in ref.@xcite .",
    "we set @xmath62 , @xmath43 and @xmath63 .",
    "the initial state of the two - qubit system is a bell state with @xmath64 .",
    "as the system hamilton only has diagonal and anti - diagonal elements , the system density matrix will evolve into @xmath65 states @xcite , which can represent a great number of quantum systems .",
    "we use numerical method to calculate the mutual information , classical correlation and quantum correlation with enough precision .    in order to show the correlation sudden changes",
    ", we set @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively in figure[1 ] .",
    "obviously , with the decrease of @xmath25 , the quantum correlation becomes sharper and sharper .",
    "when @xmath68 , a correlation sudden change occurs at certain time . for a complete view of this interesting change",
    ", we show the whole evolution of mutual information , classical correlation and quantum correlation with no interactions between the qubits in fig.[2 ] .",
    "the mutual information goes down monotonically as the system evolves .",
    "however , it is shown clearly that there are several crosses and sudden changes of the classical and quantum correlation . at",
    "first the quantum correlation shows a high speed of decay as a result of the interaction with the bath .",
    "then the decay stops and the quantum correlation even shows a little increase , which clearly demonstrate the non - markovian memory effects .",
    "however , the classical decoherence speeds up and at around @xmath69 these two correlations reach the same value . a cross",
    "immediately after the time shows the lager discord than the classical correlation during a short interval .",
    "another cross emerges at @xmath70 . after this",
    "we may not find any crosses and the quantum correlation is then always larger than classical correlation .",
    "with careful observation we know that at both crosses and some other time points ( such as @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) there are sudden changes of the correlations .",
    "these sudden changes catch interests because they may be results of some quantum phase transitions or the transition of classical and quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "we also find that the length of the intervals between these changes are all nearly @xmath73 .",
    "this phenomenon may indicate some mechanisms of the system evolution in a common non - markovian environment .    in order to investigate the sudden changes",
    ", we calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath74 after the maximization procedure in eq.[6 ] .",
    "fig.[3 ] shows the first two sudden changes of the eigenvalues .",
    "these two curves have exactly the opposite trends and both have two inflectional points , at which the derivative can become quite sharp , as we show in the inserted figure .",
    "obviously the two points correspond to the sudden changes in the classical and quantum correlations .",
    "next we concentrate on the influence of coupling strength .",
    "we choose @xmath75 and @xmath76 for comparison which are shown in fig.[4 ] .",
    "the left figure shows a quite common dynamics of the correlations , with classical correlation always larger than quantum counterpart .",
    "when the strength of the interaction between the two qubits decreases to @xmath77 , crosses begin to emerge as the quantum correlation rises and classical correlation goes down .",
    "however , with careful observation we find that the changes are not so sharp as the ones in fig.[1 ] where @xmath68 .",
    "so we can infer that at the point of @xmath68 some interesting phenomenon may happen such as the correlation sudden changes .",
    "apart from the effects of the interactions between the two qubits , the initial states of the system also play an important role on the evolution of the correlations , as shown in fig.[5 ] .",
    "we change the initial state from odd ( @xmath64 ) to even parity ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be the same as those in fig.[2 ] .",
    "sudden transitions between quantum and classical correlations can be found which has been demonstrated in other systems @xcite .",
    "this kind of transition can occur several times in our system during the evolution such as at the time @xmath79 , @xmath80 and so on .",
    "we study the evolution of the classical and quantum correlations of a two - qubit system in independent non - markovian environments , applying the newly developed hierarchy equations approach .",
    "the influence of initial state and coupling strength between the qubits are investigated .",
    "crosses and sudden changes of classical and quantum correlations are illustrated .",
    "we further show sudden transition between classical and quantum correlations for certain initial state .",
