    "the baryon density in the core of a compact star is likely to reach several times the nuclear saturation density , @xmath2 or @xmath3 . at such a high density",
    ", nucleons in nuclear matter are crushed into their constituents , i.e. quarks and gluons .",
    "itoh proposed a model for quark stars in 1970 @xcite .",
    "the deconfinement transition to quark matter was suggested by collins and perry in 1975 @xcite based on the asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics . in the same paper they also mentioned the possibility that quark matter could be a superfluid or a superconductor resulting from the attractive interquark force in some channels .",
    "barrois , bailin and love developed this novel idea and studied the unusual variant of superconductivity in quark matter , which we now call color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "they did their calculations in the framework of weak coupling approach and did not take into account the dynamic screening of magnetic gluons which are dominant agents in pairing quarks .",
    "therefore the gap or equivalently the transition temperature they obtained are too small to be of relevance to any sizable observables .",
    "about fifteen years later the color superconductivity had been re - discovered by several groups who found the gap could be large enough to bring some real effects in compact stars @xcite .",
    "[ for recent reviews on color superconductivity , see , for example , @xcite . ]    at asymptotically high baryon density or chemical potential , the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase is favored @xcite .",

    "the situation is more complicated at lower densities realized in compact stars . in this case , the strange quark mass @xmath4 is in the range from its current mass @xmath5100 mev to its constituent mass @xmath5500 mev .",
    "the main effect of @xmath4 is to cause a mismatch in chemical potentials between strange quarks and light quarks . the cfl phase is therefore broken down to less symmetric phases .",
    "moreover the @xmath6 equilibrium and electric and color charge neutrality also give rise to a mismatch between the fermi momenta of the quarks that form cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "if the mismatch in chemical potentials for pairing quarks is large enough , the conventional bcs pairing becomes questionable @xcite and the true ground state of quark matter in compact stars has to include different , unconventional superconducting states @xcite .",
    "single - flavor cooper pairing is the simplest option for neutral quark matter .",
    "contrary to other unconventional pairing mechanisms , it is allowed for arbitrarily large mismatches between the fermi momenta of different quark flavors .",
    "single - flavor pairing in the color anti - triplet channel is possible only in the symmetric spin - one channel @xcite , because pauli principle requires that the wave function of the cooper pair be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the pairing quarks .",
    "this is in contrast to pairing of different flavors where the antisymmetric spin - zero channel is allowed .",
    "similar to superfluid helium-3 , where condensation occurs in spin and angular momentum triplets @xcite , the order parameter in a spin - one color superconductor is a complex @xmath7 matrix .",
    "therefore various possible phases emerge corresponding to different patterns of the matrix order parameter . among others ,",
    "there are four main spin - one color - superconducting phases : the color - spin locked ( csl ) , planar , polar , and @xmath8 phases @xcite . except for the csl phase",
    ", the gap functions of spin - one phases are normally anisotropic in momentum space .",
    "the gap in the polar phase vanishes at the south and north poles of the fermi sphere , whereas the gap in the planar phase is anisotropic but nonzero in any direction of the quasi - particle momentum .",
    "the @xmath8 phase is special in the sense that it has two gapped quasi - particle modes with different angular structures , one of which has two point nodes .",
    "spin - one color superconducting phases play important roles in thermal properties in quark matter .",
    "spin - one phases have gaps of a few tens of kevs , which can fit into the cooling data of compact stars @xcite .",
    "the anisotropies especially the nodes in some spin - one phases significantly affect various thermodynamical and transport properties like the specific heat , the neutrino emissivity , the viscosity , the heat and electrical conductivity , etc .. in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have computed the neutrino emissivity from direct urca ( du ) processes and the specific heat for the mentioned spin - one phases to obtain the resulting cooling rates for compact stars .",
    "we have discussed the reason why the distribution of neutrino emission from the @xmath8 phase breaks reflection symmetry in space @xcite .",
    "similar calculations of neutrino emissivity in du processes in the 2sc phase can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we know that du processes in normal and color superconducting quark matter is controlled by the phase space opened up through fermi liquid properties @xcite , which arises from the quark - quark forward scattering amplitude .",
    "up to now the amplitude has been derived only via one gluon exchange @xcite , which is a standard weak coupling perturbative approach with zero quark mass . in this paper",
    "we derive the quark - quark scattering amplitude via one gluon exchange but with massive quarks .",
    "we also do the same in the njl model .",
    "the forward scattering amplitude gives a general formula @xmath9 for the relation between the fermi momentum @xmath10 and the chemical potential @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the fermi momentum reduction coefficient with respect to @xmath11 and depends on coupling constants .",
    "the phase space for du processes with massive quarks both in qcd and in the njl model is then openned up resulting from the fermi momentum reduction .",
    "we find an interesting behavior of @xmath12 as a function of @xmath11 in the weak coupling regime that @xmath12 increases with increasing @xmath11 and approaches its limit value as @xmath13 .",
    "it means that the phase space for neutrino emissions is larger at high baryon densities than at low ones .",
    "the property seems robust and independent of specific models in computing quark - quark scattering amplitudes and landau coefficients .    in this paper",
    "we also extend our established formalism @xcite by including quark masses to calculate neutrino emissivities in a spin - one color superconductor .",
    "the quark masses bring much complexity to quasi - particle dispersion relations in spin - one phases , as was shown in ref .",
    "we use the effective quark mass on the fermi surface in the calculation , which is determined by the quark - quark interaction in the fermi liquid . by assuming a natural form of the order parameters for spin - one phases , we show that the quasi - particle dispersion relations bear the same form as in the massless case , which much facilitates the calculation . in the collinear and small mass limit",
    ", we derive neutrino emissivities with massive quarks and identify mass corrections .",
    "the mass corrections are of the same order as in the massless case .",
    "we find no mass correction in the polar phase .",
    "the mass correction for the a phase approaches zero at asymptotically low temperatures because all contributions are from gapped modes .",
    "the mass corrections in the csl and planar phases are found to be about 26% and 15% of the contributions in the massless case at low temperatures respectively .",
    "this will have sizable effects on the cooling of compact stars .",
    "these percentages for the mass corrections are universal as long as @xmath14 , which is fullfilled in qcd weak coupling approach and for realistic values of coupling constants in the njl model .",
    "note that mass corrections could be very different near the chiral phase transition or for strange quarks with even larger quark masses .",
    "however our current formulation is only valid at small mass limit with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "for very large quark masses , the landau fermi liquid theory has to be reformulated and the integral in the emissivity is very different from the small mass limit .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current work . a future investigation of effects with large quark masses",
    "is needed .",

    "we study du processes for light quarks @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes electrons and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos respectively .",
    "the phase space is essential for these processes to proceed . in normal quark",
    "matter , if quarks are treated as free and massless , @xmath6 equilibrium requires @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are chemical potentials for @xmath28 , @xmath29 quarks and electrons respectively .",
    "this leads to the relation in fermi momenta @xmath30 .",
    "one sees that the phase space is zero because there is no triangle inequality among fermi momenta .",
    "if the quark - quark interaction is switched on , fermi momenta are not the same as chemical potentials any more , instead they get negative corrections from landau fermi liquid property @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath33 is the eigenvalue of the casimir operator of @xmath34 group in the fundamental representation with the number of colors @xmath35 .",
