    "grating spectrometers on board chandra and xmm - newton have revolutionized the field of x - ray spectroscopy of cosmic plasmas .",
    "individual lines can be measured in the soft x - ray energy range with sufficient accuracy to permit measurements of elemental abundances , plasma densities , or simply to reveal the spectroscopic nature of a cosmic plasma ( e.g. , see paerels & kahn 2003 for a review on high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy with chandra and xmm - newton ) .",
    "many cool stars are bright x - ray sources thanks to their hot coronae and their close distances .",
    "they are ideal targets for x - ray spectroscopy since they display a wealth of bright emission lines of various elements .",
    "recent reviews summarize results obtained in the first years after the launch of chandra and xmm - newton ( e.g. , audard 2003 , gdel 2003 , linsky 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , patterns in coronal abundances have been recognized in which elements with a first ionization potential ( fip ) @xmath0  ev are underabundant with respect to the high - fip elements when observed in very active stars ; this is opposite to the solar fip effect in which low - fip elements are overabundant whereas high - fip elements are of photospheric composition .",
    "however , coronal abundances in a sample of stars with a broad range of magnetic activity seem to reverse from a solar - like fip effect in the least active , old stars to an `` inverse''-fip effect in the most active , young stars ( gdel et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the trend is suggestive and a larger sample is certainly needed .",
    "two very active stars , yy men and v824 ara , have been observed with grating spectrometers on board chandra and xmm - newton in order to study , in particular , their coronal abundances .",
    "yy men is one of the ( rare ) class of single giants with very hot coronae , whereas v824 ara is an example of a close main - sequence , very active rs cvn binary .",
    "we present here preliminary results of the grating observations .",
    "chandra observed yy men in the acis - s / hetg configuration for 74  ks in february 12 , 2002 , whereas the 86  ks - long xmm - newton observation dates from october 56 , 2001 .",
    "the rs cvn binary v824 ara was observed with chandra acis - s / hetgs for 94  ks on july 1011 , 2002 .",
    "the chandra data sets were reduced with ciao 2.3 with caldb 2.21 using standard techniques described in threads ; however , events for v824 ara and lds 587b were resolved using narrower , non - standard grating arms ( 10 times the 1@xmath1 cross - dispersion width instead of the default 35 times ) .",
    "thanks to the low background in acis , no background spectra were used in the chandra spectral analysis allowing us to use the robust c statistics .",
    "the xmm - newton grating data were reduced with sas 5.4.1 using standard techniques ( see audard et al .",
    "the chandra and xmm - newton observations were motivated by the very hot temperature detected with rosat pspc and asca ( gdel et al .",
    "1996 ) and its extreme luminosity ( @xmath2 for a distance of 291  pc ) . yy men ( @xmath3  d ; @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 ; e.g. , collier cameron 1982 ) is a member of a loosely - defined class of rapidly rotating single g and k giant stars ( `` fk com stars '' ) , whose outstanding property is a projected equatorial velocity measured up to 160  km  s@xmath5 , in contrast with the expected maximum of 6  km  s@xmath5 for giants .",
    "one of the leading theories to explain the extreme properties of fk com stars suggests that they were formed by coalescence of a contact binary when one of the components entered into the giant stage ( bopp & stencel 1981 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the chandra acis - s / hetg first - order heg and meg spectra .",
    "several emission lines are detected ; in particular fe lines in various ionization states can be found , from fe  xvii to fe  xxv , indicating a broad distribution of plasma temperatures , typically from @xmath6  mk to @xmath7  mk .",
    "elements such as n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and ca are detected as well , mostly in h - like and he - like transitions .",
    "the strong ly@xmath8 lines indicated a dominant very hot plasma , also suggested by the fe k@xmath8 complex and the strong underlying continuum .",
    "we used a multi-@xmath9 approach and fitted the meg and heg data simultaneously to obtain a discretized emission measure ( em ) distribution of yy men along with coronal abundances .",
    "we also approached the data differently and extracted line fluxes to construct a continuous em distribution and obtain coronal abundances as well .",
    "we describe our methodology elsewhere ( audard et al .",
    "we report here , in brief , on the 3-@xmath9 approach : a very hot ( 40  mk ) plasma dominates the x - ray spectrum ; however two other plasma components are detected as well ( 7  mk and 14  mk ) .",
    "no lower @xmath9 component could be detected either in the chandra hetgs data or in the rgs spectrum .",
    "the em ratios are 1:2:19 ( where the coolest component has em=1 ) , the x - ray luminosity is @xmath10  erg  s@xmath5 ( 0.110  kev ) with @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "coronal abundances indicate a pattern reminiscent of the inverse fip effect observed in active rs cvn binaries ( e.g. , audard et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , a high n abundance ( @xmath13 = + 0.3}$ ] ) probably reflects a high photospheric n abundance due to cn processing in the stellar interior ; indeed the rgs spectrum does not show a c  vi ly@xmath8 line , indicating a low @xmath14=-0.8}$ ] ratio .    line broadening is detected in the ne  x ly@xmath8 line ( @xmath15  m ; figure  2 ) .",
    "similar _ tentative _ detections are reported in ne  x ly@xmath16 , o  viii ly@xmath8 , mg  xii ly@xmath8 , and si  xiv ly@xmath8 .",
    "however , s , ar , and ca ly@xmath8 lines are either too weak or at too short wavelength to detect line broadening .",
    "n  vii ly@xmath8 , however , does _ not _ show evidence of broadening .",
    "th ne  x line broadening is unlikely to be due to rotation since ( i ) it would require @xmath17  km  s@xmath5 , and ( ii ) it would be easily detected in the longer wavelength lines .",
    "thus we interpret the observed broadening as doppler thermal broadening in the very hot corona of yy men . the n  vii line , despite the lower atomic mass of n than of ne ,",
    "is probably not broadened because it is mostly formed by the lower @xmath9 components , while the ne lines are mostly formed by the very hot plasma ( as are the lines with tentative detections of line broadening ) .",
    "this is also supported by the absence of line broadening in fe lines , probably due to the larger fe atomic mass .",
    "the observed doppler width ( @xmath18 ) corresponds to a plasma @xmath9 in the range 6090  mk .",
    "possibly additional broadenings , e.g. , due to rotation , contribute to the total line width , which would lower the @xmath9 range .",
    "the nearby ( 31  pc ) binary consists of g5  v+k0  v stars tidally locked with an orbital period of 1.68  d. based on its kinematics and its high li abundance , v824 ara is either in the pre - main - sequence phase ( pasquini et al .  1991 ) or in the zero - age - main - sequence phase ( martn & brandner 1995 ) , with an age of @xmath19  yr . its common proper - motion dm4.5e companion ( 33@xmath20 away ) , lds 587b , also displays high chromospheric and coronal activity .",
    "since v824 ara is so young , its photosphere should have near - solar photospheric composition .",
    "figure  3 shows the chandra acis - s / hetg meg spectrum of v824 ara together with a best - fit 4-@xmath9 plasma model .",
    "the em distribution differs from yy men ; it is flatter with @xmath9 of 3.7 , 7.7 , 14 , and 28  mk , em ratios of 1:3:2:2.7 , and @xmath21  erg  s@xmath5 ( 0.110  kev ) .",
    "the coronal abundances show a distinct inverse fip effect ( @xmath22 = -0.5}$ ] , @xmath23 = -0.3}$ ] , @xmath24 = -0.1}$ ] ) , except at very low fip ( @xmath25  ev ) , where the al and ca abundances seem to increase .",
    "a similar pattern was observed in the coronal abundances of the rs cvn binary @xmath26 crb ( osten et al .",
    "the lds 587b companion was sufficiently bright ( @xmath27  erg  s@xmath5 ) and spatially resolved to produce a distinct grating spectrum that reveals a similar @xmath9 structure ( although em ratios for a 3-@xmath9 fit are 1:1.1:1.6 ) .",
    "preliminary coronal abundances indicate no obvious correlation with the fip .",
    "+   +   +    plasma densities can be derived from line ratios , typically from the forbidden and intercombination lines of he - like transitions .",
    "the well - developed hetgs spectrum of v824 ara reveals no variation from the low density limit in the various he - like triplets , suggesting that the dominant x - ray emitting plasma has an electron density below @xmath28  @xmath29 . since coronae",
    "are inhomogeneous , this result does not mean that no high - density plasma exists .",
    "however , it suggests that such plasma has a very low volume ( since @xmath30 ) .",
    "we have presented results of observations of yy men and v824 ara with chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "the highly active stars show contrasting x - ray spectra : the em distribution of yy men is dominated by a very hot ( 40  mk ) plasma but has measurable em between 6 and 15  mk , whereas the binary v824 ara displays a rather flat em distribution from 3  mk to 30  mk . despite their differences , their coronal abundances ( relative to the solar photospheric composition )",
    "generally follow the inverse fip effect observed in other active binaries . however , coronal abundances in the m dwarf lds 587b do not correlate with the fip .",
    "the coronal n abundance in yy men is enhanced ( c is depleted ) , probably reflecting a true photospheric n / c enhancement due to mixing of cn - cycle material in the stellar interior .",
    "yy men also shows line broadening in ne  x ly@xmath8 and possibly in other lines , which we interpret as doppler broadening .",
    "the general picture is that coronal abundances in very active stars display an inverse fip effect , while inactive stars show a solar - like fip effect ( e.g. , gdel et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , most current studies are limited to comparing _",
    "stellar _ coronal abundances to _ solar _ photospheric abundances because of the lack of accurate photospheric measurements in active stars .",
    "thus caution is in effect , since coronal abundances could also be affected by anomalous photospheric compositions as shown here for yy men , apart from selective , fip - dependent coronal enrichment .",
    "improvements in the photospheric composition in stars will help better understand the coronal composition .",
