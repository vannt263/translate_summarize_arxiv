    "although the higgs - like boson has been discovered , we have not yet revealed the structure of the higgs potential . in building models of the higgs sector ,",
    "we adopt electroweak baryogenesis scenario as a guiding principle .",
    "it is known that successful electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite relies on sufficient amount of cp violation and strongly first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , both of which are not realized in the standard model ( sm ) with 126 gev higgs boson mass . the latter condition on ewpt",
    "is directly connected to the structure of the higgs potential and may give a clue to the study on the higgs sector .",
    "we therefore discuss extensions of the sm higgs sector that enable strongly first order ewpt . in general , models that realize strongly first order ewpt through enhanced thermal cubic term",
    "necessarily contain large coupling constants in the higgs sector , which blow up at a landau pole below the planck scale .",
    "extended higgs models with large coupling constants in the higgs sector have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the models must be replaced by more fundamental theories above the landau pole .",
    "we propose an ultraviolet ( uv ) complete model of an extended higgs sector that incorporates such large coupling constants @xcite .",
    "our model is based on supersymmetric ( susy ) su(2 ) gauge theory with six doublets , similar to the minimal fat higgs model @xcite .",
    "this gauge theory becomes strongly - coupled at an infrared ( ir ) scale , which we call ` confinement scale ' , and below that scale , the theory is described in terms of mesonic superfields with an emergent effective superpotential which contains large coupling constants .",
    "we identify the mesonic superfields with the higgs superfields of the susy sm as well as extra iso - spin doublet and singlet chiral superfields in an extended higgs sector , and indentify the effective superpotential with that of the extended higgs sector . in this way , we introduce , with a solid uv completion , extra superfields that couple with the higgs superfields through large coupling constants .",
    "a feature of the model is that the scale at which the large coupling constants blow up is identified with the confinement scale of the susy gauge theory .",
    "we investigate the phenomenology of the susy extended higgs sector that has been obtained as the low - energy effective theory of the susy su(2 ) gauge theory . with a benchmark mass spectrum ,",
    "we calculate the strength of ewpt and look for parameter regions where strongly first order ewpt occurs .",
    "we further calculate the triple coupling constant of the sm - like higgs boson and the decay branching ratio into di - photon , whose deviations from the sm values give collider signatures of the model . +",
    "we consider a susy extended higgs sector that emerges as a low - energy effective theory of a new susy su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory with six doublet chiral superfields , which are also charged under sm gauge groups su(2)@xmath1 u(1)@xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath3 parity is assigned to the doublets to forbid large flavor changing neutral currents in the resultant extended higgs sector .",
    "one can say that the susy su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory is the uv picture of the model .",
    "the field content of the susy su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory is summarized in table 1 .    .",
    "sm charge and @xmath3 parity assignments on the @xmath4 doublets , @xmath5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the scalar components of the superfields @xmath6 gain vacuum expectation values , which give effective @xmath7-terms for the other superfields .",
    "the physical components of @xmath8 do not contribute to the one - loop effective potential for the susy sm higgs scalars , and hence can be neglected in phenomenological studies .",
    "the superpotential of the phenomenologically relevant part of the higgs sector is then given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the physical component of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes a running coupling constant for the superfields in the extended higgs sector .",
    "na@xmath13ve dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite suggests that the coupling constant @xmath12 becomes non - perturbative at a similar scale where the susy su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory in the uv picture becomes strongly - coupled , _",
    "i.e. _ , the confinement scale @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , with a given renormalization group equation of @xmath12 , the value of @xmath12 at the electroweak scale is in one - to - one correspondence with the confinement scale @xmath14 .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms are introduced as follows : @xmath15 similar to the minimal susy sm , electroweak symmetry breaking occurs with the help of soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the yukawa couplings , including the top quark yukawa coupling , are introduced in the same way as in the minimal fat higgs model @xcite .",
    "using finite - temperature effective potential and the methods introduced in @xcite , we make a numerical analysis on the order of ewpt , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively denote the critical temperature and the value of the order parameter at that temperature .",
    "the benchmark mass spectrum is as follows . for the susy sm sector , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively denote the soft susy breaking masses for the susy tops and bottoms . for the @xmath3-odd sector , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the square root of the sum of the @xmath7-term squared and the soft susy breaking mass squared for the field @xmath24 .",

    ", the condition of quick sphaleron decoupling for ewbg , @xmath31 , determines the scale of the landau pole to be below about 15 tev , which corresponds to the confinement scale of the su(2)@xmath0 gauge theory .",
