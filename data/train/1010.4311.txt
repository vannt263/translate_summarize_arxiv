    "radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are rotating neutron stars ( ns ) that have been spun up via the transfer of angular momentum through accretion in low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , a total of 9 @xmath1-ray emitting msps have been identified through their @xmath1-ray pulsations  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models have long suggested that an accretion - powered msp in a lmxb will turn on as a rotation - powered msp when the system is in quiescence  @xcite .",
    "how exactly the transition happens is not completely understood , however , it is widely believed that radio msps can only turn on after the accretion disk is removed .",
    "suggested mechanisms include the pulsar wind ablation  @xcite , heating associated with the deposition of @xmath1-rays from the msp  @xcite , and the propeller effect  @xcite .",
    "psr  j1023@xmath00038 is the first and only known rotation - powered msp in a quiescent lmxb , namely first  j102347.67@xmath0003841.2  ( hereafter j1023 ) .",
    "j1023 was identified as a lmxb in 2006  @xcite and the radio msp was found subsequently  @xcite .",
    "the source clearly showed an accretion disk before 2002  @xcite and the disk has since disappeared  @xcite ; radio pulsation was found in 2007  @xcite .",
    "therefore psr  j1023@xmath00038   is considered as a newly born msp , representing the long sought - after missing link of a rotation - powered msp descended from a lmxb .",
    "the spin down power of psr  j1023@xmath00038  ( @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is relatively high compared to other @xmath1-ray msps  @xcite .",
    "a small fraction of this power would suffice to generate detectable @xmath1-rays from psr  j1023@xmath00038 .",
    "given the recent evidence of an accretion disk before 2002 that later disappeared , it is of great importance to probe the energy source that facilitated the dissolution of the disk .",
    "the detection of x - rays from the system  @xcite provides a hint that high - energy processes are ongoing , which is further strengthened by the reported x - ray pulsation from psr  j1023@xmath00038  and orbital variability in x - rays  @xcite .",
    "these results prompted us to search for @xmath1-rays from the system and to study its x - ray properties in more detail .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope is able to detect @xmath1-rays with energies between @xmath620  mev and @xmath7300  gev  @xcite .",
    "data used in this work were obtained between 2008 august 4 and 2010 july 14 that are available at the fermi science support center .",
    "we used the fermi science tools v9r15p2 package to reduce and analyze the data in the vicinity of j1023 . only those data that passed the most stringent photon selection criteria ( i.e. the `` diffuse '' class ) were used . to reduce the contamination from earth albedo @xmath1-rays , we excluded events with zenith angles greater than 105@xmath8 .",
    "the instrument response functions `` p6_v3_diffuse '' recommended for analysis of the `` diffuse '' class events were used .",
    "we chose 200  mev as the lower energy cut to include sufficient source photons at low energies while reducing the contamination of background photons that dominates at low energies .",
    "therefore , we used events with energies between 200  mev and 20  gev in the likelihood analysis .",
    "we carried out an unbinned maximum - likelihood spectral analysis ( _ gtlike _ ) of the circular region of 15@xmath8 radius centered on the @xmath1-ray position ( see below ) .",
    "we subtracted the background contribution by including the galactic diffuse model ( gll_iem_v02.fit ) and the isotropic background ( isotropic_iem_v02.txt ) , as well as all sources in the first fermi / lat catalog  ( 1fgl ; * ? ? ?",

    "why this @xmath1-ray source was not present in the 1fgl catalog , we divided the whole dataset into two : the first and second year data , respectively , and performed the likelihood analysis for each of them separately .",
    "both ts values drop to 2224 , which are about half of the ts value derived using the whole dataset and below the threshold of ts@xmath1025 to be included in the 1fgl catalog  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the source we found is significant ( i.e. , @xmath75@xmath9 ) with two - year data .",
    "the spectral parameters from each dataset are also consistent with the values reported below .",
    "we then fit the @xmath1-ray spectrum with a single pl , resulting in a photon index of @xmath14 and an integrated energy flux above 200  mev of @xmath15  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath5 .",
    "we divided the 200  mev20  gev @xmath1-rays into five energy bins of logarithmically equal bandwidths and reconstructed the flux using _ gtlike _ for each band separately , assuming a pl model with @xmath172.9 within each bin .",
    "no @xmath1-ray source was needed at the j1023 position in the three bins above 1.3  gev ( derived ts values @xmath185 ) in the likelihood analysis , indicating a cut - off at @xmath61  gev .",
    "we therefore attempted to fit the 200  mev20  gev spectrum with a pl with an exponential cut - off ( ple ) .",
    "we found that ple also well describes the spectrum , i.e. both pl and ple models gave the same ts value of 50 .",
    "however , it should be noted that a spectral cutoff is statistically not required . due to the low photon statistics",
    "( @xmath6280 modeled photons from j1023 ) , the spectral parameters of the ple model can not be well constrained simultaneously .",
    "motivated by the possible magnetospheric origin of the @xmath1-rays , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are estimated by fixing the other one ( at its mean value ) to be 1.9@xmath20.3 and 700@xmath2220  mev .",
    "we fixed @xmath19 at 1.5 to 2.4 ( with steps of 0.1 ) while letting the normalization and @xmath20 free , and found that @xmath20 was only well constrained when @xmath17  1.7 to 2.1 , consistent with the above result .",
    "at the distance of 1.3  kpc , the @xmath1-ray luminosity ( above 200 mev ) is @xmath21  erg  s@xmath5 . assuming that the @xmath1-rays come from psr  j1023@xmath00038  ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] ) , the pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath22  ergs  s@xmath5  @xcite implies a @xmath1-ray conversion efficiency of only @xmath230.3% .",
    "such @xmath1-ray luminosity and @xmath1-ray efficiency are among the smallest of @xmath1-ray msps .",
    "moreover , assuming the ple model is robust , the cutoff energy of @xmath6700  mev is the lowest among all @xmath1-ray msps .",
    "the spectral properties of the @xmath1-ray emission from j1023 are summarized in table  [ gamma_spec_par ] .",
    "a search for pulsation of the @xmath710  mev @xmath1-rays within a 1@xmath24  radius region around the @xmath1-ray position was performed .",
    "we did not find any significant pulsed detection at or close to the spin - period of the pulsar nor any indication of @xmath1-ray variability related to the orbital modulation .",
    "even so , given the low photon statistics ( of just over 700 photons ) , this result does not preclude any @xmath1-ray pulsation .",
    "we also performed a long - term temporal analysis of j1023 , in which the 2-year data were binned in 3-month periods .",
    "no significant @xmath1-ray variability was found , indicating that the object is stable ( down to 3-month periods ) in radiating @xmath1-rays .",
    "the @xmath1-rays from j1023 originate either from the pulsar magnetosphere or a shock where material overflowing from the companion interacts with the pulsar wind . in the pulsar wind scenario ,",
    "@xmath1-rays may be generated as synchrotron radiation of the electrons and positrons accelerated in the shock  @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical uncertainty is how a particle kinetic - dominated flow can be formed near the pulsar  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is also difficult to explain the steep pl spectrum ( @xmath253 ) in the synchrotron model . on the other hand ,",
    "if the pulsar magnetosphere is sufficiently clear of matter , gev @xmath1-ray photons can be produced in a slot - gap  @xcite or an outer - gap accelerator  @xcite .",
    "the curvature radiation from a gap accelerator is expected to have a ple shape .",
    "the reported x - ray pulses from psr  j1023@xmath00038  @xcite suggests that the observed @xmath1-rays are also produced in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "more accumulated source photons in the future should help to answer whether there exists @xmath1-ray pulsation or variability on the time scale of the orbital period , in turn helping to distinguish these two scenarios for the observed @xmath1-rays .    applying the outer gap model ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray luminosity is approximately described by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fractional gap thickness , i.e. the ratio of the gap thickness to the radius of the light cylinder and @xmath28 the pulsar spin down power with @xmath29 corresponding to the surface magnetic field , @xmath30 the stellar radius , and @xmath31 the rotation period .",
    "the fractional gap thickness is determined by the pair - creation condition between @xmath1-rays emitted in the outer gap and x - rays from the ns surface , i.e. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33  gev and @xmath34 are the typical energy of the @xmath1-rays and the x - rays , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath35  ev ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : xray ] and table  [ x_spec_par ] ) , and following  @xcite we find f @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray luminosity is estimated as @xmath37erg  s@xmath5 using @xmath38 , consistent with the required luminosity from an irradiating source to explain the heating of the companion star  @xcite .",

    "we note , however , that the @xmath1-ray flux depends on the viewing geometry , because the intensity varies over the @xmath1-ray beam .",

    "xmm - newton observations of j1023 were conveyed on 12 may 2004 ( hereafter we refer this observation as xmm1 ) with all the epic cameras operated in full - frame mode , and on 26 november 2008 ( hereafter xmm2 ) with the mos  1/2 ccds operated in full - frame mode and the pn camera operated in timing mode with a resolution of 0.03  ms .",
    "archibald et al . ( 2010 ) reported an x - ray analysis of j1023 , finding a possible x - ray pulsation from psr  j1023@xmath00038  and modulation on the orbital period of the binary .",
    "they interpreted the latter as coming from an intrabinary shock , and suggested a composite spectral model with a pl plus a possible thermal component .",
    "although this model results in an acceptable goodness - of - fit , we found that their analysis is apparently incomplete .",
    "the x - ray spectrum from the pulsar magnetosphere is typically different from the shock emission ( cf . hui & becker 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) , and the combined contribution from the two emission regions can not be generally described by a single pl . to complement their results ,",
    "we report our independent analysis of these xmm - newton observations .",
    "as pn data obtained from xmm2 are collapsed into a one - dimensional row , they are not suitable for spectroscopy . after filtering for the high sky background and events affected by bad pixels , the effective exposures are 14.9  ( mos  1/2 ) and 11.6  kiloseconds ( pn ) for xmm1 , and 33.5  kiloseconds ( mos1/2 ) for xmm2 .",
    "to avoid contamination from a nearby x - ray source , we extracted the energy spectrum of j1023 from the circles with radius 25    centered on the radio timing position in all datasets , which corresponds to an encircled energy fraction @xmath49 .",
    "the background spectra were sampled from nearby low - count circular regions of radius 40  in the corresponding cameras .",
    "we grouped each spectrum dynamically to obtain the same signal - to - noise ratio in each dataset .",
    "first , we fit the xmm1 and xmm2 data separately with various single - component models .",
    "only the pl model provides a good description of the data in both xmm1 and xmm2 ( see table  [ x_spec_par ] ) . with no indication of spectral and flux variability between data taken in xmm1 and xmm2 , we combined both datasets for a constraining spectral analysis .",
    "we found that the single pl model provides an acceptable description of the combined data with the spectral parameters as in archibald et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . however , we found systematic deviations in this model , indicating that additional component(s ) might be required . motivated by the possible presence of both pulsed emission and emission dependent on the orbital phase of the binary , we fit the spectrum with a broken power law ( bkpl ) .",
    "the goodness - of - fit was found to be improved significantly ( @xmath50 for 75 d.o.f . ) and no systematic fitting residuals were found ( see fig .  [ xray_spec ] ) , in contrast with the best - fit model ( i.e. single pl model ) presented in fig . 1 of  @xcite .",
    "to statistically address the improvement for the spectral fits from the single pl to the broken pl , we used an f - test and found that the p - value is 7.7@xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the additional parameters are required statistically .",
    "this behavior was found in both epochs ( xmm1 as well as xmm2 ) .",
    "the break energy was found to be @xmath52  kev .",
    "the spectrum was found to be steeper ( i.e. @xmath53 ) at @xmath54 than that in the hard band ( i.e. @xmath55 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed flux was found to be @xmath56  ergs  @xmath16  s@xmath5 ( 0.0110  kev ) . at a distance of @xmath57",
    "kpc , the isotropic x - ray luminosity is @xmath58  ergs  s@xmath5 ( 0.0110  kev ) , corresponding to an x - ray conversion efficiency of @xmath59 of the spin - down luminosity .",
    "as thermal x - rays from the ns surface may also contribute , we estimated the thermal contribution besides the nmha model with the mass and radius of the ns fixed at @xmath60 and @xmath61  km . nevertheless , this additional thermal model was only required at a confidence level of @xmath62 . furthermore , with normalization as a free parameter , an unreasonably small source distance of @xmath63  pc was inferred .",
    "to constrain the possible thermal contribution from the stellar surface , we fixed the normalization corresponding to 1  kpc .",
    "this results in the @xmath64 upper limits of the temperature and the thermal flux contribution to be @xmath65  ev and @xmath66  ergs  @xmath16  s@xmath5 ( 0.0110  kev ) , respectively .",
    "the fact that more than one pl index is required to explain the observed x - ray spectrum strongly suggests an additional x - ray contribution from this system besides the magnetospheric radiation . as possible orbital modulation in x - rays has been identified , the additional non - thermal component may come from the intrabinary shock  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our spectral analysis suggests that the emission below and above the break energy ( @xmath62  kev ) might have different origins .",
    "@xcite reported an x - ray pulsation for photons at 0.252.5  kev .",
    "whether the emission above @xmath62  kev is pulsed remains unclear .",
    "we performed an energy - resolved analysis of the x - ray flux as a function of orbital phase . according to the resultant break energy , we divided the energy range ( 0.310  kev ) suitable for timing analysis into two bands : 0.32  kev ( soft ) and 210  kev ( hard ) .",
    "we found no significant variability at the orbital period in both bands from xmm1 data , consistent with  @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to low photon statistics , as well as insufficient orbital coverage of @xmath691% for mos1/2 and @xmath682% for pn data .",
    "we therefore focused on the xmm2 data in this study .",
    "the orbital light curves of the soft and hard bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ xray_orbital ] .",
    "both soft and hard x - rays contribute to the orbital modulation and the troughs and peaks in the orbital light curves in these two bands occur at the same orbital phases ( around 0.2 and 0.6 respectively ) . using a @xmath67-test ,",
    "the significance for a flux modulation over the observed orbit in the soft and hard bands was found to be @xmath699.1% and @xmath685.5% , respectively .",
    "although the significance derived from this test is higher for soft x - rays than for hard x - rays , we could not determine the energy band for which the modulation is greater .",
    "we have found strong evidence for @xmath1-ray emission from a lmxb system , first  j102347.67@xmath0003841.2 . the @xmath1-rays may originate from psr  j1023@xmath00038 , or possibly from the intrabinary shock between the pulsar and its companion star .",
    "given the observed steep spectrum ( @xmath253 ) , synchrotron emission from the shock is not favored .",
    "we have applied an outer gap model to explain the observed @xmath1-rays .",
    "recently , @xcite suggest that such @xmath1-rays from a newly - born msp may be responsible for the disk clearance in such systems .",
    "our discovery of @xmath1-rays , once confirmed , from first  j102347.67@xmath0003841.2 conform with their predictions .",
    "the spectral analysis of the xmm data taken in 2004 and 2008 suggests that a broken pl well describes the x - ray data , with the lowest systematics , compared to a single pl and other composite models tested .",
    "our x - ray spectral analysis suggests that there exists two components and that both components appear to vary with the orbital phase , supporting the x - ray variability study by  @xcite , that suggested more than one mechanism contributes to the observed x - ray flux from j1023 .    in such a system that recently transited from the lmxb phase to the radio msp phase , we speculate that the current state may not be permanent as an accretion disk may reform about the ns in psr  j1023@xmath00038 switching off the radio msp .",
    "a cycle of on and off states of pulsar activity could repeat in the near future .",
