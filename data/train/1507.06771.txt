    "the extension of mesonic chiral perturbation theory @xcite to include heavier ( non - goldstone ) degrees of freedom is known to be a non - trivial problem . already in the one - nucleon sector",
    "it was found that higher - order loops contribute to lower - order calculations @xcite .",
    "this problem , also for the delta resonance included as a dynamical degree of freedom , has been solved in the framework of the heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite and later in the original manifestly lorentz - invariant formulations by using the infrared regularization and the extended on - mass - shell renormalization ( eoms ) @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to consistently include virtual ( axial- ) vector mesons in effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite for processes involving soft external pions and nucleons with small three - momenta . on the other hand , as the ( axial- ) vector mesons decay into light modes ( and",
    "therefore large imaginary parts appear ) , the issue of including ( axial- ) vector mesons in an eft for energies when the intermediate resonant states can be generated is still very problematic @xcite .",
    "first attempts have been made to handle this problem by applying the complex mass scheme @xcite in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to explicitly demonstrate the applicability of the complex - mass scheme to multi - loop diagrams . for",
    "that we analyze a two - loop self - energy diagram within the complex - mass scheme , similar to what was done in ref .  @xcite using the infrared regularization and the eoms renormalization .",
    "we show that the resulting renormalized expressions for the two - loop diagram indeed satisfy the power counting of the considered eft .",
    "we start with a two - loop self - energy diagram of the @xmath0-meson shown in fig .",

    "to properly subtract the two - loop integral of the previous section by applying the complex mass scheme without unnecessary complications due to the spin and chiral structure of the low - energy effective field theory , we focus here on an effective field theoretical model lagrangian of interacting scalar fields in six space - time dimensions @xmath8 where the masses of the scalar fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy the condition @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath10 represents an unstable particle ) .",
