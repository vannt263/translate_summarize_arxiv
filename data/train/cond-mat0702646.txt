    "understanding the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics in systems undergoing a glass transition is one of the key problems in condensed matter and statistical physics  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", research efforts have focused on the role of dynamical heterogeneity : as the glass transition is approached , the dynamics becomes increasingly correlated in space , since rearrangements are possible only through the cooperative motion of `` clusters '' of particles  @xcite .",
    "this cooperativity leads to strong temporal fluctuations of the dynamics . indeed , because of dynamical correlations , the number of statistically independent objects in the system becomes smaller than the number of particles , leading to enhanced fluctuations .",
    "numerical simulations have tested these features on a wide variety of systems  @xcite",
    ". experimental work , by contrast , is much more scarce , because probing the dynamics with the spatial and temporal resolution needed to highlight their heterogeneous nature is an arduous task , especially for molecular glass formers  @xcite .",
    "the slow dynamics of colloidal systems , foams and granular materials  @xcite share intriguing similarities with those of glass formers , including dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "these are experimentally more accessible than in molecular systems , since the relevant time and length scales are larger .",
    "various techniques have been used to characterize them , from direct space measurements  @xcite to novel scattering methods that probe the temporal fluctuations of the intensity correlation function  @xcite .",
    "valuable information on the physical origin of the average dynamics is generally obtained by studying its length scale dependence , e.g. the dependence of the intensity correlation function on the magnitude of the scattering vector @xmath1 in scattering experiments .",
    "similarly , one expects to gain a better understanding of dynamical heterogeneities by analyzing their behavior at different @xmath1 s .",
    "unfortunately , experimental and numerical or theoretical determinations of dynamical fluctuations as a function of @xmath1 are still very scarce  @xcite , leaving this issue an open question .    in this paper , we investigate dynamical fluctuations in colloidal gels made of moderately attractive carbon black ( cb ) particles , to which a dispersant is added to control the strength of the ( attractive ) interparticle interactions .",
    "we apply , to our knowledge for the first time , time - resolved scattering methods to x - photon correlation spectroscopy ( xpcs ) , thereby demonstrating that the dynamics of the cb gels are temporally heterogeneous .",
    "dynamical fluctuations are quantified by means of a @xmath1-dependent dynamical susceptibility , @xmath0 , similar to the dynamical susceptibility @xmath2 studied in simulations  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath0 is found to initially increase with @xmath1 , but eventually to decrease at large scattering vectors .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is in contrast with recent low-@xmath1 measurements on diluted , strongly attractive colloidal gels  @xcite , where dynamical fluctuations increased linearly with @xmath1 over one decade in scattering vector .",
    "we propose a simple scaling argument for the @xmath1-dependence of dynamical fluctuations in glassy systems , which reconciles these contrasting findings and rationalizes previously published data for granular media and glass formers  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : mm ] we present and characterize our experimental system and introduce shortly the time - resolved xpcs technique .",

    "our gels are made of cb particles of average radius @xmath3 nm , suspended in mineral oil at an effective volume fraction @xmath4 , as determined by viscosity measurements ( see below ) .",
    "the particles have a conveniently high scattering cross section for x - rays .",
    "they are fractal aggregates made of permanently fused primary particles ( fractal dimension @xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the primary particles ranges from 20 to 40 nm , as determined by electron microscopy .",
    "however , the smallest units in our samples are effectively the cb particles themselves and not the primary particles , since the cb particles can not be broken , neither by thermal fluctuations , nor by adding a dispersant or by applying a large shear , e.g. during rheology tests or sonication . the size and polydispersity of the cb particles",
    "were determined by applying the cumulant analysis described in ref .",
    "@xcite to intensity correlation functions measured by dynamic light scattering ( dls ) at @xmath6 ( scattering angle @xmath7 deg ) .",
    "a very diluted ( @xmath8 ) and fully dispersed sample of cb - particles in mineral oil was prepared for the dls measurements .",
    "for spherical , monodisperse particles , one expects @xmath9 to relax exponentially ; deviations due to shape and/or size polydispersity may be quantified by the ratio @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12th coefficient of a cumulant expansion : @xmath13^{0.5}\\ } = \\kappa_0 - \\kappa_1\\tau + \\kappa_2\\tau^2/2 + ... $ ]  @xcite .",

    "@xcite to particles with a fractal morphology , one finds that in the low-@xmath1 limit ( @xmath16 ) the first two cumulants are related to the average translational diffusion coefficient , @xmath17 , and its relative variance , @xmath18 , by the following expressions :    @xmath19    with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 the temperature and @xmath23 the boltzman s constant . here",

    ". the average particle radius and its relative variance , @xmath28 , may be obtained from @xmath29 and @xmath30 provided that @xmath26 is known . since for moderate polydispersity",
    "the exact shape of @xmath26 has little influence on the final result , we choose a generalized exponential ( or schulz ) distribution , for which calculations can be performed analytically  @xcite . by taking for simplicity @xmath31 ( very close to the value 2.2 of our particles ) , one finds @xmath32 yielding for our cb particles @xmath3 nm and @xmath33 .    _ determination of the volume fraction _ the particle concentration of the two cb gels studied here is 2% w / w .",
    "the effective volume fraction corresponding to this weight fraction was determined by measuring the viscosity of a suspension where the cb particles were fully dispersed ( 1.6% w / w dispersant ) .",
    "the effective hydrodynamic volume fraction , @xmath34 , is estimated using  @xcite @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the shear - independent viscosity of the mineral oil and @xmath37 is the high shear rate viscosity of the suspension .",
    "the value @xmath4 thus obtained was found to be consistent with that obtained by measuring the low - shear viscosity of the suspension , @xmath38 , and using  @xcite @xmath39 .",
    "_ estimate of the depth of the particle - particle interaction potential . _",
    "the attraction between cb particles is controlled by the amount of added dispersant .",
    "the depth of the well of the particle - particle interaction potential , @xmath40 , may be estimated by studying the mechanical response of the cb gels . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relaxation spectrum ( as measured by oscillatory rheology ) of cb suspensions and its dependence on volume fraction is essentially identical to that obtained for model systems of nearly monodisperse spherical particles that interact via a short - ranged potential induced by the depletion mechanism .",
    "therefore , we use the non - equilibrium state diagram of the depletion systems with known depth of the interaction potential to evaluate @xmath40 for our cb gels . the diagram is shown in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite : the control parameters are @xmath34 and @xmath40 ; a line @xmath41 separates the systems with solid - like mechanical behavior ( upper part of the diagram ) to those with a liquid - like behavior ( lower part ) . for the cb gel with 0.2% dispersant , we find that the elastic modulus is very low ( @xmath42 pa ) , which indicates that this system corresponds to a state close to the fluid - solid boundary .",
    "figure 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that for short ranged potentials the boundary corresponds to @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we assign @xmath45 to the cb gel at @xmath44 and with 0.2% dispersant .    for the cb - system with 0% dispersant , we take advantage of the dependence of the elastic modulus on dispersant concentration , which was found to exhibit a critical - like behavior , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 pa  @xcite .",
    "we measure @xmath49 pa for the cb gel without dispersant , yielding @xmath50 .",
    "_ sample preparation . _",
    "the cb suspensions are prepared from a stock suspension of 4% w / w carbon black ( cabot vulcan xc72 ) in light mineral oil ( aldrich ) .",
    "the stock solution is made by first mixing the carbon black powder into the mineral oil using a standard household mixer .",
    "subsequently , it is thoroughly sonicated for  1 hour using an ultrasound device ( hielscher up200h ) operating at a power of 120 w and a frequency of 24 khz . to avoid overheating , the suspension",
    "is placed in an ice bath and sonication is run in cycles of 1 s. the stock solution is then left to equilibrate for 2 days , before it is used to prepare the final samples . before diluting the sample to a final concentration of 2% w / w cb ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) , the stock suspension is again thoroughly mixed ; the final samples are then prepared by adding either pure mineral oil or a solution of dispersant in mineral oil ; they are mixed and left to equilibrate for 2 days .",
    "prior to the xpcs experiments , the samples are again thoroughly mixed and subsequently injected in a 1 mm ( inner diameter ) cylindrical capillary .",
    "the capillary is sealed and placed in a water bath in which we introduce our ultrasound device , thereby submitting the sample to a final indirect sonication step ( 120 w and 24 khz ) for about half an hour .",
    "we define the age of sample , @xmath52 , as being the time elapsed since this final sonication step .",
    "note that sonication breaks up any aggregates that may have been formed between the cb particles , without affecting the integrity of the cb particles themselves .",
    "_ average dynamics . _",
    "the dynamics of the cb gels are investigated by means of xpcs performed at the id10 troika beamline at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , with x - rays of wavelength @xmath53  .",
    "the scattering volume has a cylindrical shape , with diameter 12 @xmath36 m and length 1 mm ( along the horizontal direction ) , defined by the beam size and the capillary diameter , respectively .",
    "the scattered intensity is recorded by a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera , covering about one decade in scattering vector : @xmath54 , corresponding to distances comparable to or smaller than the cb particle size .",
    "xpcs measurements start at age @xmath55 min : we find that the dynamics initially slows down , as observed for many glassy systems  @xcite , but that after a few hours a stationary state is attained .",
    "all measurements presented in this work start at @xmath56 hours , well in the stationary regime , and last typically up to 3 hours .",
    "mechanical and beam instabilities are a concern when measuring very slow dynamics , especially in xpcs experiments . by using a static scatterer ( vycor glass ) , we have checked that the setup was stable up to @xmath57 sec , longer than the relevant time scales in our experiments .    in order to measure the average dynamics and its fluctuations , we use the time - resolved correlation ( trc ) method  @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous degree of correlation between x photons scattered at time @xmath58 and @xmath59 is measured according to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the scattered intensity at pixel @xmath62 and time @xmath58 and @xmath63 is an average over a ring of pixels corresponding to approximately the same magnitude of @xmath64 but different azimuthal orientations .",

    "the values of @xmath84 thus obtained are taken as an estimate of the error bars on @xmath0 at all delays , and will be used in particularly in fig .",

    "figure 2a shows @xmath9 for the cb gel with @xmath95 , at various @xmath1 .",
    "the intensity correlation function exhibits a two - step decay , whose physical origin we shall discuss later .",
    "figure  [ fig:2]b displays the @xmath15-dependent amplitude of the noise - corrected fluctuations of the dynamics , @xmath76 ; at all @xmath1 s , @xmath0 exhibits a peaked shape , strongly reminiscent of that observed in a variety of glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "the peak of the dynamical susceptibility , @xmath96 , occurs at a time delay @xmath97 of the same order of magnitude of the decay time associated with the initial relaxation of @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , a shoulder in @xmath98 is observed on the time scale of the final relaxation of @xmath9 .    to gain insight on the physical origin of the slow dynamics , it would be desirable to quantify the decay of @xmath67 by fitting its relaxation by an appropriate function , such as the combination of two ( stretched ) exponential functions .",
    "however , due to the limited image acquisition rate , the initial decay of @xmath9 is only partially captured in our experiments , especially at the largest @xmath1 vectors . as a consequence , a direct fit of the initial relaxation is not reliable . as an alternative procedure , we use a scaling analysis similar to that adopted in several photon correlation spectroscopy works ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , as shown for the gel with @xmath99 in fig .",
    "we first scale the lag - time axis by @xmath97 , the lag corresponding to the peak of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath0 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that , quite generally , for glassy systems @xmath100 is of the same order of magnitude of and proportional to the system relaxation time ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , our @xmath0 data exhibit a remarkable scaling behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "this allows us to determine @xmath100 at all @xmath1 with an uncertainty smaller than the temporal resolution of the ccd camera ( 2 sec ) .",
    "we finalize our scaling procedure of the correlation function by normalizing @xmath9 with a @xmath1-dependent amplitude , @xmath101 , which leads to a collapse of all our @xmath1-dependent data in the lag - time - range of the initial decay . to determine the shape of the initial decay , we assume that the data can be modeled by a stretched exponential decay , @xmath102 $ ] , and search for the stretching exponent @xmath103 that best linearizes our data plotted as @xmath104-\\ln a(q)$ ] versus @xmath105 , where we find an optimum value of @xmath106 . as shown in fig .",
    "3a , a very good scaling onto a straight line is obtained for @xmath107 ; at larger lags the data curve upwards , because the initial decay of @xmath67 is followed by a ( tilted ) plateau , as seen in fig .",
    "the same scaling procedure is also used to characterize the initial decay for the gel with @xmath108 , for which we find @xmath109 ( data not shown ) .",
    "figure 4 shows some representative intensity correlation functions for both gels ( symbols ) , together with the fits issued from the scaling analysis ( lines ) .",
    "a full relaxation of @xmath67 is observed only for the gel with @xmath85 , whose final decay is well approximated by a single exponential as shown in fig .",
    "the fact that for the gel with @xmath110 no final relaxation of @xmath67 is observed in the accessible time scale is most probably due to the deeper interparticle potential well that makes particle displacements more difficult .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath91 , the characteristic time of the initial relaxation of @xmath9 , is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a for the gel with @xmath111 .",

    "[ fig:2]a as a continuous line ( similar results are also obtained for the gel with @xmath113 ) .",
    "we can exclude that the initial relaxation of @xmath67 is due to thermally induced fluctuations of the gel branches @xcite , which we expect to exhibit characteristic times at least three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , both the nearly @xmath114-dependence of @xmath91 and @xmath115 suggest that the dynamics is determined by stress - induced rearrangements similar to those of other soft glassy materials ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the final decay of the correlation function is approximately exponential , with a decay time @xmath92 that is @xmath1-independent .",
    "this behavior most probably stems from random rare rearrangements occurring when bonds are broken , leading to particle displacements larger than @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , in this case we expect one single rearrangement to be sufficient to fully decorrelate the contribution of the displaced scatterers to @xmath9 .",
    "the only time scale for the final relaxation of @xmath67 is then the average time between rearrangements , regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "assuming uncorrelated events with poissonian statistics , one expects an exponential decay of @xmath67 , in agreement with our measurements . as mentioned before , for the cb gel with no dispersant ( @xmath110 ) no final relaxation",
    "is observed within our experimentally accessible time window ; this is most likely due to a decrease in the rate of bond breaking as @xmath40 increases .    .",

    "5 . for both gels",
    ", we find that @xmath117 first increases with @xmath1 , reaches a maximum value at @xmath118 and then decreases at larger scattering vectors .",
    "moreover , we find that the dynamical fluctuations are more pronounced for the gel with the deeper interparticle potential well . this can be intuitively understood as the size of the regions that rearrange cooperatively is presumably larger in gels with stronger interparticle interactions , leading to larger dynamical fluctuations .",
    "additionally , it is conceivable that the relaxation process itself is more heterogeneous in time for stronger gels , where internal stress build - up and release is likely to be more important , further contributing to enhanced fluctuations . as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 should in principle be normalized by the ( @xmath1-dependent ) squared amplitude of the relaxation of @xmath9 , to allow for an explicit comparison of data obtained at different @xmath1 s .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", such a correction is affected by a large uncertainty , since the short - time behavior of @xmath67 is barely accessible to the ccd .",

    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "although the data are more noisy , the peaked shape observed in the main plot is preserved .",

    "one may wonder whether this discrepancy stems from a difference in the particle morphology or polydispersity .",
    "however , cb suspensions have been found to exhibit the same relaxation spectrum ( as measured by rheology ) as model systems consisting of spherical , nearly monodisperse colloids interacting via short - ranged depletion forces  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamical properties reported here are likely to be generic for colloidal gels with moderate attractive interactions . instead , we propose that the different @xmath1-dependence of @xmath96 arises from the different @xmath1 and @xmath40 ranges probed in this work compared to  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we introduce a simple yet general scaling argument for the length - scale dependence of dynamical fluctuations in glassy systems that reconciles these contrasting observations .",
    "we assume the dynamics to be due to random rearrangement events each affecting a `` blob '' of volume @xmath121 .",

    "we stress that in general both @xmath137 and @xmath128 are @xmath1-dependent quantities .",
    "indeed , @xmath128 decreases as @xmath1 increases , because fewer events are needed to displace the particles over the smaller distances corresponding to larger scattering vectors .",
    "more specifically , in our model the average number of events is proportional to time and thus we expect @xmath138 . for uncorrelated particle displacements due to successive events ( `` brownian - like '' rearrangements ) , @xmath139 . by contrast ,",
    "@xmath140 if the displacement direction persists over several events ( `` ballistic - like '' rearrangements ) , as found for our cb gels and other systems with internal stress - driven dynamics @xcite .",

    ", we have shown that the dynamics of cb gels is temporally heterogeneous .",
    "dynamical fluctuations increase with @xmath1 , peak around the inverse particle size , and decrease at larger scattering vectors .",
    "this behavior and that of other systems can be rationalized by a simple scaling argument , providing a general framework for understanding temporal fluctuations of the dynamics in glassy systems .",
    "additionally , our measurements demonstrate that xpcs may be used to obtain quantitative information not only on the average dynamics , but also on its heterogenous behavior .",
    "this opens a new way to investigate dynamical heterogeneity in a wide variety of materials , possibly including molecular glass formers , whose characteristic length scales match those probed by xpcs , provided that a high enough signal can be collected .",
