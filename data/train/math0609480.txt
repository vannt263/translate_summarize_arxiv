    "the starting point of this note is the representation of the reciprocal of the riemann zeta function by means of the pochammer s polynomials @xmath7 ( where _ z _ is a complex variable ) , whose coefficients @xmath3 have been introduced by baez - duarte for the riesz case ( @xmath8 ) . for the study of the coefficients @xmath3 , some recent analytical as well as numerical results have been obtained [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] . for a rigorous treatment of the mntz formula to the finding of new zero free regions of the riemann zeta function , the reader may consult the work of albeverio and cebulla [ 1 ] .    using the baez - duarte approach ,",
    "the representation of @xmath9 may be obtained for a family of a two parameter pochammer s polynomials ( parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 [ 4 ] ) and reads : @xmath12    where @xmath13 @xmath14    the expression for @xmath3 we will use in our computation is given by : @xmath15    which for large _",
    "k _ is a correct formula for the @xmath3 given above ( see appendix ) . from a theorem of baez - duarte",
    "[ 2 , 3 ] , an important inequality concerning the pochammer s polynomials is given by : @xmath16    the inequality , when applied to our family of pochammer s polynomials gives : @xmath17    from this it follows [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] that the rh will be true , i.e. that @xmath18 in the representation above will be different from infinity ( no zero of @xmath19 for @xmath20 ) if @xmath21 .",
    "for the numerical study it is convenient to introduce the variable @xmath22 , in term of which we define the critical function corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is given by : @xmath23    2000 is the maximum argument _",
    "n _ used in these experiments , which for the special case we treat ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) @xmath24 will be calculated up to @xmath25 ( this corresponds to @xmath26 ) .",
    "before we present the results of our numerical experiments for various values of @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) it is important to give the explicit expression of the contribution of the non trivial ( @xmath29 ) and also of the trivial zeros ( @xmath30 ) to the critical function defined above for the general case @xmath10 and @xmath11 , following the expression given by baez - duarte for the case @xmath31 [ 2 ] .",
    "for the non trivial zeros , in the variable @xmath32 , at @xmath27 , it is given by : @xmath33    where _ z _ is any nontrivial zero of @xmath34 .",
    "in our experiments we will limit to the contribution of the first two lower zeros given experimentally by @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the complex conjugate of them .",
    "the corresponding contribution will be denoted by @xmath37 ( from @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 ( from @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the contribution of the trivial zeros @xmath43 for every integers _",
    "n _ , to the critical function is given by : @xmath44    where a summation until @xmath45 will be sufficient .",
    "so , in our calculations we will set @xmath0 and @xmath46 in the above formulas , for any value of @xmath27 we shall consider .",
    "the contribution @xmath30 for @xmath47 will be indicated with @xmath48 .",
    "below we present the results of our numerical experiments performed using maple 10 , where as anticipated the maximum argument in the mbius function present in the definition of the critical function ( essentially @xmath3 ) , is @xmath2 .",
    "the fluctuations errors around 2000 will be specified in the appendix .",
    "in fig . 1 we give the plot of the two functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 up to @xmath25 which shows a very good agreement .",
    "notice that we have taken into account only the contribution of the first two nontrivial zeros in the baez - duarte asymptotic formula for the @xmath3 .",
    "for the riesz case ( @xmath8 ) , the contribution of the trivial zeros to the @xmath3 have been treated by maslanka using the rice s integrals [ 8 ] .",
    "[ red ] and @xmath51 [ green ] up to @xmath25,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we present the the plot of the two functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 up to @xmath25 which shows not only a good agreement but also the oscillatory behaviour of the contribution of the first two nontrivial zeros .",
    "[ red ] and @xmath54 [ green ] up to @xmath25,width=302 ]    in the next fig .",
    "3 we present the plots of some critical functions ( @xmath55 ) corresponding to different values of @xmath27 using ( 1.7 ) and this without any comparison with the baez - duarte asymptotic expansion considered above . it is to be noted that all functions @xmath55 has the same zeros and we observe that there is a well marked evidence that for @xmath56 increasing to 1 the amplitudes decay while for @xmath57 the amplitudes grow .",
    "these functions have been indicated with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 respectively .",
    "it should be said that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we have considered , have no relation with the representation of @xmath9 which is valid only for @xmath4 .",
    "the two functions help only to visualize that @xmath62 is the borderline for the critical functions decaying for @xmath6 as suggested by our numerical experiments up to @xmath25 .",
    "it should also be added that from the duality relation ( riemann symmetry of the zeta function ) , given by :   @xmath65    it follows that the right hand side of ( 2.1 ) ensures a representation of @xmath18 via the pochammer s polynomials in the region @xmath66 .     for @xmath28 up to @xmath25 , in order of increasing amplitudes , width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "4 we present the result for a special case where we allow a slower decrease in the critical function ( see addendum in the exponent of the critical function ) , which is the same as to say that we ask only for a slower decay of @xmath3 , at @xmath67 i.e. of the type @xmath68 for the case considered .",
    "this is not the same as to ask that rh is true or that rh is true with nontrivial zeros which are simple [ 3 ] .",
    "it is a case in between the two .    in this case",
    "the critical function ( indicated with @xmath69 ) is explicitly given by : @xmath70     , width=302 ]    here there is more evidence that the amplitude of the wave at @xmath71 is decreasing with @xmath32 .",
    "the experiments of fig .",
    "3 give in any cases a stronger evidence : that for @xmath72 the amplitudes of the waves are decaying , and thus are bounded in amplitude by a constant .",
    "this is a symptom of the absence of nontrivial zeros in the critical segment @xmath73 .    in the last experiment we set @xmath74 and compare @xmath75 with the asymptotic expression of baez - duarte : for the trivial zeros we set @xmath74 in the above formula , for the nontrivial zeros ( the two we consider ) we keep the same value of @xmath76 but we assume that their real part is @xmath77 . the plot in fig",
    "5 of the function @xmath78 and of @xmath79 are clearly different : in @xmath60 there is the trace via the mbius function of where the nontrivial zeros are located and thus the amplitude is decaying . in the second function , the two considered zeros are supposed to have @xmath80 and the wave which appears seems to have a constant amplitude as in the case @xmath62 which of course would be sufficient to ensure the truth of the rh .     [ red ] and",
    "@xmath79 [ green],width=302 ]    in appendix we analyse a ( weak ) stability property of our results obtained with @xmath2 in the mbius function and give some indications why the waves for @xmath74 should be decaying , thus ensuring more credibility on the absence of zeros of the riemann zeta function in the segment @xmath81 .",
    "in this work we have analyzed numerically the behaviour of the riesz and hardy - littlewood wave ( the critical function ) in some details for the case @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the region up to about @xmath82 milliard for various values of @xmath27 in the critical segment @xmath83 . in the variable @xmath22 up to 14 oscillations have been detected whose amplitude has been compared with the one calculated with the expansion of baez - duarte using the trivial zeros and only the two lower nontrivial zeros .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory and the results give some indication in the direction to believe that at least for @xmath84 there are no nontrivial zeros of @xmath85 since in the representation @xmath18 seems to remain bounded .",
    "in addition , we have given some evidence that a slow decay of @xmath3 like @xmath86 in between to the decay @xmath87 ( rh for the model ) and @xmath88 ( rh for the model with simple zeros ) is possible in the range @xmath89 .",
    "a further study in this direction but by means of two new representations of the zeta function with coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 and other type of oscillations will be presented in the near future .",
    "we consider the critical function @xmath78 obtained with @xmath2 ( maximum argument in the mbius function appearing in the baez - duarte definition of the @xmath3 ) .",
    "we will suppose that the numerical results are given with good accuracy ; we now ask : if we increase _",
    "n _ from 2000 up to @xmath92 in a ideal experiment , what will be the change of the critical function in the range @xmath93 ? @xmath94 @xmath95            with the solution @xmath104 . thus for @xmath104 , the amplitudes will change at most @xmath99 time of its value 0.015",
    ". this shows some stability in the numerical experiments as _ n _ increases in a ideal experiment .",
    "of course this is independent of how many zeros are employed in the baez - duarte estimation .",
    "finally , application of the crude inequality as above shows [ 5 ] that for larger values of _ x _ , with _",
    "n _ sufficiently big , the numerical results of an ideal experiment using the mbius function in @xmath3 will give a value of the amplitude for example smaller then @xmath105 of 0.015 ( still with @xmath2 at @xmath106 , with @xmath107 at @xmath108 ) , indicating that the value of the amplitude becomes possibly smaller .",
    "this is an indication in the direction to believe that for @xmath109 there are no nontrivial zeros of the zeta function .",
    "again , as above , the crude inequality @xmath112 may be used to show that the difference between the two functions i.e. the fluctuations become smaller as _ k _ get bigger and depends on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in fact they behave unconditionally as : @xmath113"
