    "it might as well be beneficial for the search of alps as the signal - to - noise ratio for photons transmitted through the analyzer improves notably .",
    "however , this study would require to incorporate the focusing effects , which is still beyond the scope of this work .",
    "if the planned hibef experiment was driven by the strong field to be reached at eli [ @xmath263 , @xmath245 , @xmath264 , corresponding to @xmath265 , and the sensitivity remained within the same order of magnitude @xmath266 , the limits above would be pushed down to @xmath267 [ gaussian model ] and @xmath268 [ @xmath166pulse ] at the resonant mass @xmath259 .",
    "the projected areas to be excluded from the ellipticity [ rotation angle ] can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mb003 ] in black [ brown ] .",
    "we emphasize that the pulse at eli is expected to be strongly focused [ @xmath269 .",
    "hence , the exclusion areas found for this setup are expected to be trustworthy as long as @xmath270 .",
    "our estimates reveal that the shape of the bounds resulting from the ellipticity almost coincide for both pulse models . however , the borders of the excluded areas coming from the rotation angle differ from each other more strongly .",
    "the described behavior is even more pronounced when both observables are probed with an optical laser beam and the envisaged eli laser drives the vacuum polarization .",
    "the potential exclusion regions associated with this case are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mb003 ] in blue [ ellipticity ] and purple [ rotation angle ] .",
    "they have been found by supposing a sensitivity of the order of @xmath271 , a probe frequency @xmath272 and a probe intensity much smaller than the one of the strong laser field .",
    "we remark that the outcomes resulting from this hypothetical setup were obtained by considering a counterpropagating geometry @xmath273 and an initial polarization angle @xmath254 .    to conclude , we study a situation in which the strong field is generated by the nanosecond front - end of the phelix laser @xcite , [ @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 , corresponding to @xmath278 .",
    "it is worth mentionig that the electromagnetic pulse produced by this system closely approaches to a monochromatic plane wave as the conditions @xmath279 and @xmath280 are fulfilled simultaneously .",
    "the potential exclusion bounds which follow from this setup are valid whenever the condition @xmath281 is satisfied . as in the previous case , we take the probe beam with a doubled frequency @xmath282 . besides , we suppose that its intensity and waist size are much smaller than the corresponding quantities of the strong field . assuming some achievable conditions such as @xmath254 , a counter propagating geometry and a sensitivity @xmath283 , we find that the area shaded in cyan [ fig .  [",
    "fig : mb003 ] ] could be excluded potentially .",
    "this projected result shows that large sensitivities can be achieved , provided the number of cycles @xmath169 is large enough to compensate for the relative smallness of the laser intensity @xmath284 .",
    "we have studied the discovery potential that modern and envisaged laser systems offer in the search for alps .",
    "our investigation reveals that laser - based setups , designed to detect the hitherto unobserved qed vacuum birefringence , may provide stringent bounds on the alp - diphoton coupling @xmath2 in mass regions where the constraints resulting from experiments driven by dipole magnets are considerably less severe .",
    "special attention has been paid to the consequences resulting from the pulse profile function , which were evaluated by solving perturbatively the system of equations describing the oscillation of photons into alps mediated by a generic plane - wave background .",
    "our analysis points out that a broad sector of the parameter space of alps might be discarded , no matter what type of strong field profile is utilized .",
    "the precise location of the projected exclusion areas will depend , in general , on the chosen pulse profile and the cep .",
    "however , a direct comparison between two pulses with different envelope has indicated that the outcomes resulting from the ellipticity are less sensitive to this dependence than the bounds arising from a plausible rotation of the polarization plane . besides",
    ", we have pointed out that an appropriate choice of the cep may optimize the alps search ."
