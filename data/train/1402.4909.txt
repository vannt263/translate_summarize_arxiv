    "the charge transport properties of quantum wires ( qws ) formed in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by a split gate technique @xcite have been investigated extensively because they are the building blocks of future integrated circuits . the mainly features of these quasi - one - dimensional systems are charge conductance quantization and quantum interference effects , which can be interpreted by the discrete subbands in the energy dispersion and the landauer - b@xmath0ttiker formalism @xcite .",
    "recently , much more attention has also been paid to another degree of freedom of electron , i.e. spin transport in these systems @xcite , since the prototype of the spin field - effect - transistor ( sfet ) proposed by datta and das @xcite . in the sfet ,",
    "spin - polarized electrons are injected from a ferromagnetic lead to a qw , and then the spin is precessed in the wire because the electrons experience an effective magnetic field induced by spin - orbit coupling ( soc , often referred to rashba one @xcite or dresselhaus one @xcite ) during transport , and finally the spin is detected by another ferromagnetic lead . as the soc presents in the qw , all the spin - degenerated subbands are lifted except for at the wave vector @xmath1 . therefore , the soc effect will produce a phase shift of the transmitted electrons @xmath2 @xcite , here @xmath3 is the effective mass of electron , @xmath4 is the soc strength , and _",
    "d _ is the transmission distance and @xmath5 the reduced plank constant . more importantly ,",
    "the rashba soc strength has achieved to be tuned by an external electric field in experiment @xcite , which provides the potential application of soc - based spintronics devices in practice .",
    "in addition to the soc , the electron spin in qws is also sensitive to the external magnetic field ( mf ) or the proximate ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "differing from the case of soc , the spin - degenerated subbands are lifted to landau levels and each level is spin split at all the wave vector due to the wave - vector - independent zeeman effect @xcite .",
    "however , the zeeman spin split @xmath6 is very small because of the strong reduction of the effective electron mass ( e.g. @xmath7 in gaas / algaas heterostructure ) and the very low effective land@xmath8 factor @xmath9 in semiconductor materials @xcite , where @xmath10 is bohr magneton , @xmath11 is the mf strength and @xmath12 the mass of free electron .",
    "further , charge and spin transport in a qw is possible only via chiral edge modes when the mf is strong enough and with strong a robustness against disorders .",
    "more recently , there have also been numerous studies on the spin transport in qws in the presence of both soc(s ) and an exteral mf .",
    "the interplay of the soc(s ) and mf brings to many new effects .",
    "the first one is the modification of the energy dispersion and conductance . in a rashba qw with a perpendicular mf",
    ", the rashba soc also leads to a zeeman - like energy - band split @xcite besides the zeeman spin split caused by the mf .",
    "however , this type of energy - band split is subband dependent and has a complex dependence on the mf due to the variance of the expectance of the spin angular momentum operator along the width of the wire @xcite .",
    "however , the rashba spin precession in quantum - hall edge modes is similar to that of rashba - split qw when the mf is strong @xcite . in a qw with socs due to different mechanisms such as rashba and dresselhaus , as well as the lateral confining potential",
    ", the interaction between these socs and the external mf would affect the transport and optical properties @xcite , and the subbands anticrossings @xcite dramatically .",
    "further , additional subband extrema and energy gap are also found in a rashba qw with an in - plane mf @xcite .",
    "the second one is the modification of the transversal spin texture . in the rashba qw with an in - plane mf , the spin _ x , y _ and _ z _ magnetization along the transversal direction are strongly dependent on the _ k _ value and subband index when the rashba intersubband coupling is taken into account @xcite . in the rashba qw with a perpendicular mf",
    ", additional spin texturing is introduced , and a @xmath13 phase shift between the modulations of the spin density components along the external mf direction and along the direction of the rashba - induced effective magnetic field is observed @xcite . however , this effect will disappear when the mf is stronger than the rashba - induced effective magnetic field , which is quite different from the dresselhaus qw @xcite .",
    "in addition , other effects including a beating pattern in magnetoresistance @xcite , transverse electron focusing @xcite , resonance spin hall conductance @xcite and the suppression of resonance transmission @xcite have also been found in these systems .    in most works mentioned above , the spin - related transport in the system",
    "is investigated for a spin - polarized injection . moreover ,",
    "only the transversal spin texture has been analyzed , while the longitudinal spin texture has not been considered seriously thus far . in this paper , using the extended usuki transfer - matrix method @xcite combined with the landauer - b@xmath0ttiker formula , we numerically calculate the spin conductance and the spin - polarized density distributions inside the rashba qw in the presence of a perpendicular mf for a spin - unpolarized injection .",
    "wide energy windows with three - component spin conductance can be achieved in this system due to the rashba_zeeman effect , which is quite different from those of the qw with only a perpendicular mf .",
    "moreover , not only the width of these energy windows but also the magnitude of the spin conductance within these energy windows can be controlled by tuning the rashba soc strength , which can be interpreted respectively by the energy dispersion and the spin - polarized density distributions .",
    "further study also shows that the spin conductance within these energy windows is robust against the scattering caused by impurities in the real qw .",
    "thereby , the considered system may find applications in future spintronics devices .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the theoretical model and the spin - resolved usuki transfer - matrix method are presented .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are shown in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the qw studied in present paper is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 , which is located in a perpendicular mf and sandwiched between two normal metal leads with the same width @xmath14 as that of the qw .",
    "only the soc arising from rashba mechanism is considered since its domination in this structure and its strength can be controlled by an external electrical field . in order to eliminate the scattering at the interfaces , two buffering regions @xcite ( with lengths @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) with adiabatically variable rashba soc and mf strengths",
    "are assumed to be situated between the leads and the middle region ( with a length @xmath17 ) with constant ones .",
    "spin - unpolarized electrons are injected from the left lead and then transported longitudinally along @xmath18-axis and confined transversely along @xmath19-axis and normally along @xmath20-axis .    using the landau gauge ,",
    "the vector potential is expressed by @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath20-axis is chosen as the spin - quantized axis so that @xmath22 ( here @xmath23 means transposition ) represents the spin - up state , @xmath24 denotes the spin - down state , and the pauli matrix expressions are @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] . under these conditions ,",

    "further , all these energy windows are identical and with the same width and magnitude . however , for the qw with both rashba soc and a perpendicular mf , the transmission spin conductance shows more complicate behaviors .",
    "first , all three components of the transmission spin conductance , as shown respectively in figs .",
    "3(b ) , 3(c ) and 3(d ) , are generated when the electron energy is situated within the energy windows caused by rashba_zeeman spin split .",

    "3(b ) , 3(c ) and 3(d ) , where the electron energy is set at @xmath127 ( as indicated by the yellow vertical lines ) .",
    "this effect is attributed to interaction between the effective magnetic field induced by the rashba soc and the zeeman spin split , resulting in the variance of the spin conductance .",
    "final , the widths of these energy windows are sensitive to the subband index and rashba soc strength . the width of each energy widow is enlarged with the increase of rashba soc strength and can be distinguished from each other for the weak rashba soc strength . however , as the rashba soc strength is increased further , each neighboring two energy window will overlap , leading to the generation of spin conductance at all electron energies .    in order to understand the spin conductance of the qw in the presence of both rashba soc and a perpendicular mf obtained in figs .",
    "3 , the @xmath20-component spin - polarized density distributions inside the qw at different electron energies and rashba soc strengths are plotted in fig .",

    "highly spin - polarized density island with negative sign is formed in the buffering region to the left , originating from the interaction between the bound state and the external mf and the effective mf induced by rashba soc @xcite .",
    "however , spin - polarized density ribbon with positive sign is observed in the lower edge of the middle region of the qw , which is attributed to the interaction between the chiral edge state caused by the external mf and the rashba soc .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the spin - polarized density ribbon can be tuned by varying the electron energy within the energy windows and the rashba soc strength , which consists with the spin conductance properties of the whole system shown in fig .",
    "3 . in addition ,",
    "the spin - polarized density distributions of the @xmath18- and @xmath19-component inside the qw display the same features as those of the @xmath20-component so that not be presented here .",
    "the above calculations assume a perfectly qw , where there is no elastic or inelastic scattering .",
    "however , in a realistic qw , there will be many impurities in the sample .",
    "consequently , the effect of disorder on the spin - dependent transport in the real qw should be considered in practical applications .",
    "the effects of impurities can be introduced by fluctuation of the diagonal terms of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which are distributed randomly within a range of width @xmath132 : @xmath133 , here @xmath134 .",
    "figure 5 shows the average transmission charge and spin conductances as a function of the electron energy for weak ( @xmath135 , the red dashed lines ) and strong ( @xmath136 , the blue dotted lines ) disorder strengths .",
    "number of the real samples taken for calculating the average values is @xmath137 .",
    "in contrast to the transmission charge conductance of the perfect qw with the same parameters ( the black solid line ) , as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the step - like structures disappear in the average charge conductance as disorder presents in the qw .",
    "moreover , dip - like structures emerge at the average charge conductance and their positions just around the ends of the charge conductance steps , resulting from the interplay of the disorder - induced bound states and the continued states in the leads .",
    "however , the amplitude of the transmission charge conductance does not drop much even when the strong disorder is presented in the qw .",
    "similar to the average charge conductance , the average spin conductance within the energy windows is also destroyed by the disorder , as shown in figs .",
    "5(b ) , 5(c ) and 5(d ) . however , the magnitude of the average spin conductance within the energy windows is still large even in the presence of a strong disorder , especially for the lower energy windows .",
    "these effects may be attributed to the edge state caused by the mf , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , which is immune from the scatter of the impurities . therefore",
    ", both the charge and spin conductances can survive in the disordered qw .",
    "in conclusion , spin - dependent transport properties of a qw in the presence of both rashba soc and a perpendicular mf for a spin - unpolarized injection is studied by using the extended usuki transfer - matrix method together with the landauer - b@xmath0ttiker formalism .",
    "a spin - polarized current of three components can be generated in the output lead when the electron energy lies in the energy gaps induced by the rashba_zeeman effects and its magnitude can be controlled by varying the rashba strength .",
    "the mechanism of the generated spin - polarized current in the output lead is clarified by analyzing both the transversal and longitudinal spin - polarized density inside the qw .",
    "further study also shows that the spin - polarized current can survive even in the presence of a strong disorder .",
    "although an external mf is needed to achieve the spin - polarized current , it is only used to break the time inversion symmetry .",
    "the width of spin - filtering energy gaps and the magnitude of the spin - polarized current is also manipulated by varying the rashba soc strength , indicating that the considered system may has a potential application in designing a spin filter device .",

    "<S> we perform a numerical study on the spin - resolved transport in a quantum wire ( qw ) under the modulation of both rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and a perpendicular magnetic field ( mf ) by adopting the developed usuki transfer - matrix method in combination with the landauer - b@xmath0ttiker formalism . </S>",
    "<S> wide spin filtering energy windows can be achieved in this system for a spin - unpolarized injection . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , both the width of these energy windows and the magnitude of the spin conductance within these energy widows can be tuned by varying the rashba soc strength , which can be apprehended by analyzing the energy dispersions and the spin - polarized density distributions inside the qw , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> further study also demonstrates that these rashba - soc - controlled spin filtering energy windows show a strong robustness against disorders . </S>",
    "<S> these findings may not only benefit to further understand the spin - dependent transport properties of the qw in the presence of external fields but also provide a theoretical instruction to design a spin filter device . </S>"
