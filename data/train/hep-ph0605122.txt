    "one of the most spectacular cosmic events is a supernova ( sn ) explosion which ends the existence of a giant star .",
    "there are two types of such explosions : types i and ii . in the case of type",
    "i supernovae the explosion gives out gigantic firework display , while in the type ii supernovae intensive neutrinos are emitted for a very short period of time followed by an intensive electromagnetic radiation .",
    "supernovae are a very good natural laboratory to study various fundamental issues of physics and astrophysics .",
    "the type ii sn explosion is caused by the mechanism of core collapse .",
    "the total energy release is approximately the gravitational binding energy of the core .",
    "it generates intensive neutrinos which take away about 99% of the total energy .",
    "the explosion itself consumes about 1% of the total energy .",
    "the neutrino emission happens several hours prior to the brightening of the sn which only consumes 0.1% of the total energy .",
    "the observation of the sn neutrinos can serve as an early warning for the optical emission of a type ii sn .",
    "the first observations of the type ii sn were made by kamiokande ii , imb , and baksan in 1987 , with totally 24 neutrino events observed in a short period of about 13 seconds @xcite .",
    "although this number of events is too small for a quantitative study of neutrinos from supernova explosion , they are definitely very valuable for providing the first signal of cosmic neutrinos and initiating astrophysics and particle physics studies of supernova neutrinos .    the daya bay",
    "underground neutrino laboratory has been proposed and r&d is now being carried out .",
    "it is located in south china close to hong kong and provides an excellent site for measuring the neutrino mixing angle @xmath3 by using 4 reactor cores in two clusters , each core with a thermal power of 2.9 gw and therefore 11.6 gw total power .",
    "furthermore , two more cores with an additional thermal power of 5.8 gw are expected to be online in 2011 . since the site is close to a group of hills , the cosmic ray background to the neutrino signals",
    "is vastly reduced .",
    "while the main purpose of the daya bay experiment is to measure a neutrino mixing angle , it can be used to detect possible neutrino events from a sn explosion and serves as a part of the supernovae early warning system ( snews ) @xcite .",
    "hence the theoretical prediction for the detection of sn neutrinos at daya bay is very desirable .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors calculated the expected neutrino events from a type ii sn explosion in borexino . for a typical sn at a distance of 10 kpc a burst of around 110 events would appear in the detector of borexino . in this calculation , matter effects are ignored .",
    "later whisnant and young @xcite considered the detection of type ii sn neutrinos in the daya bay experiment with the matter effect inside the supernova being included .",
    "this leads to the modified results which depend on the flip probability of neutrinos while passing through resonance regions inside a supernova .    in the realistic case",
    ", the neutrinos produced from a sn explosion will likely go through some portion of the earth before reaching the detector .",
    "therefore , in order to give a more accurate prediction for the number of signal events , the earth matter effect should also be taken into account .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to calculate the earth matter effect and therefore takes into account all matter effects , both the earth and supernova , on the detection of type ii sn neutrinos in the daya bay experiment .",
    "during a sn explosion , neutrinos are produced in two bursts . in the first burst which lasts for only a few milliseconds ,",
    "electron neutrinos are generated via the inverse @xmath4-decay process @xmath5 which leads to a neutron rich star . in the second burst which is longer ( @xmath6(10 ) seconds )",
    "neutrinos of all flavors ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 being @xmath10 ) are produced via the @xmath11 annihilation @xmath12 , the electron neutrino antineutrino annihilation @xmath13 , and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung @xmath14 processes . while these neutrinos generated in the sn explosion travel out of the sn",
    ", they interact with the high density core of the sn .",
    "neutrinos @xmath15 decouple first from deep inside the core due to their lesser interactions as they only interact via the neutral current",
    ". then @xmath16 decouples .",
    "the last one to decouple is @xmath17 due to its interaction with the neutron which has a higher density than the proton .",
    "the typical temperatures of these neutrinos are in the following ranges @xcite : t__e=3 - 4  mev , t_|_e= 5 - 6  mev , t__x=7 - 9   mev .",
    "[ 2a ]    for the neutrino of flavor @xmath9 , the time - integrated neutrino energy spectrum can be described by the fermi - dirac distribution , f_^(0)(e)= , [ 2b ] where @xmath18 is the energy of the neutrino and @xmath19 the temperature as given in eq.([2a ] ) , @xmath20 is the total number of the neutrino of flavor @xmath9 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an integer , is defined by f_j = _ 0^dx . [ 2c ] the average neutrino energy is then obtained from the distribution function eq .",
    "( [ 2b ] ) e_^(0 ) = t_. [ 2d ] the total number of the neutrino @xmath7 is n_^(0)=,[2e ] where @xmath23 is the luminosity of @xmath7 .",
    "then the energy spectrum function can be rewritten as f_^(0)(e)=. [ 2f ] in the simplest argument the luminosity of each flavor is the same @xcite .",
    "hence l_^(0)=e_sn^(0 ) , [ 2 g ] where @xmath24 is the total energy released during the sn explosion .",
    "when the sn neutrinos of each flavor are produced they are approximately the effective mass eigenstates due to the extremely high matter density environment .",
    "while they propagate outward to the surface of the sn they could experience level crossing ( neutrinos jump from one mass eigenstate to another ) in the msw resonance regions @xcite .",
    "there are two msw resonance regions which are determined by the two pairs of parameters @xmath25 which is referred to as the high resonance region and @xmath26 the low resonance region , where @xmath27 , i.e. , the mass square difference of the k and j neutrinos , and @xmath28 the corresponding mixing angle .",
    "let us denote the probability that the neutrinos jump from one mass eigenstate to another at the high ( low ) resonance layer by @xmath29 .",
    "the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution of the solar neutrino constrains the flip probability at the low resonance region to be zero ( @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is a function of the mixing angle @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "since the value of the mixing angle @xmath33 is still not determined , in numerical calculation we let @xmath0 vary between 0 and 1 .",
    "the level crossing diagrams are different for normal and inverted mass hierarchies @xcite .",
    "this leads to different forms for neutrino flux of mass engenstates at the surface of sn .",
    "when the neutrinos arrive at the earth after travelling through the cosmic distance all the oscillation factors are averaged out and there is no coherence between different mass eigenstates . hence the neutrino fluxes reaching the earth are the following : for the normal hierarchy ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 and for the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix .    due to the smallness of the mixing angle @xmath3 , we ignore the terms proportional to @xmath31 , then eqs .",

    "( [ 2j ] ) and ( [ 2k ] ) the earth matter effect is neglected . in reality , neutrinos from an sn may likely travel through a significant portion of the earth before reaching the detector and are therefore subject to the matter effect .",
    "the earth matter effect can be parameterized in terms of the distance between the neutrino and the earth center and the total distance travelled in the earth before reaching the detector .",
    "the distance that the neutrino travels in the earth depends on their incident orientation .",
    "suppose a neutrino reaches the detector with the incident angle @xmath42 ( see fig .",
