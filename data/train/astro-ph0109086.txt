    "the m81 group of galaxies is one of the nearest groups to our own .",
    "hence detailed study of the group may impact on many key areas of astronomy , such as structure formation , galaxy evolution , star formation and dark matter .",
    "the present catalogue of group members is the result of several optical surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the group contains one large spiral galaxy ( m81 ) , two peculiar galaxies ( m82 and ngc3077 ) , two small spirals ( ngc2976 , ic2574 ) and a large number of dwarfs .",
    "the core galaxies of the group are strongly interacting : there is a large dynamically complex hi cloud embedding m81 , m82 , ngc3077 and ngc2976 @xcite .",
    "several pointed hi surveys have been undertaken to search for hi in m81 group candidate dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are about 23 dwarf members or candidate members ( 12 dirrs , 9 des , 2 bcds ) .",
    "hi has been unambiguously detected from 9 of the dirrs and from 1 bcd . measured",
    "velocities for m81 group objects lie in the range 140",
    "kms@xmath6 to + 350  kms@xmath6 .",
    "dwarf galaxies are difficult to unambiguously detect in hi within the hi complex around m81 .",
    "elsewhere , hi from group members may be masked by the strong galactic hi emission .    in this paper we present results from the first blind hi survey of the m81 group .",
    "the data for this were taken as part of the hi jodrell all sky survey ( hijass ) which is described in section  2 .",
    "section 3 presents the observational results for the m81 group of galaxies .",
    "section  4 discusses the results and presents our conclusions . a distance to the m81 group of d=3.63  mpc @xcite",
    "is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "hijass is the northern counterpart to the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) @xcite which , when complete , will have surveyed the whole sky up to @xmath7=25 .",
    "hijass will survey the northern sky above this declination to similar sensitivity .",
    "hijass is being undertaken using the multibeam 4-beam cryogenic receiver mounted on the 76-m lovell telescope ( beam fwhm @xmath012.0 ) at jodrell bank .",
    "a 64  mhz bandpass with 1024 channels is used , although local interference restricts the useful velocity range to about 1000  kms@xmath6 to + 10,000  kms@xmath6 .",
    "the survey is conducted by scanning the receiver in declination strips of @xmath08 .",
    "each declination strip is separated by 10 but each area of sky is scanned 8 times , resulting in a final scan separation of 1.25 .",
    "bandpass correction and calibration are applied using the same software as hipass @xcite .",
    "the spectra are gridded into three - dimensional 8@xmath18 data cubes ( @xmath8,@xmath7,@xmath9 ) which have an rms noise level of @xmath016  mjy  beam@xmath6 .",
    "the fwhm velocity resolution is 18.0  kms@xmath6 and the spatial pixel size is 4@xmath14 .    to survey the m81 group we searched the hijass data between @xmath9=@xmath10500  kms@xmath6 in the regions 8@xmath11@xmath12@xmath8@xmath1211@xmath11 , + 70@xmath13@xmath12@xmath7@xmath12 + 78@xmath13 and 9@xmath1103@xmath14@xmath12@xmath8@xmath1210@xmath1136@xmath14 , + 62@xmath13@xmath12@xmath7@xmath12 + 70@xmath13 .",
    "this area ( @xmath0180  sq  deg ) includes the whole of the hi complex around m81 and most of the outer area of the group .",
    "the hijass data was hanning smoothed by 3 channels .",
    "this reduces the velocity resolution to 26  kms@xmath6 but improves the rms noise to @xmath011  mjy  beam@xmath6 .",
    "the relatively high spatial resolution and full spatial sampling of hijass make it more effective at revealing dwarf galaxies within the hi complex around m81 than previous pointed surveys .",

    "the m81 group shows a clear morphology - density relation : des are found in and around the dense core close to m81 , while dirrs are spread over a much larger area .",
    "dwarf galaxies in the local group exhibit a similar relation @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations @xcite suggest that a close tidal interaction of a dirr with a giant galaxy can induce severe mass loss and non - axisymmetric instabilities in the disk of the dirr , turning it into an object which matches the observed properties of a de .",
    "the implication is that dirrs close to the milky way or m31 have been transformed in this way into the des now observed .",
    "those dirrs further away from the giants have not yet undergone a close tidal encounter and remain recognisable as dirrs .",

    "m@xmath3 of hi associated with it , shows signs of recent star formation and has been described as a de / dirr transition object .",
    "we suggest that kar  61 is involved in a tidal interaction with m81 but is at a much earlier stage of tidal stripping than bk5n or kar  64 .",
    "we did not detect any of the des which lie further from m81 than kar  61 , bk5n and kar  64 .",
    "these des may already have had all of their hi stripped by previous tidal encounters .",
    "how have the four known dirrs within the m81 hi complex survived if other dirrs have been tidally stripped and transmuted into des ? at least three of these ( holmberg ix , a952 + 69 , garland ) may actually be tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "the fourth , bk3n , may also be a tidal dwarf galaxy or it may be a dirr currently being tidally stripped . the newly discovered object hijass  j1021 + 6842 may be a further example of a tidal dwarf galaxy in formation , in this case one in which star formation has not yet begun .",
