    "recently , lots of interests have been focused on the @xmath5 process @xcite in the nuclesynthesis because the emitted neutrino flux is expected to be large enough to excite the relevant nuclei in spite of the small cross section due to the weak interaction .",
    "therefore cross sections for the neutrino(antineutrino)-nucleus ( @xmath8 ) scattering with relevant nuclei are to be treated as important input data for a network calculation estimating the nuclear abundances , in specific , for the weak rapid process @xcite .",
    "incident @xmath9 energies exploited in the sn explosion @xcite are focused on the energy range from a few to tens of mev because relevant @xmath9 energy spectra emitted from a proto - neutron star are presumed to be peaked mostly around the energy region by following a fermi - dirac distribution given by temperature ( t ) and chemical potential ( @xmath10 ) @xcite . @xmath11",

    "@xmath13 can be chosen for neutrino types .",
    "therefore , the @xmath14 reactions are usually sensitive on the collective motions of nucleons inside nuclei and proceed via two - step processes , _ i.e. _ the target nuclei are excited by the incident @xmath15 and decayed to the lower energy states with the emission of some particles @xcite .",
    "the excitation occurs through various transitions , _",
    "i.e. _ super allowed fermi ( @xmath16 , allowed gamow teller ( gt ) ( @xmath17 , spin dipole ( @xmath18 , and other higher multipole transitions . therefore dominant contributions of the two - step process stem from discrete and giant resonance ( gr ) states of the compound nucleus .",
    "their typical excitation energy is below tens of mev",
    ". it should be noticed that not only isobaric analogue state ( ias ) and gt transitions but also contributions from higher order multipoles could play important roles in the @xmath19 reaction @xcite .    in the experimental side ,",
    "only a few data measured from accelerated - based @xmath5 facilities , which are deduced mainly from @xmath20 , exist exclusively for the first stage of the two step processes , that is , the formation of compound nuclei .",
    "they have been reported as @xmath5 flux averaged total cross sections in the last decade @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath24 cross section and corresponding neutrino flux . unfortunately , there are no data including the decay processes , that is , the second stage in the two - step process .",
    "neutrino facilities usually used neutrino source from the pion decay at rest ( dar ) and in flight ( dif ) . for the dar neutrino , one obtains continuous spectrum for @xmath25 , which is given as the michel spectrum @xmath26 and different continuous spectrum for @xmath27 @xcite , and mono - energetic @xmath28 fixed as 29.8 mev .",
    "continuous @xmath29 spectrum is obtained from the dif neutrino .",
    "recently , another new method for the production of intense and pure @xmath5 beams has been proposed , called the beta - beam @xcite , which is originally planned to study the cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the concept of the beta - beam is designed by using boosted radioactive ions which can be decayed with emitting neutrinos . for",
    "the study of fundamental interactions and nuclear structure , this new future facility may produce monochromatic @xmath5 beams through the electron capture of radioactive ion beam . of course",
    ", these beams depend on the existence of ions decaying through the electron capture .",
    "it was also suggested how to obtain a mono - energetic @xmath5 beam by using an electron capture process on a nucleus @xcite .",
    "most data are focused on @xmath30c target because the @xmath31c nucleus itself serves as a @xmath9 detector .",
    "data for the inclusive reaction , @xmath31c@xmath32n@xmath33 , show about @xmath34 in the @xmath35 @xmath36 unit including indicated experimental error bars , while data for the exclusive reaction like @xmath31c@xmath32n@xmath37 and @xmath31c@xmath38c ( 15.11 mev ) for the dar neutrino are restricted to @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the same unit , respectively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 scattering data based on accelerator are mainly restricted to the formation of compound nuclei .",
    "but the excited states in compound nuclei subsequently decays into other nuclei with emitting particles such as proton , neutron , alpha , @xmath41 , and so on @xcite . to describe the decay processes at the second stage",
    ", one needs additional calculations for branching ratios into the decay processes like hauser - feshbach ( hf ) statistical model @xcite .",
    "any final state interactions ( fsi ) between outgoing particles and residual nuclei should be also taken into account at this stage .",
    "of course , for the nuclear abundance , both two stages are to be successively considered .    before presenting our results",
    ", we briefly summarize recent theoretical status about @xmath24 scattering with detailed references . since the pioneering work by j. s. cornnell _ et al._@xcite , which exactly predicted the @xmath42c reaction via charged current 20 years ago before the advent of the data , many theoretical calculations@xcite have been done and compared to the experimental data , mainly to the @xmath43 reaction .",
    "conventional approaches for the @xmath44 scattering in the low energy region are shell model ( sm)@xcite , random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite , and quasi - particle rpa ( qrpa)@xcite .    although results of most sm calculations @xcite converge more or less on the experimental data , they inevitably depend on the particle model space , the given hamiltonian , the so called @xmath45 quenching , and so on .",

    "neutron - proton ( np ) pairing as well as proton - proton ( pp ) and neutron - neutron ( nn ) pairing could be important because of the small energy gap due to the neutron excess , although its empirical magnitude is small compared to those of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "moreover the np pairing enables us to consistently describe the cc and nc reactions in a framework , as shown later on .    on the other hand , the continuum rpa ( crpa )",
    "@xcite includes continuum excitation spectrum in the quasi - elastic ( qe ) region in addition to the discrete and gr states , while most of sm , rpa and qrpa do not take explicitly the contribution from the qe region into account .",

    "as shown in fig.7 , contributions from the higher excited states lead to a bit larger value for @xmath229 than the data . similarly to the results by the shell model @xcite , which is a hybrid model _",
    "i.e. _ shell model for gt and ias transition and qrpa model for high multipole transitions , our results reproduced the experimental data by using the same quenching factor as the shell model .",
    "we expect that more fruitful data for the relevant weak transitions , which enables to constraint the ambiguities from the nuclear structure .    for higher multipoles we did not use the quenching factor by following the discussions at ref .",

    "@xcite are obtained for the higher multiople transitions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , 80 % of the data is explained by the gt and ias transition . therefore our results explain systematically the @xmath230fe and @xmath231ni reaction as well as the gt strength in the single @xmath0 decay in a systematically organized qrpa model . for the supernovae application",
    ", we show the cross sections averaged by the sn neutrino spectrum in eq.(1 ) in fig .",
    "8 . cross section via cc are much larger , about 3 times , than those by nc , irrespective of nucleus species .",
    "application to the @xmath5 process for other relevant nuclei are in progress .",
    "we applied the qrpa to the @xmath24 reaction by including multipole transitions up to @xmath232 with explicit momentum dependence and evaluated the @xmath5-reaction to @xmath31c , @xmath207ni and @xmath207fe target .",
    "our results for the @xmath233 reaction show quite consistent results with available experimental data and other theoretical calculations .",
    "remarkable points from our results are summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , not only gt , ias and spin dipole transitions but also other multipole transitions could play roles for @xmath24 reaction via cc below the quasi elastic peak . but",
    "nc reaction is dominated by the gt transition .    secondly ,",
    "np pairing as well as nn and pp pairing correlations act as important ingredients for describing the bcs ground state , and contribute to some extent to the cross section of the @xmath24 reaction . in particular",
    ", it affects the results for medium heavy nuclei such as @xmath207ni and @xmath207fe , which was already expected from our previous results for @xmath234 and 0@xmath235 decays .",
    "finally , for more exact evaluation within a few % for the flux averaged cross section of the future would - be experimental data , more deliberately chosen coulomb correction would be necessary .",
    "in particular , experimental data via nc would be desirable to pin down the ambiguities on the coulomb corrections .",
    "the qrpa is a very efficient method to consider multi - particle and multi - hole interactions and their configuration mixing , which successfully described nuclear reactions sensitive on the nuclear structure , such as @xmath234 and 0@xmath235 decays .",
    "therefore the ambiguities feasible due to the nuclear structure can be pinned down by reproducing the data related to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay .",
    "the extension of our qrpa calculation for @xmath24 reaction to explicitly include the deformation @xcite , which turns out to be so important for the exotic nuclei frequently appeared , is under progress .",
    "it enables us to perform various nuclear weak reactions for stable and unstable nuclei .",
