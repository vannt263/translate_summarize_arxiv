    "( 2000 ) ) identified relativistic radio jets and also a very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray source at the coordinates of the system ; therefore ls  5039 became one of a handful of known gamma - ray binaries .",
    "there are several open issues about the system ( see s11 ) , but the major question is whether the secondary component orbiting around the o6.5v((f ) ) star is a black hole or a non - accreting young pulsar .",
    "hereinafter we show the results of our spectroscopic and photometric analysis concerning mass and orbit constraints of ls  5039 ( see the details in s11 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out in 2009 with the echelle spectrograph mounted at anu 2.3 m telescope ( sso , australia ) , and in 2011 using feros ( ( * ? ? ? * kaufer et al .",
    "1999 ) ) at mpg / eso-2.2 m telescope at la silla , chile .",
    "covering @xmath240 hours with nearly uniform sampling of the whole orbit between 3900 - 6750   with a resolving power @xmath3/@xmath4 23,000 at h@xmath5 , it is the highest resolution , homogeneous spectral dataset ever obtained for ls  5039 .    radial velocities ( rv ) of h    i    and he    i    lines show a systematic blueshift with respect to the rvs of he    ii    lines , therefore only the latter ones were used to fit eclipsing binary models with the wilson ",

    "our data were analyzed as described in s11 but now with the addition of the feros data .",
    "orbital parameters are close to previous solutions ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* casares et al .",
    "2005 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aragona et al . 2009 ) ) , but we found the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath6=0.24 @xmath7 0.08 ) being definitely lower than determined previously .",
    "photometric data , obtained with _ most _ satellite in july of 2009 , indicates a variability at the level of 2 mmag .",
    "our light curve ( lc ) simulations show that the amplitude of lcs decreases with increasing total mass or decreasing eccentricity .",
    "comparison of data and models suggests that primary mass is at the higher end of estimates based on its spectral type ( @xmath226 m@xmath1 ) , from which we get a mass for the compact star of at least 1.8 m@xmath1 .",
    "we carried out a detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis to get mass and orbit constraints of the @xmath0-ray binary ls  5039 .",
    "the new system parameters are close to previously determined ones , except that we found a lower eccentricity .",
    "lc simulations support this result , and imply that the compact object may be a low mass black hole  but do not fully exclude that it may be a neutron star .",
