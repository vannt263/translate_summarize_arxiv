    "later variants of the adaf model allowed for outflows , namely mass loss from the inflowing gas @xcite .",
    "most recently , an improved _ radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) _ model was proposed , involving substantial mass loss ( although the outflowing mass is ignored in calculating the radio emission ) , a non - thermal component of electrons , and different electron and proton temperatures .",

    "we use the term `` temperature '' in our discussion to characterize the typical electron energy even if the electron distribution function happens to be non - maxwellian .",

    "as long as @xmath99 is coherent , we may express this rotation measure in terms of @xmath101 as @xmath102 where we substituted @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath104 , the rotation measure scales as @xmath105 and may be either decreasing or increasing with @xmath20 . in the latter case , the rotation measure is dominated at all frequencies by the same outermost electron shell , while in the former case it is dominated by electrons near the radius where radiation is emitted ( and so it is expected to be larger for higher frequencies or smaller radii ) . the observed rotation measure of @xmath106 at a frequency of @xmath107  hz ( ref . * ? ? ?",

    ". a turbulent magnetic field would generate a random walk in the net rotation measure and so the electron density inferred from the @xmath115 observations would increase by the square - root of the number of field reversals ( coherent @xmath99 patches ) along the region where the @xmath115 originates . the large linear polarization observed at frequencies @xmath116ghz for sgr",

    "the low level of linear polarization at lower frequencies is consistent with the notion that the emission at different frequencies originates from different radii .",
    "for @xmath117 the electrons become mildly relativistic at @xmath118  cm , where the emission is predicted to peak around @xmath74  ghz .",
    "this may account for the circular polarization observed at these low frequencies @xcite .",

    "ii.2 ) the observed @xmath115 excludes a power - law extension of the electron energy distribution , @xmath55 with @xmath63 , down to energies significantly lower than @xmath54 .",

    "a similar time dependence at different frequencies would imply that the rotation measure is dominated by a common outer shell .",
    "the riaf models generically predict that the radio emission is dominated by thermal electrons near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) in the central region of the accretion disk @xcite .",

    "we have pointed out in ",
    "ii.2 that the size measurements indicate that the source size is frequency dependent , implying that the radiation is dominated at different frequencies by electrons at different locations .",
    "this in turn suggests that the observed spectrum reflects the spatial dependence of electron temperature rather than the energy distribution of the electrons at a single radius .",
    "since the emission of radiation in riaf models is dominated by the innermost region of the disk , at @xmath131  cm , the observed size is dominated in these models by foreground interstellar scattering at all frequencies .",
    "the addition of a power - law electron component to these models increases slightly the intrinsic source size @xcite , but does not change the requirement that the measured source size will be dominated at all frequencies by interstellar medium scattering .",
    "these results appear to be at odds with the latest size measurements which indicate that the intrinsic size is resolved well beyond the expected level of interstellar image broadening at @xmath132  mm @xcite and that the intrinsic size is smaller at higher frequencies .    as mentioned in the introduction , existing size measurements are subject to large uncertainties . while our best - fit profiles disfavor existing models , such models can not be ruled out based on current data .",

    "we have shown in   ii.2 that measurements of the spectrum and of the wavelength - dependent size of the radio emission from sgr  a *  indicate that this emission is dominated by optically - thick quasi - thermal plasma , and that the observed spectrum reflects the spatial dependence of the electron temperature ( rather than the energy distribution of electrons at some particular radius ) .",
    "we have derived the electron temperature and magnetic field profiles [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tetb ] ) and  ( [ eq : b ] ) ] , and found that the electron temperature increases above the virial temperature beyond a distance of a few tens of schwarzschild radii from the black hole .",

    "although we have not proposed a dynamical model for the plasma , we have pointed out in ",
    "ii.4 that observations are consistent with an isentropic gas profile and equipartition magnetic field .",
    "our results imply that the radio emitting gas can not be confined to a thin disk and the flow geometry must be geometrically thick .",
    "moreover , the radio - emitting gas is not likely to be inflowing but rather outflowing , since its thermal kinetic energy exceeds the gravitational binding energy beyond a radius of a few tens of schwarzschild radii [ @xmath86 , see table i and eq .  ( [ eq : tbtv ] ) ] .",
    "there may also be a colder accreting component that is sub - dominant in terms of its synchrotron emission .",
    "such a component would likely be confined to a thinner disk geometry that would have only a limited effect on the rotation measure of the radiation emitted by the hot outflowing atmosphere above it .",
    "( however , if the cold component is optically - thick then it would make the image of sgra * asymmetric at a level that would depend on the inclination of the disk .",
    "the resulting frequency dependence of the image centroid location could be constrained by observations . )",
    "an electron temperature profile which does not decline with increasing radius as fast as the virial temperature does , would be consistent with an adiabatic outflow in which the electrons are hotter than the protons because their relativistic temperature declines with decreasing density as @xmath133 with an adiabatic index ( @xmath134 ) that is smaller than that of the protons ( 5/3 ) .",
    "heat conduction could also help to flatten the electron temperature profile @xcite .",
    "the large uncertainty in the inferred source size , reflected by the large uncertainty in the index @xmath5 of the relation @xmath4 , translates to a large uncertainty in the temperature and magnetic field profiles , as implied by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) and  ( [ eq : tetb ] ) .",
    "our preliminary conclusions from existing data differ from current theoretical models @xcite , although not at a statistically robust level .",
    "these potential discrepancies provide added incentive to obtain better data through future observations .",
    "finally , we note that the uncertainty in the determination of the density profiles is related not only to uncertainties in the source size measurements , but also to the lack of simultaneous multi - frequency measurements of the rotation measure (   ii.3 ) .",
    "an accurate determination of the density profile would require therefore not only accurate size measurements , but also simultaneous multi - frequency measurements of the rotation measure .",
    "ultimately , direct imaging of sgr  a *  with a very large baseline array at sub - mm wavelengths @xcite would resolve the accretion flow near the black hole isco and unravel unambiguously the properties of the emitting gas there .",
