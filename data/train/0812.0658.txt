    "the idea of di - neutron correlation can date back to the migdal s paper in 1972@xcite , in which he argued that two neutrons may be bound in finite nuclei even if they are not bound in the vacuum .",
    "this idea was explicitly exploited by hansen and jonson @xcite , where they proposed the di - neutron cluster model and sucessfully analysed the matter radius of @xmath0li .",
    "they also predicted a large coulomb dissociation cross section of the @xmath0li nucleus .",
    "although the di - neutron correlation in the @xmath0li nucleus has been discussed for two decades since the publication of hansen and jonson , it is only recently that a strong indication of its existence has been obtained experimentally in the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0li @xcite .",
    "the new measurement has stimulated lots of theoretical discussions on the di - neutron correlation , not only in the 2@xmath3 halo nuclei , @xmath0li and @xmath4he @xcite , but also in medium - heavy neutron - rich nuclei @xcite as well as in infinite neutron matter @xcite .    in this contribution , we present our recent activities on the di - neutron correlation in light neutron - rich nuclei , forcusing especially on the size of cooper pair in the @xmath0li nucleus .",
    "we also discuss the di - neutron correlation in a 4@xmath3 nucleus , @xmath2he .",
    "@xcite , we have used a three - body model with density - dependent contact interaction @xcite to study the two - neutron cooper pair in @xmath0li at various positions @xmath5 from the center to the surface of the nucleus ( this calculation is essentially equivalent to the particle - particle tamm - dancoff approximation @xcite ) .",
    "we have found that i ) the two - neutron wave function oscillates near the center whereas it becomes similar to that for a bound state around the nuclear surface , and ii ) the local pair coherence length has a well pronounced minimum around the nuclear surface .",
    "this is qualitatively the same behavior as found in neutron matter @xcite , and has subsequently been confirmed in heavier superfluid nuclei as well @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice here that the pairing interaction changes the structure of the cooper pair _ strongly _ and _ qualitatively_. to demonstrate this , we show in fig .",
    "1 the local coherence length of the cooper pair in @xmath0li as a function of the nuclear radius @xmath5 obtained with and without the neutron - neutron ( @xmath6 ) interaction . for the uncorrelated calculations , we consider both the [ ( 1p@xmath7 and [ ( 2s@xmath7 configurations .",
    "one can see that , in the non - interacting case , the cooper pair continuously expands , as it gets farther away from the center of the nucleus .",
    "in marked contrast , in the interacting case it becomes _ smaller _ going from inside to the surface before expanding again into the free space configuration .",
    "this is nothing more than the pronounced strong coupling , _",
    "i.e. , _ the bec - like feature of a cooper pair on the nuclear surface , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also show in the lower panel the local expectation value of the @xmath6-interaction , @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coodinates of the valence neutrons relative to the core nucleus , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the ground state wave function is denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "we see that there is maximal attraction where the the cooper pair is smallest ( @xmath15 3 fm ) .",
    "note that this surface enhancement of the @xmath6 force is _ not _ primarily an effect of the density effect because it also happens with the density independent gogny force@xcite .",
    "it namely is just the other way round : the density dependence of a zero range force is needed to mock up the _ finite _ range of a _ density independent _ force , as is explained in ref .",
    "in fact , the similar compact cooper pair on the nuclear surface has recently been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite using the finite range gogny interaction as well as in an old study with a simple yukawa interaction@xcite .",
    "the dramatic influence of the pairing interaction can be clearly seen also in the two - particle density .",
    "figure 2 shows the two - particle density for the correlated and the uncorrelated [ ( 1p@xmath7 configurations in the total spin @xmath16 channel when the spin - down neutron is located at @xmath17 fm .",
    "as can be seen , in the non - interacting case , the distribution has a symmetric two bump structure with respect to the origin of the nucleus .",
    "this originates from the absence of mixing of wave functions of opposite parity . on the contrary , in the interacting case",
    ", the bump on the far side almost disappears and only the bump on the side of the test particle survives .",
    "this is the essential effect of major shell mixing , which is a clear indication of _ strong pairing correlations _ @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the di - neutron structure in the @xmath2he nucleus .",
    "an important question is how the spatial structure of valence neutrons evolves from that in the 2@xmath3-halo nucleus , @xmath0li , when there are more numbers of neutrons . to address this , we study the @xmath2he nucleus using a core+4@xmath3 five - body model @xcite .",
    "we again use the density - dependent contact pairing interaction among the valence neutrons , and diagonalize the five - body hamiltonian with the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) + particle number projection method .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "3 shows the two - particle density , @xmath18 .",
    "one clearly finds a strong concentration of two - particle density around @xmath19 at around the nuclear surface .",
    "this is similar to what has been found in the borromean nucleus @xmath0li , and clearly indicates the strong di - neutron correlation in this nucleus . since the strong di - neutron structure is apparent for a spin - up and spin - down neutrons , we next plot in the lower panel the four - particle density for the two - dineutron configuration .",
    "the four - particle density for the dineutron - dineutron configuration has a peak around @xmath20 .",
    "this peak arises from the main component of the wave function , that is , the [ ( 1p@xmath21 configuration , for which the four - particle density is proportional to @xmath22 conclusion ----------    we studied the two - neutron wave function in the borromean nucleus @xmath0li by using a three - body model with a density - dependent pairing force , and explored the spatial distribution of the two neutron wave function as a function of the center of mass distance @xmath5 from the core nucleus .",
    "we showed that the relative distance between the two neutrons has a pronounced minimum on the nuclear surface , that is , a _",
    "compact _ bec - like di - neutron structure .",
    "we also studied the di - neutron structure in the @xmath2he nucleus .",
    "we showed that two neutrons with the coupled spin of @xmath23=0 exhibit a strong di - neutron correlation around the surface of this nucleus , whereas the correlation between the two di - neutrons is much weaker .",
