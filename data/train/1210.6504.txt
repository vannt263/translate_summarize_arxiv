    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of magnetic atoms have attracted much attention since their experimental realization with @xmath0cr atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , the creation of condensates of @xmath1dy @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite atoms with much larger magnetic moments than @xmath0cr have also been reported .",
    "furthermore , there has been fast progress towards the condensation of polar molecules with electric dipole moments @xcite , where the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) is even more dominant .",
    "a review of the physics of dipolar bosonic quantum gases has recently been given by lahaye _",
    "the features of the ddi being a non - local long - ranged and anisotropic interaction give rise to a variety of new effects .",
    "one example is the creation of solitary waves , where in analogy to nonlinear optics the effects of dispersion and nonlinearity may cancel each other .",
    "this leads to a condensate with a shape constant in time .",
    "the experimental realization of one - dimensional solitons in self - attractive becs of @xmath3li atoms has been reported @xcite .",
    "_  have theoretically predicted 2d solitons @xcite and kberle _ et al . _",
    "have proposed a realistic experimental setup for the creation of a 2d soliton @xcite .",
    "an exciting aspect of multidimensional solitons is their anisotropic nature , based on the in - plane polarization of the dipoles of such solitons .",
    "2d solitons have already been studied using a variational ansatz with a single gaussian and with coupled gaussian functions @xcite .",
    "_  have recently investigated axially symmetric and vortex solitons on a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to systems with harmonic traps , where the density distribution in the trap direction is an approximate gaussian , systems in an optical lattice will have an exponential density distribution .    the collision of axially symmetric bright 2d solitons has been studied by pedri _",
    "_ @xcite and adhikari _ et al .",
    "investigated a system with dipoles aligned parallel to the harmonic trap , while adhikari _",
    "_ used an optical lattice instead . in both cases ,",
    "the sign of the ddi has to be inverted by fast rotation of the orientation of the dipoles @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction energy becomes @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the angle between the polarization axis and @xmath6 .",
    "the factor @xmath7 can continuously be changed from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "this provides the possibility to change the dipolar interaction from attractive to repulsive .",
    "in addition to the analysis of the collision of 2d solitons , young _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the collision of one - dimensional bright and vortex solitons .",
    "the investigations in @xcite concentrated on the creation and the stability of 2d solitons with respect to small perturbations .",
    "however , one important property of solitons is that their shape is constant in time even when they are moving .",
    "therefore , the collision of two solitons is an adequate scenario for the investigation of soliton dynamics far beyond small excitations .",
    "the influence of the nonlinear contact interaction and the ddi are of particular interest in such calculations .",
    "as mentioned above , the creation of a bec of magnetic atoms has been realized with a variety of species .",
    "our results are valid for all dipolar systems , but we will add the corresponding values for a system with @xmath10 @xmath0cr - atoms per soliton in parentheses .    at sufficiently low temperatures , the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate can be described by the extended gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) which in atomic units and with particle - number scaling @xcite reads    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the scattering length and @xmath13 designates the mean - field wave function .",
    "the dipoles are polarized along the @xmath14-axis , so that @xmath5 is the angle between the @xmath14-axis and the vector @xmath15 .",
    "we choose the @xmath16-direction as the axis of confinement perpendicular to the polarization axis where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 hz ) , while the condensate is free in @xmath19- and @xmath14-direction .",
    "all simulations deal with condensates of low densities , and only a small period of time in which the two condensates merge to one transient condensate with higher density .",
    "this means that we do not need to take a three - body - loss term @xcite into account , as the resulting absorption images ( @xmath20 integrated along the @xmath16-axis ) would only be slightly affected .",
    "we checked this assumption for the calculation of the collision without difference in phase and without angular momentum which up to the time of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 ms ) resulted only in a loss of about @xmath24 of the particles .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , solitons only exist in a certain range of values of the scattering length , which can be tuned by the use of feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "for too large values , the condensate will disperse , while too small values lead to the collapse of the condensate . in the following the scattering length",
    "is chosen to be @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the bohr radius ) .",
    "the main theoretical task for the grid calculations is how to apply the time evolution operator @xmath28 on a state @xmath29 . for this , one splits @xmath30 symmetrically by using the baker - campell - hausdorff formula @xcite    @xmath31    where @xmath32 .",
    "one projects the action of the approximated time evolution operator on the basis of the position operator and makes use of the possibility to insert @xmath33 :    @xmath34    the structure of suggests the following algorithmic procedure :    * fourier transform of @xmath35 in order to obtain @xmath36 * multiply by @xmath37 * inverse fourier transform to real space * multiply by @xmath38 * fourier transform to momentum space * multiply by @xmath37 * inverse fourier transform to real space    the potential @xmath39 consists of the harmonic potential , the scattering potential and the ddi potential .",
    "the scattering potential and the ddi potential have to be calculated at each time step .",
    "the latter can be evaluated by means of the convolution theorem , which results in two more fourier transforms :    @xmath40    here @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the momentum and the momentum in @xmath14-direction , respectively .",
    "altogether , we have to perform six fourier transforms for each time step .",
    "note that the first and last fourier transforms described in the algorithmic procedure of the time evolution are only necessary if one is interested in physical quantities whose evaluation requires the wave function in real space .    for the simulations ,",
    "the spatial domain was discretized with up to @xmath43 grid points . since",
    "this scheme is numerically very demanding , it has been implemented for graphics processing units ( gpus ) using cuda , enabling a very high degree of parallelization . using the tesla c2070 improves the performance of our algorithm by a factor of about 80 for double precision in comparison to the corresponding c algorithm using the well known fftw library for computing the discrete fourier transform on a ibm system x3400 with a quad - core intel xeon processor e5430 ( 2.66ghz 12 mb l2 1333mhz 80w ) and 4 x 4 gb pc2 - 5300 cl5 ecc ddr2 chipkill low power fbdimm 667mhz .    to investigate the coherent collision of solitons we have applied the following procedure .",
    "the first step is the computation of the ground state of one condensate using the split - operator method with imaginary time evolution ( @xmath44 . afterwards we double the size of the grid in the @xmath19-direction and place two solitons in the repelling side - by - side configuration .",
    "the distance between the condensates is chosen such that they do not feel the mutual dipole - dipole interaction . to introduce momentum in the system ,",
    "we multiply the left hand - side of the wave function by a plane wave @xmath45 ( for the soliton moving to the right ) and the right hand - side by @xmath46 ( for the soliton moving to the left ) , respectively .",
    "variational calculations using coupled gaussian wave packets ( gwps ) have shown to be a full - fledged alternative to numerical grid calculations for the calculation of ground states of dipolar becs @xcite .",
    "the applicability of such ansatzes to dynamical simulations is a challenging task .",
    "the decisive extension of the previous work @xcite is that additional translational and rotational degrees of freedom are included in the ansatz with coupled gwps to describe the dynamics of the condensate wave function . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we shortly review the time - dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) in this section , and subsequently apply it to the ansatz of coupled gwps .",
    "we make use of the tdvp in the formulation of mclachlan @xcite where @xmath47 is varied such that @xmath48 and set @xmath49 afterwards .",

    "it is one of the most important advantages of the method that nearly all of these integrals can be calculated analytically .",
    "however , the dipolar integral @xmath74 can only be calculated analytically for gwps centered in the origin without the additional translational degrees of freedom introduced in the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz_tdvp_eom ] ) .",
    "the analytical and numerical treatment of the dipolar integral is presented in appendix  [ sec : vari - solut - dipol ] .",
    "the procedure for the calculations is as follows : at first the equations of motion ( [ eq : var_eom ] ) for one soliton are integrated in imaginary time , with the wave function being normalized after every time step .",
    "afterwards every gwp of the wave function is copied and the resulting two solitons are positioned in the same way as given in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical approach ] .",

    "constructive interference occurs and the condensates merge and split up in two solitons again .",
    "note that the condensates after the split - up ( @xmath76 , @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 ms ) have a larger spatial distribution than before ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this indicates that the transfer of kinetic energy to internal energy has excited the solitons .",

    "the column in the middle shows a simulation with a difference of @xmath78 in phase , resulting in a collision where the soliton on the right eventually has a lower amplitude than the one on the left , so that we do not have symmetric behavior anymore .",

    "the transfer of kinetic energy into internal energy is once again smaller , corresponding to a just slightly larger condensate at @xmath76 .",
    "the occurrence of the broken symmetry in @xmath19-direction can be understood if one considers that a difference in phase of @xmath79 and @xmath80 yields a wave function which is an eigenfunction of the parity operator , in the sense of @xmath81 .",

    "it is remarkable that a total number of only six gwps is sufficient to reproduce the structures of the grid calculations and give the correct result for the configuration at the end of all three simulations . the first case without a difference in phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collision_angmom_all]a ) once again leads the solitons to merge and split up afterwards , while a transient eddy - like structure appears in the course of the collision . as in the case with no angular momentum ,",
    "the solitons either seem to disperse , or a breathing - mode - like oscillation has been excited .",
    "the amount of kinetic energy which has been transferred is lower than in the former case , leading to condensates with smaller extension at @xmath76 than their corresponding condensates in the simulation presented above .",

    "the oscillatory behavior indicates the excitation of the solitons .",

    "[ fig : energy_kinetic ] with the absorption images in fig .",
    "[ fig : collision_angmom_all ] , it is obvious that a larger transfer of kinetic energy implies a larger condensate at @xmath76 .",
    "the slightly smaller transfer observed at the end of the full - numerical calculations ( this leads to a larger extension of the solitons after the collision c.f .",
    "[ fig : collision_angmom_all ] ) originates from finite grid sizes and thus has no physical meaning .",
    "variational calculations show an oscillation of the kinetic energy for large timescales , which corresponds to the excitation of the solitons .",
    "the amount of kinetic energy transferred into internal energy of the solitons depends on the overlap of the wave functions during the collision process .",
    "a large overlap of the solitons enhances the nonlinear coupling in the gpe as @xmath93 increases and a small one diminishes the coupling .",
    "this can be seen best in fig .",
    "[ fig : results_10 ] ( right column ) where the destructive interference for the calculation with phase difference @xmath80 leads to @xmath94 . for the corresponding calculation with nonzero angular momentum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collision_angmom_all]c ) we find @xmath94 , too .",
    "however , the ring - like structure increases the overlap during the collision .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] the variance @xmath95 with @xmath96 is plotted as a function of time .",
    "the variance has been calculated for the three gwps representing the solitons on the left - hand side in the starting configuration and for the gwp which has the largest amplitude after the collision process .",
    "this dominant gwp @xmath92 shows oscillatory behavior while the other gwps with much smaller amplitudes describe particles leaving the soliton .",
    "this effect can hardly be seen in the absorption images in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] .",
    "however , the absorption images show that a soliton still exists , although this would be difficult to see in an actual experiment due to the very long time scale .",
    "we have also performed simulations with smaller and larger momenta of the solitons .",
    "the former case leads to one merged condensate which does not split up again after the collision but shows oscillatory behavior .",
    "this is very similar to the collision presented in @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the wavelength of the interference pattern is smaller and becomes more pronounced .",
    "note that grid calculations with high momenta are problematic , because the condensates quickly reach the edge of the grid .",
    "an approach with a variational ansatz is better suited to analyze these scenarios .",
    "we have studied the collisions of anisotropic two - dimensional bright solitons in dipolar bose - einstein condensates both with a fully - numerical ansatz and a time - dependent variational principle with coupled gaussians .",
    "the calculations presented show that the collision process leads to an energy transfer from kinetic energy to `` inner '' energy of the solitons which leads to excited solitons with larger extent .",
    "the absorption images show very good qualitative agreement of the results gained by the two different methods .",
    "the advantages of the grid calculations are the simplicity of the numerical scheme ( although the implementation for the massively parallel computation requires some effort ) , the freedom in describing all different shapes of wave functions , and the numerical stability of the method .",
    "the advantages of the variational calculations are the much smaller numerical effort , enabling one to run long calculations on standard pcs , the independence of finite grid size , and the small amount of parameters to be saved .",
    "both methods can be used to simulate the time - dependent gpe , supporting each other mutually .",
    "one further application would be the inclusion of additional external potentials such as optical lattices and the comparison of the methods in such scenarios .",
    "our results should stimulate experimental efforts to study the collisions of 2d anisotropic solitons .",
