    "many astronomical observations indicate that most of the matter in our universe is dark ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the evidences come mainly from the gravitational effects of the dark matter ( dm ) , such as the rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite , the gravitational lensing @xcite and the dynamics of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the studies such as primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite show that the dm is mostly non - baryonic . combining recent cosmological measurements , for example from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )",
    ", one could deduce precisely the relic density of dm , namely @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of dark matter is still unclear . in the literature",
    "there is a `` zoo '' of particle candidates for dm @xcite , among which the most popular candidate at present is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) such as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) @xmath4 .",
    "search for wimp in particle physics experiments is very important to pin down the properties of the dm . besides searching missing energy signals at accelerator - based experiments ,",
    "there are usually two classes of methods to detect wimp , namely direct and indirect ones .",
    "the former method detects wimp by measuring the recoil of heavy nucleus in the detector and gives the most strong evidence for the existence of dm .",
    "the latter one detects the dm self - annihilation signals , which include neutrinos , photons , anti - matter particles and so on . among them",
    "neutrinos are one of the most attractive signals . for the _ low energy _ neutrinos ( say much less than 100 gev ) , their interactions with matter are highly suppressed by a factor at least @xmath5 with @xmath6 the typical energy scale of the interaction .",
    "the neutrinos are hardly energy loss and trajectory deflection during their propagation , therefore they may carry the information of the nature and distribution of the dm . however due to the same reason , it is hard to capture such kind of _ low energy _ and relatively low flux neutrinos .",
    "for the _ high energy _",
    "neutrinos ( say around 100 gev or higher ) , the interactions among neutrinos and matter become much stronger .",
    "these neutrinos may keep the information of the dm , and it is relatively easy to observe them experimentally .",
    "one proposal of detecting the high energy neutrino signals is to explore the locations close to us such as the center of the sun or the earth to get enough neutrino flux .",
    "the dm particles are gravitational trapped in the center of the sun or earth and produce neutrinos by annihilation @xcite . if the annihilation and capture processes are in equilibrium , the neutrino flux are mainly determined by the cross section of the dm and nuclei .",
    "another proposal is to detect the neutrino signals from dm annihilation in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "though the sources in the mw are farther than the sun , it is natural to expect that the larger amount of dm can compensate the distance .",
    "moreover the neutrino flux depends on the dm annihilation rate and number density square , therefore the regions with high density in the mw , such as the galactic center ( gc ) or sub - halos , should be potentially excellent observational targets .",
    "the gc is conventionally thought to be source - rich astrophysical laboratory and has attracted many attention of astronomers .",
    "it is also true for the dm indirect searches . due to the weak interaction of dm particles , the dm density at the gc",
    "is highly accumulated as shown by detail simulations , which makes the gc a bright source of dm annihilation .",
    "however , the complicated astrophysical environment and various kinds of astrophysical sources make the gc a high background site .",
    "in addition , the overlapping with bayonic matter objects ( e.g. , the central massive black hole @xcite ) may also affect the dm distribution and increase the uncertainties .",
    "it should be emphasized that the galactic sub - halos may be good candidates as dm sources .",
    "since the self - annihilation of dm is square - dependent on the number density , the clump of substructure is expected to effectively enhance the annihilation signal and plays a role of the so - called `` boost factor '' @xcite .",
    "furthermore as indicated by simulations , the spatial distribution of dm sub - halos is tend to be spherical symmetric in the mw halo , which may locate at a low - background site and effectively avoid the source confusion in the galactic plane .",
    "the effects of dm sub - halos on the flux of induced neutrino is what we try to investigate in this work .",
    "the neutrinos detected by high - energy neutrino telescopes such as super - kamikande @xcite , amanda @xcite etc . are thought to be mainly from atmospheric neutrinos . here",
    "they originate from the decay of hadrons which are produced by the strong interactions of cosmic rays with atmosphere .",
    "experimentally no obvious excess has yet been observed .",
    "then the measurements on neutrino flux can be utilized to set bounds on the dm annihilation cross section .",
    "as neutrinos are the most difficult to detect in the dm annihilating final states , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite assumed that the dm annihilate solely into neutrinos .",
    "they calculated the extra - galactic and the galactic neutrino fluxes , compared them with atmospheric neutrino flux , and set an upper bound on the dm annihilation cross section @xmath7 .",
    "however , the dm may annihilate into final states other than neutrinos . in most of the dm models",
    "there are several annihilation channels .",
    "moreover high energy neutrinos from the dm annihilation will lead to gauge bosons bremsstrahlung @xcite even in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the electromagnetic final states through higher - order corrections are also inevitable @xcite .",
    "therefore the assumption that dm annihilate into only neutrinos gives the most conservative bound on dm annihilation cross section .    in this paper",
    "we calculated the neutrino flux from the dm annihilations in the mw including the contributions from sub - halos by assuming that the dm annihilate into neutrinos only @xcite . by comparing the predicted flux with the available atmospheric neutrino measurements",
    ", we set a very strict constraint on the dm total annihilation cross section .",
    "compared to the previous studies , in this work we utilize the angular resolution of the neutrino telescope to derive the stricter constraints . here",
    "the massive sub - halos can be treated as the point - like sources . based on our analysis",
    "we may observe the high energy neutrino flux provided that precise angular resolution data from antares @xcite and icecube @xcite is available .",
    "on the other hand if no excess flux out of atmospheric neutrino is observed , an improved upper - bound of the annihilation cross section and/or the exclusion of certain sub - halo models can be obtained .",

    "ii , we describe the sub - halo models according to the n - body simulation results . in sec .",

    "for the moderate case b01+nfw , we find the upper bound of @xmath137 is about @xmath142 @xmath125 s@xmath126 .",
    "while for the concentration model b01-subhalo , the bound can reach @xmath143 @xmath125 s@xmath126 , which is even lower than @xmath7 for the natural scale which can induce the correct relic density of dm .",
    "it should be noted that dm can annihilate into final states other than neutrinos .",
    "thus the assumption that dm annihilates into only neutrinos gives the most conservative bound on the dm annihilation cross section and is independent of the particle properties of dm particle .",
    "neutrinos are thought to be an important complementary particles for dm indirect searches besides @xmath72-rays and charged anti - particles .",
    "it is shown that the detectability of @xmath72-rays from dm sub - halos on glast is optimistic @xcite .",
    "the effects of subhalos on positrons @xcite and antiprotons @xcite are also investigated . the combination and",
    "cross check of different kinds of signals will be very crucial to identify the dm sources and investigate the properties of dm particles .",

    "<S> current measurements on neutrino flux is consistent with theoretical prediction of atmospheric neutrino within the uncertainties . in this paper , by requiring that the dm annihilation neutrino flux is less than the current measurements , we obtain an upper bound on the cross section of dark matter annihilation @xmath0 . </S>",
