    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point like x - ray sources situated external to the nucleus of their host galaxy , which have inferred x - ray luminosities in excess of 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "although , first observed @xmath530 years ago by _ einstein _",
    "( fabbiano 1989 ) , these sources are yet to be fully understood , with the only certainty being that they can not all be explained by stellar - mass black holes ( with masses 320 @xmath3 ) radiating isotropically below their eddington limit .",
    "the simplest way to circumvent this issue is to assume that larger compact objects reside within these systems , an approach that would provide us with objects intermediate in mass ( imbh , of mass @xmath510010,000 @xmath3 ; colbert & mushotsky 1999 ) , as well as luminosity , between those of their stellar - mass and super - massive black hole cousins .",
    "this idea is appealing as it can provide a ` missing link ' in the mass scale of these objects and would have significant implications on our understanding of the formation and evolution of both black holes and galaxies ( e.g. madau and rees 2001 ; ebisuzaki et al .",
    "evidence supporting this scenario was presented in 2003 by miller et al .",
    "in which the spectra of ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 were fitted with a standard canonical accretion disc plus power - law continuum model for accreting black hole x - ray binary systems .",
    "this resulted in a remarkably cool disc temperature of kt@xmath6150 ev , that implies a black hole mass of @xmath7 @xmath3 .",
    "similar results were found for other sources ( e.g. miller et al 2004a & 2004b ) .",
    "however recent studies , such as stobbart , roberts & wilms ( 2006 ) , gonalves & soria ( 2006 ) , vierdayanti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and feng & kaaret ( 2007 ) have demonstrated that the spectra of ulxs can be equally well explained by models that infer a stellar - mass black hole ( perhaps up to 100 @xmath3 ) accreting at extreme rates to be powering the system .    to date ,",
    "x - ray spectral analysis has been unable to uniquely determine the nature of ulxs .",
    "one option is to turn to a broader bandpass in an attempt to find counterparts to these sources .",
    "alternatively , others have chosen to carry out x - ray variability studies on these highly luminous systems , to compare to the known variability characteristics of stellar - mass sources and agn on both short and long timescales .",
    "the analysis of temporal variability for both stellar and super - massive black holes via power spectral densities ( psd ) has shown a scaling by mass and accretion rates of the psd break time - scales ( e.g. mchardy et al 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately very few ulxs show much variability power , but some measurements have been made , for example soria et al ( 2004 ) detected a break at 2.5 mhz in the psd of ngc 5408 x-1 , which indicated a mass of @xmath5100 @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , intra - observational studies have revealed that only @xmath815% of ulxs exhibit measurable short - term variability ( swartz et al 2004 ; feng & kaaret 2005 ) .",
    "when extending variability studies to longer timescales problems arise because few sources have been regularly observed .",
    "unlike their galactic stellar - mass counterparts or the brighter quasars , which can be monitored daily by instruments such as the all sky monitor on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ , analysis can only be carried out using pointed observations .",
    "this leads to large gaps in the light curves , making it difficult to track the trends of these systems .",
    "however , findings to date show that ulxs tend to be persistent over timescales of @xmath910 years ( e.g. roberts et al .",
    "one avenue that remains under - explored is that of spectral variability .",
    "these studies suffer from the same windowing issues discussed above , making it difficult to observe spectral evolution in detail .",
    "some studies have been performed , such as the investigation into the x - ray source population of the antennae performed by fabbiano et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "this , along with other studies , found that the majority of ulxs display a general hardening as the luminosity of the system increases ( e.g. homberg ii x-1 , dewangan et al . in 2004 ; ngc 5204 x-1 , roberts et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in 2002 , roberts et al . published results from a 20 ks _",
    "acis - s observation of the interacting galaxy pair ngc  4485 and ngc 4490 ( this paper is referred to hereafter as rwwm02 ) .",
    "these galaxies reside at a distance @xmath57.8 mpc , placing these amongst the very nearest interacting pairs of late type galaxies .",
    "initially their work entailed a study of the general x - ray emission from the pair , considering the emission from both diffuse and discrete sources .",
    "a total of 29 discrete sources were found to be coincident with ngc 4490 and one with ngc 4485 , with luminosities ranging from @xmath52x10@xmath10 to 4x10@xmath4erg s@xmath2 .",
    "of these , six were identified as emitting at ultraluminous rates , a number greatly in excess of the average of @xmath11 1 per galaxy ( liu , bregman & irwin 2006 ) , and a population of ulxs only bettered numerically by m51 and m82 within 10 mpc . here",
    "we revisit the data presented within rwwm02 , combining this with information from subsequent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations in order to better explore the behaviour of these ulxs on both short and long timescales .",
    "the ngc 4485/4490 galaxy pair has been observed by _",
    "chandra _ on three occasions , the first of which was reported in rwwm02 , with two subsequent deeper observations taken during 2004 .",
    "a search of the _ xmm - newton _ archive revealed one further observation taken in 2002 .",
    "details of these observations can be seen in table [ tab : telescope ] .",
    "( for simplicity , the observations will be labelled as shown in this table throughout the rest of this paper . )",

    "cxou j123038.3 + 413830 is the new transient source , not previously observed as a ulx , that appears only in the most recent observation .",
    "we embolden the @xmath12/degrees of freedom ( dof ) for the best fitting model for each source observation .",

    "@xmath17 disc temperature in kev .",
    "@xmath18 the best fitting models to this data gave a reduced @xmath12 greater than 2 , therefore we did not place constraints on the parameter errors .",
    "[ tab : param ]    the simple absorbed single component models as shown in table  [ tab : param ] provide acceptable fits to the majority of the data ( model rejection probabilities , based on the @xmath0 fit , of @xmath19 ) .",
    "only three best - fits were statistically poor models of the data ; both the latter _ chandra _ observations of cxou j123029.5 + 413927 ( with rejection probabilities of @xmath20 ) , and a very marginal rejection of the best fit to cxou j123032.3 + 413918 in observation c3 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we show examples of the spectral quality of our data in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , where data for two of the ulxs is shown over all four observation epochs . clearly , the spectra and luminosity of the ulxs vary with time .",
    "we discuss this spectral variability further below .",
    "the best - fitting parameters to the models are in the range @xmath22 for the pl model , and @xmath23 kev for the mcdbb model .",
    "as these two models are also commonly used to describe galactic black holes , it is worth considering the comparative fits gained , although caution should be taken when doing this as the different band pass of _ chandra _ to those instruments generally used to study galactic black holes may be a contributory factor in differing results ( see section [ subsection : spectra ] for further discussion ) .",
    "here we find that the observed values for pl photon index are in most cases a little on the low side for the steep power - law state ( a.k.a . very high state ) as described by mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) , which is defined by a @xmath24 power - law continuum , and in many cases are similar to the @xmath25 slopes seen in the hard state .",
    "however , this range of power - law slopes is very typical for _ chandra _ observations of ulxs ( swartz et al .",
    "2004 , berghea et al .",
    "2008 ) . in a similar vein ,",
    "the mcdbb inner disc temperatures are generally a little high compared to galactic black holes in the thermal - dominated ( high / soft ) state which generally possess disc temperatures @xmath26 kev ( although higher temperatures have been seen , particularly in the steep power - law state cf .",
    "mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .",
    "they are however very similar to those measured in other ulxs modelled by a mcdbb ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "the range of spectral properties therefore appear typical of the ulx class in general . )",
    "match very closely .",
    "however , there is a trend for our new absorption values to be @xmath27 higher ( although in many cases there is reasonable agreement with the previous measurements within the errors ) .",
    "this difference is likely attributable to a combination of considering data below 0.5 kev - which rwwm02 did not - and the improvements in calibration made over the intervening years . ]",
    "as the previous section shows , we have multiple detections of the ulxs in the ngc 4485/4490 system , each with sufficient data quality to examine their individual x - ray spectra .",
    "this therefore provides an excellent dataset with which to begin to examine the variation in the x - ray spectra of these ulxs over time , as amply demonstrated in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "in particular , five ulxs have a complete set of spectral fits , i.e. an acceptable - or only marginally rejected - best - fitting spectrum in each epoch , which we base this analysis on .",
    "we do not discuss either the new transient ulx cxou j123038.3 + 413830 ( with only one spectral dataset ) , or the candidate snr cxou j123029.5 + 413927 , in the following work .    a first interesting trend to consider is which models provide a best fit to the data .",
    "initially we consider the best fitting model to be that with the lowest @xmath28@xmath29/dof ( although in some instances @xmath30@xmath28@xmath29 between the models is marginal ) . on the whole",
    ", these ulxs are more frequently better fit by the mcdbb model than the pl model ( 12/20 datasets ) .",
    "one source is consistently best fitted by each model ; cxou j123030.8 + 413911 is always better fitted by the pl model , whereas cxou j123043.2 + 413818 is better fitted by the mcdbb in the four observations .",
    "the other three can all be best fitted by both models in one or more observations",
    ". however , one trend appears in these three sources ; _ the pl provides the better fits exclusively at lower observed luminosity _ , _ whereas the mcdbb fits to the higher luminosity data_. an obvious interpretation of this change in spectral shape is that it could be an indication for a spectral state transition .",
    "given the potential importance of this result , we have investigated it further .",
    "as so few of the spectral fits were rejected on the basis of the @xmath0 statistic , the vast majority of fits constitute acceptable interpretations of the data so we could not simply use the @xmath0 statistic to distinguish models .",
    "instead , we turn to bayesian information criterion analysis ( jefferys 1961 ; schwarz 1978 ) .",
    "this provides a measure of whether one model should be considered a superior description of the data , when compared to another .",
    "we calculate values in the range @xmath31 for the majority of our comparisons between models for the same epoch data .",
    "this is substantially lower than a value of 2 , considered a positive result by the bayesian information criterion ( i.e. evidence that one model is superior to the other ) ( cf .",
    "kass & raftery 1995 ) .",
    "hence we can not distinguish which model provides a statistically superior fit to each dataset , so claims that one model clearly provides a better fit than the other can not be made on the basis of our data .    despite the lack of a strong distinction between the two models in most sources , we do find that the parameterisations of these models vary between observations .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected , given that it is a trend observed in other ulxs ( e.g. ngc 2403 source 3 , isobe et al .",
    "we have investigated this in figure  [ fig : specvar ] , where we plot the derived parameters for each model ( the power - law photon index @xmath32 , and the inner accretion disc temperature @xmath33 , as listed in table  [ tab : param ] ) against the 0.58 kev luminosity of the source derived from that model .",
    "we show this for both the observed luminosity , and for an intrinsic luminosity calculated in the same band by simply setting the absorption acting on the model to zero . in each plot",
    "we show the data points for which that model is the better fitting by solid error lines , and use dashed errors for the worse fitting model . each separate ulx is distinguished via individual colours and symbols",
    "( see the figure caption for a key ) .",
    "the figure is plotted showing @xmath34 errors on the source parameters ; clearly there are statistically significant changes in luminosity and/or parameterisation for each source over the course of our observations .",
    "what is immediately obvious from comparing the two pairs of panels in figure  [ fig : specvar ] is that the models react rather differently to the removal of an absorption column .",
    "the removal of an absorption column for the mcdbb model leads to little movement in the relative positions of the data points , only a general movement to higher luminosities ( with the latter as would be expected from correcting to an intrinsic luminosity ) .",
    "however , the power - law continuum data points react rather more dramatically , with the data with softer intrinsic slopes ( higher values of @xmath32 ) having a much larger apparent correction from observed to intrinsic luminosity than those data with harder slopes .",
    "this is rather well - demonstrated by the data for cxou j123030.8 + 413911 ( red squares , the only source always best - fitted by the power - law model ) , which appears to vary its spectral slope with little or no contemporaneous change in observed luminosity ; however when the correction is made for the modelled absorption , it show a clear trend of becoming softer as its luminosity increases .",
    "a pertinent question is therefore whether this latter relationship is a physically correct interpretation of the data , or whether this is some sort of artefact of the fitting process .",
    "we have examined this question by plotting the best fitting values of the power - law photon index @xmath32 against the fitted absorption column density @xmath35 in figure  [ fig : nh_vs_gamma ] .",
    "if there were no relation between the two one would see a simple scatter plot , with the column independent of the power - law slope .",
    "however , at least in the case of cxou j123030.8 + 413911 , the measured column density is clearly increasing concurrently with @xmath32 .",
    "this suggests that one of two scenarios is occuring : either there is a physically real increase in absorbing column , local to the ulx , that occurs simultaneously with a steepening of the spectral slope and increase in intrinsic luminosity ; or that the spectral fitting process is artificially inferring higher columns that go hand - in - hand with steeper slopes in some observations .",
    "the latter is not so far - fetched ; as the column is inferred from the low - energy turn - over of the power - law spectrum , one might expect some degeneracy between the slope being turned over and the amount of material required to produce the turn - over , particularly within the limited band - pass of the _ chandra _ data where we see few data points above 5 kev to really constrain the slope of the power - law tail ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the other four sources all behave somewhat differently to cxou j123030.8 + 413911 .",
    "two sources - cxou j123030.6 + 414142 and cxou j123043.2 + 413818 , plotted in figures  [ fig : specvar ] & [ fig : nh_vs_gamma ] as green triangles and blue stars respectively - appear to consistently harden their spectra as their luminosity increases .",
    "interestingly these two sources are predominantly better fit by a mcdbb model ( albeit with the caveats discussed above about distinguishing the models ) , and we note that this behaviour is quite consistent with accretion discs becoming hotter as their luminosity increases , as is seen in galactic black hole x - ray binaries , e.g. done , gierliski & kubota ( 2007 ) . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the behaviour of the remaining two sources is less clear cut .",
    "cxou j123032.3 + 413918 ( plotted as black circles ) is mainly better fit by a mcdbb model ; in this model it appears not to vary substantially ( less than @xmath36 , with large errors ) in luminosity or disc temperature , but when better fit by a power - law model it appears slightly harder in spectrum ( although again with large errors ) .",
    "cxou j123036.3 + 413837 behaves similarly - again it appears harder in the power - law state than when it possesses a mcdbb - dominated spectrum , although in this case there is a wider difference in the parameters of the data points for the mcdbb spectrum .",
    "interestingly , though , these two disc - dominated spectra appear to follow the same more luminous / harder trend as cxou j123030.6 + 414142 and cxou j123043.2 + 413818 .",
    "so , although we are unable to strictly distinguish which model provides the preferable fit to the data , it does appear as though those sources slightly better fitted by a mcdbb model are behaving in a fashion consistent with that expected of sources dominated by an accretion disc .",
    "we discuss this interesting result further in the next section .      following the method of rwwm02 , light curves for each source observation were binned to @xmath525 and @xmath5100 counts per bin to allow simple tests on variability to be carried out .",
    "initially these tests were performed by fitting the background - subtracted light curves to a constant flux ( the average for that observation ) then examining the fit with a @xmath28@xmath29 test .",
    "it was necessary to cut the ( co - added pn and mos ) light curves in two to remove a large flaring event from the observation , therefore the _ xmm - newton _ data initially provides two light curves for each source . as a further test",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ light curves were reassembled ( excluding the flaring event ) and the light curves were re - tested .",
    "a separate test on the light curves was carried out by investigating the excess variance of each dataset .",
    "however , no statistical signs of short - term variability were detected by any test in any light curve .",
    "we note that none of the seven ulxs we have in common with the work of fridriksson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed short - term variability in their analysis either , when tested using a one - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "fridriksson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) examine the long - term variability of the ulxs in ngc 4485/4490 , and detect significant flux variability in all but one of the ulxs ( that one being cxou j123030.8 + 413911 ) . here",
    "we also derive long - term light curves , albeit using generally more conservative techniques , which we present in figures  [ fig : long term lc ] and [ fig : src_b lc ] .",
    "we expand on the long - term lightcurves presented in rwwm02 ( based on _ rosat _ data , and _",
    "data from observation c1 alone ) , which we limit to the 0.5 - 2 kev band as this is the only band in common for all the instruments .",
    "the luminosities we quote are therefore generally lower than seen elsewhere .",
    "we also include limits where sources are undetected ( calculated as per rwwm02 ) . finally , we display the 1@xmath37 errors for the luminosities derived from spectral modelling of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data ( the errors on the _ rosat _ data are more standard counting errors , due to the lack of spectral information in this data ) .    long - term light curves for the six previously - known ulxs are shown in figure  [ fig : long term lc ] , which is a simple extension of figure 5 in rwwm02 .",
    "the light curve for the new transient ulx ( cxou j123038.3 + 413830 ) is in figure   [ fig : src_b lc ] , and shows it would have been clearly detectable in earlier _ rosat _ pspc , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data . of the other ulxs , cxou j123030.8",
    "+ 413911 was itself deemed a transient in rwwm02 due to its non - detection by _ rosat _ ; however it has apparently remained in outburst at roughly the same flux level in observations spanning @xmath38 yrs after its discovery .",
    "the flux of cxou j123043.2 + 413818 has remained similarly stable , though this is over a longer @xmath39 yr timescale . at first glance",
    "this may appear to contrast with the findings of fridriksson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , but this difference is predominantly due to bandpass selection .",
    "they note significant variations in hard colour that by their definition covers the 17 kev band ; we however consider the 0.52.0 kev band common to all instruments contributing data .",
    "to further test our result , we apply the same significance parameter ( _ s_@xmath40 ) used by the authors .",
    "they define a source as variable if _ s_@xmath40 @xmath41 3 .",
    "we find that _",
    "s_@xmath40 @xmath42 1.3 for cxou j123043.2 + 413818 , confirming the lack of variability .",
    "the three other brighter ulxs have displayed higher variability amplitudes over the @xmath39 yrs covered by the observations , though have remained detectable throughout this time ( cxou j123030.6 + 414152 , _",
    "s_@xmath40 @xmath42 6.2 ; cxou j123032.3 + 413918 , _",

    "s_@xmath40 @xmath42 12.2 ) .",
    "we discuss the remaining source ( cxou j123029.5 + 413927 ) below in section 4.2 .",
    "in the previous section we have considered the properties of the ulxs separately . we show that most are adequately fitted by two simple spectral models ( a power - law continuum or a mcdbb ) .",
    "although there are apparent trends ( based on a superior @xmath0 fit ) in the best fitting model to the data with the luminosity of the ulx at a given epoch , we show that statistically we can not distinguish a best fitting model on this basis alone .",
    "interestingly , though , the best fitting parameters do give some support to the initial distinction based on the @xmath0 fit - those models better fitted by a mcdbb do appear to behave in a way consistent with this ( increasing in disc temperature as their luminosity increases ) .",
    "no temporal variability is evident on short ( intra - observation ) timescales for any source contained within ngc 4485/4490 .",
    "however , strong variability is seen over longer ( @xmath5 years ) time scales in most of the ulxs .",
    "when we consider the spectral and temporal behaviour of the ulxs together , we find that these ulxs appear rather heterogeneous , an unsurprising result given previous multi - epoch observations ( e.g. fabbiano et al . 2003a , roberts et al .",
    "2004 , zezas 2007 ) .",
    "we initially consider only the five sources discussed in section [ subsection : spectral_var ] , examining both the long - term light curves and spectral variability of each source to see if and how they are related .",
    "we find that the two sources remaining constant in their long - term light curves display very different spectral evolution behaviours over time .",
    "we find that cxou j123043.2 + 413818 follows a similar spectral evolution to a disc , loosely following @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 on the parameter - luminosity plot , whilst cxou j123030.8 + 413911 appears to show the opposite trend , with @xmath33 decreasing as the luminosity increases .",
    "although we can not statistically separate model preference , it is interesting to note that each source is consistently better fitted by a particular model . while cxou j123043.2 + 413818 varies in a disc - like manner , it also retains a lower @xmath28@xmath29 fit for mcd , whilst cxou j123030.8 + 413911 is better fitted by a pl - type shape .",
    "we reiterate that we can not offer a statistical distinction between these two models for either source , but suggest that this secondary evidence supports the initial distinction made by @xmath0 fits .    more interestingly",
    ", we find that the spectral fits to the other three sources , cxou j123030.6 + 414142 , cxou j123032.3 + 413918 and cxou j123036.3 + 413837 , appear to show them transiting between these two models , which could potentially be used as a test of our secondary evidence .",
    "if we consider their changing spectral behaviour we find that those observations better modelled by a mcdbb appear to vary in a disc - like fashion in the majority of cases , while those modelled by a pl tend to leave the @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 track .",
    "we also note that the long - term light curves of each of these sources vary substantially ; crucially these flux variations correlate with apparent spectral state , with observations at low luminosities appearing to possess a pl - type shape , with spectra switching to a mcdbb - type state at higher luminosities . again , despite the lack of statistical evidence for a distinction between the models , this behaviour does appear to support the @xmath0 fitting .",
    "if we do accept the changes in spectral shape , then the most obvious explanation of the behaviour of the ulxs is that they can reside in different spectral states , delineated by the pl and mcd spectra , and that in some cases we are observing sources that have undergone a transition from a pl - type to mcd - type state ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "as this is an extremely interesting result , we now consider the physical implications of such behaviour on our understanding of these systems .",
    "a further reason the think that there may be some physical basis for the two spectral types we see in the ngc 4485/4490 ulxs is that they have been seen in other ulxs before .",
    "mizuno et al . ( 2007 ) suggested ( based on observations of two ulxs in ngc 1313 ) that the pl - type state may be representative of the very high state observed in galactic black hole x - ray binary systems , whilst the mcdbb - type state may be more suggestive of the theoretically predicted `` slim disc '' model ( e.g watarai et al .",
    "the latter is supported by observations fit by the @xmath46-free model ( e.g. vierdayanti et al .",
    "the @xmath46-free model assumes that the disc temperature scales as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the radius and @xmath46 is a free parameter . in the case of a standard disc the value of @xmath46",
    "would be fixed at 0.75 but if the @xmath46-value decreases , softer energies become more enhanced , and the spectrum becomes more representative of a slim disc . in the case of the mcdbb - type spectra of m81 x-9 ,",
    "the best fitting parameters reduce the @xmath46-value to 0.6 , significantly smaller than a standard disc value ( miyawaki et al .",
    "2006 ) , supporting the existence of an ultraluminous slim disc state .",
    "kuncic et al .",
    "( 2007 ) made similar associations for the pl - type state , but suggested that this could also be representative of a system with some kind of outflow .",
    "the authors did this by demonstrating that a disc modified with jet emission could also explain the observed spectral shape .",
    "soria & kuncic ( 2008 ) developed this work further , presenting the idea that the pl - type state could be explained by a black hole in the hard state with an associated jet that persisted up to @xmath5 eddington rates , where an outflow - dominated or a slim disc state would be formed .",
    "this allows for the possibility of direct transition from a hard pl - type state to a super - eddington state .",
    "the suspected change in state that we observe is consistent with those found previously and we argue that , although the pl - like spectrum observed appears similar to that of an accreting black hole in the low / hard state , we are probably observing sources residing in the very high state ( vhs ; a.k.a .",
    "steep power - law state , mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the vhs is empirically characterised by a hot disc and a steep power - law in the 2.020.0 kev band .",
    "it should be noted that the power - law component is used as a proxy to describe optically - thin comptonisation , however a spectrum resulting from this process is subtly curved with a shallower slope at lower energies .",
    "here we observe only the lower 0.310.0 kev energy range , although the relatively poor high energy sensitivity of the _ chandra _ acis - s means we only have constraints up to @xmath55 kev . hence we observe only the shallower section of the comptonised component .",
    "this should then also be combined with emission from the 12 kev disc component seen in the vhs ( although data quality is insufficient at present to separate these components ) .",
    "this amalgamation of components could potentially act to flatten the slope of the spectrum below 5 kev , resulting in the range of power - law photon indices observed .",
    "as the mass accretion rate ( and so the observed luminosity ) is increased , it is likely that a change in the accretion structure of the system occurs that invokes a change in spectrum to the mcdbb - like state .",
    "the observed curvilinear structure of such a state would be representative ( in our modest spectral quality regime ) of a slim disc , or an optically - thick comptonising corona masking the inner radii of the disc ( done & kubota 2006 ; stobbart et al .",
    "we note that in each of these model scenarios the disc temperature increases with luminosity ( roberts et al .",
    "2006 ; vierdayanti et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the detection of this possible change in state ( from pl to mcdbb - type or vice - versa ) has previously been noted in other ulx studies .",
    "the clearest transition to date was reported in m81 x-9 by miyawaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , with a transitional luminosity of 1.5@xmath4910@xmath50 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "multiple spectra of ngc 1313 source b were also analysed by the authors but results in this case were not as clear as m81 x-9 .",
    "the tendency towards mcdbb - like spectra with increasing luminosity was apparent , although a precise transition was not evident , occuring within the range @xmath5110@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "similar transitions , from a pl - type state to a mcdbb - type state , have also occured in ic 342 x-1 and x-2 at around 10@xmath52 erg s@xmath2 ( although with only two observations analysed , it is impossible to give a precise transition luminosity ; kubota et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "soria & kuncic ( 2008 ) proposed that the transition between states would occur at around the eddington limit , if we assume little beaming .",
    "based on this proposition the observations reported here provide a potential diagnostic to these systems . allowing us to place constraints on the masses of the black holes contained within the ulxs in ngc 4485/4490 .",
    "firstly we note that it is certainly not necessary to invoke an intermediate mass black hole to achieve the observed luminosities of these systems ( @xmath8 4@xmath4910@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 ) , indicating that these sources need be no more than large stellar - mass compact objects ( @xmath53 if they obey the eddington limit ) . secondly ,",
    "if this apparent state change is occurring at the eddington limit , the luminosity at which a transition is observed would give a rough estimate on the mass of the system .",
    "although we can not observe a distinct change in state at this level of data quality , the variable ulxs in ngc 4485/4490 appear to change state at @xmath5 2@xmath4910@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 , which would mean that these systems are host to @xmath51015 m@xmath54 black holes , i.e. standard stellar - mass black holes . following this argument cxou j123030.8 + 413911 , which continues to reside in the pl - type state up to a luminosity of 2.8@xmath4910@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 ,",
    "could therefore contain a more massive black hole .",
    "interestingly , if we were to extrapolate this argument to other sources where transitions have been reported , with observed transitional luminosities ranging from 215@xmath4910@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 ( including our current sample ) , the primaries of ulxs would range in mass up to no more than @xmath5100 @xmath3 ( m81 x-9 , in agreement with tsunoda et al 2006 ) .",
    "the implications of this argument are in agreement with evidence emerging from other observations of ulxs , a review of which was compiled by roberts ( 2007 ) .",
    "for example , when high quality x - ray spectra are available , a break emerges above 2 kev ( stobbart et al .",
    "2006 ) , which should not be present in the x - ray spectrum of large , @xmath55 intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "this feature is more indicative of some form of extreme accretion onto a smaller compact object .",
    "optical evidence also appears to be converging on similar mass estimates , for example irradiation models describing the optical emission of ulxs have been used to constrain the mass of the black hole for several sources , generally imposing the limit m@xmath56 @xmath8 100 m@xmath54 ( copperwheat et al .",
    "recent developments in theory have shown that it is possible to create black holes with m@xmath56 @xmath8 100 m@xmath54 , in young stellar populations with either low metallicity stars ( fryer & kalogera 2001 , heger et al .",
    "2003 ) , or with the merging of binaries ( belczynski et al .",
    "with evidence from both observation and theory converging on large stellar - mass objects , timely evidence came when prestwich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found such an object .",
    "repeated optical exposures of the wolf - rayet black hole binary known as ic10 x-1 culminated in a radial velocity curve , providing a primary mass estimate of 2334 @xmath3 , the largest stellar - mass black hole found to date ( see also silverman & filippenko 2008 ) . hence it is looking an increasingly realistic proposition that a large fraction of the ulx population are powered by black holes not substantially larger than those we already know of in our own galaxy .",
    "cxou j123029.5 + 413927 was identified as a possible supernova remnant due to its high absorption column , soft underlying continuum and its coincidence with the radio source first j12309.4 + 413927 ( rwwm02 ) .",
    "mid - infrared studies of ngc 4485/4490 , carried out by vzquez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using the _ spitzer space telescope _ , found that five of the ulxs showed high ionization features that are found in agn .",
    "conversely the mid ir spectrum of cxou j123029.5 + 413927 showed emission more indicative of star forming regions .",
    "this , with the addition of a weakly detected [ ovi ] 25.91 @xmath57 m emission line , a line that is recognised as a strong feature in snrs ( morris et al .",
    "2006 ; williams et al .",
    "2006 ) , supports the previous classification .",
    "if it is a snr then it is obviously amongst the brightest of its class - x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath58 erg s@xmath2 are seen in a number of young snrs ( immler & lewin 2003 ) , although typical older snrs are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude fainter in x - rays ( e.g. pannuti et al .",
    "however , in contrast to previous evidence , analysis by fridriksson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported a 30% drop in luminosity for this source in the four months between the second and third _ chandra _ observations , behaviour that is more typical of an x - ray binary source .",
    "a compelling argument on the nature of this source is discovered when looking at the light curve of this source .",
    "we find that previous observations place its detonation ( or at least the epoch at which its x - ray emission brightened ) some time after the 1991 _ rosat _ observation , which would imply that we may be observing a very young snr .",
    "the calculated rate of decay of x - ray flux within the light curve gives further insight .",
    "studies performed using data from early x - ray telescope missions showed that this decay proceeds as @xmath59 with index @xmath60 ( e.g. chevalier & fransson 1994 ) ; however the flux and temperature calculations performed in these earlier studies could have been contaminated by diffuse emission due to the poorer resolution of these satellites .",
    "more recent studies with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have demonstrated that the decay observed within the light curve of a young snr has an index @xmath61 ( e.g. @xmath62 t@xmath63 in immler & kuntz 2005 , t@xmath64 in temple , raychaudhury & stevens 2005 , t@xmath65 in aretxaga et al .",
    "the rate of decay observed in the light curve of cxou j123029.5 + 413927 is found to be @xmath66 , a decay rate that is far shallower than young snrs .",
    "therefore this source _ could _ simply be an x - ray binary system , as suggested by fridriksson et al .",
    "an alternative to this could be a young snr with an additional roughly constant component , diluting the emission and affecting the observed decay rate .",
    "this component could be an x - ray binary system , although it is notable that it hasnt produced the high ionisation nebulae as seen around the other ulxs in ngc 4490 by vzquez et al .",
    "much deeper observations would be required in order to test either hypothesis .",
    "multiple observations of the interacting galaxies ngc 4485 & 4490 have afforded us the opportunity to study its large ulx population , and in particular to see how their emission evolves over time .",
    "we have found that the population is unanimous in its lack of short - term temporal variability , but long - term spectral and temporal variations have given a possible insight into the mass of black holes contained within them .",
    "observations have revealed that sources exhibiting large scale temporal variation ( excluding cxou j123029.5 + 413927 ) may change spectral shape from that of a pl - type to a mcdbb - type as their luminosity increases .",
    "if real - and there is some uncertainty here , as we can not strongly differentiate between fits with pl and mcdbb models based on the current data  this change in spectral shape / state occurs at @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 for the ulxs in this system .",
    "we propose that this state change is from the vhs to an ultraluminous state , a transition that occurs at around the eddington limit .",
    "if this is the case it would imply that _ the majority of the ulx population residing in this interacting galaxy pair are stellar - mass black holes of around 1015 @xmath3_.    the analysis of the possible spectral transitions has culminated in a testable hypothesis that can potentially be applied to other ultraluminous x - ray sources , for example the newly observed transient source cxou j123038.3 + 413830 .",
    "this object has only been observed once to date and so it is impossible to tell at present any more than its current preferred state , a mcd - type state .",
    "the observed luminosity of this source is much lower than the transitional luminosity noted for the majority of sources in our current source population . extrapolating from our above arguments",
    "would suggest that this system contains a compact object of lower mass .",
    "further observations are obviously required to constrain the nature of this source and indeed to continue our study of the behaviour of the whole ulx population of ngc 4485/4490 .",
    "fortunately , this will be possible using time allocated to us on _ xmm - newton_. the resulting data set  to be reported in a follow - up paper  will help us delve deeper into the nature of the remarkable ulx population residing in these galaxies .",
