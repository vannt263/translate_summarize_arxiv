    "the rich dynamic behavior of interacting multi - agent , or particle , systems has been the focus of numerous recent studies .",
    "these multi - particle systems are capable of self - organization , as shown by the various coherent conformations with complex structure that they generate , even when the interactions are short range and in the absence of a leader agent .",
    "the study of these ` swarming ' or ` herding ' systems has had many interesting biological applications which have resulted in a better understanding of the spatio - temporal patterns formed by bacterial colonies , fish , birds , locusts , ants , pedestrians , etc . @xcite .",
    "the mathematical study of these swarming systems is also helpful in the understanding of oscillator synchronization , as in the neural phenomenon of central pattern generators @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies have impacted and have been successfully applied in the design of systems of autonomous , inter - communicating robotic systems @xcite , as well as mobile sensor networks @xcite .",
    "it is possible to design swarming models for robotic motion planning , consensus and cooperative control , and spatio - temporal formation .",
    "pairwise potentials for individual agents can be straightforwardly ported onto autonomous vehicles . furthermore",
    ", these pairwise interactions can be used in conjunction with simple scalable algorithms to achieve multi - vehicle cooperative motion @xcite .",
    "specific goals include : obstacle avoidance @xcite , boundary tracking @xcite , environmental sensing @xcite and decentralized target tracking @xcite .",
    "an important problem is that of environmental consensus estimation . here , the individuals of the swarm communicate with each other through a network to achieve asymptotically synchronous information about their environment @xcite .",
    "recently , consensus was extended to include time delayed communication among agents @xcite .",
    "task allocation is another problem of interest involving robotic swarms .",
    "the objective is to reallocate swarm robots to perform a set of tasks in parallel and independently of one another in an optimal way . in order to make task reallocation more realistic it is possible to consider a time delay that arises from the amount of time required to switch between tasks @xcite .",
    "regardless of the design objective of a robotic swarm system , a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the model must be performed in order to achieve successful algorithm design .",
    "many different mathematical approaches have been utilized to study aggregating agent systems .",
    "some of these studies have treated the problem at a single - individual level , using ordinary differential equations ( odes ) or delay differential equations ( ddes ) to describe their trajectories @xcite .",
    "an alternative method has been proposed by other researchers and consists of using continuum models that consider averaged velocity and agent density fields that satisfy partial differential equations ( pdes ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , authors also have studied the effects of noise on the swarm s behavior and have shown the existence of noise - induced transitions @xcite .",
    "the study of these systems has been enriched by tools from statistical physics since both first and second order phase transitions have been found in the formation of coherent states @xcite .",
    "an additional effect that has recently been considered is that of communication time delays between robots .",
    "time delay models are common in many areas of mathematical biology including population dynamics , neural networks , blood cell maturation , virus dynamics and genetic networks @xcite . in the context of swarming agents",
    ", it has been shown that the introduction of a communication time delay may induce transitions between different coherent states in a manner which depends on the coupling strength between agents and the noise intensity @xcite . thus far , most of the work has concentrated on the case of uniform time delays among agents @xcite .",

    "the case of differing ( and even time - varying ) time delays between agents may be treated similarly to the case of a single delay by using a data buffer @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) swarm that consists of @xmath0 identical self - propelling individuals of unit mass that are mutually attracted to one another in a symmetric fashion .",
    "hence , the coupling of the agents occurs via a fully connected graph .",
    "in addition , we consider the case in which the individuals that comprise the swarm are communicating with each other in a stochastic environment .",
    "because of the finite communication times between individuals , there is a time delay between interactions . assuming that the communication time between agents is constant and equal to @xmath1 , the swarm dynamics is described by the following governing equations :    @xmath2    for @xmath3 .",
    "the terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively represent the 2d position and velocity of the @xmath6-th agent at time @xmath7 .",
    "the strength of the attraction is measured by the coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "the self - propulsion and frictional drag forces on each agent is given by the term @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in the absence of coupling , agents tend to move on a straight line with unit speed @xmath10 as time goes to infinity .",

    "hence , our equations of motion may be considered to be the first term in a taylor expansion of other more general time delayed potential functions about an equilibrium point .",
    "we can investigate the stability of the swarm system by deriving a mean field approximation of the system .",

    "we then obtain a family of hopf bifurcation curves parameterized by @xmath60 :    @xmath61    the first few members of the family of hopf bifurcation curves are shown in fig .",

    "our analysis of the deterministic mean field equations identified the different dynamical behaviors that the approximation given by eq .",
    "exhibits in different regions of the @xmath83 plane .",
    "however , the analysis does not provide any information about how the swarm agents are distributed about the center of mass .",
    "we neglect the stochastic terms in eqs . - and use extensive numerical simulations to identify some of the coherent structures that the swarm adopts asymptotically in time :    * a translational state , in which all swarm particles have identical positions and velocities and move uniformly in a straight line .",
    "the direction of motion depends on the initial conditions .",
    "this behavior is only possible in region a of fig .",
    "[ a_tau_regions ] .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic convergence to this state requires that all particles be located in close proximity and with aligned velocities at the initial time .",
    "hence , the basin of attraction is extremely small which causes this state to be very sensitive to perturbations .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below . * a ring state , in which the center of mass is stationary .",
    "the swarm agents distribute themselves along the ring with roughly half of the agents moving clockwise and half of the agents moving counter - clockwise .",
    "the final stationary position of the center of mass and the particular behavior of each individual in the swarm is dependent on the initial conditions .",

    "this behavior is only possible in region c of fig .",
    "[ a_tau_regions ] .",
    "in addition , it requires that the initial motion of all swarm particles be constrained to a line and so is sensitive with respect to perturbations and noise .",
    "the above list is not extensive and our simulations have revealed other time - asymptotic patterns .",
    "however , all of these other patterns ( and including the translational state and the degenerate rotational state ) require extreme symmetry in the initial conditions and are very sensitive with respect to perturbations and noise .",
    "our numerical simulations suggest that only the ring and the rotational state have a significant robustness with respect to perturbations and noise .",
    "the full system of equations predict a bistable behavior since the translating and ring states are both possible in region a and c [ fig .",
    "[ a_tau_regions ] ] , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "the linear stability analysis of section [ sec : bif ] shows that the mean field approximation fails to capture this bistable behavior .",
    "the mean - field bifurcation results obtained here are of practical value since they provide us with guidelines for selecting values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 that will result in a particular coherent pattern asymptotically in time . in the case of bistability",
    ", our numerical simulations strongly suggest that the initial alignment of the agents velocities is critical in determining the coherent state adopted . specifically , to obtain the translating , rotating and degenerate rotating states asymptotically in time ( structures in which the individuals velocities are perfectly aligned )",
    ", one requires a high alignment of the initial particles velocities ; otherwise , the swarm will adopt the ring state .",
    "however , how high an alignment is needed depends on the specific choice of @xmath72 .",
    "our results indicate that it is easier to obtain aligned states for larger values of the coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not feasible to obtain analytic basin boundaries in this infinite dimensional system . in principle",
    ", one may approximate such boundaries by performing prohibitively extensive numerical simulations where the space of history functions is restricted in some way .",
    "therefore , the computation of basins of attraction is outside the scope of this work and is left for future research .    for the non - degenerate and degenerate rotating states as well as for the translating state , the approximation we made when neglecting the fluctuation terms in eq .",
    "is entirely valid since in the noiseless case all agents collapse to the center of mass . in the case of the ring structure ,",
    "these fluctuation terms are not necessarily small . however , in eq .",
    "all fluctuation terms with the exception of the one containing the factor @xmath84 approximately cancel out in the long time limit , due to the symmetry in the distribution of the agents .",
    "the fluctuation term that remains becomes equal to one in the long time limit .",
    "this has the effect of eliminating the self - propulsion of the center of mass and what remains is solely cubic dissipation .",
    "the following sub - sections contain detailed discussion regarding the spatio - temporal scales of each coherent structure .",
    "the analysis of appendix [ ring ] shows that the radius and angular frequency of the swarm particles on the ring state is given by @xmath85 so that particles move at unit speed , @xmath86 .",
    "we have numerically computed the radius and angular frequency for different values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 within the region in which the mean field approximation gives a stable stationary center of mass ( fig .",

    "we show in appendix [ rotating ] that the circular orbit of the rotating state has radius @xmath87 and frequency @xmath60 that satisfy the following relations :    [ omega_rho_cm_circle ] @xmath88    , @xmath89 space , we plot : hopf ( blue ) and pitchfork ( red ) bifurcation curves , and the curve @xmath90 where the first limit cycle ceases to exist by having its radius diverging to infinity ( green ) . ]",
    "- can have as many solutions as desired by choosing @xmath17 and @xmath18 large enough .",
    "however , a careful analysis reveals that the solutions to eqs . -",
    "are generated exactly along the hopf curves of our previous mean field analysis and represent the same limit cycles of that analysis [ fig .",
    "[ hopf_pitchfork_a_tau ] ] .",
    "the expressions in eqs . - thus determine the spatio - temporal scales of these circular orbits beyond the hopf curves where they are born .",
    "our analysis also shows that the circular limit cycle that is created on the first member of the hopf bifurcation curves persists to the left of the pitchfork bifurcation curve and then ceases to exist as its radius diverges to infinity on the curve @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "[ circle_birth_death ] ) .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations of the mean field equations reveal that both the translating state and the rotating state are linearly stable for @xmath92 pairs inside the wedge between the curve @xmath91 and the pitchfork bifurcation curve @xmath93 above the bt point .",
    "figures [ circle_radius]-[circle_sim_map ] show the excellent agreement between numerical simulations and the analytical results given by eqs . - , for different values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "interestingly , in fig . [ circle_speed ] we note that in the asymptotic time limit the collapsed agents move at a speed greater than one , the speed at which agents would tend to move in the absence of coupling .",
    "this is explained by noting that the ratio of the time delay to the period of oscillations is such that the delayed position of the collapsed agents @xmath94 is ahead of the present position @xmath95 .",
    "the attraction that an individual particle feels to the delayed position of the rest of the swarm forces the whole system go faster .",
    "a degenerate version of the rotating state is possible when the initial motion of the swarm is restricted to a line , since in this case it follows from eqs . -",
    "that the swarm will remain on such a line for all times . as we show in appendix [ deg_rotating ]",
    ", we may assume that the motion of the collapsed swarm occurs on the @xmath96 line of the center of mass coordinates and then use a finite fourier mode approximation of the ensuing dynamics .",
    "an approximation in terms of just three modes gives @xmath97 where @xmath60 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are obtained by solving eqs .",

    "there is excellent agreement in both amplitude and period between our analysis and the numerical simulations [ figs .",

    "the agreement for the speed of motion is very good as well , but the theoretical estimate is shifted slightly with respect to the results from simulations [ fig .",

    ", we note that the collapsed set of particles have a maximum speed which exceeds one , the speed that individual , uncoupled particles acquire in the long - time limit . as before ,",

    "in the absence of noise , the initial alignment of the swarm particles is critical in determining the asymptotic behavior of the swarm ( sec .  [",

    "when noise is introduced , the interplay of coupling strength , time delay and noise intensity gives rise to very interesting behavior due to fluctuations in the particles alignment .",

    "more surprising , however , is that if the coupling strength @xmath17 and/or the time delay @xmath18 are big enough , then there is a noise intensity threshold that forces a transition in the swarm from misaligned into aligned states .",

    "once the delay is turned on , the translating state is broken up and the swarm converges to the ring state in which the mean particle alignment is near zero .",

    "a completely analogous situation ensues for parameters in region b of fig .",

    "we thus conclude that for these choices of @xmath83 pairs , the noise misaligns the particles velocities and forces a transition into the ring state .",
    "in contrast to the cases discussed above , for parameters in region c of fig . [ a_tau_regions ] , a sufficiently large noise intensity promotes transitions from misaligned to aligned states .",

    "an examination of the full simulation data reveals that the transition occurs as an increasing group of particles gradually becomes aligned and eventually absorbs all the remaining particles .",
    "a sufficient amount of noise is necessary for this transition , since it allows each particles velocity vector to probe many directions until finally enough of them become trapped in a ` potential well ' of alignment with other particles . as with the first case of simulations a noise standard deviation bigger than @xmath116 breaks up the rotating state .",
    "figure [ dr_allign_a_2_tau_2 ] clearly shows the transition from the ring to the compact , rotational state through the time evolution of the ensemble averages of the particle distances to the center of mass and of the mean particle alignment .",

    "our bifurcation studies demonstrated the existence of a bogdanov - takens point , where the stationary center of mass solution has a double zero eigenvalue , which is critical in organizing the dynamics of the swarm .",
    "the stable patterns that are possible for this system have several applications for autonomous vehicles .",
    "more detailed applications for each pattern are as follows : ( 1 ) the translational state may be used for target tracking and group transport @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the ring state should prove useful in terrain coverage and regional surveillance @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the rotating state may be exploited in obstacle avoidance , boundary tracking and surveillance @xcite .",
    "in addition , we believe all three patterns are applicable to the problem of environmental sensing @xcite .    in numerical experiments with noise , we showed that the interplay of coupling strength , time delay and noise intensity may give rise to interesting switching behavior from one coherent structure to another .",
    "we found that if the coupling strength @xmath17 and/or the time delay @xmath18 are below a certain limit , then the presence of noise induces transitions from states in which the alignment of the particles velocities is high into states with low alignment .",
    "more surprising , however , is that if the coupling strength @xmath17 and/or the time delay @xmath18 are big enough , then there is a noise intensity threshold that forces a transition in the swarm from misaligned into aligned states .",
    "in addition , by using a time - dependent noise intensity at these high values of @xmath17 and/or @xmath18 , we show that the system exhibits hysteresis since the swarm s transitions are not easily reversible .",
    "we note that analytical results on the effects of noise on delay - coupled swarms are not easy to obtain .",
    "two examples relevant to our work are given in @xcite , where the authors investigate models similar to the one presented here but without time delay .",
    "realistic application of the model treated here to the motion of multi - robot systems requires local repulsion among individuals to be taken into account .",
    "we have simulated the swarm model with the addition of a repulsive inter - agent potential of exponential form @xmath124 .",
    "these simulations demonstrate ( results not shown ) that the coherent patterns we discussed in this article persist when the characteristic repulsion length @xmath125 and repulsion strength @xmath126 between robots are small compared to global attraction parameters .",
    "stronger repulsion can destabilize the coherent structures .",
    "recently , systems with non - uniform time delays have received much attention .",
    "for example , the important question of synchronization in networks communicating at randomly - distributed time delays has been recently investigated @xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "the case of differing ( and even time - varying ) time delays between agents may be treated similarly to the case of a single delay by using a data buffer @xcite .",
    "the idea is to identify an upper bound to the time delay ( @xmath127 ) between all agent pairs and then design the agents so that the actuation occurs when the data buffer of size @xmath127 is full .    as part of our ongoing work",
    ", we are extending our investigations for the cases in which : ( _ i _ ) the communication time delays vary between different pairs of agents ; and ( _ ii _ ) the communication graph is non - globally coupled . in realistic settings , both of these cases may occur due to the effects of the spatial distribution of agents such as signal travel times and imperfect transmission arising , for example , from complex terrain topography or component malfunction . in the case of communication delays that differ among different pairs of agents ( though constant in time ) ,",
    "our preliminary results show some patterns analogous to the ones observed here , but with much more added complexity .",
    "the present investigation lays a good foundation on which to base the study of these more complicated cases .    in summary ,",
    "our results aid in understanding the stability of complex coherent structures in swarming systems with time delayed communication and in the presence of a noisy environment .",
    "although our analytical and numerical results were obtained using a model with linear , attractive interactions , our analysis gives useful insight for the study of models with more general forms of time delayed coupling between agents .",
    "our results may prove to be valuable for the control of man - made vehicles where actuation and communication are delayed , as well as in understanding swarm alignment in biological systems .",
    "the swarm ring state is obtained when the center of mass is stationary .",
    "for the solution @xmath128const . to satisfy eq .",
    "we require @xmath129    we simplify eq . by taking @xmath128const . and using eq .",
    "@xmath130 we consider the large system size limit @xmath131 and we drop the delayed term .",
    "the resulting equations are simply odes and so the analysis below shows that the ring orbit is not dependent on having time delays in the system .",
    "writing eq . in polar coordinates @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we obtain    @xmath134    equations - have the trivial solution @xmath135 as well as a ring solution : @xmath136 in which particles move at unit speed , @xmath86 .",
    "in the noiseless rotating state , all particles collapse to a point , @xmath137 , and the equation for the center of mass given by eq .",
    "simplifies considerably to @xmath138 we write @xmath36 and introduce polar coordinates @xmath139 and @xmath140 to obtain    @xmath141    where we ve written @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "equations - have a circular orbit solution , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where    @xmath146    and @xmath147 is obtained from the initial conditions . in the main text",
    "we discuss the behavior of the solutions to eqs . - .",
    "when the motion of the whole swarm is initially constrained to a line , eqs . - dictate that the swarm will remain on this line for all times .",
    "if the coupling parameter @xmath17 and/or the time delay @xmath18 are large enough , the resulting motion is a degenerate form of the rotating solution in which the swarm moves back and forth along a straight line .    in the case without noise",
    "all particles collapse to a point , @xmath137 , and the line along which motion occurs is arbitrary ; here we use @xmath148 .",
    "the problem reduces to analyzing a single delay equation given by @xmath149 we find a solution using fourier analysis .",
    "we let @xmath150 where the coefficients satisfy @xmath151 in order to ensure that @xmath152 is a real quantity . substituting eq . into eq . , we get for the @xmath153-th mode @xmath154 for @xmath155 . the @xmath156 equation is @xmath157 which does not involve @xmath158 .",
    "unsurprisingly , @xmath158 is undetermined since the position of the center of mass may be translated in space without modifying the dynamics of the system .",
    "we now approximate the motion of the center of mass by keeping the first three modes . by appropriately choosing the time origin",
    ", we may take @xmath98 to be purely real and positive .",
    "in contrast , @xmath159 and @xmath99 are complex quantities which we write as @xmath160 , for @xmath161 .",
    "the equations for the first three modes @xmath162 become    @xmath163    in addition , the condition from eq .",
    "becomes @xmath164 separating eqs .",
    "- and eq . into real and imaginary parts",
    "yields a system of seven equations ( since the real part of eq . is satisfied automatically ) for the six unknowns : @xmath60 , @xmath98 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath100 .",
    "these equations can not be satisfied in general . however , if @xmath168 , then the equation for mode @xmath169 [ eq . ] and eq .",
    "are satisfied automatically , leaving four equations :    @xmath170    for the four unknowns @xmath60 , @xmath98 , @xmath167 and @xmath100 .",
    "equations - may be solved numerically and permit one to approximate the motion of the center of mass in the form @xmath171    the frequency of the straight line orbit of the swarm center of mass is approximately equal to the frequency of the circular orbit in eq . .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of oscillation of the straight line orbit is approximately equal to the radius of the circular orbit of eq",
