    "recently , a successful description of the particle ratios measured in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been achieved in the framework of so - called thermal models @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient of this approach is the proper inclusion of the hadronic resonances , whose decays contribute in an essential way to the final multiplicities of the observed hadrons . in the first part of this paper",
    "the simple thermal model is used to find the optimal values of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the ratios measured at rhic . in the second part",
    "we calculate the @xmath3 spectra of hadrons in the thermal model , including all resonances and using an analytic formula .",
    "the spectra , besides the original thermal distribution , receive large contributions from the decaying resonances .",
    "the inclusion of all possible decays is important , since only in that way one can obtain a clean separation and identification of other effects such as expansion , flow @xcite , or medium modifications @xcite , which influence the final shape of the @xmath3 distributions .",
    "the present analysis computes the spectra in a static fireball , and is introductory to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effects of expansion are incorporated and very good agreement with experiment is achieved .",
    "in the thermal model the particle densities are calculated from the ideal - gas expression @xmath4 \\pm 1 } ,   \\label{ni}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the spin degeneracy factor of the @xmath6th hadron , @xmath7 are the baryon number , strangeness , and the third component of isospin , and @xmath8 .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the chemical potentials enforcing the appropriate conservation laws .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ ni ] ) is used to calculate the `` primordial '' densities of stable hadrons and resonances at the chemical freeze - out .",
    "the final multiplicities receive contributions from the primordial stable hadrons , as well as from the secondary hadrons produced by sequential decays of resonances after the freeze - out .",
    "we include _ all _ light - flavor hadrons ( with the appropriate branching ratios ) listed in the newest review of particle physics @xcite .",
    "we neglect the finite - size and excluded volume corrections . ) by the boltzmann distribution function , for which the excluded volume corrections factorize .",
    "we have checked that the use of the classical statistics changes the values of the thermodynamic parameters by less than 3% . ] the temperature , @xmath11 , and the baryonic chemical potential , @xmath12 , are fitted by minimizing the expression @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the @xmath15th measured ratio , @xmath16 is the corresponding error , and @xmath17 is the same ratio as determined from the thermal model . the potentials @xmath18 and @xmath10 are determined by the two requirements : the initial strangeness of the system is zero , and the ratio of the baryon number to the electric charge is the same as in the colliding nuclei .",
    "table 1 presents our fit to the particle ratios measured at rhic . in our calculation , the identical ratios measured by different groups are treated separately in the definition of @xmath19 ( number of points @xmath20 ) . in this way",
    "the measurements done by different groups enter independently .",
    "very similar results are obtained if we first average the results of different groups to obtain the most likely value for each considered ratio .",
    "our optimal value of @xmath21 mev is consistent with the value of the critical temperature as inferred from the lattice simulations of qcd ( with three massless flavors @xmath22 mev , whereas with two massless flavors @xmath23 mev @xcite ) .",
    "we have also calculated other characteristics of the freeze - out .",
    "in particular , we find the energy density @xmath24 gev/@xmath25 , the pressure @xmath26 0.08 gev/@xmath25 , and the baryon density @xmath27 0.02 @xmath28 .",
    "our calculation confirms the cleymans - redlich conjecture @xcite that the energy per hadron at the chemical freeze - out is 1 gev ( our approach yields @xmath29 1.0 gev ) .",
    "we observe , however , that the average energy per baryon is much larger than the average energy per meson : @xmath30 1.6 gev and @xmath31 0.9 gev .",
    "similar differences occur also for other heavy - ion collisions studied at ags and sps .",
    "they are caused by the different growth rates of the meson and baryon mass spectra @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the ratios @xmath32 and @xmath33 are practically unaffected by the weak decays . in conclusion ,",
    "the thermal model works well for the rhic particle ratios , with thermal parameters assuming anticipated values .",
    "we note that our @xmath11 is 9 mev lower than 174 mev of ref .",
    "@xcite , and 25 mev lower than 190 mev obtained in ref .",
    "nevertheless , the results of the three calculations are consistent within errors , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ figchi2 ] . an interesting feature shown in fig .",
    "[ figchi2 ] is the characteristic valley of the optimal parameters .",
    "the shape of this valley indicates that the quality of the fit does not change if we moderately increase or decrease both @xmath11 and @xmath34 .",
    "next , we come to the discussion of the @xmath35 spectra . similarly to the particle multiplicities , the momentum spectra of the observed hadrons contain two contributions .",
    "the first ,  primordial  contribution is purely thermal and is described by distribution functions characterized by the thermodynamic parameters at freeze - out .",
    "the second contribution comes from sequential decays of the resonances .",
    "since a substantial part of the produced particles comes from the decays , one may expect that the measured spectra are significantly changed by this effect .",
    "indeed , it has been already known for a long time that the resonance decays modify the low-@xmath35 spectrum , due to the limited phase space of the emitted particles @xcite .",
    "so far , however , a rather limited number of the resonances has been included in such analyses .",
    "we take into account all two- and three - body hadronic decays . in this study",
    "we neglect other effects which can change the spectra , such as expansion or flow .    below we sketch our method of dealing with two- and three - body decays .",
    "the initial momentum distribution function of a resonance in the fireball rest frame , @xmath36 , as well as the momentum distribution of the emitted particle in the resonance s rest frame , are isotropic .",
    "the latter is true , since we average over all possible polarization states .",
    "thus , in the case of a two - body decay , the spectrum of the emitted particle ( denoted by index 1 ) is obtained from the expression @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the momentum of the emitted particle in the rest frame of the resonance , and @xmath39is the lorentz transformation to the fireball rest frame , @xmath40{\\bf v}_{k}.\\ ] ] here @xmath41 is the momentum of the resonance in the fireball , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . in eq .",
    "( [ ftilde ] ) @xmath44 is the magnitude of @xmath38 and @xmath45 .",
    "the standard formula gives @xmath46^{1/2 }   \\over 2m_{r}},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the mass of the resonance , whereas @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the masses of the emitted particles .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 is the branching ratio for the considered channel , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spins of the resonance and particle 1 , respectively . the physical interpretation of eq . ( [ ftilde ] ) is clear : the isotropic distribution of particle 1 in the resonance rest frame , @xmath53 , is boosted to the fireball frame , and there folded with the resonance distribution @xmath36 .    in order to write eq .",
    "( [ ftilde ] ) in a more compact form , we do the change of variables : @xmath54 the integration over @xmath55 in ( [ ftilde ] ) becomes trivial and we find @xmath56 since the quantity @xmath57 is the momentum of the emitted particle in the reference frame connected with the resonance , we may rewrite eq .",
    "( [ ftilde1 ] ) in the explicitly lorentz - covariant way @xmath58 here @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the four - momenta of the resonance and of the emitted particle , respectively .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ ftilde2 ] ) was used previously by , koch , and heinz @xcite . in their approach , however , no assumptions about the isotropic emission were made , so @xmath36 and consequently @xmath61 were treated as the functions of two arguments : rapidity and transverse momentum . in our approach @xmath36 and @xmath61 depend only on the magnitude of the three - momenta , and integration over the polar and azimuthal angles in ( [ ftilde2 ] ) can be done analytically .",
    "this leads to a simple expression @xmath62 where the limits of the integration are @xmath63 .",
    "( [ ftildecom ] ) is a relativistic generalization of the formula derived in ref .",
    "its simplicity turns out to be especially important in the numerical treatment of the sequential decays .    in the case of three - body",
    "decays we can follow the same steps as above , with the extra modification connected with the fact that different values of @xmath64 are possible now .",
    "this introduces an additional integration in eq .",
    "( [ ftilde ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the allowed values of @xmath65 may be obtained from the phase - space integral @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the momenta of the emitted particles , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the corresponding energies ( all measured in the resonance rest frame ) , @xmath71 is the matrix element describing the three - body decay , and @xmath72 is the normalization constant . for sake of simplicity we assume , similarly as in @xcite , that @xmath71 can be approximated by a constant .",
    "operationally , the final expression for three - body decays is a folding of two - body decays over @xmath44 with a weight following from elementary considerations based on eq .",
    "( [ gp1 ] ) .",
    "our numerical procedure is as follows : we initialize the spectra of all hadrons as given by the thermal model .",
    "next , we start from the heaviest particle , and proceed with the decay , thus feeding the spectra of the products .",
    "we repeat this step for all particles , going down with the mass , untill all resonances are taken into account .",
    "our results for the @xmath0 spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ figspec ] .",
    "the initial thermal distributions are represented by the dashed lines , whereas the final distributions are represented by the solid lines . in the case of pions",
    "the long - dashed line shows the result of including two - body decays only .",
    "we observe that the final distributions of hadrons are considerably steeper than the original distributions .",
    "we term this phenomenon as _",
    " cooling  of the spectra by secondary decays_. for the pions the initial inverse slope , calculated in the range 0.3 gev @xmath73 0.9 gev @xcite , equals 219 mev .",
    "hadronic decays cool it by 34 mev down to 185 mev .",
    "the last value agrees well with the measurement of the phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "( dotted lines ) do not correspond to the physical temperature characterizing the thermal distribution @xmath74 .",
    "this effect is induced by the presence of @xmath75 as a prefactor multiplying the thermal distribution in the expression for the yield : @xmath76 .",
    "since the values of @xmath75 are not asymptotic , the inverse slopes obtained in the region of @xmath77 gev are considerably higher than the temperature . ]",
    "the inverse slopes obtained for other hadrons are smaller than those inferred from the data .",
    "definitely , other processes influence the observed spectra .",
    "our calculation does not show any peaked low-@xmath0 enhancement in the pion spectrum .",
    "it would , if for instance we had included only the @xmath78 decays .",
    "however , with all decays included , the increase of the spectrum is uniform due to the fact that different decays populate different momenta .",
    "the shape of the pion spectrum in fig .",
    "[ figspec ] is concave , thus the thermal model does not reproduce the experimental convex shape @xcite .",
    "one can see that the contributions from the three - body decays to the pion spectrum are important at small momenta , however , they are smaller than the contributions from the two - body decays .",
    "the impact of three - body decays on other spectra is negligible .",
    "certainly , the expansion or flow effects further modify the spectra .",
    "their inclusion is necessary to obtain the complete agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of  cooling  from secondary decays described in this paper is an important ingredient of any analysis of momentum spectra in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ."
