    "flares and coronal mass ejections drive geomagnetic disturbances ( gmd ) that lead to changes in the earth s magnetic field , which then create geo - electric fields .",
    "these low - frequency geo - electric fields induce quasi - dc currents , also known as geomagnetically - induced currents ( gics ) , in grounded sections of power system networks @xcite .",
    "the gic are superimposed on the usual alternating currents ( ac ) and bias the ac such that the maximum currents are increased . in many power system components ,",
    "this bias is not a major concern , however , in transformers , this bias can lead to half - cycle saturation of transformers and the loss of magnetic flux to regions outside of the transformer core .",
    "the energy stored in the stray flux increases the reactive power consumption of the transformer , which can affect system voltages .",
    "the stray flux also drives eddy currents that can cause excessive transformer heating leading to reduced transformer life or , potentially , immediate damage @xcite .",
    "the potential impacts of gmd to large power power transformers in the bulk electric power system have led the united states government to try to increase the understanding of and mitigate the impacts of such events@xcite . to mitigate the potential risks introduced by gic to power systems ,",

    "these models have been used to conduct risk analysis @xcite that investigate the sensitivity of transformer reactive power losses due to gic and concluded that risk and risk mitigation warrants further study .",
    "one focus in the recent literature has been on mitigating the effect of gic on transformer reactive power consumption and subsequent drops in system voltages and potential voltage collapse .",
    "one approach to mitigation is the installation of dc - current blocking devices to keep the gic from entering through transformer neutrals @xcite , however , these devices are expensive with costs for a single unit close to $ 500k @xcite . in an attempt to minimize the projected cost of mitigation",
    ", optimization - based methods have been developed to guide the siting of these blocking devices . instead of performing a full power systems analysis that includes the ac , gic and full ac power flow equations , these papers have primarily focused on minimizing induced reactive losses independent of the normal ac currents .",
    "the intuition of these surrogate models is that small amounts of reactive losses imply small voltage impacts and presumably a secure power system .    beyond voltage effects",
    ", the literature on risk mitigation associated with transformer heating is relatively sparse .",
    "existing studies focus on assessing transformer susceptibility to gic effects @xcite and formulating the thermal response of transformer cores to different levels of gmds @xcite .",

    "the work discussed above is a very important start , but it leaves a number of open questions , which we address in this manuscript .",
    "first , the installation of blocking devices is very expensive and cost may pose a barrier to adoption .",
    "instead , we focus on developing a gic - aware optimal power flow ( opf ) model that uses existing controls such as generator dispatch , load shedding , and line switching to mitigate the risks of gic impacts .",
    "second , we incorporate the ac physics of power flow into the gic - aware opf because these physics play an important role in the impacts associated with gic . for example , while minimizing reactive losses may imply small voltage problems across the whole system , such a model could focus all of the losses in a small part of a system and miss a local voltage problem .",
    "more importantly , models of hotspot thermal heating inherently depend on both gic and ac .",

    "<S> in recent years , there have been increasing concerns about how geomagnetic disturbances ( gmds ) impact electrical power systems . </S>",
    "<S> geomagnetically - induced currents ( gics ) can saturate transformers , induce hot spot heating and increase reactive power losses . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can potentially cause catastrophic damage to transformers and severely impact the ability of a power system to deliver power . to address this problem , we develop a model of gic impacts to power systems that includes 1 ) gic thermal capacity of transformers as a function of normal alternating current ( ac ) and 2 ) reactive power losses as a function of gic . </S>",
    "<S> we use this model to derive an optimization problem that protects power systems from gic impacts through line switching , generator dispatch , and load shedding . </S>",
    "<S> we employ state - of - the - art convex relaxations of ac power flow equations to lower bound the objective . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the approach on a modified rts96 system and show that line switching is an effective means to mitigate gic impacts . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a sensitivity analysis of decisions with respect to gmd direction .    </S>",
