    "the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite is an electron - positron collider with a centre - of - mass energy up to 1 tev and a luminosity goal of @xmath0 .",
    "the achievement of this goal is challenging , and requires nanometre - sized colliding beams at the interaction point , achieved through emittance reductions in dedicated damping rings and strong focusing before the interaction point .",
    "this , combined with the high bunch charge leads to intense electromagnetic interactions when the beams collide , causing particles of each bunch to be deflected by the space charge of the other .",
    "such deflections strongly enhance the angular divergence of the outgoing beams and significantly dilute their energy distributions , through radiation of so - called beamstrahlung photons .",
    "re - interactions involving these photons also produce additional secondary charged particles .",
    "the production of beamstrahlung , whilst exploitable as a diagnostic , is generally troublesome to the design of the interaction region and subsequent extraction line .",
    "the photons are produced in the direction of the outgoing beam , with considerable power ( in the order of mws ) , in a cone of some opening angle in the forward direction ( typically up to a mrad ) , and must be dumped in a controlled way .",
    "they may irradiate parts of the machine , potentially quench superconducting magnets and produce backgrounds in the interaction region detectors , through backscattering .",
    "hence a detailed knowledge and characterisation of the beamstrahlung production is critical to successful linear collider design .",
    "a further contribution to the photon spectrum arises from the so - called compton photons .",
    "these correspond to quantum interactions between electrons and positrons of the colliding beams , where the accompanying photon radiation has high energy .",
    "the dominant contribution is from the radiative bhabha process , in the particular kinematic domain involving the exchange of a virtual photon only slightly off mass - shell .",
    "the hard part of this process can be described as compton scattering of a beam particle on this quasi - real photon , and mostly factorises from the part corresponding to its emission off the electron or positron on the other side .",
    "the total power corresponding to these additional photons is however only a few tens of watts and they are radiated with angles comparable to those of the beamstrahlung photons .    in this report ,",
    "comprehensive calculations of the beamstrahlung and compton photon production for the newest ilc beam parameter sets are presented .",
    "the resulting photon angular distributions are obtained and a set of cone half - opening angles to represent successive total beamstrahlung powers are presented for each ilc parameter set . in section  [ seccalcs ] the computational methods and the ilc parameter sets under consideration are discussed . in section  [ sectheory ]",
    "approximate analytical expectations of the photon cones are calculated .",
    "they are compared to computational results in section  [ secresults ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ secconc ] , including the practical beam stay - clear requirements in terms of cone half - opening angles .",
    "in this section , the current ilc beam parameter sets , the key parameters relevant to beamstrahlung production and the method used to simulate the beamstrahlung and compton photons are described .",
    "the latest ilc beam parameter sets  @xcite are similar to the previous working space for the 500 gev machine whilst reducing the magnitude of the beam - beam interaction for the 1 tev case , resulting in smaller mean particle energy losses to beamstrahlung photons , @xmath1 , at that energy .",
    "the parameters for the new working space relevant to this work are shown in table  [ tabparasets ] , where e , n@xmath2 , n , @xmath3 , p and @xmath4 are the centre - of - mass energy , the number of bunches per train , the number of particles per bunch , the luminosity , the total power contained in the beamstrahlung photons and the r.m.s bunch sizes in the horizontal , vertical and longitudinal dimensions , respectively",
    ".    ._key parameters of the new beam parameter sets used in this work , at 500 gev and 1 tev in the centre - of - mass . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabprimanglesextra ]    since they use the rigid beam model , these calculations are only valid in the horizontal plane and for cases with small disruption .",
    "comparing tables  [ tab500beamcone ] and  [ tabtevbeamcone ] indicates that the calculations predict the maximum horizontal angle of photon emissions reasonably well only for some of the parameter sets .",
    "for example , the 500 gev nominal theoretical maximum angle is 0.376 mrad , which agrees well with the 0.35 - 0.39 mrad range computed from the beam - beam simulation for the 100 - 1 w criteria .",
    "this is however not the case for the large y and high luminosity sets , where some differences are seen .",
    "such differences are attributed to extreme colliding particle trajectories in guinea - pig .",
    "these may originate from the input angular distribution of the beams and may also result from some disruption occuring for these parameter sets . in all cases ,",
    "the guinea - pig calculation gives larger values and should be used for conservative results .",
    "similar distributions for the compton photons are presented in figures  [ fig500compt ] and  [ figtevcompt ] , in the horizontal and vertical planes and for the five parameter sets . while extending to similar angles as for beamstrahlung photons , the corresponding power is orders of magnitude less .",
    "the maximum cone half - opening angles previously computed from beamstrahlung are hence not modified .",
    "in this paper , the angles of photons emitted through the beam - beam interaction at the international linear collider have been computed using both the rigid beam model and the beam - beam simulator guinea - pig .",
    "these calculations , and the subsequent understanding of the beamstrahlung , are crucial to the effective design of the interaction region and extraction line .",
    "the rigid beam theoretical predictions tend to underestimate the photon cone opening angles for some of the beam parameter sets , particularly for cases with large disruption .",
    "guinea - pig is hence used for conservative results .",
    "cones of excluded photon power are defined corresponding to tolerances relevant to different aspects of beam - line design : 100 w for general activation and 10 - 1 w for super - conductive magnet quenching .",
    "two contributions were studied , from beamstrahlung emission and from a compton process involving the exchange of a slightly virtual photon between the incident electrons and positrons . by",
    "far the first contribution dominates for most of the angles .",
    "the results are summarised in table  [ tabprimangles ] .    for the general design of the extraction line , the 100 w definition is applicable .",
    "in this case , half - opening angles of 0.75 and 0.85 mrad can be used as conservative definitions of the required beam - stay - clear in the horizontal and vertical planes , respectively .",
