    "phonon - drag thermopower is found to dominate in a temperature range that starts at very low temperature , i. e. , below @xmath1 = 1 k in bulk gaas.@xcite different efforts were made to experimentally separate the diffusion thermopower and the phonon - drag contribution .",

    "both thermometers act in addition as ohmic contacts to the 2deg by the use of segregated niauge , so we can guarantee that the position at which the thermovoltage is measured can be associated with a precise temperature at the membrane .",

    "the different phonon scattering mechanisms enter into the model with their corresponding relaxation times , which are combined in the total relaxation time @xmath19 according to matthiessen s rule : @xmath20 with the phonon frequency @xmath21 , the debye temperature @xmath22 and the average phonon group velocity @xmath23 m / s .",

    "the linear form of the phonon - electron scattering rate is adequate for scattering in a degenerate semiconductor @xcite and the fourth - power dependence of the defect scattering rate is commonly used for rayleigh scattering at point defects.@xcite + thus , from a fit with the callaway model , we obtain information about the rates of different phonon scattering mechanisms and their contribution to the thermal resistivity of the membrane .",

    "+ furthermore , according to the fit results , phonon - electron scattering gives a negligible contribution to the thermal resistivity .",
    "this can be explained with the membrane setup , that contains free charge carriers only in the spatially confined plane of the 2deg in combination with the dominance of boundary and defect scattering in the structure .",
    "+ we find that the value of @xmath25 for defect scattering deduced from the fit is in the order of those measured in bulk gaas , indicating that the rate of point defect scattering is not significantly changed in our membrane.@xcite phonon - defect scattering is responsible for the reduced rise of @xmath34 at temperatures above 10 k. + the value of @xmath26 for phonon - phonon umklapp scattering in our membrane is about an order of magnitude smaller than bulk values .",
    "we expect from the result of the callaway model that phonon - umklapp scattering will gain influence in the membrane not below 100 k. this is in contrast to bulk gaas where umklapp scattering processes already become dominant at temperatures above 10 k.@xcite + we note that the run of the thermal conductivity of our membrane is comparable to thermal conductivities determined in earlier work by fon et al .",
    "@xcite on gaas nanobars of 200 nm by 250 nm cross sectional area .",
    "the thermal conductivities for those membranes are two orders of magnitude reduced , which we attribute to the two orders of magnitude larger width of our membrane with respect to the nanobars studied by fon .",
    "+ in addition to the phonons , the electrons in the leads and the hall bar contribute to the thermal conductivity @xmath34 of the membrane .",

    "however , with @xmath40 w@xmath41k@xmath42 in the temperature range @xmath43 k the thermal conductivities of the leads and the 2deg are negligible compared to the measured thermal conductivities .",
    "utilizing the low thermal conductivity of the membrane compared to bulk material , the thermopower @xmath44 was determined by measuring the thermovoltage between contacts that were only 34 @xmath0 m apart . here",
    "we report on measurements performed at temperatures between 2.7 k and 14 k without an external magnetic field .",
    "the thermopower @xmath45 arises from two contributions , the charge carrier diffusion @xmath46 and the so - called phonon drag @xmath47.@xcite the latter is caused by the phonon wind , from which momentum is transferred to the charge carriers . to calculate the diffusion thermopower @xmath46",
    ", we assume the mott formula@xcite to be a good approximation for temperatures below 20 k : @xmath48 the diffusion thermopower thus is proportional to the ratio of the temperature to the fermi temperature of the electronic system .",
    "furthermore , it depends on the parameter @xmath49 that takes account for the energy - dependence of the carrier scattering time . as in previous publications @xcite , we assume that the electronic conductivity can be expressed in terms of an energy dependent relaxation time @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the electron energy , @xmath52 a function of temperature ( but independent of @xmath51 ) and the power factor @xmath49 is the parameter occurring in eq .",
