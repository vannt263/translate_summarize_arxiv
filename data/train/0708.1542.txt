    "_ extreme events _ ( also called critical transitions , disasters , catastrophes and crises ) are a most important yet least understood feature of many natural and human - made processes . among examples are destructive earthquakes , el - nios , economic depressions , stock - market crashes , and major terrorist acts .",
    "extreme events are relatively rare , and at the same time they inflict a lion s share of the damage to population , economy , and environment . accordingly , studying the extreme events is pivotal both for fundamental predictive understanding of complex systems and for disaster preparedness ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we work within a framework that emphasizes mechanisms underlying formation of extreme events .",
    "prominent among such mechanisms is _ direct cascading _ or _",
    "fragmentation_. among other applications , this mechanism is at the heart of the study of 3d turbulence @xcite . a statistical model of direct cascade is conveniently given by the branching processes ; they describe populations in which each individual can produce descendants ( offsprings ) according to some probability distribution .",
    "a branching process may incorporate _ spatial _ dynamics , several types of particles ( multi - type processes ) , age - dependence ( random lifetimes of particles ) , and immigration due to external driving forces @xcite .",
    "in many real - world systems , observations are only possible within a specific domain of the phase space of a system .",
    "accordingly , we consider here a system with an _ unobservable _ source of external driving ultimately responsible for extreme events .",
    "we assume that observations can only be made on a _",
    "subspace _ of the phase space .",
    "the direct cascade ( branching ) within a system starts with injection of the largest particles into the source .",
    "these particles are divided into smaller and smaller ones , while spreading away from the source and eventually reaching the subspace of observations .",
    "an important observer s goal is to locate the external driving source .",
    "the distance between the observation subspace and the source thus becomes a natural control parameter .",
    "an extreme event in this system can be defined as emergence of a large particle in the observation subspace .",
    "clearly , as the source approaches the subspace of observation , the total number of observed particles increases , the bigger particles become relatively more frequent , and the probability of an extreme event increases . in this paper",
    ", we give a complete quantitative description of this phenomenon for an age - dependent multi - type branching diffusion process with immigration in @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that our model closely reproduces the major premonitory patterns of extreme events observed in hierarchical complex systems .",
    "extreme events in such systems are preceded by transformation of size distribution in the permanent background activity ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , general activity increases , in favor of relatively strong although sub - extreme events . that was established first by analysis of multiple",
    "fracturing and seismicity @xcite , and later generalized to socio - economic processes @xcite .",
    "our results suggest a simple universal mechanism of such premonitory patterns .",
    "the system consists of particles indexed by their _ generation _ @xmath1 .",
    "particles of zero generation ( _ immigrants _ ) are injected into the system by an external forcing .",
    "particles of any generation @xmath2 are produced as a result of splitting of particles of generation @xmath3 .",
    "immigrants ( @xmath4 ) are born at the origin @xmath5 according to a homogeneous poisson process with intensity @xmath6 .",
    "each particle lives for some random time @xmath7 and then transforms ( splits ) into a random number @xmath8 of particles of the next generation . the probability laws of the lifetime @xmath7 and branching @xmath8 are rank- , time- , and space - independent .",
    "new particles are born at the location of their parent at the moment of splitting .",
    "the lifetime distribution is exponential : @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the conditional probability that a particle transforms into @xmath11 new particles ( 0 means that it disappears ) given that the transformation took place is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the probability generating function for the number @xmath8 of new particles is thus [ branching_pgf ] h(s ) = _",
    "the expected number of offsprings ( also called the _ branching number _ ) is @xmath13 ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "each particle diffuses in @xmath0 independently of other particles .",
    "this means that the density @xmath14 of a particle that was born at instant @xmath15 at point @xmath16 solves the equation = d(_i ) p d _ p [ diffusion ] with the initial condition @xmath17 .",
    "the solution of ( [ diffusion ] ) is given by p(*x , y*,t)= ( 4dt)^-n/2 \\{- } , [ sol ] where @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce particle _ rank _",
    "@xmath19 for an arbitrary integer @xmath20 and thus consider particles of ranks @xmath21 .",
    "this reflects our focus on direct cascading , which often assumes that particles with larger size ( _ e.g. _ , length , volume , mass , energy , momentum , _ etc .",
    "_ ) split into smaller ones according to an appropriate conservation law .",

[ gamma ] for the purely exponential rank distribution , @xmath56 , the value of @xmath57 is independent of @xmath35 and @xmath58 ; while deviations from the pure exponent will cause @xmath59 to vary as a function of @xmath35 and/or @xmath58 . combining and we find _",

    "the same behavior is in fact observed for @xmath67 ( the details will be published elsewhere ) .",
    "in addition , for @xmath67 the ratios @xmath61 do not merely deviate from @xmath68 , but diverge to infinity at the origin .",
    "away from the origin , according to eq .  , we have @xmath69 , which implies _ downward deviations _ from the pure exponent : for the same number of rank @xmath63 particles , the number of rank @xmath66 particles is smaller than predicted by .     of generation @xmath35 particles at distance @xmath70 from the origin ( cf .",

    "one can clearly see the transition from downward to upward deviation of the rank distributions from the pure exponential form as we approach the origin . ]",
    "motivation for this work is the problem of prediction of extreme events in complex systems .",
    "our point of departure is a classical model of spatially distributed population of particles of different ranks governed by direct cascade of branching and external driving . in the probability theory this model",
    "is known as the age - dependent multi - type branching diffusion process with immigration @xcite .",
    "we introduce here a new approach to the study of this process .",
    "we assume that observations are only possible on a subspace of the system phase space while the source of external driving remains unobservable .",
    "the natural question under this approach is the dependence of size - distributions of particles on the distance to the source .",
    "the complete analytical solution to this problem is given by the proposition  [ prop_f ] .",
    "it is natural to consider rank as a logarithmic measure of the particle size .",
    "if we assume a size - conservation law in the model , the exponential rank distriburtion derived in corresponds to a self - similar , power - law distribution of particle sizes , characteristic for many complex systems .",
    "thus , the proposition  [ gammalim ] describes space - dependent deviations from the self - similarity ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_ak ] ) ; in particular , deviations premonitory to an extreme event .",
    "the numerical experiments ( that will be published elsewhere ) confirm the validity of our analytical results and asymptotics in a finite model .",
    "the model studied here exhibits very rich and intriguing premonitory behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig_example ] shows several 2d snapshots of a 3d model at different distances from the source .",
    "one can see that , as the source approaches , the following changes in the background activity emerge : a ) the intensity ( total number of particles ) increases ; b ) particles of larger size become relatively more numerous ; c ) particle clustering becomes more prominent ; d ) the correlation radius increases ; e ) coherent structures emerge .",
    "in other words , the model exhibits a broad set of premonitory phenomena previously observed heuristically in real and modeled systems : multiple fracturing @xcite , seismicity @xcite , socio - economics @xcite , percolation @xcite , hydrodynamics , hierarchical models of extreme event development @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are at the heart of earthquake prediction algorithms well validated during 20 years of forward world - wide tests ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyse only the first - moment properties of the system ; such properties can explain the premonitory intensity increase ( item a above ) and transformation of the particle rank distribution ( item b ) . at the same time , the framework developed here allows one to quantitatively analyze other premonitory phenomena ; this can be readily done by considering the higher - moment properties .",
