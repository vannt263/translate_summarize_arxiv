    "the magnetic field in the solar corona and the inner solar wind is very important because it controls the structure and dynamics of the coronal plasma .",
    "unfortunately it is very difficult to measure the magnetic field in this region directly .",
    "optical observations can be made in the photosphere , and these can be extrapolated outwards into the corona @xcite , but such extrapolations do not agree well with estimates made by extrapolating inwards space - craft measurements at mercury @xcite .",
    "it is possible to estimate the magnetic field in the quiet solar wind by measuring the faraday rotation of linearly polarized radio waves propagating through the region of interest .",
    "thus a good deal of work has been done using the faraday rotation technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the faraday rotation of the position angle of the linear polarization ( in cgs units ) is given by @xmath1 .\\ ] ] the magnetic field of the inner corona is dominated by closed loops over active regions and open field lines over coronal holes @xcite .",
    "closed loops seldom extend past 2 - 3 @xmath0 and the magnetic field , as defined by bright striations in white light observations , appears to be radial outside of this distance @xcite . at larger distances a tangential component builds up due to rotation of the sun ( hundhausen , 1972 ) , but in the regions of interest for faraday rotation observations",
    "the magnetic field is predominantly radial .",
    "this has an important consequence for faraday rotation observations .",
    "if the corona were spherically symmetric the sign of @xmath2 would reverse at the closest point of approach and the faraday rotation would approach zero .",
    "so one can not use the simple model of a spherically symmetric solar wind - faraday rotation is a measure of the deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "a further problem with interpreting faraday rotation observations is that the electron density must be known .",
    "fortunately the electron density can be measured by several methods and its average behavior is reasonably well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however it is time variable , and the path integration must be modeled carefully to obtain reliable estimates of the magnetic field .    with a pulsar",
    "one can also measure the group delay of the pulse passing through the solar wind .",
    "this is given by @xmath3.\\ ] ] we will show that this constraint is very valuable because it allows us to estimate the ratio ( f ) of the instantaneous electron density @xmath4 to the average @xmath5 . in our observations",
    "this factor lay in the range @xmath6 .",
    "correction of the magnetic field estimate by this factor is a significant improvement .",
    "however the group delay due to the solar wind is small and can not be measured with sufficient accuracy for most pulsars .",
    "fortunately the class of pulsars with millisecond periods ( msps ) has very high rotational stability and can be timed with a precision of the order of 100 ns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is sufficient to measure the solar wind contribution @xcite .",
    "simultaneous measurements of faraday rotation and group delay can also be performed with suitably equipped spacecraft and such measurements have been very useful , but they not been possible since the helios probes which worked up to 1985 @xcite .    coronal modeling can be done most reliably near solar minimum when the magnetic field structure is relatively simple and stable . at this phase of the solar activity cycle",
    "it can be characterized by a `` magnetic pole '' which may be displaced from the rotational pole .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be radial everywhere ( and decreases with distance like @xmath7 to conserve flux ) but is opposite in the opposite hemispheres .",
    "thus the magnetic equator is a current - sheet where the field reverses .",
    "the current sheet appears above and below the rotational equator as the sun rotates .",
    "the solar wind velocity is low and the electron density is high in a belt of about @xmath8 around the current sheet .",
    "however , the magnitude of the magnetic field is roughly the same in the fast and slow wind .",
    "figure [ fg : track ] shows the location of the current sheet and the slow wind belt during one of our observations . here",
    "the current sheet , as estimated using the wilcox solar observatory ( wso ) data , is shown as a heavy solid line and the slow wind belt is bounded by dash - dotted lines .",
    "points on the line of sight from the earth to the pulsar at the time of observation are shown as a line of dots for which the spacing is 5@xmath9 subtended at the sun .",
    "one can see that the line of sight crosses the current sheet twice between the earth and the closest point of approach and it passes through two different low and high density regions .",
    "thus there is a current sheet at the magnetic equator where the field reverses .",
    "is shown as a heavy solid line .",
    "the location of the slow wind belt ( @xmath8 about the current sheet ) is indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the path to psr j1022 + 1001 on 2006 aug 25 at 00:20 ut has been extrapolated back to the source surface along the streamlines assuming radial flow and a velocity of 400 km / s .",
    "the source - surface point corresponding to the point of closest approach to the sun along the line of sight is indicated by a triangle and that corresponding to the earth position by @xmath10 . the furthest point from the earth which is shown",
    "subtends an angle of 85@xmath9 at the sun.,title=\"fig:\",width=302][fg : track ]    however the location of the current sheet is subject to some error because a current - free potential - field model was used to extrapolate the photospheric observations of the wso into the corona .",
    "also the width of the slow wind belt is not well - defined and the density may vary with time . in this work",
    "we are concerned with the effect of these modeling errors on the final magnetic field estimate , and how these can be reduced using the additional constraint provided by a simultaneous group delay measurement .",
    "this was suggested by @xcite , but they were unable to measure the group delay with sufficient accuracy in their observations .",
    "we do not have enough measurements to make a strong statement about the magnetic field of the solar wind , other than to show consistency with other measurements , but we have sufficient data to show the modeling errors one can expect and to compare them with statistical errors . in the following sections we will discuss : the observations and the primary analysis ; the coronal model and the fitting process ; the magnetic fields estimates and their sensitivity to model errors ; and the prospects for future such observations .",
    "the observations were part of the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project which commenced in 2004 and has made observations of 20 msps at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks since then @xcite .",
    "here we restrict our analysis to the pulsar which provides the best observations for our purpose , psr j1022@xmath111001 which has ecliptic latitude @xmath12 , but two other msps regularly observed with the ppta , j1730@xmath132304 ( @xmath14 ) and j1824@xmath132452 ( @xmath15 ) are potentially useful .",
    "the observations analysed are those when the line of sight to psr j1022@xmath111001 happened to be close to the sun - they were not deliberately scheduled to be near the sun . as a result",
    "there are few observations useful for this work .",
    "all observations use the center beam of the parkes 20-cm multibeam receiver @xcite at frequencies close to 1400mhz .",
    "all of the data were recorded in full - polarization mode .",
    "the back - end signal processing systems are parkes digital filter bank systems ( pdfb1 to pdfb4 ) .",
    "each observation has a total bandwidth of 256mhz with 1024 channels .",
    "the duration of each observation is 64 minutes and the data were averaged with 1-min sub - integrations .",
    "a 2-min pulsed calibration signal was recorded before each pulsar observation .",
    "the flux density scale was set using observations of hydra a. the cross - coupling between feed probes was measured using observations of psr j0437@xmath134715 covering a wide range of hour angles .",
    "the primary analysis was done using psrchive software @xcite .",
    "initially , 5% of the band edges and radio frequency interference ( rfi ) were automatically removed .",
    "then the data were flux- and polarization - calibrated and the cross - coupling between the feed polarizations was corrected using the pac / pcm algorithm in psrchive . in pulsar analysis",
    "the group delay is quantified by the `` dispersion measure '' dm which is the path integrated electron density in pc @xmath16 .",
    "the faraday rotation is quantified by the `` rotation measure '' rm , which is the term in square brackets in equation 1 in units of rad m@xmath17 .",
    "we will use these measures in our further discussion .",
    "the method of obtaining rm is similar to that discussed in @xcite .",
    "we approached the final result with a series of three successive approximations .",
    "we first adjusted the rm to optimize the linearly polarized intensity integrated over the bandwidth .",
    "then we separated each observation into upper and lower halves of the total band . an improved value of rm was determined using the weighted mean of position angle difference between the two halves of the band for each pulse phase bin .",
    "the rm also includes a time variable ionospheric component .",
    "we corrected it using an ionospheric model which is encoded in 2007 international reference ionophere ( iri ) model .",
    "it was relatively small , ranging from @xmath130.45 to @xmath132.25radm@xmath17 , but not negligible .    to obtain the final approximation to rm we used the corrected position angle vs pulse phase measured far from the sun by @xcite as a reference template .",
    "we then found a weighted average of the differences of each observation near the sun to this reference template .",
    "the normalized chi - squared of these weighted averages was typically about 1.3 , indicating that the error estimates used in the weighted fit were reasonably accurate and the position - angle template was a good model when the pulsar was near the sun .",
    "to estimate the dm contribution from the solar wind , we used a simpler procedure .",
    "the dm variations due to the interstellar medium for psr j1022@xmath111001 are smaller than the measurement error @xcite .",
    "so we simply estimated pulse arrival times in the normal way , by fitting a detailed timing model to the entire set of observations , excluding those near the sun .",
    "we then obtained dm@xmath18 by comparing the observed timing residual near the sun with this distant average .",
    "there is a contribution from the ionosphere but , unlike the rm contribution , the ionospheric dm contribution is negligible compared with the measurement error .    the final rm and dm measurements used are summarized in table [ tb : obs ] and plotted in figure [ fg : rmdm ] vs distance from the sun .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have identified four primary contributions to the error on magnetic field estimates made using the faraday rotation technique . in order of importance",
    "these are : failure to correct for dm variations ( @xmath1950% ) ; inaccuracy of estimation of the current sheet location ( @xmath1925% ) ; error in the dm measurement ( @xmath1915% ) ; and error in the faraday rotation estimate ( @xmath191% ) .",
    "thus use of simultaneous dm observations can roughly double the precision of the magnetic field estimates .",
    "the value of the ppta for such measurements is clear .",
    "it provides a good timing model for the dm far from the sun and a good template for the position - angle variations far from the sun .",
    "we have plotted our estimates of @xmath20 along with those of other authors in figure [ fg : mag ] .",
    "the estimates of @xcite and @xcite are not plotted because in both cases the authors only provide a measurement of the average line - of - sight component of the magnetic field and do not attempt to estimate @xmath20 .",
    "their estimates of the average line - of - sight components are consistent with other observations but do not put a useful constraint on @xmath20 .",
    "our estimates of @xmath20 are somewhat lower than the others , but are consistent with them , within the error bars .",
    "all the observations are broadly consistent with the helios space craft measurements and an extrapolation like @xmath7 . thus our measurements , although few in number , confirm the very important result that the potential field models of the corona seriously underestimate the magnitude of the magnetic field for @xmath21 .",
    "are plotted as * symbols with error bars .",
    "the extrapolated helios measurements are a solid line @xcite , an average of the @xcite observations ( @xmath22 mg ) are a dot - dashed line and the observations of @xcite are + symbols connected by a dashed line .",
    "the observation of @xcite is an open box and the range given by @xcite is a pair of connected x symbols .",
    ", width=340 ]    we did not observe any transients near the sun and would not have been able to analyze them with the technique we used .",
    "however it might be possible to do so if sufficient additional information , such as might be provided by stereo , were available to constrain the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "we note that faraday rotation is capable of 1% precision by itself , and one might be able to measure rapid variations of magnetic field during transients with this accuracy .",
    "we believe that more extensive observations of psrs j1022@xmath111001 , j1730@xmath132304 , and j1824@xmath132452 near the sun , perhaps involving more telescopes to provide continuous coverage during the closest approach , would be valuable and should be undertaken at the next opportunity .",
    "there are five additional msps with ecliptic latitudes @xmath23 that may be suitable for precision timing : j0030@xmath110451 ; j1614@xmath132230 ; j1721@xmath132457 ; j1802@xmath132124 ; and j1811@xmath1324 .",
    "preliminary observations would be required to confirm that these are `` good timers '' before undertaking coronal measurements .",
    "the cluster of pulsars with a right ascension close to 18:00 would facilitate an intensive observing program in the last two weeks of december each year , but there are insufficient msps to monitor the corona on a regular basis .",
