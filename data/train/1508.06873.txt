    "although in real graphene a ( quantized ) non - zero minimum conductivity has been found at the dirac point  @xcite , the effect seen in our results is unrelated to this , being of a larger order of magnitude ( the metallic phase extends up to site disorder of strength @xmath152 ) .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : dos ] , the random so couplings used in the model investigated in sec .  [ sec : mi - prg ] account for the significant departure from zero of the dos close to @xmath73 .",
