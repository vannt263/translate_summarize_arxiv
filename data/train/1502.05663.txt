    "as it is well known , nonlinear theories of electromagnetism exhibit birefringence phenomenon .",
    "the most popular example appears in the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) where polarization effects are activated in the limit of large fields ( @xmath1 ) , inducing an effective optical axis in the vacuum .",
    "in such situation , a light ray is expected to split in two rays propagating with different velocities @xcite .",
    "an experimental setup designed to measure the birefringent properties of the qed vacuum was long ago proposed @xcite",
    ". however , direct measurements of this effect are not yet conclusive and are still under consideration @xcite .",
    "the influence of the nontrivial vacua on the propagation of electromagnetic waves was discussed in several distinct physical configurations @xcite .",
    "conditions for the occurrence of birefringence of gluon fields was also studied @xcite . in the context of material media , birefringence effects are expect to occur in several distinct situations .",
    "it occurs naturally , for instance in certain crystals presenting optical axes @xcite , or artificially when optical axes are induced by means of external applied electromagnetic fields @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "birefringent materials and methods including this effect have been incorporated in several technological devices @xcite .",
    "birefringence is also a powerful optical tool to investigate properties of new materials , biological systems and others @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "trirefringence was only recently considered as a possible phenomenon in material media .",
    "it was measured @xcite in tailored photonic crystals @xcite , and the theoretical description of this effect in media characterized by effective dielectric coefficients was proposed @xcite . in this case",
    "@xcite , only when some of the dielectric coefficients are negative , could trirefringence take place .",
    "metamaterials @xcite seem to be good candidates for supporting this effect , due to the controllability of their dielectric tensors . with the present day technology of producing such new media ,",
    "it is expected that trirefringence will play some important role in technology of optical systems , as birefringence has done .",
    "usually , effects occurring in the realm of maxwell electromagnetism in material media are expected to occur in the realm of nonlinear electromagnetic theories .",
    "it is possible to build up analogue models between these two domains where the coefficients describing a specific dielectric medium are mapped as derivatives of the lagrangian density describing a nonlinear theory . in this way , trirefringence should also be a possible effect in nonlinear electromagnetism . by deriving and using the general description for wave propagation in the limit of geometrical optics , in this paper",
    "we show that trirefringence is in fact a possible effect in nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "it is not our purpose to set the general conditions a model must fulfill in order to present trirefringence , but only to show the effect as a possible one in the domain of nonlinear electromagnetism .",
    "a particular model is thus investigated where such phenomenon is shown to occur provided that convenient external fields are set .",
    "the phase and group velocities of the waves are derived , as well as the corresponding polarization vectors .",
    "a numerical example is graphically studied .",
    "the model examined in the paper corresponds to the effective lagrangian density for qed in the regime of large fields .",
    "the trirefringence phenomenon is shown to occur whenever the model applies , although its measurability requires the control of very large fields . a possible arena to search for this effect could be the special fluids recently produced by high energy collisions , as addressed later in the concluding section .",
    "further , this model is also useful in the context of analogue models in material media , where the predicted effect could be tested on optical systems , for instance in metamaterials .    in the next section , nonlinear electromagnetism",

    "( [ gym4 ] ) .",

    "multirefringence phenomena could also be found for systems described by nonlinear lagrangian densities which depend on non - abelian gauge fields . in such cases ,",
    "the field strength tensors would not be gauge - invariant .",
    "nevertheless , it can be easily shown that the propagation of the field disturbances would be described by the same equations presented above , since only second - order derivatives of the gauge vector field may present non - zero hadamard discontinuities . the nonlinear model discussed in the text",
    "was proposed long ago @xcite as the effective lagrangian of quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) or other yang - mills theories with non - trivial vacuum properties . when considered for this purpose , the lorentz invariant parameter @xmath7 in @xmath137",
