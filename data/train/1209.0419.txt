    "the goal of this work is to investigate the concept of `` effective free surfaces '' which are defined here as stationary interfaces corresponding to the time  averaged balance of mass , momentum and , if applicable , energy in a time  dependent flow with free surfaces .",
    "in other words , given an unsteady two  phase flow with fluctuating boundaries , the effective free surface represents the boundary between the two phases in the corresponding mean flow which satisfies the time  averaged form of the original system of governing equations subject to a number of modeling assumptions .",
    "the motivation for this work comes from the field of flow control @xcite where many emerging applications involve control and optimization of free  surface phenomena .",
    "the particular applications underlying this research concern optimization of complex thermo  fluid phenomena occurring in liquid metals during welding , see volkov _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "while the mathematical foundations for the optimal control of time  dependent free  boundary problems are relatively well understood @xcite , such approaches tend to result in computational problems of significant complexity even for simple models @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty arising when methods of the optimal control , or more broadly , the calculus of variations are applied to such problems is that some of the optimality conditions have the form of partial differential equations ( pdes ) defined on interfaces which evolve with time .",
    "needless to say , such problems tend to be quite hard to solve for non  trivial applications . on the other hand , this framework becomes much more tractable when time _ independent _ free  boundary problems are considered instead @xcite .",
    "moreover , on a more practical level , fluid flows with free surfaces may generate `` subgrid  scale '' features which are particularly difficult to compute , and it is therefore desirable to account for their effect in the average balance of mass and momentum in a systematic manner . in this paper we propose and test a simple mathematical model , in the form of a system of coupled pdes of the free  boundary type , representing the time  averaged conservation of mass and momentum in a given time ",
    "dependent problem with free surfaces .",
    "while such averaging approaches are well  established in the study of turbulent flows in domains with fixed boundaries , giving rise to the well  known reynolds  averaged navier  stokes ( rans ) equations , see , e.g. , pope@xcite , the additional complication in the present problem is that one also needs to take into account the effect of the fluctuations of the location of the free surfaces on the average mass and momentum balance .",
    "our approach to this problem relies on a number of simplifying assumptions which are all clearly identified . in the spirit of the `` closure problem '' arising in turbulence modeling ,",
    "see ref .",
    ", in order to close the resulting system of equations one needs to express average products of fluctuating quantities in terms of average quantities .",
    "however , in contrast to the classical closure problem where the reynolds stresses are modeled with terms defined in the bulk of the fluid , in the present problem , subject to certain assumptions , such closure terms will appear in the boundary conditions defined on the effective free boundary .",
    "we will also discuss some very simple strategies for constructing such closures .",
    "the question of ensemble  averaged , or time  averaged , description of flows with interfaces has received some attention in the literature and we mention here the work of dopazo @xcite , hong & walker @xcite and brocchini & peregrine @xcite which also contains references to a number of earlier attempts .",
    "these problems were recently revisited in the context of the derivation and validation of suitable models for multiphase reynolds  averaged navier  stokes ( rans ) equations@xcite and large eddy simulation ( les ) @xcite .",
    "we also mention the recent investigation by wacawczyk & oberlack@xcite where a number of closure strategies were proposed for this type of flows . finally , we add that the related question of homogenization of free  boundary problems is an emerging topic in the mathematical analysis of pdes , see , e.g. , schweizer @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of various computational methods applied to multiphase flows can be found in the monograph by prosperetti & tryggvason @xcite . as compared to these earlier studies , novel aspects of the present investigation",
    "are that , first , we want to compute steady  state solutions , which is motivated by the optimization applications mentioned above , and secondly , we want our averaged flows to feature _ sharp _ effective surfaces , so that the free  boundary property of the original problem is preserved in its averaged version .",
    "in contrast , we note that the formulations developed in refs .   and lead to interfaces , referred to as `` surface layers '' , characterized by finite thickness .",
    "we also wish to highlight that although brocchini & peregrine @xcite derived averaged equations taking into account the fluctuations of the free boundaries and also proposed a simple closure model , to the best of our knowledge , there have been no attempts to actually compute such solutions for nontrivial problems which is one of the contributions of the present work .",
    "the resulting system of pdes represents the averaged balance of mass and momentum which has the form of a steady  state free  boundary problem .",
    "since such problems tend to be difficult to solve numerically , we also propose a solution approach based on shape optimization which is well adapted to the numerical solution of this class of problems . in order to test our approach",
    "we choose a very simple model problem which , while allowing us to focus on certain methodological aspects , still captures some essential features of the motivating application , namely , the transfer of mass and momentum to the weld pool via droplets , see figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "this model describes the two  dimensional ( 2d ) , time ",
    "periodic impingement of droplets on the free surface of the fluid in a container . in view of the comments made above",
    ", we see that formulation of an optimal control problem for the original time ",
    "dependent system would require us to satisfy certain optimality conditions on the boundary of each individual moving droplet in addition to conditions on the free surface of the liquid in the pool .",
    "on the other hand , the concept of the effective free surface allows us to replace this optimization problem with a simpler one , which is also computationally more tractable , where the optimality conditions have to be imposed on the stationary effective surfaces .",
    "thus , as one application , the proposed approach will allow us to extend the optimization formulation developed in volkov _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite to include the effect of the mass transfer into the weld pool via droplet impingement .",
    "we remark that droplet impingement onto a thin liquid film is a phenomenon with manifold manifestations in technology , including chocolate processing , spray painting , corrosion of turbine blades , fuel injection in internal combustion engines , and aircraft icing .",
    "it also occurs in many natural phenomena such as the erosion of soil and the dispersal of spores and micro - organisms .",
    "a considerable amount of literature is available as concerns the numerical modeling of droplet impingement onto a solid surface .",
    "harlow & shannon @xcite were the first to simulate this phenomenon and several other authors have applied the volume  of  fluid ( vof ) based approaches such as ripple @xcite and sola ",
    "vof @xcite to understand droplet impingement phenomena .",
    "_ @xcite also performed a numerical investigation and experimental characterization of the heat transfer from a periodic impingement of droplets .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the next section we present the formulation of the problem in general terms , in the following section we introduce our model problem and in section [ sec : efs_closure ] we discuss a very simple closure strategy which may be suitable for this problem , in section [ sec : efs_steady ] we introduce a shape  optimization approach to the numerical solution of the resulting averaged equations , whereas in section [ sec : efs_results ] we present some computational results together with a discussion ; final conclusions are deferred to section [ sec : final ] and some technical results concerning solution of the shape optimization problem in section [ sec : efs_steady ] are collected in appendix [ sec : efs_grad ] .",

    "a number of different averaging techniques have been considered in the literature in regard to multiphase flows @xcite . here",
    "we will rely on the conventional time  averaging procedure , see monin & yaglom @xcite which is based on the ideas originally due to reynolds ( it should be added that in statistical physics averaging is typically performed with respect to realizations , however , in view of the ergodicity assumption adopted here , the ensemble average can be replaced with a time average used in below ) . given the quantity @xmath42 \\times",

    "we also note that the averaging operator @xmath51 commutes with differentiation with respect to the space variables @xcite .",
    "we shall furthermore assume that @xcite @xmath52    our derivation of the averaged equation follows the general development presented in hong & walker @xcite , although we use a somewhat different notation adapted to the present problem .",
    "we begin with continuity equation and decompose the dependent variables as in .",

    "we now turn our attention towards momentum equation . in order to simplify the formulation of the present problem we make the following    the fluctuations of viscosity",
    "@xmath60 $ ] and the interface curvature @xmath22 , cf .",
    ", are neglected .",
    "these quantities will be therefore treated as constant and will not be subject to averaging .",
    "[ assume1a ]",
    "the reason for this simplification is that proper handling of viscosity and curvature fluctuations leads to significant complications in the resulting average equations , and this issue is deferred to future research . in a phenomenon characterized by an interplay of capillary , viscous and inertial effects , assumption [ assume1a ] implies that the applicability of the model is restricted to flow regimes dominated by the inertial effects .",
    "indeed , we expect that the density fluctuations are going to have a dominating influence on the effective surfaces in the class of applications motivating this study .",
    "the development of the reynolds  averaged form of the momentum equations proceeds most easily when the nonlinear advection terms are written in the conservative form .",
    "again , at every point @xmath61 we replace the dependent variables with relations and then average the equations over time .",
    "the complete reynolds  averaged momentum equation can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the usual viscous stress tensor defined in terms of the averaged velocity field and , in addition to the reynolds stresses , on the rhs in we also note the presence of new terms representing fluctuations of the free boundaries .",
    "the main idea behind the proposed approach is that the resulting averaged solutions should preserve some essential features of the original time ",
    "dependent free  boundary problem  , namely , a sharp separation between the two phases , cf .",

    "such smoothly varying indicator functions @xmath66 correspond to a continuous transition between the two phases without a well  defined interface .",

    "figure [ fig : domains ] . from the point of view of the formulation of a computation  oriented model",
    "it is therefore not `` economical '' to introduce new terms into the averaged equations which would be nonzero only in a very small fraction of the domain .",
    "we therefore propose the following simplifying approach in which the averaged fluctuation terms involving tensors @xmath72 and @xmath73 defined in the bulk are approximated with suitable terms defined on the effective boundary @xmath85 .",
    "this can be done by integrating the terms involving @xmath72 and @xmath73 in  over their support @xmath86 and then using the divergence theorem ( in principle , the supports of these two terms may in general be different , but for the sake of simplicity we assume here that they coincide ; this simplification does not in any way affect the accuracy of the proposed approach ) .",
