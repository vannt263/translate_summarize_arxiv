    "holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) is the idea that quantum information processing can be performed by means of non - abelian geometric phases .",
    "it was first proposed @xcite for adiabatic holonomies @xcite , and subsequently generalized @xcite to nonadiabatic non - abelian geometric phases @xcite .",
    "an important feature of hqc is the inherent robustness of geometric phases under fluctuations of the path in state space @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of hqc is the removal of dynamical phase effects during the execution of the gate . in the nonadiabatic case , which is the focus of the present paper ,",
    "this is acheived in a three - level @xmath0 system , where the two levels encoding a qubit are coupled to an excited state by external field pulses .",
    "nonadiabatic hqc in this configuration has been realized experimentally for a superconducting artificial atom @xcite , nmr @xcite , and nv - centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-system - based hqc has been combined with decoherence free subspaces @xcite , noiseless subsystems @xcite , and dynamical decoupling @xcite .",
    "the nonadiabatic property makes it possible to shorten the exposure to undesired external influences @xcite .",
    "the essential geometric structure of nonadiabatic hqc is the complex grassmann manifold @xmath1 , i.e. , the space of @xmath2-dimensional subspaces of an @xmath3-dimensional state space @xcite .",
    "a loop in the grassmannian generates a holonomic quantum gate acting on the target computational subspace encoded at the common start- and end - point .    the @xmath0-system - based holonomic gates in ref .",
    "@xcite utilizes resonant laser pulses ( i.e. , vanishing detuning ) . here",
    ", two distinct loops in the corresponding grassmannian @xmath4 are needed to perform an arbitrary holonomic one - qubit gate .",
    "experimentally , the two loops correspond to two consecutive laser pulse pairs of arbitrary shape .",
    "the need for two loops in order to implement an arbitrary holonomic one - qubit gate is an apparent drawback as it doubles the exposure time to various error sources .",
    "this motivates attempts to try to reduce the number of loops .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that an arbitrary one - qubit gate can be achieved for a single loop by using off - resonant laser pulses . however",
    ", this off - resonant scheme works at the expense of restricting to square - shaped pulses , as well as having a small rotation angle limit corresponding to very short pulses , which lead to unstable gate operations .    here",
    ", we demonstrate that these problems can be resolved . to this end",
    ", we propose a single - loop multiple - pulse scheme , in which the loop is divided into segments .",
    "our scheme is conceptually akin to the ` orange slice ' path on the bloch sphere commonly used when observing the abelian geometric phase in quantum optics experiments @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to perform arbitrary holonomic one - qubit gates for shorter paths in the grassmannian than in the original scheme @xcite , while keeping the full flexibility concerning the choice of laser pulse shape and pulse duration .",
    "universal hqc can be achieved by combining our holonomic one - qubit gate with an entangling holonomic two - qubit gate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "next section reviews earlier versions of @xmath0-system - based holonomic gates .",
    "section [ sec : iterative ] outlines our single - loop multiple - pulse scheme , first by describing the general idea , and thereafter followed by a demonstration that an arbitrary holonomic one - qubit gate can be realized by dividing the loop into just two path segments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental ] , we delineate how our scheme can be implemented experimentally .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions .",
    "in the @xmath0-configuration , a laser pulse pair induces transitions between the qubit states @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the excited state @xmath7 of a generic three - level system .",
    "this is described by the hamiltonian ( we put @xmath8 from now on ) @xmath9 where we have used the rotating wave approximation in the interaction picture .",
    "the complex - valued ratio @xmath10 describes the relative amplitude and phase between the laser pulses ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , are detunings .",
    "holonomic quantum information processing in the @xmath0-system is implemented by applying the laser pulses simultaneously and on resonance @xcite . in other words , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 has nonvanishing support over the duration @xmath16 of the pulse pair .",
    "the time - independent @xmath17 are assumed to satisfy the normalization relation @xmath18 .    to see how these parameter choices implement a purely holonomic gate acting on @xmath19 , it is convenient first to express the hamiltonian in terms of the dark and bright states @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . one thereby finds @xmath22 which shows that the evolution can be understood as a rabi oscillations between @xmath23 and @xmath7 with frequency @xmath15 , while @xmath24 decouples from the system .",
    "the @xmath0-configuration in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 representations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdasystems ] .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbhamiltonian ] ) moves the qubit subspace @xmath19 in the full state space @xmath27 ; a process that can be viewed as a path in the grassmannian @xmath4 .",
    "each point along the path in @xmath28 is spanned by the vectors @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pulse area and @xmath31 is the time evolution operator . a full loop @xmath32 in the grassmannian",
    "is realized when @xmath33 .",
    "the transformation on the one - qubit subspace is purely holonomic ( i.e. , depends only on @xmath32 ) as the dynamical matrix elements @xmath34 , @xmath35 , all vanish for @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "explicitly , one finds @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a unit vector defined by @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the projection operator onto the target computational subspace encoding the qubit , and @xmath41 are the standard pauli operators expressed in the @xmath25 basis .",
    "the resulting unitary transformation @xmath42 is the holonomic one - qubit gate associated with the loop @xmath32 .",
    "the holonomy in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1pulse ] ) shows that a single pulse pair can only generate traceless one - qubit gates . to achieve arbitrary holonomic gates",
    ", it is necessary to apply two consecutive laser pulse pairs , each with pulse area @xmath43 .",
    "this corresponds to traversing two loops in the grassmannian . by assuming that the two pulse pairs generate loops @xmath32 and @xmath44 , characterized by laser parameters that correspond to unit vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the resulting composite holonomic transformation becomes @xmath47 which is an arbitrary su(2 ) transformation that rotates the qubit by an angle @xmath48 around the normal of the plane spanned by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the need for two loops is an apparent drawback as it doubles the exposure time to various error sources .",
    "thus , it is desirable to find methods that can realized holonomic one - qubit gates for a single loop in the grassmannian .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that off - resonant , equally detuned laser pulses can be used to implement arbitrary single - loop holonomic one - qubit gates .",
    "this is described by the hamiltonian @xmath49 with a trivial shift of the zero - point energy and @xmath50 is the detuning @xcite . in order to preserve the geometric character of the evolution , the hamiltonian needs to be commuting with itself during the pulse , which implies",
    "that @xmath15 must be square - shaped , i.e. , @xmath51 for @xmath52 and zero otherwise .",
    "the evolution becomes cyclic corresponding to a loop @xmath53 in the grassmannian if @xmath54 one finds @xmath55 where @xmath56 the gate @xmath57 is an arbitrary holonomic one - qubit gate as the rotation angle @xmath58 can be varied between @xmath59 and @xmath43 by increasing @xmath60 from @xmath59 to infinity . as a consistency check",
    ", we may note that @xmath57 reduces to @xmath42 in the @xmath61 limit .",
    "although @xmath57 covers all one - qubit gates , it suffers from two disadvantages : first , if @xmath62 , then the pulse must be square - shaped in order to preserve the geometric character of the gate , which is a practical limitation as full shape flexibility is an important feature needed to optimize robustness to different kinds of errors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; secondly , the small @xmath58 limit is achieved for large @xmath63 , corresponding to small @xmath16 , which is the time regime where counter - rotating terms start to violate the rotating wave approximation , making the gate highly unstable to small perturbations in the run - time @xcite . in the following section ,",
    "we demonstrate a multiple - pulse method to realize arbitrary single - loop holonomic one - qubit gates , which avoids these disadvantages .",
    "consider a path in @xmath4 divided into @xmath64 segments @xmath65 , generated by @xmath64 pulse pairs with pulse areas @xmath66 .",
    "[ fig : one_loop ] schematically depicts such a division when @xmath67 is a loop and @xmath68 .",
    "the process of dividing the path can be described as the following iterative procedure :    * the first path segment starts at the target computational subspace @xmath69 and is generated by the zero - detuned ( resonant ) hamiltonian @xmath70 , being identical to @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . *",
    "the initial point @xmath72 of the @xmath73th path segment coincides with the final point @xmath74 of the @xmath75th path segment , for @xmath76 . *",
    "the resonant hamiltonian driving the evolution along the @xmath73th path segment reads @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 the corresponding run - time . here , the basis transformation @xmath81 acts unitarily on the final subspace of the @xmath75th segment , which further implies that @xmath82 .",
    "the time - evolution operator along the @xmath73th path segment evaluated at pulse area @xmath83 , takes the form @xcite @xmath84 due to the @xmath0 structure of @xmath85 , it follows that the evolution of the computational subspace is purely geometric along all path segments .",
    "we thus find the holonomy @xcite @xmath86 by carefully choosing laser parameters so that @xmath67 forms a loop , @xmath87 is a unitary operator acting on @xmath19 . in such a case , @xmath87 is our one - qubit gate .",
    "we now demonstrate that two pulse pairs ( @xmath88 ) with @xmath89 are sufficient to construct an arbitrary holonomic one - qubit quantum gate by traversing a single loop in @xmath4 .",
    "our starting point is @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , where the two latter vectors span the target computational subspace . by directly evaluating the time evolution operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : timeevop ] ) at @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 which yields @xmath95 the next step is to find the vectors @xmath96 spanning the initial point of the second path segment @xmath97 .",
    "we can make a nontrivial choice of these vectors so that the final point of @xmath97 coincides with the initial point of @xmath98 , i.e. , so that @xmath99 forms a loop .",
    "the choice is @xmath100 as given by the basis transformation @xmath101 the resulting hamiltonian for the second pulse thus reads @xmath102 which generates the time evolution operator @xmath103 when evaluated at @xmath104 . by taking into account the explicit form of the bright state",
    ", we see that @xmath105 is equivalent to a shift of the two laser parameters @xmath17 by the same phase @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "consecutive application of @xmath108 and @xmath109 generate a loop @xmath99 in the grassmannian .",
    "thus , @xmath110 is unitary and constitutes the holonomic one - qubit quantum gate . by inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1stunitary ] ) and ( [ eq:2ndunitary ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : sequence ] ) , we obtain @xmath111 the factor @xmath112 is a global phase factor that can be ignored and @xmath113 corresponds to a rotation around @xmath45 by an angle @xmath114 .    the holonomic gate @xmath115 reaches all possible one - qubit transformations by separately varying the phase shift @xmath106 and the laser parameters @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast to the off - resonant scheme proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , our gate preserves its geometric character for any pulse shape , provided the two pulse pairs both have area @xmath116 .",
    "we further note that the rotation angle @xmath106 is independent of the duration of the pulses , which implies that the small angle limit is achievable without violating the rotating wave approximation .",
    "thus , we conclude that our holonomic one - qubit gate resolves the problems of the off - resonant scheme @xcite , still maintaining the single - loop advantage over the original proposal of ref .",
    "the @xmath88 holonomic gates can be implemented experimentally in electric dipole transitions generated by four appropriately phase - shifted laser pulses in a generic atomic three - level systems .",
    "the four laser pulses should be applied as two consecutive pairs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realization ] .",
    "the first pair is given by the oscillating electric fields @xmath117 , @xmath12 , @xmath118 being the envelope function describing the common shape and duration of the pulses .",
    "similarly , the second pulse pair is given by @xmath119 and should not overlap with the first pulse pair ( thus , @xmath118 and @xmath120 should be mutually nonoverlapping , but have the same shape ) .",
    "the polarization @xmath121 is chosen so as to allow for the @xmath122 transition only , by utilizing appropriate selection rules .",
    "the ratio @xmath123 describes the relative intensity of the two laser pulses .",
    "we assume that the oscillation frequencies @xmath124 are tuned on resonance with the transition frequencies @xmath125 , given by the bare hamiltonian @xmath126 , for which the energy of the excited state is taken as zero - point .",

    "( [ eq : l2gate ] ) can be realized in this physical setting .",
    "we note that the phase shift @xmath106 has only physical significance as a relative phase shift between the two pulse pairs . in other words , if the same phase shift had been applied in the original single - loop scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , no physical effect would have been seen .",
    "in fact , the only parameters that matters for the evolution in the original scheme are the pulse area and the ratio @xmath138 , where the latter is clearly unchanged under the phase shift @xmath139 .",
    "nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation can be implemented by tailoring amplitude , phase , and area of laser pulses driving a @xmath0-systems . here , we have proposed a single - loop multiple - pulse scheme that implements holonomic gates in this system .",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that the simplest nontrivial case corresponding to two pulse pairs ( @xmath88 ) is sufficient to realize an arbitrary single - loop one - qubit gate . by combining our one - qubit gate with an entangling holonomic two - qubit gate , an efficient universal set of holonomic gates",
    "can be realized .",
    "our scheme avoids the drawbacks of earlier versions of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation .",
    "it minimizes the exposure time to errors , but keeps the full flexibility concerning the choice of laser pulse shape and pulse duration .",
    "we have further outlined an experimental setting involving a combination of carefully chosen laser pulses .",
    "we note that the @xmath88 gates involve control of two new parameters : the phase shift @xmath106 and an additional pulse area .",
    "thus , an optimal strategy uses the multiple - pulse one - loop scheme only to implement one - qubit gates with nonvanising trace ( such as phase shifts ) ; for gates with vanishing trace ( such as bit flip and hadamard ) the original @xmath43 scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite is preferable .",
    "the @xmath88 case can be extended to any numbers of pulse pairs .",
    "the resulting paths would explore larger regions of the underlying grassmann manifold @xmath4 and may therefore provide further insights into the geometrical structure of the @xmath4 holonomy .",
