    "it is worth mentioning that since the rotation is an invertible operation , joint 4d demodulation is still possible after the rotation . for complexity reasons , however , we perform hard decision on each 2d soft symbol using simple straight - line decision boundaries as shown in the figure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] , a qualitative comparison of the two different rotation schemes corresponding to pm - det1 and pm - det2 is shown .",

    "however , it should be mentioned that the receiver structure shown in fig .",
