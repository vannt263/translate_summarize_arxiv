    "one of the most relevant milestones in solid state physics has been undoubtedly the discovery of the high superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath6 ) in labacuo ceramics , prompting an intense activity in the field of synthesis and characterisation of copper oxide materials ( cuprates )  @xcite .",
    "the chemical composition of cuprates is well characterised by a layered crystal structure with one or more cuo@xmath8 planes per unit cell , which are responsible for the low lying electronic structure , and also presumably , the key for understanding the quasiparticle properties involved in the mechanism of superconductivity , i.e. : the origin of the coupling mode which binds two electrons ( holes ) in the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "nevertheless , despite over two decades of experimental and theoretical efforts to elucidate the pairing mechanism and to understand the many - body properties influencing the electron dynamics in cuprate superconductors , there is no consensus on the strength of the electron correlations and the nature of the boson coupling modes .",
    "nowadays , with the advent of improvement in instrumental resolution , sample quality , as well as theoretical development , the relevance of electron - boson coupling mechanisms on the electronic dynamics of cuprates is more and more accepted , because the many body effects are supposed to be particularly strong  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will review recent progress in the understanding of electrons interacting with bosonic modes , such as phonons , and discuss the results of recent high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes ) on cuprate superconductors with the aim of studying its possible connection with the occurrence of high-@xmath6 . in order to understand the relevance of the arpes technique , we recall that the photoemission process results in both an excited photoelectron and a photohole in the final state . related to this observation",
    ", it becomes a useful probe of the related scattering mechanisms contributing to the electrical transport in different materials .",
    "unlike other probes of the transport properties , the arpes technique has the advantage of momentum resolving . along this line , we want to note that the single - particle scattering rate measured in arpes is not identical to the scattering rate measured in transport studies themselves .",
    "nonetheless , direct proportionality between them has been established  @xcite . in conventional metals",
    ", the phonon coupling mode has long been recognised as the main mechanism involved in the superconducting properties , and the strength of this interaction essentially determines the value of @xmath6 . on the other hand , in the high - temperature superconductors ( htsc )",
    "the experimentally determined @xmath9wave pairing introduces considerable complications in the theory even when other coupling modes are considered  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , with the appearance of a new era of analysers with improved resolution both in energy and momentum , in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) as well as in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and x - ray scattering ( ixs ) experiments , the controversy on the influence of the anisotropic character of the superconducting gap in the electron properties can be avoided , by analysing preferential directions within the @xmath10 planes or nodal directions .",
    "this provides a smart solution if one is merely interested in identifying the energy modes  @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the most telling manifestations of the electron - phonon coupling is a mass renormalisation of the electronic dispersion at the energy scale associated with the phonons .",
    "this renormalisation effect is directly observable in the arpes measurements as a low - energy excitation band in the dispersion curves of photoemitted electrons , known as _ kink _  @xcite .",
    "this feature , so far universal in htsc , has been regarded as a signature of the strength of the boson mechanism which causes the pair formation in the superconducting state .",
    "in fact , all the interactions of the electrons which are responsible for the unusual normal and superconducting properties of cuprates are believed to be represented in this anomaly  @xcite .",
    "this has prompted an intense debate about the nature of the coupling mode involved in the density of low - energy electronic excited states in the momentum - energy space of cuprates , and its influence on the emergence of the superconducting state  @xcite .",
    "so far , the origin of high - temperature superconductivity and the nature of the bosons involved remains controversial mainly because experiments can only be used to determine an approximate energy of the mode and this energy is close to both the optical phonons @xcite and magnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "related to this , the energy scales of the optical phonons in the @xmath11 planes are similar for electron and hole doped cuprates , while the magnetic mode for electron doped htsc is found to be much smaller  @xcite . along this line , recently s. r. park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the magnetic resonance mode can not explain the arpes spectra in several electron doped htsc systems showing a clear support for the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "in addition , j. graf _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently reported the first evidence of an anomalous dispersion of the cu - o bond stretching phonon mode in a bi cuprate supporting the idea that strong electron energy dispersion measured by arpes corresponds to the cu - o bond stretching phonon mode . on the other hand , considering that the magnetic resonance has not been detected in the single layer bi2201",
    "@xcite , magnetic modes should be ruled out as a general mechanism within a controllable theory of strong correlations . in an effort to clarify the influence of the phonon coupling mode ( either weak or strong ) , in this work we are going to analyse the influence of the so - called electron - phonon coupling parameter on the electronic dispersion relations in several cuprate compounds .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_1 ] , we put forward some details about the conventional electron - phonon coupling theory focusing on the determination of the complex electron self - energy , and evaluating the influence of the electron - phonon spectral density calculated by different methods available in the literature on the superconducting properties of some cuprates ( e.g. , lsco , ybco , bscco ) .",
    "we concentrate on the use of approximate formulas to determine the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 , the ratio gap @xmath7 , and the zero temperature gap @xmath12 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the underlying approximations is also focused on . in sec .",
    "[ sec_2 ] we present a systematic study on the influence of the electron - phonon coupling parameter in the electron quasiparticle dispersion relations unravelling possible new physics .",
    "comparison with the electronic dispersion curves measured by arpes at the nodal point will be emphasised for the three families of cuprates .",
    "an empirical equation is incorporated for determining @xmath0 from the doping level in lsco which may be of interest for other works .",
    "finally , sec.[sec : conclusions ] is devoted to discussing our results .",
    "the relevance of the electron - phonon coupling mechanism for the interpretation of the electron dynamics in htsc will be concluded .",
    "comparison with recent published material will be emphasised .",
    "the purpose of this section is a brief reexamination of the conventional theory for electron - phonon coupling in condensed matter , with the aim of obtaining an appropriate interpretation of the so - called spectral function .",
    "this will envisage to extract some general consequences and then , check them from the direct interpolation between theory and experiment .",
    "recall that , nowadays the simplest interpretation of microscopic superconductivity remains to be the bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer s @xcite theory ( bcs ) which is based on the condensation of pairs of electrons ( holes ) into a spin singlet induced by an isotropic electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the formation of pairs gives rise to an excitation energy gap @xmath13 in the electron density of states across the fermi level ( @xmath14 ) and its magnitude reflects the strength of the pairing interaction . in bcs",
    "the pairing function @xmath13 has an isotropic @xmath15-_wave _ symmetry , and the actual reduced gap value @xmath7 is used to classify a system as a weak- or strong coupling superconductor by comparison to the mean - field value 3.51 . a significant accumulation of microscopic information on the fine structure found in tunnelling experiments at voltages above the forbidden energy gap was the most direct proof of the electron - phonon interaction as the coupling mechanism for superconductivity in conventional metals .",
    "however , along with the confirmation of the bcs predictions , the experimental results also indicated deviations from the weak - coupling bcs theory through the detection of large gaps as compared to the mean - field value . for the new generation of htsc",
    "the detailed structure in the measured quasiparticle density of states , also revealed the need of one controllable strong - coupling theory .",
    "moreover , many of the new families of superconductors discovered after the appearance of the cuprate compounds also exhibit highly anisotropic gaps , and transport and magnetic properties that can not be directly explained by the simple bcs theory @xcite . at present",
    ", there is no consensus on the microscopical theory involved in the htsc materials and the influence of the pairing mechanism on the superconducting gap and the higher @xmath6 . nevertheless , assuming that the quasiparticle dynamics is governed by some electron - boson coupling which predominates both in the normal state properties and in the superconducting state , a wide number of properties can be satisfactorily explained @xcite .",
    "thus , having made these general considerations on the many - body problem underlying in the electron - phonon coupling theory , we are going to expose some technical aspects to be considered in the analysis of arpes data and their relation with the superconducting properties .      in the diagrammatic language , the above mentioned physical properties are formulated within the framework of the fermi - liquid theory , where electron - like quasiparticles populate bands in energy - momentum space up to the cut - off at the fermi energy .",
    "lattice vibrations couple to electrons because the displacements of atoms from their equilibrium positions alter the band dispersions , either lowering or raising the total electron quasiparticle energy .",
    "electron correlations are responsible of the formation of quasiparticles which are well defined near the fermi level . there",
    ", the so called vertex corrections can be a _",
    "priori _ neglected because these can be shown to be reduced by the ratio between the phonon frequency ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "in other words , the presence of strong electron correlations mediated by the electron - phonon interaction is avoided and the multi - phonon excitations are reduced to the single - loop approximation or migdal - eliashberg ( me ) approach ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ]  d ) . in ordinary metals ,",
    "this simple picture for the phonon - mediated interaction between electrons , or electron - phonon coupling , has long been known to be the pairing mechanism responsible for superconductivity . on the other hand , in the htsc",
    "it has been suggested that other collective excitation modes mediate the pairing since the superconducting transition temperatures @xmath6 are much higher than those of conventional superconductors .",
    "nonetheless we want to emphasise that the feasibility of the me approach in the htsc is an issue still open .",
    "in fact , the recent observation of similar renormalisation effects in the energy - momentum space of htsc has raised the hope that the mechanism of high-@xmath6 superconductivity may finally be resolved , thus reviving the interest on the diagrammatic approach @xcite .",
    "let us go into some more detail .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the solid can be evaluated from the thermal greens - function formalism where it is assumed that the electron - phonon interaction can be introduced by the relation @xmath18 with @xmath19 related to the bare electron energy , i.e. , the non - interacting electron green s function ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 standing for the so - called `` imaginary matsubara frequencies '' @xcite .",
    "technically , the lowest order feynman graph approximation for the electron phonon interaction can be defined on a set of orthonormal functions ( harmonic fermi surfaces ) that allow to consider the complexities of the @xmath9band electron structure and phonons from the `` angular '' and `` energy '' components of the phase space  @xcite , i.e. : @xmath22-space is represented in terms of its harmonic components @xmath23 .",
    "thus , in terms of this set @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electronic density states on the fermi surface , and the electron - phonon spectral density @xmath26 represents a measure of the effectiveness of the phonons of frequency @xmath27 in the scattering electrons from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . up to this point , only the harmonic approximation to the phonon propagator @xmath30 has been considered . nevertheless , we recall that the actual form of eq .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) is cumbersome , and requires of an accurate determination of the electron - phonon spectral density from theoretical ab - initio calculations of the band structure of the crystal .",
    "then , the me approach is invoked . in order , to simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) one assumes that it is possible to neglect the dependence on the energy surfaces ( @xmath31 ) of the @xmath32 function .",
    "this allows us to omit the processes , violating the born - oppenheimer adiabatic theorem contained within the high order graphs .",
    "this is the me `` approach '' .",
    "motivations for the use of this approach have been broadly discussed in the past ( see refs .",
    "@xcite & @xcite ) .",
    "so far , the self - energy has been described in the orthonormal space of `` fermi surface harmonics '' which is to be transformed in the phase - space under consideration for * k*-space rotations according to their irreducible representations of the point group of crystal .",
    "formally , this means that the spectral function @xmath33 is to be diagonal .",
    "it must be emphasised that this diagonal representation for the normal state will continue to hold in the superconducting state for the isotropic cooper pairing or @xmath15-_wave _ gap",
    ". however , other pairing schemes which break rotation symmetry are , in principle , possible .",
    "thus , taking advantage that the arpes measurements at the nodal direction , are not influenced by the anisotropy of the superconducting gap , we will refer to a ( nondirectional ) isotropic quasiparticle spectral density , defined as the double average over the fermi surface of the electron - phonon spectral density @xmath34 ; i.e. , @xmath35 where , @xmath36^{1/2}\\langle \\textbf{k}|\\hat{\\epsilon}^{\\ ; j}_{\\textbf{k}'\\textbf{k}}\\cdot\\nabla v|\\textbf{k}'\\rangle$ ] defines the matrix elements of electron - phonon interaction for electron scattering from @xmath37 to @xmath38 with a phonon of frequency @xmath39 ( j is a branch index ) .",
    "@xmath40 stands for the ion mass , @xmath41 is the crystal potential , @xmath42 is the polarisation vector , and @xmath25 represents the single - spin electronic density of states at the fermi surface . as usual @xmath43 denotes the dirac s delta function evaluated at @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , note that @xmath45 is inversely proportional to the number of charge carriers contributed by each atom of the crystal to the bosonic coupling mode .",
    "therefore , an increase in the doping level , which causes an increment in the hole concentration of the @xmath10 plane must be reflected in the coupling parameters as we will see in section  [ sec_2 ] . moreover , recalling the outstanding feature of the theory of metals , that @xmath45 vanishes linearly with @xmath46 when @xmath47 @xcite , one would expect a _ linear _ disappearance of the coupling effect that gives rise to the nodal kink in the vicinity of the fermi surface . on the other hand , inspired by recent results on the `` universality '' of the nodal fermi velocity @xmath48 ( at low energies ) in certain cuprates , a prominent role of this quantity",
    "is also expected .      here , we recall that relevant dynamical information is contained in the analytic continuation @xmath49 to points just above the real frequency axis , known as the `` retarded '' green s function  @xcite .",
    "one is therefore led to continue the electronic self - energy @xmath50 analytically by @xmath51 , where the bare electron band energy is determined by the poles of the green s function @xmath49 or the zeros of @xmath52 . assuming that a pole occurs near @xmath53",
    ", one gets    @xmath54-i\\sigma_{2}(k,\\omega)\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\;\\label{eq_4}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then , the pole of @xmath55 occurs at a frequency @xmath56 given by @xmath57 , with the quasiparticle scattering time defined by @xmath58 , and the electron dressed band energy @xmath59 by @xmath60 \\",
    "; .\\label{eq_5}%\\ ] ] now , as a manifestation of the electron - phonon coupling interaction one can introduce the mass renormalisation of the electronic dispersion at the energy scale associated with the phonons .",
    "this may be technically defined by a mass - enhancement parameter @xmath5 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath61    on the other hand , the strength of the electron - phonon interaction is commonly estimated from the so - called boson coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this dimensionless parameter is commonly defined in terms of the electron - phonon spectral density as @xmath62 and it will be eventually related to the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "we want to emphasise that this quantity is not to be straightforwardly identified with the mass - enhancement parameter @xmath5 and a necessary distinction between them is essential for the overall description of the available arpes data @xcite .",
    "in fact , as it was argued in that paper , equality would just be warranted at low temperatures and within the migdal - eliashberg approximation for the phonon coupling .",
    "electron - phonon spectral density @xmath63 for ( a ) @xmath1 ( lsco ) , ( b ) @xmath2 ( bscco ) , and ( c ) @xmath3 ( ybco ) , determined by different methods .",

    "@xcite , and the dotted line in ( b ) corresponds to the method of ref .  @xcite . in ( d )",
    "we shown a schematic picture of the migdal - eliashberg approach from the lowest order feynman diagram for the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the wavy line represents the phonon green s function @xmath64 , the double solid line is the renormalised electron green s function @xmath55 , and the shaded circles represent the small electron - phonon vertex corrections neglected in the me approach . ]    as one can easily appreciate , the spectral density function @xmath65 plays a fundamental role in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "since the electron - phonon interaction manifests itself not only in the electronic properties but also in phononic properties via the density of phonon states @xmath66 , the investigation of phonon spectra may provide valuable information on the strength and character of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the information about the phonon spectrum can be taken from the inversion of the eliashberg equations in an analysis of tunnelling data  @xcite or from inelastic neutron scattering data for superconductors  @xcite .",
    "along these lines , we have evaluated the electron spectral densities for lsco , bscco , and ybco in the flat model of ref .",
    "@xcite and also by solving the isotropic eliashberg equations on the matsubara frequencies . strictly speaking ,",

    "as regards the ratio gap , this quantity has been calculated by using the common formula , @xmath83 $ ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] several conclusions can be drawn about the relevance of the phonon - mechanism  @xcite .",
    "apparently , from the theoretical point of view the high values of the critical temperatures strongly depend on the approximation used to calculate them , and even in some cases on the inversion method used for obtain the spectral density . in this sense ,",
    "the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath0 has been usually considered a fit parameter used for obtaining the correct experimental critical temperatures , and then used to conclude strong or weak influence of the electron - phonon interaction on the superconductivity properties .",
    "nevertheless , the strong dependence of the derived parameters on the particular formulae considered , does not favour this procedure . then",
    ", our position here is determine the electron - phonon coupling parameter from experimental available spectroscopies as the energy dispersion curves obtained in arpes experiments and compare it with the @xmath84 value calculated with different approximations an different spectral functions .",
    "outstandingly , the clearest point is to check if , regardless the approach used for obtaining the spectral function , it leads or not to correct predictions for the observed values of @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "we should comment that other choices of the spectral density in which the interaction mechanism has a magnetic origin are also possible .",
    "nevertheless , in this picture , one must accept that the magnetic mode can be described by the same feynman diagram as the phonon mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1]d ) .",
    "this hypothesis was first proposed by berk and schrieffer  @xcite and recently invoked by dahm _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . to support our `` phononic choice '' we want to recall that the absence of the magnetic - resonance mode in lsco @xcite , bscco over - doped ( x=0.23 ) @xcite and its appearance only below @xmath6 in some cuprates ( e.g. , bi2201 @xcite ) are not consistent with the idea that the kink dispersion has a magnetic origin . on the other hand , recent studies on electron doped systems",
    "@xcite have shown that the intensity of the magnetic resonance mode is seemingly weak in comparison with the phonon mode to be considered as the cause of the strong electron energy dispersion measured by arpes . however",
    ", this issue will be reconsidered in our final discussion .",
    "it is well known that angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has become a powerful technique for evaluating the quasiparticle self - energies @xmath85 in condensed matter , despite the complexities in understanding the photoemission processes involved ( refer to our discussion in ref.@xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , within the electron - phonon coupling scenario and starting from eq.([eq_2 ] ) within the me approach , the electronic self - energy can be obtained from the complex expression @xmath86+\\upsilon(\\nu,\\omega , t)\\right\\}\\ , , \\label{eq_11}\\ ] ] with the function @xmath87 defined by @xmath88 here @xmath89 are the so - called digamma functions .",
    "now , recall that the bare band energy @xmath90 relates to the dressed band energy @xmath91 by @xmath92 . whereas the direct extraction of the self - energy from experiments appears to be troublesome",
    "because the underlying band structure of the bare electrons is _ a priori _ unknown , a theoretical determination of the bare band structure and its relation to the full energy renormalisation effects observed in the experiments seems much more attractive . in this sense ,",

    "the purpose of this section is to go through the prominent results obtained from arpes measurements on the ( 0,0)-(@xmath93 ) direction in the brillouin zone ( nodal direction ) avoiding the complications of the superconducting gap .",
    "we want to emphasize that in the nodal direction the _ d_-wave superconducting gap in cuprates is zero and the interactions involving a low - energy excitation appear as a well - defined slope change in the electronic energy - momentum dispersion in a similar energy scale ( @xmath94 or _ kink _  @xcite ( see fig .",

    "in fact , any theoretical assumption to include the _ d_-wave character of the gap function could be clouding the real influence of the phonon - coupling modes or even any other mechanism , strong or weak , it involved in the superconducting pairing properties . in this sense , is not queer that in the antinodal direction the kink - topology is not universal in comparison with the called universal nodal fermi velocity  @xcite .",
    "special attention will be payed on the electron - phonon interaction in htsc - cuprate compounds along the lines of the previous discussion .",
    "let us to mention that the energy distribution- and momentum distribution - curves ( edc - mdc ) are the two most popular ways for analysing photoemission data .",
    "the dichotomy between the mdc- and edc - derived bands from the same data raises critical questions about its origin and also about which one represents the intrinsic band structure . in this sense , we want to recall that at the larger bandwidth along the nodal direction , the mdc method can be reliably used to extract high quality data of dispersion in searching for fine structure . it has also been shown theoretically that this approach is reasonable in spite of the momentum - dependent coupling if we are only interested in identifying the mode energies @xcite . in a typical fermi liquid picture ,",
    "the mdc- and edc - derived dispersions are identical .",
    "moreover , in an electron - boson coupling system the lower and higher energy regions of the mdc- and edc - derived dispersions are still consistent , except right over the kink region @xcite .",
    "below , the good agreement between our theoretical data and the experimental facts supports this general picture .    considering that the kink effect is a common feature of the htsc cuprates , i.e.",
    ", it is observable regardless of the doping level or the temperature at which the measurement is performed , the only possible scenario seems to be the coupling of quasiparticle with phonons .",
    "the key issue seems to be the existence of an energy scale ( in the range of 40 - 80 mev ) . as in previous work ,",
    "our position in this paper has been to determine the evolution of the bare electron band energy @xmath96 through the systematic evaluation of the dressed band energy @xmath59 as a function of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath0 in several htsc cuprates , i.e. , lsco , bscco and ybco ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) . to be specific",

    "thus , based on an interpolation scheme between the numerical behaviour of the dressed energy band and the experimental data , one can introduce a universal dispersion relation @xcite which allows to reproduce in a quite general scheme the nodal dispersions close to the fermi level in lsco ( fig .",

    "in particular , taking the value @xmath163 instead of assuming the conventional @xmath82 , the coulomb effects are even more negligible in the renormalised energy .",

    "however , even when favoured , the phonon mechanism does not seem to be the only mechanism to be considered in the pair formation that leads at the higher critical temperatures observed in bscco opd90 and ovd58 samples .",

    "* 2*. we have assumed a very weak coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath163 ) , and * 3*. the empirical formula of kresin to determine @xmath6 has been used ( see figures  [ fig_1 ]  &  [ fig_8 ] ) . within this scenario , we get @xmath169 and @xmath170 , with the renormalisation parameters for the arpes `` bare '' dispersion @xmath171 and @xmath172 respectively for bscco opd90 . regarding the case of bscco ovd58 , the electron - phonon coupling parameters obtained are @xmath173 and @xmath174 , with the same @xmath103 values .",
    "then , we observe a widening of the kink effect suggesting the existence of at least one additional perturbation mechanism reducing the momentum of the dispersed quasiparticles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] ) .",
    "there are several possibilities as candidates of additional perturbation mechanisms , a suitable one being to investigate hidden factors in the intensity of the magnetic resonance mode and its evolution with the doping level  @xcite .",
    "now , we will consider the same hypotheses dealed above for the bscco family , i.e. : improving the phonon mechanism by assuming a very weak contribution of the coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath163 ) , in an effort to obtain appropriate values of @xmath6 in the case ybco ud35 , with the same value of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath175 .",
    "going into detail , we have used the methods by islam & islam  @xcite and shiina & nakamura  @xcite to determine the electron - phonon spectral densities ( fig .",

    "however , regarding the @xmath6 values of the under - doped family , they are still underestimated by a percentage of @xmath182 in ybco ud61 and around @xmath183 in ybco ovd90 .",
    "the renormalised energy @xmath59 as a function of the momentum @xmath135 under the assumption that the nodal dispersion is a consequence of the electron - phonon coupling and the coulomb effects are completely contained in the bare energies",
    ". then , we assume the very weak coulomb pseudopotential @xmath184 within the more favourable approximation for the calculus of @xmath6 within the phonon hypothesis , i.e. the kresin formula ( fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] ) and the epi spectral density @xmath185 obtained by the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite in bscco cases ( top ) , and refs .",
    "@xcite in ybco cases ( bottom ) . ]    on the other side , in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] we show the maximal influence of the electron - phonon coupling parameters that reproduce @xmath6 on the quasiparticle dispersion energies measured by arpes .",
    "analogously to the bscco cases , here we have assumed the most favourable scenario for the phonon hypothesis .",
    "we obtain @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , with the arpes `` bare '' dispersion renormalised at @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] ) . for the over - doped ybco ovd90 ,",
    "the electron - phonon coupling parameters obtained are @xmath190 and @xmath191 , with the arpes `` bare '' dispersion renormalised at @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] ) .",
    "then , the more remarkable widening of the kink effect is again suggesting the existence of at less one additional perturbation mechanism .",
    "in fact , in ybco the importance of an additional mechanism seems to be more significant that in bscco , and it could be related to the appearance of a second kink in the under - doped phase .",
    "very recent efforts have been focused on the high - energy part of the arpes data ( 0.2 - 1.5 ev ) revealing additional changes in the electron energy dispersion `` _ _ waterfalls _ _ '' at @xmath194 ev @xcite .",
    "the presence of a kink at these high energies immediately raises the question : what type of excitation spectrum is required to produce such renormalisation effect ?",
    "one possibility is that correlation effects at high orders strongly renormalises the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "moreover , with regard at the photoemission process and the inversion of the data measured in ybco samples one should take special care with the residual 3-dimensionality and the possible effect of the cuo chains .",
    "nevertheless , these high energy features remain under intense debate @xcite because it is still unclear whether they represent intrinsic band structure or not @xcite .",
    "in summary , it has been shown that , regarding the arpes measurements in superconducting cuprates the strong renormalisation of the band structure , customarily related to the dressing of the electron with excitations can be explained in terms of the conventional electron - phonon interaction . in fact , our results suggest that the electron - phonon interaction strongly influences the electron dynamics of the high-@xmath6 superconductors , and it is an important mechanism linked with the fermi surface topology .",
    "thus , the electron - phonon interaction ( strong or weak ) must be included in any realistic microscopic theory of superconductivity .",
    "remarkably , the proposal of a simple linear dispersion relation for the electron bare band energy , i.e. , @xmath195 , with the electronic mass - enhancement parameter @xmath5 defined self - consistently by the relation @xmath196 allows to reproduce the appearance of the ubiquitous nodal kink for a wide set of arpes experiments in the cuprates . here , @xmath0 has been interpreted as the strength of the electron - phonon interaction or electron - phonon coupling parameter , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath103 recognised as a universal property for each family of cuprates .",
    "in addition , at the lowest order of the feynman graphs for the electron - phonon interaction this method reassembles the `` @xmath0 '' values obtained from several discrepant models .    in this work",
    ", we have investigated the influence of the electron - phonon coupling mechanism through different doping levels in several families of htsc - cuprates . on the one hand",
    ", we have evaluated different methods for obtaining the electron - phonon spectral densities and their influence on the electron bare band energy , and on the other hand , several approaches have been recalled to obtain the critical temperatures .",
    "then , our results suggest that at least in the lsco family , and in the so - called bscco ud70 and ybco ud35 superconductors , the electron - phonon interaction could be the most relevant mechanism involved in the pair formation that leads to the superconductivity .",
    "our conclusion is supported by the experimental evidence of a mass renormalisation of the electronic dispersion curves measured along the nodal direction in arpes and the reported @xmath6 values in good agreement with our theoretical predictions .",
    "an excellent comparison between the theory and the available collection of experiments is achieved .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the consequences of assuming an enhanced phonon mechanism , through the reduction of the coulomb s pseudopotential weight .",
    "when appropriate @xmath84 values are obtained by this method , a remarkable widening of the predicted kink effect arises .",
    "this fact , suggest that independently of the approximations invoked and even avoiding the influence of the _ d_-wave superconducting gap through the nodal arpes measurements , it does nt seem possible to elude the existence of additional mechanisms that reduce the momentum of the dispersed quasiparticles in comparison with the phonon mechanism . in this sense , despite the fact that in lsco the influence of the magnetic mode seems not relevant , it is not possible to ignore its importance over the electron properties of other htsc families having in mind the recent observation by g. yu _ et al . _",

    "<S> despite the intensive efforts for determining the mechanism that causes high - temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials , no consensus on the pairing mechanism has been reached . </S>",
    "<S> recent advances in high resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopies have suggested that a sizeable electron - phonon coupling exists as the principal cause for kinks in the dispersion relations ( energy versus wave vector ) of the electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> here , we report on a systematic study about the influence of the electron - phonon coupling parameter `` @xmath0 '' in the electronic quasiparticle dispersions along the nodal direction for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> information about the dressing of the charge carriers , i.e. , on the enhancement of the effective mass and the strength of the coupling mode , is obtained as a function of the doping concentration , temperature , momentum and energy from the kink dispersion in the ( 0 - 0)-@xmath4 direction of momentum - space avoiding the complications of the _ _ d-__wave superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows a remarkable agreement between theory and experiment for different samples and at different doping levels . </S>",
    "<S> this includes our recently introduced theoretical model to adjust the experimental data of the fermionic band dispersion , emphasising the necessary distinction between the general electron mass - enhancement parameter @xmath5 and the conventional electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath0 . in lsco , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath0 , calculated consistently with the nodal kink dispersions , reproduces the observed critical temperatures @xmath6 , the gap ratio @xmath7 , and other parameters which have been studied from several equations . </S>",
    "<S> it will be concluded that the strong renormalisation of the band structure can be explained in terms of the phonon coupling mode , and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity , even for those materials in which the contribution to the pair formation can be less dominant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it seems unavoidable to consider additional mechanisms that justify the higher critical temperatures observed in bscco and ybco samples . </S>"
