    "evolutionary equations , as they were first introduced by picard ( @xcite ) , consist of a first order differential equation on @xmath0 as the time - line @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the derivative with respect to time and @xmath3 is a suitable closed linear operator on a hilbert space ( frequently a block - operator - matrix with spatial differential operators as entries ) .",
    "the function @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the unknowns , while @xmath6 is a given source term .",
    "this simple equation is completed by a so - called linear material law linking @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an operator acting in time and space .",
    "thus , the differential equation becomes @xmath9 a so - called evolutionary problem .",
    "the operator sum on the left - hand side will be established in a suitable hilbert space and thus , the well - posedness of relies on the bounded invertibility of that operator sum .",
    "for doing so , one establishes the time - derivative @xmath2 as a normal boundedly invertible operator in a suitable exponentially weighted @xmath10space . with the spectral representation of this normal operator at hand ,",
    "one specifies the operator @xmath8 as to be an analytic operator - valued function of @xmath11 then @xmath12 enjoys the property that it is causal due to the theorem of paley and wiener ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * theorem 19.2 ) ) .",
    "although the requirement of analyticity seems to be very strong , these operators cover a broad class of possible space - time operators like convolutions with suitable kernels naturally arising in the study of integro - differential equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , translations with respect to time as they occur in delay equations ( see @xcite ) as well as fractional derivatives ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the setting of evolutionary equations provides a unified framework for a broad class of partial differential equations .",
    "we note that the causality of @xmath8 also yields the causality of the solution operator @xmath13 of our evolutionary problem , which can be seen as a characterizing property of evolutionary processes . + after establishing the well - posedness of ,",
    "one is interested in qualitative properties of the solution @xmath4 .",
    "a first property , which can be discussed , is the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath4 , especially the question of exponential stability .",
    "the study of stability for differential equations goes back to lyapunov and a lot of approaches has been developed to tackle this question over the last decades .",
    "we just like to mention some classical results for evolution equations , using the framework of strongly continuous semigroups , like datko s lemma @xcite or the theorem of gearhart - prss @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter v ) for the asymptotics of semigroups ) . unfortunately ,",
    "these results are not applicable to evolutionary equations .",
    "the main reason for that is that the solution @xmath4 of is not continuous , unless the right - hand side @xmath6 is regular , so that point - wise estimates for the solution @xmath4 ( and this is how exponential stability is usually defined ) do not make any sense .",
    "hence , we need to introduce a more general notion of exponential stability for that class of problems .",
    "this was done by the author in @xcite ( see also subsection 2.2 in this article ) , where also sufficient conditions on the material law @xmath8 to obtain exponential stability were derived . + the main purpose of this article is to study the exponential stability of evolutionary problems of second order in time and space , i.e. to equations of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a densely defined closed linear operator , which is assumed to be boundedly invertible . for doing so",
    ", we need to rewrite the above problem as an evolutionary equation of first order in time . as it turns out",
    "there are several ways to do this yielding a family of new material law operators @xmath16 , such that can be written as @xmath17 for each @xmath18 .",
    "the goal is now to state sufficient conditions for the original operator @xmath19 such that there is @xmath18 for which the exponential stability of the equivalent problem can be derived .",
    "this is the main objective of subsection 3.1 .",
    "+ the article is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the framework of evolutionary equations . in this section",
    "we recall the definition of the time - derivative @xmath2 and of linear material laws .",
    "moreover , we introduce the notion of exponential stability for evolutionary equations and provide a characterization result using frequency domain methods ( ) . as already indicated above , subsection 3.1 deals with the exponential stability of or equivalently of and",
    "provides sufficient constraints on the material law @xmath8 , which yield the exponential stability . in subsection 3.2",
    "we focus on special material law operators @xmath8 , namely convolutions with a kernel @xmath20 .",
    "we derive sufficient conditions on the kernel @xmath20 , such that the corresponding integro - differential equations becomes exponentially stable .",
    "exponential stability of hyperbolic integro - differential equations was studied for instance in @xcite and @xcite ( where in @xcite also polynomial stability was addressed ) .",
    "we show that our conditions on the kernel @xmath20 , which  in contrast to the aforementioned references  is operator - valued , are weaker than the ones imposed in @xcite . finally , in section 4 , we treat a concrete example of a wave equation with convolution integral and time delay .",
    "this problem was recently studied in @xcite by using semigroup techniques and constructing a suitable energy for which the exponential decay was shown .",
    "we will see that this problem is covered by our abstract considerations and hence , the exponential stability follows .",
    "moreover , our approach allows to relax the assumptions on the kernel of the convolution integral .    throughout , all hilbert spaces are assumed to be complex .",
    "their inner products are denoted by @xmath21 which are linear in the second and conjugate linear in the first argument and the induced norms are denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "in this section we recall the notion of evolutionary problems , as they were first introduced in @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * chapter 6 ) ( see also @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "we begin by introducing the time - derivative in an exponentially weighted @xmath23-space in the first subsection .",
    "the second subsection is devoted to the well - posedness and exponential stability of evolutionary problems .",
    "the main theorem in this subsection ( ) characterizes the exponential stability of an evolutionary problem by point - wise properties of the unitarily equivalent multiplication operators ( such methods are frequently referred to as frequency domain methods ) .",
    "we remark that we generalize the notion of evolutionary problems in the sense that we do not impose monotonicity constraints on the operators involved . throughout ,",
    "let @xmath24 be a hilbert space .",
    "we introduce the time - derivative as a boundedly invertible operator on an exponentially weighted @xmath23-space .",
    "this idea first appears in @xcite . for the proofs of the forthcoming results , we refer to @xcite . for @xmath25",
    "we consider the following hilbert space @xmath26 equipped with the inner product @xmath27 we note that for @xmath28 this is nothing but the usual @xmath29 moreover we define the operators @xmath30 which are obviously unitary .",
    "we denote the derivative on @xmath31 with maximal domain by @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the classical sobolev - space of @xmath23-functions whose distributional derivative also belongs to @xmath35 it is well - known that this operator is skew - selfadjoint with @xmath36 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
