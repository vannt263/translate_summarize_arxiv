    "theories of interacting high spin fields . ] have been a subject of considerable interest for many years .",
    "this is partly due to the many particles with spin @xmath2 seen in accelerator laboratories and also because there is currently no general field theory description which is relativistic , interacting and also free of inconsistencies below . ] . over the years one interacting theory after another",
    "have been shown to be inconsistent leading many to suggest that all higher spin fields must be composite .",
    "on the other hand , higher spin elementary particles , such as the gravitino , play an important role in supersymmetry , which itself represents a fundamental building block of many modern unification schemes .",
    "thus we would like to remain hopeful that a solution to the consistency problems can be found within point particle field theory .",
    "perhaps our interpretation regarding the physical degrees of freedom is misguided or perhaps , as is our present concern , we have neglected symmetries or other aspects of nature that should be included . the hope being that if all of the symmetries are properly included , the result will be a consistent theory . that this hope is reasonable",
    "is exemplified by the fact that consistent solutions have already been found in restricted scenarios with curved backgrounds , cosmological constant tuning and planck scale masses @xcite .",
    "the consistency problems seem to exist for most interacting higher spin field theories and are a main concern of many theorists working in the field and so we will devote the final section of this paper to a discussion of the problem and touch on some possible consequences of the symmetry . perhaps the ideas that we present will inspire some new angles of attack on the problem .    the main goal of this paper is a review of the @xmath0-dimensional theory of interacting rarita - schwinger fields and an exploration of the symmetries .",
    "our hope is that the general expressions and the new interactions that we present here will be of use in formulating effective theories of interacting hadrons as well as work involving the massive gravitinos of supergravity such as , for example , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . perhaps the ads / cft results can be extended to the case wherein the rarita - schwinger fields are not fixed at the start as non - interacting and onshell is incompatible with the presence of additional non - gravitational interactions , for example a non - zero background electromagnetic field . ] .",
    "we begin in sections [ spincontent ] and [ conditions ] by ( re-)deriving the most general lagrangian and propagator for a rarita - schwinger spin-@xmath1 field using the method of aurilia and umezawa @xcite extended to @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "since we are using the vector - spinor representation of spin-@xmath1 , we find the usual result that a lower spin content is retained in the field in order to maintain the desirable properties of the action such as hermiticity , linearity in derivatives and non - singular behavior .",
    "however , recently there have been other promising ideas where the lower spin content is given a physical interpretation @xcite or where vector spinor description of spin-@xmath1 is replaced by a pure spin-@xmath1 field @xcite .    considering the lower spin components as unphysical , as we do here , leads to a non - unique action depending on an arbitrary complex parameter measuring the lower spin content of the theory .",
    "various choices of the parameter are seen to reduce the general expression to the spin-@xmath1 actions found in the literature .",
    "we formulate the equations in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions in anticipation of diverse applications from effective theories of hadronic interactions involving the spin-@xmath1 baryons to applications in arbitrary dimensional supergravity theories .",
    "for example , both the composite @xmath3 resonance found in low and intermediate energy nucleon scattering experiments and the gravitino of n - extended supersymmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking are thought to be described by the massive , spin-@xmath1 , rarita - schwinger field that we study here .",
    "in section [ group ] we examine the properties of the so - called ` point ' or ` contact ' transformations . these form a non - unitary group of transformations of the fields which shifts the parameter , amounting to a sort of rotation among the spin-@xmath4 degrees of freedom .",
    "the path integral is seen to be invariant under point transformations which implies that physical correlation functions are invariant under a redefinition of the arbitrary parameter . that the parameter is arbitrary is well known and this has caused many authors to simply fix it to a convenient value .",
    "unfortunately , this has served to hide some of the freedom of the theory .",
    "we restore the explicit parameter dependence and , in sections [ interactions ] and [ implications ] , we derive and examine new conserved currents resulting from the the symmetry .",
    "finally , in section [ consistency ] we discuss the consistency problems and point out a few ideas of how the conserved charge found in section [ implications ] might be useful in that context .",
    "the analysis we have used should also be generalizable to higher spins as well whenever the theory contains auxiliary fields of lower spin and has a similar symmetry group involving them .",
    "in this section we give a decomposition of the rarita - schwinger field into separate spin blocks and derive some general formulas and identities that will be needed later .",
    "the result of this and the following section is the expression for the most general free lagrangian .",
    "the reader only interested in the result may want to turn immediately to equation ( [ action1 ] ) or ( [ action1 ] ) below .    a commonly used formulation of the spin-@xmath1 field is the vector - spinor representation also , for example the 3 spinor representation @xcite and also the @xmath5 representation of @xcite . ] given by rarita and schwinger in 1941 @xcite .",
    "the vector - spinor transforms under the lorentz group as @xmath6   = \\left(1 , \\frac{1}{2}\\right ) \\oplus \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } , 1 \\right )   \\oplus \\left ( 0 , \\frac{1}{2 } \\right ) \\oplus \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } , 0 \\right)\\ ] ] whereas the spin decomposition of the field _ in the rest frame _ @xcite is @xmath7 the vector - spinor field thus contains two spin-@xmath4 components in addition to the physical spin-@xmath1 component .",
    "the decomposition of the spin-@xmath1 field that we will use is given by choosing @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the complimentary part is @xmath10 which can then be written in terms of spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath4 projectors as @xmath11 defining @xmath12 we have an expansion of the identity @xmath13 explicit expressions for the projectors can easily be found by contraction with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , but we will anticipate further applications in dimensional regularization . ] and generalize to @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "we define @xmath0-dimensional spin projection operators by requiring that they reduce properly to the usual 4 dimensional projection operators @xcite and yet remain projections in @xmath0-dimensions satisfying the following orthogonality relations , @xmath16 the result is @xmath17 \\\\ \\left ( p^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\right)_{\\mu \\nu } & = \\frac{1}{p^2 \\left(d - 1\\right ) } \\left [ \\left(d-2 \\right ) p_\\mu p_\\nu + { \\not \\negthinspace}{p } \\left ( \\gamma_\\mu p_\\nu - p_\\mu \\gamma_\\nu \\right ) + \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_\\nu p^2 \\right ] = p^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{11 } +   p^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{22 } \\\\ \\left ( p^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{11 } \\right)_{\\mu \\nu } & = \\frac{1}{p^2 \\left(d - 1\\right ) } \\left [ - p_\\mu p_\\nu + { \\not \\negthinspace}{p } \\left ( \\gamma_\\mu p_\\nu - p_\\mu \\gamma_\\nu \\right ) + \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_\\nu p^2 \\right ] \\\\",

    "we will construct the most general operator @xmath21 subject to the following four conditions",

    "these are a dirac equation for each of the vector components as well as supplementary conditions to remove the lower spin degrees of freedom : @xmath23 2 .",
    "the lagrangian should be non - singular in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , we would like the pole of the propagator to occur at the mass of the particle .",
    "3 .   the lagrangian should be linear in derivatives as it describes a fermionic field .",
    "4 .   the operator @xmath25 should be hermitian : @xmath26    a consequence of equation ( [ raritaschwinger ] ) in condition 1 is the condition @xmath27 as can be seen by multiplying the first equation in ( [ raritaschwinger ] ) on the left by @xmath28 and using the second equation .",
    "the condition @xmath29 ( where we now explicitly write the spinor indices @xmath30 ) represents a constraint equation for each value of the spin index @xmath31 whereas the condition @xmath32 is an equation of motion for the spinor components @xmath33 .",

    "the transformation ( [ pointtrans ] ) that we have used in the previous section is sometimes referred to as a ` point ' or ` contact ' transformation in the literature .",
    "the rarita - schwinger equations ( [ raritaschwinger ] ) tell us that the _ onshell _ spin-@xmath1 field @xmath65 satisfies the following equation @xmath124 as can be seen by the form of the transformation ( [ pointtrans ] ) : @xmath125 , along with the onshell constraint @xmath126 .",
    "when @xmath92 these transformations form a group with @xmath127 where we have defined the ` circle ' operation @xmath128 and the inverse parameter @xmath129 .",
    "the lagrangian is tautologically invariant under the transformation @xmath130 if , in addition to transforming the fields , we also transform the parameter @xmath91 as @xmath131 our field transformation together with the transformation ( [ halftrans ] ) of the parameter @xmath91 are frequently called a point transformation and @xmath91 are real we can use ( [ defna ] ) to rewrite the transformation of the parameter @xmath91 in terms of @xmath31 as @xmath132 .",

    "it is worthwhile to notice that separate transformations from the left and from the right act separately on @xmath91 and @xmath134 .",
    "if we recall how we formed our lagrangian by applying a transformation from the right and how the requirement that the operator be hermitian fixed @xmath135 we can see that @xmath136 we find the left hand transformations by taking the hermitian conjugate , @xmath137 hence transforming @xmath138 from the right affects only @xmath91 , whereas the transformation from the left affects only @xmath134 .",
    "we can use these left and right transformations , along with the definition of the rarita - schwinger lagrangian : @xmath139 , to write our most general lagrangian as @xmath140 substituting this expression into the relation ( [ invexpr ] ) we have @xmath141 \\lambda_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\text{rs } } & = \\delta^{\\delta}_{\\ ; \\nu}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the expression in brackets in the last line must therefore equal the rarita - schwinger propagator .",
    "so the point transformation group properties have given us a convenient way of deriving the general propagator from the parameterless rs propagator which much simpler than the method used in section [ conditions ] , namely : @xmath142    the point transformation becomes singular at the parameter value @xmath143 as can be seen by the fact that @xmath144 for any @xmath69 , so that @xmath145 in the singular case @xmath146 the transformations of the fields would no longer change the lower spin content of the operator and this choice may appear quite attractive . the problem with the choice @xmath143 is that the operator in the lagrangian no longer has an inverse @xcite as can be seen by the form of @xmath96 and @xmath147 in the propagator ( [ propagator1 ] ) .",

    "this is due to the fact that the transformation is not unitary .",
    "this will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "there has been some controversy about to how to include consistent interactions involving spin-@xmath1 fields @xcite .",
    "we find the most logical way is to require the interaction terms to transform the same way under point transformations as the free action as well as remaining consistent with the massless gauge invariance of the free action .",
    "in other words , we require that a shift of the parameter must leave the form of the entire action unchanged .",
    "this ensures that the the path integral remains independent of the parameter and is the reason why many authors require the action to be invariant under a point transformation combined with a compensating parameter shift .",
    "this requirement means that we must have a factor of @xmath155 for each @xmath156 field in the interaction lagrangian ( and thus a factor of @xmath157 in the hermitian conjugate ) so that a transformation @xmath158 will shift @xmath159 everywhere rather than simply @xmath160 and also there should be no ` offshell parameter ' dependence .",
    "this is discussed by pascalutsa and timmermans in @xcite . ] .",
    "expression ( [ general2 ] ) shows that , for interactions which depend on the parameter in the same way as the lagrangian operator in ( [ general ] ) , the inverse transformations attached to the rs propagator in ( [ general2 ] ) will cancel those of the interaction and will therefore lead to a theory whose green functions are independent of the parameter .",
    "we can see schematically that the correlation functions are invariant under redefinitions of the parameter as follows . in a theory satisfying our requirements the propagator and vertex",
    "can be written , respectively , as ( suppressing all indices for simplicity ) @xmath161 where the @xmath91 dependence on the right - hand - side is entirely contained in the @xmath162 factors : @xmath163 and @xmath164 are independent of @xmath91 .",
    "this implies that products of these expressions found in feynman diagrams will always reduce to the form @xmath165 similarly in the case of interactions with scalar fields , spinor fields , etc .",
    "for example , consider a diagram which might appear in resonant pion photoproduction at one - loop order shown in figure  [ pionfig ] .",
    "the parameter dependence of the green function is contained in the vertices and the spin-@xmath1 resonance propagator .",
    "our conditions require that the vertices and propagators can be written as @xmath166 where again the @xmath91 dependence is entirely contained within the @xmath162 factors .",

    "it may be possible , with judicious choices of couplings , to eliminate the contribution of one or the other of the lower spins altogether by eliminating the cross term which contains both spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath4 components .",
    "because of this new freedom , it seems that this new current will have some influence on the inconsistency problems that have been found in all interactions involving spin-@xmath1 fields @xcite .",
    "perhaps the inconsistencies can be made to cancel between the the different conserved currents so that the new symmetry can be used to find solutions to that long - standing problem .",
    "we will turn now to a bit of a review of the consistency problem , formulated in @xmath0-dimensions with arbitrary complex parameter as well as some ideas about the possibility of solutions ( or lack thereof ) .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introductory section , the problem of finding consistent interactions for the spin-@xmath1 field is an old one .",
    "it was first pointed out in paper by fierz and pauli in 1939 @xcite where the two - component spinor formalism was used to derive lagrangians for massive spin-@xmath1 and spin-2 with a minimally coupled electromagnetic field .",
    "they pointed out that subsidiary conditions are necessary to reduce the number of independent field components to the physical number .",
    "the subject of spin-@xmath1 was revisited by rarita and schwinger in 1941 @xcite who developed the notation and action that are now most often used .",
    "they also noticed that the theory was not unique and that a collection of actions all give equivalent theories .",
    "this is the same non - uniqueness that we have exploited in the present paper .",
    "consistency problems with the theory were further discussed in 1961 by johnson and sudarshan ( js ) @xcite who showed that in the presence of an electromagnetic field the field anti - commutator becomes indefinite , i.e. a lorentz frame can always be found in which it is negative .",
    "a related discovery by velo and zwanziger ( vz ) in 1969 @xcite was that there are modes of the field which propagate faster than light .",
    "these problems derive from precisely the reasons given by fierz and pauli in 1939 , namely that the lower spin particles should be removed by subsidiary conditions or they will give rise to negative energy states and indefinite charges and the number of subsidiary conditions must remain invariant to the presence of interaction .    in higher spin field theories involving auxiliary components and constraints ,",
    "the time derivative operator of the lagrangian is a singular matrix . that this is necessary can be exemplified with our spin-@xmath1 operator in ( [ action1 ] ) . the dynamical term , which contains the time derivative operator in the equations of motion , is given by @xmath217 where @xmath218 has suppressed spin indices and can be viewed , in 4 dimensions , as a @xmath219 matrix .",
    "the equations of motion imply a set of constraints ( equations among the field components which do not contain time derivatives ) and so not all of the components of @xmath220 are dynamical and these non - dynamical components will not appear in ( [ singop ] ) .",
    "hence , there must exist vectors , corresponding to the non - dynamical components , which are annihilated by the above matrix .",
    "therefore the matrix is necessarily singular and will have a determinant of zero .    in the case of spin-@xmath1 ,",
    "the constraints implied by the equations of motion are : the primary constraint , found by applying @xmath221 to the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) , and the secondary constraint , found by taking the covariant derivative of the equations of motion . in four spacetime dimensions ,",
    "as we have mentioned , these constitute a total of eight constraints needed to reduce the 16 component vector - spinor field to @xmath222 onshell degrees of freedom . in order to obtain a non - singular operator in ( [ singop ] )",
    "we must impose the constraint equations and eliminate the non - dynamical components in terms of dynamical ones , thus giving the on - shell equations of motions in terms of a new non - singular matrix .",
    "in the free field case everything works perfectly and the non - dynamical components can be eliminated without trouble .",
    "however , a problem occurs with the constraints in the presence of interaction in that the secondary constraint becomes dependent on the external field .",
    "this fact can lead to inconsistencies as we will now show for the canonical example of electromagnetic minimal coupling .",
    "our general action in the case of electromagnetic minimal coupling is found by inserting a covariant derivative into ( [ action2 ] ) , giving the following equations of motion @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the covariant derivative .",
    "if we apply @xmath225 to ( [ eqmot ] ) we are left with an expression which contains no time derivatives ( since @xmath179 vanishes when two indices are zero ) and is the primary constraint . to derive the secondary constraint we apply @xmath226 to ( [ eqmot ] ) to get",
    "the ` useful relation ' @xmath227 now take the covariant derivative of ( [ eqmot ] ) , using ( [ rel ] ) as well as the identities @xmath228 to arrive at the secondary constraint @xmath229 in four  like matrix @xcite . ]",
    "spacetime dimensions we can use the relation , and @xmath230 . ] @xmath231 with the dual field strength @xmath232 to write ( [ const2 ] ) in the simpler form @xmath233 where @xmath234 it should now be clear that the free field constraint @xmath126 is no longer true unless the interaction vanishes .",
    "now that we have the constraints in the presence of electromagnetic minimal coupling we can describe the general case of the well known problem @xcite .",
    "the secondary constraint ( [ const2b ] ) can be written as @xmath235 and one can easily see from the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) that , in the case @xmath123 , the components @xmath236 are non - dynamical . in that case",
    "they must be fixed by the above condition so that they can be eliminated in terms of the dynamical field components . to do this",
    ", one must solve ( [ const2c ] ) for @xmath236 .",
    "this requires that the matrix @xmath237 be non - singular .",
    "this implies , since @xmath123 , that the matrix @xmath238 is non - singular , which in turn requires that @xmath239 is non - singular .",
    "taking the determinant shows that this latter matrix is singular when @xmath240 .",
    "this is the famous result of @xcite and @xcite and means that if this equation is used to eliminate @xmath236 in the classical equations of motion one would find that , at this value of the external field , not all of the components of @xmath236 are determined and these undetermined components lead to space - like characteristic surfaces and the possibility of field modes propagating acausally .",
    "these non - physical characteristic surfaces indicate that the number of constraints has changed and that non - dynamical field components are still present in the field equations .",
    "for example , the operator coefficient to the time derivative in the equations of motion will still be a singular matrix at this external field value .",
    "note that we have conducted the analysis for @xmath113 , but we have lost no generality since the point transformation invariance can be used to transform this to the case of arbitrary @xmath170 . to see this ,",
    "let us briefly outline the method @xcite that is normally used to analyze the consistency of the classical field equations .",
    "the basic idea is to look at the characteristic surfaces given by the classical on - shell differential equation .",
    "to do this one plugs the constraints into the equations of motion , thus ( hopefully ) eliminating all of the non - dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "then the characteristics are found by replacing the derivative in the equation with a four - vector @xmath241 .",
    "this vector will be a normal to a characteristic surface ( a surface along which the maximum velocity solutions to the differential equation are restricted to propagate ) if it is the solution to a certain equation ( [ characteristics ] ) . if we want only time - like solutions , so that causality is preserved , we would like the normals to the characteristic surfaces to remain always space - like .",
    "the normals to the characteristic surfaces @xmath242 are given by the determinant @xmath243 where we have replaced the derivatives in the field equations with @xmath242 and @xmath244 is the operator in the field equations _",
    "after all of the constraints have been imposed_. if there is a time - like normal we can use lorentz invariance to write it as @xmath245 .",
    "our characteristic equation is then @xmath246 notice that if this determinant vanishes for @xmath123 , then it also vanishes for arbitrary @xmath170 by the properties of the point transformations .",
    "the vanishing of the determinant means that there are characteristic surfaces which are space - like , indicating the possibility that field components propagate acausally .",
    "we say ` indicating _ the possibility _ ' of acausal propagation because if the determinant was zero , so that there are space - like characteristics , one would still have to prove that there were actual physical field modes that propagate along these acausal characteristics .",
    "this is usually done with the method of shock discontinuities @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss this method further since it has been established many times that there are field modes which propagate acausally in various cases . on the other hand , to prove that a theory is consistent one would only need to show that there are no space - like characteristic surfaces and it would follow that there is no acausal propagation , without need of the method of discontinuities .",
    "notice that if we did nt impose constraints , the matrix in the determinant equation ( [ det ] ) would be the same one that we discussed earlier ( [ singop ] ) which is necessarily singular .",
    "thus , if the constraints failed to eliminate a non - dynamical field component .",
    "this component would remain in the field equations but it would , by definition , not appear in the time derivative part since it is non - dynamical .",
    "hence the matrix coefficient of the time derivative @xmath247 would annihilate the 16-component vector representing this component .",
    "the matrix then annihilates a non - zero vector and so it must have determinant equal to zero .",
    "conversely , the physical components all have time derivatives which means the matrix coefficient of the time derivative does not annihilate them .",
    "it is interesting that the inconsistency comes from the breakdown of constraints and is caused by non - dynamical , ` unphysical ' components creeping back into the field equations at certain values of the external field and the presence of these components leads to physical information propagating acausally .",
    "therefore , if we could find a covariant method of preventing these extra components from coming back the problems would be solved .",
    "unfortunately , this seemingly simple task is a subtle one and has not been accomplished in general since the problem was discovered over 40 years ago although there have been many papers written on the subject @xcite .",
    "we do not claim to have solved the problem here either , but we will present an idea that may be of some use in the search for a solution or a proof that one ca nt exist .    we should mention that , in the context of supergravity , when the mass of the spin-@xmath1 field is tuned in certain ways to the background spacetime , there are theories which seem to be free of inconsistencies @xcite . on the other hand , if we would like to use the theory to effectively model low mass spin-@xmath1 fields ( such as the @xmath3 nucleon resonance ) at low energies one can not expect the background spacetime or the existence of supersymmetry partners to be of much help .",
    "we have exemplified the problem for the case @xmath123 ( i.e. the supergravity action ) but , as we have said , the same is true for arbitrary @xmath170 since the lagrangian operators are related by a non - singular point transformation and so if the determinant ( [ characteristics ] ) is zero for one value of the parameter , a point transformation will not alter this and it will be zero for any parameter value .",
    "in any case , we can now ask : is it possible that the new symmetry current and charge can help us ?",
    "the conserved charge arises from a symmetry of the path integral which is not shared by the usual classical theory , so if a solution to this problem could be found from this charge it would have the happy consequence that the inconsistency which is present in the classical theory would not affect the physical correlation functions .",
    "conversely , it is also possible that the extra symmetry of the path integral may make things even worse .",
    "suppose we begin with no interaction and then slowly turn on an external field .",
    "in that case we can argue that the charge should remain zero since it is zero in the free case and is conserved . the charge ( [ charge ] ) is given in an electromagnetic background by @xmath248.\\ ] ] the conservation of charge is related to the conservation of constraints since the spin-@xmath4 fields @xmath249 and @xmath236 in the charge are exactly the ones which are usually removed via the constraint structure of the free field rarita - schwinger equations .",
    "hence it seems possible that the loss of constraints , which signals the onset of the inconsistency , will have a direct effect on the charge .",
    "this gives us an idea for a possible new direction .",
    "when the external field is such that there is a loss of constraints the charge should remain unaffected since it is conserved .",
    "it is possible then , that in that case , the equation for the charge would represent an additional constraint which could be used to eliminate the unphysical fields which appear when the usual constraints breakdown .",
    "however , we do not want the extra constraint in general , but only in the case when the usual constraints breakdown and then only so as to exactly compensate for the breakdown .",
    "this seems like quite a demand .",
    "if the conservation of charge implied additional contraints in general we would then have too many constraints as soon as the background is turned on .",
    "so physically we want the charge to be identically zero when the constraints are imposed .",
    "the only time the situation changes is when the usual constraints break down . in that case",
    "we want the charge to no longer vanish identically , but to itself become a constraint compensating for the ones that were lost .",
    "the usual constraints are given by @xmath250 and this combination then also appears in the expression for the charge .",
    "so perhaps it is possible that a breakdown of this equation would have a compensating effect in the conserved charge . in any case",
    ", we will leave this problem for now with the hope that these thoughts may inspire new angles of attack so that either a new solution , or a new reason for the lack of one , can be found .",
    "we will now summarize the main features of our work .",
    "we have derived the general lagrangian and propagator for the rarita - schwinger field in @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "these are given by equations ( [ action1 ] ) and ( [ propagator1 ] ) respectively and should prove useful in calculating higher loop effects in dimensional regularization as would occur in the effective resonance contribution to the imaginary part of pion scattering amplitudes , anomalous magnetic moments , and many other processes for which the @xmath3 resonance or any other spin-@xmath1 particles play a significant role .",
    "we studied the point transformation algebra and explored the invariance properties of the general action under rotations of the lower spin , off - shell fields .",
    "we found that this invariance implies the existence of a conserved vector current and charge .",
    "the conserved current leads to interactions involving spin-@xmath1 fields such as the electromagnetic couplings that we have given in ( [ newem ] ) above , possible couplings to other vector fields such as vector mesons , derivative couplings to scalar fields such as the pion , etc .",
    "it is important to check the predictions of these interactions .    finally , we looked at the consistency problems and indicated two possible avenues where progress might be made .",
    "the first is a possible cancellation of the problematic terms by tuning interactions based on the conserved current .",
    "the second is by using the conserved charge as an additional constraint to compensate for the loss of the usual constraints at the ` bad ' values of the external magnetic field .",
    "it is important to attempt a generalization of these techniques in the theory of higher spin fields in the same way as done for spin-@xmath1 .",
    "it seems likely that similar ( though more complicated ) groups will exist which rotate among the auxiliary lower spin components in those cases as well , leading again to new conserved currents .",
