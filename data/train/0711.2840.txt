    "scalar fields play a fundamental role in the modern cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "having come in them from the theory of elementary particles , the scalar fields are widely used both at creation of models of compact objects and at research of the evolution of the universe as a whole . in particular , the models of quasi - star objects from scalar fields , the so - called boson stars , are well - known  @xcite . in turn in cosmology",
    "scalar fields are the basis for creation of models of the early inflationary universe  @xcite .",
    "another field of application of scalar fields is connected with one of the most exciting event in astrophysics and cosmology of the last decades - discovery of the acceleration of the present universe  @xcite .",
    "this discovery has stimulated an appearance of a large amount of various models trying to explain this phenomenon .",
    "a basis of all the models consists in violation of different energy conditions .",
    "for cosmology , most essential are two energy conditions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the first one , the so - called strong energy condition ( sec ) , states that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are effective energy density and pressure of matter which determine the evolution of the universe . in hydrodynamical language",
    "this means that the parameter of the equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "this case corresponds to the decelerated expansion of the universe ( the friedmann models ) .",
    "violation of the sec leads to the accelerated expansion of the universe ( the inflationary models ) .",
    "the second condition , the so - called weak energy condition ( wec ) , states that @xmath4 , whence it appears that @xmath5 .",
    "failure satisfying the wec results in exponential or more fast accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the substance providing such acceleration was called dark energy .",
    "this term usually means that the equation of state lies in the range @xmath6 ( the cosmological constant , quintessence  @xcite , chaplygin gas  @xcite , the theories of gravitation with high derivatives  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "all the models describe the present accelerated expansion of the universe within the accuracy of observations .",
    "the mentioned above violation of the sec is normally arisen at some choice of a potential energy of usual scalar fields ( see examples of such potentials in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite by a model - independent way on the basis of study of data sets containing 172 snia , it is possible in the present epoch that @xmath7 , i.e. the wec can be violated .",
    "( for more recent papers with the latest observational data see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) such an unusual state of matter is also known as phantom dark energy  @xcite .",
    "there are models of phantom energy within the framework of higher - order theories of gravity  @xcite , braneworld cosmology  @xcite , etc .",
    "another popular direction consists in consideration of ghost scalar fields with negative sign before kinetic term  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the cosmological model of the early universe with two interacting ghost scalar fields with special form of the potential energy : @xmath8 here @xmath9 are two scalar fields with the masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the self - coupling constants and @xmath13 - some constant which should be chosen on the assumption of a problem statement .",
    "the essential feature of this potential is presence of two local minima at @xmath14 .",
    "it allows existence of localized solutions with finite energy in problems with such potential . as is known  @xcite , for a case of one scalar field",
    ", localized solutions could exist only for a case with two or more minima of potential energy when solutions start in one minimum and tend to another one . in a case of two scalar fields , a situation is possible when a solution starts and finishes in the same minimum . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a case was carried out : the solution started at @xmath15 and returned to the same local minimum at @xmath16",
    ". such type of soliton - like solutions , localized on a spacelike hypersurface , known as spacelike branes ( s - branes )  @xcite .    the mentioned in ref .",

    "solutions for phantom fields allows us to hope for presence of similar solutions and for a _",
    "static _ case . in this paper",
    "we consider three models created by two interacting phantom and ghost scalar fields with the potential : 1 ) a traversable wormhole ; 2 ) a brane - like solution  analog of a domain wall solution but with asymptotically non - flat spacetime ( anti - de sitter spacetime ) ; 3 ) a spherically symmetric particle - like solution .    the model of so - called traversable wormhole",
    "was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this wormhole is created by some special matter with the violated wec .",
    "as phantom scalar fields also violate the wec , they could be used at modelling of traversable wormholes .",
    "the researches of such models were already carried out ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in these works",
    "some effective hydrodynamical energy - momentum tensor with the equation of state @xmath7 was chosen as a source of matter . but a distribution of this matter was added by hand and , correspondingly , the _ nonself - consistent _ models of the traversable wormholes were considered . in this paper",
    "we consider a _ self - consistent _ model of a traversable wormhole created by two interacting phantom and ghost scalar fields with the potential .",
    "the specified above features of this potential allow us to find regular solutions with localized energy density .",
    "domain walls are topological defects and they arise in different aspects both in particle physics and cosmology ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they separate a spacetime into several domains along a single coordinate . in a case of scalar",
    "fields domain wall solutions exist when the scalar filed potentials have isolated minima .",
    "the domain walls are surfaces separating minima of the potentials with different vacuum expectation values .",
    "the region of fast change of the scalar field corresponds to the domain wall .",
    "the domain wall refers to as _ thin _ wall if the energy density of the scalar field is localized at the domain wall surface and could be replaced by the delta function .",
    "the different variants of the domain wall solutions were found in refs .",
    "@xcite with asymptotically flat , de sitter and schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "there are also known the so - called _ thick _ domain wall solutions  @xcite which could exist at late - time phase transitions in the evolution of the universe . in this paper",
    "the consideration of the thick domain wall model with the potential is presented .",
    "search of spherically symmetric solutions with various matter sources always was an important problem in special and general relativity .",
    "such solutions are using both at investigation of different particle - like models of elementary particles and creation of models of star - like objects and another large - scale configurations .",
    "the source of matter is fields with various spins both interacting between each other and with gravitational field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "there are well - known regular solutions for the scalar fields both for noninteracting and self - interacting fields  @xcite . for a case of usual ( non - phantom ) scalar fields , the model of boson star with potential",
    "was considered in ref .",
    "it was shown there that there are regular solutions in the case under consideration .",
    "recently the spherically symmetric model with self - gravitating matter with the hydrodynamic equation of state @xmath7 was considered in ref .",
    "below we show that regular solutions for spherically symmetric case exist for phantom and ghost scalar fields also .",
