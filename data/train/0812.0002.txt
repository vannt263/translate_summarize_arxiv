    "to understand the origin of the accelerating expansion of the universe is one of the salient question in contemporary cosmology @xcite .",

    "alternatively , it might cast some doubts on the theoretical foundation of current cosmology , that is the theory of general relativity ( gr ) . from a theorist point of view , as most efforts to construct self - consistent de models within gr seem unsuccessful , there is no a priori reason to rule out a modification to gravity on cosmological scales as an explanation @xcite . from an observer point of view , whereas gr passes direct tests probing the solar system scales ( @xmath1 m ) down to the laboratory scales ( @xmath2 m ) @xcite , testing gravity on cosmological scales is challenging and overly model dependant so far . in this work ,",
    "we propose to remedy these issues by defining a set of simple model independent tests of gr on cosmological scales , although more complicated models of gr ( clumping dark energy or interacting dark energy models ) are not considered in this paper ( the complete set of test including both exotic dark energy models is being prepared as the second step of testing gravity ) .",

    "any of these relations proved to be violated , it would be a clear sign of a break - down of gr and it would highly motivate theoretical work on alternatives to gr .",
    "reversely , before any such conclusion can be reached , it requires an absolute demonstration that observational systematic effects are well under controlled .",
    "a firm believer in gr might look at these states as simple test of systematic effects .",
    "note that throughout this work , we will assume the validity of standard cosmology , that is to say the validity of the copernican principle @xcite .",
    "if this was not the case , then the de problem could be solve without new physics and more specific tests would have to be designed @xcite .",
    "several alternative approaches to test gr have been proposed so far , some parametric , some non - parametric .",
    "the parametric approaches can be classified into several categories according to their goal : i ) to separate the geometrical and growth signatures in the @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 plane  @xcite , ii ) to define the probed @xmath6 range in a model independant manner @xcite , iii ) to look for an anomalous linear growth rate using the @xmath7 parameter  @xcite , iv ) to parametrize the metric perturbations  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , non - parametric approaches were developed by  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we advocate the use of a non - parametric approach  based on a set of gr based consistency relations  to test gravity on cosmological scales .",

    "more precisely , by using a combination of the two first , we will be able to compare it to the later . in this work , extending the work of @xcite we focus closely on potential observational biases .",
    "we propose in particular various ways to deal with the galaxy bias , redshift space distortion and spectroscopic and photometric redshifts .",

    "in a metric theory of gravity , large scale structures correspond to metric and matter - energy momentum perturbations . in the newtonian gauge ,",
    "metric perturbations are described by ds^2=-(1 + 2)dt^2+(1 + 2)a^2_ijdx^idx^j , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote curvature perturbations and the newtonian force respectively . in this work ( except in section sec .",
    "[ sec : cc_with_vel ] ) we will aim at constructing gr consistency relations and thus we will work within gr .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a linear theory of perturbations on sub - horizon scales to get simpler and easier to test relations",
    ". we will also consider matter density fluctuations to be dominating the growth of perturbations and thus neglect de clustering .",
    "the first simple relation that can be tested within gr is based on the continuity equation : [ eq : en_con ] = - where @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "both sides of this equation can be probed observationally independently and we shall call the observational test of this relation the _ energy - momentum consistency test_. as will be seen below , whereas peculiar velocities can be traced directly , probing matter density fluctuations requires to deal with several observational artifacts . in this paper",
    ", we will assume this relation to be satisfied and we will use it for our observational determination of the galaxy bias .",
    "note however that it could be violated due to dark sector interactions .",
    "the second consistency relation stems from the lack of anisotropic stress and relates metric perturbations .",
    "since in this paper , we neglect de clustering , only the matter component clusters and the no anisotropic stress approximation is valid , [ eq : me_con ] + = 0 , which reduces the degrees of freedom of metric perturbations . while the newtonian force @xmath9 can be reconstructed from the evolution of peculiar velocities , the curvature perturbation @xmath8 is given by matter fluctuations .",
    "thus both observables could be compared to determine the presence of non - trivial anisotropic stress which is predicted in most modified gravity models and dark energy clumping model .",
    "we call this test the _ metric consistency test_.    the other tests relate metric perturbations to matter - energy fluctuations , dynamically or non - dynamically .",
    "newtonian force sources the dynamics of matter fluctuations .",
    "if the time evolution of peculiar velocity can be reconstructed , then so can @xmath9 through the euler equation , [ eq : dyn_con ] = -h_m + , which we label as the _ dynamical constraint test_. because the degrees of freedom available in metric perturbations are reduced by the no - anisotropy condition in gr , we shall not use this constraint in this paper .    finally , the relation between curvature perturbations and matter fluctuations yield the _ non - dynamical constraint test _ , also known as the poisson equation .",
    "it is a key relation which we will use and test in this work .",

    "velocity surveys , direct ( kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich or peculiar velocities measurements ) or indirect ( galaxy redshift survey ) allow us in principle to probe @xmath13 . finally , metric perturbations are directly probed by weak gravitational lensing which distorts the shape of source galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "since the geodesics are determined by the gradient of combination of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as @xmath14 , weak lensing will probe the integrated effect of metric combination which is @xmath15 .",
    "we will introduce our notations for those observables below before discussing in more details the specifics of the test we are interested in .",
    "= 0.38 = 0.49",

    "it is not identical to unity , but it is just off by a percentage level . still the difference due to systematic effect is much smaller than the theoretical deviation due to violated gr assumptions , e.g @xmath0 ( r : ricci scalar ) gravity model with @xmath107 ( long dash curve in fig .  [ fig : alpha_error ] ) , where @xmath108 is defined as , b_0=()^-1 .",
    "dash and dotted curves are statistical errors from different galaxy bias estimation from redshift survey alone and cross - correlations .",
    "the advantage of this test over reconstructed @xmath94 is that we are able to see tomographic view of consistency relation .",
    "in this paper , we advocate the use of consistency relations to test gravity on cosmological scales .",
    "we did so by using a combination of observables .",
    "this approach remains model independent and does not rely on any specific parametrization .",
    "we focused in particular on the joint use of galaxy surveys and weak - lensing observables .",
    "we showed how using the former to predict the latter , we can build a strong self - consistency test for gr .",
    "we also showed how large - scale redshift surveys can be extremely valuable in such an endeavor .",
    "the test we proposed seems particularly appealing since any weak - lensing survey is also by nature a galaxy clustering survey and we illustrated how even a photo - z survey can be used to build a strong self - consistency test .",
    "we thus expect this test to be applied in the near future to the cfhtls survey and others like des , the proposed jdem and euclid space missions .",
    "we address in this work the key observational and astrophysical systematics like the galaxy bias and redshift uncertainties but many more survey specific ones would have to be carefully studied before any conclusion can be drawn from any particular data - sets , e.g. @xmath23 errors , psf correction and variation over large scales .",
    "it is quite likely that this kind of test will be ultimately limited by the level of control of systematics . in particular , we purposefully worked on linear scales .",
    "non - linear effects in real and redshift space will limit the useful scales for such a program .",
    "if we assume that we can handle non - linear effects up to k=0.3 @xmath109/mpc , we can see in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : contour_bias ] that our program is still tractable .",
    "besides , weak - gravitational lensing has now been measured in the linear regime where this test could be applied @xcite .",
    "another unexplored sides of our work lie in the possible degeneracies with underlying cosmological model parameters but we leave this study for future work .    more positively , although , our survey parametrization is quite generic , these surveys could certainly be customized to enhance the discriminatory power of this test and others .",
    "we encourage future missions to include the feasibility of such tests as an extra criteria in the optimization of their design .    assuming that all systematics are well under control",
    ", we can wonder what new physics can be probed with this test . as an illustration , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_wl_wl_error ] the predictions for a @xmath0 theory where a non - linear function @xmath43 of the ricci scalar @xmath110 is added to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "we considered typical value of the dimensionless compton wavelength parameter @xmath107 ( see eq .",
    "17 in @xcite ) . in @xmath0 gravity models ,",
    "the poisson equation is modified so that @xmath111 and a non - zero anisotropy stress is introduced to break the simplest gr model anisotropy condition @xmath112 . as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_wl_wl_error ] , the predicted @xmath94 for a @xmath0 gravity model using gr assumptions would differ from the observed one at a level well exceeding the various potential biases .",
    "this discrepancy originates from the gr assumption in eq .",
    "[ recon_m ] since any non - zero anisotropic stress invalidates the relation @xmath113 . however , the reduced mass scale affecting @xmath0 theories modify the poisson equation . it can thus be probed directly using the cross - correlation technique detailled in sec .",
    "[ sec : cc_with_vel ] . note that since the difference between this @xmath0 model and gr increases when the redshift decreases , so does the discrepancy between the observed and predicted @xmath114 for a @xmath0 theory . from the fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_error ] it can be seen that constraints on @xmath108 of order @xmath115 or less are in principle feasible with such a test .",
    "other aspects of @xmath0 theories are discussed in @xcite .    more generally , it can be argued that any theory with non - minimal interaction in the dark sector or dark energy clumping would fail this test since it either modifies the poisson equation or introduce an anisotropic stress @xcite .",
    "reversely , it is important to note that some types of modified gravity models would pass the test we detailed here .",
    "for example , the potentials following from a dgp model @xcite are modified in such a way that the light path tracing potential differences is similar to the standard @xmath97cdm predictions . to detect such models",
    ", we need to implement the program proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the tests presented above are only two of examples of the possible one highlighted in sec .",
    "[ sec : conv ] and we plan to extend our studies to include other consistency relations as well as other observables like the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite and the lensing of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "we believe however that the observational program sketched in this paper already offers a stringent observational test of gr and we thus plan to put it into action using current data ."
