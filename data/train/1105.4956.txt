    "kerr space - time is the only possible vacuum exterior solution of einstein s field equations describing a stationary , rotating , uncharged black hole with non - degenerate event horizon @xcite and is expected to be the unique , stationary , asymptotically flat , vacuum space - time containing a non - degenerate killing horizon @xcite .",
    "also , it is expected to be the asymptotic limit of the evolution of asymptotically flat vacuum data in general relativity .",
    "an important step towards establishing the validity of these expectations is the proof of the stability of kerr space - time . in comparison to schwarzschild space - time , where linearized stability has been proved ,",
    "this problem is complicated by a lower dimensional symmetry group and the absence of a killing field that is everywhere time - like outside the horizon .",
    "for instance , the latter is reflected in the fact that energy densities corresponding to the klein - gordon field in a kerr gravitational field have no definite sign .",
    "this absence complicates the application of methods from operator theory and of so called `` energy methods '' that are both employed in estimating the decay of solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations . of @xcite . ] on the other hand , two facts are worth noting . for this , note that in the following any reference to coordinates implicitly assumes use of boyer - lindquist coordinates @xcite .",
    "first , in addition to its killing vector fields that generate one - parameter groups of symmetries ( isometries ) , kerr space - time admits a killing tensor @xcite that is unrelated to its symmetries .",
    "initiated by his groundbreaking work @xcite on the complete separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation in a kerr background , carter discovered that an operator that is induced by this killing tensor commutes with the wave operator . on the other hand",
    ", carter s operator contains a second order time derivative @xcite .",
    "an analogous operator has been found for the operator governing linearized gravitational perturbations of the kerr geometry @xcite .",
    "a recent study finds another such ` symmetry operator ' which only contains a first order time derivative and commutes with a rescaled wave operator @xcite . differently to carter s operator , this operator is analogous to symmetry operators induced by one - parameter group of isometries of the metric , in that it induces a mapping in the data space that is compatible with time evolution , and therefore describes a true symmetry of the solutions .",
    "it is likely that an analogous operator can be found for a rescaling of the linearized operator governing gravitational perturbations of the kerr geometry . in case of existence",
    ", it should facilitate the generalization to a kerr background of the regge - wheeler - zerilli - moncrief ( rwzm ) decomposition of fields on a schwarzschild background @xcite which in turn should greatly simplify the analysis of the stability of kerr space - time .",
    "second , there is a killing field that is time - like in an open neighborhood of the event horizon given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 are coordinate vector fields of boyer - lindquist coordinates corresponding to the coordinate time @xmath3 and the azimuthal angular coordinate @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath6 $ ] its rotational parameter .",
    "moreover , if @xmath7 @xmath8 is time - like in the ergoregion , see lemma  [ timelikeregion ] . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath9 itself is space - like in the ergoregion , null on the stationary limit surface and time - like outside . for these reasons , at least for @xmath10 satisfying ( [ inequality ] )",
    ", it might be possible to  join \" energy inequalities belonging to the killing fields by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the discussion of the stability of the kerr black hole is in its early stages .",
    "the first intermediate goal is the proof or disproof of its stability under `` small '' perturbations . as mentioned before ,",
    "the linearized stability of the schwarzschild metric has already been proved . in that case , by using the rwzm decomposition of fields in a schwarzschild background , the question of the stability can be completely reduced to the question of the stability of the solutions of the wave equation on schwarzschild space - time . for kerr space - time , a similar reduction is not known .",
    "if such reduction exists , there is no guarantee that the relevant equation is the scalar wave equation .",
    "it is quite possible that such equation contains an additional ( even positive ) potential term that , similar to the potential term introduced by a mass of the field , could result in instability of the solutions .",
    "second , an instability of a massive scalar field in a kerr background could indicate instability of the metric against perturbations by matter which generically has mass .",
    "if this were the case , even a proof of the stability of kerr space - time could turn out as a purely mathematical exercise with little relevance for general relativity .",
    "currently , the main focus is the study of the stability of the solutions of the klein - gordon field on a kerr background with the hope that the results lead to insight into the problem of linearized stability . although the results of this paper also apply to the case that @xmath11 , its main focus is the case of klein - gordon fields of mass @xmath12 . quite differently from the case of a schwarzschild background",
    ", the results for these test cases suggest an asymmetry between the cases @xmath11 and @xmath13 . in the case of the wave equation ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath11 , results point to the stability of the solutions @xcite , whereas for @xmath13 , there are a number of results pointing in the direction of instability of the solutions under certain conditions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "unstable modes were found by the numerical investigations by furuhashi and nambu for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , by strafuss and khanna for @xmath14 and @xmath16 and by cardoso and yoshida for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the analytical study by hod and hod finds unstable modes for @xmath14 with a growth rate which is four orders of magnitude larger than previous estimates . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite proves that the restrictions of the solutions of the separated , in the azimuthal coordinate , klein - gordon field ( rkg ) are stable for @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the ` azimuthal separation parameter ' and @xmath21 .",
    "so far , this has been the only mathematically rigorous result on the stability of the solutions of the rkg for @xmath12 .",
    "this result contradicts the result of zouros and eardley , but is consistent with the other results above .",
    "in addition , there is the numerical result by konoplya and zhidenko , @xcite which confirms the result of beyer , _ but also finds no unstable modes of the rkg for @xmath22 and @xmath14_. among others , this paper improves the estimate ( [ massineq ] ) .",
    "it is proved that the solutions of the rkg are stable for @xmath0 satisfying @xmath23 further , it gives new formulations for rkg , in particular , in form of a time - dependent wave equation that is governed by a family of unitarily equivalent positive self - adjoint operators .",
    "the latter might turn out useful in future investigations . on the other hand",
    ", it is proved that from the abstract properties of this family alone it can not be concluded that the corresponding solutions are stable .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  @xmath24 gives the geometrical setting of the discussion of the solutions of the rkg and a proof of the above mentioned property of the killing field @xmath8 .",
    "section  @xmath25 gives basic properties of operators read off from the equation , including some new results .",
    "these properties provide the basis for a formulation of the initial - value problem for the equation in section  @xmath26 which is less dependent on methods from semigroups of operators than that of @xcite .",
    "section  @xmath26 also contains the improved result on the stability of the solutions of rkg , a formulation of the rkg in terms of a time - dependent wave equation and the above mentioned counterexample .",
    "finally , the paper concludes with a discussion of the results and @xmath24 appendices that contain proof of results that were omitted in the main text to improve the readability of the paper .",
    "in boyer - lindquist coordinates denote coordinate projections whose domains will be obvious from the context . in addtion , we assume the composition of maps , which includes addition , multiplication and so forth , always to be maximally defined .",
    "for instance , the sum of two complex - valued maps is defined on the intersection of their domains .",

    "hence in such case it might be expected that ( [ timedep2ndorderequation ] ) for @xmath168 implies that @xmath243 is not exponentially growing since this is the case if @xmath244 for every @xmath166 , where @xmath134 is a densely - defined , linear , positive self - adjoint operator in @xmath55 . in that case , @xmath72 is given by @xmath245 for all @xmath246 , where @xmath247 and @xmath248 denote the bounded linear operators that are associated by the functional calculus for @xmath249 to the restriction of @xmath250 and the restriction of the continuous extension of @xmath251 to @xmath252 , respectively , to the spectrum of @xmath249 @xcite .",

    "the mathematical investigation of the stability of kerr space - time has started , but is still in the phase of the study of relevant model equations in a kerr background .",

    "on the other hand , inspection of the reduced klein - gordon equation , [ kleingordonequation ] , reveals that the case of @xmath12 originates from the case @xmath11 by the addition of a positive bounded potential term @xmath260 to the equation .",
    "if there were no first order time derivative present in the equation , from this alone it would be easy to prove that the stability of the solutions of the wave equation implies the stability of the solutions of the klein - gordon equation for non - vanishing mass . even in the presence of such a derivative , it is hard to believe that the addition of such term causes instability . in particular , the energy estimates in lemma  [ conservationlaws ] , indicate a stabilizing influence of such a term . on the other hand , so far , there is no result that would allow to draw such conclusion .",
    "the numerical results that indicate instability in the case @xmath13 make quite special assumptions on the values of the rotational parameter of the black hole that do not make them look very trustworthy .",
    "they could very well be numerical artefacts .",

    "it seems that the proof of the stability of the solutions of the wave equation in a kerr background will soon be established .",
    "the question of the stability of the massive scalar field in a kerr background is still an open problem , with only few rigorous results available , and displays surprising mathematical subtlety . in particular , in this case standard tools of theoretical physical investigation , including numerical investigations , seem too imprecise for analysis .",
