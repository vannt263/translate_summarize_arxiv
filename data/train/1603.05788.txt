    "one of the oldest problems of algebra is the equation solvability problem over a given algebraic structure . nowadays ,",
    "many such classical problems arise in a new perspective , namely to consider their computational complexity . in this paper",
    "we investigate the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite groups and rings .",
    "the _ equation solvability problem _ over a finite group @xmath0 asks whether or not two group expressions ( i.e.  products of variables and elements of @xmath0 ) can attain the same value for some substitution over @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , for the equation solvability problem , one needs to find if there exists at least one substitution satisfying the equation .",
    "another interesting problem is whether or not _ all _ substitutions satisfy the equation .",
    "the _ equivalence problem _ over a finite group @xmath0 asks whether or not two group expressions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equivalent over @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath3 ) , that is whether or not @xmath1 and @xmath2 determine the same function over @xmath0 .",
    "first burris and lawrence @xcite investigated the complexity of the equivalence problem over finite groups .",
    "they proved that if a group @xmath0 is nilpotent or @xmath4 , the dihedral group for odd @xmath5 , then the equivalence problem for @xmath0 has polynomial time complexity .",
    "they conjectured that the equivalence problem for @xmath0 is in polynomial time if @xmath0 is solvable , and conp - complete otherwise .",
    "horvth and szab @xcite confirmed the conjecture for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are abelian groups such that the exponent of @xmath7 is squarefree and @xmath9 .",
    "later horvth @xcite generalized this result to semidirect products @xmath10 , where @xmath7 and @xmath11 are abelian groups ( here @xmath12 denotes the centralizer of @xmath7 in @xmath13 ) .",
    "horvth , lawrence , mrai and szab @xcite proved the conp - complete part of the conjecture .",

    "such a change in the length suggests that the complexity of the equivalence problem might be different if the input polynomials are restricted to be written as sums of monomials .",

    "hence we can use ideas of the proof described in section  [ 2 . ] .",
    "we give a new , efficient algorithm that decides the equation solvability problem over nilpotent matrix rings in section  [ 3 . ] .",
    "in this section we consider the equation solvability problem over semmipattern groups .",
    "first we characterize the multiplication of matrices from @xmath41 in lemma  [ mxszor ] .",
    "we use this formula in our algorithm .",

    "the lemma can be proved by induction on @xmath125 .",
    "however , instead of giving the technical induction proof , we explain how one can arrive at this formula .",
    "let us consider the @xmath46 element of the @xmath47 row @xmath126 of the matrix @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "we can express this element @xmath126 with a sum of some appropriate products . in every such product",
    "we multiply one element from each matrix @xmath129 @xmath130 .",
    "( in the notation the index @xmath131 appears as the last index . )",
    "furthermore the index of the column of a term must equal with the index of the row of the following term in every such product .",
    "( therefore a term of the form @xmath132 or @xmath133 follows the term of the form @xmath132 or @xmath134 . )",
    "the row index of the first term is @xmath135 , the column index of the last term is @xmath136 . the matrices @xmath137 are upper triangular matrices , hence the row index of every term of every product is less than or equal to the column index .",
    "( thus for every term of the form @xmath133 , that are above the diagonal , we have @xmath138 . )",
    "thus the @xmath46 element of the @xmath47 row @xmath126 of the matrix @xmath139 is a sum of products of @xmath125 terms such that    * the row index of the first term is @xmath135 , the column index of the last term is @xmath136 ; * the column index of every term equals to the row index of the next term ; * the row index of a term is at most the row index of the next term .",
    "notice , that every @xmath125-term product is uniquely determined by those terms where the row index differs from the column index .",
    "let two such consecutive terms of the product be @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "( here @xmath142 and @xmath143 . ) the product of the terms between these two terms have row and column index @xmath144 and their last index is more than @xmath145 and less than @xmath146 .",
    "thus between the terms @xmath140 and @xmath141 can only be the product @xmath147 .",
    "thus formula   is proved .",
    "now , we calculate the length of formula  .",
    "formula   is a sum of products .",
    "the length of every product is @xmath125 , thus we need to calculate the number of products .",
    "notice , that every product is uniquely determined by the column indices of the terms . more exactly we need to know the column indices of the first @xmath148 terms , because the column index of the last term is @xmath136 .",
    "we can choose these indices from the set @xmath149 .",
    "the order of the selected elements does not matter . we only need to determine how many indices are equal to @xmath135 or to @xmath150 , etc , or to @xmath151 .",
    "thus we need to choose @xmath148 element from a set of @xmath152 elements such that repetitions are allowed .",
    "hence the number of products is @xmath153 since every product has length @xmath125 , the length of @xmath126 is @xmath154 thus the length of @xmath126 is at most @xmath155 for every index @xmath156 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a semipattern group .",
