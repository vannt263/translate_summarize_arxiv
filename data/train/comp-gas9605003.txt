    "the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) method is an increasingly popular method of computational fluid dynamics . as an extension of the lattice gas cellular automaton @xcite ,",
    "this method simulates fluid motion by following the evolution of a prescribed boltzmann equation instead of solving the navier - stoke equations . at the macroscopic level",
    ", it has been proved that the navier - stokes equations can be recovered from the boltzmann equation .",
    "there have been many publications on this subject , and interested readers are referred to these publications @xcite and the references therein for the history , background and details of this method .",
    "recently , convincing numerical simulations have shown that the lbe method can simulate fluid flow at high reynolds number with very good accuracy @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the lbe method is that , since it deals with the distribution functions , microscopic physical interactions of the constituent fluid particles can be conveniently incorporated .",
    "for complex fluid flows with interfaces between multiple phases and phase transitions , the complex macroscopic behavior is the consequence of the interactions between the fluid particles . since the early stage of the development of the lattice gas and lattice boltzmann method ,",
    "considerable effort has been invested in incorporating particle interactions into the lattice models so that complex fluid behavior including multiphase flows can be simulated . rothman and keller @xcite developed the first lattice gas model for two immiscible fluids . a boltzmann version was formulated later @xcite . in this scheme , the particle distributions of the two species are rearranged in the interfacial region in a way dependent on concentration gradients .",
    "the same idea was also used to reduce the diffusivity in a miscible two - component system @xcite .",
    "flekky introduced another two - component lbe model of two miscible components @xcite , in which the sum of the distribution functions of the two components and the difference of them are made to relax at difference rates to the specified distribution functions so that the diffusivity is independent of the viscosity of the fluid mixture . in another lattice gas model of liquid - vapor phase transition @xcite ,",
    "the long - range interaction was introduced by exchanging momentum over several lattice spacings .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    ", we presented an lbe model for multiple component systems which includes interactions between particles of the same and different components .",
    "an interaction potential is defined for each of the components , and an additional momentum exchange is introduced as the consequence . by considering nearest - neighbor interactions only , we were able to alter the equation of state of the fluid to a general class of functional form , allowing the simulation of non - ideal gases and their mixtures . with this model",
    ", we can simulate the motion of the interfaces and mass transfer between different phases .",
    "the components in the system can be completely miscible or partially immiscible depending on the temperature and the relative strengths of the interactions . given the interaction potentials , we have also analytically obtained the coexistence curve , the density profile across a liquid - vapor interface , and the surface tension @xcite .    in many real - world multiphase problems , mass transfer in the presence of external forces is involved .",
    "an example is the centrifugal separation of components of a fluid mixture . in centrifugal separation , a large acceleration is applied to the fluid mixture and the particles of different components diffuse through the mixture at different rates .",
    "moreover , when dealing with problems involving phase transitions such as dissolution and evaporation , the boundaries of the flow field usually move . because the lattice boltzmann method treats the multiphase problem using a single equation , many complicated effects can be naturally integrated into the algorithm .    before the lbe model can be used to quantitatively simulate complex fluid flow problems",
    ", we must have a thorough understanding of the behavior of the model itself .",
    "it is essential that the physical parameters of real systems can be matched . in a previous publication @xcite , we derived the macroscopic equations for the multiple component lattice boltzmann model and obtained the mutual diffusivity in a binary mixture by calculating the decay rate of an infinitesimal concentration perturbation .",
    "we found that the diffusivity depends on the collision times , the concentrations of the components , and the interaction potentials in a complicated way .",
    "the diffusivity can be tuned to be arbitrarily close to zero and even negative .",
    "in this paper , we provide a detailed study of diffusion in the multiple component lbe model including interparticle interactions and external forces . compared with other lbe miscible model , the current scheme has the following features .",
    "first of all , the diffusion in this model is galilean invariant .",
    "the diffusivity is independent of the flow velocity .",
    "second , multiple diffusion in a system with arbitrary number of components can be simulated .",
    "third , since the constituent components can be either miscible or immiscible to each other depending on the interaction force , this model can be used to simulate diffusion in a multiphase system with mass transfer between different phases . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly review the multiple component non - ideal gas lattice boltzmann model and give the macroscopic fluid equations satisfied . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "mass fluxes are calculated using the same chapman - enskog technique that we previously developed .",
    "the effects of different mechanisms which drive the diffusion are identified and the multiple diffusion coefficients are obtained .",
    "the results are further confirmed by numerical simulation of a few analytically solvable limiting cases . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we give the conclusion and offer some more discussion on simulation of multiple component systems with this model .",
    "for completeness , we briefly review the lbe model for a multiple component fluid mixture with interparticle forces @xcite . consider a lattice gas system in @xmath0-dimensional space with particles of @xmath1 components moving from one lattice site to its @xmath2 nearest neighbors and colliding with each other at lattice sites at each time step .",
    "the particles of the @xmath3th component have the molecular mass , @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution function of the particles of the @xmath3th component is assumed to evolve according to the following boltzmann equation : @xmath5\\label{eq : lbe}\\ ] ] where , @xmath6 is the set of vectors of length @xmath7 pointing from @xmath8 to its @xmath2 neighbors ; @xmath9 is the population of the particles of component @xmath3 having velocity @xmath10 at lattice site @xmath11 and time @xmath12 .",
    "the collision term on the right - hand side takes the form of single - relaxation - time for each component .",
    "this collision term has the bgk form , named after bhatnagar gross and krook @xcite .",
    "it can be efficiently implemented on computers .",
    "it has been shown that with a properly chosen distribution function , @xmath13 , the correct navier - stokes equation can be recovered from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lbe ] ) at the macroscopic level @xcite .    for the multiple component lbe model , we chose @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number density of the @xmath3th component .",
    "the functional form @xmath16 is the same one that yields the correct navier - stokes equations for a single component lbe model . for simplicity",
    ", we chose @xmath17 in previous publications .",
    "this choice is not required to obtain the navier - stokes equations .",
    "we will allow @xmath18 to be different for for each component .",
    "the parameters , @xmath19 , in the above distribution function are chosen to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the density of the @xmath3th component and @xmath22 is the total external force acting on particles of the @xmath3th component .",
    "@xmath22 includes both external forces and interparticle forces . with @xmath23",
    "so chosen , at every site and for every collision step , each component gains an additional momentum @xmath22 due to external and interparticle forces . in the absence of any additional forces ,",
    "all the components are assumed to have a common averaged velocity @xmath24 .",
    "it follows from the requirement that the total momentum must be conserved at each collision when @xmath25 that @xmath26 in general , this averaged velocity is different , and should be carefully distinguished , from the fluid velocity which represents the overall mass transfer .    in previous publications @xcite",
    ", we incorporated an interparticle force between the particles at sites @xmath8 and @xmath27 .",
    "this interparticle force is proportional to the product of a function of the particle number densities , @xmath28 where , @xmath29 is the green s function which satisfies @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a function of the number density which plays the role of an interaction potential .",
    "the form of this function directly determines the equation of state , as will be seen later .",
    "@xmath32 is the external force acting on the @xmath3th component , and it can be different for each component . if only nearest - neighbor interactions are included , the above expression becomes @xmath33    with the forces @xmath22 included , the sum of the momenta of all the components is not conserved at each site by the collision operator , although the total momentum of the whole system is still rigorously conserved .",
    "since the macroscopic fluid velocity of the mixture , @xmath34 , represents the over - all mass transfer rate , it should be defined by the total momentum averaged before and after each collision @xcite .",
    "a chapman - enskog expansion procedure can be carried out to obtain the following momentum equation for the fluid mixture as a single fluid : @xmath35 where , @xmath36 is the total density of the fluid mixture , and @xmath37 is the _ mass fraction _ of component @xmath3 . the pressure @xmath38 is given by the following non - ideal gas equation of state : @xmath39 .",

    "( [ eq : p ] ) in this case can then be written as @xmath42 without losing generality , we treat the @xmath18 as arbitrary constants .    with each component",

    "( [ eq : mass ] ) , which represents the diffusion of the component @xmath3 , is zero , so that the continuity equation for the whole fluid is satisfied .",
    "generally , in the presence of large - scale fluid motion , the diffusion of the components through each other is coupled to the large - scale flow .",
    "the evolution of each component is governed by the most general macroscopic fluid equations ( [ eq : mass ] ) and ( [ eq : ns ] ) . however , in many cases the fluid is at rest except for the motion caused by the diffusion of the different components .",
    "we will discuss in detail the diffusion in a fluid mixture in next section .",
    "the components of a fluid mixture are said to be diffusing into each other if the mean velocities of the components differ .",
    "the local velocity of the fluid mixture can be defined in several different ways : by averaging the velocities of the constituents by mass , mole or volume @xcite .",
    "the diffusion velocities are then defined relative to this local velocity .",
    "mathematically , all the averaging methods are equally useful in describing the diffusion of the constituents . following the treatment in chapman and cowling @xcite",
    ", we use the _ mass fluxes _ of the components in our calculation . here again , since the momentum of each component changes at each collision , to obtain the over - all mass flux , we must average before and after collisions ( cf .",

    "noticing that the right - hand - side terms of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) are exactly what the divergence operator acts on in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) , we can simply re - write eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) as the continuity equation of the @xmath3th component @xmath49 we have therefore demonstrated that each component satisfies its own continuity equation at the second order .    following the convention in the diffusion literature , we define the mass flux of component @xmath3 as @xmath50 .",
    "obviously we have @xmath51 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) , we can attribute the generation of the mass flux @xmath52 to three different driving mechanisms : the concentration gradients , the pressure gradient , and the inequality of the external forces acting on different components .",
    "the diffusions driven by these driving mechanisms are called the _ ordinary diffusion _ , _ pressure diffusion _ , and the _ forced diffusion _ respectively .",
    "it is convenient to separate the effects of the different diffusions from each other by decomposing the mass flux into its corresponding parts @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are respectively the mass fluxes associated with ordinary , pressure and forced diffusions .",
    "the mass flux corresponding to the forced diffusion , @xmath57 , can be separated most easily from the others by collecting in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) the terms containing @xmath32 .",
    "the result is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the usual kronecker delta .",
    "the mass flux of component  @xmath3 depends on forces on all the components .",
    "it can be shown that the sum of @xmath57 over all the components vanishes .",
    "if all the @xmath60 are the same as in the case where gravity is the only external force , all the @xmath56 vanish .",
    "therefore , forced diffusion only occurs when the external forces applied to all the components are not equal .",
    "an example of such a system is a mixture of differently charged particles in external electric field .",
    "in addition , when all the @xmath61 are equal , the @xmath57 can also be simplified : @xmath62    after the separation of @xmath57 , the terms remaining in eq .",

    "the second term is the potential part due to interactions . since variations in both the mass fraction and",
    "the pressure will cause density variations , to separate the effects of the mass fraction variation and the pressure variation , we must write the mass flux in terms of the gradients of the mass fraction and the pressure . using the definition @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) can be written as @xmath67 by taking the gradient of eq .",

    "noting that @xmath73 , the mass flux of component @xmath3 can be written as being dependent on the mass fraction gradients of all but the @xmath3th component .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : jg ] ) and ( [ eq : jx])([eq : jp ] ) , we computed the contributions to the mass flux from the three mechanical driving forces . except for thermal diffusion , this lbe model has the correct types of diffusion behavior compared with the continuum theory of diffusion @xcite .",
    "the reason for the lack of thermal diffusion is that this current model assumes that the temperature is a constant and independent of space .",
    "ordinary diffusion given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : jx ] ) has rather complicated dependence on the gradients of all the concentrations .",
    "we have analytically given the multiple diffusion coefficients in terms of the interaction potential @xmath74 , the collision interval @xmath61 , the constants @xmath75 which defines the mole volume of each components in ideal gas limit , and the mass fractions @xmath76 .",
    "the multiple diffusion coefficients are concentration - dependent , and can be theoretically adjusted to simulate specific material properties .",
    "this lbe model also exhibits a pressure diffusion phenomenon . depending upon the parameters , when a pressure gradient is applied to the mixture",
    ", there could be net fluxes of individual components in an originally homogeneous mixture .",
    "we can therefore use this model to study problems such as centrifuge separation .",
    "when different external forces are applied to the individual components in the mixture , an originally homogeneous mixture will separate so that concentration gradients will be generated to balance the effect of the forced diffusion .",
    "while all these different types of diffusion occur in the lbe system , the mixture satisfies the navier - stokes equations as a single fluid .    the diffusion mass fluxes given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jg ] ) and ( [ eq : jx])([eq : jp ] ) are for the most general case and are valid for systems with an arbitrary number of components and for arbitrary forms of interaction potentials , as long as the interaction is not so strong that the components become immiscible and segregate into different phases . since the coefficients have a complicated dependence on the parameters and the densities themselves , analytical solutions of the densities are generally difficult to obtain even in the `` static '' case .",
    "we will discuss a few limiting cases in which the density distributions can be analytically solved and compare the results with those from numerical simulations .",
    "we will derive the mutual diffusivity in a binary mixture ( @xmath77 ) using the mass flux obtained above and compare it with previous results .",
    "for a binary fluid mixture , fick s first law of diffusion can be stated in our notation : @xmath78 which gives the definition of the mutual diffusivity @xmath79 . since @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , after some tedious algebra , eq .",

    "this result has been confirmed by measurement of the actual decay rate of a concentration wave in numerical simulations with the lbe code @xcite .",
    "the derivation here is more general in the sense that no linearization of equations is required .",
    "a mixture of ideal gases can be simulated by setting @xmath83 , and choosing the constants @xmath84 so that @xmath85 . in this case",

    "if the @xmath84 are all equal , we can verify using eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) that @xmath87 , and therefore the mass fluxes @xmath55 vanish identically .",
    "this implies that for an ideal gas mixture , pressure diffusion occurs if and only if the components of the mixture have different molecular weights .",
