    "over recent years holographic techniques originating from the ads / cft duality , and first developed in string theory , have been used to analyze models that may be in the same universality class as many highly correlated systems .",
    "thanks to such approaches , challenging questions about dynamics in quantum phases of matter at strong coupling can be mapped to processes in theories of gravity that are tractable .",
    "thus , holography provides a window into the often unconventional physics of these systems .",
    "inhomogeneities , striped phases and competing orders are believed to play an important role in the rich phase structure of high @xmath1 superconductors  @xcite . in certain regions of the phase diagram  such as the pseudo - gap regime  many of these orders appear to be intertwined and sometimes have comparable strengths and common origin . here",
    "we focus on a particular broken - symmetry phase , the pair - density wave ( pdw )  @xcite , in which charge density wave ( cdw ) and superconducting ( sc ) orders are intertwined in a very specific way , and in which spin density wave ( sdw ) order can also play a role .",
    "pdw phases seem to be a robust feature of models of strongly correlated electrons including high @xmath1 superconductors , and there is experimental evidence that they appear at least in the cuprate la@xmath2ba@xmath3cuo@xmath4  @xcite .    in this paper we construct and study a holographic model which exhibits either pdw or co - existing sc+cdw orders , depending on the parameters in the theory . to our knowledge this is the first holographic setup to realize a pdw . while both pdw and sc+cdw break translational invariance and a @xmath0 symmetry spontaneously , there is a key difference between them . in a pdw",
    "the superconducting order parameter varies periodically as a function of position , but does so with a zero average ,  _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , in such a phase the charge density , which is also modulated , has a period which is  _ half _ of that of the scalar condensate , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath6 . in contrary",
    ", a sc+cdw state has a uniform component to the condensate , which oscillates at the same frequency as the charge density .    in our construction",
    "the @xmath0 and translational symmetries are broken spontaneously at the same time .",
    "the set - up we adopt includes , in addition to gravity , two real scalar fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 and two vector fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the couplings between the scalars and the gauge fields can be generated via the stckelberg mechanism .",
    "indeed , our theory is not of the form of the standard holographic superconductor  @xcite , but rather falls within the  _ generalized _ class of models advocated for in  @xcite .",
    "the more general structure of the scalar couplings allows us to break the desired symmetries without the need to introduce additional fields .    here",
    "the presence of two vector fields ( and the interaction between them ) is crucial for obtaining the symmetry breaking features we are after .",
    "the role of the gauge field @xmath9 is transparent , since it provides a finite charge density @xmath11 whose modulations agree with the behavior of a pdw or cdw state .",
    "what distinguishes whether the system is described by a pdw or by sc+cdw is whether the scalar @xmath7 is charged or not under the second vector field @xmath10 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath10 depends on details of the model .",
    "in particular , when the field is massless it can be associated with spin degrees of freedom , and the modulations in its density @xmath12 could characterize sdw order .    before discussing our model we should mention that striped orders in holographic superconductors have been studied in a variety of setups , starting with  @xcite , in which an inhomogeneous phase was sourced by a modulated chemical potential .",
    "there have been many generalizations since then .",
    "in particular , a study of backreaction in the presence of a periodic potential was initiated in  @xcite .",
    "however , in these setups the breaking of translational invariance was explicit and not spontaneous .",
    "holographic superconductors with spontaneously generated helical structure were reported in  @xcite .",
    "the competition between superfluid and striped phases has been examined within the context of holography , see  @xcite for top - down models .",
    "the spontaneous formation of striped order in a holographic model with a scalar coupled to two @xmath0 gauge fields was first studied in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite ( note that these models preserve the @xmath0 symmetry ) .",
    "here we have extended such constructions by simultaneously breaking both symmetries spontaneously , and focusing on the differences between a scalar condensate with pdw vs. cdw order .",
    "moreover , we have recently seen in a number of holographic models of strongly correlated electrons the advantage of using multiple vector fields , as they typically lead to richer physics ,  _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , such a picture was used to construct phase diagrams that are similar to those of high @xmath1 superconductors as well as other strange metal materials in  @xcite .",
    "our construction provides a further example of this idea . note that while in our analysis the mass of the vector @xmath10 does not affect any of the physics in a qualitative way , it is expected to play a role for applications to transport .",
    "it would be interesting to study the effects of disorder on the pdw state , as well as the consequences of stripe order on the conductive properties of the system and on fermion spectral functions .",
    "we leave these questions to future work . a more detailed analysis for this model will appear in  @xcite .",
    "we choose our theory @xmath13 to describe gravity coupled to two real scalar fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and two vector fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 denoting the field strengths of the two vectors , and @xmath17 for short .",
    "we take the gauge field couplings @xmath18 to depend on @xmath7 , and in particular chose them so that in the limit @xmath19 they take the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 constants .",
    "we note that the @xmath22 parameter which controls the interaction @xmath23 between the two fluxes will play a crucial role in the breaking of translational invariance .",
    "while in general we will assume that @xmath7 is charged under both @xmath0 fields , we will see that the @xmath24 case plays a special role , as it is associated with a pdw condensate . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath25 will describe a state with sc+cdw order .",
    "finally , note that while the current dual to @xmath9 is conserved , the same is not always true for the current dual to @xmath10 , because of the mass term @xmath26 .",
    "although in this paper we consider both massless and massive cases for the sake of completeness , they lead to the same qualitative results . on the other hand the mass parameter @xmath26 is expected to affect _",
    "e.g. _ the transport properties of the system , which we plan to study in future work .",
    "we are interested in considering two classes of background solutions to this system .",
    "the first one is the electrically charged ads reissner - nordstrm ( ads - rn ) black brane only supported by @xmath9 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the horizon , @xmath29 the chemical potential and other fields are trivial .",
    "this background will describe the high temperature phase in which the dual theory possesses a global @xmath0 symmetry , associated with the gauge field @xmath9 .",
    "the black brane temperature reads @xmath30 , and in the extremal limit @xmath31 the near horizon geometry becomes that of @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the @xmath35 radius @xmath36",
    ".    we will then examine solutions with a non - trivial profile for @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "these will describe the formation of a scalar condensate in the low temperature regime of the dual field theory , and provide holographic probes of phases with a broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "moreover , by allowing for modes which source spatial modulations , we will trigger instabilities to striped superconducting phases .",
    "the detailed structure of the modulations of the condensate and charge densities will be sensitive to @xmath37 as well as the parameters in the theory , as we will see shortly .",
    "to determine whether in this model we can spontaneously break translational invariance at the same time as the @xmath0 symmetry , we need to examine the spatially modulated static mode in the spectrum of fluctuations around the unbroken phase",
    ". our strategy will be to first consider instabilities arising from the ir @xmath32 geometry , and to construct analytically momentum - dependent modes which violate the ir @xmath35 bf bound .",
    "the presence of such modes is a strong indication that there should be a region in which one has superconducting order that is spatially modulated  a striped superconductor .",
    "we will then move on to studying numerically the behavior of the perturbations and of the condensate at finite temperature .",
    "we are now ready to examine instabilities of the electrically charged ads - rn black blane  .",
    "we start from the @xmath32 background   which arises as the ir limit of the zero temperature ads - rn geometry , and turn on the following two spatially modulated perturbations , @xmath38 where we have relabeled @xmath39 for convenience , and @xmath40 is a formal perturbative expansion parameter . by substituting into the equations of motion and working at linear level in @xmath40 , we obtain the two coupled equations @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath21 as defined in equation  .",
    "we make the further ansatz @xmath43 where @xmath44 are constants and @xmath45 denotes the scaling dimension of an ir operator in the one - dimensional cft dual to the @xmath35 geometry .",
    "the linearized equations can then be written in matrix form , solving which we find @xmath46 with & & m_^2 = + & & where we have fixed the chemical potential to be @xmath47 .",
    "the onset of the instability associated with the violation of the @xmath35 bf bound is linked to @xmath45 becoming imaginary , _ i.e. _ when @xmath48 . for striped instabilities ,",
    "one needs a non - zero wave number @xmath49 at which the value of @xmath45 is imaginary , for a fixed choice of lagrangian parameters . by inspecting the form of @xmath50 , one can check explicitly that this is clearly possible for various parts of the parameter space . as a specific example , for the parameters chosen in the finite temperature analysis below ( _ e.g. _ @xmath51 ) , we find a momentum range @xmath52 in which the modes violate the bf bound , and are associated with spatially modulated phases .",
    "we come back to this point in greater detail in the numerical analysis below .",
    "the instabilities of the ir @xmath35 solutions that we have just discussed occur at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , they suggest that analogous instabilities should appear in the black brane background   at finite temperature .",
    "next , we shall calculate the critical temperature @xmath1 below which the ads - rn geometry becomes unstable , as a function of wave number @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , if the scalar field instabilities are associated with a finite value of @xmath49 , we will have found a striped condensate .",
    "note that to obtain @xmath1 it is sufficient to work to linear order in perturbations .    motivated by the @xmath35 analysis , we turn on the same fluctuations as in  . by expanding around the ads - rn background ,",
    "one then obtains two coupled linear odes , @xmath53 which can be solved numerically .",
    "we demand the fluctuations to be regular at the horizon at @xmath54 , with @xmath55 on the other hand their @xmath56 uv expansion is @xmath57 where the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the scaling dimensions of the scalar operator dual to @xmath7 and vector operator dual to @xmath10 . since we are only interested in breaking both symmetries spontaneously , we turn off the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which correspond to the sources for the operators in the dual field theory .    after fixing theory parameters , for a given wave number @xmath49 we expect there to be a normalizable zero mode appearing at a particular temperature .",
    "we choose the @xmath7 mass term to be @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 , and consider two separate cases for the second vector field @xmath10 .",
    "we first take it to be massless , @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 and the associated current is conserved .",
    "we then consider the case in which it is massive , choosing @xmath66 in our numerics , corresponding to @xmath67 .     with @xmath68",
    ", while the dashed red line the massive case @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "right panel : dependence on the coupling @xmath22 . from top",
    "to bottom @xmath71 . in both figures",
    "the remaining parameters are chosen to be @xmath72.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath68 , while the dashed red line the massive case @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "right panel : dependence on the coupling @xmath22 . from top",
    "to bottom @xmath71 . in both figures",
    "the remaining parameters are chosen to be @xmath72.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for both scenarios we see the onset of a phase transition , as shown by the formation of a scalar condensate at @xmath1 .",
    "we show the dependence of the temperature on wave number in fig .  1 . in particular , the curves in the left panel exhibit clearly the bell curve behavior",
    " the fact that they are peaked at non - zero values of @xmath49 shows that the condensate is driven by the momentum - dependent spatial modulations .",
    "the right panel of fig .  1 shows the dependence of @xmath1 on the strength @xmath22 of the coupling @xmath73 between the two gauge fields .",
    "we would like to point out that as this coupling decreases , the effect of the spatial modulation also decreases ",
    "one may still have a superconducting instability , but not striped .",
    "thus , in this model in order to ensure that the phase transition indeed occurs at finite values of @xmath49 , the coupling must be non - zero and in fact sufficiently large .",
    "however , when @xmath74 becomes too large the instability once again disappears  the bf bound can no longer be violated .",
    "in our model at low temperatures the scalar operator @xmath75 dual to @xmath7 acquires a spatially modulated expectation value spontaneously , breaking the @xmath0 symmetry . thus , the spatially modulated phase is always associated with a non - vanishing superconducting condensate . moreover , the `` charge '' density @xmath12 associated with @xmath10 becomes spatially modulated , and this , in conjunction with @xmath76 , induces a modulation in the charge density @xmath11 dual to @xmath9 . while the second gauge field @xmath10 does not determine the type of order ( pdw or sc+cdw ) developed in the system , it can in principle be associated with spin degrees of freedom , with its modulated density @xmath12 describing sdw order .",
    "as we have already mentioned , in a system with pdw order    * the average value of the superconducting order parameter @xmath77 vanishes * the charge density oscillations have half the period of those of the scalar condensate    thus , a pdw differs from a state with co - existing sc+cdw orders , in which the scalar condensate has a uniform component . in our holographic model",
    "both of these features can be reproduced , along with the spontaneous  and simultaneous  breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry and of translational invariance . in particular , we find that when @xmath24 the scalar condensate and the charge density @xmath11 associated with the first vector field @xmath9 satisfy the conditions required for pdw order . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath25 we find a state with sc + cdw order .",
    "we have studied backreaction in our system numerically , focusing on the behavior of the scalar condensate @xmath76 and of the two charge densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we work in the grand canonical ensemble by setting @xmath47 and as an example , we choose the parameters in ( [ coupling ] ) to be @xmath78 .",
    "we focus on the branch of solutions with @xmath79 and find a second order phase transition at @xmath80 . to gain intuition for our results , one can compare our numerics with a next - to - leading order perturbative analysis in @xmath40 , which in our case can be taken to be @xmath81 and measures how close @xmath82 is to @xmath1 , @xmath83\\ , , { \\nonumber}\\\\   & & \\delta b_t = \\varepsilon\\ , b_t(r)\\cos(k\\,x)+\\varepsilon^2[b_{t}^{(1)}(r)+ b_{t}^{(2)}(r)\\cos(2k\\,x)]\\ , ,   { \\nonumber}\\\\   & & \\delta a_t = \\varepsilon^2[a_{t}^{(1)}(r)+ a_{t}^{(2)}(r)\\cos(2k\\,x)]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we are singling out the perturbations of the scalar and vector fields for the sake of space .",
    "we find that the order @xmath84 components of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are sourced by @xmath87 terms proportional to @xmath88 , and therefore vanish when @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , note that this implies that the homogenous perturbations @xmath89 and @xmath90 both vanish when @xmath24 , causing the scalar condensate @xmath77 modulations ( which to leading order are @xmath91 ) to average out to zero . note that by the same argument the oscillations of the charge density @xmath92 also average out to zero .",
    "their period agrees with that of the scalar condensate , which is consistent with sdw order in a pdw . on the other hand , since we are working at finite charge density with respect to @xmath9 , the charge density @xmath11 always has a uniform component in our model .",
    "thus , the perturbative analysis suggests that the system behaves like a pdw when @xmath24 ( no uniform component to @xmath77 ) , while when @xmath25 it describes a sc+cdw state ( the uniform contribution  @xmath93 is sourced ) .",
    "this behavior is precisely confirmed by our numerics , as visible clearly in fig .  2 , which shows the oscillatory pattern of the scalar condensate @xmath77 when @xmath24 ( solid line ) versus @xmath94 ( dashed line ) .",
    "in the former case the average value of the order parameter vanishes , but not in the latter .    .",
    "the solid blue curve corresponds to @xmath24 , while the dashed purple line to @xmath95 .",
    "the two horizontal lines denote the average values of the condensate in each case .",
    "note that the average is zero only for @xmath24 . ]    in order to have pdw order the period of the charge density must be one half of that of the scalar condensate .",
    "this is precisely what happens in our model when @xmath24 , as shown in fig .  3 , where we clearly see that @xmath11 ( dashed line ) oscillates twice as fast as the scalar condensate ( solid line ) .",
    "( dashed purple line ) associated with the @xmath9 gauge field , plotted against the scalar condensate ( solid blue line ) for @xmath24 .",
    "the period associated with @xmath96 is one half of that of the scalar condensate .",
    "we have chosen @xmath97 . ]",
    "this result , which we have found numerically , can also be understood by inspecting the @xmath98 term in the perturbation @xmath99 , which is sourced by the product of the two @xmath100 terms in @xmath101 and @xmath102 . since",
    "the oscillation of @xmath11 is a next - to - leading order effect , which is sourced by the leading order oscillations of @xmath7 and @xmath103 , this particular feature of the pdw order is in some sense  _",
    "induced_. we have also verified that for @xmath24 the frequency of the oscillations of the density @xmath12 is one half of that of @xmath11 .",
    "we note that a similar doubling of frequencies was also seen in @xcite in the behavior of the magnetization densities .    on the other hand , when @xmath25",
    "the frequency of the oscillations of @xmath11 is the same as that of the condensate , which now has a uniform component .",
    "thus , what we have is a co - existing sc+cdw state , and not a pdw .",
    "this is shown clearly in fig .  4 , in which @xmath11 and @xmath77 have the same period . from the next - to - leading order perturbative analysis",
    "this is not quite clear .",
    "however , a @xmath104 mode is expected to appear at @xmath105 from the terms @xmath106 or @xmath107 which are present when @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , we have confirmed this in our numerics .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this system will appear in  @xcite , where we will include the behavior of the background geometry and the thermodynamics .",
    "while in this paper the matter content was chosen for its simplicity , more complicated models with additional fields can in principle be constructed , in which the superconducting state is associated with the condensation of a  _ complex _ scalar . moreover , at very low temperatures the physics encoded in this model may be richer than what our preliminary analysis has shown .",
    "a very interesting question is that of the nature of the ground state once striped superconducting order develops . finding the fully backreacted geometry at zero temperature remains a challenge .",
