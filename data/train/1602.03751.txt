    "in mechanical and structural systems the knowledge of all possible solutions is crucial for safety and reliability . in devices modelled by linear ordinary differential equations",
    "we can predict the existing solutions using analytical methods @xcite .",
    "however , in case of complex , nonlinear systems analytical methods do not give the full view of system s dynamics @xcite .",
    "due to nonlinearity , for the same set of parameters more then one stable solution may exist @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called multistability and has been widely investigated in all types of dynamical systems ( mechanical , electrical , biological , neurobiological , climate and many more ) .",
    "the number of coexisting solutions strongly depends on the type of nonlinearity , the number of degrees of freedom and the type of coupling between the subsystems .",
    "hence , usually the number of solutions vary strongly when values of system s parameters changes .    as an example",
    ", we point out the classical tuned mass absorber @xcite . this device is well known and widely used to absorb energy and mitigate unwanted vibrations .",
    "however , the best damping ability is achieved in the neighbourhood of the multistability zone @xcite . among all coexisting solutions",
    "only one mitigates oscillations effectively .",
    "other solutions may even amplify an amplitude of the base system .",
    "so , it is clear that only by analyzing all possible solutions we can make the device robust .",
    "similarly , in systems with impacts one solution can ensure correct operation of a machine , while others may lead to damage or destruction @xcite .",
    "the same phenomena is present in multi - degree of freedom systems where interactions between modes and internal resonances play an important role @xcite .",
    "practically , in nonlinear dynamical systems with more then one degree of freedom it is impossible to find all existing solutions without huge effort and using classical methods of analytical and numerical investigation ( path - following , numerical integration , basins of attractions ) , especially in cases when we analyse a wider range of system s parameters and we can not precisely predict the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , solutions obtained by integration may have meager basins of attraction and it could be hard or even impossible to achieve them in reality .",
    "that is why we propose here a new method basing on the idea of basin stability @xcite .",
    "the classical basin stability method is based on the idea of bernoulli trials , i.e. , equations of system s motion are integrated @xmath0 times for randomly chosen initial conditions ( in each trial they are different ) . analyzing the results we asses the stability of each solution .",
    "if there exist only one solution the result of all trials is the same .",
    "but , if more attractors coexist we can estimate the probability of their occurrence for a chosen set of initial conditions . in mechanical and structural systems we want to be sure that a presumed solution is stable and has the dominant basin of attraction in a given range of system s parameters .",
    "therefore , we build up a basin stability method by drawing values of system s parameters .",
    "we take into account the fact that values of parameters are measured or estimated with some finite precision and also that they can slightly vary during normal operation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce simple models which we use to demonstrate the main idea of our approach . in the next section we present and describe the proposed method .",
    "section 4 includes numerical examples for systems described in section 2 .",
    "finally , in section 5 our conclusions are given .",
    "in this section we present systems that we use to present our method .",
    "two models are taken from our previous papers @xcite and the third one was described by pavlovskaia et .",

    "we deliberately picked models whose dynamics is well described because we can easily evaluate the correctness and efficiency of the method we propose .",

    "the main body consists of mass @xmath1 fixed to the ground with nonlinear spring ( hardening characteristic @xmath2 ) and a viscous damper ( damping coefficient @xmath3 ) .",
    "the main mass is forced externally by a harmonic excitation with amplitude @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the absorber is modelled as a mathematical pendulum with length @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 .",
    "a small viscous damping is present in the pivot of the pendulum .    ]",
    "the equations of the system s motion are derived in @xcite , hence we do not present their dimension form .",
    "based on the following transformation of coordinates and parameters we reach the dimensionless form :    the dimensionless equations are as follows :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the frequency of the external forcing and we consider it as controlling parameter .",
    "the dimensionless parameters have the following values : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "both subsystems ( duffing oscillator and the pendulum ) have a linear resonance for @xmath16 .      as the next example we analyse a system with impacts @xcite .",
    "it is shown in figure [ fig : impact ] and consists of mass @xmath1 suspended by a linear spring with stiffness @xmath17 and a viscous damper with the damping coefficient @xmath18 to harmonically moving frame .",
    "the frame oscillates with amplitude @xmath19 and frequency @xmath20 .",

    "we take the following values of system s parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . as a controlling parameter",
    "we use the frequency of excitation @xmath5 .",
    "the last considered system consists of a beam which can move in the horizontal direction and @xmath38 rotating pendula .",
    "the beam has the mass @xmath1 and supports @xmath38 rotating , excited pendula .",
    "each pendulum has the same length @xmath6 and masses @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "we show the system in figure [ fig : beam_model ] @xcite .",
    "the rotation of the @xmath41-th pendulum is given by the variable @xmath42 and its motion is damped by the viscous friction described by the damping coefficient @xmath43 .",
    "the forces of inertia of each pendulum acts on the beam causing its motion in the horizontal direction ( described by the coordinate @xmath44 ) .",
    "the beam is considered as a rigid body , so we do not consider the elastic waves along it .",
    "we describe the phenomena which take place far below the resonances for longitudinal oscillations of the beam .",
    "the beam is connected to a stationary base by a light spring with the stiffness coefficient @xmath45 and viscous damper with a damping coefficient @xmath46 .",
    "the pendula are excited by external torques proportional to their velocities : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants .",
    "if no other external forces act on the pendulum , it rotates with the constant velocity @xmath50 .",
    "if the system is in a gravitational field ( where @xmath51 $ ] is the acceleration due to gravity ) , the weight of the pendulum causes the unevenness of its rotation velocity , i.e. , the pendulum slows down when the centre of its mass goes up and accelerates when the centre of its mass goes down .    ]",
    "the system is described by the following set of dimensionless equations :    @xmath52    @xmath53    in our investigation we analyze two cases : a system with two pendula ( where @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and with @xmath56 pendula ( @xmath57 @xmath58 ) .. the values of the parameters are as follows : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath620 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66and @xmath45 is a controlling parameter .",
    "the derivation of the system s equations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we present the transformation to a dimensionless form in appendix a.",
    "in @xcite authors present a `` basin stability '' method which let us estimate the stability and number of solutions for given values of system parameters .",
    "the idea behind basin stability is simple , but it is a powerful tool to assess the size of complex basins of attraction in multidimensional systems . for fixed values of system s parameters , @xmath0 sets of random initial conditions are taken . for each set",
    "we check the type of final attractor . based on this",
    "we calculate the chance to reach a given solution and determine the distribution of the probability for all coexisting solutions .",
    "this gives us information about the number of stable solutions and the sizes of their basins of attraction .",

    "let us assume that an attractor @xmath72 exists for @xmath73 and has a basin of attraction @xmath74 .",
    "assuming random initial conditions the probability that the system will reach attractor @xmath72 is given by @xmath75 .",

    "this    approach is appropriate if we want to get a general overview of the    system s dynamics .",
    "ii : :    in the second approach we use a narrowed set of initial conditions    that corresponds to practically accessible initial states .     in our method we chose the second approach because it let us take into account constrains imposed on the system and because in engineering we usually know or expect the initial state of the system with some finite precision .    in the classical approach of menck et .",
    "@xcite the values of system s parameters are fixed and do not change during calculations .",
    "the novelty of our method is that we not only draw initial conditions but also values of some selected parameters of the system .",
    "we assume that the initial conditions and some of the system s parameters are chosen randomly . then using @xmath0 trials of numerical simulations we estimate the probability that the system will reach a given attractor @xmath72 ( @xmath75 )",
    "the idea is to take into consideration the fact that the values of system s parameters are measured or estimated with some finite accuracy which is often hard to determine .",
    "moreover values of parameters can vary during normal operation .",
    "therefore drawing valus of parameters we can describe how a mismatch in their values influences the dynamics of the system and estimate the risk of failure .",
    "in many practical applications one is interested in reaching only one presumed solution @xmath72 , and the precise description of other coexisting attractors is not necessary .",
    "we usually want to know the probability of reaching the expected solution @xmath75 and the chance that the system behave differently . if @xmath75 is sufficiently large , we can treat the other attractors as an element of failure risk .    in our approach",
    "we perform the following steps :    i : :    we pick values of system s parameters from the set    @xmath79 .",
    "ii : :    we select the set",
    "@xmath80 so that it consists of    all practically accessible values of system s parameters    @xmath5 .",
    "this let us ensure that a given solution indeed    exists in a practically accessible range ( taking into account the    mismatch in parameters ) .",
    "iii : :    we subdivide the set @xmath81 in to    @xmath82 equally spaced subsets .",
    "the subsets    @xmath83 do not overlap and the relation    @xmath84 is always    fulfilled .",
    "iv : :    then for each subset @xmath83 we randomly pick    @xmath0 sets of initial conditions and value of the considered    parameter . for each set",
    "we check the final attractor of the system .",
    "v : :    after a suficient number of trials we calculate the probability of    reaching a presumed solution or solutions .",
    "vi : :    finally we describe the relation between the value of the system s    parameter and the `` basin stability '' of reachable solutions .",
    "    in our calculations for each range of parameter values",
    "( subset @xmath83 ) we draw from @xmath85 up to @xmath86 sets of initial conditions and parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath0 strongly depends on the complexity of the analysed system .",
    "also the computation time for a single trial should be adjusted for each system independently such that it can reach the final attractor . in general",
    ", we recommend that in most cases @xmath0 should be at least 100 .",
    "at the beginning we want to recall the results we present in our previous paper @xcite . as a a summary",
    "we show figure [ fig : two - paramters_colour ] with a two dimensional bifurcation diagram obtained by the path - following method .",
    "it gives bifurcations for varying amplitude @xmath87 and frequency @xmath9 of the external excitation ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : row bez ] ) .",
    "lines shown in the plot correspond to different types of bifurcations ( period doubling , symmetry breaking , neimark - sacker and resonance tongues ) .",
    "we present these lines in one style because the structure is too complex to follow bifurcation scenarios and we do not need that data ( details are shown in @xcite ) .",
    "we mark areas where we observe the existence of one solution ( black colour ) , or the coexistence of two ( grey ) and three ( hatched area ) stable solutions .",
    "the remaining part of the diagram ( white area ) corresponds to situations where there are four or more solutions .",
    "additionally , by white colour we also mark areas where only the duffing system is oscillating in 1:1 resonance with the frequency of excitation and the pendulum is in a stable equilibrium position , i.e. , hdp ( hanging down pendulum ) state . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the system is reduced to the oscillations of summary mass ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of system [ eq : row bez ] is time consuming and creation of figure [ fig : two - paramters_colour ] was preceded by complex analysis done with large computational effort .",
    "additionally , the obtained results give us no information about the size of the basins of attraction of each solution - which practically means that some of the solutions may occur only very rarely in the real system ( i.e. due to not accessible initial conditions ) .",
    "nevertheless , such analysis gives us an in - depth knowledge about the bifurcation structure of the system .",
    "as we can see , the range where less then three solutions exist is rather small , especially for @xmath89 . to illustrate our method of analysis , we focus on three solutions : @xmath90 oscillating resonance , hdp and @xmath91 rotating resonance assuming that only they have some practical meaning .     showing periodic oscillations and rotations of the pendulum .",
    "black colour indicates one attractor , grey colour shows two coexisting attractors ( the same as for black but with a coexisting stable steady state of the pendulum ) . in the hatched area",
    "we observe the coexistence of stable rotations and a stable steady state of the pendulum .",
    "a detailed analysis is presented in @xcite .",

    "we plot the amplitude of the pendulum @xmath97 .",
    "ranges where the diagrams differ we mark by grey rectangles .",
    "it is easy to see that there are two dominating solutions : hdp and @xmath90 internal resonance .",
    "near @xmath16 we observe a narrow range of @xmath91 and @xmath98 resonances and chaotic motion ( for details see figure 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "based on previous results we know that we detected all solutions existing in the considered range , however we do not have information about the size of their basins of attraction and coexistence .",
    "hence the analysis with the proposed method should give us new important information about the system s dynamics .",
    "contrary to the bifurcation diagram obtained by path - following in figure [ fig : tma_bif ] , we do not observe rotating solutions ( the other set of initial conditions should be taken ) .",

    "we take @xmath105 equally spaced subsets of @xmath9 and in each subset we calculate the probability of reaching a given solution . for each subset",
    "we calculate @xmath106 trials each time drawing initial conditions of the system and a value of @xmath9 from the appropriate range .",
    "then we plot the dot in the middle of the subset which indicate the probability of reaching a given solution in each considered range .",
    "lines that connect the dots are shown just to ephasize the tendency .",
    "for each range we take @xmath86 because we want to estimate the probability of a solution with small a basin of stability ( 1:1 rotating periodic solution ) .",

    "@xmath115 $ ] the probability @xmath116 is equal to unity and in the range @xmath117 $ ] it is slightly smaller @xmath118 .",
    "hence , for both subsets we can be nearly sure that the system reaches the @xmath90 solution .",
    "this gives us indication of how precise we have to set the value of @xmath9 to be sure that the system will behave in a presumed way .",
    "a similar analysis is performed for hdp .",
    "the values of probability is indicated by the red dots .",
    "as one can see for @xmath119 , @xmath120 $ ] and @xmath121 $ ] , the hdp is the only existing solution .",
