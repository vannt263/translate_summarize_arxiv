    "like other transitions , the phase transition to an incommensurate ( inc ) phase ( reviews are given by bak , @xcite selke @xcite and janssen and janner @xcite ) can be described on the phenomenological level within the frame of extended landau theory .",
    "@xcite the necessary extension consists essentially in accounting for the expansion of the free energy density as a function not only of the components of the order parameter , but also of their spatial derivatives . therefore the global free energy becomes a functional of spatially dependent components of the order parameter and the equilibrium configuration for given values of temperature and external parameters is found as a solution of a variational problem .",
    "the continuum landau theory allows a natural classification @xcite of the possible forms of the free - energy functional for an inc transition into two classes , according to whether the driving term in the free energy expansion responsible for the appearance of the incommensurate state is linear ( type i , lifshitz invariant present ) or quadratic ( type ii , no lifshitz invariant ) in the gradient of the order parameter .",
    "the properties of those two kinds of inc phases are different : for type i inc phases the lock - in transition is either continuous , or only slightly discontinuous , and approaching the lock - in temperature @xmath2 these phases exhibit the structuration of the modulated phase into discommensurations or solitons .",
    "on the other hand , the modulation of the type ii inc phase remains practically sinusoidal down to the temperature @xmath2 and the lock - in transition is always of first order .",
    "although the above statements can be considered as a rule of thumb , there are cases known where there is coexistence of solitonic and sinusoidal structural modulation .",
    "see aramburu @xcite for details .    in the following we",
    "will only be concerned with models describing type ii inc phases .",
    "landau theory has been rather successful in describing basic properties of these phases , but if one wants to have a better understanding of the true microscopic origin of the inc phase one has to go beyond this phenomenological approach .",
    "one possibility would be to study full microscopic models with realistic interactions .",
    "another approach , to which the main part of this paper will be devoted , is to study semi - microscopic models which take into account the discrete nature of the systems and discuss properties in terms of ( effective ) inter - atomic interactions .",
    "the discreteness of a lattice leads to a number of important physical consequences such as pinning of solitons in the anisotropic next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model ( see yeomans @xcite for a review ) and in the frenkel - kontorova model , @xcite and the existence of a devil s staircase ( infinite number of commensurate and incommensurate phases ) , for example found in betaine calcium chloride dihydrate ( bccd ) .",
    "@xcite within landau theory it is difficult to explain the occurrence of a specific sequence of transitions : several lock - in terms are needed then .",
    "for example , ribeiro _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite chose the magnitude of four distinct lock - in contributions to the free energy in such a way as to stabilize the four most prominent commensurate phases in bccd .",
    "furthermore , in discrete models chaotic states are possible , @xcite which may provide an alternative description of phenomena observed in for example spin glasses , superionic conductors , the magnetic system cesb and systems with pinning of charge density waves .",
    "see bak @xcite for details .    in the past few years different lattice models",
    "have been constructed , for example to describe the phase transitions in the a@xmath3bx@xmath4 family , @xcite in bccd @xcite and , more general , in crystals with @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "@xcite these models are 2-dimensional , with only nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "@xcite studied a 3-dimensional nearest - neighbor model , applicable to bccd .",
    "all these models have in common that the frustrated interaction , needed for having an incommensurate phase , comes from a nearest - neighbor mixing interaction .",
    "recent x - ray , @xcite neutron @xcite and raman @xcite experiments on the sn@xmath3p@xmath3(s@xmath6se@xmath7)@xmath8 crystal family of uniaxial ferroelectrics motivated us to study lattice models . in the composition - temperature phase diagram of this crystal family a lifshitz point is present.@xcite at this point the paraelectric phase , the ferroelectric phase and the inc phase become equal , and the boundaries separating these phases have equal derivative .",
    "such a special point was , except for some ferroelectric liquid crystals , only found in the temperature - applied magnetic field phase diagram of the magnetic compound mnp .",
    "@xcite from both experimental and theoretical point of view this uniaxial lifshitz point is interesting because critical exponents deviate @xcite from those found for ordinary critical points .",
    "this crystal family furthermore displays an interesting modulation wave vector behavior , shows cross - over effects from order - disorder to a displacive type of phase transition , @xcite and the ratio between the slopes of the soft phonon mode in the ferroelectric and paraelectric phase deviates @xcite substantially from the standard value @xmath9 .",
    "these features are much easier to understand in a lattice model than in landau theory .    the paper is arranged as follows : in section ii we present a one - dimensional model ; in many anisotropic systems , like sn@xmath3p@xmath3(s@xmath6se@xmath7)@xmath8 , the modulation wave vector is in one specific direction .",
    "the incommensurability may arise if there is frustrating interaction between nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "we discuss general features of the model . in section iii we give some exact results regarding ground state properties . in section",
    "iv we discuss the dynamics and the stability of the various phases . in section v the phase diagrams , calculated partly analytically , partly numerically , are presented .",
    "temperature effects are treated in section vi . in section vii",
    "we discuss the continuum limit of the model which gives the connection with the landau theory .",
    "we conclude and give an outlook for further research in section viii . in appendix",
    "a we give some exact results for phase boundaries and in appendix b we present the next - nearest - neighbor extension of the effective potential method for the determination of the ground state .",
    "this method was used to calculate some of the phase diagrams .",
    "in the following we will be concerned with an extension of the so - called diffour model @xcite ( discrete frustrated @xmath0 model ) , for which the potential energy can be written as @xmath10 \\big\\}. \\label{edif}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the original diffour model , or ehm ( elastically hinged molecule ) model , @xcite has @xmath11 .",
    "although in principle this model gives incommensurate ground states , the behavior of the modulation wave vector as found in experiments can not be reproduced satisfactorily by the model . in order to account for this shortcoming we supply the diffour model with a non - linear coupling to neighbors .",
    "there are several possibilities : if we restrict ourselves to fourth - order terms we can consider a term @xmath12 . the resulting model has been studied by lamb , @xcite who showed that the origin of this term is related to strain terms in the so - called magnetoelastic diffour model .",
    "another possibility would be to consider a term of the form @xmath13 . without the term mentioned above this",
    "would however be rather unphysical .",
    "instead we will choose a term of the form @xmath14 .",
    "this is the lowest - order dispersive fourth - order term , as will be shown in section vii , and can , for example , be obtained from strain terms .",
    "the order parameter @xmath15 can be , for example , a displacement , a component of the polarization @xmath16 for ferroelectric systems , a component of the magnetization @xmath17 for magnetic systems , a rotation angle or a strain component . in this article we use for convenience terms like paraelectric , ferroelectric and antiferroelectric to distinguish between different ground states .",
    "the origin of incommensurability in this model is essentially competition between interactions with nearest- and next - nearest neighbors which may lead to frustration .",
    "higher order terms are needed for stabilization .",
    "we expect that the extra fourth - order term @xmath18 has a large effect on the phase diagrams for @xmath11 . to actually determine phase diagrams it is not necessary to vary all 5 parameters @xmath19 , which can be seen as follows : by taking @xmath20 and @xmath21 we get the following renormalized parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .    for some purposes",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the potential in the following form : @xmath27 \\big\\ } , \\label{deftilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from this the connection with the annni model",
    "can easily be made .",
    "let us put @xmath33 and @xmath34 . if we now take the limit @xmath35 we end up with a model with two infinitely deep wells .",
    "the @xmath15 can only take on values @xmath36 and can thus be seen as spins .",
    "these spins are coupled to nearest - neighbors and next - nearest - neighbors via the @xmath37 and @xmath38 terms .",
    "so by increasing the depth of the double - well potential there is a crossover from displacive behavior to order - disorder behavior in the transition from the normal to the incommensurate phase .",
    "inserting @xmath39 in the above potential leads to @xmath40 \\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the diffour model ( @xmath33 ) this leads to the following symmetry : if @xmath41 is a state for @xmath42 , then @xmath43 is a state for @xmath44 with the same energy .",
    "this property can for example be seen in the ferroelectric - antiferroelectric phases .",
    "however , for @xmath45 this symmetry @xmath46 is no longer present .",
    "different ground states are possible , depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "the stationary states are solutions of @xmath47 , giving @xmath48 = 0 . \\label{statcon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we impose periodic boundary conditions @xmath49 we arrive at a set of @xmath50 coupled non - linear equations . to find the lowest - energy state for each solution and for each value of @xmath50 the potential energy has to be evaluated . for low - period commensurate states ( small values of @xmath50 ) analytic solutions of the above equation can be found . in the following , we study ( for fixed @xmath50 ) periodic solutions of ( [ statcon ] ) . for them",
    "we give the equilibrium values @xmath51 and the corresponding energy per particle @xmath52 .    in the paraelectric state @xmath53",

    "the solution of the remaining cubic equation , which can be solved exactly for given parameters , gives a @xmath69 such that @xmath67 , a true @xmath65 state .",
    "the lowest energy state for @xmath75 has @xmath76 with @xmath77 we have to keep in mind that we must satisfy @xmath63 , which is not obvious from the above expression , but comes from the analysis of the antiferroelectric state .",

    "it has the form @xmath79 .",

    "one needs 2 different values of @xmath69 : @xmath83 and for @xmath84 one needs three different values : @xmath85 , and the above method no longer works for @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , to find states with larger periods , or even incommensurate periods , we rely on numerical calculations , for which true incommensurate states of course never can be found . however , the idea is that such a state can always be arbitrary well approximated by a commensurate state with wavelength @xmath86 where @xmath87 are coprime numbers .",

    "as the model under consideration is one - dimensional with short - range interactions , there is no phase transition possible at @xmath145 .",
    "if we however consider weakly interacting linear chains in a three dimensional system , this system can be described by ( [ edif ] ) as well if we interpret the variables @xmath15 as averages over planes perpendicular to a fixed direction ( the @xmath146-axis ) .",
