    "this model assumes behavioral changes to occur with a certain _ probability _ per time unit , called the _ transition rate_. the transition rate is decomposed into    * a rate describing _ spontaneous _ behavioral changes , and * a rate describing behavioral changes due to _ pair interactions _ of individuals .",
