    "radiative decays @xmath11(where v denotes vector mesons , p denotes pseudoscalar mesons ) have attracted much interest in past decade[210 ] .",
    "the study of this kind of rare decays is important in hadron physics , both because it is intimately related to the qcd - inspired descriptions of the dynamics of mesons and because it has been urged by experiments .",
    "for example , the reaction @xmath12 poses a possible backgroud problem of @xmath13 at future @xmath7 factory . the latter process has been proposed as a way to study cp violation@xcite .",
    "the purpose of our present paper is to systematically study the processes @xmath14 , @xmath1 in the framework of u(3)@xmath2u(3)@xmath3 chiral theory of mesons@xcite . in this effective chiral model ,",
    "all couplings among pseudoscalars , and its lowest resonances are fixed by introducing an universal coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a unified description of mesons in the low energy is provided .",
    "in fact , this effective model is an extended chiral quark model including @xmath16 mesons .",
    "the chiral quark model , originated by weinberg@xcite , and then developed by manohar and georgi@xcite , provides a qcd - inspired description on the simple constituent quark model . in the view of manohar - georgi model , between the chiral symmetry breaking scale(@xmath17gev ) and the confinement scale ( @xmath18gev )",
    ", the dynamical field freedom are constituent quarks(quasi - particle of quarks ) , gluons and goldstone bosons associated with chiral symmetry spontaneously breaking . in this quasiparticle description , the effective gluon coupling is small and interactions between quarks and goldstone bosons is important .",
    "the external gauge fields(e.g . , photon field ) can be introduced by localizing the global chiral symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that in the electromagnetic interaction of mesons , the vector mesons play an essential role through vmd(vector meson dominate)@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite nature to extend chiral quark model to include spin-1 meson resonances via vmd and via minimal coupling principle",
    ".    the u(3)@xmath2u(3)@xmath3 chiral theory of mesons has been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "the basic inputs for it are the pseudoscalar decay constants @xmath19 , vector meson mass @xmath20 and a universal coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "predictions of this model are in good agreement with data@xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref.@xcite it has been shown that the low energy limit of this theory is equivalent to the chiral perturbation theory , and the qcd constraints in ref.@xcite are satisfied by this model . therefore , as an effective model of qcd , the u(3)@xmath2u(3)@xmath3 chiral theory of mesons is reliable .",
    "the content of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we present a brief review of chiral quark model and the basic notations of the u(3)@xmath2u(3)@xmath3 chiral theory of mesons . in sec.3 and sec.4 , the branch ratio for these decays are calculated respectively , and the gauge invariance of these decay amplitudes is checked explicitly .",
    "we give a summary of the results in sec.5",
    "the simplest parametrization of chiral quark model is@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are gell - mann matrices of su(3 ) , @xmath24 are fields of pseudoscalar meson octet and @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a parameter related to the quark condensate .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under global chiral symmetry transformation .",
    "the vector(@xmath27 ) and axial - vector(@xmath28 ) external field are introduced into @xmath29 due to the requirment of local chiral symmetry , i.e. , we can replace the derivative operator in eq.(1 ) by covariant derivative operator with affine connection(or gauge potential ) @xmath30 as follows : @xmath31 then we obtain a theory describing strong and elecro - weak interactions of mesons .",
    "spin-1 meson resonances can be included via vmd , i.e. , via substitution of a new affine connection @xmath32 for the former one @xmath30 in eq.(2 ) , @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35=1 , 2 , 3 and @xmath36=4 , 5 , 6 , 7 .",
    "now , the author of ref.@xcite came to this extention and proposed a lagrangian , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is photon field , @xmath39 is the electric charge .",
    "the mass term of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is chiral gauge invariant because the @xmath40 and @xmath41 transform homogeneously under local @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "note that there are no kinetic terms in eq.(5 ) for all meson fields , since they are treated as composited fields of quark fields instead of the fundamental fields .",
    "the kinetic terms for these fields will be generated via loop effects of quarks .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective lagrangian of mesons ( indicated by @xmath43 ) are obtained through integrating over the quark fields , @xmath44[d\\bar{\\psi}]{\\rm exp}\\{i\\int d^4 x { \\cal l}\\}.\\ ] ] using the dimensional regularization , and in the chiral limit , the effective lagrangian @xmath45 ( normal parity part ) and @xmath46 ( abnormal parity part ) have been evaluated in refs.@xcite .",

    "the field @xmath49 mixes with @xmath50 , which should be diagonalized conveniently via field redefinition , @xmath51 then the following equations are derived , @xmath52    it should be stressed that this field redefinition is different from the one in ref.@xcite , @xmath53 .",
    "(  [ sub ] ) keeps the chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "it plays an important role when we check the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the decay amplitude in following sections .",
    "eq.(7)-eq.(11 ) provide the formalism employed in this paper and all the calculations are performed in the chiral limit .",
    "in this section , we will restrict our calculations to the two - flavor case .",

    "one can derive from eqs.(1920 ) that @xmath63 where @xmath64 denote the momenta of @xmath65 and photon fields respectively , and @xmath66 are the polarization vectors for @xmath67 meson and photon field respectively .",

    "before we give the numerical results of the width and the branch ratio of this process , it is necessary to point out that there is no adjustable parameter in our calculation .",
    "the basic input @xmath15 , as an universal coupling constant in this theory , can be fixed by a experiment , thus we can compare our theoretical results with experimental data and give predictions for processes which have not been measured in experiments .",
    "in this paper , we take @xmath72",
    ". then we obtain , @xmath73 which compares favourably with the experimental data@xcite , @xmath74 for @xmath75mev , where @xmath76 is the photon energy in the rest frame of @xmath77 .",

    "[ figure:1(a ) ] .",
    "one can see that the experimental result is in good agreement with our theoretical expectations .",
    "the reaction @xmath78 involves only abnormal parity , the feynman diagrams is shown in fig.[figure:0(b ) ] .",
    "following ref.@xcite , by means of bosonization the quark propagator , we obtain    @xmath79    the vertex @xmath80 is obviously gauge invariant because of the totally antisymmetry tensor @xmath81 .",

    "now , we consider the transition @xmath88 .",
    "the photon in this reaction is very soft(@xmath89mev ) , so it is difficult to distinguish it from the genuine @xmath90 events which has been proposed as a way to measure the small parameter in studying cp violation .",
    "the branch ratio of @xmath91 will limit the presion of this measurment .",
    "this quantity has been predicted by several authors[4 - 10 ] . in refs.[48 ] , the contribution of interchanging the scalar meson @xmath92or @xmath93 ) has been obtained via chain reaction @xmath94 , in which the decay @xmath95 is proceeds through the charged @xmath96 loop .",
    "the uncertainty of this approach is that the coupling constant @xmath97 is not well know because of the lack of experiment data . in ref.@xcite , the non - resonant contribution has been calculated using current algebra and low energy theorem . in ref.@xcite , the authors did not introduce @xmath98 explicitly , they calculated the final state intereaction of @xmath99 system in a chiral unitary approach .",
    "this approach generates the @xmath98 meson dynamically , the obtained amplitude after summing over an infinite series diagram also contain non - resonant contribution .",
    "all these calculations , however , did not contain the contribution of an abnormal parity process via interchanging @xmath9 which in principle must be added to the resonant poles and the nonresonant smooth amplitude , otherwise one may not assume scalar meson dominance a priori .",
    "in the present paper , we provide a complete calculation on the branch ratio for this decay by including the abnormal parity process with @xmath9 pole , scalar resonance @xmath8 poles and non - resonant amplitude .",
    "the role of scalar resonance will be dealt with as in the former works[48,10 ] .",
    "the difference between their scheme and ours is that the needed vertices to calculate the loop diagram @xmath100 has been derived in eqs.(2830 ) as well as all the coupling constants has been fixed by the universal constant @xmath15 , in other words , there is no adjustable parameter in our calculation .",

    "the width and the branch ratio are given by : @xmath119 where @xmath120 . in the following numerical evaluation , the constant @xmath15",
