    "nonleptonic b meson decays pose a serious theoretical challenge to us .",
    "the main difficulty is to handle the uncertainties of low - energy qcd ; to be very precise , to calculate the long - distance contribution @xmath4 .",
    "there are at least three models with varied degrees of sophistication to tackle the said uncertainty : the conventional factorization ( cf ) model @xcite , the qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) model @xcite and the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) model @xcite .",
    "these models provide definite theoretical predictions for branching ratios ( br ) and cp asymmetries ( @xmath5 ) for nonleptonic charmless b decay modes .",
    "we still do not have comparable numbers from other approaches , _",
    "e.g. _ , the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) model @xcite , though they have predictions for some of the @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "one of the major obstacles is to calculate the strong phase , and hence the cp asymmetry , theoretically .",
    "( the direct cp asymmetry depends both on the strong phase difference and the weak phase difference of the two interfering amplitudes , and is zero if any one of them vanishes . ) the color - transparency argument of bjorken @xcite is not expected to hold beyond the color - allowed tree decays . in the cf model the strong phases are computed from the imaginary parts of the respective wilson coefficients @xcite , and no soft final - state interactions are taken into account . among the more sophisticated versions ,",
    "qcdf predicts a rather small strong phase difference between the dominant amplitudes .",
    "pqcd predictions are different as annihilation and exchange topologies are given more weightage than in qcdf ( and the penguin amplitude is also enhanced ) , and they can generate a sizable strong phase .",
    "( a comparative study of these two models can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "this is why the predictions for cp asymmetries in qcdf and pqcd are sometimes even opposite in sign .",
    "needless to say , the relative importance of different amplitudes varies from model to model .",
    "in particular , strong penguins are much larger in the pqcd model due to a dynamical enhancement .",
    "there are , however , some common trends , which can be justified even intuitively .",
    "for example , the tree - amplitude in @xmath2 dominates over the strong penguin , whereas the situation is opposite for @xmath6 .",
    "this is entirely due to the relative importance of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "all these models also agree on the fact that the electroweak penguins ( ewp ) are much smaller than the strong penguins .",
    "that can be seen very easily , by comparing the relevant wilson coefficients .",
    "intuitively , it follows from the smallness of @xmath7 compared to the strong coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , one can safely neglect all the electroweak penguins except that mediated by a top quark in the loop .",
    "however , one must remember that the strong phases coming from gluonic penguins ( which is necessarily @xmath9 ) need not be the same as those coming from @xmath10 penguins ( they do not have a definite isospin ) .",
    "again , this complication does not matter since the ewps are supposed to be very small .",
    "there is no known mechanism which can enhance the ewp amplitude to the level of , say , the corresponding gluonic penguins .",
    "the predictions from the theoretical models are supposed to be robust when both the daughter mesons are light .",
    "for example , brs and @xmath5s have been computed for all the @xmath0 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "such numbers mostly agree with each other , if we take into account the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this leads us to believe that the leading predictions of these models may be taken seriously .",
    "these include the relative importance of the tree and strong penguin amplitudes , the prediction for strong phase differences , et cetera",
    ".    however , as is well known and will be substantiated in the next section , some of the experimental numbers are at variance with the theoretical predictions , though most of them agree . in the @xmath0 sector , there are three such discrepancies : ( i ) @xmath11 is abnormally large ( the largest prediction is from pqcd , which is about 5 times less ) ; ( ii ) @xmath12 is slightly on the lower side ( the lowest prediction is again from pqcd , which is more than @xmath13 above the data ; qcdf has a large theoretical uncertainty @xcite , and taking everything into account , may just fit the data ) ; and ( iii ) the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath2 is larger than theoretical prediction , irrespective of the model chosen .",
    "one must be cautious : the error bars , particularly for the cp asymmetry data , are still large , and it may be too early to draw any definite conclusions based on them . still , the trend is worth investigating .",
    "in contrast , the individual brs and @xmath5s in the @xmath3 sector are more or less in agreement with the theory .",
    "but when one eliminates the theoretical uncertainties by taking suitable ratios of the brs , it is claimed @xcite that the ewp contribution is abnormally large .",
    "it is more puzzling since it appears that we understand the radiative decay @xmath14 fairly well ( though there are ways to evade this problem ) .",
    "we will critically investigate this issue also .",
    "it will be shown that solutions with vanishingly small ewp amplitudes can be obtained even with a rough su(3 ) flavor symmetry between the tree and the strong penguin amplitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath3 channels .",
    "the strong phase difference between these two amplitudes for @xmath3 is small ( modulo @xmath15 ) , but is different from the analogous quantity for @xmath0 decays , which is exactly what is predicted in pqcd .",
    "however , a substantially large ewp can be easily accomodated in the data .",
    "but there is no apparent conflict between the @xmath3 channels and the radiative decay @xmath14 .",
    "there are two ways of analyzing the data .",
    "first , one can take a particular model of his or her choice , and fit the data to get an idea of the relatively poorly known parameters .",
    "the trouble is that equal justice can not be done to all the experiments .",
    "( a well - known example is the pre-2003 ckmfitter fit of the @xmath2 asymmetry using the babar data only , within the context of qcdf ; the belle data was so far away that it could not be fitted . )",
    "the second approach @xcite is to analyze the data without paying any heed to the models , except , maybe , for some basic symmetry ideas like flavor su(3 ) .",
    "as expected , the fitted amplitudes and strong phases , all a priori unknown , come out to be different from the model predictions .",
    "the question is whether these discrepancies are due to the fact that we do not understand the low - energy qcd well , or whether there is new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm )",
    ". if there is np , that will generate some more effective four - fermi operators , leading to new contributions in b decays .",
    "if these operators are flavor - blind , they should mimic the strong penguins , whereas the flavor - specific operators should appear more like a modification to the tree or the ewp amplitudes . the exact structure , of course ,",
    "will depend on the specific model .",
    "unfortunately , due to lesser number of @xmath0 channels , it is not possible to extract an observable which will clearly point to some abnormality in the ewp sector , and we have to look for an indirect answer .",
    "the large br of the @xmath16 channel tells that if unknown ewp dynamics is the cause of the enhancement , the ewp amplitude should be quite large ( we will later see that it is almost as large as the color - allowed tree amplitude ) .",
    "it is difficult to have such a large amplitude from intuitive arguments .",
    "the same may be said for the @xmath3 channels .",
    "( that is why we prefer a np solution for the puzzle . )",
    "this brings us to the justification of our approach .",
    "we assume that the model predictions are sensible , as far as the tree and strong penguins ( and annihilation and exchange diagrams ) go , and as a typical example we take the pqcd model .",
    "qualitatively same results are found for other models too , but there is a reason why we choose pqcd . as we will show",
    ", a fit to the @xmath0 data needs large penguin contribution , and only pqcd can provide such a large enhancement , so that this is a more conservative approach to look for np effects .",
    "also , a large @xmath17 helps the angle @xmath18 to be fitted in the first quadrant , in accordance with the standard ckm fit @xcite . we treat the parameters of the ewp sector as unknowns , and fit them from experimental data",
    "this will show us that it is the @xmath19 sector , rather than @xmath20 , that contains the puzzling ewp behaviour ; and one should expect some deviation from the sm prediction for @xmath21 , instead of @xmath22 .",
    "we will also discuss how a large ewp amplitude can be correlated between @xmath0 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "however , the main emphasis lies elsewhere .",
    "such an analysis is the first step to look for effects coming from np , since a number of np models mimic ewp dynamics , by having unequal strength of @xmath23 and @xmath24 amplitudes .",
    "there are numerous examples , starting from models with an extra @xmath25 @xcite and/or exotic quarks ( _ e.g. _ , vector singlets ) to r - parity conserving and violating supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we do not go into any of these specific models ; this is a model - independent study to show that such models may have an interesting future .",
    "we wish to point out that this study implicitly assumes the unitarity of a @xmath26 ckm matrix ( thus , allowed ranges for the amplitudes for a model with a fourth chiral generation should be different ) .",
    "a weaker assumption is no np effect in @xmath27 mixing .",
    "such an effect modifies the phase of the @xmath27 box , and @xmath28 as measured from @xmath29 need not be the true @xmath28 .",
    "this also weakens the limits on @xmath30 .",
    "inclusion of such np effects in @xmath27 mixing does not invalidate our conclusions ; it only changes the allowed range of the angle @xmath18 of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we tabulate the experimental and theoretical inputs for the analysis .",
    "section iii and iv deal with the @xmath0 and @xmath3 data respectively . in section",
    "v , we summarize and conclude .",
    "let us first set our notations and conventions .",
    "we work in the ( @xmath31 ) convention of the ut .",
    "we use @xmath32 to indicate a flavor - untagged @xmath33 or @xmath34 , or even a charged b meson when there is no chance for confusion .",
    "the cp asymmetry for @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 which agrees with the convention of @xcite but is opposite to that used by @xcite .",
    "the same convention ( according to the quark content , @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) is used for neutral b decays to flavor - specific final states , like @xmath39 . for a flavor - nonspecific final state @xmath40 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath41 ) , we define @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 . for the @xmath41 system , they are related to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 of babar and belle by @xmath47    we also use the following valence quark convention : @xmath48 and for the antiparticles , the quark contents are just reversed , without any additional @xmath49 sign .",
    "this is different from those used by the gronau - rosner group @xcite , but is consistent with , say , @xcite . in the convention of @xcite ,",
    "the following mesons have an extra minus sign in their wavefunctions : @xmath50 .",
    "this obviously does not change the brs or @xmath5s .",
    "however , they change the amplitude sum rules .",
    "this will be discussed later in this section .",
    "the experimental data ( updated for winter 2004 ) , taken from the hfag website @xcite and quoted at 68% confidence level ( cl ) , is as follows .",
    "the brs , multiplied by @xmath51 , are @xmath52 the cp asymmetries are @xmath53    .predictions for brs ( first row , multiplied by @xmath51 ) and @xmath5s ( multiplied by 100 , and in our convention ) of different nonleptonic modes . the numbers are taken from @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are not treated equally ; in particular , qcdf pedictions take into account more sources of uncertainty than the other two .",
    "the ut angle @xmath18 is fixed to be in the first quadrant .",
    "for the modes indicated by @xmath54 , the cp asymmetry is measured with a @xmath55 in the final state . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the theoretical predictions based on different models are given in table 1 .",
    "the ` large ' brs ( _ i.e. _ , except that of @xmath1 ) more or less agree with each other ; there is a nontrivial overlap region . also to be noted that only the br of @xmath1 is _ significantly _ off the mark .",
    "the predictions for @xmath5s differ , mainly because an enhancement of penguins and annihilation topologies in the pqcd model .",
    "however , even taking into account all the theoretical uncertainties , some of the experimental resuls do not tally with the predictions .",
    "the error bars are large , and ultimately the difference might go away , but this is high time to be prepared for any indirect signal of np .",
    "let us first discuss the theory of @xmath0 .",
    "we follow the standard convention of writing the amplitudes @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , putting the top - mediated penguins together with up- and charm - mediated penguins by using the unitarity relationship @xmath56 ) except that the ewps , both color - allowed and color - suppressed , are written separately . this will help us to understand the ewp dynamics of the @xmath19 sector .",
    "the amplitudes are @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "conventionally , @xmath61 and @xmath62 contain , apart from the tree - level amplitudes , those parts of the strong penguin that are proportional to @xmath63 . for simplicity ( and also guided by intuitive arguments )",
    "we take only the top - mediated ewp amplitudes ; they are proportional to @xmath64 , and can be written in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 using the unitarity argument .",
    "note that we have extracted the strong phase associated with the leading term , since only the difference of strong phases is a measurable quantity .",
    "the annihilation contributions have been neglected , but can be suitably dumped with @xmath61 or @xmath67 . to calculate the respective brs",
    ", one has to remember that @xmath68 lives longer than @xmath33 by a factor of @xmath69 @xcite .    due to our slightly different valence quark convention",
    ", the amplitude sum rule looks like @xmath70 this convention , of course , yields identical results to that of , say , @xcite .",
    "thus , there are ten free parameters ; five amplitudes , four independent strong phase differences and the weak phase @xmath18 .",
    "the observables are far less in number : only six , namely , three brs and three cp asymmetries .",
    "one therefore can not say in a model - independent way that the ewps are going to be large .",
    "however , if one neglects the ewps , the number of free parameters gets reduced by four ( two amplitudes and two strong phases ) , so one can extract a unique solution @xcite .",
    "we , on the other hand , will take the model predictions seriously .",
    "for example , we use the pqcd prediction @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we also use the ckm fit value for @xmath18 : @xmath73 at 68% cl .",
    "this gives us three more theoretical inputs .",
    "next we come to the @xmath3 modes .",
    "one can invoke the flavor su(3 ) and relate the @xmath0 amplitudes to the @xmath3 ones .",
    "the symmetry is supposed to be broken only by the corresponding ckm factors and the ratio of the meson decay constants @xmath74 .",
    "this in turn implies that one takes the chiral enhancement factors coming from @xmath75 type operators ( @xmath76-@xmath77 in the standard literature ) to be the same in both cases .",
    "let us follow a different approach .",
    "we start with the assumption that the amplitudes are independent of each other ; later we will see whether there is any trace of the flavor symmetry . if one can relate the amplitudes by su(3 ) , that will act only as a further boost to our analysis .",
    "in fact , the pqcd relationship between the amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath67 , and the analogous one for @xmath78 transitions , @xmath79 , is consistent with the su(3 ) expectation @xmath80 where primes indicate @xmath81 transitions .",
    "note that pqcd also predicts the strong phase difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 to be about @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we , however , will not use that as an input ; rather , we will show that the allowed solutions , obtained just from fitting the data , are entirely consistent with the pqcd prediction .",
    "we use the wolfenstein representation of the ckm matrix , and define @xmath85 , and @xmath86 remember that @xmath87 is negative , hence the minus sign .",
    "we assume that there is no effect of np or unknown sm dynamics in @xmath27 mixing , and the phase from the @xmath27 box is @xmath88 , which has been directly measured as well as fitted .",
    "we use the ckmfitter fit result @xmath89 .",
    "it was discussed earlier what happens if one relaxes this assumption and allows np effects in the mixing .    the amplitudes can be written in an analogous way to that of the @xmath0 ones .",
    "there is , howver , one important difference .",
    "the modes @xmath90 and @xmath91 have no tree - level contributions . the strong penguin , which after rearrangement was absorbed into @xmath61 , now gives a different amplitude @xmath92 with a different strong phase @xmath93 ( we use primes to indicate @xmath78 transitions ) .",
    "@xmath94\\nonumber\\\\ \\sqrt{2 } a(\\bar{b}\\to \\bar{k^0}\\pi^0 ) & = &     & { } & \\left[\\bl |\\tilde c|e^{-i\\gamma}e^{i(\\d_{\\tilde",
    "c}-\\d_p ) } + { 1\\over\\bl } { 3\\over 2}|p_{ew}| e^{i(\\d_e-\\d_p)}{\\cal g}'\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above expressions , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the same as @xmath62 ( in @xmath0 ) except that there is no strong penguin ( this difference is non - negligible ) . in the last two amplitudes , there is a part where the @xmath15 is emitted from the @xmath32 meson ; this , expectedly , is very similar in structure to that of @xmath0 . in these terms , the relative sign between @xmath97 and @xmath98 terms is positive whereas in the analogous expression for @xmath0 , that is negative ; this is because @xmath87 is negative .",
    "@xmath99 is , of course , the same as that in @xmath100 .",
    "thus , there are five new amplitudes and four strong phases .",
    "the main emphasis of the @xmath0 analysis is to extract , unambiguously , a signature for large ewp amplitudes . in the sm",
    ", we expect @xmath61 to be the largest amplitude , while @xmath67 and @xmath62 are smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , models like pqcd predict @xmath101 , while the predictions from other models are generally below 10% .",
    "there is no such prediction available for @xmath62 , but one can expect @xmath102 .",
    "the ewp amplitudes are expected to be highly suppressed compared to these . the color suppression further diminishes @xmath103 compared to @xmath99 .",
    "for those readers who do not want to go through the nitty - gritties of the analysis , let us state our conclusions right here .",
    "we will see that the amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath62 turn out to be as expected ( @xmath67 is related to @xmath61 ) , and though the color - allowed ewp @xmath99 may happen to be large , there are a number of solutions ( we have more unknowns than equations , so there is a large number of possible solutions ) where this turns out to be small , almost as small as expected from the theory .",
    "later , we will see that only those small values are allowed by the @xmath3 data .",
    "the surprise comes from the color - suppressed ewp amplitude @xmath104 ; it turns out to be large , larger than @xmath67 , and almost as large as @xmath61 ! there are other interesting features of the analysis ; we discuss them at the end of this section .",
    "we start by treating all the amplitudes as free parameters , with the exception of @xmath67 .",
    "the latter is varied over its entire range allowed by the theoretical uncertainties of @xmath105 .",
    "the other four amplitudes are varied over the range 0-@xmath106 .",
    "we will see later that this is a rather conservative range .",
    "all the strong phase differences are varied over the range 0-@xmath107 , except @xmath108 , which is again constrained by the theory .",
    "the weak angle @xmath18 is varied between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    from the solutions that satisfy the experimental constraints ,",
    "we get the following ranges for the amplitudes : @xmath111 note that apart from the last line , none of these are unexpected .",
    "one may object that @xmath62 is supposed to be smaller than @xmath61 ; if we take that constraint into account nothing changes except the upper limit of @xmath62 ; it becomes @xmath112 .",
    "however , there is a concenration of solution points in the @xmath113 plane near the origin ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this vindicates the conjecture that both these amplitudes may be small .",
    "later we will see from the @xmath3 channels that the upper limit of @xmath99 is smaller than the range predicted here by about 40% .",
    "why @xmath104 is so large ?",
    "the main culprit is the @xmath1 br .",
    "this , along with the facts that the other two brs are more or less in the expected ballpark , while the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath2 is large ( _ i.e. _ , there must be a significant interfering amplitude ) generates a large @xmath104 .",
    "see fig . 2 to have an idea of the solution points for @xmath104 ;",
    "in fact , if we claim that @xmath99 is small , the range for @xmath104 becomes 2 - 3@xmath114 .",
    "this is a large amplitude by any standard , and can not be accomodated in any theoretical model .",
    "the strong phase differences do not show any interesting pattern , except , again , for @xmath115 .",
    "varied between 0 and @xmath107 , solutions come out only for the range @xmath116 . this shows a large destructive interference between @xmath104 and @xmath61 , which is necessary to reproduce the brs of @xmath2 and @xmath117 in the right ballpark .",
    "3 shows the allowed parameter space of @xmath118 versus @xmath119 ; this shows a concentration of solutions near the physical boundary @xmath120 .",
    "let us emphasize again at this point that this treatment is valid if and only if the new physics , if any , contributes to the decay but not to the @xmath27 mixing .",
    "most of the new physics models are of this type ; however , there are exceptions . for example , four - generation fermion models contribute mostly in mixing . supersymmetry with r - parity violation may contribute to only mixing , only decay , or both , depending upon the nonzero couplings chosen .",
    "generically , if np contributes in @xmath27 mixing , the following modifications have to be taken into account ( an example with r - parity violation has been exhaustively discussed in @xcite ) :    * @xmath121 is affected by np .",
    "consequently , @xmath30 , which is determined from the measurement of @xmath121 , becomes a free parameter , except for constraints coming from the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "obviously , for models with more than three quark generations , this is a very loose constraint .",
    "fortunately , the precise value of @xmath30 is not that important in our analysis .",
    "* what is more important is the value of @xmath88 .",
    "there is a sm value of @xmath28 , which let us call @xmath122 .",
    "we have explicitly assumed that the cp asymmetry in , say , @xmath29 , measures @xmath122 .",
    "if there is np in mixing , it will measure @xmath28 which should be different from @xmath122 .",
    "note that this happens even if the np mixing amplitude is real .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is important in the analysis of cp asymmetries in the @xmath2 channel . to get a feeling of @xmath122",
    ", one should perform the usual ckm fit for the vertex @xmath123 of the ut without the @xmath121 constraint . again , this is not a foolproof prescription ; one implicitly assumes that np does not contribute to , say , @xmath124 .    even considering all this",
    ", it is hard to see how a np that contributes only to mixing but not to decay can explain the @xmath0 results .",
    "it can affect the fit for @xmath18 , but can not generate a large br for @xmath1 or a large direct cp asymmetry for @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis for @xmath3 follows that of @xmath0 .",
    "there are five new amplitudes , apart from @xmath99 , and hence four new strong phase differences .",
    "we scan this ten - dimensional parameter space for possible solutions .",
    "note that @xmath125 is a small number and hence for all practical purpose @xmath126 can be approximated by unity ( but for our analysis we keep it as it is ) .",
    "also note that these ten parameters are not really all free ; the allowed range for @xmath99 , as well as the weak phase @xmath18 , are determined from the @xmath0 data , and we use the pqcd result @xmath127 .",
    "we also equate the strong phases of @xmath82 and @xmath128 .",
    "we obtain the following ranges for the amplitudes : @xmath129    there are two points to note right here .",
    "first , @xmath96 could in principle have a bigger range .",
    "we constrained it to be smaller than @xmath62 of @xmath0 modes .",
    "second , both the electroweak penguin amplitudes can be close to zero ; we refer to figure 4 for a feeling of the solutions .",
    "thus , _ there is no apparent ewp anomaly in the data_. we have explicitly checked that solutions are possible even if one puts by hand both the ewp amplitudes equal to zero .",
    "all the strong phase differences have been varied between 0 and @xmath107 .",
    "solutions are allowed for the entire range , unlike @xmath0 , where we found a rather constrained fit @xmath116 . however , from figures 5 and 6 , there appears to be an interesting correlation between the amplitudes and the strong phases .    from figure 5",
    ", it appears that small @xmath130 solutions are admitted only if @xmath83 is large : @xmath131 . for smaller values of @xmath83",
    ", @xmath130 must be large .",
    "this is intuitively clear : after all , one of them should be large enough to generate the required brs .",
    "one could have done this taking @xmath83 and @xmath82 to be free parameters ; but we wish to follow the theoretical prediction , which is also consistent with an su(3 ) flavor symmetry , as far as possible .",
    "figure 6 shows the solutions for the strong phase difference @xmath132 as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "note the band around the theoretical prediction of @xmath84 from the pqcd model , which appears only for large @xmath83 and hence small ewps .",
    "this shows that there is nothing to worry about the ewp sector ; but one can accomodate large values , which may come from np models .    thus , the su(3 ) flavor symmetry is there , as far as the magnitudes of @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are concerned .",
    "however , the strong phase differences are not necessarily small .",
    "if one demands a correlation between both the amplitudes and the strong phases for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , one must invoke large ewp contribution .",
    "but such a contribution is there for @xmath0 ; there is no a priori reason why it should not appear for @xmath3 , and thus help to salvage the flavor symmetry .",
    "we have juggled with a number of amplitudes and strong phases . the equations being horrendously coupled , we do not even envisage to attempt an analytic solution .",
    "those solutions necessarily involve some simplification and run the risk of missing the point .",
    "rather , we solved these equations numerically , and the equations being more in number than constraints ( and remember that these constraints often have large error bars ) , found a range of allowed values for the free parameters .",
    "it is indeed interesting that one can form some idea about the nature of the solutions .",
    "we assume that the theoretical models can catch the essence of these nonleptonic transitions successfully .",
    "there are points where they differ ; for example , the way how one takes care of end - point suppresions , higher - twist corrections , or annihilation topologies .",
    "fortunately , such subtleties are not really crucial for our analysis .",
    "what is important is the relative strength of the strong penguin amplitudes with respect to the tree amplitude .",
    "pqcd , by virtue of a dynamical enhancement mechanism , predicts a larger @xmath105 than other models like cf or qcdf .",
    "since our strategy is to extract the minimal set that does not fit in these model predictions , we take pqcd as our working model . if one takes , for example , qcdf , one needs a larger color - suppressed ewp to explain the @xmath0 data .",
    "pqcd also helps to fit @xmath18 in the first quadrant , which is compatible with the ckm fit .",
    "we found that the explanation of the @xmath0 data needs a large color - suppressed ewp contribution ( the color - allowed ewp may be large , but need not be ) .",
    "this is entirely due to the large br of @xmath1 .",
    "if this data would have been in the expected ballpark , the large direct cp asymmetry in @xmath2 could be explained by a much smaller ewp contribution .",
    "such a large ewp contribution also means that there should be something worth watching in @xmath136 .",
    "the situation is not so drastic for @xmath3 . even if one takes the su(3 ) predictions of @xmath83 and @xmath82",
    "seriously , there are solutions with vanishingly small ewp amplitudes .",
    "of course , there is a price to pay : the other two amplitudes @xmath96 and @xmath128 become essentially free , except for the constraints that @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we have tried to see what happens to the fit if all amplitudes and strong phases are taken from some model ( we used cf , because that predicts all the amplitudes and also the strong phases coming from the imaginary parts of the respective wilson coefficients ) , and there one indeed requires a sizable ewp contribution !",
    "so , what is the lesson from the @xmath3 analysis ?",
    "probably that it is yet early to say that there is any definite evidence for large ewp amplitudes , but they can be easily accomodated , as is evident from our figures .",
    "all the penguins are expected to be enhanced by about a factor of 5 when going from @xmath0 to @xmath3 .",
    "this trend can be accomodated easily for the color - allowed ewps , but appears to be very hard for the color - suppressed ones . thus , even if the color - allowed ewps can be explained within the present models , the color - suppressed one poses a serious challenge .",
    "is the situation so bizarre because we do not understand the dynamics of penguins , or to be more general , that of low - energy qcd ?",
    "no one knows , but from intuitive arguments it is very hard to establish such a large ewp amplitude compared to the strong penguins .",
    "one should not also forget the possibility that the experimental data may change over the years , though such an assumption does not help the analysis .",
    "is the solution to be found in physics beyond the sm ?",
    "again , it is early days , but one may be hopeful , more so because this may provide an indirect evidence for such np before the large hadron collider ( lhc ) comes into operation .",
    "np models generate new operators in the effective hamiltonian , or modify the wilson coefficients for the existing operators ( an example is the universal extra dimension model of appelquist _ et al _ @xcite ) . if the interactions are flavor - specific , they will appear as a modification to the tree or the ewp amplitudes .",
    "these models include exotic quarks , new @xmath25 gauge bosons , r - parity conserving and violating supersymmetry and so on .    a couple of cautions here .",
    "first , one needs the exact structure of a model to be more specific than the present analysis .",
    "what one can do is to eliminate models : for example , supersymmetry with flavor alignment will not generate such a large fcnc amplitude .",
    "the exact weightage of new operators will also depend on the particular model chosen .",
    "second , this analysis has to be slightly modified if there is new physics in @xmath27 mixing .",
    "this has been discussed in section 3 .",
    "where should one get confirmatory signals for such np effects ? again , that depends on the specific model .",
    "we have already mentioned @xmath136 ; another place would be the semileptonic @xmath139 decays . for nonleptonic decays",
    ", one should carefully analyse the @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 channels .",
    "an analysis of angular correlations in @xmath141 @xcite should be useful .",
