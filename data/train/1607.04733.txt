    "the actuation concept consists of two elements .",
    "first , the conversion of rotation into time - reversible translation is achieved by each particle separately , hence , a single - particle problem .",
    "second , the breaking of the time reversibility arises from the interaction between the particles in a cluster . in the following ,",
    "these two elements are demonstrated qualitatively by a combination of analytic and numerical calculations with sd - particles .",
    "afterwards , the investigations are used to explain our experimental observations of actuated clusters from spheres with a hemispherical magnetic coating , which move under oscillating fields .",
    "we access the role of magnetic asymmetry of a single dipolar particle by considering its reciprocal motion under oscillating fields for four different scenarios ( fig .",

    "asymmetry is introduced by sd - particles , where the magnetic center is shifted away from the geometric center ( case ii , fig .",

    "the rotation around the magnetic center displaces the particle center periodically . in an isotropic environment ,",
    "the particle center moves on an arc @xcite with a radius determined by the shift @xmath8 .",
    "the behavior changes in the proximity of a wall , where anisotropic drag is present .",
    "we consider this case here because the experiments described later in this work are performed on particles moving close to a planar substrate .",
    "we emphasize that the presence of a wall is , however , not essential for the actuation mechanism presented here .",
    "already for a sphere with central dipole ( case iii , fig .",
    "[ pics : sk - trans - sd ] ) in a liquid medium close to a wall , rotation is converted into reversible back and forth displacement .",
    "an sd - particle also rolls back and forth , and additionally performs a periodic displacement away from the wall and towards the wall ( case iv , fig .",
    "[ pics : sk - trans - sd ] ) because the magnetic center is shifted away from the geometric center of the sphere .",
    "in contrast to case iii , this motion is not symmetric with respect to @xmath0 due to the hindrance by the wall .    .",
    "the scenarios depict a sphere with central dipole ( i , iii ) and shifted dipole ( ii , iv ) in an isotropic medium ( i , ii ) and close to a wall ( iii , iv ) . the dipole ( light red arrow ) with moment @xmath9 oscillates up ( green ) and down ( yellow ) , which results in a displacement of the sphere ( dotted green and yellow circles ) under asymmetric conditions ( ii - iv ) .",
    ", width=328 ]    for an sd - particle in an isotropic medium , we can derive an analytic expression for the displacement of the particle center that arises from the rotation by an infinitesimal angle @xmath10 around the magnetic center ( see appendix ) .",

    "since the rotation around the shifted magnetic center periodically changes the distance between particle center and wall , also the hydrodynamic friction coefficient changes periodically . to illustrate the concept , here",

    "the directions of the two translations are opposite to each other as can be seen by the comparison between cases ii and iii .",
    "therefore , for oscillations close to a wall ( iv ) the displacement during @xmath19 is always higher than during @xmath20 and , thus , @xmath21 .",
    "if the influence of the surface on the displacement is stronger than that of the shifted magnetic center , then during @xmath22 the overall translation direction is even inverted with respect to the one in an isotropic medium ( ii ) , and @xmath23 .",
    "otherwise @xmath24 holds .",
    "note that the integral of eq .",
    "[ eq : conv - med ] over one oscillation cycle ( @xmath25 ) becomes zero due to the time reversibility .",
    "next , we transfer the considerations for a single sd - particle to sd - particles that form a two - dimensional cluster in the plane @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that within the cluster the particles are free to rotate in response to magnetic stimuli but that the relative distances between all particles are kept constant during field exposure .",
    "the simplest case to study interacting sd - particles is given if they form a ring .",
    "then , ideally all particles have identical boundary conditions and behave uniformly .",
    "as an example , a ring of three particles ( triple ring , fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]a ) will be studied .        in analogy to a single sd - particle , rotation by @xmath27",
    "displaces each sd - particle by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , since the particles are constrained to a circle ( fig .  [ graph : sk - rot]a ) and move uniformly , the displacement @xmath28 is forced along an orbit spanned by the particle centers . as a consequence , the displacement of each sd - particle , induced by the rotation @xmath27 ,",
    "is hindered sterically by the presence of neighboring particles .",
    "the hindrance depends on the angle @xmath30 that is enclosed by the tangent to that orbit and the in - plane component of the dipole ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]a ) .",
    "@xmath11 becomes zero if @xmath31 , and it is completely unobstructed if @xmath32 . such an anisotropic hindrance is taken into account by introducing the reduction factor @xmath33 .",
    "this hindrance indirectly affects also the displacement @xmath12 .",
    "the factor @xmath34 suggests that the hindrance between interacting particles depends exclusively on @xmath30 . to determine @xmath30 during the driven oscillations of sd - particles in a triple ring ,",
    "we have studied the rotational ( angular ) motion of the particles separately from their translational motion .",
    "the rotational motion @xmath35 has been obtained by numerically solving the equation of rotation of the interacting sd - particles under an oscillating field @xmath13 , which points perpendicular to the plane of the ring cluster .",
    "the periodic variation of @xmath36 leads to an oscillatory behaviour of @xmath37 .",
    "additionally , we have observed that the variation of @xmath0 involves a periodic change of @xmath30 for interacting sd - particles in a ring .",
    "the trajectories of the dipoles in @xmath0-@xmath30 coordinates are double loops ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]b ) .",
    "starting from the field - free equilibrium state ( 0 ) , the dipoles perform a short transient oscillation until they reach a steady - state oscillation along the path i@xmath38iv .",
    "the loop implies that the dipoles obtain larger angles @xmath30 while @xmath39 increases ( i / iii ) than during the part of the trajectory in which @xmath39 decreases ( ii / iv ) ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]c ) .",
    "such a loop trajectory @xmath40 breaks time reversibility since the sense of direction of the loop is uniquely defined .",
    "inserting @xmath40 into the reduction term @xmath41 gives rise to a time - irreversible translation of the sd - particles along the orbit .",
    "during increase of @xmath39 , the displacement @xmath11 is hindered more strongly than during decrease of @xmath39 .",
    "based on that a non - reciprocal displacement @xmath11 of the sd - particles in the triple ring can be predicted , which leads to an effective rotation of the whole ring ( fig .",

    "the time dependence of the displacement @xmath43 can be obtained by inserting analytic expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath44 .",
    "fitting the numerical data ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]b ) to lissajous curves ( see appendix ) yields suitable approximate functional terms .",
    "the net translation is obtained by integration , @xmath45 ( fig .  [ graph : sk - rot]d ) .",
    "for a ring in an isotropic medium , the sd - particles periodically translate back and forth twice per movement cycle ( fig .  [",
    "graph : sk - rot]d ) similar to a single particle ( case ii , fig .",
    "[ pics : sk - trans - sd ] ) .",
    "in addition , they gain an overall distance @xmath46 traveled after each movement cycle i@xmath38iv .",
    "this is a very small effect since @xmath1 is in the range of a few @xmath47 , and @xmath46 is less than one tenth of that range .",
    "the translation @xmath48 during one cycle can be detailed as follows . during increase of @xmath39 ( i / iii ) ,",
    "the particle translates with its magnetic side ahead ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]c ) , defined as back motion .",
    "forth translation with the non - magnetic side ahead occurs during sections ii and iv . as derived from the rotational trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]b ) , the factor @xmath49 during i / iii is smaller than during ii / iv .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 .",
    "the integration of @xmath11 over one field cycle is , thus , positive .",
    "the particles in a ring perform a net translation along the orbit with the non - magnetic side facing forward .",
    "finally , the uniform translation of all particles along the orbit gives an effective rotation of the whole ring in the plane of the particle centers .",
    "in addition to the translation @xmath11 in the plane of the triple ring , also the motion @xmath12 perpendicular to the ring has to be considered . collectively , the particles move up and down , resulting in an oscillating up - and - down translation of the ring . due to the broken symmetry caused by @xmath49 ,",
    "the trajectory in @xmath17-direction is not reversible either .",
    "however , the vertical component @xmath17 that is gained during @xmath51 is reversed during @xmath52 , and the ring gains no overall distance along @xmath17 .    for a ring that is located on a surface ,",
    "the translation @xmath48 has been obtained analogously ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]d ) . in this case , the factor @xmath53 has been applied in eq .",
    "[ eq : conv - med]a .",
    "the translational behavior differs qualitatively from the one in an isotropic medium if a value @xmath23 is applied , i.e. if the surface drag dominates over the effect of the dipole shift on the translation .",
    "then , negative values of @xmath54 reverse the sign of the displacements in sections iii and iv . thus , forth displacement takes place during ii / iii and back displacement occurs during i / iv ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]d ) . during i / ii , where @xmath55 is effective",
    ", the translation @xmath48 looks similar to the one without surface .",
    "further , since on the surface @xmath21 , @xmath56 holds .",
    "also in this scenario the integrated forth displacement @xmath1 ( facing the non - magnetic side ) is larger than the back displacement ( magnetic side ) during one field cycle . in the example presented in fig .  [",
    "graph : sk - rot]d , the ratio @xmath57 has been applied .",
    "this ratio is also visible in the curve @xmath48 by the ratio between the amplitude during i / ii and the one during iii / iv .",
    "the proposed concept of actuation is , of course , not limited to the triple cluster , which is , however , the smallest entity showing this effect .",
    "the concept can be applied to other clusters , too , as will be shown next by experimental studies .",
    "the proposed actuation of interacting sd - particles under oscillating fields can indeed be found in an experimental system .",
    "we use particles with a hemispherical magnetic coating , so - called capped or janus particles . due to the hemispherical coating ,",
    "the magnetic center of mass is shifted away from the particle center .",
    "using a ferromagnetic coating with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy gives a dipole moment that points radially outwards @xcite .",
    "for such a particle , the orientation of the dipole coincides with the janus director , which is visualized by transmission light microscopy via the optical contrast between the transparent , uncoated and the intransparent , coated hemisphere .",
    "after sedimentation on a substrate , these particles assemble in a great variety of open and compact two - dimensional structures with diverse magnetic order @xcite . in the following the behavior of selected structures under oscillating fields",

    "( scale bars : 5@xmath63 m ) ]    spontaneously , the capped particles self - assemble into triple rings ( r3 ) .",
    "if such a ring is exposed to oscillating fields @xmath64 , one can indeed observe that it rotates ( fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]a ) .",
    "the uncapped , non - magnetic hemisphere always faces towards the direction of net rotation of the ring , as expected from the simulations presented above .",
    "the translations @xmath48 of the particles with diameter @xmath65 m have been accessed quantitatively by image analysis . in fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]b , @xmath48 is plotted over three movement cycles with four data points each .",
    "the net translation can be concluded from the averaged slope of the curve .",
    "the relative increase @xmath66 per cycle for the capped particles is in the range of a few @xmath67 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath66 in comparison with that obtained for sd - particles ( fig .",
    "[ graph : sk - rot]b ) results from the broad magnetization distribution of the capped particles , which leads to a slight modification of the interaction potential that is assumed between particles with one shifted point dipole each @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the curve in fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]b looks similar to the one proposed for particles in a ring on the substrate ( fig .  [",
    "graph : sk - rot]d ) . both exhibit a motion sequence of fast forth , slow forth , slow back , and fast back translation , where the speed corresponds to the local slope of the curve @xmath48 . in analogy to the simulation",
    ", the ratio between the amplitudes during the section of slow and fast translation gives a measure for the ratio between the conversion factors @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the amplitudes in the experimental curve ( fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]b ) suggest that @xmath70 .",
    "we propose that only the distance between particles and substrate determines @xmath71 .",
    "the actuation of particles with various surface coatings on the magnetic hemisphere has shown that the two chemically different surfaces of the particles have no influence on the propulsion efficiency .",
    "next , we have tested whether the actuation concept also holds for other clusters .",
    "capped particles ( and also sd - particles ) do not form larger rings spontaneously due to the magnetic asymmetry .",
    "however , we have shown earlier that closed rings and linear chains ( r5 and c5 in fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]c ) can form if weak , low - frequency oscillating fields are applied @xcite .",
    "the presence of these clusters is , thus , linked directly to any motion of these clusters under oscillating fields .",
    "we have observed that r5 rotates in the image plane , leading to a significant slope in @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]d ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the above discussion .",
    "in contrast , under the same environmental conditions , chains ( c5 ) only perform periodic back and forth displacement along the chain direction with almost no net translation .",
    "we have found previously that the loop trajectory , which breaks time - reversal symmetry , only exists for non - collinear dipolar particles with non - zero shift @xcite .",
    "simulations of sd - particles in a linear chain have shown that under oscillating fields their dipoles obtain a head - to - tail orientation where they perform only reciprocal oscillations @xmath44 without variation in @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that collinear sd - particles under oscillating fields do not exhibit loop - trajectories , and , thus , they can not translate .",
    "the small , but yet visible , slope in the trajectory of c5 ( fig .",
    "[ graph:3 - 4ring]d ) implies that the particles in c5 are not perfectly collinear at all times , resulting in a weak translation along the chain direction .",
    "this might be caused by thermally induced bending ( deformation ) of the chain .",
    "mt , @xmath72hz ( _ a _ : 88s ; _ b _ : 251s ) and ( _ c _ ) under an oscillating field ( @xmath73mt , @xmath74hz ) and a constant in - plane field ( @xmath75mt ) .",
    "the orientation of @xmath76 is switched from the @xmath77-axis to the @xmath78-axis during the recording , leading to a change of the translation direction .",
    "( scale bars : 5@xmath63 m ) ]    so far , the actuation of interacting sd - particles has been demonstrated for ring clusters to take advantage of symmetric boundary conditions .",
    "of course , the presented concept also holds if the assembled cluster is not rotationally symmetric .",
    "since the motion of a cluster arises from the sum of the displacements @xmath11 of the constituting particles , the lack of rotational symmetry can result in more diverse motion . as an example , two compact clusters consisting of five particles ( fig .",
    "[ graph : rot - trans]a , b ) have been actuated by oscillating fields .",
    "these stable clusters , which have formed by self - assembly , exhibit the same spatial shape but slightly different magnetic configurations .",
    "specifically , they differ in the azimuthal orientation of only one particle ( most left one in the insets in fig .  [",
    "graph : rot - trans ] ) while all other four particles are similar .",
    "interestingly , this small difference in the magnetic configuration leads to a drastic difference in the trajectory of the clusters when actuated by oscillating fields ( fig .",
    "[ graph : rot - trans]a , b ) .",
    "one of the clusters ( a ) performs a screw - like motion while the other ( b ) exhibits an almost linear path .",
    "this can be understood when considering that each particle in a cluster contributes to the overall translation with a component @xmath11 that points along its dipole moment , i.e. the in - plane cap orientation . in cluster ( a )",
    "the dipole vectors of the particles form a bent ring , which leads to the observed helical motion . in cluster ( b )",
    ", the vectorial sum of the cap orientations gives a significant net magnetic moment , leading to directed translation of the cluster .",
    "the net moment additionally can be used to orient the cluster in weak fields parallel to the cluster plane .",
    "this enables a control over the translation direction ( fig .",
    "[ graph : rot - trans]c ) .",
    "after orienting the cluster along a parallel field , it performs directed translation under an additional oscillating field . switching the in - plane field orientation by @xmath79 results in a change of the translation direction . a noteworthy feature in the example presented in fig .",
    "[ graph : rot - trans]c is that the translation path is not parallel to the direction of the applied field , because the net magnetic orientation of this cluster does not coincide with its effective translation direction .",
    "in a highly viscous environment , microscopic objects can be actuated by an oscillating field only if they exhibit two addressable coordinates of motion .",
    "this is necessary in order to break time - reversal symmetry in the absence of inertia . here",
    ", we have proposed that actuation of structurally non - deforming microscopic objects under oscillating fields is possible under certain conditions without the need for anisotropic drag .",
    "the concept requires a multi - component object ( cluster ) , where the interaction between the oscillating components activates a coordinate of motion that is different from the coordinate along which the oscillating field acts . in the example presented here , the components are magnetic spheres .",
    "they can rotate in response to the external field , and , additionally , in response the interaction with their magnetic neighbors .",
    "time - reversal symmetry under oscillating fields is broken if the particles exhibit an anisotropic magnetization distribution and if they do not form a dipolar head - to - tail chain .",
    "then , the interparticle interaction causes a torsional oscillation perpendicular to the field direction , leading to non - reciprocal motion .",
    "this actuation concept does not require an anisotropic environment .",
    "as explained here for a ring cluster , the presence of anisotropic drag close to a surface only modifies the motion .",
    "we propose that this actuation concept can be generalized to other objects that consist of particles with anisotropic interaction comparable to that caused by the magnetic shift @xcite .",
    "the benefit of this approach lies in the variability of the following three features .",
    "first and most striking , the overall translation pattern can take different paths depending on the respective magnetic configuration of a cluster .",
    "second , the translation direction can be controlled .",
    "third , from the equation of motion ( eq .  [ eq : erot - coup ] ) it can be deduced that the speed of motion is adjustable by varying the amplitude of the oscillating field .",
    "the path of a cluster arises from the sum of the contributions of each constituting particle .",
    "ring clusters perform rotation under oscillating fields due to their rotational symmetry . other , asymmetric clusters perform directed translation as demonstrated by magnetically capped particles .",
    "the motion crucially depends on the position and orientation of each constituting particle .",
    "the modification of only one particle orientation drastically influences the translation path .",
    "this suggests that by proper assembly of a cluster two - dimensional rotation and translation as well as any combination of both can be realized . to predict the translation path of a cluster other than a ring cluster",
    "full numerical simulations are required . for those ,",
    "the shape asymmetry of a cluster additionally requires to include hydrodynamic drag @xcite , providing a complex problem on its own .",
    "since a translating cluster exhibits a residual magnetic moment , the orientation of the whole cluster can be controlled by a weak , constant field .",
    "a superimposed oscillating field then leads to orientation - controlled directed translation .",
    "thus , the actuation with a single field component advantageously gives two remaining field components free for controlling the translation direction .    from the presented concept",
    ", we derive that the field amplitude directly controls the actuation speed .",
    "the field amplitude is directly proportional to the angular velocity of the particles , which controls the size of the oscillation amplitude @xmath80 as the integration bounds of eq .",
    "[ eq : conv - med ] .",
    "therefore , the field amplitude determines the displacement @xmath46 per movement cycle .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presented results show that anisotropic interactions between the rotatable components of an object enable actuation in highly viscous media .",
    "this provides a promising alternative to anisotropic drag as the commonly used actuation principle .",
    "based on the simplicity of the applied field pattern that drives the motion , the question remains whether similar motion patterns can be found in animate systems .",
    "in addition to anisotropic interaction potentials , also entropic interactions between ( plentiful available ) components with anisotropic shape @xcite might provide comparable propulsion mechanisms based on the idea of non - reciprocal oscillation .",

    "<S> we present a concept for the actuation of structurally non - deforming objects under oscillating fields in a highly viscous environment , a process which so far is considered impossible . </S>",
    "<S> the objects are self - assembled clusters of colloidal particles that are held together solely by magnetic forces . based on analytic and numerical studies , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an oscillating field , which induces only reciprocal motion on a single , rigid particle , can propel such clusters if the composing particles exhibit an off - centered dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected observation can be understood when taking into account that the magnetic interaction between such particles in the cluster breaks time - reversal symmetry under oscillating fields . </S>",
    "<S> we approve this theoretical prediction with an experimental system of magnetic janus particles , and show that the magnetic configuration of a cluster of such janus particles determines its motion path . </S>",
    "<S> it can range from rotation to helical motion and directed translation , where the orientation of the latter can be controlled by an additional constant , weak magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the presented concept establishes a counterpart to the actuation of deforming objects , such as artificial flagella , in oscillating fields , and to motion in rotating fields .    </S>",
    "<S> since purcell proposed the scallop theorem in 1977 @xcite , locomotion of microscopic objects has been the subject of intense research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fascination for migration at this length scale arises from the time reversibility of motion patterns in highly viscous environments , where inertia can be neglected . in many everyday cases such as swimming </S>",
    "<S> , locomotion is generated by a cyclic process ; in such cases this time reversibility limits the possibility of migration . under any oscillating pattern of motion , a rigid microscopic object repeatedly goes back and forth by the same distance . </S>",
    "<S> such a so - called reciprocal motion excludes directed migration . yet , nature has found ways for microorganisms to move @xcite . typically , these organisms exploit anisotropic drag to break time reversibility . beyond that </S>",
    "<S> , artificial propulsion methods have been established based on controlled shape changes or changes in the chemical environment of the objects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to improve the control over translation patterns and to increase the choice of materials / environments for advanced applications in non - invasive medicine and lab - on - chip systems .    </S>",
    "<S> torque - based magnetic actuation , i.e. propulsion of magnetic micro - objects via their alignment in time - dependent fields , is particularly advantageous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be controlled remotely , only homogeneous fields are required , and it is widely independent from the chemical environment and the optical properties of the system . since a torque causes a magnetic moment to solely rotate by an angle @xmath0 , translation @xmath1 can be induced only if the rotation creates a force on the center of mass of the object .        to date , most examples of magnetic actuation exploit hydrodynamic coupling between rotation and translation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , coupling appears if the object has a helical shape ( propelling ) @xcite , or if the environment is anisotropic , e.g. , close to a no - slip surface ( rolling ) @xcite ( fig.[sktrans]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , under any cyclic , torque - based actuation this coupling leads to an effective displacement only if the start- and the endpoint of each cycle differ . </S>",
    "<S> due to time reversibility , this can be realized only if at least two coordinates of motion of the object are affected in a time - dependent manner . </S>",
    "<S> trivially , this is the case under rotating or precessing fields , which act along two coordinates ( fig.[sktrans]c ) , and lead to rolling or propelling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , an oscillating field exerts a time - dependent torque along one coordinate only , leading to reversibly back and forth motion of a rigid object between maximum deflection angles @xmath2 . in terms of applications , oscillating fields are , however , advantageous over rotating fields since technically they are much easier to generate and to exert on a sample . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is , thus , to activate motion along an additional coordinate that breaks time reversibility . </S>",
    "<S> so far , this has been realized only by incorporating structural flexibility . </S>",
    "<S> reported systems comprise objects with flexible tails ( fig.[sktrans]b ) , resembling flagella @xcite . during the field oscillation </S>",
    "<S> they perform asymmetric undulations , and the hydrodynamic coupling leads to propulsion . </S>",
    "<S> also , rigid objects can be actuated in the proximity of an elastic ( flexible ) surface @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we present an alternative actuation concept that enables the propulsion of structurally non - deforming objects with oscillating fields . </S>",
    "<S> the studied objects are self - assembled clusters of a few spheres that exhibit an off - centered net magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> the additional mobility is given by the fact that the individual spheres are able to rotate inside the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the relative distances between all spheres within a cluster remain constant , hence these are non - deforming clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the concept qualitatively with a simple theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> it assumes spheres with an embedded dipole that is not centered but shifted radially outwards , so - called shifted - dipole particles ( sd - particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the spheres with this magnetic asymmetry breaks time - reversal symmetry under oscillating fields , causing motion even without the need for hydrodynamic drag . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions can be verified with an experimental system of magnetic janus spheres . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we obtain a variety of motion paths , which depend on the cluster configuration . </S>"
