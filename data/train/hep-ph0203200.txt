    "rare processes involving various particles have always been a gold mine for extracting interesting physics @xcite . for example",
    ", the smallness of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in the @xmath8 system prompted the introduction of the gim mechanism and subsequently to the prediction @xmath9 gev and the discovery of @xmath10 and @xmath11 s .",
    "@xmath12 mixing was a precursor to a heavy top quark , as confirmed by experiment .",
    "fcnc rare top decays , for which there are only weak upper bounds , will hopefully be discovered in future experiments , thus serving as direct indications for deviations from the standard model ( sm ) , since the latter leads to branching ratios which are smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "the situation in rare @xmath6 decays , which is the subject of this paper , bears some similarities to rare @xmath14 decays . in both cases",
    "the sm results from the loop induced fcnc decays are very small , beyond reach , at least for @xmath14 , in the foreseeable future .",
    "therefore , any significant detection of a rare decay at the level higher than @xmath13 or @xmath15 for @xmath14 or @xmath6 , respectively , would serve as an indisputable proof for physics beyond the the sm .",
    "if new physics is `` around the corner '' , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath16 tev , the @xmath6 boson and the top being so close to that scale , are expected to be the particles most affected by new physics .    in this paper",
    "we study the rare decays @xmath17 , where @xmath18 indicate the generation index of a charge @xmath19 quark , in various models . in the sm",
    "it was found that @xcite @xmath20 ; we do not repeat the sm calculation here .",
    "three of the models we discuss , have already been considered in connection with @xmath21 , namely the 2 higgs doublets model type ii ( 2hdmii ) @xcite , supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite and susy with r - parity violation ( rpv ) @xcite .",
    "therefore we comment , wherever it is relevant in the coming sections , about differences and similarities with previous works .",
    "note that in addition one can find in the literature discussion of fcnc hadronic @xmath6 decays , in models not covered by us in the present article @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the attention devoted to fcnc in @xmath6 decays at lep and sld has been close to nil .",
    "the best upper limit is @xcite    @xmath22    this preliminary result is based on about @xmath23 hadronic decays , and we used @xcite @xmath24 .",
    "we urge our experimental colleagues to sift through their lep data to improve the current , rather loose , limit .    in the future , there will be at least two venues in which @xmath6 bosons will be produced in much larger quantities than their number in lep . in a high luminosity lhc with an integrated luminosity of @xmath25 ,",
    "one expects @xmath26 z bosons to be produced @xcite . a cleaner environment for the processes at hand ,",
    "will be provided by a future @xmath27 linear collider . in particular",
    ", there is a viable possibility to lower the tesla center of mass energy down to @xmath28 , the so called `` giga - z '' option . with integrated luminosity of @xmath29 ,",
    "it is possible to produce more than @xmath30 @xmath6 bosons @xcite , about 2 orders of magnitudes larger than in lep . to grasp the improvement in going from lep to giga - z option of tesla",
    ", we note that while the sensitivity of lep to @xmath31 was @xmath32 @xcite , it is expected to be @xmath33 in giga - z tesla @xcite .    beyond lhc and the @xmath27 linear collider ,",
    "there is also considerable interest in the community for a high energy muon collider @xcite .",
    "if this ever becomes a reality , it would also afford another very good opportunity for studying rare flavor changing decays and interactions @xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present a generic calculation of the @xmath34 vertex at the one loop level .",
    "this result will assist us to evaluate the branching ratio for the fcnc @xmath6 decays in any particular model . in section 3 , the results of two variants of the two higgs doublets model ( 2hdm ) , namely the so called type ii 2hdm ( 2hdmii ) and the top - higgs two doublets model ( t2hdm ) , will be reported . in 2hdmii , t2hdm we get the disappointing results @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we then move on to section 4 , where our results in supersymmetry ( susy ) with squark mixing , are displayed .",
    "again , two options are presented , the first one with @xmath36 mixing and the second one with @xmath37 mixing . in the first case",
    "the branching ratio can reach a respectable @xmath38 while the second case yields a branching ratio of @xmath39 . in section 5",
    "we turn to susy with r - parity violation ( rpv ) , where the effects of @xmath40 trilinear coupling terms in the rpv superpotential and of @xmath41 terms ( @xmath41 is the coefficient of the soft breaking rpv bilinear term ) , are considered .",
    "two categories of rpv are considered : those which lead to a branching ratio @xmath42 and those with a branching ratio @xmath43 .",
    "for the first category we get typically branching ratios at the level of @xmath13 , while for the second type of rpv , we find an encouraging possibility of @xmath38 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we outline the generic framework for calculating the radiative one - loop flavor changing interaction vertex @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 or @xmath47 . we define the one - loop amplitude for @xmath48 in terms of form factors which are calculated for the complete set of one - loop diagrams that can potentially contribute to @xmath48 in the presence of flavor violating interactions between neutral scalars and fermions as well as non - diagonal vertices of charged scalars with fermions of different generations .",

    "we will focus on two specific versions of a 2hdm :    * * 2hdm of type ii ( 2hdmii ) * + the 2hdmii follows from the choice @xmath134 and @xmath135 in which case only @xmath136 generates the masses of the up - type quarks and only @xmath137 is responsible for the mass generation of the down - type quarks @xcite .",

    "* 2hdm `` for the top - quark '' ( t2hdm ) * + in the t2hdm @xcite , the large mass of the top - quark is accommodated in a natural fashion by coupling the second higgs doublet ( @xmath136 ) , which has a much larger vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , only to the top - quark ; all other quarks are coupled to the 1st higgs doublet ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this scenario is , therefore , realized by setting in ( [ yukawa ] ) : + @xmath138 + where @xmath139 is again an unknown yukawa @xmath133 matrix in quark flavor space .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     to summarize this section , with a large @xmath5 , a @xmath141 is possible within the type b scenario , e.g. , for @xmath142 lepton number violation in the susy scalar potential ( @xmath143 ) and if the sleptons masses lie around @xmath144 gev . for a heavier slepton spectrum a larger @xmath145",
    "is required in order to push the branching ratio to the @xmath4 level .",
    "it should also be emphasized that since @xmath146 is dominated by the @xmath147 , the decay @xmath3 is an efficient probe of this specific flavor changing trilinear rpv coupling .",
    "in this section we will very briefly comment about the feasibility of observing ( or achieving a limit ) a signal of @xmath3 with a branching ratio of order @xmath4 , at a linear collider producing @xmath30 z - bosons .",
    "such a signal should appear in the detector as an event with one b - jet and one light - jet ( assuming no distinction is made between @xmath148 or @xmath149-quarks ) . in the spirit of the analysis made with the 1993 and 1994 lep data on @xmath3 @xcite",
    ", one defines @xmath150 and @xmath151 to be the efficiencies that a quark ( or anti - quark ) of flavor @xmath81 is tagged as a @xmath41-jet ( @xmath152 ) and light - jet ( @xmath153 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the key efficiency parameters for the detection of @xmath3 are @xmath154 and @xmath155 , where the latter represent the probability that a @xmath41-jet is identified as a light - jet and is important for controlling the dominant background ( to the @xmath156 signal ) coming from @xmath157 .",
    "note , that due to the expected smallness of the `` purity '' parameters @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( see @xcite ) , the background to @xmath156 caused by the sm @xmath160 decays will be sub - dominant .    with @xmath30",
    "z - bosons , the expected number of events coming from @xmath3 ( i.e. , from new physics ) and identified as @xmath156 , is :    @xmath161    similarly , the expected number of background @xmath156 events coming from the sm decay @xmath157 is :    @xmath162    using ( [ ns ] ) and ( [ nb ] ) , the expected statistical significance , @xmath163 , of the new physics signal @xmath3 , with a branching ratio of order @xmath4 , can reach beyond the 3-sigma level for @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "these values require an improvement to the 1993 and 1994 analysis @xcite , by a factor of 2 - 3 for @xmath167 and @xmath168 and by an order of magnitude for @xmath155 . with the expected advancement in the jet - tagging methods , in particular , for two - body decays of the z - boson",
    ", these required values for the efficiency parameters above should be well within the reach of the future linear collider .",
    "we can also get a clue about how low one can go in the value ( or limit ) of @xmath169 with @xmath30 z - bosons , from the fact that the lep preliminary results @xcite achieved @xmath170 with @xmath171 z - bosons . scaling this limit , especially with the expected advance in b - tagging and identification of non - b jets methods ,",
    "an @xmath172 branching ratios should be easily attained at a giga - z factory .",
    "we have re - examined the flavor changing radiative decays of a @xmath6-boson to a pair of down - quarks , @xmath0 , with @xmath173 .",
    "these z - decay channels may prove useful in searching for new flavor physics beyond the sm at the tesla collider , or any other future collider , which may be designed to run on the z - pole with high luminosities , thus accumulating more than @xmath30 on - shell z - bosons . with advances in technology ,",
    "e.g. , improved b - tagging efficiencies , the flavor changing decay @xmath3 - most likely the easiest to detect among the flavor changing hadronic z - decays - may be accessible to a giga - z option even for branching ratios as small as @xmath174 .    the @xmath175 transition was assumed to be generated at one - loop through flavor violation in interactions between scalars and fermions .",
    "a complete analytical derivation of the width @xmath140 is presented using the form factor approach for the @xmath176 interaction vertex .",
    "these form factors are evaluated for the complete set of scalar - fermion one - loop exchanges with generic scalar - fermion flavor - violating couplings .",
    "this prescription is then applied to the decay @xmath3 in six beyond the sm model scenarios for flavor - violation in the scalar sector :    1 .",
    "two higgs doublet models with non - standard charged - higgs couplings to quarks : * a two higgs doublet model of type ii ( 2hdmii ) . * a two higgs doublet model `` for the top - quark '' ( t2hdm ) .",
    "2 .   supersymmetry with flavor - violation in the squark sector : * supersymmetry with stop - scharm mixing . * supersymmetry with sbottom - sstrange mixing .",
    "3 .   supersymmetry with flavor - violation from r - parity violating interactions : * supersymmetry with trilinear r - parity violation . *",
    "supersymmetry with trilinear and bilinear r - parity violation .",
    "folding in the existing experimental limits on the relevant parameter space of each of these models , we calculated the branching ratio for the decay @xmath3 .",
    "the highlights of our results are summarized in table [ sumtab ] . in particular , we find that two higgs doublet models with flavor violation originating from charged scalar interactions with fermions are expected to yield an extremely small @xmath177 ; smaller than the sm prediction and smaller than the reach of a giga - z @xmath178 collider .",
    "thus , a signal of @xmath3 in tesla will be inconsistent with the underlying mechanisms for flavor violation in these two higgs doublets model and will , therefore , rule out these options .",
    "the same conclusions can be drawn in the stop - scharm mixing and the trilinear r - parity violation susy scenarios .",
    "on the other hand , susy with mixings between the bottom and strange - type squarks and/or mixings between sleptons and higgs fields ( bilinear r - parity violation ) both of which may originate from the soft susy breaking sector , can drive the @xmath177 to the @xmath4 level for large @xmath5 values .",
    "this enhancement is typical to these two flavor - violating susy scenarios if there are large mass - splittings between the scalars exchanged in the loops due to a gim - like cancellation which is operational in the scalar mass - matrices and is , therefore , less effective as the scalar masses depart from degeneracy .    a @xmath3 signal in a giga - z tesla or any other collider may , therefore , be a good indication for the underlying dynamics of these two flavor - violating susy scenarios and , if interpreted in that way , will provide for evidence of an hierarchical structure in the mass spectrum of the susy scalar sector .",

    "<S> we find that , within the susy scenarios for flavor violation , the branching ratio for the decay @xmath3 can reach @xmath4 for large @xmath5 values , while the typical size for this branching ratio in the 2hdm s considered is about two orders of magnitudes smaller at best . thus , flavor changing susy signatures in radiative @xmath6 decays such as @xmath7 may be accessible to future `` z factories '' such as a giga - z version of the tesla design . </S>"
