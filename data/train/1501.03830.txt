    "the absorption of a photon by a molecular system or solid can promote an electron in an occupied single - particle state ( or orbital ) to an unoccupied state while keeping the charge neutrality . in the physics community , this process is often described as the simultaneous creation of a negatively charged quasielectron ( or simply electron ) and a positively charged quasihole ( or hole ) in the material that was originally in the lowest energy electronic configuration ( the ground state ) . upon absorbing a photon ,",
    "the entire molecular or extended system is in an excited state that contains a correlated electron  hole pair , which is referred to as an _ exciton_. the amount of energy required to trigger this excitation gives an important characterization of the material . in many - body physics , a two - particle collective excitation",

    "examples of these algorithms include the hamiltonian  jacobi algorithms  @xcite and sr - like algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the bethe  salpeter hamiltonian matrix defined in   is clearly a @xmath17-symmetric matrix because @xmath36 although the algorithms for @xmath17-symmetric matrices can be used to solve the bethe ",

    ", several existing algorithms ( see  @xcite ) for solving hamiltonian eigenvalue problems can be applied to the matrix @xmath47 defined in  .",
    "the primary interest of this paper is drawn to the case when the property   holds . in this case , the bethe  salpeter eigenvalue problem is essentially a symmetric eigenvalue problem because @xmath55 is the product of two hermitian matrices , and in addition , one of them is positive definite  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 is diagonalizable and has real spectrum .",
    "in addition , the eigenvectors of @xmath8 also admit special structures .",

    "to determine the structure of the eigenvectors of @xmath8 , we start with any nonsingular matrix @xmath74 satisfying @xmath75 and @xmath76 . then @xmath77 . by setting @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we obtain that @xmath80 and @xmath81 it is straightforward to verify that the following equations are equivalent to  : @xmath82h=\\lambda_+\\bigl[x_1{^{\\mathsf h } } , -x_2{^{\\mathsf h}}\\bigr],\\\\ \\label{eq : eigvec_l- } & \\bigl[-{\\overline{x}}_2{^{\\mathsf h } } , { \\overline{x}}_1{^{\\mathsf h}}\\bigr]h = -\\lambda_+\\bigl[-{\\overline{x}}_2{^{\\mathsf h } } , { \\overline{x}}_1{^{\\mathsf h}}\\bigr ] . \\ ] ] thus we have obtained all right and left eigenvectors of @xmath8 .",

    "this suggests that the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath93 .",

    "both @xmath95 and @xmath96 are positive definite_. under this condition , the real bethe  salpeter eigenvalue problem",
    "is also known as a _ linear response eigenvalue problem _ which recently has attracted a lot of attention ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to many recent developments  @xcite in linear response eigenvalue problems that focus on large sparse eigensolvers , we develop dense eigensolvers for this eigenvalue problem in the next section .      when the off - diagonal blocks of the bethe ",

    "one can use efficient algorithms available in scalapack to compute eigenpairs of @xmath5 . in many cases ,",
    "the results are found to be sufficiently close to the eigenvalues of the full bethe  salpeter hamiltonian and explain experiment .",
    "however , in general , this simplification can lead to noticeable difference in the computed spectrum .    in this subsection , we show that tamm ",
    "dancoff approximation consistently overestimate the positive eigenvalues when the property   holds .",
