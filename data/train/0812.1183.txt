    "further support for the notion of rapid early formation of galaxies at @xmath13 , especially massive ones , comes from high @xmath14fe ratios @xcite , early metal enrichment , growth of super - massive black holes and the assembly rate of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the redshift range @xmath15 has been targeted by various surveys combining broadband color selection techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( d07 ) ) and recently by high - resolution h@xmath16 integral field spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "the origin of the high star formation rates and the large velocity dispersion in these galaxies is not presently understood .",
    "on the theoretical side , detailed comparisons between observations at @xmath2 and n - body - sph simulations or semi - analytical models ( sam ) show discrepancies .",

    "2008 ) .    theory and numerical simulations show that galaxies accrete cold gas in two modes . at early times and in small dark matter halos ,",
    "most of the gas never shock heats to the virial temperature and is accreted on a free fall time scale @xcite .",
    "the general condition for a stable extended shock to be maintained is that the post - shock gas remains highly pressurized . in practice",
    ", this means that the loss of energy by radiative cooling needs to be at least compensated by the compression of post - shock infall material @xcite .",
    "this condition leads to a critical halo mass of m@xmath21 m@xmath4 @xcite for shock heating of gas and hence a transition from fast and efficient `` cold accretion '' onto the galaxy to a more moderate `` hot accretion '' mode set by the radiative cooling time of the gas . in an earlier study @xcite showed that the number density and accretion rates of dark matter halos suffice to provide enough high star forming galaxies , assuming that the newly accreted dark matter provides the universal fraction of baryons , and that these baryons are all transformed into stars",
    "alternatively , using a hydrodynamical simulation , @xcite showed that the gas accretion rates are comparable to the observed star formation rates thus requiring a very efficient transformation of accreted gas into stars .    in this letter , we aim at addressing the interlinked questions of high star formation rates and velocity dispersion observed in galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "our work expands on the results previously presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , we model the effect of cold accretion on driving turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and employ a porosity description for the ism and star formation within it .",
    "the latter hypothesis is able to provide high star formation efficiencies in the context of a physically motivated model .",
    "in the following , we briefly outline our fiducial semi - analytic model ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and the changes we have introduced .",
    "we generate merger trees for dark matter halos using a monte - carlo approach based on the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite down to a mass resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "once a tree reaches @xmath23 , we start moving the tree forward in time including physical processes associated with the baryons within each dark matter halo that include gas cooling , star - formation , supernova feedback , reionization and merging of galaxies on a dynamical friction time - scale . in this letter",
    ", we will omit including detailed prescriptions for agn - feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or environmental effects @xcite .    in our modeling approach",
    ", we try to include the cold and hot accretion modes by first assigning the fraction @xmath24 of gas within the halo , that is in a cold accretion flow .",
    "if @xmath25 is the mass of gas within the halo , then we can readily calculate the amount of gas in the hot phase as @xmath26 .",
    "we use an approximate fit to the fraction of cold accreted material as shown in fig . 3 of @xcite and the bottom part of fig . 4 in @xcite",
    "please note that the results of @xcite indicate a mild evolution with redshift in this relation , which we for the sake of simplicity neglect in this study . throughout this work we will use @xmath27 , with a lower and upper floor of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for halos greater @xmath30 m@xmath4 and less @xmath31 m@xmath4 , respectively . in a second step ,",
    "we then calculate the cold and hot mode accretion onto the galaxy via @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "part of the underlying assumption is that cold accretion flows will reach the galaxy on a halo dynamical time @xmath34 , and that the hot accretion rate will be governed by the radiatively cooling time using recipes laid out as in e.g. @xcite .",
    "we find in general that cold accretion clearly dominates over hot accretion in agreement with results of numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion rate of gas onto the disk of the central galaxy is then approximated as @xmath35 .",
    "this choice of accretion rate is the simplest possibility and shows results in agreement with those from hydrodynamical simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "star formation is modeled following the schmidt - kennicutt - law @xmath36 @xcite with a porosity - based prescription for the multiphase structure of the ism @xcite .",
    "momentum balance yields a star formation efficiency @xmath37 km s@xmath38 @xmath39 km s@xmath38 @xmath40 m@xmath41 @xmath42 erg@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 dependence arises because of the enhancement in star formation efficiency via momentum input from supernova remnants with increasing ambient turbulent pressure .",
    "note that gas accretion also drives gas turbulence , as in our model .",
    "momentum input is only effective once the remnant expansion speed has slowed to below @xmath45 here @xmath44 is the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath46 is the imf - dependent mass in stars formed for each type ii supernovae , @xmath47 the energy released by each supernova and @xmath48 the shell velocity at which strong radiative energy losses set in .",
    "we set @xmath49 km s@xmath5 and use a chabrier imf with @xmath50 m@xmath4 throughout this paper . to calculate the gas velocity dispersion in the disk , we assume equilibrium between the rate at which energy is dissipated in the disk and energy added due to kinetic energy of infalling gas and supernovae . including the @xmath51 dependence of the star formation rate predicted by the porosity model , this leads to @xmath52 .",
    "the free parameter @xmath53 allows to adjust for our ignorance with respect to the actual fraction of the kinetic energy being used to drive turbulence and the relation between the dissipation time - scale and dynamical time of the disk .",
    "@xmath53 is set to match the observed relation between @xmath54 and @xmath0 of galaxies at @xmath55 .",
    "the constant @xmath56 km s@xmath5 is set to ensure that in the limiting case of no accretion , the local observed velocity dispersion in disks is recovered .",
    "simulations show that cold accretion comes in along filaments on almost radially orbits before hitting the galactic disk @xcite , thus being able to contribute a large fraction of the gas kinetic energy to the heating of the gaseous disk , in contrast to hot - mode accreted material that settles more gradually onto the disk .    in this study",
    ", we simulate a volume of @xmath57 mpc@xmath58 , and use the following set of cosmological parameters derived from a combination of the 5-year wmap data with type ia supernovae and measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we start by investigating the increase in gas velocity dispersion in gaseous disks due to cold accretion .",
    "1 shows the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath54 . in general",
    "only @xmath64 @xmath65 of the accretion energy is sufficient to drive turbulence that agrees with the range of observed values @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this value is in agreement with recent theoretical predictions by @xcite .",
    "cold accretion - driven turbulence in galaxies living in small dark matter halos with @xmath66 km s@xmath5 results in velocity dispersions similar to or larger than the rotational velocity , mainly because of the high accretion rates and the low gas masses in the disks to absorb the associated accretion energy .",
    "these galaxies are dynamically hot system that are pressure - supported against gravitational collapse in contrast to classical cold disks .",
    "more massive galaxies with larger @xmath54 typically live in massive halos which only have small fractions of cold accretion via filaments and massive gaseous disks that are not easily heated .",
    "the steep transition from low to high @xmath0 reflects the steep decline of cold accretion flows as a function of dark halo mass that we have adopted based on simulations .",
    "the scatter seen in the @xmath67 plot is largely due to the varying accretion histories of individual halos .",
    "the inclusion of explicit cold accretion in the sam increases the overall accretion rate onto model galaxies .",
    "this might suggest that the star formation rates will increase as well .",
    "however , using a constant star formation efficiency normalized to the locally observed value of @xmath68 the number density of star forming galaxies with @xmath69 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 falls short by almost an order of magnitude in agreement with previous reports by d07 and @xcite .",
    "fueling of the galaxies with gas is not the limiting factor for high star formation rates .",
    "rather , it is the conversion of gas into stars over a short time - scale .",
    "the porosity - based model for star formation predicts that star formation efficiency scales as @xmath70 , thus providing a natural way to increase the star formation rate with redshift in parallel with the cold gas accretion rate .    in fig .",
    "2 , we present the sfr-@xmath11 relation for central galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "the model galaxies cover most of the observed range .",
    "however , we find that the slope is slightly tilted .",
    "mostly massive model galaxies have too low star formation rates . inspection of the d07 data reveals that the statistics at the massive end is rather poor and that a possible flattening at high masses as seen in our models can not be ruled out .",
    "it is interesting to note that the modeled sfr@xmath71 relation at @xmath72 lies perfectly on the region covered by the observed galaxies .",
    "the number density of star - forming galaxies with @xmath69 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 at @xmath2 is @xmath73 mpc@xmath9 and within a factor two of the observed density of @xmath74 in d07 .",
    "again our estimates for @xmath72 are in excellent agreement with the results of d07 at @xmath2 .",
    "the number density of star - forming galaxies increases by a factor two to @xmath75 and then starts to drop again ( see fig .",
    "@xcite find in their simulation a similar increase in the number density of galaxies accreting gas with @xmath76 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 going from @xmath2 to @xmath77 .",
    "however , their overall number densities are larger by a factor @xmath78 or more .",
    "also do they not find a peak around @xmath79 as we do , but a steady decline in the number density of systems accreting with high rates .",
    "[ f2 ]    as we are not generating light cones to compare with the observations , but use redshift slices , we need to ask the question whether the ulirg sub - sample of d07 is biased toward @xmath80 within the overall sample which spans the range @xmath81 . inspecting their fig . 6 , we find that galaxies with l@xmath82 l@xmath4 span a wide range in redshift between @xmath83 and @xmath84 with brighter galaxies preferably being at @xmath80 , suggesting that we are underestimating number densities because we neglect the @xmath80 contribution . taking this into account",
    ", the difference with d07 should be even less than a factor of two .    finally , we turn to the overall mass function of galaxies at @xmath2 , shown in fig .",
    "4 . one might expect that due to the enhancement of early star formation in the revised model , basic properties like the mass function will change significantly .",
    "however , good agreement is found between the modeled mass function and those based on spitzer observations by @xcite and a recent study by @xcite .",
    "the goods - music results of are a bit lower , but agree within their error margin .",
    "we have investigated a possible scenario for the formation of galaxies at high redshifts that is driven mainly by cold accretion flows .",
    "massive galaxies at @xmath2 live in halos that are at the intersections of filaments that form the cosmic web .",
    "as shown in numerical simulations , these filaments provide a steady stream of dense cold gas that can reach the galaxy on a free - fall time scale and fuel ongoing star formation .",
    "not only do these streams provide cold gas , but they can also drive turbulence in the gaseous disk by depositing some fraction of the accretion energy into the ism . we find that between @xmath85 of this accretion energy is sufficient to increase the gas velocity dispersion to observed values . in particular we choose @xmath86 , which still leaves accretion driven turbulence dominant with respect to supernovae driven one .",
    "a natural consequence of cold accretion driving turbulence is that it becomes less important in massive halos @xmath87 @xmath88 and at low redshifts ,      where the fraction of cold mode accretion drops and @xmath0 increases .",
    "low redshift observations find velocity dispersions of 10 km s@xmath5 , much lower than those at @xmath2 .",
    "this can be understood as a natural consequence of the steady demise of cold accretion with redshift in halos that host disk galaxies today .",
    "the host halos of these galaxies live no longer at the intersection of filaments , but in the filaments itself .",
    "those galaxies living in halos above the critical dark matter mass for stable shocks @xcite will no longer accrete from cold flows , but from hot halo gas , if at all , that radiatively cools and the main driver of turbulence will be supernovae .",
    "such a picture does fit in nicely with observation of low redshift disk galaxies , which have much larger @xmath0 than their high-@xmath89 counter parts @xcite .    only increasing the amount of available fuel due to cold accretion is not enough to increase the number density of galaxies with large star formation rates .",
    "it is necessary to also increase the star formation efficiency at the same time .",
    "we      tested an analytic model for a multiphase ism that is based on a porosity prescription , that has been shown to capture some of the relevant physical mechanism related to star formation seen in high - resolution simulations @xcite .",
    "the star formation efficiency in this model is @xmath70 , resulting in an increasing efficiency that parallels the gas supply by cold accretion and allows to convert it into stars on a very short time - scale . with this model",
    "we find improved agreement with the observed number density of star - forming galaxies .",
    "however our predicted star formation rates are lower than in the observed @xmath7 sample especially for the more massive galaxies .",
    "we have two comments on this point .",
    "firstly , the data are most likely biased to high star formation rates .",
    "secondly , galaxies with high star - forming rates at high redshift commonly show weak agn activity ( see for example a recent study of a sample of @xmath90 ulirgs @xcite ) .",
    "this most likely is the tip of the agn iceberg because of possible obscured agn .",
    "agn outflows could trigger as well as play the more accepted role of quenching star formation at high redshift .",
    "it remains to be investigated how well the agreement at different redshifts is , and we plan on addressing this in a future paper .",
