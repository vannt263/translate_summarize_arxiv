    "to search the infrared behaviour we expand the propagator in the powers of the coupling constant @xmath71  and obtained the fourier transform of @xmath72  [ 2,3].in that case it is not enough to see the structure of infrared behaviour which can be compared to the well - known four dimensional qed[7].instead we make laplace transformation of @xmath73which leads the general spectral representation of the propagator in momentum space.after that we show the roles of coulomb energy and position dependent mass.the former determines the dimension of the propagator and the latter acts to change mass.let us begin to study the effect of position dependent mass(self - energy),coulomb energy in momentum space@xmath74 similar discussion was given to study the effects of self - energy and bare potential in the stabilty of massless @xmath75composite in lattice simulation[8].the position space free propagator @xmath76 is modified by these two terms which are related to dynamical mass and wave function renormalization.to see this let us think about position space propagator@xmath77 it is easy to see that the probability of particles which are separated with each other in the long distance is suppressed by the factor @xmath78and the coulomb energy modifies the short distance behaviour from the bare @xmath79  to @xmath80.the effect of coulomb energy for the infrared behaviour of the free particle with mass @xmath57  can be seen by its fourier transform[2,9 ] @xmath81 above formula shows the structure in momentum space is modified for both infrared and ultraviolet regions.usually constant @xmath82  represents the coefficent of the leading infrared divergence for fixed mass in four dimension.therefore coulomb energy in three dimension has the same effects as in four dimension but change the ultraviolet behaviour since the coupling constant @xmath71  is not renormalized.now we consider the role of @xmath83  as the dynamical mass at low momentum.first we define fourier transform of the scalar part of the propagator ; @xmath84  if we use laplace transformation @xmath85 we easily see that @xmath86  acts as mass changing operator @xmath87@xmath88 to separate the @xmath89  dependence we define @xmath90 is shown in fig.4 .",

    "this means that propagator in the high energy limit has no part which is proportional to the free one.usually mass is a parameter which appears in the lagrangean.for example chiral symmetry is defined for the bare quantity.in ref[6 ] the relation between bare mass and renormalized mass of the fermion propagator in qed is discussed based on renormalization group equation with the assumption of ultraviolet stagnant point and shown that the bare mass vanishes in the high energy limit even if we start from the finite bare mass in the theory.it suggests that symmetry properties can be discussed in terms of renormalized quantities.in qcd",
    "bare mass vanishes in the short distance by asymptotic freedom.and the dynamical mass vanishes too[5].in our apprximation this problem is understood that at short distance propagator in position space tends to @xmath97 where we have @xmath98 at @xmath99 case which is independent of the bare mass @xmath100.thus we have a same effect as vanishing bare mass in four dimensional model.of course we have a dynamical mass generation which is @xmath101 for @xmath102 in our approximation@xmath103there is a chiral symmetry at short distance where the bare or dynamical mass vanishes in momentum space but its breaking must be discussed in terms of the values of the order parameter.therefore it is interesting to study the possibility of pair condensation in our approximation.the vacuum expectation value of pair condensate is evaluated @xmath104 is finite for @xmath65 for finite cut - off @xmath105 in the weak coupling limit we obtain @xmath106 and @xmath107.if we introduce chiral symmetry as a global @xmath108,it breaks dynamically into @xmath109 as in qcd[9,11 ] for @xmath99 for finite infrared cut-off.our model may be applicable to relativistic model of super fluidity in three dimension.usually we do not find the critical coupling @xmath99 in the analysis of the dyson - schwinger equation in momentum space where only continuum contributions are taken into account and we do not define physical mass.finally we notice the effects of vacuum polarization[4,10,11,12].in the presence of vacuum polarization with @xmath110 massless fermion the mass shift and dynamical mass we find in the quenched case are decreased by screening at short distance.in the long distance mass shitft is strongly suppresd and we have only wave renormalization as in four dimension.we have an infrared behaviour of the propagator in the landau gauge @xmath111",
