    "kovtun , son , and starinets ( kss ) have proposed a conjecture that there is a universal bound for the ratio of shear viscosity , @xmath1 , to entropy density , @xmath2 , @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are plank s constant and boltzmann s constant , respectively .",
    "( for the remainder of this paper we will use units with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . )",
    "kss found that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) is saturated by certain strongly coupled field theories which have a super - gravity dual @xcite , and conjectured that @xmath0 has a universal lower limit . physically interesting and accessible fluids , such as water , liquid nitrogen , and helium-4",
    "satisfy the bound @xcite .",
    "the bound appears to be well justified for the class of field theories originally considered by kss @xcite , but it is not obvious from first principles that it should apply more universally ( hence its status as a conjecture ) .",
    "the original form of the kss conjecture states that the bound should be universal and apply to _ all _ fluids , including non - relativistic fluids @xcite .",
    "yet even such an all - encompassing statement includes ambiguities .",
    "it is not clear what one might mean by  all fluids \" in such a context .",
    "is the conjecture limited to physically realizable systems , or is it equally applicable to theoretical fluids which can be constructed in some given class of theories ?",
    "if so , in which class of theories does the bound hold ? is a  fluid \" required to be absolutely stable , or",
    "can the fluid be metastable ?",
    "are the number of species of particle that compose the fluid limited ? perhaps due to questions such as these , a number of variants of the conjecture with various proposed domains of validity were subsequently proposed by kss .",
    "these include variants which stipulate that the bound is valid for `` all relativistic quantum field theories at finite temperature and zero chemical potential '' @xcite , for at least a `` single component nonrelativistic gas of particles with either spin zero or spin 1/2 '' @xcite , or for `` all systems which can be obtained from a sensible relativistic quantum field theory by turning on temperatures and chemical potentials '' @xcite .",
    "while some of these variants appear quite similar at first glance , they actually have quite different regimes of validity .",
    "if the bound could be shown to be correct in any of its proposed forms , or indeed in some readily specifiable alternative form , it would represent a truly major advance in our understanding of quantum many - body physics .",
    "indeed , even as a conjecture it has been invoked in discussing systems as diverse as ultra - cold gases of trapped atoms @xcite and the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "since kss first conjectured their bound , the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density has been investigated in a variety of systems , @xcite .",
    "the smallest reported measurement of @xmath0 has been associated with the qgp at rhic @xcite .",
    "( a more recent analysis of the data from rhic may actually be consistent with a violation of the proposed bound @xcite . ) since the @xmath0 bound may ( or may not ) have a rather extensive scope , it is important to understand in which types of systems one should expect the bound to hold .    as will be discussed in some detail below ,",
    "the conjectured domains of validity of the conjecture differ radically from form to form .",
    "moreover , apparently innocuous changes in the formulation of the variants of the conjecture can radically alter the systems for which they apply .",
    "accordingly , it is important in dealing with this subject to clarify the precise nature of the various forms of the conjecture and , in particular , to which physical systems they might apply .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : evidence ] , we begin with a brief discussion of evidence in favor of the kss bound in any of its forms . in sec .  [",
    "sect : classification ] , we classify a set of possible domains of applicability for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) might hold .",
    "the various forms of the conjecture proposed by kss will form a subset of these .",
    "having delineated the various forms , we critically examine the physical systems for which these variants actually apply . in secs .",
    "[ sect : class1 ] , [ sect : class2 ] , and [ sect : class3 ] , we address the key issue of the evidence that any particular variation of the conjecture might be valid . a natural question in this context",
    "is whether one can construct a theoretical counterexample to a particular variant . in these sections ,",
    "we will present counterexamples to a number of variants of the conjecture . in this context , we discuss in sec .",
    "vic a subtle issue raised in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the interplay of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic limits for the counter - example in sec .",
    "[ sect : class3 ] ( a heavy meson system based on a uv - complete quantum field theory ) .",
    "as will be seen , while ref .",
    "@xcite raises a profound issue , ultimately , it does not invalidate the counterexample .    in these sections we also point out that much of the evidence which seems to support the conjecture in some general way is applicable only to variants of the conjecture which have been ruled out by the counterexamples",
    "thus , our ultimate conclusion is that the evidence for the conjecture in any of its forms is rather weak .",
    "if the bound is correct , it appears that this would have to be due to some deep physics ( for instance , due to some aspects of quantum gravity as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , or the string- or m- theory underlying the field theories used to describe nature ) beyond the frameworks of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sect : summary ] .",
    "we relegate a number of the computational details to various appendices .",
    "before we begin , it is useful to briefly review the arguments of kss that have led to their proposed bound .",
    "the argument makes use of the ads / cft duality from string theory @xcite .",
    "it is argued that in higher dimensional gravity theories , black branes ( higher - dimensional analogs of black holes ) have finite temperature field theory duals ( specifically , @xmath8 supersymmetric yang - mills theories at large @xmath9 and infinite t hooft coupling @xmath10 ) that possess hydrodynamic properties such as viscosity .",
    "these hydrodynamic properties can be related to gravitational properties of the black branes , and the correspondence can be used to compute transport properties @xcite . using these methods",
    "the ratio @xmath0 can be computed .",
    "a number of theories in this class have been studied in the large @xmath9 limit at infinite ",
    "t hooft coupling .",
    "all of them have saturated the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) @xcite .",
    "a general argument has been given that all theories in this class at large @xmath9 and infinite ",
    "t hooft coupling must saturate the bound @xcite .",
    "moreover , one generally expects that as one weakens the coupling of an interacting system , the viscosity should increase .",
    "one might , therefore , expect that as the  t hooft coupling is decreased from infinity , the ratio @xmath0 should increase .",
    "this has been seen in an explicit calculation for the first correction due to finite ",
    "t hooft coupling for one particular theory @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems quite plausible that @xmath0 is bounded as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) , at least for those large @xmath9 field theories which have super - gravity holographic duals .",
    "the interesting question is whether the bound holds for some general class of theories beyond this , and if so for which class of theories . note that apart from the field - theoretic calculations based on ads / cft , there is no reliable method to calculate @xmath0 for _ any _ strongly coupled quantum fluid , yet it is this class of fluids for which one expects the smallest values of @xmath0 .",
    "the optimistic view is that there could exist a very general property of some large class of quantum fluids ; namely , the @xmath0 bound , which was unnoticed prior to the ads / cft calculations in large measure because there was no tractable way to compute the entropy and viscosity properties for strongly coupled theories .",
    "of course , nature itself is an excellent analog computer , and one way to probe whether there is a bound which applies to the class of theories that describe the real world is to ask whether there are any known fluids which violate the putative bound . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kss examined a number of real life fluids , including liquid helium , liquid nitrogen , and water , under a variety of conditions and found no examples where the bound was violated .",
    "typically , the ratio @xmath0 for these fluids was found to be orders of magnitude larger than the bound .",
    "this empirical data appears to be one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the existence of a bound .",
    "additionally , a more heuristic argument can be made for the existence of a bound @xcite .",
    "consider a relatively dilute fluid which for simplicity is composed of one type of particle . by dilute we mean : i ) that the dynamics of the system is dominated by two - body scattering , and ii ) that the mean - free path @xmath11 between collisions is much larger than both the thermal wavelength @xmath12 of the system and the characteristic range of the interaction . in effect , this dilute regime is weakly coupled from the point of many - body physics ; quantum many - body effects are unimportant .",
    "this is the regime which can be accurately described via a boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "a simple kinetic theory estimate of the shear viscosity in this regime was derived long ago by maxwell : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density and @xmath15 is the thermal momentum , and we have used the dilute - gas relation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the scattering cross - section at thermal energies @xcite .",
    "( for a nonrelativistic system @xmath18 , while for a relativistic system @xmath19 . ) in the dilute regime ,",
    "the entropy density is well approximated by the free gas entropy density , and up to logarithmic corrections in @xmath20 and @xmath21 the entropy density @xmath2 is just proportion to the density . combining these relations allows us to write the ration @xmath0 as @xmath22    clearly , the expression for @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ handwave ] ) is monotonically decreasing with @xmath14 . at first glance",
    "one might think that by simply increasing @xmath14 one can reduce @xmath0 to as small a value as one likes .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ handwave ] ) is only a useful estimate in the dilute limit .",
    "increasing the density , the mean free path shrinks , and eventually becomes comparable to either the range of the interaction or the thermal wavelength . beyond this point ,",
    "quantum effects alter the analysis , and one enters a strongly coupled regime . presumably , these quantum many - body effects cause the ratio of @xmath0 to stop decreasing and begin increasing . from these simple scaling arguments ,",
    "it is easy to see that the density for @xmath23 occurs when @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , at the length scale for which the quantum many - body effects are expected to begin to increase the ratio @xmath0 , the effective minimum ( and hence the lower bound ) of @xmath0 is on the order of 1 .",
    "such general scaling and uncertainty arguments suggest that for any given system the minimum value of @xmath0 will likely be of order unity ( or larger if the thermal wavelength is shorter than the range of the interaction ) .",
    "this argument is heuristic and does not explain why the number of order unity should be @xmath25 , but it is certainly consistent with it",
    ". a somewhat more sophisticated version of this argument may be found in ref .",
    "to discuss the various versions of the kss conjecture systematically , it is useful to classify the possible domains of validity of the bound . in doing",
    "so we focus on two distinguishable aspects of the domains of validity .",
    "the first aspect is the type of theory for which the conjecture is supposed to apply .",
    "the bound was originally found in a very limited class of theories  large @xmath9 gauge theories with super - gravity duals  and assumed to hold for a broader class of theories .",
    "thus , the first matter that we need to characterize are the classes of theories for which the bound may hold .",
    "the second aspect to be characterized is the degree of stability of a fluid described by some given class of underlying dynamical theory .",
    "in particular , this second classification delineates whether the bound is to be taken to hold for stable fluids only , or for long - lived metastable fluids as well .",
    "table i outlines a set of possible categories for both of the above aspects of the domain of validity for the bound .",
    "the listing of theory classes is intended to be ordered , more or less , in decreasing scope : _",
    "i.e. , _ as one descends the list , the possible number of fluids which can be described by each subsequent set of theories decreases .    1 .   class of underlying theories 1 .",
    "any quantum mechanical system .",
    "any nonrelativistic quantum mechanical system with one component of spin 0 or 1/2 .",
    "any `` sensible '' quantum field theory . 1 .",
    "any `` sensible '' quantum field theory with @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   stability class of fluids 1 .",
    "absolutely stable fluids only 2 .",
    "metastable and stable fluids    using the classifications delineated in table i , each variant of the conjecture can be labelled by a pair of characters , one chosen from the list of classes of underlying theories , and another chosen from the list of stability classes .",
    "for example , if one takes the original form of the conjecture that the bound applies to `` all fluids '' to mean that it applies to all fluids described by quantum mechanics , then the conjecture is of class 1a or 1b , depending on whether one wishes to restrict the domain of validity to absolutely stable fluids or not . note that the list of theory classes described in table i may not be an exhaustive one , but it is intended to include the natural interpretations of previously published variants of the conjecture and some modest extensions thereof .    in the next two subsections",
    ", we will further examine the classes of theories and the fluid stability classes to which the bound might apply .",
    "the first subsection will discuss the applicability of the conjecture to the various classes of the theories that we have delineated in table i. the second subsection will explore the issue of stable versus metastable fluids .",
    "after that , we will discuss the applicability of the various versions of the conjecture to different realistic fluids .",
    "a fluid can be described theoretically as a many - body system whose constituent particles are mobile enough to sample the complete position space of the fluid .",
    "we can define a ",
    "theoretical fluid \" by defining the interactions between particles that make up the fluid .",
    "of course , real fluids may be regarded as theoretical fluids as well  they are the theoretical fluids associated with the correct theory of nature .",
    "the logic of the kss conjecture is that the @xmath0 bound , which was discovered in the context of gauge theories with super - gravity duals , applies to a broader class of theories .",
    "part i of table i lists a number of possible classes of theories for which the kss bound might be taken to apply .",
    "the list of classes of theories may seem somewhat peculiar .",
    "it was generated in part to reflect the possible ways to interpret the variants of the kss conjecture on the market .",
    "there is another reason to consider these classes . in many ways ,",
    "the most natural class of theory to consider is class @xmath27 , the general class of systems describable by quantum mechanics .",
    "all of the heuristic arguments in sec .",
    "[ sect : evidence ] in support of a generalization of the kss conjecture to theories beyond those described by ads / cft at large @xmath9 apply if the generalization is to generic quantum mechanical systems .",
    "( as we will see later , this is not true of any of the alternatives . )",
    "however , it is easy to see ( by explicitly constructing counter - examples ) that this variant in its full generality _ can not _",
    "be correct .",
    "the other classes of theories in table i may be thought of as ways to restrict these classes of theories to which the bound should apply in order to evade the problems with class 1 .    as was briefly noted early on by kss @xcite and subsequently addressed in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the bound may be violated by considering a nonrelativistic fluid composed of an extremely large number of distinct species , which are all degenerate in mass , and interact with each other via identical interactions .",
    "the key point is that by increasing the number of species while keeping the total density of particles and temperature fixed , the shear viscosity @xmath1 is left essentially the same as in a single species fluid , while the entropy grows through the gibbs mixing entropy . by making the number of species exponentially large , the bound can be violated . a detailed discussion of how this works is given in sec .  [",
    "sect : class1 ] .    the variants of the conjecture considered by kss in ref .",
    "@xcite are essentially those in classes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these evade the problem of gibbs mixing entropy in very different ways .",
    "class @xmath28 does this by explicitly limiting the number of species in the fluid to no more than 2 ( the number of spin states of a spin-1/2 system ) , and thereby appears to restrict the growth in gibbs entropy .",
    "class @xmath29 does this indirectly by restricting the chemical potentials to zero : with a zero chemical potential and a quantum field theoretic system , one can not independently adjust the density of each of the particle species , since each particle density is fixed by the temperature and masses of the particle .",
    "thus by adding species at a fixed temperature , one necessarily changes the total density of particles .",
    "there is a subtlety associated with the theories of class @xmath28 .",
    "the issue concerns the precise definition of a fluid with `` one component . ''",
    "suppose that we have a many - body system with one type of particle , @xmath30 , which interacts through some two - body potential .",
    "suppose further that this interaction is attractive and some number of two - body ( and/or many - body ) bound states ( molecules ) exist .",
    "one might wish to regard a fluid composed of particles of type @xmath30 as a fluid with one component , since ultimately everything in the fluid is composed of one type of particle .",
    "however , the kinetic degrees of freedom whose motion describes the fluid include both the atoms and the molecules , and the system is effectively a multi - component fluid .",
    "furthermore , one may naively suggest that fluids which are composed from only one type of molecule , such as water , may be considered as having a single species .",
    "however , water molecules ( and many other molecules ) have rotational and vibrational excitations which can be accessible .",
    "these excitations cause the fluid to act like a multi - species fluid with each excited state behaving as a distinct species .",
    "for the purposes of the discussion here , we will therefore consider a system to be of `` one component '' only if either of the following two conditions are met : first , the particles making up the fluid do not form bound states , and second , the internal excitation energies of the particles are sufficiently high so that the excited states are not populated due to the temperature .",
    "otherwise , we will consider the system to be a multi - component fluid .",
    "variants associated with class @xmath31 , which limit the conjectured bound s applicability to systems described by  sensible quantum field theories , \" attempt to evade the entropy problem in a more subtle way . the modifier  sensible \"",
    "was introduced in this context by son and starinets @xcite . in this context , the term  sensible \" might be taken as a synonym for  well defined \"  that is , a quantum field theory in which , at least in principle , all observables may be calculated without additional _ ad hoc _ input . from a practical perspective",
    ", the term `` sensible '' may be taken to refer to uv - complete theories ; namely , those which are sensible down to arbitrarily short distances , and thus do not require additional prescriptions for dealing with uncontrolled short - distance physics .",
    "thus , `` sensible quantum field theories '' would be taken to include asymptotically free field theories such as qcd or conformal field theories .",
    "it should be noted here that the classes of theories believed to be uv - complete are rather limited .",
    "many renormalizable theories with which we have considerable experience are probably not ",
    "sensible \" ( at least perturbatively ) in the sense used here .",
    "for example , theories such as qed and linear sigma models are presumably not `` sensible '' in that it is generally thought that unless they are trivial , they are likely to be ill defined in the ultraviolet",
    ".    how might the restriction to `` sensible '' quantum field theories possibly evade the difficulty posed by gibbs mixing entropy ? recall that the violation of the bound may well require an extremely large number of essentially identical species of nonrelativistic particles .",
    "accordingly , it is difficult to find any realistic situation where it occurs for real world fluids .",
    "one might hope that the difficulty of constructing practical examples of such fluids might actually reflect some deep and previously undiscovered principle .",
    "this hypothetical principle must go beyond that which is contained implicitly in quantum mechanics , since quantum mechanical systems can be found which violate the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask if such a principle could have a quantum field theoretic origin .",
    "this gains some credence from the fact that the conjectured bound was first seen in a particular class of  sensible \" quantum field theories ( conformal field theories with gravity duals ) .",
    "thus , one might speculate that the bound should only apply to systems which are ultimately described by sensible quantum field theories , and therefore it should not be possible to find a uv - complete field theory that can give rise to a system that can violate the kss bound .    on its face",
    ", it seems quite implausible that constraining the relativistic field theory underlying a non - relativistic fluid to be uv - complete should somehow rule out nonrelativistic fluids of many components which violate the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) through a very large gibbs mixing entropy .",
    "after all , the short distance dynamics of the underlying quantum field theory typically occur on radically different scales than the scales of the effective degrees of freedom in the nonrelativistic gases of interest .",
    "accordingly , it is very difficult to see how a constraint on the dynamics on @xmath0 for the fluid can arise naturally .",
    "moreover , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , even after units are restored the speed of light does not appear in the bound .",
    "thus , it is very hard to understand how the origin of the bound could be related to the relativistic nature of the underlying field theory .",
    "the preceding arguments suggest that it is very hard understand from first principles why a restriction to `` sensible '' relativistic field theories ought to yield the bound .",
    "however , naive attempts to increase the number of nonrelativistic species of particles in a gas by increasing the number of types of particles in the underlying quantum field theory can easily cause a theory to lose asymptotic freedom and thereby ceasing to be a `` sensible '' quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it is useful to illustrate how this can happen .",
    "let us consider a nonrelativistic gas which is predominantly composed of one type of pion of mass @xmath32 , for instance the @xmath33 .",
    "such a gas undoubtedly has its origins in qcd , a uv - complete quantum field theory .",
    "to describe such a gas in the context of qcd , we can consider the theory at a finite temperature @xmath21 , and a chemical potential @xmath34 for the up quark @xmath35 of the form @xmath36 .",
    "( it is unnecessary to also impose a chemical potential for the down quarks . )",
    "if the system is in the regime @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a typical hadronic scale of order 1 gev , then it is essentially a nonrelativistic gas of @xmath33 mesons .",
    "now suppose that we wish to generalize this to a many - species pion gas . to do this ,",
    "let us generalize qcd to include @xmath40 degenerate flavors of quarks with @xmath40 large and even .",
    "suppose we add a common chemical potential @xmath41 for half of the flavors : @xmath42 while keeping @xmath37 .",
    "this will create a nonrelativistic system containing @xmath43 types of pions ( each one with a quark of type @xmath44 with @xmath45 and an anti - quark of type @xmath46 with @xmath47 ) . by carefully tuning @xmath41 while increasing @xmath40 , the total density of pions",
    "can be kept fixed while increasing the number of species .",
    "this appears to allow one to create the conditions in which the gibbs entropy dominates the ratio of @xmath0 and causes a violation of the kss bound .",
    "however , there is a catch . recall that for small @xmath48 , the beta function for qcd is given by @xmath49 asymptotic freedom requires that @xmath50 . by increasing @xmath40 in order to violate the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) , the underlying theory is pushed outside of the domain of `` sensible '' theories . of course",
    ", one might try to evade this by increasing @xmath9 at the same time as one increases @xmath40 ; by fixing the ratio @xmath51 as the large @xmath40 limit is taken , asymptotic freedom can be maintained .",
    "however , recall that the cross section for @xmath52 scattering scales as @xmath53 @xcite . for a weakly interacting fluid , the shear viscosity is expected to scale with the inverse of the cross - section @xcite .",
    "thus , by increasing @xmath9 along with @xmath40 to maintain asymptotic freedom and keep the theory sensible , one finds that @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gibbs mixing entropy grows only with @xmath55 , so @xmath56 for large @xmath40 . as a result , in a pion gas in the large number of species",
    "limit , the decrease in the cross section associated with the @xmath9 scaling necessary to maintain asymptotic freedom overwhelms the increase in gibbs mixing entropy due the to the @xmath40 scaling , and @xmath0 is driven to infinity in the combined @xmath57 limit .",
    "the example of pion gases in qcd shows how the restriction to a `` sensible '' theory can prevent the system from ever getting into a regime where the gibbs mixing entropy dominates the ratio of @xmath0 and thus violates the kss bound .",
    "the central question underlying the theories associated with class @xmath31 is whether the situation seen for pion gases in qcd is paradigmatic for all sensible theories .",
    "there is an additional important subtlety associated with the notion of `` sensible '' in class @xmath31 ; namely , whether the standard model should be regarded as a sensible quantum field theory .",
    "the standard model contains scalar fields and is probably _ not _ uv - complete .",
    "this implies that class 3 should not apply to the standard model _ per se_.",
    "however , the standard model may be regarded as the low energy effective theory for some theory ( a field theory , a string theory , or something else ) which _ must _ make sense in the ultraviolet since it describes nature .",
    "thus , it might be useful to regard `` the standard model , '' as described in the textbooks , to include the appropriate uv - completion for real world situations , and hence be `` sensible . ''",
    "having delineated some of the possible domains of validity of the conjectured bound on @xmath0 , in the next subsection we will discuss the matter to which stability classes of fluids the conjectured bound may apply .",
    "in addition to distinguishing variants of the conjecture according to the classes of underlying theories to which they apply , we also need to discuss the stability classes of the fluids for which the @xmath0 bound may apply .",
    "a fluid can be described as either stable or metastable . in this subsection",
    ", we will examine some of the issues associated with the applicability of the bound to stable and metastable fluids .",
    "we are defining a metastable fluid to be one which is in a macroscopic state which is not the state of lowest free energy ; such a fluid is expected to decay over time to the true macroscopic ground state .",
    "if the time scale of the decay is extremely long compared to other relevant time scales , the fluid is considered to be metastable .",
    "a stable fluid , on the other hand , is one in which no decay is possible , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fluid is in its ground state and will remain there unless it is perturbed .",
    "metastable fluids are characterized by at least two relevant time scales .",
    "first , there is @xmath58 , which is the longest microscopic time scale relevant for fluid motion . in practice , for a typical real world fluid",
    ", @xmath58 might be taken to be several times the characteristic collision time between molecules .",
    "thus , @xmath58 characterizes the minimum time scale for which it is meaningful to talk about macroscopic fluid behavior .",
    "next , there is the time scale @xmath59 for the decay from a metastable fluid to a stable ( that is , lowest - energy ) configuration .",
    "the characterization of the fluid clearly depends on the ratio @xmath60 . if @xmath61 or less , then the decay time is of the same order or less than the characteristic time for fluid - like behavior , and it is not meaningful to describe the system as being in a well - characterized fluid state . in effect , in such a regime the fluid is so unstable that one can not measure properties like shear viscosity or entropy before the system decays into a qualitatively different type of fluid .",
    "however , if @xmath62 , the decay time scale is much longer than the time scale of the measurements needed to determine fluid properties such as the shear viscosity . in this case , the fluid can be said to be metastable , and properties such as viscosity and entropy are essentially well defined in the metastable phase . for an extremely large @xmath59 , the metastable fluid acts to a very good approximation as if it were a stable fluid .",
    "we should note that many systems which we obviously characterize as fluids in the real world are actually metastable .",
    "an extreme example is nitroglycerin ( @xmath63 ) . above its melting point of @xmath64c",
    "it is clearly a fluid  it will slosh around in a beaker .",
    "however , liquid nitroglycerin is obviously _ not _ in a configuration at the minimum of the free energy  considerable energy can be released when the molecules break up and rearrange .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the real world , @xmath59 for metastable fluids is typically _ many _ orders of magnitude larger than @xmath58 .",
    "there are two ways in which a system can be metastable in the sense used here .",
    "the first is the rather typical example in statistical physics in which a macroscopic phase is locally stable while being globally unstable .",
    "that is , any small fluctuation of a macroscopic fluid property ( _ e.g. _ , density ) from its value in the metastable phase increases the free energy , but large fluctuations can lower it .",
    "this is quite familiar in systems which can undergo first - order phase transitions .",
    "the system can be beyond the phase transition point but stay in the old phase .",
    "thus , for example , water may be supercooled or the relative humidity can be greater than 100% .",
    "such systems can live for a very long time ( if undisturbed ) since there is barrier which must be either surmounted via thermal fluctuation or tunnelled through quantum mechanically . in either case , if the barriers are large , the lifetimes of the metastable phases grow exponentially .",
    "there is a second way for a system to be metastable .",
    "a system can be locally unstable in terms of _ some _ thermodynamic variables , but the time scale associated with the local instability can be very long .",
    "it is this sort of metastability which is relevant for many of the discussions in this paper .",
    "for example , this can happen in chemical systems",
    ". a system can be in thermal equilibrium kinetically but not chemically ; however , the time scale for reaching chemical equilibrium can be very large .",
    "suppose , for example , that one initially has a gas composed of molecules of one type , @xmath30 .",
    "suppose further that the reaction @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are two other types of molecules ) is exothermic , but the reaction rate is _ very _ small compared to the rate of elastic scattering of particles of type @xmath30 .",
    "this will happen if the activation energy for the reaction is well above the temperature .",
    "in such a case , over very long time scales the system will act like a fluid of molecules of type @xmath30 in thermal equilibrium kinetically , despite being out of thermal equilibrium chemically .",
    "locally , as well as globally , the system is not at a minimum of the free energy for all of the thermodynamic degrees of freedom , but nonetheless behaves like a fluid .",
    "we noted above that when @xmath68 , fluid properties such as shear viscosity are essentially well defined . in a strict sense , however , they are not . as a matter of principle , transport properties , such as shear viscosity ,",
    "describe the linear response of a fluid to a perturbation .",
    "this response is dynamical , and takes a certain characteristic time to play out .",
    "we can identify this time as @xmath58 .",
    "the transport properties are only well defined to the extent that the underlying fluid does not change its nature over this dynamical time scale . since a metastable fluid _ does _ change its properties over time , there is an intrinsic ambiguity in any evaluation of @xmath1 .",
    "one might expect that any uncertainty in the value of @xmath1 is roughly of relative order @xmath69 .",
    "fortunately , in a good metastable system this is an exceptionally small number , and the ambiguity is very small .",
    "the issue of metastable fluids is important in the context of the kss conjecture .",
    "the central question is whether the conjectured bound applies to metastable fluids as well as to stable fluids .",
    "this may seem like a relatively minor issue if the bound applies to the theories in class @xmath27 .",
    "then the question of whether the bound applies to metastable fluids reduces to the issue of whether it applies to normal stable fluids such as water , or whether it also applies to metastable fluids such as nitroglycerine .",
    "however , as will become apparent in the next subsection , if the bound only applies to theories in class @xmath31 , the question of whether the bound applies to metastable fluids determines the bound applicability to familiar real - world fluids .",
    "to the extent that the kss conjecture somehow captures an essential property that a system needs to possess to behave as a fluid , one might naturally assume that it should also apply to metastable systems whose macroscopic behavior is clearly that of a fluid .",
    "there is an objection of principle that could be made here , in that the conjecture is sharp  it provides a definite bound for @xmath0  while the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are intrinsically ambiguous for a metastable fluid . of course",
    ", as noted above the ambiguities are very small for long - lived metastable fluids .",
    "accordingly , it is highly plausible that the conjecture , if correct , applies to metastable fluids with one minor alteration : the bound may be slightly violated , but all possible violations must be within the scales of ambiguities of the quantities . in practice , for real metastable fluids , these violations are extraordinarily small , and as a practical matter the bound would then be taken to hold for any long - lived metastable fluid .",
    "we generally take the view that is unnatural for there to be a fundamental property which applies to all stable fluids , but which does not apply  even approximately  to metastable fluids no matter how long - lived .",
    "it seems far more natural to assume that in the limit of infinite lifetime , a metastable fluid would be indistinguishable from a stable one , and that it would share all of the essential properties of stable fluids .",
    "having said this , as a logical matter it is certainly possible that the bound only applies  even approximately  only to absolutely stable fluids .",
    "accordingly , it is important to classify the possible @xmath0 conjectures according to whether or not they apply to metastable systems .      having enumerated various forms of the conjecture , it is important to see the types of realistic fluids to which they apply . in table",
    "ii , we show the applicability of the various forms of the conjecture to four different types of fluids which serve to illustrate the broad issues of where the various classes apply .",
    "the fluids we examine  the quark - gluon plasma , liquid helium , water , and nitroglycerine  were chosen to serve as paradigms for broad classes of fluids .",
    ".table showing if each variant of the conjecture can be applied ( at least approximately ) to either the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , liquid helium ( @xmath70 ) , water ( @xmath71),liquid nitroglycerin ( @xmath63 ) ; y(es ) , n(o ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the partition function and its logarithm scales with larger number of resonant states as expected by eq .",
    "( [ eq : partscale ] ) . to further illustrate this",
    ", we plot the partition functions and their logarithms in figs .  3 and 4 , along with linear and logarithmic best - fit curves , respectively .",
    "this numerical data supports the argument that by increasing the number of resonances in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) , it is possible to increase the lower bound on the partition function of the system , and thereby increase the lower bound on the entropy .",
    "as argued in sec .  [ sect : class3 ] , the heavy meson gas that we discussed there is not susceptible to decay via tetraquark and higher - quark state formation .",
    "however , as we show in this appendix , one can not tune the parameters of the heavy meson gas to prevent the formation of all bound states .",
    "it turns out to be energetically favorable for @xmath9 heavy mesons to rearrange their quark content to form a heavy baryon and a light anti - baryon .    in order to show that the baryon configuration is more stable than the meson configuration , we must demonstrate that the binding energy is larger for the baryons than for the mesons .",
    "the binding energy of a single heavy meson should be @xmath72 .",
    "however , a rearrangement into baryons needs @xmath9 heavy mesons because the baryons must be color singlets ; thus the total binding energy of the heavy mesons is @xmath73 .",
    "the binding energy of a light anti - baryon must be @xmath74 , as @xmath75 is the only scale for the light quarks .",
    "next , we must determine the binding energy of the heavy baryon . as noted long ago by witten @xcite , a baryon composed entirely of heavy quarks in the large @xmath9 limit",
    "is described accurately in the hartree approximation for nonrelativistic quarks interacting via a color coulomb potential .",
    "we can calculate the binding energy relative for the heavy baryon parametically via a viral theorem for this hartree system .",
    "the single particle hartree hamiltonian @xmath76 for the system with @xmath9 heavy mesons has a kinetic term and a potential term : @xmath77 the kinetic term , @xmath78 , can be expressed in the typical manner in terms of the laplacian , @xmath79 where @xmath20 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the potential term , @xmath80 , can be written using a mean field approximation .",
    "the leading order one - gluon potential that binds heavy quarks together has the form of a coulombic potential , so in the mean field approximation , the potential term can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 , the strong coupling constant , has been factored outside the integral , and @xmath83 is the particle density for one of the heavy quarks ; the external factor is technically @xmath84 and indicates that each of the remaining quarks contributes .",
    "we will denote the exact single particle ground - state wave function of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : varham ] ) by @xmath85 .    in order to parameterize the energy of the ground state , instead of @xmath85",
    ", we choose @xmath86 as a variational ansatz , with @xmath87 is the variational parameter .",
    "if we choose the form of @xmath86 such that it happens to reproduce the form of the exact hartree solution , the variational equations with respect to @xmath87 will yield an exact relation , _",
    "i.e. _ a viral theorem",
    ". the ground state energy can now be determined by minimizing the hamiltonian with regards to @xmath87 . in order to perform this minimization",
    ", we must first determine how the kinetic and potential terms scale with @xmath87 . using the change of variable @xmath88 it is easy to see that the kinetic term must scale as @xmath89 we have factored out @xmath90 so that @xmath91 is independent of @xmath87 , @xmath92 , @xmath82 , and @xmath9 .    to find the @xmath87-scaling of the potential energy term",
    ", we first note that the single particle density can be written in terms of the wave function @xmath85 as @xmath93 when we consider the scaling parameter , the density can be written as , @xmath94 where @xmath95 once again and the factor of @xmath96 comes from the normalization of the variational ansatz . with this expression for @xmath97 , the scaling of the potential",
    "is given by @xmath98 where we first did a change of variables from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , and then factored @xmath87 out of the integral , leaving the factor @xmath101 independent of @xmath87 , @xmath92 , @xmath9 , and @xmath82 .",
    "this has the effect of explicitly showing the @xmath87 scaling of the potential energy .    using the above results",
    ", the hamiltonian now takes a form where the @xmath87 scaling is fully explicit : @xmath102 it is now easy to minimize this equation with respect to @xmath87 , and the variational estimate of the ground state turns out to be @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the binding energy for one quark .",
    "@xmath105 is expected to be negative , indicating a bound state ; the binding energy of the heavy baryon is @xmath106 . since by construction both @xmath91 and @xmath101 are factors depending only on the form of the variational wave function and independent of @xmath87 , @xmath92 , @xmath9 , and @xmath82 one has the following scaling of the binding energy with the parameters of the problem @xmath107 note that @xmath108 , the square of the ",
    "t hooft coupling is independent of @xmath9 .    at this point",
    "we observe that before the rearrangement , the heavy mesons had a binding energy of @xmath109 , while after the rearrangement , the heavy baryon has a binding energy of @xmath110 , while the light anti - baryon has a characteristic binding energy of @xmath75 , which is negligible by comparison . since the  t hooft coupling constant scales like @xmath111 , the binding energy for the heavy baryon will always be perimetrically larger than for the @xmath9 heavy mesons ( which also scales as @xmath112 ) for a large enough value of the heavy quark mass .",
    "therefore , this rearrangement of quarks is always energetically favorable , and thus the heavy meson gas is metastable relative to this rearrangement .",
