    "the stabilizing effect of water on biomolecules is an intensively studied area in contemporary biophysical research .",
    "this is because many of the key principles governing biological functionality result from the action of the solvent , and thus water is often regarded as the `` matrix of life '' .    in theoretical work ,",
    "the important factor `` solvent '' needs to be taken into account too , or the studied system will be unphysical .",
    "there are two main ways of solvent treatment in biophysical research .",
    "one is to embed the biomolecule of interest into a box of explicit solvent molecules resolved into full atomic detail @xcite .",
    "the alternative form is to consider the solvent as structureless continuum and describe the response of the environment with implicit solvation methods @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to describing the electrostatic component within implicit solvation models .",
    "efficient solutions have become popular in the form of _ generalized born _ ( gb )",
    "models @xcite as well as _ poisson - boltzmann _ models ( pb ) @xcite . solutions to the pb are computed either by the finite difference method ( fdpb ) @xcite or by the boundary element method ( pb / bem ) @xcite .",
    "considerable computational savings are expected from the latter because the problem can be reduced from having to solve a volume integral in fdpb to solving a surface integral in pb / bem .",
    "either approach is sensitive to the degree of discretization into grid elements or boundary elements @xcite .    aside from the electrostatic component",
    "there are also apolar contributions to consider @xcite . especially in the context of nonpolar molecules ,",
    "such factors often become the dominant terms in the solvation free energy . a common way to treat these nonpolar contributions",
    "is to introduce a sasa - term , which means measuring the solvent accessible surface area ( sasa ) and weighing it with an empirically determined factor .",
    "although commonly employed , this procedure has become the subject of intensive debates @xcite .",
    "not only were sasa terms found to be inappropriate for representing the cavitation term @xcite , but also is the weighing factor  usually associated with surface tension  completely ill - defined in an atomic scale context @xcite .",
    "while the short range character of dispersion and repulsion forces occurring at the boundary between solute and solvent would imply that sasa can describe these kinds of interactions , a recent careful analysis has shown that at least for dispersion such a relationship is not justified @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy arising with sasa - terms has been recognized by many groups and its persistent employment may be largely due to sizeable cancellation of error effects .",
    "methodic advancement has recently been reported within the newest release of amber @xcite where gb was augmented by a volume term @xcite and the inclusion of dispersion terms was found to significantly improve the general predictive quality of pb .",
    "of particular interest are systematic and physics - based decompositions that allow for separate consideration of each of the terms involved . in quantum mechanics ( qm )",
    "such a technique has long been established with the polarizable continuum model ( pcm ) @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems advisable to use techniques like pcm as a reference system whenever additional method development is performed , especially when regarding the multitude of technical dependencies continuum solvation models are faced with @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we describe a systematic process to introduce dispersion terms in the context of the pb / bem approach .",
    "the pcm model , that treats dispersion and repulsion terms from first - principles , is used as a reference system along with experimental data .",
    "different ways of calculating dispersion- , repulsion contributions in pcm have recently been compared @xcite . for our purposes",
    "the caillet - claverie method @xcite was implemented since it seems to offer a good compromise between accuracy and computational overhead .",
    "this method was also chosen in earlier versions of pcm @xcite and thus represents a proven concept within the bem framework .",
    "the fundamental role of dispersion and the potential danger of misinterpreting hydrophobicity related phenomena by ignoring it has been underlined recently @xcite .    after determination of appropriate dispersion constants used in the caillet - claverie approach we apply our model to a series of proteins of increasing size . in this way we can analyze the relative contribution of the individual terms as a function of system size .",
    "moreover , we have carried out semi - empirical calculations on the same series of proteins and can therefore compare effects resulting from different charge assignments to each other .",
    "the semi - empirical program localscf @xcite also allowed for estimation of the polarization free energies according to the cosmo model @xcite , which could be readily used for direct comparison to pb / bem data .",
    "we use the following decomposition of the solvation free energy @xmath0 where the individual terms represent polarization , cavitation and dispersion contributions . explicit consideration of repulsion is not necessary as the cavitation term includes these interactions . pb / bem methodology is used for @xmath1 at the boundary specification described @xcite .",
    "the cavitation term is expressed via the revised pierotti approximation @xcite @xmath2 is computed from the caillet - claverie formula @xcite projected onto the boundary elements as suggested by floris et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath3 where the first sum is over different atom types , @xmath4 , composing one molecule of solvent , the second sum is over all solute atoms , @xmath5 , and the sum over @xmath6 is over all surface elements resulting from an expansion of the molecular surface by the dimension of radius @xmath7 of a particular solvent atom , see figure [ fig1 ] for a graphical representation . here",
    "solvent atoms are shown in grey and solute atoms are represented as white circles .",
    "the scheme corresponds to one particular choice of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , if the solvent molecule in figure [ fig1 ] is water , then the scenery depicts the first of two possibilities where @xmath4 refers to the oxygen atom .",
    "after @xmath4 is set , all atom radii of the solute are increased by the amount of the atomic radius of oxygen and the molecular surface ( dashed line in figure [ fig1 ] ) is reconstructed .",
    "next the inner double sum is carried out where @xmath8 is the total number of solute atoms and @xmath9 is the total number of bes forming the interface .",
    "note that index @xmath5 serves for a double purpose , looping over all solute atoms as well as defining the type of atomic radius to use . at every combination @xmath10 of solute atoms with bes ,",
    "the expression emphasized by the curly bracket in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] must be evaluated . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are dispersion coefficients and @xmath7 , @xmath13 are atomic radii , all of them determined empirically by caillet - claverie @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "@xmath14 is the distance between the center of some be , @xmath6 , and the center of a solute atom , @xmath5 .",
    "after the expression in the curly bracket of eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] has been evaluated it must be multiplied with a scalar product between the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the inwards pointing normal vector corresponding to the @xmath17 be . the remainder of eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] is multiplication with a constant factor @xmath18 and multiplication with @xmath19 , the partial area of the be , @xmath6 .",
    "after all possible combinations @xmath10 have been considered , the procedure is repeated with an incremented @xmath4 , now referring to the h - atom , the second type of atom in a molecule of water .",
    "the molecular surface is recomputed , extended by the dimension of the atomic radius of hydrogen , and the entire inner double sum will be repeated as outlined for the case of oxygen .",
    "however , since both h - atoms in the solvent molecule are identical this step needs to be done only once and @xmath20 , the number of occurrences of a particular atom type @xmath4 , will take care of the rest ( in the case of water @xmath21 for oxygen and @xmath22 for hydrogen ) .",
    "finally , @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] represents the number density of the solvent .",
    "we have restricted the approach to just the 6@xmath24-order term in the expression derived by floris et al .",
    "note that we consider molecular surfaces as defined by connolly @xcite . the partial term listed after the curly bracket in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] is the actual consequence of mapping the classical pair interaction terms onto a boundary surface @xcite .",
    "the partial expression enclosed in the curly bracket can be substituted with any other classic pair potential , for example using amber style of dispersion @xcite , @xmath25 with similar meanings of the variables used above and @xmath26 being the van der waals well depth corresponding to homogeneous pair interaction of atoms of type @xmath4 .",
    "the algorithm covering computation of dispersion is implemented in the pb / bem program polch @xcite ( serial version ) .",
    "proper functionality was tested by comparing dispersion results of 4 sample molecules , methane , propane , iso - butane and methyl - indole , against results obtained from gaussian-98 @xcite ( pcm model of water at user defined geometries ) .",
    "deviations were on the order of @xmath27 1.8 % of the g98 value , so the procedure is assumed to work correctly .",
    "the small variations are the result of employing a different molecular surface program in pb / bem @xcite . next the structures of amino acid side - chain analogues",
    "are derived from standard amber pdb @xcite geometries by making the c@xmath28-atom a hydrogen atom , adjusting the c - h bond length and deleting the rest of the pdb structure except the actual side chain of interest . in a similar process",
    ", zwitterionic forms of each type of amino acid are constructed .",
    "pb / bem calculations are carried out and net solvation free energies for solvent water are stored .",
    "a comparison is made against the experimental values listed in @xcite as well as results obtained from the pcm model in gaussian-03 @xcite .",
    "amber default charges and amber van der waals radii increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.07 are used throughout @xcite . initial deviation from the reference set",
    "is successively improved by introducing a uniform scaling factor to the dispersion coefficients @xmath11 of eq .",
    "the optimal choice of this dispersion scaling factor is identified from the minimum mean deviation against the reference data set .",
    "the initially derived optimal scaling factor is applied to the zwitterionic series , a subset of molecules for which experimental values have been compiled @xcite , and a set of 180 dipeptide conformations studied previously .",
    "when new molecules are parameterized , we use antechamber from amber-8 and resp charges based on mp2/6 - 31 g * grids of electrostatic potentials @xcite .",
    "molecular geometries are optimized in a two - step procedure , at first at b3lyp/3 - 21 g * and then at mp2/6 - 31 g * level of theory and only the final optimized structure becomes subject to the resp calculation .",
    "extensions are pursued in two directions .",
    "first , the pb / bem approach is used with solvents other than water , and the question is raised whether the optimized scaling factor for dispersion in water is of a universal nature or needs to be re - adjusted for each other type of solvent considered .",
    "secondly , we tested the introduced change when the caillet - claverie specific formalism of dispersion treatment is changed to amber - style dispersion as indicated in eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] .",
    "crystal structures of 10 proteins of increasing size are obtained from the protein data bank @xcite .",
    "the actual download site is the repository pdb - reprdb @xcite .",
    "structures are purified and processed as described previously @xcite .",
    "the pdb codes together with a characterization of main structural features of the selected test proteins are summarized in table [ table2 ] .",
    "two types of calculations are carried out using the semi - empirical model pm5 @xcite and the fast multipole moment ( fmm ) method @xcite . a single point vacuum energy calculation",
    "is followed by a single point energy calculation including the cosmo model @xcite for consideration of solvent water .",
    "the difference between the two types of single point energies should provide us with an estimate of the solvation free energy .",
    "furthermore , the finally computed set of atomic partial charges is extracted from the pm5-calculation and feeded into the pb / bem model to substitute standard amber partial charges . in this way",
    "we can examine the dependence on a chosen charge model as well as compare classic with semi - empirical qm approaches to the solvation free energy .",
    "since our main focus is on proteins , our first goal is to optimize our approach for proteins in aqueous solution .",
    "we can resort to the experimental data for amino acid side - chain analogues ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "at first we seek maximum degree of agreement between experimental and pb / bem values of the solvation free energy , @xmath29 , by multiplying a scaling factor , @xmath30 , to the caillet - claverie dispersion @xcite coefficients , @xmath11 .",
    "the remaining terms in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] are computed at the optimized conditions reported previously @xcite .",
    "we define a global deviation from the experimental data by @xmath31 where @xmath4 refers to a particular type of amino acid side - chain analogue included in the reference set of experimental values and @xmath30 is the introduced scaling factor applied to the caillet - claverie dispersion @xcite coefficients .",
    "the trend of @xmath32 for different choices of @xmath30 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . as becomes clear from figure [ fig2 ] , a scaling factor of 0.70 establishes the best match to the experimental data .",
    "a detailed comparison of individual amino acid side - chain analogues at this optimum value is given in table [ table3 ] .",
    "we achieve a mean unsigned error of 1.15 @xmath33 , hence come close to the accuracy reported recently by chang et al .",
    "@xcite , a study that agreed very well with earlier calculations carried out by shirts et al .",
    "@xcite and maccallum et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as interesting as total solvation free energies are the constituting partial terms and how they compare to their analogous counter parts in a high - level qm model such as pcm .",
    "we therefore studied all amino acid side - chain analogues with pcm @xcite calculations at the becke-98 @xcite level of density functional theory ( dft ) using the high - quality basis set of sadlej @xcite and program gaussian-03 @xcite .",
    "a summary of these data is given in table [ table4 ] .",
    "since in pb / bem we do not consider repulsion explicitly , the pb / bem dispersion term is compared to the sum of @xmath2 and @xmath34 of pcm .",
    "it becomes clear from table [ table4 ] that there is rather general agreement in polarization terms but sizeable divergence in the apolar terms .",
    "however , the sum of all apolar terms , ie . @xmath35 and @xmath2 , appears to be again in good agreement when comparing pb / bem with pcm .",
    "the reason for the difference in the apolar terms is largely due to a different cavitation formalism used in pb / bem , which we currently believe to represent a very good approximation to this term @xcite .      in order to test the pb / bem approach further we used the initially determined scaling factor for dispersion coefficients of 0.70 to compute water solvation free energies of a series of other molecules .",
    "the procedure for obtaining atomic partial charges is described in section [ model_calib ] .",
    "it is important to note that the electron density used for resp fitting must be of mp2/6 - 31 g * quality to achieve maximum degree of compatibility to standard amber charges , which have been found to mimic high quality calculations very well @xcite .",
    "experimental reference values have been obtained from the extensive compilation by li et al . @xcite .",
    "the data comprising 18 arbitrarily selected molecules are summarized in table [ table5 ] .",
    "the mean unsigned error of 1.18 @xmath33 for this set of molecules comes close to pcm quality and must be considered very satisfactory again .",
    "another class of molecules we looked into are amino acids in their zwitterionic form , where due to the charges at the amino / carboxy groups the net solvation free energies become larger by about an order of magnitude . a comparison against the recently reported data by chang et al .",
    "@xcite is given in table [ table6 ] .",
    "the degree of agreement is still considerably high and there is no obvious indication of a systematic deviation .    a final comparison is made against a series of 180 molecules that has been used in a previous study @xcite .",
    "these structures include all 20 types of naturally occurring amino acids in 9 different conformations ( zwitterionic forms assumed ) .",
    "the set of dipeptides has been subjected to pcm @xcite calculations at the becke-98 dft level @xcite using sadlej s basis set @xcite .",
    "average net solvation free energies are formed from all 9 different conformations per type of amino acid ( or the number of available reference calculations ) and the results are presented in table i in the supplementary material .",
    "considering the variation with respect to conformational flexibility the match must still be considered to be reasonably good .",
    "it is interesting to note that the variability of the dispersion contributions alone , considered isolated per se as a function of conformational flexibility is much less pronounced than what we see for the net solvation ( see table ii of the supplementary material ) .",
    "an important aspect of the pb / bem approach is how the identified scaling factor for caillet - claverie dispersion coefficients  0.70 in the case of water  translates into other situations of non - aqueous solvation .",
    "we have therefore repeated the studies for identifying optimal boundaries @xcite for solvents methanol , ethanol and n - octanol .",
    "again we consider pcm cavities of the set of 180 dipeptide structures as reference systems and search for the best match in volumes and surfaces dependent on slightly enlarged or shrinked standard amber van der waals radii .",
    "we again employ the molecular surface program sims @xcite .",
    "detailed material of this fit is included in the supplementary material ( tables iii - viii and figures i - vi ) .",
    "we find to have to marginally increase amber van der waals radii by factors of 1.06 in solvents methanol and ethanol and 1.05 in solvent n - octanol . based on these conditions for proper locations of the solute - solvent interface",
    "we then repeat the search for appropriate scaling factors of dispersion coefficients that result in close agreement to experimental solvation free energies ( see section [ scalf_0.70 ] ) .",
    "results are presented in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "it becomes clear that the factor of 0.70 , optimal for water , is not universally applicable .",
    "rather , we find for ethanol 0.82 and for n - octanol 0.74 to be the optimal choices .",
    "a detailed comparison against experimental values at optimized conditions is given in tables [ table7 ] and [ table8 ] .",
    "we achieve mean unsigned errors of 1.38 @xmath33 for ethanol and 1.27 @xmath33 for n - octanol .",
    "cavitation terms of similar quality to the ones presented in @xcite , which are needed in pb / bem , are available for methanol and ethanol ( unpublished work in progress ) or obtained from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we can not do the calculations for methanol because of the lack of experimental values and the non - systematic trend in dispersion scaling factors of the other alcoholic solvents .",
    "all optimized parameter sets for the various types of solvents are summarized in table [ table9 ] .",
    "a series of proteins of different size , shape and total net charge ( see table [ table2 ] ) is computed within the pb / bem approach at optimized conditions for aqueous solvation , that is using a caillet - claverie dispersion coefficient scaling factor of 0.70 , slightly increased amber van der waals radii by a factor of 1.07 and standard amber partial charges . in addition to this classic approximation",
    "we also carry out semi - empirical qm calculations with the help of program localscf @xcite using the pm5 model . from the semi",
    "- empirical calculation we extract atomic partial charges and use these instead of amber partial charges within the pb / bem approach .",
    "results of these calculations are presented in table [ table11 ] and figure [ fig5 ] . in general one can observe a rather constant 20 % of the classic amber based @xmath29 estimate when switching to pm5 charges .",
    "this is independent of the size , shape or net charge of the system ( compare red bars with purple bars in figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the polarization term constitutes the major contribution but apolar terms are far from negligible ( compare magnitude of blue and black bars to green and grey bars in figure [ fig5 ] ) . when using the cosmo approximation within the semi - empirical method and deriving solvation free energies from that we get entirely uncorrelated results for the solvation free energy , @xmath29 ( see 9@xmath24 column in table [ table11 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the surface to volume ratio drops to a value around 0.25 with increasing protein size , whereas typical values in the range of 0.80 to 1.0 are maintained in the initial calibration phase , hence care must be taken with large scale extrapolations from small molecular reference data .",
    "motivated by our recent high - performance implementation of poisson - boltzmann calculations @xcite we now complement this approach with a systematic inclusion of apolar effects .",
    "in particular the important dispersion contribution is introduced and fine - tuned against available experimental data .",
    "this is based on physics - based terms , that have long been considered in a similar fashion within qm models @xcite .",
    "the resulting model is applied to a series of protein structures , and size and charge effects are examined .",
    "direct assessment of the predictive quality of the pb / bem approach after calibration has revealed rather good performance indicators for pb / bem .",
    "this was based on suggested scaling factors applied to caillet - claverie dispersion coefficients . since the original aim of caillet - claverie was to explain crystal data , we would expect a need for re - adjustment in this present implementation .",
    "moreover , since the boundary and the rest of the pb / bem model is based on amber parameterization it does not come as a surprise that one has to adjust a non - related second set of van der waals parameters in order to achieve general agreement to a reference data set .",
    "related to this point it seems particularly encouraging that when replacing the scaled caillet - claverie part with standard amber - dispersion terms for water no further refinement is necessary and similar levels of precision are established automatically . in the case of water , this brings in a second advantage . because the employed tip3p model assigns van der waals radii of zero to the h - atoms , so the effective sum over @xmath4 in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] may be truncated already after the oxygen atom .",
    "the second cycle considering h - atoms in water would add only zeros any more .",
    "a somewhat critical issue is the determination of missing parameters or the estimation of solvent probe sphere radii for different types of solvents . in this present work we found it convenient to make use of electron density grids and corresponding iso - density thresholds to define the boundary of molecules .",
    "for example to determine the probe sphere radius of methanol we compute the volume of a single molecule of methanol up to an electron density threshold of 0.0055 a.u . and derive an effective radius assuming spherical relationships .",
    "the same threshold criterion is applied to all other solvents leading to the data summarized in table [ table9 ] .",
    "electron grids are based on b98/sadlej calculations .",
    "similarly we determine atomic van der waals radii for cl- or br - containing substances from iso - density considerations .",
    "however in these latter cases the threshold criterion is adapted to a level that re - produces proper dimensions of well - known types , ie neighboring c- , o- , n - atoms and at this level the unknown radius is determined . in the case of n - octanol",
    "the assumption of spherical geometry is certainly not justified . on the other hand",
    "the concept of an over - rolling probe sphere representing approaching solvent molecules will remain a hypothetical model construct anyway . complying with this model",
    "construct it may be argued that over time the average of approaching solvent molecules will hit the solute with all parts ( head , tail or body regions of the solvent molecule ) equally often and thus the idealized spherical probe is not entirely unreasonable .",
    "another interesting aspect is the fact that the present pb / bem approach is all based on molecular surfaces rather than sasas .",
    "this is of technical interest and the consequence of that is a greatly reduced sensitivity to actual probe sphere dimensions .",
    "a graphical explanation is given in the supplementary material ( figure vii ) . while sasa based surfaces would see significant changes when probe spheres are slightly modified ( blue sphere replaced by red sphere in figure vii of the supplementary material ) the molecular surface itself faces only a minor change in the reentrant domain ( green layer indicated in figure vii of the supplementary material ) .",
    "large scale extrapolations resulting from a calibration process done with small sized reference structures have to be taken with care .",
    "because of the drop of surface to volume ratios the most important requirement for such a strategy is to have the individual terms properly analyzed whether they scale with the volume , or the surface . for pb",
    "/ bem the question reduces to the cavitation term , since the remainder is mainly a function of coulombic interactions .",
    "as that particular aspect has been carefully analyzed in previous studies @xcite we are confident that a large - scale extrapolation actually works in the way suggested in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] .",
    "a final remark may be relevant with regard to the discrepancy seen in using classic amber partial charges versus semi - empirical pm5 charges .",
    "intuitively , one is tempted to believe stronger in the pm5 results .",
    "there might however also be a small drift in energies introduced by pm5/pm3 models as has been observed within an independent series of single point calculations ( see supplementary material figure viii ) .",
    "consideration of dispersion effects within a physics - based continuum solvation model significantly improves accuracy and general applicability of such an approach .",
    "the proposed method follows a proven concept @xcite and is easily implemented into existing models .",
    "generalization to different treatments of dispersion as well as extension to non - aqueous solvents is straightforward .",
    "this work was supported by the national institutes of health grant gm62838 .",
    "we thank fqs poland and the fujitsu group , for kindly providing a temporary test version of program localscf @xcite .",
