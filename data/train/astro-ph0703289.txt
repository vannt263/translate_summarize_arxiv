    "traditionally , bl  lacertae objects have been found from radio and x - ray surveys ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or from comparisons between source catalogs in these two wavelength regions @xcite .",
    "past optical searches have had very little success in finding these rare types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , searches using a variety of methods have failed to identify examples of radio - quiet bl  lac objects in analogy to radio - quiet qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * )    it is easy to appreciate the difficulties encountered by optical searches .",
    "first , the main optical signatures of bl  lac objects are not among the properties that have been exploited to identify other types of agn . for example , their strong and rapid variations in flux and polarization have been of little help since large - scale surveys based on variability that have the required depth are simply too difficult and time consuming given currently available instrumentation .",
    "second , the lack of strong spectral lines in bl  lac objects denies the easiest method to spectroscopically identify members of the class .",
    "this is particularly true for objects at the lower - luminosity end of the bl  lac object distribution , because starlight from the host galaxy can help to mask the featureless synchrotron continuum , making broad - band color selection very difficult .    despite the inherent problems in optically searching for bl  lac objects , finding a sample of these agn in a manner completely independent from their radio and x - ray properties would be an important advance .",
    "for instance , a purely optically - selected sample would explore the range of properties exhibited by bl  lac objects with presumably different selection biases than those encountered in x - ray and radio surveys .",
    "in addition , deep optical surveys have the potential to provide a more complete census of bl  lac objects than the relatively shallow , large - area x - ray and radio surveys currently available .    in recent years ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the two - degree field qso redshift survey ( 2qz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have presented an opportunity to search for bl  lac objects by exploiting one of their defining characteristics : their featureless optical continua .",
    "both surveys have been used to produce catalogs of candidate bl  lac objects by finding quasi - featureless spectra within their huge spectroscopic databases . @xcite",
    "describe the selection and properties of the 2qz bl  lac object sample that contains over 50 candidates . for the sdss , @xcite ( c05 )",
    "have used similar optical selection criteria to identify 386 candidates .    an obvious way to confirm if these optical surveys are successful in finding true bl  lac objects",
    "is to exploit another of the defining features of this agn class ; namely , their high optical polarization . in this paper",
    ", we present optical polarimetry of more than 40 bl  lac candidates from the sdss sample .",
    "these measurements are a direct test of the synchrotron nature assumed to be responsible for the observed featureless continuum .",
    "they also provide a basis for comparison with the polarization properties of x - ray and radio - selected bl  lac objects and offer an interesting new sample for follow - up observations in other spectral regions .",
    "objects were chosen for the optical polarization survey from the sample of bl  lac candidates derived from the sdss by c05 .",
    "candidate selection by c05 is based on optical properties , most notably a nearly featureless spectrum combined with proper motion and broad - band color criteria to minimize galactic contamination by objects like dc white dwarfs .",
    "the sample s 386 members are separated into `` probable '' and `` possible '' bl  lac object categories by c05 depending on the likelihood that a candidate is actually a galactic star . forty - two of 156 probable bl  lac candidates that are not already classified in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) as bl  lac objects were measured for optical polarization . although most of the objects in the c05 sample that are already identified in ned have not been observed for polarization , we exclude these objects from this study to mitigate biases caused by the spectroscopic target selection criteria used for the sdss ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , 55 bl  lac candidates were originally targeted for spectroscopy because they have counterparts detected by the faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ( first ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the selection of these bl  lac candidates by c05 is obviously influenced by the fact that spectra were obtained because of non - optical properties . by ignoring the candidates previously identified in ned ,",
    "all of the objects found by other search techniques are excluded from the polarization survey .",
    "this criterion yields a sample completely independent of past bl  lac object searches , but biases the polarization sample by selecting against the objects with the strongest radio and/or x - ray fluxes that can also be found in an unbiased optical survey . in this case , 29 of 240 probable bl  lac candidates were excluded from the polarization survey even though they were chosen for sdss spectroscopy based solely on their optical properties .",
    "the polarization survey targets are listed in table  1 along with their galactic latitude ( @xmath3 ) , sdss @xmath4-band magnitude , estimated galactic @xmath4-band extinction ( @xmath5 ) , and extinction - corrected optical spectral index , @xmath6 , as listed or derived from the sdss database ( c05 ) .",
    "observations were made during 2005 may and 2006 october using the steward observatory 2.3  m bok telescope on kitt peak , az and the spol spectropolarimeter @xcite .",
    "most objects were observed with spol in its imaging polarimetry configuration ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in this mode",

    "the ccd pixel size is 15  @xmath9 m ( @xmath10 on the sky ) .",
    "the 2005 observations used a kpno `` nearly mould '' @xmath11 filter ( 60007000   ) . a combination of hoya ha-30 and y-48 filters was selected for the imaging polarimetry in 2006 october to permit a broader spectral response of @xmath148007000   .",
    "a @xmath12 circular aperture was used in the reductions to determine the normalized linear polarization stokes parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting degree of polarization ( @xmath15 ) and polarization position angle ( @xmath16 ) are given in table  1 .",
    "unless otherwise noted , @xmath15 has been corrected for statistical bias @xcite , although this correction is very small for most objects because of the generally high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the measurements ( the median @xmath17% ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry was acquired for five of the brighter sdss targets in the sample on ut 2006 october  27 .",
    "the instrumental configuration and data reduction are similar to those described in @xcite .",
    "a slit width of @xmath18 was employed along with spectral extraction apertures of @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the listed measurements of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in table  1 for these objects are derived from averaging @xmath13 and @xmath14 over the 50007000    spectral range ( 500 pixels ) .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath16 show no significant variation with wavelength across the entire spectrum for these objects .",
    "we consider an object to be highly polarized if @xmath0% , in keeping with past surveys of agn ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this criterion has been effective at discriminating between sources with synchrotron emission - dominated optical continua and those without . also , this level of polarization is generally sufficient to rule out a significant galactic interstellar polarization ( isp )",
    "contribution to the observed polarized flux for objects that are more than @xmath120@xmath21  away from the galactic plane .",
    "indeed , the small estimated values of @xmath5 for the sdss sample imply that @xmath22% for the candidates , even allowing for the empirically determined maximum isp for a given extinction , @xmath23(@xmath24 ) = 3.27@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "polarimetry of objects included within the fields of several bl  lac candidates support the claim that isp is not significant . for field objects bright enough to yield polarization measurements of high quality ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26% , only those in the fields of sdss j083943.36 + 354001.5 ( sdss  j0839 + 3540 ; hereafter the iau designation for objects is shortened to sdss  j_hhmm_@xmath27_ddmm _ ) and sdss  j2248@xmath280036 show evidence for @xmath29 approaching 2% .",
    "this high level of isp is dwarfed by the measured polarization of sdss  j0839 + 3540 .",
    "in contrast , inclusion of the isp along the sight line to sdss  j2248@xmath280036 does not increase its polarization over the @xmath0% threshold .",
    "twenty - four of the 42 objects observed show optical polarization above 3% , verifying that a large number of candidates in the sdss sample are indeed bl  lac objects .",
    "the highest observed polarization is 22.6@xmath270.1% and there are 10 objects with @xmath30% .",
    "this result proves that the approach used by c05 to identify bl  lac objects based primarily on their optical spectra is generally effective at finding new members of this class of agn . beyond the basic",
    "finding that the sdss sample is highly polarized , the distribution of polarization within the sample can be examined in various ways and the results of this analysis are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the sample can be split into two groups depending on the nature of the sdss spectra .",
    "there are 15 objects in the polarization survey whose redshifts can not be determined from the identification of host galaxy absorption features .",
    "these objects constitute the portion of the sample that shows the highest polarization . all 10 objects with",
    "@xmath30% have undetermined redshifts .",
    "this pronounced selection effect is likely to be caused by the fact that a featureless synchrotron continuum completely dominates the optical spectra of these objects .",
    "any spectral features from the galaxy host are washed out at the s / n level of the available spectroscopy , much like they are for a large fraction of radio - selected bl  lac objects that also generally show high polarization ( see  4 ) .",
    "only two of 15 objects with unknown @xmath31 fall into the low - polarization category .",
    "this is in marked contrast to those sdss bl  lac candidates with measured redshifts .",
    "more than half of the latter objects ( 16/27 ) are not observed to be highly polarized , and there are no objects with @xmath30% .",
    "some of the discrepancy in the overall polarization levels between objects with redshifts and those without is caused by a larger contribution of the host galaxy to the optical flux , at least for those objects with @xmath32 .",
    "the dilution of synchrotron light by unpolarized starlight decreases the observed polarization and this effect can be seen in the imaging polarimetry for several sdss objects .",
    "nine objects included in the polarization survey are classified as resolved by c05 from the sdss images .",
    "five of these meet the criterion for high polarization , but the maximum polarization observed for this group in a 6@xmath33 aperture is @xmath34% .",
    "figure  1 displays the polarization as a function of observing aperture for eight objects with host galaxies that are prominent enough to be identified in the sdss and easily seen in the polarimetry images . for five objects ,",
    "a clear trend with @xmath15 decreasing with increasing aperture is apparent .",
    "a similar analysis for highly polarized objects classified as point sources by c05 reveals typical variations in polarization with aperture of @xmath350.05@xmath15 .",
    "the trend displayed in figure  1 is in the expected sense , because the measured polarization declines as more unpolarized starlight is included within the aperture .",
    "the effect is most pronounced for sdss  j2248@xmath280036 , however the nearly factor of 2 increase in @xmath15 between a 6@xmath36 and 2@xmath36 aperture is not enough for this candidate to meet the high - polarization criterion . likewise , correcting for host galaxy starlight does not elevate the high - polarization resolved bl  lac objects into the range of @xmath30% that is populated exclusively by objects with unknown redshifts .",
    "note that galactic isp can be ruled out as the sole polarizing mechanism for low - polarization objects like sdss  j2248@xmath280036 because @xmath15 would be constant with aperture .",
    "the sample of objects with measured @xmath31 can be further subdivided into @xmath32 ( 18 objects ) and @xmath37 ( 9 objects ) groups . again",
    ", there is a large difference in the distribution of polarization between these two groupings .",
    "high polarization is not observed in any of the high - redshift objects .",
    "in fact , all of these objects are measured to have @xmath38% ( see  4 ) .",
    "the 11 highly polarized objects are found at @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite identify 27 objects from their list of probable bl  lac candidates as being potentially radio - quiet .",
    "ten of these objects were observed for polarization .",
    "since this group consists mostly of objects with @xmath37 ( 8 of 10 objects ) , the overall levels of polarization measured are similar to the high - redshift sample .",
    "that is , no objects were observed to be highly polarized .",
    "in addition , only upper limits could be placed on @xmath15 for two objects with unknown redshifts included in this group : sdss  j0201 + 0025 and sdss  j1048 + 6203 .",
    "the 1-sigma upper limit on @xmath15 for sdss  j0201 + 0025 is @xmath15% , so further polarimetry is required to definitively determine if it is highly polarized .",
    "finally , high polarization in the sdss sample appears to be related to the shape of the optical continuum as well as to whether discrete spectral features are detected . for the entire polarization sample",
    ", we have corrected the sdss @xmath40 photometry for interstellar extinction and fit a power law to the resulting broad - band flux densities .",
    "this is a crude approximation since a power law will not yield an acceptable fit if the host galaxy is an important source of flux .",
    "also , fitting a power law over the entire optical spectrum will not be adequate for high-@xmath31 objects as the lyman  @xmath41 forest and lyman limit invade various filter bandpasses .    with these limitations in mind",
    ", we have calculated a spectral index , @xmath6 , where @xmath42 .",
    "the indices are listed in table  1 , and in the left panel of figure  2 @xmath15 is plotted against @xmath6 for all of the sdss objects in the survey .",
    "high - polarization objects are peaked strongly around @xmath43 .",
    "all but three highly polarized objects fall within the range @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , objects with @xmath37 span nearly the entire spectral index range , yet none are highly polarized .    in the right panel of figure  2 , @xmath15 is plotted against the `` goodness of fit '' of a power law to the broad - band spectrum as measured by the reduced @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "higher polarization tends to be observed more often if the optical continuum is reasonably well fit by a simple power law .",
    "a single power law is a poor fit to the continua of most of the high - redshift objects mostly owing to the lyman  @xmath41 forest and lyman limit spectral features reducing flux in the blue bandpasses , and this is reflected in the very large @xmath46 for these objects .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is listed for each object in table  1 .",
    "the results of a polarization survey of 42 optically - selected bl  lac candidates from the sdss show that a majority of objects ( 24 ) are highly polarized and that their classification as bl  lac objects is confirmed .",
    "the strategy employed by c05 of selecting quasi - featureless spectra from a deep optical survey such as the sdss and investigating proper motion and broad - band color properties to minimize contamination by featureless galactic objects is largely validated by optical polarimetry .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the sdss and 2qz survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can provide a much deeper census of the bl  lac object population than currently available x - ray and radio surveys that until now have been the most effective ways of finding these agn .",
    "the polarimetric verification of the sdss sample is an important step in showing that a purely optical search can be at least as efficient in this regard as surveys at x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "there is , however , a relatively small subgroup within the probable bl  lac candidate list of c05 that is not polarimetrically confirmed .",
    "namely , objects with redshifts @xmath471 selected from the sdss and objects that are necessarily much weaker radio sources than known bl  lac objects , given their optical brightness , have fundamentally different polarization properties from the rest of the sample .",
    "all of these objects are measured to have very low polarizations .",
    "bl  lac objects are not highly polarized all of the time , but to have none of the nine @xmath37 candidates polarized @xmath48% in a synoptic survey seriously challenges their classification as bl  lac objects . among even the relatively optically sedate x - ray - selected bl  lac objects ,",
    "roughly 4 out of 10 will exhibit @xmath49% in a single - epoch survey @xcite .",
    "if the continua of the sdss high-@xmath31 candidates are dominated by synchrotron emission , then the magnetic fields within the emitting regions must be unusually chaotic .",
    "it might be argued that the discrepancy between the general polarization levels of high-@xmath31 objects and the rest of the sample is caused by the dilution of the synchrotron light by an unpolarized continuum source that dominates the flux in the ultraviolet .",
    "a possible candidate is the big blue bump ( bbb ) that dominates the uv - optical continuum of most strong broad emission - line agn ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of the bbb ( plus the smaller ",
    "3000    bump  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the synchrotron polarization spectrum has been demonstrated for several optically violent variable quasars and 3c  273 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in all of these cases , @xmath15 decreases into the blue as the bbb becomes increasingly more important relative to the redder synchrotron spectrum .",
    "bl  lac objects , however , show neither this necessary polarimetric signature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , nor the spectral flattening required if the bbb is an important contributor to the uv flux @xcite . in this regard , none of the candidates show any indication of their spectra flattening into the blue from the sdss data , and the spectropolarimetry available for six of the sdss objects is completely consistent with past studies of bl  lac objects by showing no evidence for dilution by the bbb .",
    "possibly the most dramatic evidence that the blue bump ( or any other plausible diluting component ) is , in general , not a significant source of ultraviolet flux in bl  lac objects is provided by simultaneous uv / optical polarimetry .",
    "these observations reveal that @xmath15 is as high , or even higher in the uv than at optical wavelengths down to a rest - frame wavelength of 1400    @xcite .",
    "roughly the same rest - frame spectral region is sampled by these past uv measurements as in the imaging polarimetry of the high-@xmath31 bl  lac candidates .",
    "the sdss objects , therefore , must be quite different from known bl  lac objects if dilution of the synchrotron light is responsible for the very low observed polarizations",
    ". the small number of high - redshift objects included in the sdss sample may be lower-@xmath31 analogs to sdss j153259.96@xmath28003944.1 @xcite , a @xmath50 object that defies easy classification within any of the traditional agn families . like the @xmath37 objects observed for this study , sdss  j1532@xmath280039 does not exhibit emission lines , and @xcite measured its polarization to be @xmath51% .",
    "further observations will be necessary to determine whether these objects constitute a new class of extragalactic object , fundamentally different from other high-@xmath31 emission - line agn , or are indeed bl  lac objects requiring that the traditional definition for this class be radically modified ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a small number of probable bl  lac candidates are identified by c05 that could be weaker radio sources than previously seen within this class of agn .",
    "many of the 27 potential `` radio - quiet '' candidates are also members of the @xmath37 group of objects discussed above .",
    "polarimetry of 10 potentially radio - weak bl  lac objects yields no evidence that these objects are strongly polarized .",
    "this result suggests that the sdss has not uncovered a population of truly radio - quiet bl  lac objects , consistent with earlier findings from x - ray - selected samples @xcite .      disregarding the potentially radio - weak objects , which comprise @xmath5212% of the total number of probable candidates , cross - correlation of the sdss bl  lac candidates with available x - ray and radio catalogs by c05 reveals that the sample is consistent with the x - ray ",
    "radio spectral energy distributions of previously known bl  lac objects .",
    "likewise , our polarimetry survey shows that the levels of optical polarization observed for the sdss sample are consistent with those found in other bl  lac object samples . in figure  3 ,",
    "the polarization of the sdss sample is compared to an x - ray - selected and a radio - selected sample of bl  lac objects .",
    "thirty - seven bl  lac objects observed by @xcite were chosen for the x - ray - selected comparison sample .",
    "these objects were drawn from the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from the _ heao  1 _ a-2 survey @xcite .",
    "since @xcite monitored the optical flux and polarization of this sample over a period of @xmath13 years , the first polarization measurement of each object was used for comparison to the single - epoch survey of the sdss bl  lac objects .",
    "many of these first measurements only set upper limits on @xmath15 , and therefore , the distribution of polarization for the x - ray - selected bl  lac objects in figure  3 is likely to be biased toward higher values at low @xmath15 simply because we treat the upper limits as true detections to avoid potentially larger biases that would occur by comparing a synoptic survey with a true monitoring program .",
    "the radio - selected sample is drawn from the 5  ghz 1  jansky catalog ( 1  jy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consists of 34 bl  lac objects .",
    "many of these objects have been optically observed for nearly four decades and the polarization distribution displayed in figure  3 is constructed from `` first observations '' from various sources @xcite .",
    "the pronounced difference in the polarization distributions between x - ray and radio - selected bl  lac objects , first described by @xcite , is clearly apparent in figure  3 .",
    "nearly all ( @xmath53% ) of the radio - selected objects have @xmath0% , whereas such levels of polarization are measured in only about half of the x - ray sample .",
    "additionally , no x - ray bl  lac object was observed to have @xmath30% , though 5 of the 37 objects exhibited @xmath54% at some point during the 3-year long monitoring program @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath150% of the 1  jy bl  lac objects will , on average , have @xmath30% at any given epoch .",
    "we also plot two probability curves for the sdss candidate bl  lac objects in figure  3 .",
    "one curve represents the entire polarization survey sample of 42 objects , while the other omits the @xmath37 objects as well as sdss  j0201 + 0025 and sdss  j1048 + 6203 since their classification as true bl  lac objects is questionable as discussed in  4.1 .",
    "the two curves , therefore , represent the extremes for the cumulative distribution of optical polarization for the portion of the sdss spectroscopic sample not previously identified as bl  lac objects in ned ( see  2 ) . the fraction of sdss objects that exhibit @xmath0% is intermediate between the x - ray and radio samples whether or not the suspect low - polarization candidates are included .",
    "also , the fraction of low - polarization objects in the full sdss sample is roughly similar to the fraction seen among the x - ray - selected sample .",
    "the `` edited ''",
    "sdss sample provides a closer match in redshift with the x - ray sample , but a more definitive comparison between the low - polarization tails of the sdss and x - ray distributions requires better matching of the measurement uncertainties .",
    "typical values for @xmath55 for the polarimetry of the emss and @xmath56 a-2 bl  lac objects @xcite are factors of 24@xmath57 larger than those estimated from the imaging polarimetry of the sdss targets .",
    "optical polarimetry of 42 of 240 probable bl  lac candidates spectroscopically selected from the sdss verifies that this survey identifies true bl  lac objects , with over half of the measured objects showing @xmath0% .",
    "the level of polarization is seen to be related to the properties of the observed optical spectrum .",
    "the highest polarization tends to be observed in objects whose host galaxy features are undetected and have undetermined redshifts at the s / n of the sdss spectroscopy .",
    "high optical polarization also tends to be observed for objects with @xmath58 and continua that are reasonably well approximated by a single power law .",
    "furthermore , the general polarization levels observed for the sdss sample are intermediate between the levels found for previously studied x - ray and radio - selected bl  lac objects .",
    "the polarization survey does not confirm that any of the handful of potentially radio - weak candidates are , in fact , bl  lac objects .",
    "the success of the sdss in finding an optically - selected sample of bl  lac objects is a major advance in determining an accurate census of this rare class of agn , at least for @xmath59 .",
    "still to be determined is whether the sdss has identified bl  lac objects at @xmath37 , or has , alternatively , found members of a new class of high - redshift agn devoid of emission lines , but also not showing the usual properties associated with a synchrotron continuum .",
    "near - infrared observations that measure the rest - frame optical polarization of these objects can definitively determine if a highly polarized synchrotron spectrum is being diluted by unpolarized uv flux that is not detected in low - redshift bl  lac objects .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to verify the existence of such a strong , presumably non - relativistically beamed , ultraviolet continuum source , especially since it does not power a rich emission - line spectrum .",
    "variability studies may also hold some clues as to the nature of the high-@xmath31 objects .",
    "indeed , strong variability , both in flux and polarization , in all wavelength bands is a defining property of bl  lac objects and the investigation of this aspect is important for understanding the full range of behavior of the sdss bl  lac objects . in particular ,",
    "a central question is whether optically - selected bl  lac objects will show variability behavior consistent with the wildly variable radio - selected sources , the more mildly variable x - ray - selected objects , or be intermediate to these extreme examples as suggested by their measured polarization levels . in this",
    "regard , future studies utilizing data from projects like the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) are likely to provide the most definitive examination of the optical flux variability of bl  lac objects and other types of agn .",
