    "first passage percolation was introduced by hammersley and welsh in @xcite and can be viewed as a model for the spread of an infecion on a graph structure .",
    "the term infection can have different meanings depending on the context , and may refer e.g.  to a fluid spreading through a porous medium , information transfer or a virus spreading in a structured population .",
    "the original and most studied case is when the underlying graph is the @xmath3 lattice .",
    "here we restrict to @xmath4 , and investigate the speed and shape of the growing infected set by aid of computer simulations .",
    "the theoretical results involve quantities that have turned out to be very difficult to characterize analytically and simulation studies may therefore be of interest to shed light on qualitative behavior and as guidelines for further theoretical investigations .",
    "the total cpu time for our simulations amounts to more than 19 years , which make them the most extensive ones so far for the model .    to specify the model ,",
    "let @xmath0 denote the set of integer points in the plane and write @xmath5 for the set of neareast neighbor edges of @xmath0 .",
    "each edge @xmath6 is equipped with a non - negative random variable @xmath7 interpreted as the time it takes for the infection to traverse the edge @xmath8 .",
    "a path is a sequence of connected edges @xmath9 and the passage time for a path @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 the passage time from a set @xmath12 to a set @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 when @xmath15 and @xmath16 consist of single sites , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we write @xmath19 .",
    "the interest revolves around dynamics and asymptotics for the growth of the infection , starting at time 0 with the origin infected and all other sites of @xmath0 uninfected . in order to be able to analyze this",
    ", one has to make some assumptions on the joint distribution of the set of edge passage times @xmath20 .",
    "usually , the passage times are assumed to be i.i.d . , but some results requiring only stationarity also appear in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "here we shall throughout assume that the passage times are i.i.d .  with common distribution function @xmath21 .",
    "existing results basically fall in three categories : ( i ) results on the growth in a fixed direction , ( ii ) results concerning the growth of the whole set of infected sites , and ( iii ) results on properties of infinite time - minimizing paths ( geodesics ) .",
    "our purpose here is to explore results of type ( i ) and ( ii ) by aid of simulations .",
    "we will not be concerned with results in category ( iii ) , but refer e.g.  to @xcite for early work and conjectures , and to @xcite for more recent results and proofs of some of the conjectures .",
    "we also remark that such results are related to properties of growth processes involving several competing infection types ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "to characterize the growth in a fixed direction , first note that the passage times defined above are subadditive in the sense that @xmath22 writing @xmath23 , this means that , under sufficient moment conditions on the distribution @xmath21 of the edge passage times , the family @xmath24 fulfills the conditions of liggett s version @xcite of kingman s subadditive ergodic theorem @xcite , which asserts roughly that @xmath25 grows linearly in @xmath26 as @xmath27 . in order for the theorem to be applicable",

    ", it is shown that @xmath35 if and only if @xmath36 hence the infection grows linearly in time when @xmath37 and faster than linearly when @xmath38 .",
    "we remark that in dimensions @xmath39 , the bound 1/2 is replaced by the critical value of standard bond percolation on @xmath3 .",
    "a fundamental problem in first passage percolation is to determine the time constant @xmath33 and its relation to the edge passage time distribution @xmath21 .",
    "this has turned out to be a difficult task : the value of @xmath33 is so far not known for any non - degenerate distribution @xmath21 .",
    "existing results and bounds are quite weak and are described in section 2 .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to investigate by simulations how @xmath33 is related to various characteristics of @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to studying asymptotics for passage times along the axes , it is of course also of interest to study passage times in other directions . for @xmath40 ,",
    "we interpret @xmath41 as the time when the closest point of @xmath42 in @xmath0 is infected . with @xmath43",
    ", the subadditivity arguments outlined above can then be adapted to establish the existence of a directional time constant @xmath44 such that @xmath45 a.s .",
    "( some extra work is required for @xmath42 with non - rational coordinates ) . here , @xmath46 , where @xmath33 is the time constant along the axes .",
    "an interesting question is of course if and how @xmath44 changes as the direction of @xmath47 varies .",
    "this is closely related to the nature of the asymptotic shape of the infected set , which is our next topic .",
    "we now proceed to study the growth of the whole infected set . to this end , write @xmath48 , let @xmath49 denote a unit cube centered at @xmath40 and define @xmath50 .",
    "the main result is a shape theorem , which asserts that @xmath51 converges almost surely to a deterministic shape @xmath15 .",
    "the following version is due to cox and durrett @xcite .",
    "kesten @xcite has proved that the conclusion is true also in dimension @xmath39 under stronger moment conditions .",

    "the last statement implies that ( [ eq : shape_cond ] ) is a necessary condition for the linear growth of @xmath60 , since otherwise the infected region will have uninfected points in its interior that are visible on a linear scale .",
    "we refer to section [ sim_shape ] for pictures illustrating this .",

    ".  we will be interested in the case when @xmath37 and ( [ eq : shape_cond ] ) holds , so that the growth is linear and the scaled infected set converges to a compact shape @xmath15 .",
    "apart from the symmetries inherited from the @xmath0 lattice , not much is known about @xmath15 , and the difficulties with characterizing @xmath15 analytically basically stem from lattice effects caused by @xmath0 .",
    "we will instead study @xmath15 by aid of simulations .",
    "questions that we will try to answer include : _ how does the shape deviate from a circle ?",
    "how is it affected by the passage time distribution ?",
    "what about the fluctuations of the shape around its mean ?",
    "_    the rest of the paper is organized so that section 2 contains a survey of known results on the time constant and the asymptotic shape , in section 3 the results of the simulations are described and section 4 contains conclusions and directions for further work .",
    "we begin with a short survey of known results that are relevant to our studies .",
    "we also define the quantities that will be investigated and describe the aims of the simulations in more detail .",
    "the material is organized in two sections , one on growth in a fixed direction and one on the asymptotic shape .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the time constant @xmath33 has turned out to be difficult to determine . as for rigorous bounds , it follows from the characterization ( [ eq : mu_def ] ) that @xmath62 $ ] , and in @xcite it is shown that this inequality is strict for all non - degenerate distributions @xmath21 .",
    "methods for computing better rigorous upper bounds can be found in @xcite , and lower bounds are derived in @xcite .",
    "both the upper and the lower bounds in general require computer assistance for obtaining numerical values .",
    "the precision varies with the distribution @xmath21 , but the bounds tend to be quite crude .",
    "for instance , the methods in @xcite give @xmath63 for exp(1 ) passage times and @xmath64 for @xmath65 passage times , while the estimates ( from computer simulations ) given in @xcite are 0.402 and 0.312 , respectively .",
    "write @xmath66 for the time constant associated with the edge passage time distribution @xmath21 .",
    "an interesting question is how @xmath66 behaves as a functional of @xmath21 .",
    "cox and kesten @xcite show that @xmath66 is continuous in @xmath21 in the sense that , if @xmath67 converges weakly to @xmath21 , then @xmath68 .",
    "another natural property , confirmed in @xcite , is that , if @xmath69 for all @xmath70 , then @xmath71 in @xcite , it is shown that ( [ eq : mu_ineq ] ) holds also under the weaker assumption that @xmath72 for every concave increasing function @xmath73 for which the above integrals are absolutely convergent . if this holds , then @xmath74 is said to be more variable than @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath74 is more variable than @xmath21 and @xmath75 , then @xmath74 is said to be strictly more variable than @xmath21 .",
    "the main result in @xcite is that the inequality in ( [ eq : mu_ineq ] ) is strict if @xmath74 is strictly more variable than @xmath21 and if ( [ eq : mu_pos ] ) holds ( an additional assumption for distributions with inf supp@xmath76 was later removed in @xcite , where supp(@xmath21 ) denotes the support of @xmath21 ) .    one way of transforming a given distribution into a strictly more variable one is by pushing mass away from some point @xmath77 ; for further details see the criterion by karlin and novikoff in @xcite .",
    "a simple example is when @xmath21 is uniform on @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath74 is uniform on @xmath79 $ ] for @xmath80 .",
    "this example demonstrates that two distributions with the same mean do not necessarily give rise to the same time constant . for the particular case of uniform distributions centered at a given mean",
    ", the time constant is instead strictly decreasing as the variance increases .",
    "an interesting question is of course what properties of @xmath21 that are important in determining @xmath66 in general .",
    "this largely remains unknown , and is one of the questions that we will investigate here .",
    "_ is it true in general that , for distributions with the same mean , the time constant is decreasing in the variance ?",
    "can we find another quantity than the mean that determines the time constant ? _",
    "we continue by exploring passage times to lines rather than to single points . to this end , write @xmath81 for the vertical line that crosses the @xmath42-axis at @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out that the passage time @xmath83 to the line @xmath81 behaves asymptotically the same as @xmath25 , that is , @xmath84 a first proof of this appeared in @xcite , but it can also be derived from the asymptotic shape result , stated below as theorem [ th : shape ] ; see @xcite .",
    "the observation that @xmath33 appears also as the limit of the scaled passage times to the line @xmath81 has advantages when estimating @xmath33 by aid of simulations : the passage time of the infection to the single point @xmath82 may be substantially increased if all edges incident to @xmath82 happen to have very large passage times , and keeping track of the whole growth process during this time requires a lot of computer power .",
    "this problem arises in particular for heavy - tailed edge passage time distributions @xmath21 , but is avoided by working with passage times to lines rather than points .    to define passage times to lines in an arbitrary direction , fix an angle",
    "@xmath85 $ ] and write @xmath86 . furthermore , let @xmath87 , that is , @xmath88 is the part of @xmath61 to the right of the line that is orthogonal to the line @xmath89 and intersects this line at distance @xmath26 from the origin ; see figure [ fig : omega ] . assuming ( [ eq : minfin ] ) , it follows from subadditivity that @xmath90 where @xmath91}{n}.\\ ] ] here @xmath92 is the time constant in the direction @xmath93 based on passage times to lines . the arguments for @xmath94 ( referred to above ) can easily be adapted to show that the constant coincides with the one based on passage times to points , that is , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .    clearly @xmath97 , where @xmath33 is the time constant along the axes , described above .",
    "an interesting question is of course if and how @xmath92 changes as @xmath93 increases .",
    "however , just as for @xmath94 , obtaining information about @xmath92 for @xmath98 is difficult .",
    "the methods in @xcite for calculating rigorous bounds are applicable in any direction , but there is no systematic study on how the resulting bounds depend on the direction : as mentioned above , the bounds tend to be quite crude and this means that they will most likely not allow for rigorous conclusions on how @xmath92 changes with @xmath93 . we will instead study this by aid of simulations .",
    "the behavior of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath93 is closely related to the nature of the asymptotic shape of the infected set , which is our next topic .",
    "recall that @xmath99 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath100 is a norm on @xmath61 when @xmath37 , and the shape @xmath15 is the unit ball in this norm , that is , @xmath101 .",
    "clearly @xmath15 inherits all symmetries of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that @xmath15 is convex ( which follows from subadditivity ) implies that its boundary must fall somewhere between the diamond @xmath102 and the cube with side @xmath103 centered at the origin .",
    "constant passage times give the diamond as asymptotic shape , but characterizing @xmath15 for non - trivial distributions has turned out to be very difficult .",
    "early simulations for exponentially distributed passage times indicated that @xmath15 was a circle ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "kesten @xcite however shows that , for a certain class of distributions including the exponential , @xmath15 is not a ball in sufficiently high dimension ( where  sufficiently high  means @xmath104 for the exponential distribution ) , and this of course speaks against a circle in two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , due to the underlying lattice structure there is no theoretical basis for a rotationally invariant shape .    in @xcite",
    "it is shown that @xmath15 has a flat edge ( that is , its boundary contains a straight line segment ) when @xmath21 is a shifted geometric distribution with @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 sufficiently close to 1 .",
    "marchand @xcite generalizes this by showing that any distribution @xmath21 with inf supp@xmath108 and @xmath109 gives rise to a flat edge , where @xmath110 denotes the critical value for directed bond percolation on @xmath0 .",
    "it is believed that @xmath15 is strictly convex ( and hence does not have flat edges ) as soon as @xmath111 but so far strict convexity has not been proved for any distribution . in @xcite",
    "however , distributions ( with atoms ) are constructed that give non - polygonal shapes , that is , shapes where the boundary does not consist only of flat edges .    as for comparing shapes for different distributions ,",
    "the fact that @xmath112 when @xmath74 is more variable than @xmath21 can be generalized to any direction for distributions with inf supp@xmath113=0 .",
    "this means that the asymptotic shape for @xmath21 is then strictly smaller than for @xmath74 .",
    "when inf supp@xmath108 , the shape contains flat edges if @xmath114 is large , as mentioned above .",
    "if in this case also inf supp@xmath115 , then the shapes coincide along the flat edges , but otherwise and in other directions the shape for @xmath74 is strictly larger than the shape for @xmath21 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "we will investigate the growing shape from a number of different aspects : for constant passage times , the time constant @xmath92 increases with @xmath93 so that the shape is smallest along the diagonals .",
    "_ is this true in general ?",
    "how does the shape depend on properties of the passage time distribution ?",
    "can we quantify the deviations from a circle ?",
    "_    the asymptotic shape of first passage percolation has received attention also in statistical physics . there",
    "the focus has been on the fluctuations of @xmath116 around its mean shape .",
    "first passage percolation is conjectured to belong to a class of growth models analyzed by kardar , parisi and zhang in @xcite .",
    "this means that the fluctuations of the interface between @xmath116 and its complement is believed to be of the order @xmath117 with @xmath118 , so that hence var@xmath119 is of the order @xmath120 .",
    "the analysis also involves an exponent @xmath77 such that the fluctuations of the location where @xmath116 hits a line at distance @xmath121 from the origin is of the order @xmath122 .",
    "heuristical arguments suggest that the exponents @xmath123 and @xmath77 are related in that @xmath124 , which implies that @xmath125 . both exponents are believed to be independent of the direction and of the passage time distribution @xmath21 .",
    "our simulations give support for this , and the predicted values of the exponents ( see also references below to earlier simulations ) .",
    "rigorous results related to the above conjectures concern var@xmath119 but are quite weak . in @xcite , it is shown that , if @xmath21 has finite second moment , then @xmath126 . as for upper bounds , the best bound to date is var@xmath127 , which is proved for uniform distributions in @xcite and for a larger class of ( non - atomic ) distributions in @xcite .",
    "as for lower bounds , the best result is that var@xmath119 is at least of the order @xmath128 for distributions @xmath21 that satisfy ( [ eq : f_conv_cond ] ) ; see @xcite .",
    "previous simulation studies on first passage percolation are limited , both in number and in scope .",
    "the early references @xcite have already been mentioned . there the shape is simulated for exponentially distributed passage times and is seen to be reminiscent of a circle .",
    "these simulations however were substantially restricted by limitations in computer power . in the theoretical physics literature ,",
    "the so called eden growth model @xcite has received a lot of attention and one version of the model is equivalent to first passage percolation with exponential passage times .",
    "the interest mainly revolves around the scaling properties of the boundary of the growing infected set , see e.g.  @xcite , and the model has also been subject to simulation studies from this aspect .",
    "the results confirm the conjecture for the exponents @xmath123 and @xmath77 described above ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the simulations are not performed on the version of the model that is equivalent to first passage percolation , but the different versions are closely related and all belong to the universality class defined in @xcite , so the conclusions are still relevant in this context .",
    "our simulations are designed so that , in each run , we keep track of the infected set until all lines at distance @xmath129 from the origin have been hit . here",
    "@xmath130 varies between 10.000 and 20.000 depending on the distribution of the passage times , see table [ tab_summary ] .",
    "we record all hitting times to lines in five symmetry directions , including the axis and the diagonal , and , for each such direction , we calculate average hitting times over all symmetries ( the averages are hence based on four values in the axis direction and along the diagonal , and on eight values for the other directions ) .",
    "the directions in between the axis and the diagonal are , in the first octant , defined by the lines @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for increasing values of @xmath134 , and the corresponding directional angles with the @xmath42-axis are approximately 14 , 27 and 37 degrees , respectively .",
    "the lines run through integer points , which makes it slightly easier to record the hitting times .",
    "we also keep track of the hitting points on the lines .",
    "the simulations are performed on a cluster of 28 linux machines , each with 12 kernels , running at 2 ghz .",
    "we study several different continuous passage time distributions .",
    "note that all distributions are scalable in the sense that multiplication by a constant ( which allows us to tune e.g.  the mean ) gives rise to a distribution in the same distribution class .    * the exponential distribution with mean 1 . because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution , the simulations here are much faster than for other distributions and are therefore more extensive . for comparison , we mention that one simulation with @xmath135 takes 22 minutes for the exponential distribution and 37 hours for the uniform distribution on [ 0,1 ]  the times hence differ roughly by a factor 100 . * gamma distributions , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 .",
    "the mean value is 1 for all @xmath138 , but the variance decreases as @xmath138 increases .",

    "table [ tab_summary ] contains the values of these quantities along with the mean and the variance of the distributions and a summary of the scope of the performed simulations .",

    ".summary of simulated passage time distributions . [ cols=\"<,^,>,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our findings indicate that the time constant is closely related to the quantity @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "a gamma distribution and a fisher distribution have very different properties and therefore it seems reasonable to believe that the above approximate relation between the time constant and @xmath146 $ ] is valid for a quite large class of distributions , e.g.  absolutely continuous distributions @xmath21 with inf supp@xmath148 that are not too concentrated . if the distribution is very concentrated , e.g.  with mass @xmath149 on the interval @xmath150 $ ] for some @xmath151 and the rest of the mass smeared out over the positive axis , then the time constant and @xmath146 $ ] will both be close to @xmath152 and their ratio close to 1 ( rather than 1.5 ) so it is clear that the relation is not completely universal .",
    "figure [ fig : tc_e4_spik ] is analogous to figure [ fig : tc_e4 ] ( with u(0.1,0.9 ) excluded ) , but we have included estimates also for @xmath153 and @xmath154 based on smaller simulations ( 500 runs with @xmath155 ) .",
    "these distributions have variance @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively , and we note that , for @xmath94 , their values indeed fall below a line fitted to the other distributions while , for @xmath158 , they still comply quite well with the other distributions ( see below for some further comments on this ) . as for theoretical bounds , we believe that @xmath159 $ ] is true in great generality  perhaps as soon as @xmath37 so that @xmath35 , and most likely when @xmath160  but we do not have a proof of this .",
    "figure [ fig : tc_e4 ] revealed that u(0.1,0.9 ) deviates slightly from the pattern for the distributions with inf supp@xmath148 .",
    "what happens in general to the time constant when the support of the distribution is bounded away from 0 ? in order to investigate this , we have performed additional simulations for translated versions of our distributions , more specifically , we have simulated passage times distributed as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 and @xmath163 has one the the distributions in table [ tab_summary ] ( excluding u(0.1,0.9 ) ) .",
    "these simulations are smaller and consist of 100 runs to @xmath155 for each translated distribution .",
    "plotting the time constants against @xmath146 $ ] indicates that the relation becomes ( i ) less linear when @xmath164 increases for a given angle @xmath93 and ( ii ) more linear when @xmath93 increases for a given value of @xmath164 .",
    "this is illustrated with pictures for @xmath94 and @xmath158 in figure [ fig : tc_e4_05 ] ( @xmath165 ) and figure [ fig : tc_e4_4 ] ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the fact that very concentrated distributions and translated distributions deviate from the pattern observed for more spread out distributions with inf supp@xmath148 may be explained in that , in both these cases , the model is regularized , meaning roughly that it contains less randomness relative to the average passage time .",
    "thereby it comes closer to the situation with constant passage time . in both cases , there will be a tendency that the shortest paths are also the fastest , so that there is a stronger tendency for the infection to hit a point via the neighbor on the shortest path .",
    "using @xmath146 $ ] as an explaining factor however is based on the assumption that the infection may invade a point via any of its four neighbors .",
    "the regularizing effect is most evident along the axis , where there is a unique shortest path , while it takes longer to set in along the diagonal , where there are more paths of optimal length . quantifying what happens in the transition from the regime where @xmath146 $ ] explains the time constant to the case with constant passage times seems difficult .    how does the time constant depend on the direction ? from table [ tab_est ]",
    "we see that , for each given distribution , the estimated time constant increases with @xmath93 . comparing two consecutive angles ,",
    "the differences are of the order @xmath167 , while the standard deviations are of the order @xmath168 , and the differences are hence statistically significant .",
    "we conclude that the growth is fastest along the axis and slowest along the diagonal .",
    "the conclusion is the same for the additional simulations for translated distributions .",
    "we now turn to the asymptotic shape . the last paragraph in the previous section indicates that , for all simulated distributions , the asymptotic shape is contained in a circle with radius given by the speed @xmath169 of the growth along the axes .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma_shape ] shows the boundary of the infected sets ( in single realizations ) for @xmath136-distributions with @xmath170 .",
    "we have first checked roughly how long the simulations have to run to reach the point @xmath171 and the pictures are then based on realizations up to such fixed times ( which hence may be different for different pictures ) . a circle with radius given by the estimated asymptotic speed of the growth along the axes is included for comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : fi_shape ] shows corresponding pictures for @xmath172 distributions with @xmath142 , and figure [ fig : u_shape ] for the uniform distribution u(0,1 ) . from the pictures we see that the shape seems to be closer to a circle for distributions with larger variability .",
    "indeed , for the gamma distributions , the variance increases as @xmath138 decreases , the @xmath173 distributions are more heavy - tailed for smaller values of @xmath174 . comparing the different distribution types , we also see that the shapes for the heavy - tailed fisher type distributions are the most circle - like .",

    "figures [ fig : exptrans_shape ] and [ fig : fitrans_shape ] show pictures of the shape for the translated exponential and @xmath182 distributions , with pictures for the non - translated distributions included for comparison ( also with @xmath155 ) .",

    "as pointed out after theorem [ th : shape ] , the infected region will then have uninfected points in its interior that are visible on a linear scale .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : fi_heavy_shape ] , with pictures of the boundary of the infected set for @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",

    ".    recall from section [ sec : as ] that the fluctuations of the interface between the infected set @xmath116 and its complement is believed to be of the order @xmath117 with @xmath118 , so that the standard deviation of the hitting time @xmath185 is of the order @xmath186 , and the fluctuations of the location where @xmath116 hits a line at distance @xmath26 from the origin is conjectured to be of the order @xmath187 with @xmath125 .",
    "we close this section by referring to figure [ fig : bscaling ] for some support of this .",

    "recall however that the standard deviation is likely to be too small so that the confidence interval shold in fact be wider .",
    "a contributing factor may also be that we have recorded hitting times to lines rather than to points and such hitting times of course have smaller variance .",

    "we have studied the speed and shape of first passage percolation on @xmath0 by aid of computer simulations . focusing on continuous passage time distributions ,",
    "the simulated distributions include the exponential distribution , gamma distributions , uniform distributions and power - law distributions .",

    "indeed , figure [ fig : tc_e4 ] reveals a close to linear relation for the simulated distributions . for translated versions of the distributions ,",
    "the relation is less clear along the axis , but becomes more linear closer to the diagonal .",
    "for the asymptotic shape , we have found that , for all simulated distributions , the shape is contained in a circle with radius @xmath194 .",
    "constant passage times give a diamond as asymptotic shape and , when the variance decreases for a given distribution type , the shape comes closer to the diamond .",
    "when the variance increases , on the other hand , the shape approaches the circle . in figure",
    "[ fig : kvot_cv ] , the deviations from the circles , quantified by the ratio @xmath175 , are plotted against the variational coefficient @xmath147/{{\\mathbf e}}_4 ^ 2[\\tau]$ ] for all simulated distributions and indeed we see a negative relation .",
    "finally , we have investigated the exponents for the standard deviation of hitting times and for the fluctuations of hitting points on lines and our findings are in line with the predicted values 1/3 and 2/3 , respectively .",
    "we finish with a few ideas for theoretical investigations :    * as mentioned in section [ sim_tc ] , we believe that @xmath159 $ ] is true in great generality .",
    "is it possible to find sufficient conditions on the passage time distribution for this ? * prove that @xmath92 is increasing in @xmath177 $ ] , perhaps for some suitable class of passage time distributions .",
    "this would imply that the asymptotic shape is indeed contained in the circle .",
    "* does the shape come arbitrarily close to a circle when the variational coefficient @xmath147/{{\\mathbf e}}_4 ^ 2[\\tau]$ ] ( or some other quantification of the variability of the distribution ) becomes large ?",
