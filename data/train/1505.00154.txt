    "the search - enhanced instantaneous frequency detection ( seifd ) algorithm uses genetic algorithm ( ga ) @xcite to identify the characteristics of sinusoidal components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sinudoidal - component ] ) within a nonlinear non - stationary time series data .",
    "the time - series data is modeled as a superposition of these components , each exist within a unique time range .",
    "it is represented as below .",
    "@xmath0    where , @xmath1 is the index of each sinusoidal component ; @xmath2 is its amplitude ; @xmath3 , is its frequency ; and @xmath4 is its phase .",
    "the parameters which define each of the components are encoded as a solution string consisting binary values . during implementation ,",
    "the ga attempts to find their value by simulating it as a solution improvement process modeled as a series of genetic evolutions .    because the problem is non - stationary , each of the sinusoidal components possesses unique start and end time ( denoted respectively as @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "they are as well encoded in the solution string . in this way , the solver attempts to decompose the time - series data into its consituting sinusoidal components in order to reveal the instantaneous frequencies of the time - series data .",
    "the sinusoidal parameters are encoded as a string of binary values .",
    "the length of the binary string is determined based on the sum of the bit counts carried by each of the parameters computed with their respective lower and upper bound , as well as the step size of increment .",

    "the solution string is organized as shown in fig .",

    "the solution string is regarded as a chromosome ( fig .",

    "the fitness function describes the environment ( the solution space ) in which the chromosomes evolve .",
    "the implementation should achive continuous improvement ( lower fitness function in every subsequent generation ) until the fitness score converged at a targeted fitness score",
    ". the targeted fitness score of @xmath16 is 0 .",
    "then , ga selects some chromosomes possessing good fitness score for creating new offsprings in the subsequent repetitions . in the process ,",
    "the algorithm identify and retain good alleles that lead to the yielding of better fitness scores .",
    "meanwhile , it modifies the inferior allele values using simulated biological crossover and mutation processes .",
    "the operation is repeated until the termination criterion is finally met .",
    "compare to fourier transforms , the method adaptively identifies the start and end of such sinusoidal components ( within the time horizon of the data ) , as well as their exact instantaneous attributes . among others , its performance is not constrained by : i. ) the need to ensure the completion of at least one oscillation cycle in all of the sinusoidal components ; and ii . )",
    "the existence of discontinuity within the data .",
    "the result fulfills the following generalized fourier representation @xcite :    @xmath17    the identification of the quantity of sinusoidal components at every time step , @xmath18 can be solved as a combinatorial optimization ( co ) problem ( the ga is a well - known approach for solving co problems ( i.e. , @xcite ) ) . to do so",
