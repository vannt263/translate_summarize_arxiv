    "in recent years much theoretical activity has been devoted to generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) .",
    "they are defined as nondiagonal hadronic matrix elements of bilocal products of the light - front quark and gluon field operators and they interpolate between the inclusive physics of parton distributions and the exclusive limit of electromagnetic form factors  @xcite . as such they contain information on parton correlations and the internal spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "but the main interest to study gpd s comes from the fact that , due to the factorization theorem  @xcite , they are candidate to provide us with a unifying theoretical background suitable to describe a variety of inclusive and exclusive processes in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) regime . in particular , they enter the cross section for exclusive photon production , i.e. deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs )  @xcite , and hard diffractive electroproduction of ( longitudinal ) vector and pseudo - scalar meson  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the forward limit they become diagonal matrix elements giving the usual dis parton distribution , and their first moment gives the nucleon elastic form factors  @xcite .",
    "basic properties of the gpd s have been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "much effort is underway related to the measurement of these functions .",
    "a general discussion about the problems arising in the experimental study of the gpd s and the first experimental evidences have been presented in ref .",
    "prospects for future measurements of dvcs are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "model calculations are a necessary prerequisite to define suitable strategies to extract gpd s from experiments . in the literature",
    "there are two approaches used to model the nucleon gpd s .",
    "one is a phenomenological construction based on reduction formulas where gpd s are related to the usual parton distributions by factorizing the momentum transfer dependence due to the nucleon electroweak form factors  @xcite .",
    "this leads to double distribution functions parametrizing the nonforward matrix elements involved in dvcs and hard exclusive electroproduction processes discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "another approach is based on direct calculation of gpd s in specific dynamical models .",
    "the first model calculations were performed using the mit bag model  @xcite .",
    "further calculations have been performed in the chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite .",
    "a complete and exact overlap representation of gpd s has been recently worked out within the framework of light - cone quantisation  @xcite . in particular , quark gpd s",
    "are obtained as overlaps of light - cone wave functions ( lcwf s ) indicating that they are deeply connected with the non - diagonal one - body density matrix in momentum space occurring in any nonrelativistic many - body problem .",
    "a preliminar investigation of such an approach was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , direct calculation of lcwf s from first principles is a difficult task . on the other hand ,",
    "constituent quark models ( cqm s ) have been quite successful in describing the spectrum of hadrons and their low - energy dynamics .",
    "therefore it is interesting to explore the connection between gpd s and cqm wave functions at least in the allowed kinematic range where only quark degrees of freedom are effective .",
    "this corresponds to the kinematic region where gpd s describe how a quark is taken out from the proton and , having undergone a hard scattering , is inserted back as a quark inside the scattered proton .",
    "this connection has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where a simple nonrelativistic quark model has been used to calculate one of the twist - two gpd s at a low - energy scale .",
    "however , as in the case of parton distributions calculated from cqm wave functions a nonrelativistic approach is obviously insufficient  @xcite and a consequence of it is that the obtained gpd s are not defined on their natural support and the particle number and momentum sum rules are not always preserved .",
    "the support violation occurs also with the mit bag model  @xcite because the initial and final nucleons are not good momentum eigenstates .",
    "these are common problems arising also in the case of parton distributions calculated from cqm wave functions  @xcite where they were cured by appropriately taking into account translation invariance  @xcite .",
    "cqm s rely on quantum theory with a finite number of degrees of freedom . in this case relativity",
    "can be incorporated quite naturally by utilizing relativistic hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite and the bakamjian - thomas  @xcite construction of the hamiltonian for a system of interacting particles .",
    "in such an approach cqm wave functions can be considered as eigenfunctions of the nucleon hamiltonian in the instant - form dynamics and can simply be related to wave functions in any form of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "examples are the light - front description of electromagnetic form factors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and the covariant calculation of the nucleon electroweak form factors  @xcite in a chiral cqm  @xcite with the point - form approach .",
    "similarly , one can obtain a link between cqm wave functions and lcwf s with the corresponding transformation from the instant - form to the front - form representation as it is here proposed .",
    "gpd s in the allowed kinematic region are then obtained in a covariant approach and they exhibit the exact forward limit reproducing the parton distribution with the correct support and automatically fulfilling the particle number and momentum sum rules .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the relevant definitions and properties of gpd s in terms of lcwf s are recalled . in sect .",
    "3 the connection is established between the ( light - cone ) front - form and the ( canonical ) instant - form description . this connection is used in sect . 4 to obtain the unpolarized gpd s and their forward limits , i.e. the usual dis parton distributions in terms of cqm wave functions .",
    "the results obtained with different cqm wave functions are presented in sect . 5 , confining some technical details in the appendix , and concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "for definiteness let us consider virtual compton scattering where a lepton exchanges a virtual photon of momentum @xmath4 with a nucleon of momentum @xmath5 , producing a real photon of momentum @xmath6 and a recoil nucleon of momentum @xmath7 .",
    "ultimately we are here interested in kinematic conditions similar to those familiar in the dis regime that is characterized by the bjorken limit , i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and fixed @xmath10 .",
    "when focusing on the deeply virtual kinematic regime of @xmath4 , i.e. dvcs , a generalization of the bjorken kinematics is considered , namely the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath11 and the photon virtuality @xmath12 are large while the invariant momentum square @xmath13 is small  @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the factorization theorem  @xcite tells us that the amplitude factorizes in a hard scattering part ( which is exactly calculable in perturbative qcd ) and a soft , nonperturbative nucleon structure part .",
    "the contribution of the hard scattering part to leading order corresponds to the so called handbag diagram with photon scattering on a single parton ( quark or antiquark ) .",
    "consequently , the soft part is a quark - quark correlation function , representing the process where a parton is taken out of the initial nucleon and reinserted back into the final nucleon after hard scattering . to describe such a process , according to ref .",

    "gives the following values for the nucleon anomalous magnetic moments : @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "these results are rather far from the experimental values and consistent with analogous light - front calculations when pointlike structure of the quark is assumed  @xcite .",
    "the su(6 ) breaking effects which produce deviations from the value @xmath115 come mainly from the melosh rotations , with a small additional contribution from the quark wave functions in the case of the gbe model .",
    "the @xmath88 dependence of @xmath116 and @xmath109 is rather smooth and in both models it does not reproduce the experimental results : a clear limitation due to the assumed pointlike structure of the quarks which can be solved by the introduction of specific quark form factors  @xcite .",
    "a fully covariant approach has been presented linking the overlap representation of generalized parton distributions  @xcite to the non - diagonal one - body density matrix in momentum space . as a result of the correct transformation of the wave functions from the ( canonical ) instant - form to the ( light - cone ) front - form description ,",
    "the support condition is automatically fulfilled and the particle number and momentum sum rules are also satisfied .",
    "the method has been applied to the case of nucleon wave functions involving only the three valence quarks in order to study gpd s in terms of constituent quark model wave functions .",
    "this implies that the discussion of gpd s has to be confined to the region @xmath117 .",
    "in this region one can easily derive the usual parton distributions and appreciate the advantages of a fully covariant treatment avoiding problems connected with the support condition and the flux factor introduced in other approaches .",
    "in addition , the helicity flip gpd s naturally arise thanks to the relativistic effects of the melosh rotations .",

    "a weak @xmath29 dependence has been found in all cases , confirming the results obtained within the mit bag model  @xcite . keeping in mind the limitation @xmath118 due to the inclusion of the lowest order fock - space components with three valence quarks",
