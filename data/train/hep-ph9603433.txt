    "the lepton pair serves as an event trigger .",
    "the cut on @xmath108 is included to remove the reducible backgrounds from other dilepton sources .      the @xmath13-tagging capability of any detector is mainly defined by the tracker system quality .",
    "preliminary cms results indicate that the average @xmath13-tagging efficiency at the level of 40% with a mistagging probability of about 2% can be achieved quite easily with the microvertex detectors @xcite .",
    "the algorithm applied combines common impact parameter and lepton tagging techniques .",
    "these values look quite reasonable in light of the recent cdf results @xcite .",
    "there is some hope that some more sophisticated @xmath13-tagging algorithms will allow one to achieve the @xmath13-tagging efficiency of 60% with a purity of 1% for both the cms and the atlas experiments .    because of the existing uncertainties we prefer to use here a rather artificial and simplified but more general way to take into account @xmath13-tagging .",
    "namely , all jets are matched as a @xmath13-jet or a non @xmath13-jet when they are generated . in our analysis , a given jet passing kinematical cuts is matched as a @xmath13-jet if there is a @xmath13-quark in a cone @xmath109 , where @xmath110 of course , there is some ambiguity in this procedure , but we have checked that more than 95% of the @xmath13-jets from the @xmath111 decays are matched correctly .",
    "our procedure then allows us to apply a simplified parameterization of the @xmath13-tagging efficiency to the same event sample simply rejecting or accepting a given jet in the event with a certain probability .",
    "relevant backgrounds can be separated into two groups .",
    "the first one contains irreducible background processes with a @xmath1 and two @xmath13-jets in the final state .",
    "the second one contains all other potential backgrounds without a @xmath1 or two @xmath13-jets in the final state . in our analysis , we have applied double @xmath13-tagging to extract the signal since after a preliminary analysis it quickly became evident that single @xmath13-tagging is not sufficient .",

    "we estimate this process contribution using the @xmath114 subprocess incorporated in pythia @xcite .",

    "the second jet is generated in the parton shower evolution .",
    "to avoid the double counting , events with two tagged @xmath13-jets in the final state were eliminated from the @xmath118 sample .",
    "the background from @xmath119 is at the same level of @xmath120jets after the minimal cuts and can be reduced further by a factor of 3 with the additional cut ( ii ) on the missing @xmath121 , @xmath122 the potentially dangerous background from @xmath123 is below the level of the dominant @xmath124 by a factor of 10 - 20 , so the peak at @xmath125 in the @xmath126 background distribution is nearly invisible",

    "we have unsuccessfully attempted to improve the significance of the signal using harder kinematical cuts .",
    "it seems that to optimize significance one has to use as soft cuts on @xmath134 and @xmath135 as possible taking into account detector limitations .",
    "this conclusion is valid over almost the whole mass and @xmath16 range except some small region for @xmath136 gev and @xmath137 , where harder cuts provide some small increase in the significance compared to the softest cuts used .    the last comment concerning fig .",
    "4 is that all background distributions are peaked around @xmath138 gev .",

    "this discovery channel , @xmath139 , is especially attractive because it allows one , in principle , to reconstruct the masses for both the @xmath0 and the @xmath2 .",
    "the optimal experimental procedure to extract the signal from the background seems to be an iterative one . at the first step",
    ", all @xmath140 events passing the cuts i , ii , iii , and with both @xmath13-tagged jets have to be preselected . then , in the case of known @xmath73 , one can directly use the restriction @xmath141 to improve the observability of the @xmath0 in the @xmath142 distribution .",
    "the window size @xmath143 depends on the detector resolution . for the cms detector",
    "we estimate @xmath144 gev for this particular kinematical region .",
    "it has to be stressed that the reconstructed @xmath126 has the systematic downward shift about 5 - 7 gev when one uses the usual cone jet - finding algorithms . in the case",
    "that @xmath73 is beyond the reach of lep ii , one can use some ` sliding window ' procedure .",
    "namely , one should scan the relevant @xmath145 region by small steps , every time placing the middle of the window into the new position , trying to observe some bump in the @xmath146 distribution .",
    "if there is some peak in the @xmath147 distribution , one should apply the last step to improve observability for the @xmath2 ( if its mass is unknown ) by histogramming the @xmath148 distribution only for events with @xmath147 in some window around the @xmath149 .    in fig .",
    "5 , we illustrate the procedure of extracting the signal for @xmath150 gev and @xmath151 .",

    "the second row presents the @xmath153 distributions provided the optimal @xmath148 position is chosen . and",
    "the last row demonstrates the @xmath2 signal over the background provided the events are selected within the proper @xmath153 mass range around the bumps found .",
