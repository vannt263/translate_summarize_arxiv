    "nuclear forces play a decisive role in our understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei , driving the creation and evolution of shell gaps , the onset of deformation , development of halo structures , and determining the limits of particle stability .",
    "the nuclear shell model provides a framework to determine the properties of nuclei from a set of single - particle energies ( spes ) and two - body matrix elements ( tbmes ) defined in a given valence space outside some assumed inert core .",
    "when based only on two - nucleon ( nn ) forces within the valence space , the spes and tbmes need suitable renormalization to experimental data to provide a precise description of nuclear structure .",
    "these `` effective '' spes and tbmes implicitly capture the effects of many - body processes , such as core polarization , as well as neglected three - nucleon ( 3n ) forces @xcite and coupling to the particle continuum .",
    "as the standard shell - model approach typically uses tbmes that are independent of mass number @xmath5 or simply scaled , it may become insufficient near the limits of stability , where the last nucleons are only loosely bound and have radial wavefunctions which extend to larger radii and couple to unbound states @xcite .",
    "reductions of the neutron - neutron tbme by 25% were required to model the structure of the neutron - rich c isotopes , which are a factor of two less bound than the o isotopes @xcite .",
    "more recently , the study of the weakly bound @xmath6f nucleus , which can be viewed as an @xmath0o core plus a deeply bound @xmath7 proton and an unbound @xmath8 neutron , has shown that a reduction of the @xmath9 tbme by about 20% better reproduced the energies of its @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 states  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent theoretical calculations for states close to the neutron - separation threshold show that an increased role of coupling to the particle continuum may in part account for the modification of shell structure of dripline nuclei @xcite .    the fluorine isotopic chain is well suited to study the evolution of valence - space interactions with increased valence neutron - to - proton asymmetry towards the dripline .",
    "moreover , many f isotopes are located near the doubly magic @xmath13o , @xmath14o and @xmath0o systems . considering these o isotopes as almost inert cores , fluorine wavefunctions",
    "should then be weakly mixed , making possible the search for subtle effects related to their weak binding and proximity to the continuum .",

    "the only exception is a @xmath79 state at @xmath80 , also predicted with usda , b , which is likely not seen experimentally due to the difficulty of the fragmentation method in populating low-@xmath81 states . since coupling to the continuum is currently neglected , when included , a modest lowering of the @xmath63 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 states would be expected near threshold .",

    "<S> the structure of the @xmath0f nucleus has been studied at ganil using the @xmath1 decay of @xmath0o and the in - beam @xmath2-ray spectroscopy from the fragmentation of projectile nuclei . combining these complementary experimental techniques , </S>",
    "<S> the level scheme of @xmath0f has been constructed up to @xmath3 by means of particle-@xmath2 and particle-@xmath4 coincidence relations . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results are compared to shell - model calculations using the standard usda and usdb interactions as well as ab - initio valence - space hamiltonians calculated from the in - medium similarity renormalization group based on chiral two- and three - nucleon forces . </S>",
    "<S> both methods reproduce the measured level spacings well , and this close agreement allows unidentified spins and parities to be consistently assigned . </S>"
