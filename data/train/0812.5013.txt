    "the origin of matrices and determinants lies deep in ancient civilizations . around the second century bc ,",
    "the babylonians studied linear equations and the chineese used matrices to find solutions to simple systems of linear equations , in two or three unknowns @xcite .",
    "however , only in the late 17-th century these ideas became widely known and flourished with different applications .",
    "the theory of _ linear _ equations and transformations , now known as _ linear algebra _ , has completely proved its worth not only in pure science , but also in applied problems and in engineering .",
    "for example , gauss himself applied linear algebra to determine the orbit of the asteroid pallas @xcite . using observations of pallas taken between 1803 and 1809 , gauss obtained and solved a system of six linear equations in six unknowns .    soon after that , it became clear to researchers ( cayley , sylvester and others @xcite ) that linear algebra is just the simplest case of more general framework  of _ polynomial _ equations and transformations .",
    "they realized , that many parts of linear algebra have natural generalizations to arbitrary polynomials , not necessarily linear .",
    "notably , determinant has such a generalization . a linear system in two unknowns @xmath0 is solvable ( has a non - trivial solution @xmath1 ) if and only if its determinant vanishes    @xmath2    and in complete analogy , a quadratic system @xmath3 is solvable if and only if certain expression , depending on coefficients , vanishes :    @xmath4    this expression  a generalization of @xmath5 determinant from linear to quadratic equations  is called a _",
    "resultant_. it was sylvester who first studied it @xcite and found the analogues for cubic , quartic and equations of higher degrees .",
    "resultants also exist for more than two variables : in this case they provide non - linear geneneralizations of @xmath6 determinant .",
    "a system @xmath7 + of @xmath8 homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath9 in @xmath8 variables @xmath10 is solvable , if and only if an expression called its resultant vanishes : @xmath11 for linear systems resultant @xmath12 is just a determinant , the well - known and well - understood object of linear algebra . unfortunately , the knowledge and understanding of general resultants is not equally deep , yet .",
    "moreover , the very direction of generalization  from linear algebra to arbitrary algebraic equations  has been almost completely forgotten after the 19-th century , and was revived only recently , after profound book of gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky @xcite .    for several reasons ,",
    "we suggest to call this direction _ non - linear algebra _ @xcite .",
    "it is expected to have as many applications as its linear cousin , if not more .",
    "resultants  the main `` special functions '' of non - linear algebra  are already used in physics to describe , for example , multiparticle entanglement @xcite , singularities of calabi - yau three - folds @xcite , discrete dynamics @xcite .",
    "there are applications to modeling and robotics @xcite .",
    "however , applications remain restricted , partially because calculation of resultants is not as easy as that of determinants , especially when the number of variables is large .",
    "it is often convenient to speak about systems of equations in terms of maps .",
    "linear algebra studies linear maps between two spaces of dimensions @xmath13 and @xmath8 @xmath14 which are given by linear polynomials : @xmath15 accordingly , non - linear algebra studies non - linear ( polynomial ) maps : @xmath16 system ( [ 1 ] ) corresponds to the particularly interesting case of @xmath17 .",
    "when the system ( [ 1 ] ) is solvable , the corresponding map ( [ 2 ] ) is degenerate , i.e , has a non - vanishing kernel .",
    "as one can see , resultant defines a degeneracy condition for polynomial maps .",
    "of course , it is very interesting to study further generalizations : to arbitrary non - linear mappings ( not necessarily polynomial ) . for such generalizations and appropriate notion of resultant ,",
    "see @xcite .    the second ,",
    "essentially different , generalization of determinant was introduced by cayley approximately at the same time @xcite . instead of a single linear map between two spaces @xmath14 he considered a",
    "_ complex _  sequence of two linear maps between three spaces @xmath18 subject to _ nilpotency _ constraint @xmath19 .",
    "generally , the number of spaces can be arbitrary @xmath20 and the maps satisfy @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "cayley has found a quantity , associated to complexes in the same way as determinant is associated to linear maps .",
    "this quantity is now called _ determinant of a complex_. for example , consider a sequence of two maps between spaces of dimensions 1 , 2 and 1 :    @xmath23 + composition of these maps    @xmath24 + is requested to vanish .",
    "determinant @xmath25 can be represented in three different ways @xmath26 where @xmath27 is simply the euclidean length of vector @xmath28 .",
    "equivalence of all three follows from the above condition @xmath29 .",
    "this example shows , that determinant of complex is not a polynomial , it is a rational function .",
    "it vanishes when @xmath30 and is singular when @xmath31",
    ". it may be not obvious at the moment , but we will see below , that such a quantity is indeed a natural generalization of determinant and has a number of important properties .",
    "in particular , determinant of a complex is ( up to overall sign ) invariant under permutations of basis vectors in the linear spaces .",
    "it should be emphasized , that complexes are essentially objects of linear algebra and can be effectively treated using linear methods .",
    "for this reason the theory of complexes and their determinants , which is now called _",
    "homological algebra _ ,",
    "is more developed and attracts incomparably more attention , than resultant theory .",
    "homological algebra has a wide range of physical applications , from topological field theories and invariants @xcite to faddeev - popov s ghosts and batalin - vilkovisky approach to quantizing particle lagrangians and lagrangians of string field theory @xcite and further to description of branes in terms of derived categories @xcite .",
    "it has been known since cayley , that resultants of non - linear maps and determinants of complexes are , in fact , related .",
    "namely , given a non - linear map one can construct a complex , called _ koszul complex _",
    ", whose determinant is equal to resultant of the original map . actually , this relation is one of a few reliable ways to calculate resultants , known at the moment .",
    "several other ways to calculate resultants , not involving complexes , are described in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain this relation in clear and practical terms , making the text accessible for beginners .",
    "it can be considered as pure pedagogical , since most of the results are quite classical and known to the experts ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is interesting and important to calculate resultants . before discussing the calculation methods",
    ", we formulate the basic properties of resultants .",
    "as mentioned above , resultant @xmath32 defines a degeneracy condition for polynomial maps of degree @xmath9 in @xmath8 variables @xmath33 where @xmath10 resultant @xmath34 vanishes on degenerate maps and only on them .",
    "to say it another way , resultant is a common divisor of all polynomials , which vanish on degenerate maps . by this very definition , @xmath34 is an irreducible polynomial in coefficients of @xmath35 .",
    "irreducibility of resultant is a generalization of the well - known fact , that determinant of a generic matrix is irreducible . for illustration , resultant @xmath36 does not decompose into smaller factors .",
    "however , for non - generic maps  say , if some coefficients vanish  such decomposition does take place . for illustration",
    ", the resultant @xmath37 decomposes into smaller factors .",
    "the same holds for higher degrees of equations . for further study of resultant s irreducibility properties ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "another important property of @xmath38 is that it has a simple interpretation in terms of polynomials roots .",
    "for example , consider a system of two polynomials of arbitrary degree in two variables : @xmath39    @xmath40 resultant of this system is given by a simple formula @xmath41 because the above system is solvable , if and only if @xmath42 for some @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , the right hand side is nothing but the product of values of @xmath44 on 2-vectors @xmath45 , which are roots of @xmath46 : r_2|r ~f(_1 ) ",
    "f(_r ) ,  _ i = g(x , y ) [ poisson2d ] generalization to the case of @xmath8 variables is straightforward .",
    "resultant of a system @xmath47 where @xmath48 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath9 , is given by a simple formula r_n|r ~f(_1 ) ",
    "f(_n ) ,  _",
    "i = f_2(x_1 ,  , x_n ) ,  , f_n(x_1 ,  , x_n ) [ poissonnd ] the number @xmath49 of common roots of a system of @xmath50 equations of degrees @xmath51 is equal to @xmath52 in our case , we have all @xmath53 , therefore the number of common roots is @xmath54",
    ". it immediately follows that @xmath38 is a homogeneous polynomial in coefficients of the first equation of degree @xmath49 . since ( [ poissonnd ] ) can be analogously written with any @xmath55 in place of @xmath56 , resultant @xmath38 in fact has degree @xmath49 in coefficients of any particular equation @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , it is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath57 in coefficients of all equations . for @xmath58",
    ", we recover the degree of determinant : @xmath59 . for systems of quadratic equations , @xmath60 , for cubic equations @xmath61 , and so on .    despite being simple",
    ", the formula ( [ poissonnd ] )  called _ poisson product formula _  is not very useful for calculation of resultants , because it is rather hard to find common roots of @xmath50 non - linear equations in @xmath8 variables .",
    "the roots are complicated functions of coefficients , which generally can not be expressed through radicals .",
    "fortunately , poisson product formula can be rewritten in several ways , which do not contain the roots explicitly .",
    "such reformulations @xcite are more convenient in practical calculations .",

    "after the expansion , we obtain a polynomial ( if we include a multiplier @xmath79 ) : @xmath80 @xmath81    @xmath82 in this way , we can calculate a resultant of two quadratic equations in two unknowns .",
    "note , that it has degree 4 in map s coefficients , in accord with the general formula @xmath83 .",
    "however , it is hardly possible to use such an approach , when the degree of equations ( or , worse than that , the number of variables ) is greater than two .",
    "one needs another method to go beyond the simplest examples .",
    "the most classical resultant calculating method , which allows to go beyond the simplest examples , was found by sylvester @xcite .",
    "this method is to express resultant as a determinant of some auxiliary matrix .",
    "such expression tautologically exists for linear maps in two variables @xmath84 and sylvester has found , that it also exists for quadratic maps in two variables @xmath85 as well as for cubic maps in two variables @xmath86 and for all higher degrees in two variables : @xmath87 the beauty and simplicity made this formula and corresponding resultant @xmath88 widely known .",
    "note , that it has degree @xmath89 in map s coefficients , in accord with the general formula @xmath90 .    in our days , sylvester method is the main apparatus used to calculate two - dimensional resultants and it is the only piece of resultant theory included in undergraduate text books ( see for example @xcite ) . however , its generalization to @xmath91 is not straightforward .",
    "one possible generalization , representing resultant as _ the determinant of koszul complex _ , is the subject of present paper .",
    "this generalization of sylvester formula is the most widely known one .",
    "other generalizations , which produce determinantal formulas for @xmath91 , are still the subject of active research ( see , for example , @xcite ) .      to describe koszul complexes , we need several definitions .",
    "the basic object we deal with are homogeneous polynomials .",

    "introduce now @xmath8 auxiliary grassmanian variables @xmath95 such , that @xmath96 the set of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath93 in @xmath97 and of degree @xmath98 in @xmath99 is again a linear space with monomial basis @xmath100 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath101 for this linear space . note that @xmath102 : if a polynomial has degree in @xmath95-variables bigger than @xmath8 , it vanishes identically , because @xmath95 are anti - commuting variables .",
    "introduction of such anti - commuting variables leads to a new possibility : given a polynomial map @xmath103 one can construct a linear operator @xmath104 which is nilpotent : @xmath105 this operator , called _ koszul differential _ , acts on the spaces @xmath101 in the following way : @xmath106 in this way , operator @xmath107 generates a sequence of linear spaces , called a _",

    "if resultant vanishes , then determinant @xmath123 must vanish : @xmath124 for this reason @xmath125 since both @xmath123 and @xmath126 are polynomials of degree @xmath127 in @xmath128 , the coefficient @xmath129 is just a numeric factor .",

    "now we will consider an example , where non - trivial complex  a sequence of several matrices  arises .",
    "we return to linear maps in two variables , where @xmath107 has a form @xmath109 we will consider its action on another spaces @xmath130 in bases @xmath131 differential is represented by a pair of rectangular matrices ( not a single square matrix this time ) : @xmath132 resultant @xmath66 is closely related to these matrices : the system with the matrix @xmath133 @xmath134 which is a linear system in monomials @xmath135 , has a non - zero solution if resultant @xmath66 vanishes . in this case ,",
    "matrix @xmath133 becomes degenerate : @xmath136 this is only possible , if all minors of @xmath133 are divisible by @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 should be a common factor of all these minors .",
    "as direct calculation shows @xmath137 @xmath138 this is indeed true :    @xmath139    this example illustrates that , for one and the same polynomial map , there can be many different koszul complexes , differing by the choice of linear spaces @xmath101 .",
    "depending on this choice , the complex can become either simpler or more complicated : in the above examples the simpler complex was @xmath110 and the more complicated complex was @xmath130 in other words , the differential is fixed , but we are free to choose the linear spaces . in practice , one usually chooses a complex which is as simple as possible .",
    "moreover , this example illustrates the role of the first matrix @xmath140 .",

    "as one can see , the other factors of minors @xmath141 are , up to a sign , elements of @xmath140 . therefore , @xmath66 can be found by division of minors of @xmath141 on conjugate minors of @xmath140 .",
    "this ratio is a particular example of what we call determinant of a complex .",
    "remarkably , for koszul complex the ratio is actually a _ polynomial _ in the coefficients of the map @xmath35 .",
    "a sequence of linear maps between several linear spaces @xmath142 is called a @xmath93-term _ complex _ iff nilpotency condition @xmath143 is satisfied .",
    "linear spaces @xmath144 of dimensions @xmath145 are called _ terms _ of the complex .",
    "therefore , an ordinary linear map is a 2-term complex ( a complex , which consists of two linear spaces and a single map between them ) .",
    "operators @xmath146 are called differential operators . according to the standard terminology , if a vector is equal to differential of some other vector ( i.e , lies in the image of differential @xmath147 )",
    "@xmath148 it is called _",

    "closed_. equivalently , nilpotency condition can be expressed as @xmath151 that is , any exact vector is closed .",
    "it is very important , that the inverse is , generally speaking , wrong : there can be vectors , which are closed but not exact . in other words",
    ", there can be vectors from ker @xmath152 which do not belong to i m @xmath153 .",
    "such vectors again form a linear space @xmath154 of dimension @xmath155 , called @xmath22-th _ cohomology _ space of @xmath156 .",
    "elements of @xmath157 are called cohomologies . a complex , which has no cohomologies ( i.e , with @xmath158 for all @xmath22 ) is called _ exact complex _ , because all closed elements in such a complex are exact .",
    "the notion of cohomology is so important in theory of complexes , that the whole field is known as `` homological '' algebra .",
    "it is well known from linear algebra , that @xmath159 at the same time , by definition of cohomology @xmath160 from these two identities , it follows @xmath161 if we take an alternating sum , dimensions of the kernel spaces drop away : _ k = 1^p ( -1)^k l_k = _ k = 1^p ( -1)^k h_k [ euler ] this alternating combination of dimensions is usually called _",
