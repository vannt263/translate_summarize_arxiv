    "the placement of pawns is then completely specified by an @xmath1 binary matrix . moreover , to be a legal placement , the binary matrix can not contain the following two letter words : and ( here we use the fact that all pawns are of the same colour and thus they are allowed to attack at the same directions : either at north - west and north - east or at south - west and south - east ) .",
