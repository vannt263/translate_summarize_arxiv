    "when an object receives a full rotational turn , it becomes entangled  with its environment .",
    "this is second nature to anyone who winds up a garden hose .",
    "as more turns are applied , we feel intuitively that the entanglement magnifies via increasingly wound strings ( visible or invisible ) connecting the object to fixed surroundings .",
    "however , outlandish as it may seem , three - dimensional space does nt actually behave like this !",
    "mathematicians and physicists have long known that while a single full turn entangles , two turns can be untangled . for physicists",
    "this provides an analogy for understanding electron spin @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "41.6 , p. 1149 ) , and for mathematicians it is a statement about the topology of the rotation group @xmath0 .",
    "visual demonstrations of untanglings @xcite often have physical origins , with names like the dirac scissors demonstration  @xcite , dirac belt trick , feynman plate trick , or indonesian or philippine candle dance .",
    "while these fascinating demonstrations convince one that untangling a double - twist is possible , they have an ad hoc feel , and it is hard to see mathematically how they achieve an untangling .",
    "for instance , if you are familiar with the belt trick ( discussed in detail in the next section ) , one thing you may notice is that however you perform it , apparently some place on the belt undergoes a 180@xmath1 rotation ( ignoring any translation in 3-space that may occur ) at some time during the trick . but can one find a way to avoid this , or is it a mathematical necessity ? and are there other constraints that are nt easily guessed just from watching such demonstrations ?",
    "we will actually discover much stronger constraints than this , and prove them all in our every - which - way theorem of section  [ eww ] .",
    "shortly we will explain that formally an untangling is a _ based nullhomotopy _ of the double - twist loop within the space of rotations of three - space . here",
    "are some questions we will then address : how efficient can a based nullhomotopy be ?",
    "for instance , what portion of the rotations in @xmath0 must an untangling utilize , and could each rotation utilized be used just once , apart from those in the double - twist itself ? how much must a based nullhomotopy move individual vector directions around in three - space ? and finally , what does a maximally efficient based nullhomotopy _",
    "look _ like ?",
    "our responses to these questions will include illustrative images and supporting videos and animations .",
    "even though at first you probably can not even imagine that it is possible , you should emerge able to wave  a most efficient nullhomotopy of the double - twist with your hand , and easily teach it to your friends .",
    "physical untangling demonstrations make the above questions difficult to visualize , partly because the objects involved in the demonstration ( dirac s belt , the dancer s arm ) move in space during the demonstration , obscuring a focus on the rotations involved .",
    "we might prefer to watch the untangling process play out in a family of movies performed by an object , centered at the origin , rotating about various axes through the origin . to achieve this",
    ", we will first construct a particular based nullhomotopy directly from rotation geometry .",
    "we will then utilize properties of our nullhomotopy to deduce minimum constraints on the complexity required by any based nullhomotopy , and will find that ours is as efficient as possible subject to these constraints .",
    "our techniques involve degree theory , spherical geometry , and covering spaces , and we emphasize the quaternionic viewpoint on rotations .",
    "while reading , limber up your right hand and arm ; we can not be responsible for sore muscles and joints .",
    "a second independent time coordinate would also be very useful .",
    "if you have one , rev it up ; if not , we will stretch your brain to improvise one .",
    "finally , if you just ca nt wait for visualization , animations , and handwaving , then you can skip ahead , after sections 2 and 3 , to sections 7 and 8 .",
    "we need to make precise what we do and do nt mean by untangling .",
    "the short answer is that untanglings will be _ based nullhomotopies of loops _ in the space of rotations of @xmath2-space , but we will first explain the ideas more casually by describing and illustrating two physical processes that give rise to untanglings .",
    "we begin with the dirac belt trick @xcite .",
    "find a belt that is not too stiff .",
    "hold the buckle in your right hand and the other end in your left hand , so that the belt runs straight between your hands .",
    "now use your right hand to twist the buckle through two full turns as you would a right - handed screw , so that the belt twists about its length .",
    "it may appear that without simply turning the buckle back the other way , you wo nt be able to return the belt to its original , untwisted state .",
    "however , it can be done .",
    "we will describe one method below , and you may find your own way .",
    "the particular motions of your hands and arms are not important ; nor is the specific location of the belt in space .",
    "in fact , your arms are not technically part of the challenge , so you are allowed to pass the belt through  an arm .",
    "the key property of an untangling is that once you re done twisting up the belt , you can perform the untangling without changing the orientation at either end .    here",
    "is one way to do it : bring the ends together , pass the buckle around the part of the belt hanging down from your left hand , and then pull the belt straight again . during the maneuver",
    ", you will find that you momentarily need to hold the buckle with your left hand , so that your right arm may move to the other side of the belt ( in effect , the belt will pass through  your arm ) .",
    "if you pass the buckle in one direction around the hanging belt , the tangling will increase , but if you pass it in the other direction , the belt will come untangled .",
    "this process interpolates , in time , between a double - twisted belt and an untwisted one .",
    "we demonstrate the belt trick in the video ` belt-trick.mp4 ` from the supplementary materials accompanying this article ( also at @xcite ) .",
    "another untangling goes by the name of the waiter or feynman plate trick , or the indonesian or philippine candle dance @xcite .",
    "extend your right hand straight ahead of you , with your palm facing upwards ( the waiter holds a full plate of food ; the dancer a lighted candle ; a novice might choose a book ) .",
    "now twist your arm so that your palm , always staying horizontal , turns counterclockwise viewed from above . after turning about @xmath3 , you ll need to contort a bit to continue , but by pushing your elbow out to the right you can comfortably swing your hand beneath your armpit and continue to @xmath4 , at which point your hand will point out to the right and your arm will be twisted .",
    "you can now bring your arm forwards so that your hand is back in its original position , but your arm is awkwardly twisted with your elbow pointing upwards .",
    "maybe at this point you feel you have had enough , but we encourage you to continue by twisting your arm so that your hand continues its counterclockwise twisting , palm up . this time , your hand will pass over your head , and a rather natural motion will return it to its original position , with your arm now untwisted .",
    "we demonstrate the candle dance in the video ` candle-dance.mp4 ` from our supplementary materials ( also at @xcite ) .    during the dance ,",
    "your palm performs a double - twist while your shoulder remains stationary , and your arm interpolates between these two motions .",
    "the key property of the interpolation is that every point along your arm returns to its original orientation at the end of its motion .",
    "in contrast to the belt trick , here the interpolation between a double - twist and no twist is happening not in time , but with respect to distance along your arm .",
    "mathematically speaking , just what do these physical demonstrations tell us ? to tackle this , we will use the language of frames .",
    "a ( positive , orthonormal ) _ frame _ is a list of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors in @xmath5 which , when viewed as the columns of a @xmath6 matrix , lie in the group @xmath7 in particular , the standard basis vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 form a frame , the _ standard reference frame _ , whose matrix is the identity matrix @xmath11",
    ".    now begin again with your belt held straight from left to right , with both width and length horizontal .",
    "imagine a line drawn along the middle of the belt from one end to the other , and attach a copy of the standard reference frame at each point along this line , using the usual convention ( right - hand rule ) that the positive @xmath12- , @xmath13- , and @xmath14-axes point ( respectively ) toward the viewer , toward the right , and up .",
    "we view these frames as _",
    "tangential objects _ consisting of vectors attached to the belt , so that any physical positioning of the belt in @xmath2-space gives a path of frames , that is , a continuous map of an interval into @xmath0 . notice that we care not about the translational component of the positioning , but only about the rotational positioning of each frame .",
    "when you begin the trick with the belt twisted twice about its length , the frames spin twice about their second vector as you progress along the belt .",
    "a perfectly even double - twist yields the path of frames @xmath15{ccc}\\cos(2 t ) & 0 & -\\sin(2t)\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ \\sin(2 t ) & 0 & \\cos(2 t ) \\end{array } \\right ]   , \\label{rot}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 varies from @xmath17 at the left end to @xmath18 at the buckle .",
    "as you untangle the belt , at each time @xmath19 in the process the belt s position gives another path @xmath20 inside @xmath0 .",
    "the untangling process does not change the frames at the ends of the belt : @xmath21 .",
    "thus @xmath22 is in fact a _ loop _ in @xmath0 , based at @xmath11 .",
    "all in all , our untangling gives us a ( continuous ) _ based homotopy _ of loops in @xmath0 : @xmath23\\times\\lbrack0,2\\pi]\\longrightarrow so(3),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,h(s , t)=\\gamma_{s}(t).\\ ] ] since @xmath24 is the double - twist around the @xmath13-axis and @xmath25 is the constant loop at @xmath11 , @xmath26 is a _ based nullhomotopy _ of the double - twist .",
    "notice that if we had simply allowed you to _ untwist _ the belt by turning the buckle back with an unscrewing motion , the paths @xmath22 would have @xmath27 , but @xmath28 .",
    "we view the _ fundamental group _ @xmath29 as the group formed by based homotopy classes of loops of length @xmath18 , based at @xmath11 .",
    "recall that the group operation is given by concatenating two loops and then reparametrizing to form another loop of length @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the single - twist @xmath30 around the @xmath13-axis is given by the loop @xmath31{ccc}\\cos(t ) & 0 & -\\sin(t)\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ \\sin(t ) & 0 & \\cos(t ) \\end{array } \\right ]   , \\ ] ] and @xmath32 is the loop in ( [ rot ] ) .",
    "the belt trick , then , provides us with a physical proof that @xmath33 in @xmath29 .",
    "there is nothing special about our use of the @xmath13-axis as the rotation axis for defining @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , there is a continuous path in the unit sphere @xmath34 connecting any two unit vectors , and the family of single - twists around the vectors ( viewed as rotation axes ) in such a path gives a based homotopy between the single - twists around the vectors at the two ends of the path .",
    "thus we are free , up to based homotopy , to twist about any axis we like .    how does the candle dance translate into this mathematical formalism ?",
    "with our arm extended , ready to begin the dance , we attach the standard reference frame at every spot along a line running along the arm from palm to shoulder to neck . at every time during the dance , we obtain a path of frames along the arm , or equivalently a path in @xmath0 .",
    "but you will notice that these paths are not loops : the frame at your neck stays fixed at the standard reference frame , but the frame at your palm twists .",
    "on the other hand , fix a position on your arm , and consider the path of frames that appear at that spot on your arm as time varies . since your arm starts and ends in the same position , this gives a loop , based at the standard reference frame @xmath11 ! at your neck , this loop is constant at @xmath11 , while at your palm , this loop is the double - twist about the vertical axis .",
    "thus again we obtain a based nullhomotopy of a double - twist , this time about the @xmath14-axis .",
    "there is an important difference between our mathematical interpretations of the belt trick and the candle dance . while the twisted belt is untangled in time , the rotation of the candle is untangled along the arm .",
    "thus in our mathematical formalism for the belt trick , time represents the homotopy parameter @xmath19 , whereas for the candle dance , time functions as the loop parameter @xmath16 .",
    "there is a nice model of @xmath0 created from the closed unit ball in @xmath5 ( figure [ ball - model - description ] ) .",
    "a point in the ball can be represented by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a vector , and @xmath37   $ ] is a scalar .",
    "let @xmath35 correspond to rotation by @xmath38 radians about the axis determined by @xmath39 , counterclockwise while looking towards the origin from the tip of @xmath39 .",
    "this correspondence provides a homeomorphism between the ball and @xmath0 , provided we identify antipodal points on the boundary sphere , since rotation by @xmath40 is the same both clockwise and counterclockwise the corresponding linear transformation is a rotation of euclidean space around some axis through the origin by some angle .",
    "this was first proven by leonhard euler @xcite , and can be deduced from the spectral theorem in linear algebra ( * ? ? ?",
    "this quotient space is also homeomorphic to real projective @xmath2-space @xmath41 .",
    "ball-model-nullhomotopy.png    in the ball model , the double - twist around the axis @xmath36 is a loop based at the origin ( which corresponds to the identity in @xmath0 ) that traverses the diameter containing @xmath39 twice . figure [ ball - model - nullhomotopy ] shows how to separate ( tease apart ) these two traversals to create a based nullhomotopy .",
    "some of our original questions can be answered with the ball model .",
    "clearly the teasing - apart nullhomotopy lies inside the planar disk model  subspace that utilizes only two of the three coordinate directions for its rotation axes , and this subspace is homeomorphic to @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , apart from the double - twist diameter itself , each rotation in this subspace is utilized exactly once by the nullhomotopy .    however , despite these insights , the ball model is not sufficiently related to rotation geometry to answer our other questions , which involve how the rotations in a nullhomotopy of the double - twist move individual vectors around in @xmath2-space .",
    "single-twist-tipped.png    how might we create a mathematically satisfying based nullhomotopy of the double - twist out of simple rotation geometry ? we will combine two ideas .",
    "first , there is a relationship between counterclockwise ( ccw ) and clockwise ( cw ) single - twists as based loops in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , consider a ccw single - twist @xmath43 around the positive @xmath14-axis .",
    "now continuously tip the axis of the twist along a great circle until the axis is upside down ( figure [ single - twist - tipped ] ) .",
    "this provides a based homotopy between a ccw single - twist and a cw single - twist , both around the positive @xmath14-axis . from this",
    ", the theory of fundamental groups will assure us that a double - twist is nullhomotopic : @xmath44 while the latter homotopy is a standard construction for fundamental groups , and pasting the two homotopies together provides an untangling , it is inefficient and jerky .",
    "a second idea is to replace concatenation in the double - twist by a different point of view before deforming it .",
    "so far , we have been thinking of a double - twist as the concatenation and reparametrization of two single - twists , both around the same axis in the same rotation direction .",
    "suppose instead that for every parameter value @xmath16 we multiply  using the group structure of @xmath0 , i.e. , we compose the two rotations corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting path will , at @xmath16 , first rotate by @xmath16 , and then rotate again by @xmath16 with the same axial ray and rotation direction , for a total rotation of @xmath45 .",
    "observe : the result of multiplying the two single - twists pointwise in @xmath16 ( using the group structure of @xmath0 ) is exactly the same as concatenating and reparametrizing them .",
    "of course it is critical that the two single - twists are around the same axis .",
    "double-tip.png    we now combine these two ideas to create a homotopy @xmath46 ( figure [ double - tip ] ) .",
    "we begin at homotopy parameter value @xmath47 with the counterclockwise double - twist around the positive @xmath14-axis , reinterpreted now as the pointwise composition product of two ccw single - twists .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , we still use the composition product of two ccw single - twist loops as our loop ( recall that composition of rotations always produces another rotation , per euler ) , but we tip the axes of the two single - twist loops , and we tip them differently . for a given @xmath19 , we tip the first rotation axis leftward by @xmath19 radians ( in the plane @xmath48 ) from the positive @xmath14-axis toward the negative @xmath13-axis , and we tip the second rotation axis rightward by @xmath19 radians toward the positive @xmath13-axis .",
    "note that the result is always a based loop : the paths being multiplied are always based loops , so at @xmath49 or @xmath18 we are just composing the identity transformation with itself .    to see what our double - tipping homotopy @xmath46 is achieving ,",
    "consider what happens when @xmath19 reaches @xmath50 , at which stage we have the composition product of a ccw single - twist around the negative @xmath13-axis with a ccw single - twist around the positive @xmath13-axis .",
    "for each @xmath16 , we are composing two inverse transformations , so this is the identity transformation for every @xmath16 , and thus we have the constant loop based at the identity .",
    "so we stop at @xmath51 and declare victory .",
    "henceforth all nullhomotopies will be parametrized with @xmath19 ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath50 , rather than to @xmath52 , for easy comparison with our geometrically defined nullhomotopy @xmath46 .",
    "the quaternions are astonishingly useful for describing rotations in 3-space ( * ? ? ?",
    "we give just the bare essentials needed for our purposes .    as a vector space",
    "the _ quaternions _ are just @xmath53 , with elements @xmath54 written quaternionically as @xmath55 .",
    "real part _ is @xmath56 , the _ imaginary part _ is @xmath57 , and the _ conjugate _ is @xmath58 .",
    "the _ unit quaternions _ are those with euclidean norm one , the _ pure quaternions _ are those with zero real part , and _ real quaternions _ are those with zero imaginary part .",
    "the quaternions have an associative , noncommutative multiplication in which the real quaternions are central .",
    "this multiplication distributes over addition , and is determined by the formulas@xmath59 from which one obtains @xmath60 a quaternion times its conjugate yields the square of its norm , so quaternions have multiplicative inverses , and the inverse of a unit quaternion is its conjugate . the norm of a product is the product of the norms , so the unit quaternions , which constitute the unit sphere @xmath61 , are a group under multiplication .",
    "the quaternions act linearly on themselves as follows : @xmath62 is called the conjugation action of @xmath63 on @xmath64 .",
    "since real quaternions commute with all quaternions , scaling @xmath63 by a real quaternion leaves the conjugation unchanged , so the action on @xmath64 is captured entirely by unit quaternions @xmath63 , and henceforth we consider only action by these .",
    "even then , @xmath63 and its antipodal point @xmath65 still produce the same action on @xmath64 . for unit quaternions @xmath63 ,",
    "the conjugation formula @xmath62 becomes @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the conjugate of @xmath63 .",
    "an important , easily verified feature is that the pure quaternions are preserved under the conjugation action .",
    "we shall focus on these , since they are in clear correspondence with @xmath5 , with @xmath68 corresponding to the standard unit vectors along the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 coordinate axes ( respectively ) .",
    "so each @xmath69 in the unit quaternions @xmath61 produces , via conjugation on the pure quaternions , a linear transformation of @xmath5 . what linear transformations are produced ?",
    "if you are guessing that it is the rotations , you are correct , and the details seem like magic .    consider a unit quaternion @xmath63 . since it has norm one , it can be written ( almost ) uniquely in the form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath39 is a pure unit quaternion , i.e. , @xmath39 is a vector in @xmath34 .",
    "the only caveat to uniqueness is when @xmath72 , which causes @xmath39 to be irrelevant .",
    "this happens only when @xmath73 or @xmath18 , i.e. , when @xmath74 , in which cases the conjugation action is the identity transformation .",
    "now the following amazing fact tells us exactly how conjugations produce rotations .",
    "given a pure unit quaternion @xmath39 , conjugation by @xmath75 is the linear transformation that rotates @xmath5 around @xmath39 , by angle @xmath76 counterclockwise ( looking towards the origin from the tip of @xmath39 ) .",
    "you may enjoy confirming this yourself .",
    "@xmath77 is itself a pure unit quaternion precisely when the angle of rotation under conjugation is @xmath40 ( that is , when @xmath78 ) .",
    "we mentioned above that conjugation by @xmath63 and @xmath65 produce the same transformation , which can be effected in the correspondence of the theorem by negating @xmath39 and changing the angle @xmath76 to @xmath79 , yielding the same rotation described from the other end of the axis .",
    "note too that the quaternionic representation has @xmath80periodicity in @xmath76 , with alteration by @xmath18 effecting negation .",
    "it is clear from the formula that negation is the only way that two different unit quaternions can produce the same rotation .",
    "thus conjugation creates a smooth two - to - one covering map from the unit quaternions @xmath61 onto the space of rotations , i.e. , onto @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote this map sending @xmath63 to conjugation by @xmath63  by @xmath81 @xmath0 .",
    "one more superb feature of the double - covering @xmath82 will enable us to quaternionically compute  our geometrically defined double - tipping nullhomotopy @xmath46 .",
    "the homotopy was defined using composition of rotations , i.e. , the group structure for linear transformations , corresponding to matrix multiplication in @xmath0 . but recall that the unit quaternions @xmath61 form a group , under quaternion multiplication .",
    "is the map @xmath81 @xmath0 a group homomorphism ?",
    "yes , as seen from@xmath83    we need to compute the axes of rotation used in the double - tipping nullhomotopy @xmath46 .",
    "when we tip the unit vector @xmath84 on the positive @xmath14-axis by @xmath19 radians toward the negative @xmath13-axis ( whose unit vector is @xmath85 ) , this yields the unit vector @xmath86 , and similarly yields @xmath87 when we tip rightward toward the positive @xmath13-axis .",
    "our definition applies the leftward tipped rotation first , so according to the theorem and ( [ homomorphism ] ) we want the product @xmath88   \\cdot\\\\ &   \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\left [   \\cos\\left (   t/2\\right ) + \\sin\\left (   t/2\\right )   \\left (   -j\\sin s+k\\cos s\\right )   \\right ] \\\\ =   &   \\left (   1 - 2\\cos^{2}s\\sin^{2}\\left (   t/2\\right )   \\right )   + i\\left ( \\sin\\left (   2s\\right )   \\sin^{2}\\left (   t/2\\right )   \\right )   + k\\left (   \\cos s\\sin t\\right )   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a homotopy in the unit quaternions .",
    "we may conclude that our double - tipping nullhomotopy @xmath89 is conjugation by @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "the mapping @xmath89 into @xmath92 defined for @xmath93 and @xmath94 as conjugation on pure quaternions @xmath57 by the unit quaternion @xmath95 is a based nullhomotopy of the double - twist around @xmath84 .",
    "before proceeding , we note that to compute @xmath89 as a matrix by carrying out the conjugation requires calculating 27 types of terms , each involving up to triple products of @xmath68 , then collecting and simplifying , and produces entries in the 3 @xmath96 3 matrix that are sixth degree polynomials in sines and cosines of double , single , and half angles of @xmath19 and @xmath16 !",
    "the most striking feature of our formula for @xmath97 is that it has no @xmath98 component .",
    "so @xmath97 lands in the @xmath56-@xmath12-@xmath14 @xmath99-sphere , which we call @xmath100 ; equivalently , @xmath46 uses only rotation axes lying in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane.[multiblock footnote omitted ] while this can be proven from the double - tipping definition of @xmath46 via spherical geometry or linear algebra , the quaternionic formula tells us immediately .",
    "let @xmath101 be the subspace of @xmath0 whose rotation axes lie in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane . from the ball model",
    "we know that @xmath101 is diffeomorphic to the projective plane @xmath42 .",

[ c]cc &    we can get a sense for @xmath46 in terms of rotations by looking at graphs of its rotation axes and angles , which serve as coordinates for @xmath101 , aided by the fact that @xmath97 uses only axial directions with nonnegative @xmath12-coordinate ( cf .",
    "the formula for @xmath97 in [ quaternion - formula ] ) . indeed , if we let @xmath102 be the central angle in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane measured from the positive @xmath12-axis to the axis of rotation ( figure [ phi - theta - defs ] ) , then the formula for @xmath97 and the conjugation rotation theorem yield @xmath103 and similarly , the ccw rotation angle @xmath104 around this axis is @xmath105    figure [ phi - theta - graphs ] shows graphs for @xmath102 and @xmath104 on the domain rectangle of the homotopy @xmath46 .",
    "many features of @xmath46 can be understood by studying these graphs .",
    "the reader may find it interesting to analyze why one should conjecture therefrom that @xmath46 maps onto @xmath101 , and also that @xmath46 is one - to - one except for the requirements of a based nullhomotopy along the edges of the domain rectangle .",
    "additionally , one can consider how these graphs achieve a based nullhomotopy of the double - twist .",
    "any concern of a discontinuity or lack of smoothness in the middle of the double - twist can be assuaged by remembering that in @xmath0 the rotation axis is not well - defined at the identity , and that close to the identity , all rotation axes appear with small rotation amounts .",
    "the discussion immediately above suggests that the image of @xmath46 is all of @xmath101 , and indeed this is true for any based nullhomotopy landing in @xmath101 .",
    "any based nullhomotopy of the double - twist landing in @xmath101 must map onto @xmath101 .    if not",
    ", then it would map into @xmath106 , less a point , which is homeomorphic to a mbius strip , hence homotopy equivalent to a circle , with the single - twist as generator of its fundamental group .",
    "but the double - twist is not nullhomotopic in @xmath101 less the point , since @xmath107 .",
    "we have also conjectured from figure [ phi - theta - graphs ] that @xmath46 is one - to - one , except for the identifications required of a based nullhomotopy along the boundary of the rectangle .",

    "@xmath46 is one - to - one except as prescribed along the edges of the homotopy rectangle .",
    "this can be proven from the geometric double - tipping definition of @xmath46 via spherical geometry , but is more easily verified from the quaternionic formula for @xmath97 on its rectangular domain @xmath109 and @xmath110 , keeping in mind that @xmath111 , with @xmath82 identifying only negatives with each other , and noting that the @xmath112 component of @xmath97 is never negative .",
    "the details are straightforward using a few trigonometric identities , so we leave them to the reader .    rectangle-quotient.png    we can now topologically combine the surjective and largely one - to - one features of @xmath46 .",
    "a based nullhomotopy of a double - twist must map one edge of the rectangle twice around the single - twist in @xmath0 , and the other three edges to the identity transformation ( figure [ rectangle - quotient ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the map factors through the quotient space @xmath113 of the rectangle formed by collapsing three edges to a point and wrapping the remaining ( now circular ) edge twice around itself .",
    "@xmath46 induces a homeomorphism @xmath114 .",
    "hence @xmath113 is homeomorphic to @xmath42 .",
    "[ c]cc &    it is illustrative to use hemispheres of the @xmath61 covering @xmath0 to view from two very different perspectives how the lift @xmath97 behaves in the @xmath56-@xmath12-@xmath14 2-sphere @xmath100 . note that the image of @xmath100 under the double - covering @xmath82 is the subspace @xmath101 of @xmath115 .",
    "first , @xmath97 lands in the @xmath12-non - negative hemisphere of @xmath100 , and the covering map @xmath116 makes the antipodal identification on the @xmath56-@xmath14 equator ( left plot in figure [ hemispheres ] ) .",
    "the single - twist about the @xmath14-axis lifts to @xmath117 for @xmath94 , traversing half a circle ( so covering space theory shows that the single - twist can not be nullhomotopic ) .",
    "the double - twist lifts to @xmath118 for @xmath94 , and @xmath97 is a nullhomotopy of this great circle loop . in figure",
    "[ hemispheres ] , one sees @xmath97 drag this loop across the @xmath12-non - negative hemisphere to the quaternion @xmath52 .    for a second vantage point , and to compare with the tease - apart nullhomotopy of figure [ ball - model - nullhomotopy ] , we can instead view @xmath46 lifted to the @xmath56-non - negative hemisphere in @xmath100 , with antipodal identification on the @xmath12-@xmath14 equator ( right plot in figure [ hemispheres ] ) .",
    "the right plot is obtained from the left plot by rotating our view by @xmath119 , and then shifting the @xmath56-negative image points antipodally to make them visible . in the right plot , the double - twist runs twice vertically through the middle , as opposed to the left plot , where the double - twist runs around the boundary .",
    "the right plot is satisfyingly similar to the teasing - apart nullhomotopy in the disk model of figure [ ball - model - nullhomotopy ] .",
    "it is interesting to contemplate how the extremely different plots in figure [ hemispheres ] are just two hemispherical views of the same nullhomotopy in @xmath101 .",
    "a close study of the second plot can match it with the rotation geometry information in the graphs of @xmath102 and @xmath104 shown earlier .",
    "the theorems above tell us that , except for the double - twist itself , @xmath46 utilizes each rotation in @xmath101 exactly once . but",
    "how then do the rotations in @xmath101 ( those with axes in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane ) move individual vectors ?    as an example , at the very center of the hemisphere depicted on the left in figure [ hemispheres ] , and at the right edge of the hemisphere depicted on the right , lies the quaternion @xmath112 , so for just a single @xmath120 ( actually the center of the domain rectangle ) the nullhomotopy @xmath46 conjugates frame vectors by @xmath112 , resulting in rotation by @xmath40 around @xmath112 ( recall the remark after the conjugation rotation theorem ) .",
    "so the standard frame is turned upside down , with @xmath84 sent to @xmath121 , @xmath98 sent to @xmath85 , and @xmath112 fixed . clearly there is no other way to send @xmath84 to @xmath121 using an axis from the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane .",
    "so this actually proves that @xmath84 is sent to @xmath121 exactly once during the entire nullhomotopy @xmath46 , and also illustrates the reversal phenomenon described in the introduction .",
    "on the other hand , we see that @xmath98 is sent to @xmath85 infinitely often by @xmath46 , since rotation by @xmath40 around any axis in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane does so .",

    "two striking observations stand out .",
    "first , the map @xmath132 appears to be surjective .",
    "second , it appears to be mostly one - to - one , except to the hinge point @xmath131 .",
    "we will see that @xmath131 is obtained from @xmath64 by negating its @xmath13-coordinate .",
    "of course no continuous map @xmath133 could be surjective and entirely one - to - one , since @xmath101 is homeomorphic to @xmath134 , not to @xmath34 .",
    "we now show that @xmath124 collapses @xmath101 to @xmath34 efficiently , by putting all the non - injectivity on to the single vector @xmath131 .",

    "the inverse image of @xmath131 under @xmath135 is an essential embedded circle is a hopf map , and its circular fibers are the 2-fold covers of the circular fibers of @xmath135 . here",
    "we are seeing that exactly one of those fibers lies in @xmath101 , while the others each intersect it transversally in singletons . ] in @xmath101 .",
    "first we prove the onto and one - to - one claims .",

    "if on the other hand this perpendicular bisector is the @xmath12-@xmath14 equator , then @xmath137 , being the reflection of @xmath64 across the perpendicular bisector , is @xmath131 , and there is again no claim about injectivity .",
    "now we consider the inverse image of @xmath131 under @xmath125 .",

    "the axes of the rotations carrying @xmath64 to @xmath131 all lie on @xmath144 .",
    "where @xmath143 intersects @xmath144 , a rotation by @xmath40 will carry @xmath64 to @xmath131 , and for every other axis along @xmath144 there is one rotation carrying @xmath64 to @xmath131 , with rotation angle varying continuously with the axis . in the one case where @xmath64 and @xmath131 are antipodal ( @xmath145 ) the rotation angle remains as @xmath40 throughout .",
    "otherwise the rotation angle varies monotonically to an extreme when the rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane containing @xmath143 , then returns to @xmath40 as the axis completes one full flip . in all cases the inverse image is homeomorphic to a circle in @xmath101 , and it corresponds to a homotopically essential loop , since its lift to the universal cover @xmath34 joins antipodal points in @xmath34 , the set @xmath146 of transformations in @xmath0 carrying @xmath64 to @xmath137 is an essential circle .",
    "this can also be seen group - theoretically , since this set of transformations is a coset of the subgroup @xmath147 fixing @xmath64 , and @xmath147 is just the loop of rotations with axis @xmath64 .",

    "since @xmath101 is diffeomorphic to @xmath42 , we may consider @xmath113 with the differentiable structure making @xmath151 a diffeomorphism .",
    "of course @xmath125 is also smooth .",
    "both @xmath124 and @xmath152 have nonzero mod two degree as smooth maps between differentiable @xmath99-manifolds .",
    "mod two degree may be computed as the mod two cardinality of the inverse image of any regular value @xcite .",
    "regular values are dense ( sard s theorem ) , so we may choose a regular value @xmath148 . from the theorem above",
    ", the inverse image of @xmath137 is a singleton .",
    "the next result relates arbitrary based nullhomotopies to @xmath46 .",
    "any two based nullhomotopies of the double - twist in @xmath0 are homotopic through based nullhomotopies of the double - twist .",
    "construct a map from the boundary of a box to @xmath0 , having the two given nullhomotopies on opposite faces , and the boundary requirements of based nullhomotopies of the double - twist on the edges of the slices of the box parallel to these faces . since the boundary of the box is homeomorphic to @xmath34 , this map from the boundary to @xmath0",
    "can be filled in continuously on the interior of the box provided the second homotopy group of @xmath0 is trivial .",
    "it is , since @xmath61 is a double cover of @xmath0 , and @xmath61 has trivial second homotopy group .",
    "now the maps on the slices of the filled - in box , parallel to the two opposite faces , provide the desired homotopy between the two original nullhomotopies .",
    "we now prove that every based nullhomotopy of the double - twist must send every vector in every direction to achieve the untangling .",
    "let @xmath26 be a based nullhomotopy of the double - twist in @xmath108 .",
    "for all vectors @xmath153 , there exist @xmath19 and @xmath16 such that @xmath154 .    the slices of a homotopy between @xmath26 and @xmath46 ,",
    "as given by the theorem above , create a homotopy between @xmath155 and @xmath151 as maps from @xmath113 to @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath156 is homotopic to @xmath152 , so from the corollary above , @xmath157 has nonzero mod two degree as a continuous map between differentiable @xmath99-manifolds ( because @xmath158 degree is a homotopy invariant @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath157 must be onto , as non - surjective maps have degree zero .",
    "since @xmath159 , this completes the proof .    with a bit more work , one can actually show that this theorem holds true for arbitrary nullhomotopies of the double - twist , based or not .",
    "the key point is that the boundary requirements of an unbased nullhomotopy still provide a factorization through @xmath42 ( using a somewhat different model from @xmath113 ) .",

    "we can watch the hand rotate twice keeping the candle upright , tracing out the double rotation around the vertical axis . as @xmath19 progresses the movies slowly trivialize .",

    "these beautiful and fascinating features are best seen using the megl program mentioned above , which has an optional contrail feature , allowing one to view moving contrails that follow individually the paths traversed by either the fingers , thumb , or candle , each of which exhibits dramatically different behavior .",
    "* the fingers should point directly away ( to @xmath162 ) often ( since @xmath162 is its own hinge ) and in every other direction exactly once . to achieve this the contrail path followed by the fingers starts as a double cover of the equator , which unfolds to a figure eight .",

    "* the candle must point in every non - upright direction exactly once during the interior of the homotopy ( since @xmath84 is its own hinge ) ; for instance , by referring to the frozen image grid , you can pinpoint exactly when the candle is upside down . to achieve this overall behavior , the contrail path followed by the candle starts as a tiny cardiod , which wraps around the sphere as the nullhomotopy progresses , eventually contracting to a cusp through thin - petioled leaves .",
    "the cardiod - like behavior can be deduced from the graphs in figure [ phi - theta - graphs ] .",
    "since the movies interpolate between a double rotation movie and an entirely stationary movie , one could hope that each successive movie is a relaxed  version of the one before .",
    "this is nicely seen by viewing the computer animations .",

    "once you are convinced that each animation looks like a relaxed  version of the previous one , then the mental homotopy interpolation is a success .",
    "this will prepare you to perform the entire phenomenon with your body .",
    "in this section , we will teach you how to perform the motions depicted in our movies with your hand .",
    "we refer to the hand motions for each movie as a _",
    "wave_. one might worry that our arms are not sufficiently flexible to control the required hand motions , but the most physically demanding wave is the first one in the homotopy ( namely a double rotation of the hand about the vertical ) and this is already performed by the candle dance .    recall that when we first described the candle dance , we observed that the movement of the arm contains all the information for an untangling , but that information is hidden in the intricate motions of our wrist , elbow , and shoulder joints , and seems inaccessible .",
    "our goal is to display the untangling entirely with hand motions , as shown in our animations , with the arm now serving only to control the hand .",
    "thus the candle dance serves only to demonstrate the first movie in our animations of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we should hope that since the nullhomotopy relaxes a double rotation to no rotation at all , the subsequent movies will become easier to perform .    at this point",
    "the reader should try performing the sequence of movies appearing in our animations ` doubletip-nullhomotopy.mp4 ` or in the displayed grid of frozen images .",
    "our best advice for learning how to wave the movies is to pay close attention to the embedding of your hand halfway through each movie",
    ". this should allow the rest of each movie to flow naturally . in the video",
    "` waving.mp4 ` from our supplementary materials ( also at @xcite ) we lead you through this learning process , or you may consult the following paragraph . and in the video `",
    "simultaneous-waving.mp4 ` we demonstrate all the waving movies in synchrony .    for instance , consider the second movie in our series , immediately following the double rotation .",
    "if you perform the double rotation ( candle dance ) without sufficient limberness of arm , you will probably not manage to keep your palm perfectly horizontal , especially in the middle of the movie , when this requires the greatest contortion .",
    "our second movie displays just such a relaxed candle dance : the hand falls an eighth of a turn short of horizontal in the middle of the movie . our advice , then , is to use the fact that in the middle of each wave , your fingers should point directly away from you , and the embeddings of your hand at the middle of the successive movies should rotate once clockwise ( from your point of view ) around the axis pointing directly toward you .",
    "that is , in the @xmath164-th wave ( @xmath165 ) , aim for your hand to be positioned , halfway through the wave , with the fingers pointing away and your hand rotated @xmath166 of a turn clockwise around the axis pointing directly toward you ( as measured from its initial palm - up position with thumb pointing to the right ) .",
    "this rotational positioning of the hand halfway through the waves can be seen by looking across the middle row of the frozen images grid ( and can be gleaned from the graphs in figure [ phi - theta - graphs ] ) .    to perfect your motions , match them with the behavior of @xmath162 , @xmath98 , @xmath84 ( the reference positions of your fingers , thumb , and imaginary candle ) discussed in the previous section .",

    "<S> it has long been known to mathematicians and physicists that while a full rotation in three - dimensional euclidean space causes tangling , two rotations can be untangled . </S>",
    "<S> formally , an untangling is a based nullhomotopy of the double - twist loop in the special orthogonal group of rotations . we study a particularly simple , </S>",
    "<S> geometrically defined untangling procedure , leading to new conclusions regarding the minimum possible complexity of untanglings . </S>",
    "<S> we animate and analyze how our untangling operates on frames in 3space , and teach readers in a video how to wave the nullhomotopy with their hands . </S>"
