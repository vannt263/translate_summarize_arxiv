    "the crust model follows the changes to the composition of an accreted fluid element and the associated energy deposition and neutrino emission through the outer crust of an accreting neutron star using a full nuclear reaction network .",
    "the use of a full reaction network is important because the interplay of electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs with subsequent reactions can significantly affect the cooling rates .",
    "there are also a few cases where urca shells for two subsequent electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs overlap .",
    "the temperature was kept constant at a fiducial value . with this approach ,",

    "is determined from our reaction network integration ; it is proportional to the mass fraction @xmath40 of the relevant electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pair and scales with temperature as @xmath20 .",
    "this temperature scaling@xcite is valid for @xmath28 .",
    "most electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs listed in table  [ tab_top ] have @xmath84 , and of the exceptions , most have @xmath21 of a few tens of kev , which is indistinguishable from @xmath85 within model uncertainties . in the absence of more detailed experimental information the assumptions @xmath84 and @xmath86 over all relevant temperatures are therefore reasonable .",
    "the only exceptions are the @xmath9-decays of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , for which the lowest transitions are predicted to have @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "both @xmath9-decays are part , however , of a secondary electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pair that only contributes weakly to the neutrino emissivity in the respective mass chain .    to explore the full range of possible compositions@xcite and to identify all possible electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs that may be activated in neutron star crusts , we investigated 87 different initial compositions , each consisting of a single nuclear species with mass number @xmath4 , where @xmath4 ranges from 20 to 106 .",
    "this approach is justified in the outer crust , where electron captures and @xmath0 decays are the only reactions and each @xmath4 chain can be considered independently . in the present work we limit the calculations to the outer crust , and stop the evolution once neutron capture and emission begin to change @xmath4 of the composition .",
    "the types of reactions occurring may then depend on the exact initial composition .",
    "we find that reactions changing @xmath4 typically occur when the neutron mass fraction becomes larger than @xmath91 .",
    "a test calculation with x - ray burst ashes shows no evidence for additional strong urca shells in the inner crust where the neutron mass fraction exceeds @xmath91 .",
    "for regular x - ray burst ashes@xcite we find that the electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs @xmath46-@xmath47 , @xmath92-@xmath93 , and @xmath94-@xmath95 dominate and contribute roughly equally to the cooling rate , with additional contributions from the @xmath96-@xmath97 and @xmath98-@xmath99pairs .",
    "we assume that the isotopic abundances in the neutron star crust are identical as those produced in the burst and neglect any phase separation@xcite and mixing in the liquid layer@xcite that occurs where the crust solidifies .",
    "obviously , the cooling rate will be sensitive to the x - ray burst nuclear physics that determines the relative proportions of @xmath100 , 33 , 55 , 56 , and 65 material in the burst ashes .",
    "superbursts are predicted to produce ashes with a smaller compositional spread , dominated by @xmath101@xcite . in",
    "this case cooling is dominated by the @xmath46-@xmath47electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pair , with a 10% contribution from a small @xmath102 admixture triggering the @xmath92-@xmath93pair .",
    "to determine the impact of urca shell cooling on superburst ignition , we compute the steady - state crust temperature profile by integrating the relativistic stellar structure equations for temperature and luminosity@xcite over the crust .",
    "the integration does not resolve the individual thin electron capture layers , but instead smooths out the heating and urca shell cooling over a numerically resolvable thickness .",
    "full details of the code , along with the equation of state , thermal conductivity , and thermal neutrino emissivities , are described in ref .  .",
    "the core and envelope temperatures are taken to match those used in ref .  .",
    "the thermal conductivity is computed from the formula appropriate for a crust with an amorphous lattice structure .",
    "this low thermal conductivity causes a steep temperature gradient , and hence high temperatures , in the crust .",
    "this model , without any urca shell cooling , serves as a baseline .",
    "it is similar to the hottest crust models presented in ref .  .",
    "a steadily accreting neutron star will relax to this thermal profile within a few thermal diffusion timescales , which is of order years@xcite .",
    "we then add a cooling source term to the neutrino emissivity , with a luminosity appropriate for a superburst ash mixture ( see tab .",
    "[ tab_top ] ) , and allow the crust to numerically relax to a steady - state thermal profile .",
    "the shell cooling results in a dramatically lower temperature in the outer crust ( extended data figure  [ f.crust_temps ] ) .",
    "for this accretion rate , the neutrino luminosity of the shell is 33% ( 23% ) of the total nuclear heating luminosity generated in the deep crust for the hfb-21 ( frdm ) mass model . the conductive flux in the layer above the urca shell , and hence the temperature gradient , is greatly reduced . for the run using the hfb-21 mass model ,",
    "the luminosity in this layer is negative , so that a temperature inversion develops .",
    "the urca shell effectively reduces the thermal flux reaching the @xmath103-rich layer from the deep crust . as a result",
    ", the high temperatures necessary to ignite @xmath103  can not be the result of deep crustal heating , even under the best of circumstances .",
    "the urca shell cooling process depends strongly on the transition strengths of the electron capture and @xmath9-decay processes within an electron - capture/@xmath0-decaypair to low lying states , sometimes including the ground state .",
    "it is therefore closely linked to the level structure of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "this structure depends on nuclear shape .",
    "it is unusual for spherical neutron - rich nuclei to exhibit strong electron capture or @xmath9-decay to very low - lying daughter states .",
    "on the other hand , deformed nuclei have a significantly altered single - particle structure as the non - spherical shape splits the highly degenerate spherical levels into a large number of doubly degenerate levels spaced more uniformly and densely in the vicinity of the fermi surface ( extended data figure  [ fig_nilsson ] ) .",
    "this results in a large number of low - lying energy levels in deformed nuclei , and in particular in odd - a nuclei",
    ". therefore strong , allowed transitions to low - energy daughter states are much more likely .",
    "this effect of deformation in our qrpa model has been demonstrated previously and agrees well with experimental data @xcite^,^@xcite .",
    "the effect is mainly responsible for the high cooling rates found in this work and is the reason why most of the strong electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs are found in regions of the nuclear chart where large deformations are predicted .",
    "our phase space approximation used in the calculation of electron capture rates and @xmath0 decay rates provides an accuracy for the resulting neutrino luminosity of 20% .",
    "in addition there are significant nuclear physics uncertainties .",
    "the quasi particle random phase approximation method used to calculate the strengths of individual electron capture and @xmath0 transitions has significant uncertainties when predicting the strength of individual transitions at low excitation energy@xcite .",
    "however , it is the only available global approach that can be applied to all nuclei of relevance . for 5 electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs in table  [ tab_top ] , @xmath104-@xmath105 , @xmath96-@xmath97 , @xmath94-@xmath95 , @xmath106-@xmath107 , and @xmath107- @xmath108 , there are experimental data available on the @xmath19-value for the ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0 decay .",
    "comparison with the theoretical prediction indicates an average deviation of about a factor of 3 .",
    "an exception is the @xmath96-@xmath97 pair , where the experimental limit of @xmath109 for the ground state @xmath0 decay of @xmath97 differs by more than two orders of magnitude from the theoretical prediction of @xmath110 .",
    "this is not unexpected since the experimental data indicate@xcite that this electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pair lies on different sides of the border around the so - called island of inversion , where ground state configurations of nuclei change drastically with small changes in proton or neutron number because of large changes in deformation . with @xmath96 lying outside of the island of inversion , and @xmath97 lying inside ,",
    "the states near the fermi surface , if expanded in a spherical basis , are dominated by different major shells , which reduces the transition strength dramatically .",
    "our model assumes similar shapes for parent and daughter nuclei , which is a good approximation for most nuclei , though not in this exceptional case .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath96-@xmath97 pair does not play a critical role in our study , and the uncertainties of a factor of 3 found for the other electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs can be regarded as a more typical indicator of the theoretical model uncertainty .",
    "further measurements of ground state @xmath19-values for neutron rich nuclei , especially for the electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs listed in table  [ tab_top ] , would further reduce nuclear physics uncertainties .",
    "nuclear masses are also not known experimentally for many of the electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs and need to be predicted with nuclear mass models . to test the dependence on nuclear masses , we performed calculations using the frdm mass model@xcite instead of the hfb-21 mass model@xcite .",
    "overall the results are comparable and cooling rates for most electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs agree within 20% .",
    "one important exception is the @xmath46-@xmath47 pair , which does not form an effective electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pair when the frdm masses are used .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath12 values predicted by frdm have a much larger staggering between odd and even charge numbers , for a given @xmath4 , than those predicted by the hfb-21 mass model ( @xmath111 for frdm versus @xmath112 for hfb-21 ) .",
    "since the predicted excitation energy of the transition from @xmath47 to @xmath113 is only @xmath114 , a model using the frdm masses finds that electron capture on @xmath47 occurs as soon as electron capture on @xmath46becomes energetically possible .",
    "this strongly limits cycling in the @xmath46-@xmath47 electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pair and reduces the neutrino luminosity from a crust composed of superburst ashes by roughly 90% compared to a calculation using the hfb-21 mass model .",
    "measurements at radioactive beam facilities of the masses of @xmath113 and @xmath47 and the excitation energy of the allowed transitions are necessary to identify the strength of the cooling in superburst ashes .",
    "other larger changes when calculating cooling rates with the frdm mass model are the electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs @xmath115-@xmath116 and @xmath49-@xmath55 that are reduced by more than a factor of 2 . on the other hand , the @xmath97-@xmath117 pair becomes a very strong cooling pair , on par with @xmath104-@xmath105 .    despite the considerable theoretical uncertainties in predicting the strength of individual electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs , our main conclusions are robust owing to the steep temperature dependence of the cooling rate and the fact that a realistic composition will be spread over a range of mass numbers and",
    "will therefore activate a range of electron - capture/@xmath0-decay  pairs ."

    "<S> the presence of a strong `` heat sink '' at that depth , however , will prevent the deeper layers from rising in temperature and will , therefore , force the observed light curve to decay faster than expected over timescales of roughly one day . </S>",
    "<S> current superburst observations on this timescale are rare and provide data of limited quality@xcite , but a dedicated program of superburst follow - up observations with current instrumentation could address this problem </S>",
    "<S> . detailed simulations , which are beyond the scope of this paper , are required to quantify the effect of urca shell cooling on superburst light curves . </S>",

    "<S> , the rate of urca shell cooling does not scale with accretion rate , but rather depends only on temperature . </S>",
    "<S> cooling will therefore continue in transiently accreting neutron stars once accretion has turned off , and might affect observations of the cooling crusts in the hottest of these systems , such as xte  j1701@xmath33462,@xcite as the urca shell neutrino cooling rate is comparable to typical photon luminosities of @xmath34 for typical initial crust temperatures of @xmath35 .    </S>",
