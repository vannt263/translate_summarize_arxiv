    "it is well known that galaxies are formed in highly dense regions of dark matter , termed dark haloes . according to the @xmath5cdm model , the large - scale structure of the universe seen today originated from small density fluctuations of the dark matter in the early universe .",
    "galaxies are thought to have formed from cool gases trapped in the gravitational wells of the dark matter .",
    "galaxy clustering is one of the most important keys to unveiling the galaxy evolution through cosmic time .",
    "the clustering amplitude of galaxies increases monotonically with the halo mass ; i.e. , more massive dark haloes are more strongly clustered .",
    "many previous studies have revealed that galaxy clustering , which provides a measure of the dark halo mass , depends on the physical properties of galaxies ; i.e. , the brightness @xcite , the star - formation rate ( sfr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , morphology @xcite , and colour @xcite .",
    "because of recent galaxy selection methods that allow us to obtain large numbers of distant galaxies effectively , such as the dropout method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the multi - colour selection method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to investigate the clustering evolution of galaxies with different physical properties to gain insight into galaxy evolution .",
    "although galaxy formation reflects the distribution of dark matter , the complex baryonic processes that occur within dark haloes mean that galaxy evolution is not straightforward .",
    "the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a powerful theoretical approach that relates the galaxy distribution to the dark matter distribution .",
    "the hod formalism describes the galaxy distribution within the host dark halo by characterizing them from the perspective of the probability distribution @xmath6 that a halo of virial mass @xmath7 contains @xmath8 galaxies with specific physical properties , such as colour or galaxy type .",
    "one of the advantages of the hod formalism is that the hod parameters have explicit physical meanings ; this enables us to easily interpret the relationship between the galaxies and the host haloes .",
    "the largest difference between the hod framework and other galaxy  halo correspondence methods , such as the abundance matching method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is that the hod model is based on a more realistic halo model and does not assume a one - to - one correspondence between galaxies and haloes .",
    "it is known that different types of galaxy pairs contribute to the two - point angular correlation function ( acf ) between large - angular scales and small - angular scales . at the small - angular scale ,",
    "galaxy clustering is contributed to mainly by galaxy pairs that are located in the same dark halo , referred to as the `` 1-halo term '' , whereas galaxy clustering at the large - angular scale is attributed to galaxy pairs that reside in different dark haloes , referred to as the `` 2-halo term '' .",
    "these two components result in different power - law slopes of the acf at the two angular scales ; these characteristics are well described using the hod formalism .",

    "moreover , @xcite found that the acf of red galaxies has a strong clustering strength and steeper slope than that of blue galaxies , and faint red galaxies exhibit remarkably strong clustering at the small scale , which is comparable to the most luminous red galaxies . in the distant universe ,",
    "@xcite calculated the mean dark halo mass and the expected number of galaxies within a dark halo at @xmath2 , and discussed an evolutionary relation between the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath2 and the old passively evolving galaxies ( opegs ) at @xmath13 .",

    "however , there have been few hod analyses of @xmath0 galaxies , due to difficulties in collecting a large sample of galaxies .",
    "wide - field near infra - red ( nir ) observations are required for a large sample of @xmath0 galaxies ; however , this is difficult because of the poor sky transparency and the limitations of the physical size of nir detectors .",

    "this characteristic dark halo mass is determined by the equilibrium of the suppression mechanism that star - formation becomes equal between the shallow gravitational potential wells for less - massive dark haloes and agn feedback , and high virial temperature of massive dark haloes .",

    "the hod formalism is based upon a halo model , and it enables us to calculate the dark halo mass precisely , as well as to determine the distribution of sgzks in their host dark haloes ; this enables us to connect sgzks to their ancestors / descendants .",

    "the limiting magnitude of our @xmath1-selected catalogue was @xmath53 , which corresponds to a 70@xmath54 completeness cut .",
    "differences in the filter set used for our @xmath55 and the original vlt-@xmath56 filters should be considered when selecting galaxies , to ensure the same properties as in previous bzk studies .",

    "following these corrections , we applied the bzk selection method ( termed here the `` gzk selection '' method ) to obtain sgzks . the original bzk selection criterion proposed by @xcite",

    "the number counts of all @xmath1-selected galaxies and sgzks were in good agreement with the results of previous studies .",
    "the derived acf amplitude exhibited a clear @xmath1-band luminosity dependence , showing that more luminous sgzks were more strongly clustered than fainter sgzks ; this trend had been inferred by previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , with our acfs , an excess from a power law at the small angular scale was clearly seen because of the high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , due to the large number of samples .",
    "our correlation lengths showed excellent agreement with the results of almost all previous studies over all magnitude ranges .",
    "there was a tendency for bright sgzks to exhibit stronger clustering than faint sgzks , as was the case with the amplitude of the acfs .",
    "we also investigated the relationship between clustering strength and the stellar mass of the sgzks , which was consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the dark halo masses were calculated by comparing the effective bias derived from the correlation length with the halo model based on @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the hod framework allows for the formation of multiple galaxies within a single dark halo , which can explain the excess from a power law in the observed acfs at the small angular scale ( 1-halo term ) , corresponding to less than the virial radius . at the large angular scale , especially at scales larger than the virial radius ( 2-halo term ) , the acf is contributed to by galaxy pairs residing in different dark haloes ; i.e. , the acf becomes the simple power law .",

    "the origin of this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "one possible explanation is that the halo model can not describe the observed acf at the scale of the virial radius .",

    "we note that the definitions of the mean halo masses with these two methods differ slightly .",
    "the mean halo mass from the hod analysis is weighted by the number of galaxies in a dark halo , which tends to make @xmath73 larger than the estimate from the acf ; that is because hod formalism does not assume a one - to - one correspondence , as also mentioned in @xcite .",

    "@xcite reported little difference between data obtained using the two methods .",
    "however , this may be caused by large error bars in their hod analysis .",

    "@xcite showed that the halo mass of galaxies with luminosity @xmath11 was weakly dependent on the luminosity of the galaxy , whereas the halo mass of galaxies with a luminosity @xmath12 increased sharply with increasing luminosity .",
    "this is because a large fraction of baryons within a massive dark halo tend to form satellite galaxies that are below the luminosity threshold , and then accrete to the central galaxy .",
    "@xcite also found that the clustering amplitude of galaxies with luminosity @xmath11 increased slowly , whereas the clustering amplitude increased sharply for @xmath129 , showing that @xmath83 and @xmath72 had a similar dependence on the luminosity .",
    "moreover , @xcite , using the same hod model with varying @xmath85 and @xmath86 , reported a similar relation for luminous red galaxies at @xmath130 , showing that the dark halo mass of the low - mass halo is proportional to the luminosity of the central galaxy @xmath131 , whereas high - mass dark haloes followed the relation @xmath132 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mh - l ] , our data show different slopes for the bright sgzks and faint sgzks , although the slope of the power law was somewhat uncertain because we have only three data points , which makes it impossible to determine the turning magnitude ; this trend is also seen in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results for high - mass sgzks exhibit a similar behaviour to the high - mass low-@xmath15 galaxies @xcite , indicating that baryons are less likely to accrete into the central galaxies at @xmath0 , which is also seen for low-@xmath15 galaxies .",
    "@xcite inferred that baryons are likely to be consumed to form faint satellite galaxies rather than accrete into bright central galaxies .",
    "our result of a massive dark halo indicates that the trend may be true , even in the @xmath0 universe .",
    "@xmath72 , representing the threshold dark halo mass of the central galaxy formation , are larger at @xmath0 than @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that galaxies at higher-@xmath15 can be formed only in very massive dark haloes , whereas less - massive dark haloes can form galaxies at lower-@xmath15 , which is known as downsizing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our result implies that satellite galaxies are less likely to be formed in the high-@xmath15 universe than in the local universe ; also , the hod mass parameters show the same luminosity dependence as that for the local universe .",
    "it should be noted that the galaxy populations of this work and @xcite are not completely identical ; @xcite used volume - limited sdss galaxy samples ( @xmath133 ) , whereas our sample is confined to the star - forming galaxy at @xmath0 .    ; and the threshold mass that can possess a galaxy within a dark halo , @xmath72 .",

    "this result may be expected , because galaxies with a higher sfr at larger redshifts produce a considerably greater number of stars and evolve into galaxies with larger stellar mass at smaller redshifts .",

    "<S> we present the results of an halo occupation distribution ( hod ) analysis of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained high - quality angular correlation functions based on a large sgzk sample , which enabled us to carry out the hod analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the mean halo mass and the hod mass parameters are found to increase monotonically with increasing @xmath1-band magnitude , suggesting that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive dark haloes . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity dependence of the hod mass parameters was found to be the same as in the local universe ; however , the masses were larger than in the local universe over all ranges of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that galaxies at @xmath0 tend to form in more massive dark haloes than in the local universe , a process known as downsizing . by analysing the dark halo mass evolution using the extended press  </S>",
    "<S> schechter formalism and the number evolution of satellite galaxies in a dark halo , we find that faint lyman break galaxies at @xmath2 could evolve into the faintest sgzks @xmath3 at @xmath0 and into the milky - way - like galaxies or elliptical galaxies in the local universe , whereas the most luminous sgzks @xmath4 could evolve into the most massive systems in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar - to - halo mass ratio ( shmr ) of the sgzks was found to be consistent with the prediction of the model , except that the shmr of the faintest sgzks was smaller than the prediction at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy may be attributed that our samples are confined to star - forming galaxies .    </S>",
