    "all these gates represent a generic behavior in the entire set of two - qubit unitary quantum gates , but it is hardly possible to distinguish out of them a single gate with some special properties .",
    "[ fig : pr22 ]",
    "among all two  qubit gates represented by unitary matrices of size @xmath95 , one may distinguish so  called _ perfect entanglers _ , which can produce from a product state a maximally entangled , bell - like state .",

    "@xmath250 the condition reads @xcite @xmath251    in the latter work the authors have shown that the relative volume of the set of perfect entanglers is equal to @xmath252 .",
    "however , they used the uniform measure in the @xmath70dimensional space of the vectors representing the information content ( or rather its relevant part , called weyl chamber ) , which does not corresponds the natural haar measure on the set of unitary matrices .    in this section",
