    "a similar but opposite effect is seen in reference star 2 ( although not ref .",

    "the 4@xmath2 jump in j at ajd 2001.51 is not accompanied by any similar feature in the reference stars or reference level so could be intrinsic to sdss1203 , although it is neither large nor that statistically significant .",
    "the j dip at ajd 2002.63 , on the other hand , _ is _ accompanied by a dip in the reference level ( but not the reference stars ) .",
    "this could be due to a colour dependent variation in the extinction ( see section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "we also note that sdss1203 appeared to be brighter in  at the beginning of night 17 , an effect which is marginally significant and can not obviously be reduced to the behaviour of the reference stars or reference level .",

    "[ sdss1203_all ] shows no long lasting colour correlated variations .",
    "moreover , the range of @xmath4 , given by @xmath5 , is no larger than for the reference stars ( table [ relphot ] ) .",
    "the j/  correlation coefficient , @xmath6 , is slightly larger for sdss1203 than the other stars ( @xmath6=0.34 against @xmath6=0.070.24 for the reference stars ) , although it is still small .",
    "we conclude that there is no good evidence for variability in sdss1203 from these data .",
    "sdss1203 was found to be variable in the i - band by bailer - jones & mundt @xcite , primarily due to an apparent brightening of the object over a duration of one to two hours .",
    "as far as we could tell , those data were taken under good observing conditions near culmination of the object ( i.e.very small airmass changes ) so we do not believe that result was an artifact due to the earth s atmosphere .",
    "* 2m1439 * as with sdss1203 , this object shows more significant variability than any of the reference stars for both j and according to the  test applied to all data .",
    "however , its @xmath4 values , as well as the correlations between j and  and j and j@xmath7  are no larger than for some of the reference stars .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ 2m1439_all ] that the  light curve of 2m1439 dims by 0.14 mag over a period of five hours from ajd 1992.4 on night 4 .",
    "although no such trend ( or opposite trend ) is seen in the light curve of the reference stars individually , the opposite trend is seen in the reference level with a scale of 0.4 magnitudes , indicating that all of the reference stars increased in brightness ( fig.[2m1439multi_lc ] ) .",
    "this coincides with the field rising  from an airmass of 2.6 to 1.05  so is presumably just due to the usual decrease in extinction with decreasing airmass .",
    "however , while the reference stars brighten by 0.4 mag , 2m1439 brightens by only 0.26 mag .",
    "this is possible if the extinction coefficient has a strong gradient across the  band and if 2m1439 has a different flux gradient from the reference stars . in this case , second order ( colour ) effects in the terrestrial extinction may become important ( see section  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the same effect is seen in the j band ( reference level brightens by 0.35 mag , 2m1439 dims relative to this by 0.07 mag ) .",
    "however , on night 7 we see the same brightening of the reference level due to decreasing airmass ( 0.65 mag in both bands from airmass 2.8 to 1.05 ) but without any trend or significant variability in the light curves of either the reference stars or 2m1439 ( see right hand panel in fig .  [ 2m1439multi_lc ] ) .",
    "clearly , different atmospheric conditions must have prevailed on this night than on night 4 .",
    "correlated changes of up to 1 magnitude in j and  are found in the reference level at the beginning of night 6 , caused by thin clouds and humidity .",
    "correlated changes with amplitude up to 0.1 mag are also seen in the light curves of the reference stars and 2m1439 , indicating that these large extinction variations have not cancelled out in the relative photometry .",
    "this is presumably caused by water vapour changes associated with the clouds ( see section [ discussion ] ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "most of the features which account for the higher variability in 2m1439 ( compared to the reference stars ) appear to be related to terrestrial atmospheric phenomena .",
    "2m1439 has previously been monitored in the i - band by bailer - jones & mundt @xcite and by gelino et al .",
    "neither found good evidence for variability above about 0.01 mag , the former from temporally - dense observations ( 48 observations spread over four nights ) and the latter over longer timescales ( a few observations per night over 40 nights ) .",
    "* 2m1112 * this light curve shows some variations which at first sight would be of significance , but on closer inspection appear to be due to variations in the reference level .",
    "these are not qualitatively different from the `` problematic '' variations seen in the other two targets , discussed above .",
    "we performed a frequency - domain search for periodic variations using two methods , the clean and lomb - scargle periodograms .",
    "these methods yielded consistent results and showed no evidence for periodic variations in sdss1203 or 2m1439 .",
    "as implemented , these methods are known to be effective at detecting even low signal - to - noise periodic signals ( lamm et al .",
    "the method of relative photometry employed in this program ( and all those referred to in section [ introduction ] ) makes the implicit assumption that the earth s atmospheric extinction is the same for the target star as for the reference stars .",
    "however , the extinction coefficient varies with wavelength , so if the target and reference stars have different spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , their wavelength integrated extinctions are also different .",
    "this is relevant when monitoring ultra cool dwarfs , as the reference stars will usually be significantly hotter and hence bluer in the optical and near infrared ( see table  [ relphot ] ) .",
    "this would not matter for relative photometry if the extinction did not vary in time or space .",
    "but extinction does vary polychromatically with airmass and atmospheric conditions , thus introducing a change in the relative magnitude between stars with different seds .",
    "such effects are referred to as second order extinction .    in the visible ,",
    "the extinction is dominated by molecular ( rayleigh ) and aerosol scattering and generally shows a smooth decrease with increasing wavelength . in this case ,",
    "colour effects are either small or a broad band colour term can be used to correct relative photometry ( also as a function of airmass ) . in the near infrared , however , the extinction is dominated by molecular absorption , particularly of 2o , 2  and 3 , which show much sharper variations with wavelength .",
    "precipitable water vapour and ozone concentrations in particular can vary rapidly in time and space . _ thus even under apparently good observing conditions , second order extinction effects can have a significant impact on high precision , differential , broad band infrared photometry . _",
    "note that terrestial water clouds and fog are dominated by large ( @xmath81 ) water droplets , so these cause a scattering of visible and infrared light with only a weak wavelength dependence ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ) .",
    "nonetheless , some absorption also occurs in the liquid drops themselves which does show rapid changes in some wavelength ranges , although in the optical at least the colour dependence of terrestrial cloud extinction appears to be small ( honeycutt @xcite ; serkowski @xcite ) .",
    "however , where there are clouds there is presumably also a high water _",
    "vapour _ column density , with the result that clouds would contribute to second order extinction .",
    "unfortuntately , we can not quantify the effects of second order extinction on our data , because we have no independent measure of the atmospheric constituents  in particular the column density of the precipitable water vapour  and we would further require an appropriate atmospheric model matched to the calar alto conditions at the time .",
    "moreover we do not know the seds of the reference stars : the broad band j@xmath7  colour is too undersampled to determine the integrated extinction from a water spectrum ( young @xcite ) .",
    "an idea of the scale of the problem can be found from reference to the models of j and k extinction at kitt peak for a cool giant ( = 4000k ) and vega ( = 9650k ) from manduca & bell ( 1979 ) . at low water column density ,",
    "the differential extinction between the two stars ( e@xmath11e@xmath12 ) is 0.049 mag at j and 0.002 mag at k. increasing the water column density by a factor of 35 changes these to 0.067 mag at j and 0.001 mag at k. thus increasing the precipitable water density increases the differential extinction ( so decreases the apparent brightness of a cool star relative to a hotter star ) by approximately 0.02 mag at j and @xmath70.001 mag at k. the actual precipitable water column density experienced during our observations could be larger , so it is not implausible that water vapour changes cause the apparent variability we see in the l dwarfs .",
    "contrary to the figures given above , however , we generally see similar amplitude variations in j as in . but",
    "our  filter extends further into the blueward telluric absorption band than does the johnson k band of manduca & bell and these figures are quite sensitive to the band profile .",
    "also , our target ( and probably reference ) stars have much lower temperatures than 4000k and 9650k .",
    "changes in airmass under stable conditions can also change the relative photometry .",
    "for example , manduca & bell show that the j band magnitude of a cool giant relative to vega would be at least 0.01 mag higher when measured at airmass 2.0 than at airmass 1.0 .",
    "the effect is much smaller in the k band , however , so this may not be cause of the dimming of 2m1439 on night 4 discussed in section [ results ] ( see fig . [",
    "2m1439multi_lc ] ) , as there the dimming is larger in  than j. however , this may again be due to the differences between the k and  bands and the seds of the stars .",
    "recall that no such dimming was seen on night 7 for the same airmass change , perhaps indicating different causes of extinction on these nights .",
    "the fact that both sdss1203 and 2m1439 showed larger  values for j and  than the reference stars can be attributed to the likelihood that the reference stars have more similar seds to each other than to l dwarfs , so that differential extinction effects between any one reference star and all the other reference stars ( which form its reference level ) are much smaller .",
    "hence the reference stars show less variability .",
    "second order extinction is less of a problem in the optical ( @xmath13 ) , but here most brown dwarfs are far too faint to be monitored .",
    "the i band ( @xmath140.780.92 ) is a good compromise .",
    "this too is intersected by a water absorption band centered at 0.81 , but this band is much weaker than those effecting the j and k bands ( e.g.  mccord & clark @xcite ) .",
    "the prime requirements of any search for variability are ( 1 ) a measurement of the scale of the variability _ intrinsic _ to the source , and ( 2 ) an accurate determination of the observational errors in these measurements .",
    "however the analysis is done , a variability detection relies on the former being significantly larger than the latter .",
    "we have developed an observation and data reduction technique which gives an accurate and reliable determination of the photometric errors , arising from the source , background , detector and effect of the data processing ( see section  [ photometry ] ) .",
    "one of the main problems with ground - based monitoring is variations in the extinction ( scattering plus absorption ) of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the standard procedure of differential photometry was used to give a measure of intrinsic variability . using this ,",
    "some evidence for variability was found in the observed l dwarfs .",
    "however , closer analysis has shown that this measure is probably `` contaminated '' by second order extinction effects in the earth s atmosphere ( see section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "although we have no direct evidence for this , it seems the most plausible cause of the observed variability given the features we have described and the elimination of other potential causes .",
    "we therefore conclude that we have no good evidence for intrinsic variability in any of the three l dwarfs monitored .",
    "none of these objects showed significant correlations in their j and  light curves , as evidenced by correlation plots and our @xmath4 parameter .",
    "some such ( anti)correlation would be expected if the variability is caused by cool spots or dust features .",
    "upper limits on the peak - to - peak amplitude of _ persistent _ variability are set by the scatter in the light curves under the most stable earth atmospheric conditions . for both j and ,",
    "these limits are set at 0.04 mag for sdss1203 and 2m1439 and 0.08 for 2m1112 .    as late m ,",
    "l and t dwarfs are at their brightest in the near infrared ( 0.92.5 ) and show spectral signatures which could discriminate between various surface feature scenarios ( bailer - jones @xcite ) , this is a desirable wavelength range for variability monitoring .",
    "we have shown that high _ precision _ differential photometry ( random errors of less than two percent ) can be achieved on l dwarfs with infrared arrays . however , as a measure of the intrinsic variability in l dwarfs , broad band differential infrared photometry appears to be limited in _",
    "accuracy _ to a few percent by variations in terrestrial molecular extinction , in particular precipitable water vapour .",
    "these second order extinction effects could be reduced in one or more ways :    1 .   use of passbands which avoid molecular extinction , in particular use of better designed ( narrower ) j and  filters to avoid the strong 2o  bands which generally intersect these `` standard '' filters ; 2 .",
    "use of narrower band filters , which reduces the effect of second order extinction ( this would obviously require a larger telescope or longer integration times ; the latter will be unacceptable for detecting short - term variability ) ; 3 .",
    "use of specially designed filters to monitor the dominant molecular absorption ( in particular 2o )  from which the broad band relative photometry could , in principle , be corrected ( angione @xcite ) .",
    "this could be done using a multi - channel camera .",
    "however , additional spectroscopic observations are required to calibrate the measures and so apply the correction .",
    "nonetheless , some kind of time - dependent monitoring of extinction would at least allow one to recognise when observing conditions were variable ; 4 .",
    "observing from very dry sites under atmospherically stable conditions .",
    "space - based observations remove all problems related to second order extinction .",
    "a strong discriminant between candidate surface features in brown dwarfs is the variability signatures in the water absorption bands at 1.351.45  and 1.802.00  ( e.g.  bailer - jones @xcite .",
    "these bands can not be reliably monitored from the ground , providing another argument for space - based observations .",
