    "the formation and evolution of active galaxies is an interesting and unsolved question .",
    "it is not yet obvious why a small fraction of galaxies have a degree of central activity many times larger than that of normal galaxies , or why a still smaller fraction produce radio jets . nor is it fully understood why active galaxies harbouring the most powerful radio sources appear to be almost exclusively elliptical galaxies .",
    "much work has been done investigating the possibility that active galaxies form as a result of mergers ( toomre & toomre 1972 , hutchings et al .",
    "1984 , canalizo & stockton 2001 ) ; the evidence for this includes disturbed morphologies , including features suggestive of tidal tails .",
    "more recently , hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging of a large sample of 3cr galaxies ( de koff et al .",
    "2000 ) has revealed that a large number of nearby radio - loud active galaxies contain prominent dust lanes , suggestive of the capture of interstellar medium by the accreting galaxy .",
    "the study of the physical properties of the dust and gas in relativistic plasmas at the centres of active galaxies is of great interest .",
    "the dust distribution can be studied using optical and infra - red imaging .",
    "the atomic gas can be studied using the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen . as well as giving clues to formation of active galaxies ,",
    "dust and gas may obscure the direct view to the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and thus affect our ability to view the central optical continuum and broad - emission - line region .",
    "unfortunately , emission lines from atomic hydrogen can only be seen by integrating over large areas  typically tens of arcseconds  because of its low ( @xmath10k ) brightness temperature and the current sensitivities of decimeter arrays .",
    "however , provided the neutral gas is in front of a strong source of radio continuum , absorption studies can be used to study the atomic hydrogen on subarcsecond scales .",
    "parameters such as the transverse velocity gradients and structure of the neutral gas can then contribute to an understanding of the dynamics of the nuclear regions of active galaxies .",
    "3c305 is a low - redshift radio galaxy with several unusual properties .",
    "the galaxy has some of the characteristics of a spiral galaxy with a thin dust lane crossing the nuclear region and was classified by sandage ( 1966 ) as an sa(pec ) .",
    "the radio structure is an order of magnitude smaller than is usual for powerful , steep spectrum sources and reveals twin central radio jets feeding two radio lobes , with extended weak emission from perpendicular arms ( lonsdale & morison 1980 , heckman et al .",
    "the radio source is confined within and perhaps by the galactic disc .",
    "two investigations by heckman et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and jackson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have revealed a strong association between the radio structure and the optical emission line region .",
    "there is strong evidence ( jackson et al . 1995 ; martel et al .",
    "1999 ) that much of the optical view of the source is affected by dust obscuration .",
    "heckman et al .",
    "( 1982 ) suggested that the galaxy may be the result of a merger which triggered nuclear activity .",
    "the remnants of the merger debris are interacting with the radio jet to produce the striking radio morphology .",
    "there is also evidence for two tidal tails extending from the galaxy ( heckman et al 1986 ) , which may have led to sandage s original classification of the galaxy as sa(pec ) , and for unusual stellar kinematics .",
    "heckman et al . ( 1982 ) found a low stellar velocity dispersion ( 170kms@xmath5 ) , relatively high stellar rotation velocity ( a mean 140kms@xmath5 for 0.2 - 0.5@xmath11 ) about the minor axis ( pa 7@xmath12 ) which was of solid - body form to 5kpc and a flat rotation curve further out .",
    "they also found a `` rotation '' amplitude of over 200kms@xmath5 for the [ oiii ]  gas and concluded that the stellar velocity is only just over 50% of the gas velocity .",
    "finally , they identified the twisting of the optical isophotes with distance from the nucleus , and the presence of a dust lane , as strong evidence for a merger origin of the galaxy .",
    "peculiar kinematics fit naturally into this picture and would be expected if a companion is gradually being absorbed into the main body of the 3c305 host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , both ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , sanders et al . 1988 ) and quasars ( heckman et al .",
    "1986 ) are suspected to be frequent consequences of mergers , with a possible evolutionary sequence ( see e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ) connecting mergers to ulirgs and thence to quasar activity on a timescale of a few hundred million years .",
    "3c305 , however , has a 60@xmath6 m flux of 0.2  jy , about 2% of that of a typical ulirg at its redshift .",
    "any merger must therefore have taken place some time ago or else have produced relatively little of the obscured star formation which accounts for the far - infrared flux of a typical ulirg .    more recently , baum et al . ( 1988 )",
    "have also observed the extended optical emission - line gas and draper et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have studied the optical polarization , which is probably dichroic in origin and associated with the same foreground screen that obscures the optical view of the nucleus .",
    "jackson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used hst images of the emission - line gas to quantify the radio - optical association and to constrain models of the interaction of radio jets with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the relatively low redshift ( z=0.0417 ) of 3c305 makes it an ideal candidate to study the neutral gas at 02-resolution using merlin , and to study the dust and emission lines at approximately the same resolution using the hst in the optical and infrared . in this paper",
    "we present new images from both instruments .",
    "the aims are to investigate whether or not the active nucleus can be detected in the infrared and measure the extinction in front of it ; to study the interaction of the radio jet and emission - line gas and the contribution of the former to the excitation of the line emission ; and to use the estimates of dust and gas columns we derive to constrain the geometry of the system . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume h@xmath13 = 75 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 which implies a distance of 167 mpc and hence 1 arcsecond is equivalent to 810 pc in 3c305 .",
    "the 21-cm radio observations were made in june 1997 , using the merlin array , including the 76-m lovell telescope , resulting in a maximum baseline length of 217 km .",
    "two 8-mhz bands , with opposite circular polarizations were observed with 64 correlator channels per polarization , resulting in a channel bandwidth of 125 khz ( 26.3 kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "the central frequency in channel 32 corresponds to a heliocentric optical velocity of 12825 kms@xmath5 ( z=0.0417 ) .",
    "3c305 was observed over a period of 14 hours , interspersed with observations of a phase calibrator , 1442 + 637 , and a bandpass calibrator , 0552 + 398 was observed for 1 hour .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was determined from an observation of 3c 286 , which was assumed to have a flux density of 15.0 jy ( baars et al .",
    "initial editing and calibration was carried out using standard merlin programs .    further editing was undertaken and phase and bandpass calibration were applied within aips .",
    "individual telescopes were weighted according to their gains and 1442 + 637 was found to be suitable for both phase and bandpass calibration .",
    "the continuum image was formed by compressing channels 3 to 61 followed by 4 passes of self - calibration .",
    "the _ uv _ data were fourier transformed using uniform weighting and deconvolved from the beam of the telescope using a clean - based algorithm ( hgbom 1974 ) .",
    "a naturally weighted spectral line cube was formed by subtracting 24 absorption free channels ( channels 6 to 13 , 17 to 28 and 58 to 61 ) from the _ uv _ data .",
    "the _ uv _ data were then fourier transformed and deconvolved from the beam .",
    "the cleaned continuum was added back to the continuum - subtracted cube and spectra at specific coordinates were obtained .",
    "3c305 was observed with the hst s near - infrared camera / multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) with a variety of filters on 1998 july 16 and july 19 .",
    "wide - band images were obtained at 1.6@xmath6 m with the f160w filter ( roughly corresponding to cousins @xmath8-band ) , and at 2.2@xmath6 m with the pol0l , pol60l and pol120l filters ; polarization information was therefore obtained at the latter wavelength .",
    "narrow - band images were obtained with the f170 m filter , which covers the redshifted infra - red [ feii]line at 1.644@xmath6 m , and continuum was subtracted from these images using data taken with the f180 m filter .",
    "other data , all observed after the costar installation which solved the hst spherical aberration problem , were extracted from the hst archive .",
    "these data included optical observations from the wide field & planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , taken with the f702w filter on 1994 september 04 , and including both continuum and h@xmath14/[nii ]  emission .",
    "a faint object camera ( foc ) image at 430 nm from 1997 january 12 was also extracted .",
    "table 1 contains complete details of the observations including exposure times ; figure 1 shows the contaminating lines which are present in each continuum filter .",
    ".log of the hst observations . *",
    "denotes that the observation was extracted from the hst archive .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , <",
    ", > , < \" , ]     the natural inference from these observations is that we are indeed detecting the central agn in 3c305 in the infrared .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached in ground - based images of a sample of 3cr radio galaxies by simpson , ward & wall ( 2000 ) who detected excess flux in 5 out of 10 sets of infrared images .",
    "simpson et al.s observations were ground - based , and their analysis relied on separation of the central nuclear light by fitting a de vaucouleurs profile together with an unresolved component . here",
    "we are able to resolve down to 007 and determine the parameters of the nucleus directly .",
    "the infrared colour of the nucleus of 3c305 is roughly comparable to the typical @xmath15 found by simpson et al .",
    "however , with the @xmath16-band limit we can derive an estimate for the reddening .",
    "we assume that the hidden nucleus is a quasar , and furthermore assume a typical optical - ir spectral energy distribution represented by a power - law , @xmath17 . using the @xmath8- and @xmath16-band results , we find for @xmath14=0.5 that the central reddening @xmath9 magnitudes .",
    "this is a relatively modest limit beside those derived from infrared emission - line ( ward et al .",
    "1991 ) and x - ray ( ueno et al . 1994 ) observations of objects such as cygnus a. however , the @xmath8-band continuum flux may be coming from a relatively large area and be subject to less obscuration than the central part of the nuclear region .",
    "further deep observations in the red optical and near - ir would establish the point - source spectral energy distribution and hence the obscuration to the nuclear component more definitively .",
    "the astrometry we carried out ( section 2.3 ) shows that the brightest part of the radio image is not coincident with the optical / infrared nucleus discussed above .",
    "hence this radio component is most likely a knot in the jet , certainly not a radio nucleus , and hence we shall refer to this as ne jet a. the optical nucleus ( figure 2 ) , appears to be situated in the gap between this component and the se jet and hence has a radio flux density less than 1 mjy .",
    "this could be a consequence of either synchrotron self absorption , or free - free absorption by nuclear ionised gas with an emission measure of @xmath18 pc @xmath19 .",
    "it could also be a consequence of relativistic beaming ; if the radio plasma is outflowing with a lorentz @xmath20 of about 5 , then doppler deboosting of intrinsic flux takes place if the outflow is further than about 60@xmath12 to the line of sight . such an angle would still maintain the observed factor of a few in relative boosting of the flux of the northeastern jet relative to the southwestern jet , if the ne jet was the approaching radio jet .",
    "clearly hi  absorption can not be measured in the direction of the nucleus , and hence no limits can be set to atomic hydrogen column densities associated with a dusty torus on scales of @xmath0110  pc .",
    "we can use the hst observations to determine the amount of dust reddening present and the merlin hi  absorption observations to determine the neutral gas column in front of the radio source . if these are compatible , assuming standard dust - to - gas ratios , it means that the dust as well as the gas must lie in front of the radio source ; hence we can make deductions about the overall geometry of the radio source .",
    "we consider both components in turn .",
    "a distinct dust lane extends over the central region of 3c305 , offset 04 to the se of the nucleus ( see fig .",
    "the dust lane splits into two distinct structures , about 06 wide , extending 15 to the northeast of the nucleus .",
    "the dust lane is most prominent to the southwest of the nucleus and extends 45 to the southwest of the nucleus before bending sharply .",
    "the apparent cone - like shape of the optical nucleus perpendicular to the radio axis is explained by the obscuration of the emission in the southwest of the source by the dust lane .",
    "dust obscuration is probably also responsible for the apparent highly localised ( @xmath210.25 arcsec@xmath22 ) regions of emission to the s and sw of the nucleus . over the central 2 arcsec",
    ", the structure appears to be consistent with an inclined disc of dust encircling the active galactic nucleus at an inclination of @xmath0 45@xmath12 .    in order to quantify the amount of dust present ,",
    "we have generated a map of extinction @xmath23 using the 1.6-@xmath6 m image together with the 702-nm image .",
    "when these images are divided , the northern segment shows smooth undisturbed contours , and these have been assumed to represent the unobscured emission of the galaxy .",
    "this has been fitted with an elliptically symmetric function , divided out , and the extinction map in magnitudes has been formed by taking the logarithm and multiplying by 2.5 . assuming that the extinction @xmath24e(b@xmath25v ) , a reddening map of @xmath26 can be derived if we assume galactic properties for the dust ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "the typical @xmath26 is about 1.5 magnitudes across much of the source , implying a gas column of about 3.4@xmath27@xmath3 assuming galactic gas - to - dust ratios . in particular",
    ", this is the predicted gas column against the sw radio lobe",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that the derived e(b@xmath25v ) for the dust is a lower limit . if the dust column were not all situated in front of the majority of the galaxy emission , much larger values of e(b@xmath25v ) , and hence larger gas columns , would be needed .",
    "the comparison of the dust prediction with direct hi measurements can therefore be used directly to constrain the geometry in this case .",
    "we have detected neutral hydrogen absorption against the southwestern jet and lobe which confirms the presence of neutral gas in front of these radio structures ( see fig .",
    "the absorption is localised to the southwest side only , which we attribute to gas associated with a peculiar shaped dust lane ( see fig .",
    "the fact that absorption is seen against the southwestern jet agrees with the plausible assumption that the northeastern radio jet has a component of its velocity towards us and appears brighter than the sw jet due to doppler boosting .",
    "the average column density of the neutral hydrogen against the southwestern lobe is high , n@xmath28 = ( 1.9 @xmath40.7)@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 and is similar to column densities found against the central regions of the radio galaxy 3c293 ( @xmath0 1.7 @xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 - beswick et al 2002 ) .",
    "this agrees within a factor of 2 with the column density derived above ( section 4.2.1 ) using optical reddening .",
    "given the assumptions of both methods , such as a spin temperature of 100k in the radio method and a galactic dust to gas ratio in the optical method , there is reasonable agreement in the column density estimates .",
    "this is consistent with the atomic hydrogen being associated with optical dust lane and that the dust lane is in front of the southwestern radio lobe .",
    "the dust lane extends over an area of @xmath03.2 arcsec@xmath22 out to 4.5 arcsec southwest of the nucleus . assuming an average column density over this region of 1.9 @xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 , the total mass of neutral hydrogen in the dust lane is 3 @xmath110@xmath29 m@xmath30 .",
    "our results help to explain the observations of draper et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and jackson et al .",
    "draper et al . investigated the polarization structure of 3c305 and concluded that the lack of coincidence between the polarised regions and the emission line regions or radio jet axis was due to obscuration within the host galaxy .",
    "jackson et al . found the southern side of the nucleus was slightly redder in colour which they also interpreted as a consequence of obscuration .",
    "the centroid velocity of the absorption line ( 12640@xmath426 km s@xmath5 ) is red - shifted by 130 km s@xmath5 relative to the systemic velocity of ( 12510@xmath460 ) km s@xmath5 ( heckman et al .",
    "optical spectroscopy by heckman et al .",
    "( 1982 ) obtained velocities for the [ oiii ]  emission along pa 57@xmath12 with a velocity resolution of @xmath0130 km s@xmath5 .",
    "there is a clear agreement between the emission - line velocity and the neutral hydrogen velocity implying that the kinematics of the two structures are linked .",
    "the neutral hydrogen absorption is localised on scales of @xmath02 arcsec as can be seen in fig .",
    "the velocities of the absorbing gas are shown in fig 4 .",
    "the velocity of the absorbing components varies over the region by @xmath0 75 km s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath5 . from fig .",
    "10 of heckman et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , the velocity gradient of the emission line gas along pa 57@xmath12 over the central 6.5 arcsec is @xmath080 km s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "the kinematics of the neutral and ionised gas are inconsistent with the stellar dynamics which represent only @xmath055% of the rotation velocity of the ionised gas as found by heckman et al .",
    "this is consistent with heckman s original ( 1982 ) suggestion that the neutral gas is disturbed by the radio jets .",
    "from our neutral hydrogen absorption observations we can infer that the sw radio structure lies behind the nuclear dust lane .",
    "however no absorption is detected against the stronger northeast lobe despite the presence of dust lanes .",
    "we interpet this as evidence that the northeast lobe is in front of the neutral gas .",
    "thus we suggest that the radio emission is towards the observer in the northeast and away from the observer in the southwest .",
    "the kinematics of the neutral gas and dust appear to be closely linked with the dynamics of the ionised gas ( heckman et al .",
    "1982 ) . considering the apparent disc - like structure of the dust lane in the central few arcsec",
    ", we suggest that both the neutral and ionised gas are undergoing circular motion around the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the mechanism by which emission lines in active galaxies are excited is complex and not well understood .",
    "a possible source of ionization is the emission of hard - uv and x - ray photons from the central agn .",
    "such a nucleus may well be present in 3c305 although as we have argued above the obscuration may prevent us from seeing the nucleus directly .",
    "the other possibility is that shocks induced by the radio jet s passage through the intergalactic medium photoionize the gas ( sutherland , bicknell & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "the primary physical mechanism in this case is still photoionization , but in this case carried out by the high - energy photons produced in the shock . because of the relative similarity of the two processes , it is not easy to distinguish which is actually responsible for the observed line emission .",
    "one diagnostic may be the infra - red [ feii]line , which is known to be produced abundantly in fast shocks associated , for example , with supernova remnants ( moorwood & oliva 1988 ) .",
    "forbes & ward ( 1993 ) suggested that shocks may also be responsible for [ feii]emission , the strength of which is correlated with radio core flux densities in seyfert galaxies .",
    "simpson et al . (",
    "1996 ) have investigated the production of [ feii]in detail and present diagnostic diagrams involving the ratios of [ feii]/pa@xmath31 and [ oi]/h@xmath14 .",
    "they find more scatter between [ feii]and radio fluxes than forbes & ward and suggest in particular that normal agn photoionization can account for the observed ratios of [ feii]/pa@xmath31 in their sample .",
    "in 3c305 we have an opportunity to study this in detail .",
    "the reason is that in this object there is a close association of the northeastern termination of a radio jet with a strong region of line emission .",
    "such a structure would be expected to produce line ratios corresponding to shock excitation .    in fig .",
    "11 we show a slice through the northeast section of the emission line region .",
    "it is apparent that the profiles of [ feii]and [ oiii]are different ; there is a clear peak of [ feii]around the point where the jet terminates , and [ oiii]is more evenly distributed throughout the emission line region .",
    "this strongly suggests that we are here seeing an increase in [ feii]flux due to shock ionization around an interaction region .",
    "the h@xmath14/[feii]flux ratio in this region is about 17 . assuming case b values for the hydrogen line emission , and converting from our [ feii]@xmath32 m fluxes to the 1.257-@xmath6 m line used by simpson et al .",
    ", we obtain a ratio [ feii]@xmath33/pa@xmath31 of just over 1 . adopting heckman et al.s ( 1982 ) value of @xmath00.13 for the radio",
    "[ oi]/h@xmath14 puts the strong emission - line region in 3c305 approximately in the region of simpson et al.s diagnostic diagram where standard seyfert emission lines lie .",
    "this implies in turn that standard seyferts may have some contribution to their line emission from jet - induced shocks , although this argument does not of course prove that this is the case .",
    "the major results of this paper are the discovery of a pointlike infrared nucleus ; the identification of the nuclear position which is not coincident with the bright central radio component ; neutral hydrogen gas rotation velocities of 130kms@xmath5 relative to systemic velocity , aligned with , and sharing a common velocity gradient with , the emission line gas ; the comparison of dust and gas columns which shows that most of the dust associated with the emission line gas is in front of the southwestern part of the radio source ( and hence that the southwestern radio jet is almost certainly the receding jet ) ; and the discovery of peaks of [ feii ]  1.64@xmath6 m emission coincident with radio hotspots , consistent with the presence of jet - induced shocks .",
    "there is no evidence from the new infrared picture that 3c305 contains a double nucleus as in the case of the merging system mkn 463 ( hutchings & neff 1989 ) , and the infrared isophotes are quite smooth indicating a relatively undisturbed old stellar population , such as might be expected @xmath34 yr from the start of a merger process .",
    "the point infrared nucleus is consistent with a central qso which may have formed during the course of the merger .",
    "we thank simon garrington and tom muxlow for assistance with the observations and ian browne for useful comments .",
    "we are very grateful to r. argyle and l. morrison for their work in fixing the astrometry of the 3c305 field .",
