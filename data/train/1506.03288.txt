    "granular materials are typically composed of thousands to millions of individual particles ( or more )",
    ". think for example of the cereals for breakfast or of the sand on the shore .",
    "these large numbers suggest that statistical methods may be applicable and constitute a powerful tool in developing a better theoretical understanding of these kinds of materials .",
    "however , contrary to the situation in gases or fluids , where the permitted phase space is explored continuously due to chaotic molecular motion , thermal fluctuations are negligible for granular materials .",
    "furthermore , the particle dynamics are dissipative .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to carry standard statistical mechanics over to granular assemblies . in particular , the classical boltzmann distribution , where the probability of a state is inversely proportional to the exponential of its energy ( measured in units of @xmath1 ) , will not apply to these systems .",
    "edwards and oakeshott @xcite proposed that concepts from classical statistical mechanics are applicable , if one assumes that the volume of a static , stable granulate plays the same role in granular statistics as the energy of a microstate in classical statistics .",
    "this means that , analogous to the classical microcanonical ensemble , where all states with the same energy are equally probable , all mechanically stable configurations of the granular assembly that occupy the same volume occur with the same probability .",
    "the entropy of this granular microcanonical ensemble is proportional to the logarithm of the number of blocked states with a certain volume . by analogy with classical statistics",
    ", one can define a temperature - like variable , called compactivity , as the inverse of the derivative of the edwards entropy with respect to the volume .",
    "later , it turned out that for a full description of a granular system , beyond the volume ensemble also an ensemble for the different stress states must be introduced @xcite and that the volume and the stress ensembles are probably interdependent @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that expectation values of quantities that depend on the geometrical state only and not on the stress state are well described by the volume ensemble @xcite , possibly because the force - moment tensor can be treated as approximately constant in the systems considered here .",
    "therefore we focus on the volume ensemble in most of the present paper .",
    "some doubts about the temperature - like interpretation of the compactivity have been raised on the basis of equilibration experiments performed by puckett and daniels @xcite .",
    "they found that in a two - component system , the compactivity did not equilibrate , whereas the angoricity did .",
    "there are different ways to explain this observation , some of which do not necessitate to give up the interpretation of the compactivity as a temperature - like variable .",
    "a key assumption of standard statistical mechanics is the equivalence of time and ensemble averages , but mechanically stable granular configurations are static states without any intrinsic time evolution . on the other hand , by applying the same external excitation to the granular material again and again ( i.e.  tapping @xcite or shearing @xcite ) , this external excitation may take over the role of thermal agitation and the concept of a time average becomes meaningful for granular statistics as well .",
    "some tests of the ergodicity of granular systems are available in the literature . with systems of frictional discs excited with flow pulses , equivalence between time and ensemble averages",
    "was found @xcite . in the case of a vertical tapping protocol ,",
    "dependency on the protocol parameters was noted . especially for small tapping amplitudes ,",
    "nonergodicity was observed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this may be related to the occurrence of irreversible branches in tapped granular systems @xcite .",
    "several methods were proposed to determine the compactivity from experimental or simulation data @xcite and applied to different kinds of granulates . in this work ,",
    "we employ two - dimensional discrete - element ( dem ) simulations using polygonal particles to apply two different excitation protocols to otherwise identical granulates .",
    "this allows us to determine whether the calculated compactivity is independent of the specific excitation protocol ( which would support the edwards theory ) or not ( which would oppose it ) .",
    "recently , some authors have addressed the issue whether or not it is necessary to introduce protocol specific extensions of edwards - like approaches @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss a possible approach in section [ sec : protocoldependence ] .",
    "at least for the two protocols considered in this paper , we find protocol independence .",
    "furthermore , we test whether ideal - gas - like prediction analogies of the edwards theory are consistent with the simulation data , and find good qualitative agreement , which even becomes quantitative if certain parameters are chosen by fitting .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theo ] , we give an overview of some aspects of edwards theory , relevant to this work . in section [",
    "sec : method ] , we introduce the simulation technique . section [ sec : protocol ] gives details of the applied excitation protocols and in section [ sec : anwendung ] , the simulation results will be presented , evaluated and discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] , some limitations of the volume ensemble are illustrated .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] gives a summary of our findings .",
    "the main assumption of the edwards theory is the following @xcite : if a granular ensemble is generated by a _",
    "reproducible _ preparation protocol , all resulting mechanically stable configurations of the granular system which occupy the same volume will occur with the same probability on repetition of the protocol .",
    "this means that in edwards granular statistics the volume plays the same role as the energy in ordinary statistics .",
    "consequently , the entropy @xmath2 of the microcanonical ensemble having a certain volume @xmath3 is given as the logarithm of the number @xmath4 of stable states ( in the permitted phase space ) occupying this volume .    let a microstate of the granular ensemble , comprised of @xmath5 particles , be described by a set of variables @xmath6 .",
    "the entropy of this state is given by ( see e.  g. @xcite ) : @xmath7 the integral runs over all stable configurations @xmath8 and the function @xmath9 gives the volume of the state @xmath6 .",
    "note that in this context , @xmath10 is the granular analogue of the hamiltonian and @xmath3 is the analogue of the internal energy .    by analogy with standard statistical mechanics , an intensive , temperature - like variable @xmath11 can be defined , usually called compactivity : @xmath12 in this paper , we will , for simplicity , mostly use the `` thermodynamic beta '' , defined as the inverse compactivity @xmath13 , instead of the compactivity itself .",
    "note that in general , a constant @xmath14 analogous to the boltzmann constant may be introduced in and . here",
    ", we use @xmath15 which means that we measure compactivity in units of volume .    as in ordinary statistics",
    "/ thermodynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) one may switch from the microcanonical ensemble to the canonical ensemble by a legendre transformation . in the corresponding canonical ensemble ,",
    "the probability of a microstate @xmath16 occupying the volume @xmath10 is given by a boltzmann - like distribution : @xmath17 with the canonical partition function @xcite @xmath18 once again , the integral runs over all possible mechanically stable states . note that this is equivalent to a notation often used in the literature , where the integral runs over all states and contains an additional factor @xmath19 , which takes the value zero for forbidden states and one for allowed ones , thus selecting the permitted states .    note that a tapping protocol does not necessarily lead to canonical sampling of the system .",
    "a trivial example would be tapping with so small an amplitude that the system is trapped in the initial blocked state .",
    "a non - trivial example is the irreversible branch for vertical tapping observed by nowak _ et .",
    "also , the comparison between the analytically solvable bowles - ashwin model system @xcite and simulations where such a system is vertically tapped @xcite exhibits deviations from the canonical ensemble prediction . note that the bowles - ashwin model assumes a highly confined geometry with much lower complexity than realistic granular systems .",
    "vertical tapping applied to this special system with strong confinement may be unsuited for phase space exploration according to a flat probability measure . or",
    "else the flat edwards measure does not hold in general .",
    "even if that were the case , a meaningful definition of compactivity might still be possible as will be described now .      in case",
    "it turned out that edwards assumption of a flat probability measure is not satisfied for the microcanical ensemble , it is possible to modify the ensemble with ( in general , state and protocol dependent ) weighting factors @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the microcanical state density would be modified as follows @xmath21 providing we have @xmath22 which is a much weaker assumption than a flat probability measure @xcite , it is still possible to define a compactivity .",
    "the canonical formulation for the volume ensemble then reads @xmath23 a similar approach is feasible for the force - moment and the combined ensembles .",
    "generalised canonical ensembles of this kind are used in statistical genetics @xcite .",
    "the qualitative impact of these modifications on the resulting thermodynamics is small .",
    "especially equations and remain unaffected , as long as the weighting factors are the same for all data samples . if only one protocol is used , it is impossible to detect protocol dependencies in the weighting factors . but a comparison of different protocols , applied to the same system , may help to decide whether these factors , if their introduction should turn out necessary , are protocol independent or not .      the calculation of the mean volume and its fluctuations is straightforward .",
    "the first derivative of the logarithm of ( or ) with respect to @xmath24 essentially is the mean volume @xmath25 whereas its second derivative is the variance of the volume distribution , i.e. , a measure for the strength of fluctuations .",
    "@xmath26 instead of the volume itself , we use the the volume fraction @xmath27 , defined as the sum of the grain volumes @xmath28 divided by the volume @xmath29 occupied by the granulate : @xmath30 the volume @xmath10 of a certain state can be written as a sum of the mean volume @xmath31 and the deviation from the mean : @xmath32 . under the assumption that the volume fluctuations are small compared to the mean volume",
    ", we can write : @xmath33 the mean volume fraction is therefore : @xmath34 and from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phisim],[eq : phimw ] ) , together with @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath36 substituting @xmath37 from eq .   and reexpressing the differential of @xmath38 according to @xmath39 , we find a relation between the mean volume fraction and its fluctuations : @xmath40 measuring the volume fraction fluctuations as a function of the mean volume fraction and integrating equation or , respectively , is a way to calculate the compactivity up to an unknown constant .",
    "it is used frequently , e.g. , in @xcite . note that determining the granular temperature via eq .   or eq .   is just a rule of calculation , provided by edwards theory but no proof of the theory . on the other hand , if after determining @xmath24 in some different way the relationship linking it with the volume fraction were not satisfied , a contradiction to edwards theory would have been demonstrated .",
    "another way to determine the inverse compactivity is the overlapping histogram method proposed in 2003 by dean and lefvre @xcite .",
    "this method may also be used as a test whether or not a distribution of blocked states is boltzmann - like distributed . in the original paper , the method was applied to the energy of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model for spin glasses , driven by a tapping - like mechanism , which has some similarities to granular dynamics .",
    "the method was then frequently used to determine the granular temperature @xcite . under the assumption that edwards theory holds , the probability to measure a certain volume v in a granulate with an inverse compactivity @xmath41 and a fixed number of grains @xmath5 is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of blocked states with volume @xmath3 , i.e @xmath44 .",
    "this equation holds even for the generalised non - flat probability measure approach , when eq .",
    "is used for @xmath45 .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath46 as the logarithm of the ratio of probability densities for the volume @xmath3 to arise , on the one hand at an inverse compactivity @xmath47 and on the other hand , in a reference system held at a different inverse compactivity @xmath41 : @xmath48 therefore , if we measure the probability density @xmath49 for different compactivities and calculate @xmath50 , the resulting function must be linear if edwards theory holds .",
    "evaluating the slope @xmath51 allows us to determine the inverse compactivity up to an additive constant .",
    "furthermore , the intercept @xmath52 is nothing else than the logarithm of the partition function up to an additive constant at the corresponding inverse compactivity .",
    "this permits testing the validity of edwards assumption in the sense , that if @xmath50 were not a straight line , neither eq .   nor",
    ".   would describe the probability density of the system correctly .",
    "however , one has to be somewhat careful with the interpretation of the results , as has been pointed out in @xcite . under certain circumstances , very similar results as the ones expected from edwards theory can occur , if the distributions of the samples are just gaussian . in appendix [ app :",
    "gauss ] , we discuss this situation .",
    "there are very few real ab initio predictions from edwards theory in the literature @xcite , due to some general difficulties . in order to calculate analytical expressions for the partition function , knowledge of an explicit expression for the granular hamiltonian @xmath9",
    "is necessary .",
    "of course , if all positions , orientations and shapes of the grains are known , the occupied volume is a function of these quantities , but in practice it is not easy to write down an explicit equation and even if this can be done , the integration over the permitted blocked states is very difficult because the permitted states are unknown in general .",
    "therefore , attempts to calculate the partition function were based on standard volume tessellations , such as the voronoi and delaunay tessellations @xcite .",
    "a possible alternative is an arch - based approach @xcite which a priori takes only stable configurations into account .",
    "blumenfeld and edwards proposed a physically motivated tessellation based on the quadron construction @xcite . in principle , quadrons are used as quasi - particles describing the structure of the granulate at any arbitrary position within the system in a distinct way .",
    "it was mentioned in the literature that the ideal quadron tesselation fails in the presence of non - convex voids in the granulate @xcite . however , in a system of monodisperse spheres such non - convex voids vanish by neglecting rattlers @xcite .",
    "even if some non - convex voids remain , they could be tesselated by convex polygons which repairs the quadron tessellation , at the price that the number of quadrons increases .",
    "as long as non - convex voids are the exception rather than the rule , they will not produce significant changes to the calculations .    under the ( very rough ) assumption that quadrons occupy volumes between @xmath53 and @xmath54 at constant density of states and that there are no interactions between the quadrons , the partition function can be calculated explicitly for two dimensional systems ( see @xcite ) : @xmath55 where @xmath5 is the number of particles and @xmath56 is the mean coordination number in the granular system .",
    "this approximation is called the ideal quadron approximation by analogy with the description of ideal gases in ordinary statistics .",
    "note that the partition function is a special version of a more general ideal - gas - like approach .",
    "if one assumes that the volume is tesselated by a number @xmath57 of statistically independent , non - interacting elementary cells and their volume is restricted to an interval between a minimal volume @xmath53 and a maximal volume @xmath54 , without any additional assumption on the nature of these elementary cells one ends up with eq .  , on replacing @xmath58 .",
    "contrary to the very general ideal - gas - like approach , there are some possibilities to go beyond the interaction - free situation in the quadron approach , which will be considered in future work .    using ,",
    "the ideal quadron prediction for the mean volume is obtained : @xmath59 for the current work , it is helpful to rewrite in terms of the volume fraction .",
    "dividing by the total grain volume @xmath28 results in @xmath60 in order to specify the free parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we assume that the limits of @xmath63 can be identified with the volume fractions of random loose packing ( rlp ) and random close packing ( rcp ) in the following way : @xmath64 now we can rewrite as @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "below , eq .",
    "will be useful as a fitting function for our simulation data .",
    "we remark that the ideal quadron solution is a very rough estimation , because the main difficulty in calculation of the partition function is filtering out stable configurations . in the ideal quadron solution , a minimal filtering",
    "is performed in the sense that there is a minimal and a maximal volume per quadron so that configurations that are either too loose or too dense are filtered out .",
    "however , the number of states between these limits may be overestimated .",
    "the arch - based approach @xcite may have the capability to overcome this issue .",
    "however , in the current form no analytical equation such as is available .",
    "only numerical solutions under very simplifying assumptions are on hand , which makes a comparison of our data with this model difficult .",
    "note that there is no commonly accepted definition of the states rlp and rcp . in this paper",
    "we use these terms in the sense of eq .   and .",
    "an interesting fact is that in the framework of the ideal quadron model for @xmath67 , which is the limit of very high compactivities , the mean volume per quadron is @xmath61 , not @xmath54 .",
    "states which would have a mean volume per quadron with @xmath68 correspond to a population inversion , i.e. , states with negative granular temperature .",
    "it may be speculated that these states correlate with so - called random very loose packings states @xcite , which are states only achievable with very special protocols .",
    "a verification of this idea is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "in our simulation , we extend an existing dem code , originally developed for the investigation of the mechanical properties of granular piles consisting of two - dimensional polygonal particles @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath69th particle s position @xmath70 and orientation @xmath71 are described by newton s and euler s equations of motion : @xmath72 herein , @xmath73 is the contact force between particle @xmath69 and particle @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the corresponding torque acting on the particle ( referred to its center of mass ) , and @xmath76 is the external force acting on the particle ( e.g. ,  gravity ) .",

    "we assume external torques to be absent .    for fast determination of potential particle contacts ,",
    "the particles are surrounded by bounding boxes and we employ an incremental sort - and - update algorithm @xcite to identify overlapping bounding boxes efficiently .",
    "whenever the bounding boxes of two particles overlap , we use a closest - feature algorithm @xcite from virtual reality and robotics applications @xcite to calculate the polygon distance . in the worst - case scenario ,",
    "the computational complexity is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of polygon features ( corners and edges ) .",
    "however , the typical behavior , whenever a good guess from the last timestep is available , is the calculation of the polygon distance in constant time @xmath81 , independently of the polygon edge number .",
    "figure [ fig : forcegeometrie ] shows a sketch of two particles in contact .",
    "the contact point @xmath82 between two particles is defined as the midpoint of the line between @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for the force calculation , we define some quantities first : the characteristic length @xmath85 ( note that @xmath86 is not the length of the contact line ) , the reduced mass @xmath87 and the reduced tangential mass , including the moments of inertia    ( color online ) sketch of two polygonal particles in contact . the normal and tangential direction of a collision is determined by the contact line ( green ) , the contact point is defined as the middle of the contact line . ]    @xmath88    the relative tangential velocity at the contact point @xmath82 is @xmath89 where @xmath90 are the velocities of the particles and @xmath91 are their angular velocities . furthermore , we define the effective penetration length as @xmath92 note that @xmath86 does not change significantly during a collision , so @xmath93 is essentially proportional to the overlap area @xmath94",

    "consequently , the contact force vanishes from this moment on .    we used the cundall - strack model @xcite for modelling tangential forces . at the beginning of the collision ,",
