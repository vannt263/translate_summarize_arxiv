    "we consider bilayer qsh systems , such as inas / gasb @xcite , described by the bhz hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the important property of these systems is that there is a crossing of electron and hole landau levels as a function of magnetic field at @xmath4 @xcite [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : landau_levels_en_mom](a ) ] , where the band inversion is removed . near this",
    "crossing the single - particle hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath5 e_g(kl_b^2 ) , \\label{llham}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the energy - momentum dispersion of landau levels and @xmath7 are the electron creation operators for the lowest electron and hole landau levels .",
    "here we have fixed the total filling factor of the landau levels @xmath8 , and utilized the fact that the momentum @xmath9 in the landau level wavefunctions is directly connected to the position @xmath10 in the real space .",
    "importantly , the spin and layer degrees of freedom are locked with each other , so that the pseudospin @xmath11 means simultaneously up ( down ) spin and upper ( lower ) layer @xcite .",
    "the fermi level is set to be at zero energy .    in the bulk",
    "the energy @xmath12 is independent of the momentum ( @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) . when approaching the edge the landau level originating from the electron ( hole ) band always disperses upwards ( downwards ) in energy .",
    "the spatial variation of @xmath17 occurs within a characteristic length scale @xmath18 , which depends on the details of the edge , but due to topological reasons @xmath19 reaches extremely large values ( on the order of the energy separation between the bulk landau levels ) close to the edge @xcite . therefore , for the magnetic fields @xmath14 , @xmath17 goes through zero near the edge , yielding to the helical edge states [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : landau_levels_en_mom](b ) ] . on the other hand for @xmath20",
    "the edge is gapped in the non - interacting theory [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : landau_levels_en_mom](c ) ] .    the electron - electron interactions @xmath21 are described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is obtained by projecting the coulomb interactions to the subspace generated by the wavefunctions of the lowest landau levels @xcite . here",
    ", we assumed that the higher landau levels are energetically separated from the lowest ones by an energy gap larger than the characteristic energy scale of the coulomb interactions @xmath24 .",
    "we find that this assumption can be satisfied with the material parameters corresponding to inas / gasb bilayers @xcite .",
    "to find the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath25 , we consider states where the local direction of the pseudospin @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) varies in space .",
    "because the hamiltonian is translationally invariant in the @xmath28-direction , we assume that @xmath26 is independent of @xmath28 @xcite . by further noticing that the @xmath10-dependence translates to a momentum dependence of the pseudospin @xmath29",
    ", we can express our ansatz for the ground state many - particle wavefunction as a slater determinant @xmath30\\rangle$ ] , where for each momentum @xmath9 we create an electron with pseudospin pointing along @xmath31 . to compute the ground state ,",
    "we need to minimize the energy functional for such kind of pseudospin texture @xcite . for the energy functional we obtain @xcite @xmath32 here @xmath33/4 $ ] and @xmath34 are the interaction coefficients , which characterize the anisotropy of the interactions within a layer and between the layers .",
    "we start by considering an infinite system . in this case , the pseudospin direction @xmath26 is spatially homogeneous . by minimizing the energy - functional ( [ energyfunctional ] ) , we find that the pseudospin direction @xmath35 is determined by the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath36 acts as an effective magnetic field preferring the pseudospin direction along @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the interactions prefer the pseudospin directions within the ( x , y)-plane ( @xmath39 ) , and the energy cost to rotate the pseudospin so that it points along the @xmath40-direction is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , as a balance between these two competing effects , the direction of the pseudospin is tilted away from the @xmath2-plane , resulting in the three distinct phases of the system , which are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] . for sufficiently large @xmath42",
    ", we see that @xmath43 , meaning that only one layer is occupied . the phases @xmath44 ( _ uncorrelated helical qh phase _ ) and @xmath45 ( _ trivial qh phase _ ) are topologically distinct from each other . for @xmath46 and @xmath44 the system supports helical edge modes ( the spin - resolved chern numbers are @xmath47 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the regime @xmath48 and @xmath45 , the edge is completely gapped ( the spin - resolved chern numbers are @xmath49 ) . between these two phases is the helical qh exciton condensate phase , where @xmath50 and thus @xmath51 . in this phase",
    "the direction of the pseudospin projection onto the @xmath52-plane is determined spontaneously . because the pseudospin in this system labels spin and layer index simultaneously , this phase has simultaneously spontaneous in - plane spin polarization and spontaneous interlayer phase coherence .",
    "the bulk gap for single particle excitations @xmath53 can be calculated using hartree - fock linearization @xcite @xmath54 additionally to the single particle excitations , the helical qh exciton condensate supports collective excitations @xcite : the neutral pseudospin waves ( goldstone mode ) give rise to spin and counterflow charge superfluidity , and the lowest energy charged excitations are topological pseudospin textures , which carry fractional charge @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 are the pseudospin resolved filling factors of the different landau levels .",
    "the energy required to create these charged excitations is slightly lower than @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we point out that although @xmath57 are topologically distinct phases , the bulk gap for creating charged excitations never closes , when one tunes from one phase to the other by controlling @xmath36 .",
    "this is possible because the pseudospin rotation symmetry , which protects the existence of spin - resolved chern numbers as topological numbers , is spontaneously broken in the helical exciton condensate phase .",
    "the interacting bhz model for bilayers shows somewhat similar behavior also at zero magnetic field , where a trivial insulator phase can be connected to a quantum spin hall insulator phase without closing of the bulk gap , because of an intermediate phase where the time - reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "it is also experimentally known that the exciton condensate phase with @xmath58 can be smoothly connected to uncorrelated qh state with @xmath59 and @xmath60 in conventional qh bilayers @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of inas / gasb bilayers in the qh regime @xcite are consistent with this prediction , because no gap closing has been observed as a function of magnetic field .",
    "we now turn to the description of the ground state pseudospin texture @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 \\cos(\\phi)$ ] and @xmath63 \\sin(\\phi)$ ] at the edge .",
    "( the ground state will be degenerate with respect to the choice of @xmath64 . ) as discussed above close to the edge @xmath19 takes large values , because the edge states are topologically protected to exist at all energies between the lowest landau levels and higher ones .",
    "therefore close to the edge @xmath65 . on the other hand , in the bulk @xmath66 .",
    "this means that there always exists a domain wall , where @xmath67 rotates from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "although the existence of the domain wall is a robust topological property of the system , the detailed shape of @xmath70 and the length scale @xmath71 , where this rotation happens , depend on the details of the sample @xcite .",
    "the ground states in the uncorrelated helical qh phase ( @xmath72 ) and helical qh exciton condensate phase ( @xmath73 ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitations ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the existence of spontaneous interlayer phase coherence , which distinguishes the two different phases of matter , also has deep consequences on the nature of the low - energy excitations in this system .    by using a hartree - fock linearization for the ground state ,",
    "we find that the single particle excitations are gapped also close to the edge , and the magnitude of the energy gap is determined by the coulomb energy scale @xmath74 . however , similarly as for the case of a coherent domain wall in qh ferromagnetic state in graphene @xcite , the lowest energy edge excitations are not the single - particle ones .",
    "namely , the ground state is degenerate with respect to the choice of @xmath64 , and therefore in accordance with the goldstone s theorem the system supports low - energy excitations described by spatial variation of @xmath75 . due to the general relationship between the electric and topological charge densities in qh ferromagnets @xcite @xmath76}{\\partial y}\\label{eq : charge_density}\\ ] ] these excitations also carry charge , which is localized at the edges of the sample . in this section",
    "we illustrate these excitations in a closed system obtained by connecting the ends of the sample to form a narrow cylinder with width @xmath77 and circumference @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we start by considering this kind of closed system , where @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : excitations ] ) .",
    "this geometry is topologically equivalent to a corbino ring , which has been experimentally realized for qh exciton condensates @xcite . using eqs .",
    "( [ energyfunctional ] ) and ( [ eq : charge_density ] ) we find that the lowest energy excitations correspond to rotation of @xmath80 by @xmath81 and carry a net charge within one of the edges @xcite .",
    "they have an energy @xmath82 in the uncorrelated phase and @xmath83 deep in the helical exciton condensate phase . here",
    "@xmath84 characterizes the cost of exchange energy caused by @xmath85 @xcite .    in the uncorrelated phase",
    "these excitations have a charge @xmath86 . by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : excitations ] , we notice that because the spin points along @xmath40-direction in the bulk , there is no rotation happening in the bulk .",
    "this means that we can choose separate fields @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the two edges , so that these excitations can be created independently on the different edges much as in graphene @xcite .",
    "the situation is dramatically different in the helical qh exciton condensate phase .",
    "there , the elementary excitations in a closed system have a charge @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitations ] , a charge @xmath90 on one of the edges is always connected to the opposite charge on the other edge by a stripe of rotated bulk pseudospins . breaking the bulk pseudospin configuration costs an energy comparable to the coulomb energy , and thus isolated charges",
    "can not be observed at low energies .",
    "this means that this type of charged edge excitations in the helical qh exciton condensate phase are confined .",
    "it is illustrative to consider what happens to the excitations in the helical qh exciton condensate , when the width of the sample is increased .",
    "namely , the excitation energy increases proportionally to the width of the sample @xmath83 and eventually for @xmath91 it becomes energetically favorable instead of having a large area of rotating spins between two edges to create a bulk meron ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkmeron ] ) .",
    "this resembles the physics of quarks , where the growing separation of a quark - antiquark pair eventually results in the creation of a new quark - antiquark pair between them .",
    "to predict experimentally measurable consequences of the charge confinement , we consider nonlocal transport in an open system . by considering the time - dependent field theory for the pseudospin for a reasonably narrow sample in the helical qh exciton condensate phase we arrive at an effective one - dimensional hamiltonian @xcite @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the pseudospin stiffness and @xmath94 describes the interlayer capacitance per unit area , which is strongly enhanced from the electrostatic value by the exchange interactions .",
    "the one - dimensional charge densities in the different edges ( labeled 1 and 2 ) @xmath95 are always opposite and determined by a single field @xmath80 , highlighting the confinement of the charged edge excitations .",
    "the one - dimensional theory describes a luttinger liquid , and the so - called luttinger parameter @xmath96 in the convention used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is given by @xmath97 the luttinger parameter in quantum hall systems determines the conductance for ideal contacts @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "because the pseudospin waves are charge neutral in the bulk , conductance decreases with @xmath77 as @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to notice that in this system @xmath100 describes the conductance for a counterflow / drag geometry , where opposite currents are flowing in the two edges .",
    "the helical qh exciton condensate phase does not support net transport current as long as the voltages @xmath101 are small compared to @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "this automatically leads to a remarkable transport property that characterizes the helical qh exciton condensate phase .",
    "namely , by considering a nonlocal transport geometry shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : measurement ] ) ( a ) , where a drive current is applied on one of the edges and a resulting drag current is measured on the opposite edge , we find that necessarily @xmath103 at small voltages . this should be contrasted to the uncorrelated helical phase , where the charged edge excitations are deconfined . in that case",
    ", one has two independent luttinger liquid theories for the two edges @xcite , and therefore one expects only a weak drag current due to the coulomb force acting between the charges . for @xmath104",
    ", we expect that this effect is negligible compared to drag current in the confined phase .",
    "finally , to estimate the critical current @xmath105 , where the relation @xmath103 breaks down , we notice that the maximum voltage is determined by the gap @xmath106 . by using reasonable estimates",
    "@xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 nm , @xmath112 km / s @xcite , we find @xmath113 na .",
    "in summary , we have predicted the existence of a helical qh exciton condensate state in band - inverted electron - hole bilayers . we have shown that the counterpropagating edge modes give rise to a ground state pseudospin texture , where the polar angle of the pseudospin magnetization @xmath114 rotates from the boundary value @xmath68 to the bulk value @xmath69 along the direction perpendicular to the edge .",
    "low - energy charged excitations can be created by letting the azimuthal angle of the pseudospin polarization @xmath80 to rotate along the edge . remarkably , in a sufficiently narrow hall bar these charged edge excitations are confined in the presence of spontaneous interlayer phase - coherence ( @xmath115 ) : a charge on one of the edges always gives rise to the opposite charge on the other edge , and thus isolated charges can not be observed at low energies .",
    "moreover , we predict the possibility to control @xmath69 with a magnetic field and gate voltages .",
    "this allows to study a confinement - deconfinement transition , which occurs simultaneously with the bulk phase - transition between the helical qh exciton condensate phase ( @xmath115 ) and the uncorrelated helical qh phase ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the helical qh exciton condensate phase can be experimentally probed using josephson - like interlayer tunneling and counterflow superfluidity @xcite . moreover , because the pseudospin in this system describes simultaneously both the spin and the layer degrees of freedom , the helical qh exciton condensate phase can also be probed using the spin superfluidity and the nmr techniques @xcite .",
    "perhaps it is even possible to use local probe techniques to image the confinement - deconfinement transition and the confinement physics as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : excitations ] and [ fig : bulkmeron ] .",
    "finally , we have shown that the charge confinement also gives rise to a remarkable new transport property .",
    "namely , a drive current applied on one of the edges gives rise to exactly opposite drag current @xmath103 at the other edge .    our results for the confinement of the edge excitations may also be applicable to the so - called canted antiferromagnetic phase , which is predicted to appear in graphene @xcite .",
    "similarly to the helical qh exciton condensate state considered in this paper , the canted antiferromagnetic phase is characterized by a spontaneously broken u(1)-symmetry in the bulk and a single edge supports only gapped meron - antimeron excitations @xcite .",
    "the phenomena of confinement stemming from the particle physics models @xcite has been studied also in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the combination of the different techniques for probing the helical qh exciton condensate phase will provide a more intuitive understanding and new perspectives on the confinement physics",
    ".    we also point out that inas / gasb bilayers is a promising system for superconducting applications , and edge - mode superconductivity has already been experimentally demonstrated in the qsh regime @xcite . in the presence of superconducting contacts ,",
    "the helical qh exciton condensate may provide a new route for realizing exotic nonlocal josephson effects and non - abelian excitations , such as parafermions @xcite .    _",

    "this requirement is satisfied because the possible charges of the vortices are @xmath55 and @xmath285 .    in all arguments",
    "so far the whole pseudospin texture was considered to be smooth on the scale of @xmath146 .",
    "however , it turns out that it is possible to relax this assumption .",
    "namely , if one considers the type of pseudospin textures shown in fig .  4 in the main text it is actually enough that _ the pseudospin texture is smooth on the scale of @xmath146 in the bulk region between the localized charges_. close to the edge it may vary arbitrarily sharply . to understand this consider first the type of smooth pseudospin texture shown in fig .  4 , such that charge @xmath286 appears at one edge and @xmath287 at the other .",
    "we can now deform one end of the pseudospin texture in such a way that the rest of the pseudospin texture remains smooth .",
    "then , there is still charge @xmath286 localized on one edge and the bulk is charge neutral , which means that a charge @xmath287 necessarily remains at the other edge although it is no longer smooth on the scale of @xmath146 .",
    "the values of the polarization charges in this system are therefore fully topological .",
    "no local perturbation in the pseudospin texture can change the charges appearing at the edges .",
    "only a global perturbation which connects the fractionally charged excitations may give rise to redistribution of the charges and modify their values from @xmath283 .",
    "we have numerically verified the statements based on the analytical arguments given above . for this purpose",
    "we have inserted an order parameter term @xmath288 \\label{orderparameter - num}\\ ] ] to the bhz hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : single_particle ] ) ] . the charge density associated with the excitation @xmath289",
    "can be numerically computed by calcuting the difference between the charge densities for pseudospin textures @xmath290 $ ] , @xmath291 \\cos[\\phi(x)]$ ] , @xmath292 \\sin[\\phi(x)]$ ] , where @xmath293 ( excited state ) and @xmath294 ( ground state ) .",
    "here we have introduced a length scale @xmath295 where the phase @xmath80 rotates over @xmath81 .",
    "the charge of an elementary excitation @xmath296 is obtained by integrating the charge density over a period @xmath295 in @xmath28-direction and over the width of the domain wall in @xmath10-direction .",
    "if we choose @xmath297 the charge of the excitation according to our analytic arguments should be @xmath298 .",
    "however , @xmath295 allows us also to control how fast the pseudospin direction changes in such a way that it influences the system everywhere in the bulk .",
    "therefore , if we choose @xmath299 it is possible to excite the higher landau levels everywhere in the bulk so that topological protection is destroyed , and we can study how this affects the charge of the excitation",
    ". additionally we can illustrate the topological nature of the charge of the pseudospin texture by demonstrating that deformations of the pseudospin texture appearing only close to the edge do not affect the value of @xmath296 .",
    "for this purpose we define @xmath300 in such a way that @xmath301 allows to control the length scale where the angle @xmath114 is varied from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in the vicinity of the edge . based on our topological arguments the charge",
    "@xmath296 should be independent of @xmath301 .",
    "( we assume @xmath302 . )",
    "the numerical results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : charge ] .",
    "as can be seen from these figures for smooth pseudospin textures the numerical results are in agreement with the analytical expectations .",
    "moreover , @xmath296 does not depend on @xmath301 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : charge](a ) ] in agreement with the topological argument . on the other hand , if we deform the pseudospin texture in such a way that it rotates fast in the bulk by choosing @xmath303 it is possible to excite the higher landau levels everywhere in the bulk so that topological protection is destroyed .",
    "this results in redistribution of the charges giving rise to deviations of @xmath296 from the value @xmath283 [ fig .",

    "<S> we show that the interlayer correlations lead to formation of a _ helical quantum hall exciton condensate state_. in contrast to the chiral edge states of the quantum hall exciton condensate in electron - electron bilayers , existence of the counterpropagating edge modes results in formation of a ground state spin - texture not supporting gapless single - particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this feature has deep consequences for the low energy behavior of the system . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the charged edge excitations in a sufficiently narrow hall bar are _ confined _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e.  a charge on one of the edges always gives rise to an opposite charge on the other edge . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that magnetic field and gate voltages allow to control confinement - deconfinement transition of charged edge excitations , which can be probed with nonlocal conductance . </S>",
    "<S> confinement - deconfinement transitions are of great interest , not least because of their possible significance in shedding light on the confinement problem of quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of the electron - electron interactions for the experimentally accessible topological media is best appreciated in quantum hall ( qh ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> the fractionally charged quasiparticles have been studied at the fractional filling factors @xcite , and the non - abelian excitations of more exotic qh states may eventually lead to a revolution in quantum computing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , coulomb interactions play a crucial role also in the case of the integer filling factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , interactions create a qh ferromagnetic ground state at @xmath0 even in the absence of zeeman energy . in such systems , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 spin rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken , resulting in the low - energy excitations being spin waves and charged topological spin textures , skyrmions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a small symmetry - breaking zeeman field does not change the low - energy excitations qualitatively .    in qh bilayer systems </S>",
    "<S> the role of spin is played by the layer index ( pseudospin ) @xcite . in this case the @xmath1 pseudospin rotation symmetry is explicitly broken by the interactions , as they are larger within the layers than between the layers . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions favor the pseudospin orientations in @xmath2-plane , where the direction is chosen spontaneously ( spontaneous @xmath3 symmetry breaking ) so that the qh bilayers realize an easy - plane ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> since the spontaneously chosen direction in the @xmath2-plane corresponds to a spontaneous interlayer phase coherence , this easy - plane ferromagnetic state is equivalent to an exciton condensate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the qh ferromagnet and qh exciton condensate in electron - electron bilayers support a single chiral edge mode . </S>",
    "<S> however the two landau levels may also support counterpropagating edge modes . </S>",
    "<S> the natural hosts of such kind of qh states are systems supporting quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect @xcite due to inverted electron - hole bandstructure . in these materials </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field allows to tune through the landau level crossing @xcite , where we expect to find a qh state with spontaneously - broken ( pseudo)spin - rotation symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we argue that there exist four different experimentally accessible pseudospin ferromagnetic states , determined by spontaneously broken symmetry [ su(2 ) in single layer and u(1 ) in bilayer systems ] and the edge structure [ chiral or helical ] . </S>",
    "<S> all these possibilities are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bilayers ] .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we concentrate on the helical qh exciton condensate state [ broken u(1 ) symmetry and helical edge structure ] . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that in this system the charged edge excitations in a sufficiently narrow hall bar are confined : a charge on one of the edges is always connected to the opposite charge on the other edge through the bulk by a stripe of rotated pseudospins , and thus low - energy isolated charged excitations can not be observed . </S>",
    "<S> the gapless single - particle excitations are prohibited since the electron - electron interactions lead to an edge reconstruction and opening of a single - particle gap @xcite . however , unlike it happens in the existing examples , the helical exciton condensate creates long - range correlations between edges . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a magnetic field and gate voltages can be used to tune in and out of the exciton condensate phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus this system provides a unique opportunity to study a confinement - deconfinement transition , similar to the one which is hypothesized to liberate the quarks from their color confinement at extremely high temperatures or densities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the confined and deconfined phases can be distinguished using nonlocal conductance . </S>"
