    "over the last decade the ` dynamical mean field ' method @xcite has emerged from earlier investigations@xcite of the infinite dimensional limit as a very useful tool for theoretical investigation of correlated electron systems .",
    "it provides ( within a certain approximation ) a nonperturbative means of obtaining the electron self - energy and spectral function , and allows treatment of inelastic and thermal effects on the same footing as ground state energetics .",
    "it has revealed new insights into the physics of the mott transition,@xcite of ` colossal ' magnetoresistance manganites,@xcite of plutonium @xcite and many other systems , and may be combined with lmto band theory ( for reviews see refs . ) to treat correlation effects in realistic models .",
    "as originally formulated @xcite the dynamical mean field method is a _ local _ approximation .",
    "the problem which one actually solves is a single - site model self - consistently embedded in a medium .",
    "the results are an exact representation of the physics of lattice models only in a limit of infinite coordination number.@xcite while the method captures local physics very well , the treatment of intersite correlations is an important open issue .",
    "attempts to formulate a controlled expansion about the infinite coordination limit have not led to useful and tractable expressions .",
    "an alternative approach focuses on the self - consistent embedding of a larger cluster in a medium , hettler98,moukouri00,lichtenstein00,kotliar02,biroli02,bolech02,aryanpour03 and is closely related to attempts to extend the ` single - site cpa ' approximation to more than one site.@xcite most of the approaches published to date involve choosing a specific cluster ( subset of sites of the actual lattice of interest ) as well as a specific embedding ( geometry of connection of cluster sites to sites of the medium ) .",
    "an alternative ( ` e - dmft ' ) method involves using hybrid boson - fermion methods to treat two - particle intersite correlations @xcite and has had some success .    while these approaches have led to a number of interesting results ( for recent examples",
    "see e.g. refs .  ) , one worries that the choice of specific geometry both of the cluster and its embedding in the medium may bias the physics .",
    "further , the real - space - cluster - based methods sometimes lead to self energies which are non - causal for some momenta and frequencies .",
    "this is regarded as a grave defect of the method and its cure is an important open problem .    in this paper",
    "we put forward an alternative point of view on the question of extending dynamical mean field theory to include intersite correlations .",
    "our motivation is as follows .",
    "the original local dynamical mean field method , although often described in terms of a site self consistently embedded in a medium , may also be described as the ` momentum - independent self - energy approximation ' .",
    "it amounts to    ( _ i _ ) replacing the general position - dependent self - energy @xmath0 * *  * * @xmath1by the on - site value @xmath2 , and    ( _ ii _ ) providing a prescription for computing @xmath2 from the solution of a single - site quantum impurity model .",
    "considering the problem more generally , one may write @xmath3 as an expansion in orthogonal functions and truncate the expansion at a finite order , thereby replacing a general function by a small number of frequency - dependent coefficients , which may be determined from the solution of a several site _ fictive impurity model _ : `` fictive '' because although the several - site impurity model can be regarded as a cluster self - consistently embedded in a medium , this cluster need not be a sub - cluster of the physical lattice considered",
    ". it should be viewed as merely a device for computing the self - energy functions of interest .",
    "the general idea of taking an abstract view of the ` impurity ' or cluster in the dynamical mean field method is not new .",
    "it is mentioned in ref .  , and has recently been elegantly exploited by kotliar and co - workers to link band theory and the dynamical mean field method.@xcite it is also the basis of an approach to the practical solution of the single - site dmft equations put forward by potthoff.@xcite here we apply the idea to the study of spatial correlations .",
    "the idea that the cluster model is merely an algorithm for computing coefficients in a low - order orthogonal function expansion of a physical self energy gives insight into the ` causality violations ' which sometimes occur in dynamical mean field schemes . in the context of cluster extensions of dynamical mean field theory",
    ", the term ` causality violation ' means that for some momenta and frequencies , the imaginary part of the approximate lattice self - energy computed from the cluster approximation has the ` wrong ' sign .",
    "we shall argue that this is nothing but the ` ringing ' phenomenon familiar from fourier analysis : if one approximates a non - negative but sharply peaked function by a few low order terms in an orthogonal function expansion , the approximant will change sign .",
    "we shall use the analogy to propose several simple cures .",
    "we note that the ` dca ' formalism used for example in refs",
    ".   corresponds to a choice of orthogonal functions which are everywhere non - negative but which have no common support . in this sense , ` ringing ' is absent , so the method is plainly causal , but discontinuities in momentum space occur .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the formalism we shall use . in section iii we present examples of the use of several - site impurity models to calculate the self - energy of the two dimensional hubbard model .",
    "section iv discusses ` causality violations ' and possible cures .",
    "section v is a conclusion .",
    "we study a model of electrons moving on a @xmath4-dimensional lattice with short ranged hopping amplitudes ( described by a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath5 ) and interactions ( described by a hamiltonian @xmath6 ) .",

    "the formal development of the previous section suggests that the causality violations may be thought of as an example of the ` ringing ' phenomenon familiar from fourier analysis .",
    "any straightforward real - space cluster scheme corresponds to using some set of orthogonal functions to expand  the momentum dependence of the exact lattice self - energy @xmath97 in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ sigapprox ] ) .",
    "the first term in an orthogonal function expansion is @xmath98 which is everywhere positive , so the local approximation is guaranteed to be causal , but all of the other orthogonal functions change sign over the brillouin zone , so an expansion which is truncated at low order is not guaranteed to be positive everywhere in the zone . in particular , if at fixed @xmath99 the function @xmath100 has a strong , narrow peak at some momentum @xmath101 , then truncating an orthogonal function expansion at a low order will produce a self - energy whose imaginary part changes sign . as noted above , in the `` dca '' approach @xcite this problem",
    "is avoided , at the expense of introducing discontinuities in the momentum space representations of @xmath14 and @xmath102 , by choosing the orthogonal functions to be a tiling of the brillouin zone by rectangular filters .",

    "we observe the acausal behavior does not occur if only the first neighbor term is retained ( dashed line ) but does occur if both first and second neighbor terms are retained .",

    "[ one can see this behavior even in fig .",
    "fig : ipt ( b , d ) . ]",
    "as noted above the acausal behavior has ( at least in this instance ) a simple kinematic origin , which suggest that it may not occur in all circumstances .",
    "for example , at larger @xmath114 , more complicated decay channels ( e.g. one particle decaying into 3 particles and 2 holes ) with fewer kinematic constraints may become important , leading to a broadening of peaks in the momentum dependent self energy and therefore to a causal self energy .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is shown in fig [ fig : iptlargeu ] , which displays the imaginary part of the self energy calculated high frequencies in the ` ipt ' approximation at several different @xmath114-values .",
    "the broadening of the peak and the destruction of the acausal behavior suggested by the arguments above are clearly observed .",
    "we stress that the ipt is an uncontrolled approximation  however it is a computationally tractable example illustrating a phenomenon which we suspect is of more general significance .",
    "= 0.8      we have argued that any cluster extension of the dynamical mean field method amounts to a scheme for computing the coefficients in a low - order orthogonal function expansion of the electronic self - energy .",
    "this suggests that the reported causality difficulties are generic and inescapable : _ no _ truncation of an orthogonal function expansion is guaranteed to lead to an everywhere non - negative approximant for an arbitrary test function .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the impurity model itself  is causal ; it is only the resulting lattice self - energy which may have acausal features .",
    "the discussion of the previous subsection suggests that the acausal behavior is ` ringing ' is associated with a relatively large peak near a particular momentum .",
    "it is possible that such a peak could be physically important , occurring for example at a fermi surface ` hot spot ' in a system close to a quantum critical point .",
    "in such a case , long ranged interactions are evidently physically crucial , and modeling them with a local model is simply inappropriate .",
    "however , as seen in the explicit calculations present above , peaks in @xmath115 which are both sharp and large relative to typical values of @xmath116 are more often associated with band edges and extremal frequencies .",
    "these regions of @xmath99 and @xmath101 are not particularly important for energetics , suggesting that the acausality is simply a minor technical annoyance . in what follows we consider methods of removing it .",
    "we first note that in particular temperature regimes of particular problems ( for example , the double exchange model on the simple cubic lattice and at not too low temperatures @xcite ) the ringing phenomenon might not occur .",
    "we also note that a clever choice of expansion functions may mitigate the severity of the problem .",
    "for example , we saw in the hubbard model the difficulties arise from narrow peaks centered near the band edges @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
    "an expansion based on the functions @xmath119 and a function orthogonal to both @xmath120 and @xmath121 but strongly peaked near @xmath122 and @xmath123 might have a wider range of applicability than the straightforward harmonic expansion .",
    "a more general approach is to filter the self - energy , for example by convolving it with a function to smooth out any sharp peaks and then approximating the smoothed function by a low order harmonic expansion .",
    "let us make this approach more precise , writing eq .",
    "( [ sigapprox ] ) as@xmath124where @xmath125 and @xmath126 @xmath127 are the fourier components of the smoothing function . carrying through the development of the previous section leads to @xmath128so that the quantum impurity model acts to reproduce the smoothed green s functions of the theory .",
    "( we note that sum rules typically constrain the large @xmath99 behavior of the local green function , so that one must choose @xmath125 in order to have a consistent representation at least within the simple impurity models of which we have studied ) .",
    "fig : imp10 shows the results obtained using different choices of simple filtering coefficients in the low order self energies discussed in the previous section .",
    "= 0.8    the straightforward filtering approach gives up some fraction of the intersite correlations in order to guarantee a causal theory .",
    "a more sophisticated possibility would be a frequency dependent filtering .",
    "we saw from the low order perturbation calculation on the hubbard model that the self - energy was only very strongly peaked in momentum space for very high or very low energy states , where decay kinematics constrained all states involved to be near the band edges .",
    "these states are not very important to energetics .",
    "one may therefore filter out only these by setting an arbitrary frequency scale @xmath129 and @xmath130 and writing e.g. @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "we note that this filtering may be performed _ ex - post - facto : _ one may solve the impurity model , determine the band - edge regions where filtering is required , and then re - solve the impurity model with filtering only in these regions .",
    "fig : filter shows the results obtained using the above frequency - dependent filtering with different choices of parameters . here , we take @xmath132 , and four - impurity model is self - consistently solved .",
    "it is clearly shown that @xmath133 are reduced at higher frequency region where acausal behavior has been observed in the second order perturbation theory approximation , while there is not much effect in the low frequency region .",
    "= 0.8    a still more sophisticated approach would be to mix different harmonic components , so that low order terms were modified only if higher order terms were important ( i.e. if filtering were really needed ) .",
    "this approach is most helpful if a - priori knowledge of the locations of sharp momentum - space structures is available .",
    "indeed , the calculations presented above of the behavior of the hubbard model strongly suggest that the singularities are associated with the top and bottom of the band , i.e. with states around @xmath134 or @xmath135 . to define this transformation we begin from the harmonic expansion , eq .",
    "( [ sigapprox ] ) , and then introduce a transformation which mixes the harmonic coefficients , so that@xmath136and the self consistency equation becomes@xmath137    we have however not yet explored these more complicated filtering procedures",
    "in this paper we have argued that one should take a more abstract view of cluster extensions of the dynamical mean field method ; regarding them as algorithms for computing frequency dependent coefficients in an orthogonal function expansion of the electron self - energy .",
    "this approach renders moot the debates about ` correct ' choice of cluster and embedding , and clarifies the meaning of the ` causality violation ' encountered in real - space - cluster extensions of the dynamical mean field method .",
    "we have suggested that the causality violation is in most cases a minor technical problem which can be cured  if needed by any of a variety of ` filtering ' procedures .",
    "several questions arise , for which further research would be desirable .",
    "one is the question of the correct choice of interaction terms in the `` fictive impurity model '' .",
    "this issue has been discussed in the context of on - site interactions , especially in connection with the `` dca'',@xcite and , for longer ranged interactions in the context of the e - dmft approach @xcite but deserves more attention in the context of the more conventional orthogonal function expansions .",
    "a second key issue is the origin of the ` causality violations ' .",
    "we have shown that in simple perturbative models ( chosen because exact expressions for the momentum dependent self energy are available ) the violations are an example of the familiar ` ringing ' phenomenon , and moreover occur mainly in band edge regions of little kinematical importance .",
    "the issue however deserves further exploration in less trivial contexts .",
    "a third open problem is the question of which approximants to the self - energy are representable by impurity models .",
    "we have presented arguments ( substantiated by low - order perturbative calculations in different limits ) indicating that straightforward orthogonal function expansions , with and without filtering , are representable .",
    "however , one might imagine that more complicated approximate representations of the self - energy might be advantageous in some problems .",
    "we do not at present have a general framework for determining the circumstances under which a general approximant to @xmath110 is representable in terms of an impurity model .",
    "the issue of different choices of filtering function seems also likely to benefit from further research . in particular",
    ", it seems likely that one can more efficiently exploit the observation that the acausality is associated mainly with the @xmath138 and @xmath139 . finally , applying the method to a wider range of models , to explore which choices lead to good representations of the physics of interest , is an urgent task .",
