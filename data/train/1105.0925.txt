    "the dynamical behavior of quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium offers several open questions . in terms of transport properties , for example",

    "the interest in the subject has been further reinforced by experiments with magnetic compounds , where ballistic transport of heat has been reported  @xcite .",
    "another stimulating scenario appears in the context of experiments with optical lattices  @xcite , where the dynamics of strongly correlated quantum systems can be investigated for long times . here , the possibility of studying the problem of thermalization in isolated quantum systems  @xcite has in part motivated the renewed interest in this topic of research  @xcite .    in the present work we are interested in the quench dynamics of one - dimensional systems of interacting spins-1/2 .",
    "we focus on a particular initial state corresponding to a sharp domain wall where the spins point up in the first half of the chain and down in the other half .",
    "the experimental realization of such inhomogeneous states requires a magnetic field gradient , which has been realized in an optical lattice loaded with atoms in two hyperfine states  @xcite .",
    "the domain wall state was considered before in numerical studies of magnetization transport in antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 xxz chains  @xcite , where using the adaptive time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group method , a sharp suppression of transport was verified for large interactions .",
    "it also appeared in studies of the dynamics of a spinon in an external magnetic field  @xcite and was used in numerical comparisons of transport behavior in integrable and nonintegrable systems  @xcite . in the context of thermalization , the dynamics of a sharp domain wall in the gapped phase of the xxz chain was studied using algebraic bethe ansatz in  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a domain wall state was investigated analytically in  @xcite and  @xcite for the xx model and numerically employing the truncated wigner approximation for the quantum sine - gordon model  @xcite .",
    "the domain wall in the xx model and the luttinger liquid was found to spread out ballistically into a current carrying steady state  @xcite . in a spin - chain ,",
    "current flow implies a rotation in space of the transverse component of the spins . as a result , the transverse spin correlation function in these simple models were found to reach a nonequilibrium steady state which showed spatial oscillations at a wavelength inversely related to the magnitude of the current  @xcite .",
    "as back - scattering interactions were added , the current was found to decrease , and consequently , the wavelength of the oscillations in the transverse spin correlation function was found to increase  @xcite .",
    "these results are further explored here taking into account both integrable and nonintegrable systems .",
    "the approach is to study the time - evolution numerically employing expokit  @xcite .",

    "the latter are realized by adding a single - site impurity field or by adding next - nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "the wavelength of the oscillations of the transverse spin correlation function increases with the ising interaction for the three models .",
    "more unexpected are the results for current and magnetization for the chaotic models . for the integrable model , the behavior is predictable . as the ising interaction increases ,",
    "the eigenstates of the system become spatially more localized , which reflects in the motion of the excitations : the spin current decreases and the decay of the absolute local magnetization slows down . for large interactions ,",
    "the same tendency is verified for the chaotic models , whereas surprises appear as the strength @xmath4 of the ising interaction changes from zero to small values . for the model with impurity",
    ", the addition of a small interaction leads to the onset of chaos , which is followed by a significant increase of the level of spatial delocalization of the eigenstates .",
    "contrary to that , the magnitude of the current and the decay rate of the magnetization decrease .",
    "in the case of next - nearest - neighbor couplings , the system is chaotic even in the absence of ising interaction ( provided that the ratio between next - nearest- and nearest - neighbor couplings is sufficiently large ) . adding @xmath4 contracts the eigenstates , whereas , quite counterintuitively , the spin current increases and the decay of the absolute local magnetization is enhanced .    for the model with impurity ,",
    "the opposite behavior between delocalization and dynamical spreading of excitations may be an indication of the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport .",

    "system size : @xmath67 , subspace @xmath33 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : ipr ]    for the three models , the behavior is the same as @xmath20 increases from 0.5 to 1.0 : the eigenstates become more localized .",
    "this is reflected in the dynamics of the three systems : the excitations become more localized , which decreases the magnitude of the spin current and slows down the decay of local magnetization ( while the velocity of the domain wall front increases ) .",
    "however , as @xmath20 changes from 0.0 to 0.5 , this correspondence remains valid only for the integrable system , whereas for the other two models orthogonal behaviors are seen :    \\(i ) in the case of the system with impurity , the addition of interaction is followed by a crossover to chaos , which justifies the substantial increase of the value of ipr .",
    "the fact that the magnitude of the spin current decreases , going contrary to delocalization , may be indicating a transition from ballistic to diffusive transport , which should slow down the motion of the excitations .",
    "\\(ii ) the system with nn and nnn couplings is chaotic when @xmath103 and also when @xmath72 .",
    "based on the spatial contraction of the eigenstates that occurs when the ising interaction is turned on , one might expect a decline in the motion of the excitations .",
    "however , what is verified in figs .",
    "[ fig2:current ] , [ fig3:contour ] , [ fig4:magnetization ] , and [ fig5:site_magnetization ] is just the opposite .",
    "the interpretation of this counter - intuitive behavior requires further studies .",
    "it is interesting to compare the values of @xmath136 and @xmath132 .",
    "they are very similar for small @xmath20 , but differ when @xmath26 . as mentioned before , the energy of the domain wall increases with the strength of the ising interaction . at @xmath26 the energy is already very large and close to the edge of the spectrum . in systems with few - body interactions (",
    "ours have only two - body interactions ) , eigenstates with energy close to the edges of the spectrum are more localized  @xcite .",
    "thus , the eigenstates that contribute to the evolution of the domain wall state are fewer ( the numbers in the column of @xmath135 decrease significantly from @xmath72 to @xmath113 ) and also more localized than those participating in the evolution of generic initial states ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this should affect the relaxation process of the domain wall state , which should become slower for large @xmath20 .",
    "we considered a one - dimensional spin-1/2 system in both integrable and chaotic regimes .",
    "the integrable limit corresponded to a clean chain in the presence of nearest - neighbor couplings only .",
    "chaos was induced ( i ) by adding a single - site impurity field or ( ii ) by adding next - nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "the time - evolution of an initial state in the form of a sharp domain wall was studied .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics focused on transverse spin correlation function , local spin current , and local magnetization . in order to understand the behavior of these quantities",
    ", we resorted to delocalization measures ; the motivation being that usually a good picture of the static properties of a system may indicate what to expect for its time evolution .",
    "this approach served us well when dealing with the integrable model . here , as the ising interaction strength @xmath4 increases",
    ", the level of spatial delocalization of the eigenstates lowers and , as one might expect , the magnitude of the spin current decreases and the decay of the absolute value of local magnetization slows down .",
    "the same behavior was verified for the chaotic models for the case of large @xmath20 , but for small ising interaction , the level of delocalization changed in a way contrary to the change in current and magnetization . for model ( i ) , the addition of interaction leads to the onset of chaos and consequently the eigenstates further delocalize .",
    "the magnitude of the current , however , decreased .",
    "we speculate that this is due to the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport . for model ( ii ) , the system is already chaotic at @xmath25 and the eigenstates only shrink with the ising interaction .",
    "contrary to that , the motion of the excitations is enhanced , as attested by the results for spin current and local magnetization .",
    "further studies are needed to clarify this behavior ."
