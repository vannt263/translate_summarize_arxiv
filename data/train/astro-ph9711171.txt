    "since the first discovery of a @xmath1-ray burst ( grb ) in 1967 ( klebesabel et al . , 1973 ) these short outbursts of highly energetic photons have formed one of astronomy s most elusive problems . following the discovery by meegan et al .",
    "( 1992 ) of their isotropic sky distribution and inhomogeneous spatial distribution ( which excluded that grbs originate from a galactic - disk source population ) the discussion on the nature of grb sources focussed on their distances : either of order 10@xmath3 pc ( galactic halo model ) , or several gpc ( cosmological model ) .",

    ". , 1997b ) have shown that grbs are located at cosmological distances , and are thereby the most luminous photon sources known in the universe .",
    "the question of what causes grbs has now become the centerpiece of the discussion , and the detection of more optical counterparts is a key element in determining this cause .    in this letter",
    "we report on our search for a transient optical counterpart for grb970828 , based on observations made with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma , and the 3.5 m wiyn telescope on kitt peak .",
    "none was detected , down to a magnitude level @xmath2 .",
    "grb970828 was discovered with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on august 28 , 1997 , ut @xmath4 from an elliptical region centered at ra=18@xmath508@xmath629@xmath7 , dec=+59180 ( j2000 ) , with a major axis of 50 , and a minor axis of 20 ( remillard et al .",

    "the rxte / pca scanned the region of the sky around the error box of the asm burst , and detected a weak x - ray source , located in the asm error box with a 210 kev flux of 0.5 mcrab ( marshall et al .",
    "the burst was also detected with the burst and transient source experiment batse and the grb experiment on ulysses .",
    "its fluence and peak flux were @xmath8 erg @xmath9 , and @xmath10 erg @xmath9 s@xmath11 , respectively . from the difference between burst arrival times , its position was constrained to lie within a 1.62 arcminute wide annulus , that intersected the rxte error box ( hurley et al .",
    "1997 ) . in an asca observation made between aug . 29.91 and 30.85",
    "ut , a weak x - ray source was detected at an average flux level of @xmath12 erg  @xmath9  s@xmath11 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "the asca error box is centered on ra=18@xmath508@xmath6323 , dec = + 591854(j2000 ) and has a 05 radius ( murakami et al .",
    "we observed the grb error box with the prime focus camera of the wht , on 9 nights between august 28 , ut 21@xmath547@xmath6 , and september 5 , ut 22@xmath507@xmath6 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the first observation was made just over 4 hours after the @xmath1-ray burst .",
    "all observations were made with a cousins @xmath0 band filter ( bessell 1979 ) . during the first two nights and the last three nights , we used a loral 2048@xmath132048 ccd chip , with 15@xmath14 pixels , giving a field of view of 845@xmath13845 . during the intervening nights we used an eev ccd chip ( 2048@xmath134096 ) , windowed at 2048@xmath132400 , with 13.5@xmath14 pixels giving a 81@xmath1395 field of view . on august 30 two r band images",

    "1 ) we find a total of 63 objects , 36 of which are stellar , and 27 galaxies , down to @xmath0=23.8",
    ".    we have searched for variable objects by comparing the magnitudes of each star as determined for each of the images .",
    "comparison of images taken on different nights showed no variation on time scales between a day and a week in excess of 0.2 mag for @xmath1823.8 ( for the last three nights the limit on variability is 0.3 mag for @xmath1823.8 ) .",
    "comparison of three images taken on the night of august 29 to 30 showed no variations on time scales of several hours in excess of 0.2 mag for @xmath19 .",
    "the large variation in optical response of grbs ( relative to their strength in @xmath1 rays ) was already clear from a comparison between grb970228 and grb970111 . within a day",
    "after grb970228 ocurred it showed an optical afterglow at @xmath20 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ; galama et al .",
    "1997a ; pedichini et al .",
    "1997 ; guarneri et al .",
    "grb970111 was not detected in optical observations made 19 hours after it occurred ( @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , for variations in excess of 0.2 and 0.5 magnitudes , respectively , castro - tirado et al .",
    "1997 ) , in spite of the fact that its @xmath1-ray fluence ( galama et al . , 1997b ) was five times larger than that of grb970228 ( costa et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "since only one deep image was made in the week following grb970111 , its non - detection may have been the result of , e.g. , a very rapid decay of any optical afterglow , or a very slow rise thereof ( like for grb970508 , see bond 1997 ; djorgovski et al . 1997 ; sahu et al . 1997b ; galama et al .",
    "1997c ) .",
    "the non - detection ( @xmath23 for variations in excess of 0.2 magnitudes ) of grb970828 during our optical observations , which covered the time interval between 4 hours and 8 days after the burst at intervals of a day , show the very large range in optical responses of grbs in an even more striking fashion .",
    "we have used the fluence , @xmath24 ( in ergs @xmath9 ) , as a measure of the grb strength , and compared the ratio of the optical peak flux to the grb fluence of grb970828 with that of grb970508 .",
    "the latter had a peak magnitude @xmath25 ( mignoli et al . , 1997 ) , therefore the difference in optical peak luminosities between grb970508 and grb970228 is more than 4 magnitudes .",
    "the ratio of their fluences , @xmath26 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1997a , b ) .",
    "thus , we find that the optical peak response of grb970828 , with respect to its @xmath1-ray fluence , is a factor @xmath27 smaller than that of grb970508 .",
    "( compared to grb970228 the difference is a factor @xmath28 . )",
    "we have made a similar comparison with published x - ray afterglow fluxes ( @xmath29 ) for the two grbs with optical afterglow .",
    "most of these refer to the energy range 210 kev .",
    "only the rosat fluxes had to be transformed to this range ; in doing this we assumed a power law x - ray spectrum with photon index in the range 1.4 to 2.0 ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ; yoshida et al .",
    "this range leads to an uncertainty in the transformed rosat flux of less than a factor 2 .",
    "the results , in the form of the ratio @xmath30 , are summarized in fig .",
    "2 , which shows the variation of this quantity as a function of the time interval since the burst , for four bursts with published x - ray afterglow information .",
    "this figure shows that the differences in @xmath31 between these bursts are moderate ( less than an order of magnitude ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the two bursts with optical counterparts also have the highest values of @xmath31 ( for a given value of @xmath32 ) .",
    "we finally compared the peak flux in the @xmath0-band afterglows with the brightness of the x - ray afterglow . in view of their rather similar decay rates we used for the latter the 210 kev flux as measured 1 day after the grb occurred , @xmath29(1 day ) .",
    "the corresponding ratio @xmath33(1 day ) for grb970828 differs by a factor @xmath34 from that for grb970508 , and a factor @xmath35 from that for grb970228 .      a relatively succesful way of explaining the existence of grb afterglows ( at all wavelengths ) has been the so - called blastwave or fireball models ( e.g. mszros 1995 ) .",
    "these models involve the generation of a massive amount of energy in a very small , compact region , by an unexplained mechanism .",
    "the result of this dumping of energy is a relativistically expanding fireball ( blastwave ) , that collides with the interstellar or circumstellar medium and generates shocks that emit the synchrotron radiation that is observed as the afterglow .",
    "figure 3 shows the available data for grb970828 in @xmath1-rays , x - rays , @xmath36 , and @xmath0 , plus simple blastwave model fits , which are normalized to agree with the x - ray data .",
    "if we compare this with the data available for grb970228 ( wijers , rees and mszros , 1997 ) , it is striking that the decay part of the x - ray curves are virtually the same for these two bursts ( i.e. in slope _ and _ offset ) .",
    "but whereas the first stages of the optical decay for grb970228 are in good agreement with the afterglow prediction ( wijers , rees , and mszros 1997 ) , the earliest upper limit to the optical brightness of grb970828 is 300 times lower than the predicted value .",
    "the simplest spherically symmetric blastwave models for grb afterglows require that the slope of the spectrum follows from the slope of the temporal decay , once the decay curve is measured in one wavelength band and is found to be a pure power law . from that , the offset in brightness at any other waveband is fixed and the predicted flux at that waveband is hard to change .",
    "mszros , rees , & wijers ( 1997 ) showed that if the blastwave is beamed one can get different relations between spectral and temporal slopes , giving possibly much smaller offsets between the optical and x - ray light curves of the afterglow .",
    "as an example , let the energy per unit solid angle , @xmath37 , vary with angle from the jet axis , @xmath38 , as @xmath39 and the lorentz factor @xmath40 . then a temporal decay rate @xmath41 as seen here would occur for a spectrum @xmath42 , i.e.  it would rise from optical to x rays and",
    "the predicted @xmath0 band curve would be a factor 24 below the x - ray curve . at the time of our first limit this model would give @xmath43 , quite consistent with the data .",
    "another explanation , pointed out to us by dr .",
    "b. paczyski , for the non - detection of optical afterglow could be photoelectric absorption , also visible as a low - energy cut - off in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "if we assume a modest hydrogen column density of @xmath44 @xmath45 atoms @xmath9 and make the assumption that the absorbing material is at redshift @xmath46=0 , this would imply 0.34 magnitudes of extinction in the r band ( gorenstein 1975 ; cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) .    in case",
    "the absorption takes place at some redshift @xmath46 the effect is a bit more complicated .",
    "the cross section for photo - electric absorption in the ( 0.25 ) kev range depends on energy roughly as @xmath47 ( morrison and mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "then the factor by which the apparent @xmath44 , inferred from the low - energy cut - off in the x - ray spectrum , has to be increased is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "if we assume , for example , that the grb occured at a redshift of @xmath46=1 , the factor by which the apparent value of @xmath49 has to be increased would be @xmath506 .",
    "moreover , the photons in the @xmath0 band we observe would be at wavelengths near 3200   at the source , at which wavelength the interstellar absorption is approximately a factor 2.5 larger than in the @xmath0 band ( cardelli et al . , 1989 ) .",
    "these combined effects would lead , for a grb at @xmath46=1 and an apparent , moderate , @xmath44=10@xmath51 atoms @xmath9 to an @xmath0 band extinction of @xmath505 mags .",
    "if absorption is the correct explanation , a substantial fraction of grb sources ( those with a very small optical response ) would be located close to where large column densities are available , i.e. , in disks of galaxies .",
    "this would link grbs to a population of massive stars .",
    "this is expected for the failed - supernova model and for the hypernova model , proposed by woosley ( 1993 ) and paczyski ( 1997 ) , respectively . in view of the large kick velocities imparted on neutron stars at birth ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ;",
    "van den heuvel & van paradijs 1997 ) it remains to be seen whether a merging neutron star binary model would be consistent with this consequence .",
