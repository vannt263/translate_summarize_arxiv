    "calculating or estimating the lyapunov exponents provides a powerful tool for exploring most fundamental properties of dynamical systems in various physical and mechanical applications .",
    "the main advantage of this tool is that it allows one to separate chaos from order . if close trajectories in the bounded phase space diverge exponentially , then the motion is chaotic @xcite . the maximum rate of this exponential divergence is characterized by the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 is the so - called lyapunov time , representing the characteristic time of predictable dynamics .",
    "knowledge of the lyapunov time allows one to judge on the possibility for predicting the motion in chaotic domains of phase space . due to the exponential divergence of chaotic orbits ,",
    "the trajectory of any dynamical system can not be accurately predicted on timescales much greater than system s lyapunov time ; this determines the importance of methods for estimating the lyapunov exponents and times in physical and mechanical applications @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider the problem of estimating the maximum lyapunov exponent of the motion in a multiplet of interacting resonances for the case when the resonances have comparable strength . for describing nonlinear resonances",

    "is inspired by the fact that when one applies the perturbed pendulum model of nonlinear resonance in various applications , one usually finds out that the perturbations are not at all weak ; see examples in @xcite .",

    "( [ h ] ) represent the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the unperturbed pendulum , where @xmath4 is the pendulum angle ( the resonance phase angle ) , and @xmath5 is the momentum .",
    "the periodic perturbations are given by the last two terms ; @xmath6 is the phase angle of perturbation : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the perturbation frequency , and @xmath9 is the initial phase of the perturbation .",
    "the quantities @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are constants .",
    "the frequency of the pendulum small - amplitude oscillations is given by    @xmath14    an important `` adiabaticity parameter '' @xcite , measuring the relative frequency of perturbation , is    @xmath15    in the well - known phase portrait `` @xmath4@xmath5 '' of the non - perturbed pendulum , a single domain ( `` cell '' ) of librations , bounded by the non - perturbed separatrix , is present .",
    "if the perturbations are `` switched on '' ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , a section of the phase space of motion can be constructed .",

    "the chaotic layer theory has applications in various areas of physics , mechanics and , in particular , in celestial mechanics @xcite .",
    "the key role in this theory is played by the separatrix maps .",
    "they represent the motion of a system close to separatrices in a discrete way ( `` stroboscopically '' ) : system s state , set by the `` time '' and `` energy '' variables , is mapped discretely at the moments of passage of the positions of equilibrium by the pendulum describing the resonance .",
    "the motion near the separatrices of the perturbed pendulum  ( [ h ] ) with asymmetric perturbation ( @xmath26 ) is described by the so - called separatrix algorithmic map @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is given by eq .",

    "the variable @xmath6 is the phase angle of perturbation .",
    "one iteration of map  ( [ sam ] ) corresponds to one half - period of pendulum s libration or one period of its rotation .",
    "if @xmath36 ( the symmetric case ) , the separatrix algorithmic map reduces to the well - known ordinary separatrix map    @xmath37    first written in this form in @xcite ; the expression for @xmath38 @xcite is    @xmath39    formula  ( [ w ] ) differs from that given in @xcite by the term @xmath40 , which is small for @xmath41 .",
    "however , its contribution is significant when @xmath28 is small @xcite , i.e. , in the case of adiabatic chaos .",

    "( [ sm ] ) , used , e.g. , in @xcite , is    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; and    @xmath45    in @xcite , the theory of separatrix maps was shown to be legitimate for using to describe the motion near separatrices of perturbed nonlinear resonances in the full range of @xmath28 , including its low values .",
    "the half - width @xmath46 of the main chaotic layer of the separatrix map  ( [ sm1 ] ) in the case of the least perturbed border of the layer was computed as a function of @xmath28 in @xcite .",
    "the observed dependence follows a piecewise linear law with a transition point at @xmath47 .",
    "this transition takes place not only in what concerns the width of the layer , but also in other characteristics of the motion , in particular , in the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "the clear - cut sharp transition at this point manifests a qualitative distinction between two types of dynamics , `` adiabatic '' ( `` slow '' ) and `` non - adiabatic '' ( `` fast '' ) chaos @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 measures the distance between the perturbing and guiding resonances in the units of one quarter of the width of the guiding resonance .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 can be regarded as a kind of the resonance overlap parameter @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the border @xmath49 between the cases of adiabatic chaos and non - adiabatic chaos does not separate the cases of resonance overlap and resonance non - overlap : the border between the latter cases lies much higher in @xmath28 ; e.g. , in the phase space of the standard map the integer resonances start to overlap , on decreasing @xmath28 , at @xmath50 @xcite , i.e. , already at @xmath51 .",
    "let us consider a nonlinear resonance in the perturbed pendulum model with several harmonic perturbations ( i.e. , in comparison with hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) , the number of equally - spaced perturbing harmonics may be arbitrary ) :    @xmath52    thus the number of resonances in the multiplet is equal to @xmath53 .",
    "let us build a separatrix map for hamiltonian  ( [ hmulti ] ) with the symmetric perturbations ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "if the perturbations are asymmetric , the problem is more complicated , because the separatrix map becomes algorithmic , as in the triplet case @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath54 and calculating the increment of the energy variable ( analogously to the triplet case , considered in @xcite ) gives the result @xmath55 , whereas the increment of the time variable remains the same as in the triplet case .",
    "thus the separatrix map  ( [ sm ] ) is generalized to a `` multiplet separatrix map '' , given by    @xmath56    where    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the domain of validity of map  ( [ msm ] ) ( in describing the near - separatrix motion ) is expected to be usually much smaller than that of map  ( [ sm ] ) , because the natural condition of validity @xmath60 generalizes here to the condition @xmath61 .",
    "thus , if there is a lot of perturbing harmonics , the maximum allowed amplitudes @xmath62 in the multiplet case must be usually much smaller than the maximum allowed amplitude @xmath24 in the triplet case , at any given value of @xmath28 .    also note that in the case of non - adiabatic perturbation ( @xmath63 ) the multiplet map  ( [ msm ] ) can be usually replaced by the classical map  ( [ sm ] ) for the `` central '' triplet ( with @xmath64 ) , because at high values of @xmath28 the coefficients @xmath65 at @xmath66 are exponentially small with @xmath67 , with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent is defined by the formula    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the distance ( in the phase space of motion ) between two nearby initial conditions for two trajectories at the initial instant of time @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the distance between the evolved initial conditions at time @xmath73 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the art of calculation of the lyapunov exponents ( and , in particular , the maximum lyapunov exponent ) on computers has more than a thirty - year history and during this time it has become an extensive part of applied mathematics ; see reviews in @xcite .",
    "modern numerical methods for computation of the lyapunov exponents are effective and precise .",
    "approaches for analytical estimating the lyapunov exponents were started to be developed relatively recently , beginning with those providing precision by the order of magnitude @xcite , and later on providing precision comparable to the numerical methods @xcite , though in limited applications .",
    "morbidelli and froeschl @xcite and nesvorn and morbidelli @xcite suggested to estimate the lyapunov time by taking it equal , by the order of magnitude , to the libration / circulation period of the resonant angle , or , in practice , to the period of small - amplitude oscillations on resonance ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) .",
    "this estimate has a rather limited domain of validity ; in fact , as we shall see in section  [ sec_tvne ] , @xmath75 solely at @xmath76 , and the ratio @xmath77 in both limits @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; besides , @xmath80 rather strongly depends on other parameters , such as the perturbation amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "a different approach , based on derivation of a discrete map for a triplet , was proposed by holman and murray @xcite .",
    "this is also a one - parameter approach , but using an effective resonance overlap parameter @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 or @xmath8 .",
    "the strength of perturbation is ignored , only frequencies are taken into account . in some way @xmath81 is analogous to the stochasticity parameter @xmath83 of the standard map ( whose theory is given in @xcite ) , though @xmath81 was introduced for a triplet .",
    "holman and murray derived heuristic formulas for estimating the maximum lyapunov exponent in the case of moderate resonance overlap , when @xmath84 , and in the case of strong overlap ( the adiabatic case ) , when @xmath85 . in the first case ,",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent was estimated in @xcite as @xmath86 ( the frequency of small oscillations on the resonance ) , and in the second case as @xmath87 ( the frequency of external perturbation ) .",
    "murray and holman @xcite refined somewhat the formula in the case of strong overlap ( @xmath85 ) by introducing a logarithmic dependence on @xmath81 , namely @xmath88 , the function essentially the same as for the standard map ( see subsection  [ lemsm ] ) , though derived for a triplet .",
    "for the whole range of resonance overlap , @xmath89 , they proposed the following interpolating formula :    @xmath90    let @xmath91 ( this value belongs to the case of moderate overlap ) , then , taking @xmath92 , one has @xmath93 . for the standard map , the actual value of @xmath0 at @xmath94 and @xmath92 is @xmath95 ( as we shall see in subsection  [ lemsm ] , eq .",
    "( [ lstmla1 ] ) ) , and for the triplet it is smaller .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ mh97 ] ) can be used for estimates solely by the order of magnitude , because the perturbation strength , asymmetry of perturbation , and number of resonances in multiplets are ignored in it .",
    "it can not be used in the case of weak interaction of resonances , when they do not overlap .    in @xcite ,",
    "an approach for estimating the maximum lyapunov exponent of the chaotic motion in the vicinity of separatrices of a perturbed nonlinear resonance was proposed in the framework of the separatrix map theory .",
    "we follow the approach @xcite , representing the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath0 of the motion in the main chaotic layer of system  ( [ h ] ) as the ratio of the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath96 of its separatrix map and the average period @xmath97 of rotation ( or , equivalently , the average half - period of libration ) of the resonance phase @xmath4 inside the layer . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the non - dimensional quantity @xmath98 .",
    "then the general expression for @xmath0 is    @xmath99    the quantity @xmath1 , by definition , is the lyapunov time .    in @xcite ,",
    "the following four generic kinds of interacting resonances were considered : fast - chaotic resonance triplet , fast - chaotic resonance doublet , slow - chaotic resonance triplet , and slow - chaotic resonance doublet . here",
    "we present formulas for the lyapunov time @xmath100 @xcite for these four cases , and then proceed to considering a fifth generic kind , that of infinitely many interacting resonances .",
    "assume that @xmath20 and @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "then one has a symmetric triplet of interacting resonances , and chaos is non - adiabatic .",
    "following @xcite , we take the @xmath28 dependence of the maximum lyapunov exponent of the separatrix map  ( [ sm1 ] ) in the form    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is chirikov s constant @xcite .",
    "the average increment of @xmath6 ( proportional to the average libration half - period , or rotation period ) in the chaotic layer is @xcite :    @xmath104 is the base of natural logarithms .",
    "then , the lyapunov time for the fast - chaotic resonance triplet @xcite is given by    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the period of perturbation .",
    "in the completely asymmetric case , when @xmath107 or @xmath108 , the maximum lyapunov exponent can be found by averaging the contributions of all separate components of the chaotic layer @xcite .",
    "the averaged ( over the whole layer ) value of the maximum lyapunov exponent is the sum of weighted contributions of the layer components corresponding to librations , direct rotations and reverse rotations of the model pendulum .",
    "the weights are directly proportional to the times that the trajectory spends in the components , and , due to the supposed approximate ergodicity , to the relative measures of the components in the phase space .",
    "then , the formula for the lyapunov time for the fast - chaotic resonance doublet @xcite is given by    @xmath109    where @xmath110 , and @xmath38 , @xmath96 , and @xmath111 are given by formulas  ( [ w ] ) , ( [ lsx ] ) , and ( [ tsx ] ) .      if @xmath112 , the diffusion across the chaotic layer is slow , and on a short time interval the trajectory of the separatrix map  ( [ sm1 ] ) follows close to some current `` guiding '' curve @xcite , and this allows one to estimate characteristics of the chaotic layer in a straightforward manner ; in particular , the lyapunov time for this resonance type is given by    @xmath113    where @xmath114 ( eq .  ( [ c ] ) ) .",
    "this formula has specific limits of applicability @xcite , namely , the parameter @xmath115 ( approximately equal to @xmath116 in the adiabatic case ) should not be close to @xmath117 .    at @xmath118",
    "one has @xmath119 , hence the approximate formula for the lyapunov time is    @xmath120      in this case , the separatrix algorithmic map  ( [ sam ] ) degenerates to the ordinary separatrix map  ( [ sm ] ) with @xmath121 , i.e. , mathematically this case is equivalent to the case of slow - chaotic resonance triplet , but with a different ( halved ) value of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov time is then given by    @xmath122    provided that the parameter @xmath115 is not close to @xmath123 .",
    "let us assume that the number of resonances in a resonance multiplet is greater than  3 . in applications , this number can be very large @xcite ; then , the multiplet is called a `` supermultiplet '' . if chaos is non - adiabatic ( @xmath124 ) , then one can apply , as an approximation , the formulas given in subsections  [ fcrt ] and [ fcrd ] for the triplet and doublet ( depending on the perturbation asymmetry ) cases , because the influence of the `` far away '' resonances is exponentially small with @xmath28 .",
    "however , if chaos is adiabatic ( @xmath125 ) , the triplet or doublet approximations do not work and one has to develop a different approach .",
