    "dipolar becs have recently attracted a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of a cr bec just a few years ago constitutes an important milestone  @xcite . compared to alkali atoms , cr has a comparatively large magnetic dipole moment of @xmath5 , which leads to an enhancement of the dipole - dipole interactions by a factor of 36 compared to alkali atoms .",
    "the anisotropy of the dipole - dipole interactions has been observed experimentally by analyzing time of flight expansion images of cr becs released from a cylindrically symmetric external confining potential  @xcite .",
    "if combined with theoretical calculations , the time of flight images reveal the initial density distribution of the dipolar gas and depend , e.g. , on whether the magnetic dipole moments are aligned along the axial or longitudinal confining directions , respectively .",
    "furthermore , by taking advantage of the tunability of the @xmath0-wave scattering length near a magnetic fano - feshbach resonance , the relative importance of the dipole - dipole interactions can be changed  @xcite , paving the way for a variety of interesting experimental studies .",
    "dipolar becs are characterized by intriguing collapse mechanisms  @xcite , and unique excitation spectra  @xcite and vortex structures  @xcite .",
    "in addition , dipolar gases loaded into optical lattices may allow for the realization of novel phases  @xcite .",
    "although the dipole - dipole interactions in alkali gases are too weak to result in observable effects in most experiments , it is believed that they play a decisive role in the formation of spin textures in @xmath6rb condensates  @xcite , in the dynamics of bloch oscillations of @xmath7k becs loaded into an optical lattice  @xcite and in @xmath8li becs  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , becs and degenerate fermi gases that consist of polar molecules may be realized in the near future  @xcite .",
    "this prospect adds a new intriguing twist since the interactions between two polar molecules can be tuned by an external electric field  @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to enter the strongly - correlated regime and thus to realize a variety of condensed matter analogs  @xcite .",
    "this paper considers an aligned dipolar bec in a double well geometry .",
    "double well potentials play an important role in chemical and condensed matter physics , among other areas . in the context of cold atom physics , @xmath0-wave dominated alkali systems in a double - well have , e.g. , been used to study josephson - type oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the density oscillations of the bose gas can be interpreted as corresponding to the charge current that characterizes `` standard '' condensed matter josephson junctions . related to this ,",
    "the macroscopic quantum self - trapping of atoms in one of the wells has been demonstrated experimentally and has been interpreted within a two - mode model that can be derived from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the double well system has also been used to experimentally study spin - squeezing  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the left and the right wells of the system serve as the two arms of an interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the number difference and relative phase of the double well system are conjugate variables , whose combined measurements has revealed that the system is entangled  @xcite .    here , we investigate the behaviors of aligned dipoles under cylindrically symmetric harmonic confinement with a repulsive gaussian potential centered at @xmath9 .",
    "we limit ourselves to situations where the dipoles are aligned along one of the symmetry axis of the external harmonic confining potential .",
    "this restriction reduces the parameter space and also significantly reduces the numerical efforts .",
    "arguably , it may be the conceptually simplest case .",
    "we are particularly interested in determining the phase or stability diagram for both cigar - shaped and pancake - shaped harmonic confinement .",
    "the boundaries of these phase diagrams are governed by the non - trivial interplay of the dipole - dipole interactions , the energy due to the external harmonic confinement , the energy due to the gaussian potential and the kinetic energy .",
    "the interplay of these energy contributions leads to density profiles unique to anisotropic interactions . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe josephson oscillations as well as macroscopic quantum self - trapping of the system for appropriately chosen parameters .",
    "we characterize the transition between these two regimes by analyzing the excitation spectrum and the real time response of the system to a small perturbation .",
    "our study of two neighboring pancake - shaped dipolar gases can be viewed as a first step towards understanding a multi - layer system of dipolar pancakes .",
    "for a single pancake , an angular roton instability has been predicted to occur  @xcite . for a layer of two - dimensional dipolar becs",
    ", a new length scale is given by the interlayer distance and the roton instability has been predicted to be enhanced compared to the single layer case  @xcite .",

    "more conveniently , one might envision tuning the electric dipole moment of a molecular bec through the application of an external electric field  @xcite or , in the case of magnetic cr becs , by changing the ratio between the dipole - dipole and the @xmath0-wave interactions through the application of an external magnetic field in the vicinity of a fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "although our study considers @xmath49 and varying @xmath46 , the latter scenario should allow for the observation of a number of features predicted in this study .",
