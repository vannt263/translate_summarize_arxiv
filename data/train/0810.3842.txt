    "non - perturbative investigation of the qcd dynamics in the low energy region by means of the effective lagrangian approach has made considerable progress recently . in the very low energy region ( @xmath2 ) the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) @xcite based on the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xmath4 grew into a very successful model - independent tool for description of the green functions ( gf ) of quark currents and related low - energy phenomenology .",
    "@xmath3pt is organized as a rigorously defined simultaneous perturbative expansion in small momenta and light quark masses .",
    "recent calculations are performed at the next - to - next - to - leading order @xmath5 @xcite .    in the intermediate energy region ( @xmath6 ) , however , the situation is less satisfactory .",
    "the set of relevant degrees of freedom includes now the low lying resonances and because there is no mass gap existing in the spectrum , the effective theory in this region can not be constructed as a straightforward extension of the @xmath3pt low energy expansion . on the other hand , the considerations based on the large @xmath7 expansions together with high - energy constraints derived from perturbative qcd and operator product expansion ( ope ) allow to introduce another type of effective lagrangian description , corresponding to the leading order in @xmath8 and reflecting the basic features of qcd in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "namely , the spectrum consisting of an infinite tower of free stable mesonic resonances exchanged in each channel requires infinite number of resonance fields in the @xmath10 symmetric lagrangian with interaction vertices suppressed by an appropriate power of @xmath11and ( since the @xmath12 expansion is correlated with semiclassical expansion ) only tree graphs have to be taken into account in the leading order . an approximation to this general picture consisting in limiting the number of resonance field to one in each channel and matching the resulting theory in the high energy region with ope is known as resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath3 t ) @xcite .",
    "integrating out the resonance fields from the lagrangian of r@xmath3 t in the low energy region and subsequent matching with @xmath3pt has become a very successful tool for estimates of the resonance contribution to the values of the @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite low energy constants ( lec ) entering the @xmath14pt lagrangian .",
    "though the usual chiral power counting fails within r@xmath3 t due to the presence of an additional heavy scale ( the mass of the resonances ) and the usual weinberg formula @xcite can not be generalized here ( because of the lack of a scale playing the role analogous to @xmath15 ) , it seems to be fully legitimate to go beyond the tree level r@xmath3 t and calculate the loops @xcite .",
    "being suppressed by one power of @xmath8 , the loops allow to encompass such nlo effects in the @xmath8 expansion as resonance widths and final state interaction and to determine the nlo resonance contribution to lec ( and their running with the renormalization scale ) .",
    "however , we have to be ready for both technical and conceptual complications connected with renormalization of the effective theory for which no natural organization of the expansion ( other than the @xmath8 counting ) exists .",
    "especially , because there is no natural analog of the weinberg power counting in r@xmath3 t , we can expect mixing of the naive chiral orders in the process of the renormalization ( _ e.g _ the loops renormalize the @xmath16 lec and also counterterms of unusually high chiral orders are needed ) .",
    "also , lack of appropriate protective symmetry can bring about appearance of new poles in the gf corresponding to new degrees of freedom which are frozen at the tree level .",
    "the latter might be felt as a pathological artefact of the not carefully enough formulated theory , particularly because this extra poles might be negative norm ghost or tachyons @xcite . on the other hand , however , we could also try to take advantage of this feature and adjust the poles in such a way that they correspond to the well established resonance states .    in the following",
    "we will illustrate these problems in more detail . as an explicit example we use the one - loop renormalization of the propagator corresponding to the antisymmetric tensor field which originally describes the @xmath0 vector resonance ( @xmath17 meson ) at the tree level .",
    "we will show that the loop corrections to the propagator could lead to the dynamical generation of various types of @xmath0 and @xmath18 states and that the appropriate adjustment of coupling constants allows us to generate in this way the one which could be identified with the @xmath19 meson .",
    "the details of the calculations and further discussion will be provided in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance part of the r@xmath3 t lagrangian within the antisymmetric tensor formalism reads @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 with normalized @xmath22 generators @xmath23 , @xmath24 are antisymmetric tensor fields with appropriate quantum numbers and @xmath25 is the usual chiral covariant derivative .",
    "@xmath26 is the interaction lagrangian which will be specified later .",
    "the full antisymmetric tensor field propagator @xmath27 has in general the following tensor structure @xmath28 where @xmath29 are longitudinal and transverse projectors ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 note that , for @xmath32 we can express @xmath33 as the polarization sums @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the usual spin - one polarization vectors with mass @xmath37 .",
    "the possible poles @xmath38 of @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond therefore both to the spin - one states which couple to the fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively and have therefore the same quantum numbers up to the parity .    at lo in the @xmath8 expansion",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) gives @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that the @xmath0 resonance multiplet appears as a pole in @xmath45 . because there is no pole in @xmath40 at this order , no additional @xmath46 state is propagated . beyond lo we get generally @xmath47 where the self - energies @xmath48 are of the order @xmath8 at least . in the next section we present the results of the calculation of the renormalized self - energies @xmath49 in the chiral limit at nlo for a concrete form of the interaction lagrangian @xmath26",
    "a more systematic treatment will be given in @xcite .",
    "in what follows we limit ourselves to the interaction lagrangian @xmath50 with at most two derivatives and up to two resonance fields .",
    "writing explicitly only those terms that contribute to the one - loop self - energies we have @xcite , @xcite @xmath51\\rangle + 2d_1\\langle d_\\beta u^\\sigma \\{\\widetilde{r}_{\\alpha \\sigma } , r^{\\alpha \\beta } \\}\\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath52 where @xmath53 . in the large @xmath7 limit",
    "the couplings are @xmath54 and @xmath55 and apparently the intrinsic parity odd part is of higher order .",
    "however , the trilinear vertices contributing to the one - loop self - energies are @xmath56 in both cases due to the appropriate power of @xmath57 accompanying @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the operators with two resonance fields can not be eliminated using the large @xmath7 arguments .",
    "also nonzero @xmath59 are required in order to satisfy the ope constraints for vvp gf at the lo @xcite . in order to cancel the infinite part of the one - loop self - energies we have to introduce a set of counterterms . because the interaction terms are @xmath60 we would expect ( by the analogy with @xmath3pt power counting ) these counterterms to have four derivatives at most . however , the nontrivial structure of the free resonance propagator ( namely the presence of the @xmath61 @xmath62 part ) results in the failure of this naive expectation .",
    "in fact we need counterterms with up to six derivatives , namely @xmath63 the complete list of the counterterms and their infinite parts is postponed to @xcite .",
    "let us only note that @xmath64 contains a new type of kinetic term @xmath65 .",
    "provided such a term was included in the lo lagrangian from the very beginning , the propagator would have an additional pole in @xmath66 .",
    "however , interpretation of such a pole as a @xmath1 state would be problematic .",
    "according to the sign of @xmath67 this state would be either a tachyon or a negative norm ghost @xcite .",
    "evaluating the one - loop feynman graphs and adding the polynomial contributions from the counterterms ( [ ct ] ) we get the @xmath3pt minimally subtracted self - energies @xmath68 .",
    "the equation for the poles of @xmath45 has then an approximative perturbative solution @xmath69 corresponding to the original @xmath0 vector resonance with lo mass @xmath70 , which develops a mass correction and a finite width of the order @xmath71 due to the loops and which we identify with the @xmath72 meson .",
    "this allows to re - parameterize perturbatively @xmath73 in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 and requiring further @xmath76 we get for @xmath77 @xmath78 @xcite @xmath79 \\\\ & & -\\frac{40}9\\left ( \\frac{m_\\rho } { 4\\pi f_\\pi } \\right ) ^2d_3 ^ 2(x^2 - 1)^2% \\widehat{j}(x ) \\\\ { \\sigma } _",

    "the equation for the poles of @xmath40 has only non - perturbative solutions of the order @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath1 states corresponding to them therefore decouple in the @xmath9 limit , however , for physical values of @xmath74 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( and for reasonable @xmath86 values of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath99 ) , the position of poles can lie well within the intermediate energy region we are interested in . the nature of the corresponding states , which is also controlled by the free parameters @xmath85 and @xmath99 , is rich and covers bound states @xmath100 , ( which also might be negative norm ghosts ) , tachyonic poles @xmath101 , resonance poles in the lower complex half - plane on the second sheet or even complex conjugated pair of lee - wick poles on the first sheet .",
    "it is not straightforward to formulate general conditions for @xmath102 and @xmath99 under which there is _",
    "no _ pole in @xmath103 at all , on the other hand we can rather easily arrange them to obtain the pole corresponding _",

    "we have illustrated the problems connected with loop calculations within r@xmath112 t using the one loop renormalization of the propagator of antisymmetric tensor field which describes @xmath0 resonance multiplet at the leading order of the large @xmath7 expansion as a concrete example .",
    "we have found that new @xmath1 states of various nature ( including pathological ones like negative norm ghosts and tachyons ) can be dynamically generated .",
