    "let @xmath0 be a simple graph . by @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "we denote the vertex set and the edge set of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "a vertex of degree @xmath8 in @xmath0 is called a _",
    "leaf_. a _ harmonious coloring _ of @xmath0 is a proper vertex coloring of @xmath0 such that every pair of colors appears on at most one pair of adjacent vertices .",
    "the _ harmonious chromatic number _ of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is the minimum number of colors needed for any harmonious coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "the first paper  @xcite on harmonious coloring appeared in 1982 .",
    "however , the proper definition of this notion is due to hopcroft and krishnamoorthy @xcite .",
    "harmonious coloring of a graph is essentially an edge - injective homomorphism from a graph @xmath0 to a complete graph and the harmonious chromatic number of @xmath0 is the minimum order of a complete graph that admits such homomorphism from @xmath0 .",
    "paths and cycles are among the first graphs whose harmonious chromatic numbers have been established @xcite .",
    "it was shown by hopcroft and krishnamoorthy that the problem of determining the harmonious chromatic number of a graph is np - hard .",
    "moreover , edwards and mcdiarmid  @xcite showed that the problem remains hard even restricted to the class of trees .",
    "since the problem is hard in the class of all trees , it makes sense to identify subclasses in which the problem is easier .    since vertices at distance at most two in a graph @xmath0 must have distinct colors in any harmonious coloring of @xmath0 , @xmath9 for every graph @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that if @xmath2 is a tree of order @xmath3 and @xmath10 , then @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the proof yields a polynomial - time algorithm for an optimal harmonious coloring of such a tree .",
    "we strengthen this result by finding a wider class of trees @xmath2 for which @xmath11 .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath12 if @xmath2 is a forest of order @xmath3 with @xmath13 , then @xmath14 moreover , there is a polynomial - time algorithm for an optimal harmonious coloring of such a forest .    in the next section",
    "we prove the lower bounds in the theorem and show that the bound @xmath15 is sharp . in the last two sections we prove the upper bounds in the theorem .",
    "our notation is standard . in particular , for a graph @xmath0 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes the set of vertices adjacent to @xmath19 in @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath21=\\{v\\}\\cup n_g(v)$ ] , and @xmath22 $ ] is the subgraph of @xmath0 induced by @xmath23 .",
    "since in each harmonious coloring @xmath24 of a graph @xmath0 , the colors of all neighbors of a vertex @xmath19 are different and distinct from @xmath25 , @xmath26    [ cl1 ] let @xmath27 .",
    "if a graph @xmath0 contains two non - adjacent vertices , say @xmath28 and @xmath29 , of degree @xmath30 , then @xmath31 .    *",
    "* suppose that @xmath0 has a harmonious @xmath32-coloring @xmath24 with colors in @xmath33 .",
    "then by ( [ 11 ] ) , for each @xmath34 , the set @xmath35 has a vertex in @xmath36 $ ] and a vertex in @xmath37 $ ] . if @xmath38 , then the pair @xmath39 appears on two pairs of adjacent vertices : one pair in @xmath36 $ ] and one pair in @xmath37 $ ] . and if @xmath40 , then for each @xmath41 , the pair @xmath42 appears on two pairs of adjacent vertices .",
    "so , @xmath24 is not harmonious .",
    "thus @xmath43 .",
    "now for every @xmath44 we present a tree @xmath45 such that ( i ) @xmath46 , ( ii ) @xmath13 , ( iii ) @xmath2 has no non - adjacent vertices of degree @xmath47 , and ( iv ) @xmath48 .",
    "these examples show that the restriction ( [ l0 ] ) in theorem [ l0 ] can not be weakened .",
    "let @xmath45 be obtained from a @xmath49-vertex path @xmath50 by adding @xmath51 leaves adjacent to @xmath52 , @xmath53 leaves adjacent to @xmath54 , and @xmath53 leaves adjacent to @xmath55 .",
    "tree @xmath56 is depicted in fig .",
    "1 .    .,height=113 ]    by construction , @xmath45 is a tree with maximum degree @xmath47 and @xmath57 .",
    "so , ( i ) and ( ii ) hold ; and ( iii ) is also evident .",
    "we establish ( iv ) by proving the following .",
    "[ cl2 ] @xmath58 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "suppose @xmath24 is a harmonious coloring of @xmath45 with @xmath59 colors .",
    "we may assume that @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "also we may assume that @xmath62",
    ". then @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 , no other vertices can be colored @xmath8 or @xmath65 in a harmonious @xmath66-coloring .",
    "thus , we may assume @xmath67",
    ". then @xmath68 should hold .",
    "but @xmath69 has @xmath53 vertices and only @xmath70 colors are available .",
    "therefore we can not complete the coloring with @xmath59 colors .",
    "thus @xmath71 .",
    "in this section , we present polynomial - time coloring procedures yielding that + * ( * ) * _ if ( [ l0 ] ) holds and @xmath2 is an @xmath3-vertex forest with @xmath13 such that @xmath2 has no non - adjacent vertices of degree @xmath47 , then @xmath72 . _    first , observe that the statement holds for @xmath73 : by ( [ l0 ] ) , @xmath74 .",
    "so , if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 , and so @xmath77 . if @xmath78 , then @xmath79 and hence @xmath2 is a subgraph of the @xmath49-vertex path @xmath80 whose harmonious chromatic number is @xmath81 .",
    "so , everywhere below @xmath82",
    "second , let us check that it is enough to prove ( * ) for trees . indeed , if @xmath2 is a disconnected @xmath3-vertex forest satisfying ( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ au1 ] ) with no non - adjacent vertices of degree @xmath47 , then by adding an edge connecting two leaves or isolated vertices from different components of @xmath2 , we again get a forest with these properties and fewer components .",
    "thus in this section we will assume that @xmath2 is a tree .",
    "let @xmath83 be a vertex of degree @xmath47 .",
    "we will construct a harmonious coloring @xmath84 step by step .",
    "the vertices of @xmath85 will by denoted by greek letters so that we do not mix them with the vertices of @xmath2 .",
    "we start from mapping @xmath19 and the @xmath47 neighbors of @xmath19 in @xmath2 into the all different @xmath59 vertices of @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the color of @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath87 is not defined yet , then @xmath88 is an _ uncolored vertex _ , otherwise it is a _",
    "colored vertex_.    we consider several cases .",
    "* case 0 : * @xmath2 consists of two stars with a path joining them .",
    "this case is straightforward .    * case 1 : * @xmath19 is the only vertex of degree @xmath47 in @xmath2 , and @xmath2 has no vertices of degree @xmath89 .",
    "suppose that we have already defined @xmath87 for some vertices @xmath90 ( in particular , @xmath87 is defined for @xmath91 $ ] ) . for @xmath92 , let @xmath93 also , we will say that vertices @xmath94 and @xmath95 of @xmath86 are _",
    "@xmath2-adjacent _ , if there are @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",
    "our procedure will color one vertex at each step .",
    "it works as follows :    \\(a ) choose a vertex @xmath90 such that @xmath87 is defined and @xmath88 has a neighbor @xmath99 for which @xmath24 is not defined and @xmath99 is not a leaf .",
    "if there are no such vertex , then choose @xmath99 which is a leaf .",
    "\\(b ) if there is @xmath100 such that ( i ) @xmath101 is not @xmath2-adjacent to @xmath87 and ( ii ) @xmath102 , then we let @xmath103 be any @xmath101 satisfying ( i)(ii ) and go to ( a ) of the next step .",
    "\\(c ) if no @xmath100 satisfies ( i)(ii ) , then we stop .",
    "we need to prove that we do not stop until we embed all @xmath2 .",
    "note that after the initial coloring of @xmath104 $ ] , for every @xmath105 we have @xmath106 , and hence @xmath107 .",
    "suppose that we stopped in some step , before @xmath108 was defined for every @xmath109 .",
    "this means that at the moment of stopping , either every @xmath100 is @xmath2-adjacent to @xmath87 or @xmath110 if the former holds , then since @xmath103 is not defined yet , at the moment of defining @xmath87 we had already had @xmath111 and should have stopped then .",
    "thus some @xmath100 is not @xmath2-adjacent to @xmath87 , and ( [ l1 ] ) holds .",

    "so in our case @xmath120 .",
    "thus by ( [ l1 ] ) , @xmath121    since @xmath25 is @xmath2-adjacent to every other vertex in @xmath86 , according to our rules , @xmath122 for every @xmath123 .    for every @xmath124 , @xmath125)|.\\ ] ]    we may assume that @xmath126 .",

    "so since @xmath132 is not @xmath2-adjacent to @xmath115 , the graph @xmath133 $ ] has exactly @xmath134 edges , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a neighbor of @xmath19 with @xmath138 , for @xmath139 . thus using this @xmath23 in ( [ a1 ] ) , we have @xmath140 so , @xmath141 , i.e. , @xmath142 , a contradiction . + _ case 1.2 : _ @xmath143 .",

    "so by ( [ a1 ] ) , @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 thus if @xmath160 or if ( [ a2 ] ) is a strict inequality , or if @xmath161 , then we have @xmath162 , which yields @xmath163 , a contradiction .",
    "so , by ( [ l2 ] ) we may suppose that @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and ( [ a2 ] ) holds with equality .",
    "in particular , by ( [ l2 ] ) , @xmath166 . since @xmath149 , we have @xmath167 , and so @xmath99 is not a leaf . since we do not have case 0 ,",
    "there is a leaf @xmath168 not adjacent to @xmath99 and not adjacent to @xmath19 .",
    "thus , according to our rule ( a ) , @xmath168 is not colored yet . since @xmath165 , and ( [ a2 ] )",
    "holds with equality , @xmath168 is adjacent neither to any vertex in @xmath169 nor to any vertex in @xmath170 .",
    "hence the right - hand side of ( [ a1 ] ) does not count the edge incident with @xmath168 .",
    "so , we have @xmath171 , a contradiction to @xmath172",
