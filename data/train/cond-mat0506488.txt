    "the vanishing of band gap at moderate @xmath1 for both frustrated antiferromagnets due to frustration - induced band broadening thus highlights the role of frustration in m - i transition .",
    "finally , frustration and spin fluctuations are involved in an interesting interplay with respect to stability of the insulating state .",
    "frustration generally enhances spin fluctuations and magnetic disordering .",
    "it will therefore be interesting to also examine the interband self - energy contribution which reduces magnetic order due to interband spectral weight transfer , and also widens the band gap and thereby stabilizes the insulating state .",

    "<S> hole and electron spectral features are evaluated at intermediate @xmath1 , and analyzed in terms of a competition between the frustration - induced direct hopping and the virtual hopping . </S>",
    "<S> finite @xmath1-induced competing interactions and frustration effects contributing through the magnon dispersion are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finite contribution to self - energy correction from long - wavelength ( goldstone ) modes , together with the high density of electron scattering states in the narrow , sharp peak in the upper band , result in strong fermion - magnon scattering leading to pronounced incoherent behaviour in the electron dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation - induced first - order metal - insulator transition due to vanishing band gap is also discussed . </S>"
