    "recently a lot of effort has been paid to describe the behavior of paired small systems , such as metallic clusters and nuclei . the starting point in all these methods",
    "is pairing hamiltonian of the system under study .",
    "various methods are used to calculate the partition(or grand partition ) function and they are different in how the constraint of fixed number of particles is considered in the calculations . some of the methods such as the static - path approximation(spa ) plus random - phase approximation(rpa ) @xcite use number projected partition function .",
    "some others as lipkin - nogami method @xcite add non - extensive terms to the free energy to fix the particle number .",
    "in the bcs method @xcite grand partition function is used to obtain thermodynamic functions of the system . the bcs uses the most probable value of pairing gap parameter which for few particle systems like nucleus leads to prediction of some unreal singularities in heat capacity that is due to of ignoring the impact of fluctuations in such systems .",
    "experiments conducted by oslo group @xcite show a very smooth variation of heat capacity versus temperature , with a peak which is believed to be due to a phase transition in nuclei . to tackle the problem of singularities in bcs we must take into account the effect of fluctuations .",
    "so we have used the isothermal probability distribution @xcite , which states the probability of a system to be in a specific configuration is proportional to the exponential of it s free energy . using this principal we calculate the mean value of gap parameter and then the thermodynamic properties of nuclei based on of the mean value of pairing gap parameter instead of the most probable value .",
    "the bcs is the standard theory to deal with a system of fermions having pairing potential .",
    "the main tool which is used to obtain thermodynamic properties in this method is the grand potential of the system , @xmath1 , which has the following form in the mean field approximation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is single particle energy of particles,@xmath4 is quasi particle energy , @xmath5 is the pairing strength , @xmath6 is the chemical potential and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the temperature . in this equation @xmath9 is the gap parameter which is a measure of the pairing correlation .",
    "thermodynamic quantities of the system , such as the number of particles @xmath10 , the energy of the system @xmath11 and the entropy @xmath12 are calculated from following relations . @xmath13 the standard procedure to calculate gap parameter is minimizing the free energy @xmath14 which leads to the bcs gap equation @xmath15",

    "the maximum value of @xmath22 is consistent with that of the most probable values .",

    "we have extracted the following values of pairing gap at zero temperature , @xmath40 for protons and neutrons , using the three point method @xcite @xmath42 the results are also shown in fig.([f2 ] ) .",
    "the effect of different values of @xmath40 on heat capacity will be discussed .",
    "the gradual decreasing of gap parameter with a sudden decrease is seen which can be comparable with the experimental values @xcite . the results obtained by k. kaneko et.al,@xcite , are also shown for comparison .",
    "this is interpreted as a rapid breaking of nucleon cooper pairs and the suppression of pairing correlation .",
    "also this is correlated with the s shape of the heat capacity .",

    "the results are plotted in fig.([f4 ] ) , for @xmath0 nucleus , for the two sets of @xmath40 , where @xmath44 . also in fig.([f5 ] ) the experimental @xcite and the rpa+spa heat capacities @xcite are plotted for comparison .",
    "the extracted results show the discontinuities have been disappeared and the heat capacity exhibits an s shape , very similar in shape with the experiments above @xmath45 . below @xmath46 , the results of spa , the npspa and this work are in coincidence .    in summery , taking into account thermal fluctuation , the discontinuity of the heat capacity is washed out and a continues s - shape around the critical temperature has been obtained as it is found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the s shape of the heat capacity is well correlated in temperature with the suppression of @xmath47 and @xmath48 as is shown in fig.([f2 ] ) .",
    "this is interpreted as a signature of the thermal pairing phase transition .",
