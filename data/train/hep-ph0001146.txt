    "recently charge symmetry violation ( csv ) in the parton distributions of the nucleon has attracted great interest .",
    "it has been generally believed that charge symmetry ( cs ) was highly respected in the nucleon system .",
    "most low energy experiments have shown that cs is satisfied within about @xmath0 in reaction amplitudes @xcite , and most high energy tests are also consistent with the charge symmetry , although generally with less precision than the low energy tests ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however some theoretical calculations have suggested that the csv in the valence quark distributions may be as large as @xmath2 @xcite which is rather large compared with the low - energy results .",
    "there have been proposed a number of experiments in which csv may be observed @xcite .",
    "a serious challenge to cs has come from the comparison of the @xmath3 structure functions measured in charged and uncharged lepton deep inelastic scattering @xcite performed by boros , londergan and thomas @xcite . a significantly larger csv than the expectations of both theory @xcite and other experiments @xcite was found for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions in the low-@xmath6 region ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "any unexpected large csv will greatly affect our understanding of non - perturbative dynamics and hadronic structure @xcite , and also the extraction of @xmath8 from neutrino scattering @xcite .",
    "more recently , boros , steffens , londergan and thomas @xcite performed a similar analysis to ref .",
    "@xcite with improved corrections for nuclear shadowing and the charm threshold in the neutrino data .",
    "they found that the data ( including the low-@xmath6 region where a large discrepancy was found in @xcite ) are consistent with charge symmetry within experimental errors and the present uncertainty in the strange quark distribution of the nucleon .",
    "thus suggestions of any large csv in the parton distributions of the nucleon result from theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "most of these theoretical calculations are performed using a quark model , such as the mit bag model @xcite , los alamos potential model @xcite , or a model independent version @xcite .",
    "the quark model calculations are based on a quark - spectator ( quark - diquark ) picture of the nucleon in deep inelastic reactions , which is questionable in the low-@xmath6 region .",
    "hence the quark model predictions for the low-@xmath6 behaviour of csv are not very reliable . for the sea quark content ,",
    "quark model calculations involve spectator states containing four quarks , which is also unreliable in the low-@xmath6 region as the mass parameter for these four - quark ( or three - quark one - antiquark ) states is less well - determined than that for the diquark states .",
    "csv has also been estimated using the light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model @xcite . however , this calculation is mostly qualitative  the quantitative calculations are highly dependant on the model parameters .",
    "more theoretical study on csv from a different point of view than the quark model will be worthwhile .    in this paper , we point out that the csv in both the valence quark and sea quark has the same non - perturbative source , and that the meson cloud model ( mcm )  which has been successfully applied to the study of the sea quark content of nucleon ( including su(2 ) flavour asymmetry @xcite , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 content of the nucleon @xcite )  can provide a natural explanation of csv in the valence quark and sea quark distributions of the nucleon .",

    "the second order term is of opposite sign to the first order term , which indicates that the first order estimate of the shift in the quark distribution is too large in this region .",
    "this in turn implies that the estimate of csv induced shifts in the quark distributions in this region are also too large .",
    "these conclusions are not much influenced by the choice of valence quark parametrization , the value chosen for @xmath133 , or whether we use benesh and londergan s expression for the dependence of the quark distribution on @xmath116 rather than equation ( [ eq : deltaq ] ) .",
    "the reason for these conclusions not being greatly influenced by the choice of expression for @xmath137 is that , with the quark distributions used , the highest order derivative term in @xmath6 always dominates .",
    "this is a consequence of the divergences in the valence quark distributions near @xmath138 , @xmath139 in all cases .",
    "although it has been generally assumed that charge symmetry was highly respected in the nucleon system , there have been some phenomenological analysis @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite about the possible extent of csv in the parton distributions .",
    "any unexpected large csv will greatly affect our understanding on the non - perturbative dynamics and hadronic structure , and the extraction of @xmath8 from neutrino scattering .",
    "up to now most theoretical attempts to calculate the csv in the parton distributions are based on the quark model and employ the quark - diquark model . in this paper",
    "we point out that csv in both the valence and sea quark distributions of the nucleon can arise from the non - perturbative dynamics of the nucleon .",
    "we present an alternative analysis of csv in the parton distributions employing the meson cloud model , which has previously been successful in the study of the flavour asymmetry and the quark - antiquark asymmetry of the nucleon . in the meson cloud model",
    "the proton and neutron may fluctuate into hadron - meson fock states in which the hadrons and mesons are in different charged states respectively .",
    "as we consider the mass differences among these hadrons and mesons , the probabilities of proton and neutron fluctuating into the corresponding fock states will be different .",
    "thus the non - perturbative contributions to the valence and sea quarks distributions will be different , which naturally leads to the csv in both the valence and sea distributions of the nucleon .",
    "our predictions for the csv in the valence sector and sea sector are both different from the quark model calculations .",
    "we also point out the deficiencies of quark model based calculations of csv in the parton distributions .",
    "in particular the quark - diquark picture is inadequate at low-@xmath6 , and in the medium-@xmath6 region the use of a first order shift in the parton distributions must be questioned , as higher order shifts are of similar magnitude .",
    "the coming experimental information on the parton distributions of the nucleon and more theoretical studies on this issue will examine these calculations .",
