    "discrete quantum random walks on a line , @xcite,@xcite , aa,@xcite , ( for a review in a more general setting see kempe ) is a paradigmatic construction of a quantum system performing a motion similar to the usual classical discrete random walk on a line , but with a number of important differences like the quantum treatment of its coin and walker systems , the role of quantum entanglement , novel diffusion and hitting properties of its motion etc .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of such walks has been studied in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "also important theoretical suggestions about the utilization of those properties in the construction of quantum algorithms that would outperform classical rivals in tasks such as searching a database etc , have been put forward , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the effect of decoherence on the evolution of discrete quantum walks has been studied in e.g. @xcite,@xcite .",
    "experimental proposals also exists concerning e.g. quantum coin - tossing , and quantum diffusion see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the coin control over discrete quantum walks on graphs has been studied in @xcite .",
    "continuous time quantum walks on graphs , which are defined without the use of a coin , were studied in e.g. @xcite,@xcite , and their potential implementation for the construction of fast search algorithms were studied in @xcite .",
    "the present work extends previous ones on the so called @xmath0 models of quantum discrete walks on a line@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "its aim is twofold : first to argue that a general and systematic framework of quantization of classical walks is possible and well physically motivated , and second to study the walk beyond transient dynamics in its asymptotic regime and to show the possibility of simulating its statistical behavior in terms of another quantum system , introducing thus the quantum simulation of a quantum walk .",
    "this double aim is achieved by introducing the quantum optical random walk ( qorw ) ; a mathematical model that refers to a typical cavity qed type of arrangement where a beam of two - level atoms passes through an optical cavity .",
    "[ technical caveat : although the mathematical description of cavity field done here is not the usual one i.e. in terms of the boson degree of freedom , but instead is in terms of states with positive and negative valued energy also ( canonical algebra vs. euclidean algebra , see below ) , appropriate truncations can be introduced in order to have only positive energy states * * ( * * c.f .",
    "e.g. @xcite * * ) * * ; this remedy for the problem however will not be discussed here . ]",
    "the outline of the paper goes as follows : in chapter ii , the study of quantization rules is developed , the qorw is introduce in chapter iii and several example of walks are solved ; chapter iv treats the walk in its asymptotic regime and introduces the technique of quantum simulation , examples of numerically simulated asymptotic probability density functions are provided ; conclusions are summarized in last chapter v.",
    "the essential feature of a simple qrw on a line is the promotion of mathematical correspondence : _ _ left / right__@xmath1_head / tails , _ between _ walker _ s move directions and _ coin _ s two sides , to a dynamical interaction among two physical systems .",
    "this is realized by introducing state hilbert spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 for quantum walker and coin systems respectively . in @xmath4 operates the euclidean algebra with generators the _ step operators _",
    "@xmath5(and their their powers e.g. for @xmath6 @xmath7 and the _ position operator _",
    "@xmath8 they satisfy the commutation relations @xmath9=\\pm e_{\\pm } , $ ] @xmath10=0.$ ] also important is the fourier basis @xmath11 which is the eigenbasis of step operators viz .",
    "@xmath12 in the coin space the projection operators @xmath13 are needed in order to realize the coin - tossing that drives the walk .",
    "indeed one step of classical random walk ( crw ) , is described by means of the unitary @xmath14 its conditional action on walker states realizes the coin - tossing and the subsequent move of walker .    explicitly the coin @xmath15  and walker @xmath16  density matrices initially taken in product form @xmath17 are assumed to interact unitarily by the transformation @xmath18subsequently the two systems are decoupled by an unconditional measurement of the coin subsystem realized by means of the partial trace i.e. @xmath19  ; the latter constitues the dynamical realization of the coin tossing process .",
    "the resulting walker density matrix @xmath20written in the eigenbasis states of position operator @xmath21  ( see above ) , provides by means of its diagonal elements the occupation probability distribution @xmath22of the states of walker system .",
    "this distribution in the course of time steps of the walk @xmath23 , is identified with the occupation probabilities of the classical random walk on integers i.e. @xmath24with bias determined by the elements of @xmath15 . due to this",
    "the @xmath25  map is conceived as realization of crw , which we next seek to quantize .",
    "quantization of crw is conceived as the incorporation in coin space of an additional unitary operator @xmath26 the coin reshuffling matrix , so that the one - step operator now becomes @xmath27 to facilitate conceptual comparisons this procedure was christened @xmath28quantization in ref .",
    "almost all work that has been done in the area of quantum random walks , has been based on the scheme of @xmath28quantization or modifications thereof .",
    "one particular class of such @xmath28quantized walks are the @xmath29models for which the one - step evolution of the walker s density matrix is given by the cptp map @xmath30 as @xmath31@xcite .",
    "next we introduce a generalized version of the previous quantization method , the @xmath32quantization rule , which employs a positive and completely positive trace preserving map @xmath33 acting on the coin density matrices , which is not necessarily taken to be unital , namely @xmath34 then the one - step evolution of walker s density matrix of an @xmath32quantized model of a classical walk is defined as @xmath35 in general for a @xmath0 quantum walk model we will have that @xmath36 , \\]]where in general a different quantizing cp map @xmath37 can be used between coin+walker interactions . to appreciate the changes brought about by @xmath32quantization we use the adjoint action of e.g operator @xmath38 on a density matrix defined as @xmath39with property @xmath40",
    "we assume that the @xmath37 map is determined by a set of kraus operators as @xmath41 or in terms of the adjoint action @xmath42nielsenchuang . to contrast deference between the usual @xmath28quantization and the proposed @xmath32quantization rules we write the evolution map of the former",
    "as @xmath43and the evolution map of the latter as @xmath44    it is evident from above that the @xmath32quantization rule applies a sum of adjoints at each factor of the @xmath45fold product .",
    "this sum in addition to @xmath46 is determined by the kraus generators of the quantization map @xmath47 in the simplest case where there is only one single unitary kraus generator , the @xmath32 rule reduces to the @xmath28quantization rule .",
    "the inclusion of kraus generators in the quantization of  classical walk , may stem from the fact of a hidden quantum interaction between the coin system and another unobserved quantum system , or it may be due to some classically fluctuating parametric variance of the coin system , that is treated on the average ; generically we may say that it is due to quantum or classical noise .",
    "( see also previous studies of non - unitary models travaglione , sanders , dur , lp , ks , rom , the number of kraus generators as well as their matrix type provide in any case a flexible framework in which the quantization map may incorporate complex physical processes in coin systems that may take place within a evolution step of the walk .",
    "as an application of the @xmath32quantization rule we introduce a new kind of quantum walk . to this end we need to introduce a continuous family cptp maps @xmath48 acting on the space of coin density matrices , where variable @xmath49 is taken to stand for time . among members of family @xmath50",
    "there exists a semi - group composition law , i.e @xmath51also the identity map @xmath52 is included in @xmath53    now we come to the quantum optical random walk ; it physically outlines the crossing of an beam of two - level atoms , the _ coins , _ through a quantum optical cavity which sustains a standing quantum mode identified with the _ walker _ system .",
    "the walker+coin interaction realizes a @xmath54 qrw model , and it also takes into account the interaction of coin with some external environment , formalized as some cptp time dependent map @xmath55 .",
    "this external interaction of the coin is taken to have been initiated at some past time @xmath56 and to continuously happen in time while atom crosses the cavity .",
    "entering into the cavity at some time @xmath57 in state @xmath58 , the atom interacts instantaneously , being the coin part of qrw , with the walker / cavity mode . for the @xmath59 model two such coin+walker interactions occur : one interaction at time @xmath57 that changes their combine state as @xmath60 and a second one later on at time @xmath61 that effects the change of state : @xmath62 @xmath63 the @xmath64 s are realized by sudden on - off switches of the mode+atom interaction , possibly by driving the cavity mode off resonance .",
    "then the two interactions taken together constitute one step of the walk .",
    "subsequently the atom is considered leaving the cavity , the time clock is been reset , and a new atom is entering the cavity.(a realistic cavity qed model for implementing qrw in atom+mode interactions has been proposed in @xcite . ) explicitly the total change of walker s density matrix between two successive steps is given by the equation @xmath65 , \\]]for @xmath66or more explicitly @xmath67this shows that the @xmath32quantized @xmath59 walk proceeds with steps of length @xmath68 and @xmath69on the ladder of walker states , with weights determined by the time dependent cptp @xmath70this same map actually serves as the source of quantization of classical @xmath71 walk .",
    "it is important however to emphasize that in this walk the physical origin of quantization is not an ad hoc imposed unitary rotation matrix in coin space , as it has been in most cases following the @xmath28quantization rule , but instead it is the physical process of natural interaction of coin system with some external agent . as an example we can consider the case of a rabi oscillating two - level atom that decays spontaneously .",
    "such physical conditions render the @xmath32generalization of quantization for a classical walk a well motivated one .",
    "the one - step map @xmath72 previously introduced is determined by parameters ; these are some e.g @xmath73 parameter measuring the strength of @xmath74 , and the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath75 determining the time intervals of coin+walker interactions .",
    "those time parameters should be finely tuned , so that is possible for the two interactions to take place during the time the atom / coin spends in the cavity .",
    "this can be decided by selecting the velocity of the atomic beam crossing the cavity .    to proceed with the problem of time evolution",
    "we introduce walker s density matrix , @xmath76 due to linearity of evolution we only need to compute@xmath77 then @xmath78 in formulas above matrix @xmath79 is defined in the eigenbasis of step operators as @xmath80diag@xmath81 namely in @xmath82-basis we have that @xmath83 where @xmath84-th site occupation probability on the walker s ladder after @xmath85 steps is @xmath86change to variables @xmath87 in the preceding expression shows that _ if _ @xmath88 _ _  is independent from variable _ _",
    "@xmath89 then the @xmath90 integral can be carried out and the probability becomes @xmath91then the @xmath92 can be identified with the characteristic function of the transition probability function of a classical random walkhughes .",
    "this is a general result independent of quantization rule that can be used as a _ criterion of classicality _ of quantum walk .",
    "let us give some examples of classical walks quantized according to @xmath93 and @xmath94 rules , and impose on them the criterion of classicality .",

    "so the diagonal elements of evolved walker s density matrix can be identified with a classical distribution .",
    "_ statement _ : direct calculation verifies the general statement that classicality prevails in any @xmath32quantized @xmath0 model , independently from the initial condition of coin system , as long as the quantization proceeds by employing an @xmath37 quantization map with kraus generators being matrices having only diagonal or only anti - diagonal elements ; such examples of @xmath37 maps are e.g the @xmath115 the depolarization channels , the mentioned spontaneous emission channel , as well as the transformation induced on the coin / atom after tracing out the bosonic field freedom in jaynes - cummings model and in its various modifications ( c.f .",

    "_ ) and _ iv _ ) we see that we pass from the @xmath28quantization rule of the former to the @xmath32 quantization rule of the latter by simply mixing the reshuffling unitary matrix @xmath124 with the unit matrix .",
    "such mixing is relevant in cases where there is probabilistic uncertainty as to whether reshuffling matrix is applied or not .",
