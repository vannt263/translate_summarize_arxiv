    "in condensed matter physics the interplay among strain , strong correlation , and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has been becoming extremely important.@xcite this leads to abundant unconventional phenomena such as magnetic ordering , interface superconductivity , metal - insulator transitions , and more recently topological insulators.@xcite in a mott transition , in particular , the ratio @xmath8 of correlation strength @xmath9 to bandwidth @xmath10 determines charge- , spin- , and orbital - orderings .",
    "@xmath10 can be controlled by external factors such as doping , pressure , and strain by a proper choice of substrate .",
    "the strain has been of great interest for applications of band engineering.@xcite recently , another type of the mott insulator induced by correlation effects which are assisted by spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , named relativistic mott insulator , has been observed in cubic double perovskite ba@xmath11naoso@xmath12 and a few ir - based oxides , which show substantially strong soc.@xcite the relativistic mott transition was also proposed to occur even in the @xmath13 li@xmath11rho@xmath0 system.@xcite in this transition , soc leads to the removal of degeneracy in partially filled bands or narrowing of the bandwidth , and then strong correlation selects a filled orbital .",
    "however , pure correlation effects often lead to a metal - insulator transition in @xmath7 systems , where the strength of soc is negligible compared to that of correlation . here",
    ", we will address a strain and soc - driven mott transition , accompanied by orbital - ordering ( oo ) , in the @xmath1 bacro@xmath0 thin film synthesized recently.@xcite in this system , strength of soc is indeed tiny , but crucial to open a gap .",
    "this has been rarely observed in @xmath7 systems .",
    "tetravalent @xmath14 chromate perovskites have recently drawn attention due to their atypical and controversial properties.@xcite although the orthorhombic antiferromagnet cacro@xmath0 is metallic , it was suggested that correlation effects play an important role.@xcite another metallic antiferromagnet srcro@xmath0 has a tetragonally distorted structure due to partial oo of @xmath15.@xcite through correlated first principles calculations , gupta _ et al .",
    "_ proposed that lattice distortions in an ultrathin srcro@xmath0 film lead to oo , which in turn induces ferroelectricity.@xcite recently , zhu _ et al .",
    "_ synthesized the missing member , bacro@xmath0 , of the tetravalent chromate perovskites , on srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surfaces.@xcite as observed in the isostructural srcro@xmath0,@xcite the distortion factor of @xmath16 is as small as approximately 0.5 % , and this prevents the cro@xmath12 octahedron from rotating and tilting ( see below ) .",
    "the magnetic measurements show hysteresis with a small coercive field and small saturated moment of 0.028 @xmath17 with curie temperature @xmath18 k , indicating a weak ferromagnet ( fm ) or canted antiferromagnet ( afm ) .",
    "the resistivity data follow an insulating behavior with a kink at @xmath19 k and indicate an activation energy gap of @xmath20 0.38 ev .",
    "they also performed correlated first principles calculations using the local spin density approximation plus hubbard @xmath9 ( lsda+u ) approach , but failed to obtain the observed insulating state.@xcite motivated by the failure of lsda+u , giovannetti _ et al .",
    "_ carried out dynamical mean field calculations and concluded that a jahn - teller distortion in the plane of the tetragonal cell with two different cr - o bond lengths would lead to an insulating state.@xcite    the nature of the insulating state of bacro@xmath0   can be unveiled from first principles calculations , including @xmath9 and ( relativistic ) soc effects , using an accurate all - electron full - potential electronic method of wien2k.@xcite considering only @xmath9 and soc simultaneously throughout the lsda+soc+u approach , we obtained the experimentally observed insulating state,@xcite indicating a crucial role of soc . in contrast to the jahn - teller distortion incorporated scenario,@xcite our results show that this insulating state is induced by the small structure distortion and soc activated by narrowing @xmath10 , resulting from the enlarged volume due to the strain of the substrate .",
    "the accompanying oo stabilizes the c - type afm ( c - afm ) , which is antiparallel in - plane and parallel along the @xmath21-axis , and leads to an unusually large orbital moment @xmath6 equal to half of the spin moment @xmath22 in this system .",
    "interestingly , as shown below , this feature also drives a considerable @xmath6 in the apical oxygens .",
    "according to the experiment by zhu _",
    ", the tetragonal perovskite phase appears to be unstable in the bulk.@xcite we optimized the crystal structure to investigate stability of the tetragonal structure . during the optimization in the tetragonal phase ,",
    "the ratio @xmath16 was fixed at the value obtained in the experiment.@xcite the structural parameters were optimized until forces were smaller than 2 mry / a.u . as shown in fig .",
    "[ str](a ) , our optimized volume is about 18% less than that of the experiment . considering that the l(s)da usually underestimates an experiment volume by at most several percents , as observed for the similar compound srcro@xmath0,@xcite this difference is significant",
    "this implies that the srtio@xmath0 substrate significantly expands the volume of bacro@xmath0 , consistent with the instability of the bulk state.@xcite remarkably , near the optimized volume the cubic and tetragonal phases are nearly degenerate .",
    "we will return to this issue below . when @xmath21-axis lattice parameter in perovskites decreases , the in - plane lattice parameter tends to increase to prevent the volume from varying.@xcite this leads to the distortion from the cubic to the tetragonal structures .",
    "for the experiment volume , the tetragonal phase has an energy 57 mev lower than the cubic phase , consistent with the experiment .",
    "we also investigated a possible tilting and rotating of the cro@xmath12 octahedron .",
    "however , our trials to obtain this gadolinium orthoferrite gdfeo@xmath0-type structure always converged to the tetragonal phase observed in the experiment,@xcite indicating that the gdfeo@xmath0-type distortion is not energetically favored in this system . from hereon ,",
    "unless stated otherwise , we use the experiment lattice parameters @xmath23    and @xmath24 .@xcite    in wien2k , the basis size was determined by r@xmath25k@xmath26=7 and augmented - plane - wave sphere radii ( 2.5 for ba , 2.01 for cr , and 1.82 for o ) .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled with up to a dense @xmath27-mesh of @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , linear response full - phonon calculations were performed with quantum espresso.@xcite these calculations were carried out with a 2@xmath292@xmath292 @xmath30-mesh , a 14@xmath2914@xmath2914 @xmath27-mesh , an energy cutoff of 40 ry , and a charge cutoff of 400 ry .    .",
    "individual spin @xmath22 , orbital @xmath6 , and net @xmath31 moments of the c - afm ( in units of @xmath17 ) , obtained from lsda+soc and lsda+soc+u at @xmath32 ev calculations .",

    "the results of the generalized gradient approximation plus hubbard @xmath9 ( gga+u ) , performed by giovannetti _",
    "et al._,@xcite show that the in - plane jahn - teller distortion is stable .",
    "this is consistent with our lsda+u calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ str](b ) .",
    "however , the addition of soc to the lsda+u approach relieves the jahn - teller distortion in both metallic and insulating states .",
    "this rules out the scenario of mott transition driven by the jahn - teller distortion in this system , which was proposed by giovannetti _",
    "et al_.    in the cro@xmath12 octahedron , the tetragonal distortion , shortening of @xmath21 lattice parameter , lowers the center of @xmath33 and results in the splitting of the @xmath34 manifold into the singlet @xmath33 and doublet @xmath35 .",
    "thus , for this @xmath14 configuration , the doublet is half - filled in a spin ordered state .",
    "initially , we applied the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath9 to the cr ions to obtain the observed insulating state , using the lsda+u approach , in which the effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath36 was used where @xmath37 is the hund s exchange integral .",
    "as observed in the previous calculation,@xcite inclusion of only @xmath38 can not produce an insulating state even for large values such as @xmath39 ev , which is already beyond a reasonable value for this system .",
    "therefore , we add to the lsda+u approach the effects of soc in the magnetization direction along the @xmath21-axis , which is the high symmetry direction in the crystal structure . in the @xmath34 manifold , soc transforms \\{@xmath33 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 } into \\{@xmath33 , @xmath42}.@xcite in the lsda+soc+u calculations , an energy gap appears at the critical value @xmath43 ev,@xcite and finally reaches to the experimentally observed gap of @xmath44 ev at @xmath32 ev .",
    "figure [ str](c ) shows the change in the energy gap as a function of @xmath38 in the c - afm .",
    "the @xmath45 is somewhat larger than the value obtained from the constrained random - phase approximation,@xcite since @xmath9 acts on the mixture of cr @xmath7 and o @xmath46 due to the strong @xmath47 hybridization , which can be measured in the dos of fig .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is a regime around @xmath45 in which both metallic and insulating solutions are obtained , as is extensively discussed in literature.@xcite however , for this system an insulating state is always energetically favored over a metallic state at the same @xmath38 in this regime .    to disclose the nature of the insulating state",
    ", we analyze the electronic and magnetic structures in detail .",
    "figure [ str](c ) shows that the c - afm is energetically favored over fm , which has a much lower energy than the nonmagnetic state ( by 216 mev / f.u . in lsda+soc ) , regardless of the strength of @xmath38 . as @xmath38 increases",
    ", the difference in energy ( @xmath48 ) per formula unit between these two states monotonically decreases with a slope of @xmath49 . using a simple heisenberg model @xmath50 , for this spin @xmath51 configuration the superexchange parameter @xmath37 is estimated by @xmath52 mev at @xmath32 ev .",
    "the c - afm alignment has been observed in both cacro@xmath0 and srcro@xmath0.@xcite now , we focus on the c - afm alignment in both the metallic and insulating phases , where the latter is obtained from the lsda+soc+u calculations at @xmath32 ev . the total and atom - projected doss for both the metallic and insulating phases are displayed in fig .",
    "the corresponding band structures with the emphasized fatbands of the @xmath33 and the @xmath53 orbitals are given in fig .",
    "in fact , the electronic structures of lsda+soc are nearly identical to those of lsda ( not shown here ) , since the strength of soc is only several mev near the fermi energy . in the metallic state",
    ", the partially filled @xmath34 manifold is separated from the unfilled @xmath54 manifold in most regimes , but the @xmath33 band touches the bottom of the conduction band with a @xmath55 character at the @xmath56 point .",
    "as shown in the dos , @xmath10 of the @xmath57-filled @xmath34 manifold consistent with the @xmath14 configuration , is about 1.3 ev .",
    "this leads to an estimated value of the nearest neighbor hopping parameter @xmath58 ev .",
    "this value is a half of that for the nonmagnetic state , indicating a considerable narrowing due to the afm alignment .",
    "our calculated moments are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the spin moment @xmath22 for cr is 1.68 @xmath17 , substantially lower than the formal value of 2 @xmath17 due to the strong @xmath47 hybridization .",
    "these features can be visualized in a spin - density isocountour plot , as displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ spin ] . in the metallic phase ,",
    "the minority of cr atoms has a @xmath59 character , while the majority of cr indicates an equally occupied @xmath34 manifold .",
    "this clear visibility of the minority density indicates a strong @xmath60 hybridization .    in the insulating state ,",
    "the upper hubbard band is at the bottom of the conduction band , while the occupied @xmath33 and the lower hubbard band are mostly around 4 ev , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the corresponding spin - density plot is displayed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "the cr majority character represents a mixture of @xmath61 . as given in table [ table1 ] , the cr orbital moment @xmath62 @xmath17 is antialigned to the corresponding @xmath22 , leading to the net moment @xmath63 @xmath17 .",
    "this antialignment indicates that the lower hubbard band has mostly the @xmath64 character for the spin - up cr , but the @xmath65 character for the spin - down cr .",
    "this zigzag oo in the @xmath66-plane is consistent with the c - afm alignment .",
    "a similar oo was observed in the spinel znv@xmath11o@xmath67 , as including both @xmath9 and soc.@xcite although some @xmath7 systems show an unquenched @xmath6,@xcite this substantially large @xmath6 is rare in @xmath7 systems .",
    "interestingly , the spin density of the apical oxygens clearly indicates the @xmath68 character , even though the @xmath22 of the apical oxygens is only 0.095 @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath22 of the apical oxygen is nearly compensated by the considerable @xmath69 @xmath17 , which is unprecedented for an oxygen ion.@xcite however , recently this unusual feature has been observed in a @xmath70 system.@xcite",
    "we also performed lsda+soc+u calculations for our optimized volume .",
    "as expected from widening @xmath10 of the @xmath34 manifold by @xmath71% due to compression of the volume , in the optimized structure a gap appears at @xmath72 ev , about 50 % larger than in the experiment structure .",
    "thus , if the optimized volume can be attained experimentally , this system would be metallic .",
    "these results suggest that change in strain ( or applying a pressure ) leads to an insulator - metal transition in this system .",
    "to investigate the stability of these structures , we carried out linear response full - phonon calculations for both the experiment volume and our optimized volume .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ phonon ] . in good agreement with the instability in the bulk,@xcite",
    "there are several imaginary frequencies in the experiment volume .",
    "however , our results show that in the optimized volume both the tetragonal and cubic perovskites are stable .",
    "this suggests that these phases would be achieved by a proper choice of substrate or a high pressure technique , requiring further experiments .",
    "considering the tiny difference in energy ( @xmath731 mev ) between the cubic and the tetragonal phases , our results imply that the cubic structure would be stabilized by quantum fluctuations.@xcite    in summary , we have carried out _ ab initio _ calculations including both correlation and soc effects to investigate a tetragonally distorted perovskite bacro@xmath0 , whose the volume seems to be considerably enhanced by the strain of the srtio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "inclusion of both soc and @xmath9 causes this @xmath14 system to change to insulating at @xmath74 ev , though the metallic state remains unchanged on applying @xmath9 only .",
    "this indicates a crucial role of soc in this mott insulator , which is uncommon in @xmath7 systems . in the insulating state",
    ", one electron occupies @xmath33 and the other alternatively occupies @xmath2 or @xmath3 orbital , resulting in an unquenched cr orbital moment @xmath6 which is antialigned to the cr spin moment @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the ground state of c - afm , implying that the observed small moment is due to a little canted spin .",
    "remarkably , due to the spin and orbital orderings of the cr ions the spin density of the apical oxygen ions clearly shows the admixture of @xmath68 characters , leading to the considerable spin and orbital moments antialigned each other .",
