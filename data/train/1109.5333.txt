    "the two - party correlations in a many - body quantum state are measured by correlation functions associated with physical observables in traditional physics , while they are measured by the mutual entropy in quantum information .",
    "the two - party correlations can be further classified into quantum two - party correlations and classical two - party correlations , and entanglement is a specific type of quantum correlations , which is extensively investigated in quantum information science .",
    "the measures of different types of corrrelations are proposed in literature .",
    "the widely used entanglement measure is the entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite , and quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite is used to characterize the quantum correlations .",
    "recently , many investigations have been made in understanding the dynamical creation and evolution of correlations between the nearest - neighbor particle pairs and between two distant particles which are not connected by direct interactions in the spin chain model , for example , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and ising model systems @xcite . as we know , if two particles directly interact with each other , then the correlations between these two particles can be built dynamically from an initial state without correlations . however ,",

    "the correlations outside the light cone defined by the lieb - robinson velocity can be neglected .",
    "recently , the lieb - robinson theorem has received renewed interest and has been applied to the condensed matter theory and quantum information theory @xcite .",

    "we consider the measures of different types of correlations , including correlation functions , mutual entropy , eof , and qd . thus we can investigate whether the generalized lieb - robinson velocity depends on the correlation measures . the criterion for correlation appearance is to set the correlation measure to a value numerically so small such that the correlation appearance time is almost fixed .    in our article",

    "in other words , the longer the distance between the first spin and the last spin is , the more time the appearance of their correlation needs .      in quantum information science , the characterization of correlations in a bipartite quantum state is relatively well understood .",

    "[ fig:8 ] , we plot four cases in each figure , that is , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , in order to find the relation between the dynamical evolution and the length of spin chain . from these three figures , we observe that the dynamical evolutions of mi , qd and eof are similar with cfs , that is , the creation of mi , qd and eof between the first spin and the last spin is not instantaneous but requires the formation time , and the longer the spin chain is , the more time to create correlations takes .",
    "in addition , the maximum amplitudes that the mi , qd and eof can reach all become smaller with the increase of the length of spin chain . however , the degrees of amplitude reduction are not same .",
    "for example , we consider @xmath70 from fig.[fig:6d ] , fig.[fig:7d ] , and fig.[fig:8d ] , we can see that the maximum amplitudes of mi and qd are about @xmath71 , while the maximal amplitude of eof is only about @xmath72 which implies that mi and qd are more robust to the length increase of the spin chain than eof .",
    "in the above section we have shown that the time needed to create correlations between the first spin and the last spin increases with the increase of the spin chain length .",
    "however , we still do not know how fast correlations can be created between the first spin and the last spin in our concrete model , though there is an obvious and correct answer : no faster than the lieb - robinson speed . in this section , we will numerically study the relation between the start - up time of correlations for different correlation measures and the length of spin chain .",
    "we aim to find out the propagation speed of correlations and investigate whether the propagation speed depends on the correlation measures .",

    "we define the criterion for correlation appearance , which can be used to judge whether the correlations have been created or not at a given time . in every subfigure of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , we plot three curves .",
    "different curves have different criteria of start - up @xmath75 , that is , the criteria of solid line , dashed line , and dotted - dashed line are @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . from fig . [ fig:9 ] , we observe that the start - up time as a function of the spin chain length has two segments , and there is a sudden switch point , which moves rightwards with the decrease of the criterion . from fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] , fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig:8d ] , we can see that there are a series of obvious peaks in the figures .",
    "in fact , the first segment in fig . [ fig:9 ]",
    "appears since the first peak reaches the criterion , and the second segment appears since the second peak reaches the criterion .",

    "[ fig:10b ] , the relation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 is also linear , but @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "so the first peak will disappear sooner than the second peak with the increase of @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the first peak becomes lower than the criterion with the increase of @xmath5 , but the second peak is still higher than the criterion .",
    "this is the reason for the appearance of switch point in fig .",

    "lastly , in order to investigate whether the propagation speed depends on the correlation measures , we plot them in the same figure with the criterion @xmath78 as shown in fig .",

    "we find that the propagation velocity does not depend on the correlation measures , but the sudden switch point depends on the correlation measures .",

    "the sudden switch of the generalized lieb - robinson velocities implies that different types of correlations may have different generalized lieb - robinson velocities . in the present model ,",
    "the amplitudes of these two types of correlations decreases exponentially with the length of the spin chain , and these two types of correlations are characterized by different exponential indexes .",
