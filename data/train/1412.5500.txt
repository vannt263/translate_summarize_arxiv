    "as a measurement of quantum entanglement in given systems , entanglement entropy is a fundamental notion in quantum physics . for example , in condensed matter physics it can be used to probe the quantum phase transitions near the critical point @xcite . considering a subregion @xmath0 with the remaining parts as @xmath1 ,",
    "the von neumann entanglement entropy of @xmath0 is @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the reduced density matrix for the subregion @xmath4 by tracing out the degrees of freedom of @xmath5 , while @xmath6 is the density matrix of the whole system .",
    "since entanglement entropy can measure the entanglement between subsystems , for a dynamical situation , the entanglement entropy can describe the evolution of quantum entanglement in the system .",
    "some interesting results have been obtained in  @xcite for @xmath7-dimension , in which some powerful results are available by using the techniques in conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "it was conjectured that entanglement propagating from small to large scales has an allowed maximum speed which is taken to be one .",
    "however , a natural extension to study the evolution of entanglement entropy for field theories in higher dimensions is very complicated .",
    "so far , few results are available from field theory approach .    in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite , the holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) was conjectured by ryu and takayanagi @xcite that the entanglement entropy of the subregion @xmath4 can be given by the following area law , [ hee ] s_hee= , in which @xmath8 is the minimal surface which ends at the border of subregion @xmath4 on the ads boundary , and @xmath9 is the newton s constant of the bulk gravity .",
    "the ryu - takayanagi proposal for the holographic derivation of entanglement entropy in static background was soon generalized to time dependent situations  @xcite and has been generically proven by  @xcite .",
    "this proposal provides an elegant and executable way to calculate entanglement entropy of a strongly coupled system which has a gravity dual .",
    "applications of the formula have been extended to a bunch of models , for reviews one can refer to @xcite .",
    "in particular , taking advantage of this holographic formula , time evolution of entanglement entropy has been studied recently in general space - time dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it was uncovered that there is a common linear growth of hee before it saturates into the final equilibrium states . actually , this linear growth of hee is reminiscent of the linear behaviour of entanglement entropy by field theory calculation  @xcite in @xmath7-dimension .",
    "more precisely , the authors of  @xcite showed that the entanglement entropy for a segment of width @xmath10 grows with time linearly as @xmath11 before saturation . in the above relation , @xmath12 represents the difference between the entanglement entropy from that at the initial time , while @xmath13 is the equilibrium thermal entropy density .",
    "this linear relation was also analytically studied in holographic aspects by the authors of  @xcite , in which the analogous velocity @xmath14 was introduced by the formula s_(t)=s_eq a_v_e t , with @xmath15 the  area \" of subregion @xmath16 one considered .",
    "they also speculated that the linear growth velocity had an upper bound for general dimensions .  ,",
    "@xmath17 , which is consistent with the cft calculation  @xcite . ]",
    "the behaviour of entanglement entropy for static case in some holographic superconductor ( superfluid ) models has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the entanglement entropy is a good probe to investigate the holographic phase transitions .",
    "it can indicate not only the appearance , but also the order of the phase transition . in this paper",
    ", we would like to generalise previous study to out of equilibrium situation , i.e. , to consider the dynamical evolution of hee in holographic superconductors .",
    "in particular , we adopt the basic model for the time evolution of holographic superconductor from  @xcite .   depending on the temperature of the system",
    ", the equilibrium state can be described by an ads reissner - nordstorm ( ads - rn ) black hole or a hairy black hole , corresponding to a  normal \" phase or a superconducting phase of the dual field theory , respectively .",
    "the authors of  @xcite quenched the system by a boundary scalar source of charged order parameter in terms of a gaussian type quench , and then they found three distinct regimes for the order parameters depending on the strength of the quench . in our paper , after reproducing the numerical results which perfectly match  @xcite , we study the dynamical hee with a strip geometry on this background",
    ". we would like to study how this non - local observable evolves compared to the scalar order parameter and whether hee can be used as a probe to detect different patterns of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "the gaussian quench is localised at a particular time , say @xmath18 .",
    "the quench has two parameters , one controls its amplitude and the other one controls the speed of quench . in order to compare with the results in  @xcite , we fix the later parameter as well and to study how the quench strength affects the hee . based on the explicit numerical calculation",
    ", we uncover some universal features of hee as a function of time , which is independent of the strength of quench . when the quench time is very near @xmath18 , hee as a function of time develops a small dip .",
    "the depth and slope of the dip depend on the quench strength . specifically , as quench is stronger the depth and slope of the dip will be larger .",
    "the physics behind this dip is still vague to us .",
    "as time goes beyond this dip , hee will perform a linear growth until it saturates to a particular value which depends on the quench strength and size of the strip subsystem .",
    "we find that hee will grow more rapidly if the quench is stronger during the linear regime . at the saturation time ,",
    "we find that there exists a continuous saturation if the width of the strip is relatively short ; however , if the width is long enough , we find a swallow tail of hee at the saturation time .",
    "this swallow tail behaviour can be understood by looking at multiple minimal area surfaces near the saturation time .",
    "for the entanglement entropy we need to choose the minimal area surface . after the saturation time",
    ", hee will enter the equilibrium states .",
    "we find that for a fixed width of the strip , stronger quenches will induce larger values of hee at equilibrium .",
    "physically , this can be understood that stronger quench will pump more energy or degrees of freedom into the system .",
    "we also analyse the time evolution of the event horizon and apparent horizon .",
    "we see that at late time they coincide together , since now it is in the equilibrium state . for large width of the strip ,",
    "the tip point of the minimal surface will also meet the horizons above , which can be easily understood from a geometry point of view : as the strip width is large enough the minimal surface probes deeply into the bulk .",
    "nevertheless , before the equilibrium time , the location of the event horizon , apparent horizon and the tip point of the minimal surface will not meet together .",
    "especially , evolving from the initial time , the tip point will cross the event horizon first , and then at late time it meets the horizon .",
    "we extract the linear growth velocity @xmath14 and the entanglement entropy density at final equilibrium states as a function of quench strength",
    ". both quantities increase with the quench strength and there is a particular quench strength where the behaviour of two quantities changes qualitatively .",
    "interestingly , this critical strength is the one that exceeding which the charged order parameter evolves into the normal states with an over - damped behaviour , which was studied in @xcite already . the saturated entanglement entropy density at late time versus quench strength exhibits power law behaviour but with different powers as the quench is smaller or larger than the critical value .    this paper is arranged as follows : in section [ sect : basic ] , we introduce the basic holographic setup ; we will reproduce the numerical results of the dynamical holographic superconductor after quench in section [ sect : hsc ] ; time evolution of hee will be shown in section [ sect : hee ] ; in section [ sect : pthee ] , we use the hee to probe the phase transition which is studied in section [ sect : hsc ] ; finally , we draw our conclusions and discussions in section [ sect : con ] .",
    "we adopt the 4-dimensional einstein - maxwell - complex scalar action as the model , [ action ] = d^4x , in which @xmath19 is the maxwell gauge field dual to the conserved current in the boundary identified as the weakly - gauged electromagnetic field in the context of superconductors , @xmath20 is the field strength , @xmath21 is the complex scalar field and @xmath22 is the radius of the ads spacetime .",
    "we will consider the time dependent and spatially homogenous and isotropic black hole background , its general form is like the vaidya form , [ metric ] ds^2= , in which @xmath23 is the ingoing eddington - finkelstein time coordinate while @xmath24 is the radial direction in the bulk and @xmath25 is the infinite boundary . for the static case ,",

    "@xmath98 , stronger quench will affect @xmath77 more quickly , since the time the ripples come out are smaller for stronger quenches .",

    "it also shows that at @xmath95 , @xmath77 is smaller for the strips with shorter width , this is understandable from many previous literatures that the tip points will be much closer to the horizon if the width of the strip is longer .",
    "even more , it will attach to the horizon if the width is long enough .",
    "as time goes beyond the dip , hee will perform a linear growth with @xmath93 , which can be intuitively seen from the right panels of fig.[3ls ] . for a fixed width @xmath89",

    "we plot the time evolution of apparent horizon , event horizon and the tip point @xmath77 in fig.[aeh ] with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "we can see that at the equilibrium states , the apparent horizon and the event horizon coincide as is expected .",
    "tip point @xmath77 for @xmath99 will also meet the horizon at the late time .",
    "however , if @xmath89 is short , @xmath77 will not attach to the horizon at late time , which can be seen for example from the left top plot in fig.[3ls ] for @xmath97 . there",
    ", for instance , when the quench strength @xmath110 , the tip point @xmath77 at equilibrium will stay at around @xmath111 , which is outside the horizon @xmath112 . at the equilibrium state in fig.[aeh ] , we can see that when quench is stronger , the horizons will be much closer to the boundary .",
    "meanwhile , the black hole surrounded by the horizon will be larger .",
    "this indicates that stronger quench will put more energy into the system and finally cross the horizon into black hole , thus makes black hole larger .",
    "the information is intricate when @xmath113 .",
    "it is interesting to see that for example @xmath110 , the tip point @xmath77 may enter into the event horizon at a certain time and then finally meets the horizon at equilibrium time .",
    "however , we can also find that before equilibrium time , the location of apparent is always behind the event horizon , which gives a consistent check for our numerics .",
    "( left ) the log - log plot for the linear growth velocity @xmath14 versus quench strength @xmath40 for @xmath97 ; ( right ) the log - log plot for regularized entanglement entropy density at equilibrium versus the quench strength @xmath40 for @xmath97 .",
    "red and green dashed lines are the fitted lines while the black dashed lines locate at @xmath58 . ]    as we mentioned in section [ sect : hsc ] that there exists a phase transition around @xmath58 , above which the hairy black hole at initial state will finally turn out to be a hairless black hole .",
    "we will try to uncover this phase transition by virtue of hee .",
    "actually , we do this from two points of view : one is from the behaviour of the linear growth velocity @xmath14 , see the left panel of fig.[loglog ] ; the other one is from the behaviour of entanglement entropy density at equilibrium , see the right panel of fig.[loglog ] . from fig.[vedelta ] , we can see that for @xmath97 each plot of @xmath14 or @xmath109 has a very tiny turning at @xmath58 . in order to make this tiny effect more apparent , we plot @xmath14 and @xmath109 for @xmath97 in the log - log figures in fig.[loglog ] . from the left panel",
    ", we see that the scaling behaviour of @xmath14 is qualitatively different in the vicinity of @xmath58 , which implies that @xmath58 is indeed a transition point .",
    "similar behaviors can also be found for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which we do not show in this paper .",
    "a more precise or quantitative analysis of this phase transition point will be shown in the following in terms of @xmath109 at equilibrium .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath109 can be found from the right panel of fig.[loglog ] .",
    "we can see that the lines have distinct slopes before and after @xmath58 , which also indicates that @xmath58 is a phase transition point .",
    "green and red dashed lines are the fitted lines before and after the critical point respectively .",
    "the linear behaviour in the log - log plot indicates that there is a power law scaling @xmath114 in the regular plot .",
    "the scaling behaviour @xmath114 for the green line is @xmath115 , while for the red line it is @xmath116 .",
    "we have also checked other strip width and found similar power law behaviour .",
    "therefore , we can indeed deduce the phase transition point at @xmath58 from the behaviour of hee .",
    "it is helpful to compare our hee results with charged order parameter used to probe the dynamical phase transitions . in the footnote  [ footnote ] of section  [",
    "sect : hsc ] , we mentioned that there also exists another ",
    "dynamical \" transition point at around @xmath117 , at which the order parameter will behave from oscillatory damping to un - oscillatory damping but still has finite equilibrium values  @xcite .",
    "however , from the analysis of hee we can not see such kind of transition at around @xmath117 .",
    "the time evolution of hee under quench shows a common behaviour independent of the strength of quench : it first develops a dip , then grows linearly and finally saturates .",
    "this seems reasonably as hee is a non - local quantity . a priori",
    ", the hee should behave more robust than local observables by changing external conditions , such as quench strength @xmath40 .",
    "one possible reason is probably that the  dynamical transition \" near @xmath117 is not a phase transition but a smooth crossover , therefore hee can not probe this .",
    "maybe there are still some hints in our data we ignored .",
    "it will be of great interest to investigate this issue in future .",
    "in this paper , we studied the dynamical evolution of entanglement entropy in a simple holographic superconductor model under an external gaussian quench .",
    "the system is driven from the initial condensed state to a far - from - equilibrium regime , and finally equilibrates to a different equilibrium state which depends on the strength of quench  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the hee for a strip region during the whole dynamical process .",
    "we found that the time evolution of hee exhibits a common non - monotonic behaviour independent of the size of strip and quench strength .",
    "there exists a small dip of hee near the quench time . the depth and slope of the dip depended on the quench strength .",
    "in particular , if the quench is stronger the dip is deeper and steeper",
    ". currently we do not know the exact physical meaning of the mysterious dip . beyond the dip , hee performs a famous linear growth with respect to the physical time for a boundary observer . by virtue of the formula in  @xcite , we calculated the velocity @xmath14 of this linear growth and found that there is a bound for @xmath14 when the width of the strip is not much short .",
    "besides , stronger quench would induce a faster linear growth of hee , which indicated that stronger quench would change the system more abruptly . at a critical time , hee would saturate into an equilibrium state .",
    "we found that if the width of the strip was large and the quench was strong , there exists a swallow tail at the critical time , otherwise the saturation at the critical time is continuous .",
    "in addition , when the quench is stronger , the final hee at equilibrium is larger .",
    "more importantly , we found that the phase transition point at @xmath58 can be deduced by analyzing the linear growth velocity and equilibrium entropy density of hee .",
    "however , the limitation by using hee to probe the phase transition is that it can not deduce the  dynamical \" transition point as we mentioned in the context",
    ". it will be of great interest to further study this in future time .",
    "of course , extending this strip model to disc on the boundary is an obvious extension .",
    "the initial condensed state in our study is at a non - vanishing temperature .",
    "depending on the strength of quench , this initial phase evolves to another equilibrium one with three distinct regimes for the behaviours of order parameters , which are precisely related to the spectrum of black hole quasi - normal modes @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider the initial state with vanishing temperature , which corresponds to the ground state of our superconducting system .",
    "if one turns on particular quench , the system will equilibrate at late time with a higher temperature .",
    "form the gravity point of view , that is because the quench can inject energy into black hole .",
    "we expect that the dynamical evolution of the order parameter under quenches would not change qualitatively",
    ". however , the hee may exhibit additional behaviour during the thermalization process from the ground state at vanishing temperature .",
    "one can also generalise previous study to other gravity background , especially for ads soliton which is confined and thus has been used to mimic insulator @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of hee in static case in such insulator / superconductor phase transition has been investigated in the literature .",
    "it was shown that the hee exhibits distinct behaviour in ads soliton compared to black hole case .",
    "it will be interesting to uncover the evolution of condensate and hee after turning on quenches in this confined geometry .",
