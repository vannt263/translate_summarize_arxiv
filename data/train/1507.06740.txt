    "schur polynomials is an ubiquitous object in mathematics and mathematical physics , ranging from representation theory , combinatorics , enumerative geometry to knot theory .",
    "being one of the most fundamental symmetric polynomials , extensive studies and numerous combinatorial identities have been found for the schur polynomials .",
    "many mathematical objects are introduced for which the schur polynomials serves as a building block since one can use various properties found for the schur polynomials .",
    "one typical example is a stochastic process called the schur process @xcite whose probability measure is given by the schur polynomials , from its property many useful combinatorial formulae can be employed to study the dynamics of the process .",
    "the schur polynomials itself has many expressions .",
    "one of the most famous ones is the jacobi - trudi identity which expresses schur polynomials in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials . besides these traditional identities , a very interesting formula called the tokuyama formula @xcite",
    "was found which expresses schur polynomials in a combinatorial form .",
    "the distinctive feature of the formula is that the expression is given in terms not only of the symmetric variables but also with an additional parameter which does not appear in the original definition of the schur polynomials .",
    "specializing the additional parameter , the tokuyama formula reduces to the determinant formula , weyl character formula and so on . in this sense",
    ", the tokuyama formula can be viewed as a deformation of weyl character .",
    "recently , the tokuyama formula has found its interpretation in terms of integrable vertex models @xcite .",
    "the idea to understand this tokuyama formula from the point of view of quantum integrability is to extend the @xmath1-operator for the free - fermion model ( the corresponding @xmath2-matrix is the trigonometric felderhof model ) to an @xmath1-operator including an additional parameter besides the spectral parameter .",
    "the newly - introduced parameter plays the role of refining the combinatorial expression for the schur polynomials .",
    "this idea of relating tokuyama formula which is a deformation of weyl character formula to integrable vertex models have been recently generalized to the factorial schur polynomials @xcite and other types of symmetric polynomials @xcite by introducing inhomogeneous parameters or changing boundary conditions .    in this paper",
    ", we present another type of combinatorial formula for the schur polynomials with an additional parameter by investigating a partition function of an integrable six - vertex model .",
    "we find the following combinatorial formula for the schur polynomials @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 are strict partitions satisfying the interlacing relations @xmath7 , @xmath8 is fixed by the young diagram @xmath9 as @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denotes the number of parts in @xmath12 which are not in @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain this combinatorial formula from an integrable six - vertex model .",
    "the six - vertex model we consider can be regarded as a certain degeneration of a @xmath0-deformed non - hermitian boson model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction seems to be analyzed by the coordinate bethe ansatz @xcite which at the degeneration point is given by the schur polynomials times a factor including an additional parameter . to obtain the combinatorial formula , we investigate the corresponding model from the point of view of the quantum inverse scattering method , i.e. , starting from the @xmath1-operator which is the most fundamental object in quantum integrable models .",
    "we view the wavefunction as a partition function of a six - vertex model and evaluate it in two ways .",
    "first , we evaluate the partition function directly to show that it is given by a schur polynomials times an additional factor .",
    "another way of evaluation is to take the viewpoint that the partition function consists of a layer of @xmath14-operators , and calculate the matrix elements of a single @xmath14-operator to show a summation formula for the partition function . combining the two expressions give the combinatorial formula .    besides the combinatorial formula",
    ", we examine the scalar products and present an algebraic analytic proof for its determinant form , which combined with the wavefunction gives us the celebrated cauchy formula for the schur polynomials .",
    "we also make an application of the domain wall boundary partition function to show a simple formula for a particular generating function of alternating sign matrices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the integrable six - vertex model as a particular degeneration of a non - hermitian @xmath0-deformed boson model in the next section .",
    "we give an algebraic analytic proof for the scalar product in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5",
    ", we evaluate the matrix elements and the wavefunction of the six - vertex model .",
    "we combine the results of sections 3 , 4 and 5 to present the combinatorial formulae for the schur polynomials in section 6 . in section 7",
