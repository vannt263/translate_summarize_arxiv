    "the existence and nature of deconfined phase(s ) of qcd at high baryon density is one of the open key issues of the theory of strong interaction @xcite . progresses in this field",
    "are heavily delayed by the absence of a direct method of numerical simulation based on an importance sampling monte carlo scheme . in order",
    "to , at least partially , overcome this _",
    "empasse _ ,",
    "analytical approaches in the strong coupling limit using the lagrangian @xcite or hamiltonian @xcite , @xcite approaches , as well as other indirect methods , have been proposed in the last years , which in principle allow to extract physical informations of the behaviour of the vacuum of qcd in the portion of the space parameter that is not accessible to direct numerical simulations . between the previously denoted indirect methods it is worthwhile to cite the imaginary chemical potential approach and the doubly reweighting method @xcite .",
    "following this line we have recently proposed a different approach to the problem , which we hope can greatly help to improve the knowlegde in the field @xcite . in this",
    "proceeding we present a concise description of the method , some results of the test carried out in an exactly solvable model ( 3-dimensional gross - neveu at non zero baryon density in the large n limit ) and finally discuss the new results we obtained concerning the phase structure of qcd with four flavour of light quarks at finite temperature and baryon density @xcite .",
    "starting from the usual discretization of qcd with staggered fermions with the chemical potential term introduced _ a l _ hasenfratz and karsch    @xmath1    we generalize the action introducing two independent parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 : the coefficient of the antihermitian and hermitian terms in the temporal part of the fermionic action .",
    "the usual action is recovered when @xmath4 and @xmath5    @xmath6    as in the case of ( [ hkaction ] ) this action suffers , in general , from the sign problem ; only when @xmath2 is real and @xmath7 is imaginary the model defined through ( [ xyaction ] ) can be simulated with standard monte carlo methods .",
    "note that the case of imaginary chemical potential is a particular line in this subspace , defined by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "studying the phase structure in the parameter space defined from @xmath10 , @xmath2 and @xmath11 and performing an analytical continuation to real values of @xmath3 we can recover the phase structure of the original model .    in ref .",
    "the reader can find an accurate discussion of what we expect for the phase structure in the ( @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13 ) planes and the motivations for such guess ; it is of little interest , in our opinion , to repeat that discussion here , because we want to concentrate on the results concerning the critical line in the ( @xmath14 t ) plane .",
    "assuming this attitude , let us sketch in some detail the procecdure used to extract the critical line in the cases under examination in the rest of the paper , _",
    "i.e. _ gross - neveu model in three dimension and four flavours qcd .    not to work in a three parameter space",
    "we can look at the critical line in two dimensional sections ; in particular we can choose to work at fixed @xmath10 , in the ( @xmath2,@xmath11 ) plane or at fixed @xmath2 , in the ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) plane .",
    "in the first case we work at @xmath10 smaller than the critical value of the zero density case and look for a critical line that starts from the @xmath15 axis moving towards larger values of @xmath2 and @xmath11 .",
    "this can be acomplished performing simulations at fixed @xmath11 for several values of @xmath2 starting from @xmath16 and repeating the procedure for several times at different values of @xmath11 .",
    "having determined the critical line in the ( @xmath13 ) plane we can fit it with an even function of @xmath11 and analytically continue the line in the ( @xmath12 ) plane . at this point the intersection of this line with the @xmath17 line , that corresponds to real values of the chemical potential , determines the critical value of @xmath18 for the given @xmath10 . repeating the whole procedure for several values of @xmath10 will determine several points on the critical line in the ( @xmath19 ) plane ; values in physical units can be obtained using the perturbative two - loop beta function .",
    "the second alternative is simply described by exchanging the role of @xmath10 and @xmath2 .",
    "we work at fixed @xmath20 and look for lines in the ( @xmath21 ) plane , analitycally continue to the ( @xmath22 ) plane and intersect them with @xmath23 to get the critical values in the ( @xmath19 ) plane , as before .",
    "the gross - neveu model ( _ i.e. _ four - fermi model in 2 + 1 dimensions ) is an ideal test bench for our approach : in the chiral limit it posseses a phase structure in the ( @xmath24,t ) plane that is similar to the one expected for four flavour qcd and it can be analytically solved in the large n limit ; the exact solution allows us to determine the critical line in the ( @xmath13 ) plane for a fixed @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "1 the whole procedure is illustrated ( take in mind that the variable in horizontal axis is @xmath11 for the upper curve and @xmath3 for the two lower curves ) .    repeating this procedure for others values of @xmath10 produces the critical structure of the model in the ( @xmath25 ) plane depicted in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure",
    "the symbols stand for the critical points obtained with our method , the continuous line represents the exact results for @xmath26 and the dashed line is what can be obtained in the same situation performing an analytical extension starting from results obtained working in the imaginary chemical potential approach ( in all cases the analytical extrapolations rely on quadratic fits ) .",
    "it is evident a clear advantage in using our new method for increasing chemical potential values @xcite .",
    "while in the gross - neveu model we start from data ( the critical points at imaginary values of @xmath3 ) obtained solving seminumerically the gap equation , for qcd we have to rely uniquely on monte carlo simulation . for this purpose we choose to work with a hybrid monte carlo code for staggered fermions .",
    "the lattices we have used , due to the fact that our method is quite expensive from a computational point of view ( for any point in the ( @xmath24,t ) plane we have to run the monte carlo to span a two dimensional space ) , are limited to @xmath27 volumes at most .",
    "we choose a quark mass of @xmath28 in order to compare with existing results obtained with imagianry chemical poterntial and doubly reweighting methods @xcite .",
    "for each value of @xmath2 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 we run around @xmath29 molecular dynamics trajectories of unit time , measuring plaquette , chiral condensate and polyakov loop for each trajectory .",
    "the simulations have been performed on linux clusters for a total of 100000 cpu hours .",
    "we have worked , here , in the fixed @xmath2 scheme , choosing 5 values of @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath18 of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for each @xmath2 value",
    "we perform a search of the critical point in @xmath10 for a number of @xmath11 values varying from 6 to 9 , using a ferrenberg - swendsen procedure to precisely determine the critical values . in all cases",
    "the signal from the susceptibilities of the three observables we used gave identical results for the extimation of the critical points .",
    "the transition line was found to be a first order one , with a latent heat essentially independent of the @xmath11 value .",
    "for the following stage we fitted the critical line in the ( @xmath35 ) plane , for each @xmath2 , with a second order even polynomial :    @xmath36    it is straightforward to continue the critical line to real values of @xmath3 and intersect with the @xmath37 vertical line to obtain the corresponding critical coupling @xmath38 . as the latent heat was constant along the line in the ( @xmath35 ) plane , we assume his analytical extension shares the same behaviour ; hence we can affirm that the transitions at different @xmath18 are still first order , as the one at @xmath39 .",
    "this procedure is sketched in fig . 3 for a representative value of @xmath2 ( as before the horizontal axis is @xmath11 for the upper curve and @xmath3 for the lower one ) .",
    "repeating this procedure for the five values of @xmath2 ( or @xmath18 ) we have chosen we obtain the critical line in the ( @xmath40 ) plane @xcite . at this point",
    "we can rewrite our results in physical units , as reported in fig .",
    "4 , setting the scale with the critical temperature at @xmath39 and using the two loop beta function . in this figure there",
    "are also shown results obtained by delia and lombardo @xcite using the imaginary chemical potential approach as well as a fit of out results with a power law :    @xmath41^p \\label{powerfit}\\ ] ]    note that , if we take seriously this ansatz for the critical line in the ( @xmath42 ) plane , this leads to a prediction of the critical chemical potential at zero temperature of @xmath43 mev .",
