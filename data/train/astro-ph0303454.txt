    "r - modes in inviscid , rotating , relativistic stars ( in which the coriolis force acts as the restoring force to produce periodic fluid motions ) are generically unstable to the emission of gravitational waves ( andersson 1998 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ) , whose back - reaction produces a growth of the modes by the mechanism first studied by chandrasekhar ( 1970 ) and by friedman & schutz ( 1978a , b ; `` cfs instability '' ) .    in neutron stars at low temperatures @xmath1 , the long mean free path of the fluid particles allows rapid momentum exchange over macroscopic lengthscales ( shear viscosity ) , impeding the growth of the modes ( lindblom et al .",
    "1998 ) . at high @xmath1 ,",
    "the successive compression and expansion of a fluid element ( a small effect for r - modes , unless the stellar rotation rate , @xmath3 , is extremely fast ; e.g. , lindblom & owen 2002 ) leads to a departure from the chemical equilibrium conditions , inducing reactions ( typically weak interactions ) which tend to restore the equilibrium state .",
    "since these reactions occur out of equilibrium , they constitute irreversible processes that dissipate energy and create entropy , extracting mechanical energy from the oscillation modes while increasing the temperature of the fluid and/or leading to the emission of neutrinos from the star .    the competition between the destabilizing effect of the gravitational radiation reaction , which is strongly dependent on @xmath3 , and the damping effect of the temperature - dependent shear and bulk viscosity generically defines one or two `` instability regions '' for low - amplitude r - modes at high @xmath3 and intermediate @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in these regions ,",
    "the mode amplitude grows exponentially , until it is choked by cooling or feeds back on @xmath3 and @xmath1 ( and itself ) through heating or gravitational - radiation torque .",
    "studies done so far of the evolution of young neutron stars under this instability ( e.g. , owen et al . 1998 ; lindblom & owen 2002 ) include amplification and damping of r - modes by the above - mentioned effects in the linear regime , spin - down due to gravitational waves , and passive cooling , ignoring the nonlinear terms and the heating associated with the bulk viscosity .",
    "these effects are included in the present work , in addition to a probably more realistic treatment of angular momentum loss , motivated by the model case studied by levin & ushomirsky ( 2001a ) .",
    "in the simplest case , namely neutron star matter composed only of neutrons ( @xmath4 ) , protons ( @xmath5 ) , and electrons ( @xmath6 ) , the equilibrium state is set by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the chemical potential of particle species @xmath9 . in the simplest approximation",
    ", we consider non - interacting particles , of which the neutrons and protons are non - relativistic , satisfying @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the respective fermi momenta and number densities , and the electrons are extremely relativistic , with @xmath13 .",
    "if the total density @xmath14 is perturbed by an amount @xmath15 , at constant ( charge - neutral ) composition , the equilibrium state is perturbed by @xmath16    the equilibrium state can be restored by the `` modified urca reactions '' ( hereafter _ murca _ ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron neutrino and antineutrino , and @xmath21 is a `` bystander nucleon '' whose identity is not changed , but whose function is to absorb momentum in order to allow for overall momentum conservation in the reaction , given that the neutron fermi momentum is much larger than that of all the other particles involved .",
    "the net rate @xmath22 of these reactions ( net lepton number emitted per unit volume per unit time ) is limited by the available phase space , increasing both with temperature , @xmath1 , and with @xmath0 .",
    "the associated energy dissipation rate is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , and the neutrino emissivity ( energy emitted in the form of neutrinos and antineutrinos per unit time per unit volume ) takes a similar form ,    @xmath25    with the equilibrium value @xmath26 ( see reisenegger 1995 ) .",
    "studies of neutron star evolution so far have considered only the lowest - order term in @xmath27 in each of these expressions , which yield the linear bulk viscosity and equilibrium neutrino cooling of the star , respectively . here , we consider the full expression for both .",
    "equation ( 1 ) shows that , at high amplitudes , the dissipation increases much more strongly than predicted by linear theory , potentially providing a saturation mechanism that impedes the unlimited growth of the amplitude .",
    "in addition , we note that the net heating of the neutron star is given by the difference @xmath28 , a fourth - order polynomial in @xmath29 whose zeroth and first - order terms are negative whereas the three higher powers are positive .",
    "thus , for small - amplitude oscillations , the star undergoes net cooling ( somewhat faster than in equilibrium at the same @xmath1 ) , whereas at high amplitudes it is heated more and more strongly .    in the inner core of a neutron star , additional particles may appear , such as the ( baryonic ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 hyperons .",
    "their presence changes the equilibrium abundances , increasing the proton - to - neutron ratio and probably allowing the much faster `` direct urca reactions '' ( hereafter _ durca _ ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , to take place , conserving momentum without the need of a `` bystander particle '' . for these , the quantitative details are slightly different from the _ murca _ case ( see reisenegger 1995 for the explicit expressions ) , but the qualitative properties discussed above still hold .",
    "in addition , the hyperons give rise to the additional reactions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which contribute to the bulk viscosity , substantially reducing the unstable region in the @xmath36 plane , probably to two small and disjoint `` windows '' ( see fig . 1 and lindblom & owen 2002 ) .",
    "these reactions emit no neutrinos , and therefore always have a heating effect .",
    "the rates of these reactions have only been calculated in the small - amplitude ( `` linear '' ) limit ( jones 2001 ; lindblom & owen 2002 ) , but we extrapolate them into the nonlinear regime by using the expressions obtained by madsen ( 1992 ) for the analogous processes in quark matter , @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution of the star is modeled by coupled first - order differential equations for @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and the dimensionless mode amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath1 is determined by the heating and cooling processes discussed in the previous section , and that of @xmath38 by the mentioned competition between the destabilizing gravitational radiation reaction and the stabilizing viscous effects .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 deserves some additional comments .    in the instability conditions derived by friedman & schutz ( 1978b ) , a crucial role",
    "is played by the so - called `` canonical angular momentum '' associated with the mode , a quadratic functional of the displacement field which is related ( though possibly not identical ) to the physical angular momentum of the mode . in previous studies of the evolution of neutron stars under this instability ( e.g. , owen et al . 1998 ) , it was assumed that the total angular momentum of the star is the sum of a term corresponding to a rigid rotation , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the star s ( constant ) moment of inertia , plus the canonical angular momentum of the mode .",
    "furthermore , it was assumed that only the latter term is modified by the gravitational radiation reaction force , whereas the stellar rotation rate can be changed only by viscous dissipation of the modes , which would transfer angular momentum from one term to the other .",
    "for one specific model problem ( a thin spherical shell ) , levin & ushomirsky ( 2001a ) were able to show that these assumptions are incorrect .",
    "for this case , the r - modes have no physical angular momentum , i.e. , do not contribute to the total angular momentum of the star , which is exactly @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath39 is changed by the gravitational waves , as there is no other angular momentum available for them to carry away .",
    "there is no proof that these results can be extrapolated to the much more complicated case of a complete neutron star .",
    "however , given that the previously made assumptions are rather special and have been disproved in the only available model case , we choose to base our evolutionary model on the results of levin & ushomirsky , taking the total angular momentum to be given by @xmath39 and its derivative to be equal to minus the angular momentum carried away by the gravitational waves .",
    "we have tracked the evolution of a young neutron star for three different scenarios , which are determined by the instability boundaries shown in fig .",
    "1 . our numerical simulations start with the same initial conditions as in owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , i.e. , an initial temperture @xmath41 and an initial rotation rate @xmath42 , about the maximum rotation the star can sustain without disrupting due to the centrifugal force , where @xmath43 is the mean density of the star .",
    "our first scenario is a neutron star composed only of neutrons , protons and electrons , where its bulk viscosity is caused by _ murca",
    "_ reactions ( fig .",
    "non - linear bulk viscosity is unable to saturate the r - modes on its own , so they can grow to amplitudes @xmath44 , spinning down the star within an hour .",
    "reheating is weak compared to neutrino emission , leading only to a delay in the cooling of the star , but not to a net temperature increase . since other saturation mechanisms can be active ( arras et al .",
    "2002 ) , we have saturated the r - modes artificially ( as in owen et al .",
    "1998 ) by an ad hoc damping force whose work is directly dissipated into heat .",
    "this leads to a rapid and substantial temperature increase , depending on the saturation amplitude , until the star is hot enough for neutrino cooling to become stronger . for saturation amplitudes @xmath45 , as for the unsaturated case ,",
    "the heat gain is not enough to raise the temperature and only delays the cooling .",
    "however , the spin - down timescale becomes much longer , @xmath46 hours .",
    "this mechanism can in principle explain the inexistence of very rapidly rotating , young neutron stars .",
    "however , with our current understanding of the microphysics , the instability boundary restricts the final rotation periods ( after spin - down through this mechanism ) only to @xmath47 ms , not to the observed @xmath48 ms . in our second scenario (",
    "not plotted ) , we consider the presence of hyperons in the inner core of the neutron star , contributing the relatively low bulk viscosity estimated by jones ( 2001 ) and allowing _ durca _ processes to take place .",
    "the evolution is similar to our first scenario , but happens at lower temperatures ( @xmath49 ) , allowing some temperature increase to occur once the mode amplitude is large .",
    "our third scenario is basically the same as the second one , but the contribution of hyperon bulk viscosity is taken to be large ( as suggested by lindblom & owen 2002 ) , so as to split the unstable region in two ( fig .",
    "1 ) . due to the rapid _ durca",
    "_ cooling , the high - temperature unstable region is passed through in seconds , and initially small - amplitude r - modes do not have enough time to grow significantly .",
    "it takes about a year for the neutron star to cool down to the second unstable region , which is avoided due to the large spin - down if the magnetic field of the star is large , @xmath50 g or greater .",
    "if the magnetic field is weaker , the star enters this unstable region , and the r - modes grow until the heat released by viscous dissipation is large enough to raise the temperature , leading the star back to the stable region where it came from .",
    "then , the r - modes are damped until neutrino cooling moves the star back to the unstable region .",
    "the cycle repeats until an equilibrium between amplitude - dependent heating and neutrino cooling is achieved and the star stabilizes with a fixed amplitude ( @xmath51 ) very close to the instability boundary ( fig .",
    "the star then evolves along the instability boundary , spinning down due to the combination of magnetic dipole braking ( which dominates for magnetic fields larger than @xmath52 g , as inferred for `` classical '' , young pulsars ) and gravitational radiation , providing a persistent source of graviational radiation for @xmath53 .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the evolution found by andersson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for strange stars , but with an important difference .",
    "since those authors do not consider reheating nor a magnetic field , the timescale for the evolution along the instability boundary is set by the star s cooling process rather than the magnetic torque .",
    "we have found that the non - linear bulk viscosity terms cause no dramatic changes in the evolution of a young neutron star . they can decrease the maximum amplitude achieved by the r - modes , but can not completely saturate the modes .",
    "the reheating makes the rapid spin - down phase take place at higher temperatures , possibly simplifiying the models by avoiding the formation of a solid crust and a superfluid core .",
    "the most important consequence of reheating is that , with strong bulk viscosity at sufficiently low temperatures , it can balance neutrino cooling , keeping the star close to the instability boundary , and turning it into a persistent source of gravitational radiation for hundreds of years .",
    "the possible importance of the nonlinear terms in the bulk viscosity was realized , independently of us , by p. arras , and that of reheating through bulk viscosity by y. levin .",
    "our work on this topic was initiated during a. r.s participation in the program on `` spin and magnetism in young neutron stars '' at the itp in santa barbara , organized by l. bildsten .",
    "a. r. thanks many of the participants of that program , but specially g. ushomirsky and s. morsink , for teaching him about r - modes and the cfs instability .",
    "we are also grateful to l. lindblom for information about his work , and the organizers of the marsala workshop for their efforts , which made an excellent conference happen .",
