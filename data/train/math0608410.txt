    "summation to the least term ( optimal truncation of series ) can be traced back to cauchy s study of the gamma function ( see cauchy ( 1882))[cauchy ] .",
    "the method was applied by stokes ( see stokes ( 1904))[stokes ] to solutions of differential equations and was instrumental in his theory of stokes phenomenon .",
    "optimal truncation techniques have been greatly improved by dingle ( 1973)[dingle a ] , and in recent years as a result of the new ideas and methods of hyperasymptotics introduced by berry ( 1989 ) , who also discovered a surprisingly universal transition in hyperasymptotics , often called berry smoothing [ berry - smooth2 ] .",
    "rigorous results on optimal truncation and smoothing under various assumptions were proved by mcleod ( 1992 ) ( [ mcleod]second order linear equations ) , paris ( 1992 ) [ paris1](linear systems with power coefficients ) , olver ( 1995 ) [ olver1 a](gamma function ) , olver and olde daalhuis ( 1995a , b ) [ olver - daalh1 ] ( linear second order systems ) [ olver - daalh2 ] , olde daalhuis ( 1995 , 1996 ) [ daalhuis ] ( linear second order systems ) , the authors ( 1996 ) ( [ ck1 a]first order nonlinear and second order linear ) and others .",
    "a wide range of interesting applications were considered by berry and howls [ berry - howls ] [ berry - hyp ] ( 1990 , 1993 ) ( saddle point integrals ) , berry and keating ( 1992 ) ( asymptotics of the zeta function ) and berry ( 1991 , 1994 , 1995)[berry - zet ] [ berry - eva ] [ berry - gamma ] ( asymptotics of the gamma function , applications to dynamical systems , and pde s ) . other techniques of exponentially improved asymptotics have found interesting applications in dynamical systems ( see neishtadt 1984 , [ neishtadt ] ramis and schfke 1996 ) .",
    "[ ramis ]    in this paper we prove that asymptotic series of solutions of generic analytic ( linear or nonlinear ) differential systems near irregular singularities are summable to the least term , with errors of the order of magnitude of the least term with respect to the functions associated to the series by a specific generalized borel summation ( the balanced average ) .",
    "in fact we show that the same is true for all series components of the transseries solutions of such differential systems .",
    "we show that berry smoothing extends to this class of asymptotic series",
    ".    we deal with equations of the form    @xmath5    for large @xmath6 in some direction , and study solutions that go to zero in this limit .",
    "the assumptions on ( [ eqor1 ] ) are    ( a1 ) the function @xmath7 is analytic at @xmath8 .",
    "( a2 ) the eigenvalues @xmath9 of the linearization    @xmath10    are different from zero and nonresonnant ( cf . ",
    "[ nonres ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a large class of differential systems are not presented in the form described above but can be brought to it by suitable changes of variables .",
    "for example , under the change of variables @xmath11 , the airy equation @xmath12 becomes    @xmath13    also , the painlev i equation @xmath14 becomes    @xmath15    by taking @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 . in this form , written as systems , both equations satisfy our assumptions ( see  [ nonres ] and the notes therein ) .",
    "the transformations themselves , when they exist , are readily obtained by comparing the complete formal solution ( transseries ) of the original equation with the transseries of the normalized equation , ( [ eqformgen , n ] ) below .",
    "it is convenient to pull out the inhomogeneous and the linear terms ( relevant to leading order asymptotics ) and rewrite the system in the form    @xmath18    under the assumptions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) equation ( [ eqor ] ) admits , in normalized form , an @xmath19parameter family of formal exponential series solutions    @xmath20    ( see  [ sec : normal ] ) where @xmath21 are formal power series .",
    "we study those formal solutions ( [ eqformgen , n ] ) which are at the same time _",
    "asymptotic expansions _",
    "( or proper transseries , in the sense of calle 1993[ecalle - book a][ecalle a ] ) . in our context , only _",
    "finitely _ many powers can be present , of any exponential which is _ not small _ in the given direction .",
    "note however that any exponential will decrease in _ some _ direction , and our analysis eventually covers an @xmath22 parameter family of formal solutions .    for _ linear _ equations ,",
    "any formal solutions ( [ eqformgen , n ] ) contain finitely many exponentials and are proper transseries .",
    "for nonlinear equations we require , for large @xmath6 in a given direction @xmath23 in @xmath24 , that @xmath25 for any @xmath26 such that @xmath27 ( more details in  [ sec : normal ] ) .",
    "we start by illustrating the various concepts on a very simple example . the equation @xmath28 has the general solution @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the general _ formal _ solution for large @xmath6 is the elementary transseries @xmath31 with @xmath32 arbitrary . if @xmath33 , the exponential term is large and classical asymptotics gives full meaning to the family @xmath34 : for each @xmath34 there is a unique actual solution @xmath35 of the equation such that @xmath36 for large @xmath6 .",
    "but as @xmath37 crosses an antistokes line @xmath38 into a sector where @xmath39 decays , @xmath40 becomes small _ beyond all orders _ of the divergent series and is undefined ( as part of @xmath34 ) in classical asymptotics .",
    "classical asymptotics gives up the exponential and retains the information that all solutions are asymptotic to @xmath41 . in this framework",
    "there is no natural way for asymptotically choosing any privileged solution as corresponding to @xmath41 ; @xmath41 becomes more of a property of the differential equation as a whole , shared by all its particular solutions .    in terms of estimating solutions out of @xmath41 , classical asymptotics",
    "provides _ polynomial _ precision : @xmath42}|\\le \\mbox{const.}|x|^{-n-2}$ ] for large @xmath6 , where @xmath43}:=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}k!x^{-k-1}$ ] .",
    "one of the most convenient and frequently used techniques going beyond poincar asymptotics is summation to the least term .",
    "when @xmath6 is very large , the terms of @xmath41 start by decreasing rapidly ( @xmath44 if @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is tempting to keep adding these terms as long as they continue to decrease .",
    "the least term , for @xmath46 , evaluates to @xmath47 . even taking into account the slight ambiguity as to where to stop adding the terms , the numerical precision attained at this stage appears to be high enough to measure the small exponential beyond all orders .",
    "it turns out that in any direction towards infinity there exists ( see e.g. costin and kruskal 1996[ck1 b ] ) an actual solution of the equation which lies within @xmath48 of the optimally truncated @xmath41 ( a nearest solution ) ; this solution , @xmath49 , is then necessarily unique for any fixed @xmath37 , since different solutions are separated by @xmath50 .    as a manifestation of the stokes phenomenon , the association between @xmath41 and @xmath49 changes with @xmath51 . in our example @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 when @xmath55 .    since the solutions @xmath49 do not have singularities for large @xmath6",
    ", nothing abrupt should happen to the terms beyond all orders , either .",
    "michael berry discovered that there is indeed an intermediate range @xmath56 where the constant @xmath57 changes smoothly , in a surprisingly universal way .",
    "we prove that berry smoothing applies to all nonlinear systems satisfying ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , and the transition function is the same for all these systems .",
    "technically , we show that berry smoothing is governed by the dominant behavior at the singularities in borel space nearest to the origin , and these singularities have the same essential features for all equations within our class . going beyond nonresonance , the picture changes . however",
    ", properly interpreted , berry smoothing might persist in many resonant cases .",
    "see appendix 2 for a discussion .    as in the toy model above , in some cases ( linear homogeneous second order and first order equations notably , see costin and kruskal 1996[ck1 c ] ) there is _ only one _ solution of the original differential equation nearest to the divergent series . in general",
    "there is a restricted family of such solutions .",
    "olver s ( 1964 ) example illustrates very well that these special solutions might not be the obvious ones .",
    "at least for this reason it is important to identify a method of recovering them from their transseries .",
    "hyperasymptotics as introduced by berry leads to a substantial improvement in precision over optimal truncation but nevertheless ends up with nonzero errors .",
    "recent very interesting developments of the original ideas of berry due to olde daalhuis ( 1996)[olver1 b ] , [ daalhuis b ] suggest that for some linear differential equations hyperasymptotics may eliminate all errors , but unfortunately at the price of giving up the convenience of optimal truncation by adding up vastly more terms beyond the least one in an extended family of expansions .    at present",
    "the only technique which at the same time gives full account of the complete formal solutions and is widely applicable is generalized borel summation ( see calle 1981 and 1993[ecalle - book b ] [ ecalle b ] , and also costin 1995 and 1997[costin][costin++a ] for rigorous results in the context of ( [ eqor ] ) ) . in this paper",
    "we show that there is a natural connection between borel summation and optimal truncation , and that optimal truncation is compatible to a unique summation procedure , the balanced averaging introduced in costin ( 1997)[costin++b ] .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( those eigenvalues contained in the _ open _ half - plane @xmath61 centered along @xmath62 ) .",

    "\\(2 ) the complex numbers in the set @xmath66 ( note : the set is _ finite _ ) have _ distinct _ directions .",
    "these are the stokes lines @xmath67 .    that the set of @xmath68 which satisfy ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) has full measure follows from the fact that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) follow from the condition :    @xmath69    indeed , if ( [ strongnonr ] ) fails , one of @xmath70 is a rational function with rational coefficients of the other @xmath71 and @xmath72 , corresponding to a zero measure set in @xmath73 .    * notes*. ( i ) since only small exponentials are allowed in a proper transseries , our conditions only restrict those ( sets of ) eigenvalues which are associated , through ( [ eqformgen , n ] ) , to exponentials that can be simultaneously _ small _ in some direction .",

    "<S> we prove that for divergent series solutions of nonlinear ( or linear ) differential systems near a generic irregular singularity , the common prescription of summation to the least term is , if properly interpreted , meaningful and correct , and we extend this method to transseries solutions . in every direction in the complex plane at the singularity ( stokes directions _ not _ excepted ) there exists a nonempty set of solutions whose difference from the `` optimally '' ( i.e. , near the least term ) truncated asymptotic series is of the same ( exponentially small ) order of magnitude as the least term of the series .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a family of generalized borel summation formulas @xmath0 which commute with the usual algebraic and analytic operations ( addition , multiplication , differentiation , etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is exactly one of them , @xmath1 , such that for any formal series solution @xmath2 , @xmath3 differs from the optimal truncation of @xmath2 by at most the order of the least term of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in addition that the berry ( 1989 ) smoothing phenomenon is universal within this class of differential systems . whenever the terms `` beyond all orders '' _ change _ in crossing a stokes line , these terms vary smoothly on the berry scale @xmath4 and the transition is always given by the error function ; under the same conditions we show that dingle s rule of signs for stokes transitions holds . </S>"
