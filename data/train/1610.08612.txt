    "these basis functions decompose the hilbert space into a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces associated with different resolutions .",
    "basis functions on the different resolution subspaces are related by unitary scale transformations .",
    "local fields can be expanded in this basis .",
    "this replaces the operator - valued distributions by infinite linear combinations of basis functions with operator - valued coefficients .",
    "the operator valued coefficients are defined by smearing the local fields with the basis functions . while the full expansion is exact , there are natural volume and resolution truncations that are defined by retaining only terms in the expansion that have support intersecting a given volume and with a finest resolution .",
    "we limit our considerations to the use of hamiltonian methods , however the representations used in this paper could also be employed in any field theory framework to provide natural volume and resolution truncations .",
    "they could also be utilized in alternative wavelet approaches @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite . when the fields are replaced by these expansions in field - theory hamiltonians , local products of field operators are replaced infinite linear combinations of products of well - defined operators .",
    "the singularities that arise from the local operator products reappear as non - convergence of sums , so the renormalization problem takes on a different form .",
    "the theory is naturally regularized by truncating the basis .",
    "the problem of constructing a local limit involves first solving the field equations for the truncated theories with different volume and resolution cutoffs , and adjusting dimensionless parameters of each truncated field theory to preserve some common observables .",
    "these are systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom that can in principle be solved , just like lattice truncations .",
    "the problem is to identify a sequence of truncated theories and a limiting procedure that results in a well - defined infinite - volume , infinite - resolution limit that satisfies the axioms of a local field theory .",
    "the existence of such a limit is an unsolved problem , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , for measurements involving a fixed energy scale and finite volume , the number of relevant degrees of freedom is finite . under these conditions both",
    "the accessible volume and resolution are limited .",
    "truncated field theory that include degrees of freedom associated with this volume and resolution should describe physics on this scale after determining the parameters of the truncated theory by experiment .",
    "the predictions at this scale should be improvable as the volume and resolution are increased by finite amounts .",
    "this is independent of the existence of an infinite volume - infinite resolution limit that describes physical phenomena on all scales .    while it is possible to work at successively finer resolutions , there are reasons to eliminate short - distance degrees of freedom that are much smaller than the scales accessible to a given experiment . in this manner",
    "the effects of the eliminated degrees of freedom appear in a more complicated effective hamiltonian that only involves the physically relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the program initiated by glckle and mller to eliminate explicit pion degrees of freedom in a field theory of interacting pions and nucleons @xcite using an `` okobu '' transformation@xcite .",
    "a feature of the wavelet representation is that the commutation relations among the field operators are all discrete , and there are irreducible canonical pairs of operators associated with each resolution and volume .    in the wavelet representation",
    "truncated hamiltonians with different resolutions have the same form , with coefficients that are rescaled as a function of the resolution .",
    "there is a natural transformation that transforms the high - resolution truncated hamiltonian to the sum of the corresponding low - resolution truncated hamiltonian and corrections that involve the missing high - resolution degrees of freedom .",
    "block diagonalizing this hamiltonian according to resolution gives an effective hamiltonian entirely in the low - resolution degrees of freedom that includes the physics of the eliminated high - resolution degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be compared to the original low - resolution hamiltonian to see how it must be modified to include the effects of the eliminated degrees of freedom . in this representation",
    "explicit high - resolution degrees of freedom are replaced by more complicated effective interactions in the low - resolution degrees of freedom .",
    "while this process generates new effective operators , the coefficients of these operators are well - defined functions of the original parameters of the theory , so in a renormalizable theory there is no need to introduce new parameters associated with the new effective operators .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the use of flow equation methods @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite to perform the block diagonalization of the high - resolution hamiltonian .",
    "in general the flow equation will generate an infinite collection of complicated effective operators . in order to separate the problem of convergence of the flow equation from an analysis of the scaling properties of the effective interactions , we consider the case of a free field . for free fields the different resolution degrees of freedom",
    "are coupled by spatial derivatives , but the structure of the operators generated by the flow equation remain quadratic functions of the fields , which restricts the structure of the operators that are generated by the flow equation to a finite number of classes . because of this , the flow equation can be solved without addressing the problem of the generated effective interactions .",
    "this provides a first test of the proposed flow equation method to separate scales .",
    "in this section the basis of functions that will be used to expand the field operators are defined .",
    "the basis functions on the real line are daubechies scaling functions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite on a fixed scale and daubechies wavelets on all smaller scales .",
    "our preference for the daubechies basis is because the basis functions are orthonormal and have compact support .",
    "the scale is associated with the size of the support of different basis functions . in higher dimensions the basis functions are products of the one - dimensional basis functions defined in this section .",
    "this leads to a representation of the theory in terms of local observables .",
    "the structure of the truncated theory is similar to lattice truncations which are also formulated in terms of local degrees of freedom .",
    "one advantage of wavelet truncations is that it is possible to include independent degrees on different scales , so large - scale degrees of freedom do not have to be generated by the collective dynamics of many small - scale degrees of freedom .",
    "one useful property of the scaling - wavelet basis is that all of the basis functions can be constructed from a single function , @xmath0 , called the scaling function by integer translations and dyadic scale transformations .",
    "the scaling function , @xmath0 , is the solution of the following linear renormalization group equation    s(x ) = _ [ b.1 ] the normalization of the solution of this homogeneous equation is fixed by the condition s(x ) = 1 .",

    "the daubechies wavelets and scaling functions are fractal functions .",
    "this is because @xmath0 is the solution of a renormalization group equation , and all of the basis functions are obtained by applying a finite number of scale transformations , translations and sums to @xmath0 . in spite of their fractal nature , these basis functions have a finite number of derivatives that increase with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "this paper uses the @xmath6 basis .",
    "these basis functions have one continuous derivative which provides a means for computing derivatives of fields that appear in the hamiltonian without having to use finite difference approximations .",
    "increasing @xmath40 leads to more smoothness at the expense of larger support and increasing overlap with basis functions on the same scale .",
    "while quantum fields are generally assumed to be operator - valued tempered distributions , which suggest that field operators smeared with test functions that only have a finite number of derivatives might not be well - defined operators , direct calculations show that free field wightman functions smeared with the daubechies @xmath41 wavelet or scaling functions are well - defined .",
    "this is analogous to the observation that a delta function , which is a distribution , is also a well - defined linear functional on the space of continuous functions . equation ( [ b.6 ] ) shows that certain linear combinations of these functions can be much smoother .",
    "if there are any issues with the fractal nature of the wavelet basis functions they must arise when one tries to establish the existence of a local limit .    for theories truncated to a finite number of degrees of freedom , the interaction picture still exists , which makes it to possible to formulate the dynamics of the truncated theory in terms of the well - defined wavelet - smeared free fields on the free - field fock space .",
    "another potential issue with fractal basis functions involves their computation .",
    "this turns out to be a non - issue because they have compact support and integrals of products of these functions with polynomials of arbitrarily high - degree can be computed exactly ( reduced to finite linear algebra ) using the renormalization group equation ( [ b.1 ] ) .",
    "since any continuous function on a compact interval can be approximated by a polynomial , it is possible to accurately compute integrals of products of these basis functions with any continuous function .",
    "the renormalization group equation can also be used to reduce the computation of arbitrary products of these basis function and their derivatives to finite linear algebra .",
    "it is even possible to use these methods to evaluate integrals of products of these basis functions with functions having logarithmic or principal - value singularities @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "one can imagine integrating them out in a functional integral representation to get an effective theory involving only the experimentally relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a difficult calculation in the wavelet representation .",
    "a more direct approach would be to decouple the scaling function part of the hamiltonian from the wavelet part .",

    "the mass sets the energy scale for the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "the equation is solved using the euler method , which uses the differential equation to step to successive values of @xmath93 .",
    "we use a step size of .001 .",
    "this is determined by examining the size and number of matrix elements , to ensure that the errors remain small . while the error could be improved with a higher order solution method , in this example",
    "the euler method is sufficient to see the that flow equation drives the coupling term to zero .    to illustrate the evolution of the coefficients in the expansion ( [ t.3 ] ) we plot the hilbert - schmidt norms of the non - zero coefficients @xmath143 as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "there are four types of operators , @xmath144 and @xmath145 leading to 16 types of quadratic expressions .",
    "figures 1 - 8 show the hilbert - schmidt norms of the coefficients of each of the non - zero quadratic expressions as a function of the flow parameter .    the norms of coefficients involving all scaling or all wavelet fields evolve to non - zero values , while the norms of the coupling matrices all evolve to zero .",
    "the plots show that initially the size of the coupling terms fall off very fast , but the rate of decrease slows significantly as @xmath93 gets larger . for @xmath146 the hilbert schmidt norms of the coupling coefficients are reduced by about two orders of magnitude from their original values .",

    "the two narrow diagonal bands in in the bottom right corner of figure 9 represent the coefficients of @xmath158 for the scaling functions and wavelet fields respectively . the fatter diagonal bands in the upper left hand part of this figure are associated with the scale - scale and wavelet - wavelet derivative terms .",
    "they are almost diagonal because the matrices @xmath159 only couple neighboring degrees of freedom .",
    "the terms above and below the diagonal are the coefficients of the scale - wavelet and wavelet - scale derivative terms .",
    "these are responsible for the coupling of the two scales and are the terms that the flow equation is designed to suppress .",
    "figure 10 shows the value of these coefficients for @xmath155 . for this value of @xmath93",
    "the coupling terms have become smaller and more non - local .",
    "this is because repeated applications of the derivative matrix widens the support of the degrees of freedom that are coupled together .",
    "figure 11 shows that by @xmath156 the scale coupling terms have essentially disappeared .",
    "figure 12 show that solving the flow equation out to @xmath157 does not lead to any big changes .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior shown in figures 1 - 8 , that the exponential suppression slows as @xmath93 is increased .",
    "it is worth noting that the width of the diagonal band in the uncoupled hamiltonian at @xmath157 is about the same size as the width of the corresponding band in the original hamiltonian .",
    "this shows that at least for this example the flow equation preserves the local nature of the truncated theory .",
    "the figures support the contention that flow equation methods can be successfully applied to wavelet discretized field theory .    for any value of the flow parameter",
    "the flow equation generates a new equivalent hamiltonian . ignoring the small terms that couple the wavelet to the scaling function fields ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes a sum of two commuting operators that have degrees of freedom associated with different scale degrees of freedom , but each operator includes the effects of the eliminated degrees that appear in the other operator .",
    "it is still necessary to solve the field equations . in this case",
    "there are two independent systems of field equations using the decoupled hamiltonians : @xmath160    \\qquad \\dot{\\pi}(s , n , t ) = i [ h_s(\\lambda ) , { \\pi}(s , n , t)]\\ ] ] and @xmath161    \\qquad \\dot{\\pi}(w , n , t ) = i [ h_w(\\lambda ) , { \\pi}(w , n , t)]\\ ] ] the effective hamiltonian , @xmath162 , is the hamiltonian with the relevant ( scaling - function ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the diagonal part of @xmath162 is the hamiltonian for a finite system of uncoupled oscillators . since this system has a finite number of degrees of freedom , the ground state of this hamiltonian can be calculated in the fock space associated with the uncoupled oscillators .",
    "solutions of the heisenberg equations give the time dependence of the discrete field operators and can be used with the expansions ( [ f.11]-[f.12 ] ) to compute approximate spacetime correlation functions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to examine the use of flow equation methods to separate the physics on different resolution scales in an exact wavelet discretization of quantum field theory . while quantum field theory couples all distance scales , there is a physically relevant scale ( or resolution ) and it is desirable to formulate the theory directly in terms of the degrees of freedom associated with the physically relevant degrees of freedom",
    "this can be done by eliminating the short distance degrees of freedom .",
    "while it may not be possible to get a well - defined local theory by eliminating all arbitrarily small distance degrees of freedom , it is possible formulate an effective theory that includes the important short - distance physics by eliminating degrees of freedom between the physically relevant scale and a chosen minimal resolution scale .",
    "the justification for this is that for a given application there is a relevant volume and energy scale .",
    "these restrictions generally imply that the dynamics is dominated by a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be understood in a number of ways . for a free field theory restricting",
    "the energy leads to a subspace of the fock space with an upper bound on the number of particles .",
    "if this system is put in a finite volume , the free particles in a finite volume have discrete energies and only a finite number of these states have energy less than the energy scale .",
    "these degrees of freedom are sufficient to formulate the dynamics relevant to the system .    in the scaling - wavelet representation",
    "this provides a justification for a volume / resolution truncation of the field theory .",
    "the smallest scales that influence the physics that be eliminated by block diagonalizing the hamiltonian . in this representation",
    "the field was expressed as a linear combination of almost local operators classified by position and resolution .",
    "these operators satisfy simple discrete canonical commutation relations . in this representation",
    "the exact hamiltonian is a finite degree polynomial with known constant coefficients in an infinite number of these operators .",
    "resolution and volume truncations lead to truncated hamiltonians involving a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the approach taken in this paper differs from other wavelet approaches to quantum field theory@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the basis functions that are used in this work are orthonormal with compact support , but they have a limited amount of smoothness . in most wavelet approaches the wavelet functions are overcomplete , smooth functions that do not have compact support .",
    "the justification for smearing fields with functions that have a limited amount of smoothness is that when these basis functions are integrated against free field wightman functions the results are well - defined .",
    "this means the resulting operators are well defined on the free field fock space , and for theories truncated to a finite number of degrees of freedom it is not necessary to pass to an inequivalent representation of the field algebra in order to solve the field equations .",
    "while there are a number of potential methods to eliminate the short distance degrees of freedom , the simple nature of the commutation relations of the discrete field operators suggest using flow equation methods , where the generator of the desired unitary transformation involves commutators products of canonical pairs of operators .",
    "these methods have been proposed to be used in qcd@xcite@xcite as well as in potential theory@xcite .",
    "those applications focus on momentum scales and the equations are designed to drive the hamiltonian to a diagonal form . in this work",
    "the goal is to formulate the problem in terms of distance scales and to block diagonalize the hamiltonian rather than diagonalize it . in this example",
    "the transformed theory consists of two sets of canonically conjugate set of operators that operate on different distance scales .",
    "the generator of the flow equation is chosen to eliminate the terms that couple these scales in the hamiltonian .",
    "this method was tested using the hamiltonian for a free scalar field . while the free field is trivial , in the wavelet representation the space derivatives in the hamiltonian generate non - trivial terms that couple the degrees of freedom on different scales .",
    "this hamiltonain has the advantage that the flow equation applied to this hamiltonian does not generate an infinite number of new types of many - body operators .",
    "this allows us to focus on testing the flow equation as a method to separate scales without the complication of understanding the relative importance of the generated interactions .",
    "the method was applied to a free field hamiltonian with a volume and resolution truncation .",
    "the field expansions were limited to 32 basis functions that were associated with two different scales .",
    "rather than imposing boundary conditions , the exact expansion was simply truncated .",
    "the flow was generated by the commutator of the hamiltonian with the block diagonal part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the flow equation was solved by stepwise integration using the euler method .",
    "the dimensions were fixed by the mass in the free field hamiltonian which was taken as 1 and the daubechies k=3 wavelets and scaling functions were used to decompose the fields .",
    "the result is that the flow equation has the desired property of driving the scale - coupling terms to 0 , resulting in a transformed hamiltonian is that approximately the sum of mutually commuting high and low resolution hamiltonians .    in practice",
    "the coefficients of the coupling terms initially fell off quickly , but the rate of fall off slowed down significantly as the flow parameter increased .",
    "the method reduced the coupling coefficients by a factors of about 100 for a modest value of the flow parameter .    due to the local nature of the theory , the non - zero coefficients matrices of the field operators in the initial hamiltonian were in narrow bands . solving the flow equation did two things .",
    "first , as expected it eliminated the band associated the coefficients that couple fields on the different scales .",
    "second , to a good approximations it maintained the local structure of the theory .",
    "thus , while each euler iterations in principle generates more non - localities , and examination of figures 9 - 12 show that the generated non - local terms are significantly smaller than the generated local almost terms .",
    "initially we tried to solve these equations using perturbation theory .",
    "we found that it did not converge .",
    "we successfully solved the equation using the euler method , which is more like newton s method for differential equations .",
    "while higher order methods should converge faster , we found euler s method was sufficient for this truncation .    the next step in this program is to consider models with interactions and to consider models in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the complication with interactions is that the flow equation generates new operators with each step of the euler method .",
    "a different flow generator needs to be formulated to get results comparable to the results outlined above .",
    "this is because the analysis that led to ( [ feq.20]-[feq.21 ] ) does not apply to the interacting case . on the other hand",
    ", the truncations suggest that in the interacting case only a finite dimensional subspace of the fock space is relevant .",
    "flow equation methods are more naturally designed to work on subspaces and diagonalize or block diagonalize operators projected on subspaces .",
    "these projections limit the types and nature of the many - body operators that are generated by solving the flow equations .",
    "generalizations to 3 + 1 dimensions are straightforward .",
    "single basis functions are replaced by products of product of three basis functions .",
    "while the bookkeeping becomes more difficult , the basic structure is essentially unchanged .",
    "the authors would like to thank robert perry and mikhail altaisky for valuable feedback on this work .",

    "daubechies wavelets and scaling functions are fractal functions .",
    "integrals involving these functions can not be computed using conventional methods , however the scaling equation ( [ b.1 ] ) and normalization condition ( [ b.2 ] ) lead to linear constraints that reduce the exact integration of all of relevant integrals to finite linear algebra .",
