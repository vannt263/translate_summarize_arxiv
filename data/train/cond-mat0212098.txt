    "the _ landscape paradigm _ @xcite is based on the idea that the relevant behavior of a given interacting system can be understood by studying the general characteristics of the potential energy surface ( pes ) , i.e. the hypersurface defined by the potential energy as a function of the total configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "this way of looking at the dynamics in liquids has received in the last few years new attention due to computational improvement and new theoretical approaches . within the large variety of studies based on the pes characteristics @xcite it has recently pointed out the relevant role played by stationary points ( saddles ) of the pes in the analysis of the supercooled liquid regime of simple model liquids @xcite .",
    "the main result of the saddle - based approach has been the finding of a close relationship between the parameters describing the structural arrest and the saddles visited at a given temperature .",
    "more specifically , the saddle order ( fraction of negative curvatures -corresponding to negative eigenvalues of the hessian- at the saddle points ) turns out to have a well defined temperature dependence and extrapolates to zero at the mode - coupling temperature @xmath1 @xcite , where the inverse diffusion coefficient and the structural relaxation time appear to diverge as a power law .",
    "this result has been very useful to give a landscape - based interpretation of the dynamic critical temperature for the model liquids investigated : @xmath1 marks a crossover between a saddle - to - saddle dominated dynamics at `` high '' temperatures and a minimum - to - minimum dominated dynamics below @xmath1 . moreover , to further emphasize the role of the saddles in determining the slow dynamics in liquids , the temperature dependence of saddle order has been shown to be quantitatively related to that of diffusivity @xcite , allowing to give a simple interpretation of the relevant diffusive processes in terms of `` open '' directions in the @xmath2 dimensional configuration space .",
    "the analysis of saddles has also permitted to obtain important information about the shape of the landscape itself : it has been observed an high regularity in the distances among saddles and in their energy locations .",
    "this suggested a surprising simple organization of those points of the pes , i.e. the saddles , that are relevant for the description of the slow dynamics .",
    "the observed regularity allows us to introduce simplified models of the landscape reproducing some of the observed pes characteristics . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we explored the features of one of these simple models , the trigonometric model ( tm ) introduced by madan and keyes @xcite , made of @xmath3 independent sinusoidal degrees of freedom . despite its non - cooperative nature , the trigonometric model seems to capture many important features of the pes of simple liquids .    in this work",
    "we use the saddle - approach to analyze another model system that generalizes the tm introducing a cooperative interaction among the different degrees of freedom .",
    "more specifically , in the model studied here -that we call @xmath0-trigonometric model ( @xmath0tm)- there is a @xmath0-body mean field interaction .",
    "our aim is to extend the validity of the relationship between landscape ( saddle properties in our case ) and dynamic behavior , besides the model liquids investigated before , to systems where a cooperative behavior exists .",
    "the choice of the @xmath0tm has been motivated for two main reasons : it is a generalization of a simple liquid pes model , and it is a new model for testing in an analytical way the ideas underlying the landscape - dynamics relationship . indeed",
    "the thermodynamics of @xmath0tm , as the dynamics ( diffusion coefficient ) , and the saddles visited at a given temperature are analytically computable .",
    "this allows us to obtain directly a clear interpretation of the relationship between characteristics of the visited landscape and dynamics in a truly cooperative system , avoiding the computational problems usually encountered in the numerical analysis of pes in model liquids .",
    "the main results are : ( _ i ) _ we confirm the existence of a close relationship between saddle order and diffusivity : both have a similar temperature behavior , and approach an asymptotic arrhenius law at low temperature ; ( _ ii ) _ the energy barrier parameter observed in the arrhenius law of low temperature expansion of diffusivity is the mean elevation @xmath4 of saddles of order one from the minima , and this value grows linearly with the parameter @xmath0 governing the number of interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , our findings confirm the generality of the relationship between landscape ( saddle properties ) and dynamics , first observed numerically in simple liquids @xcite and analytically in spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section ii we introduce the model and its characteristics ; in section iii the thermodynamics is exactly solved , using a mean - field effective hamiltonian ; in section iv we explore the properties of saddles sampled by the system at different temperatures ; in section v the diffusion coefficient is determined through a langevin dynamics , and in section vi we report the conclusions .",
