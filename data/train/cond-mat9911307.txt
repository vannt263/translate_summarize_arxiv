    "the crystallographic structure @xmath15 of nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 is the simplest among the superconducting cuprates , each copper atom is coordinated to four oxygen atoms in a planar structure without apical oxygen .",
    "a nd@xmath16cuo@xmath17 crystal is the insulator with the valence band to be mainly of @xmath18 character and the empty conduction band to be the upper hubbard @xmath19 band .",
    "the coulomb @xmath20 repulsion on @xmath21 site @xmath22 is strong and it is larger than oxygen to metal charge - transfer energy @xmath23 . thus these cuprates are classified as the charge - transfer semiconductors .    the combination of @xmath24 doping and @xmath25 reduction results in the @xmath26-type conduction in the @xmath10 layers .",
    "the energy band structure calculation [ 1 ] shows that the fermi level is located in the band of @xmath27-type formed by @xmath28 orbitals of @xmath21 and @xmath29 orbitals of oxygen .",
    "the @xmath27  band appears to be of highly two - dimensional character with almost no dispersion in the normal to @xmath10 planes @xmath30-direction .",
    "the electrons are concentrated within the confines of conducting @xmath10 layers separated from each other by a distance @xmath31 .    due to the layered crystal structure",
    "the high - t@xmath32 copper oxide compounds are highly anisotropic in their normal state electical properties .",
    "the electron - doped systems nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 exhibit a very large anisotropy factor , @xmath33 [ 2,3 ] that is somewhat lower than in bi - systems ( @xmath34 ) but essentially higher than in la- and y - systems ( @xmath35 ) . for the underdoped and optimally doped compounds",
    "the @xmath36-axis resistivity , @xmath37 , is usually non - metallic ( @xmath38 ) at low enough temperatures [ 4 ] .",
    "in contrast to it , the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the resistivity in a @xmath10 plane , @xmath39 , are in general metallic near optimum doping",
    ".    a two - dimensional metallic state in a system with random disorder should exhibit weak localization of the charge carriers at low temperatures [ 5 ] .",
    "weak localization behaviour of the in - plane resistivity has been clearly observed and perfectly analysed for the bi@xmath16sr@xmath16cuo@xmath40 systems which were investigated with high precision at @xmath41 down to @xmath42 in normal and perpendicular to the @xmath10 planes magnetic fields up to @xmath43 [ 6 ] . as for la@xmath13sr@xmath14cuo@xmath4 or la@xmath13ba@xmath14cuo@xmath4 systems",
    ", a concentration range between the hopping regime at low @xmath44 and superconducting regime at @xmath45 seems to be so narrow that a well defined weak localization behaviour is difficult to observe [ 7,8 ] . only in the close proximity to @xmath46 nonsuperconducting sample la@xmath13ba@xmath14cuo@xmath4 [ 7 ] and superconducting sample la@xmath13sr@xmath14cuo@xmath4 ( @xmath47 ) in the fields @xmath48 display some signs of weak localization ( @xmath49-dependence of @xmath39 ) .",
    "due to their @xmath15 structure the @xmath50-systems should be particularly advantageous for the observation of @xmath0 effects in conduction process .",
    "really , there are several reports on the manifestation of @xmath0 weak localization in the in - plane conductance of nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 single crystals or films .",
    "thus a linear dependence of resistivity on @xmath51 comes about at @xmath52 for samples with @xmath53 , in which superconducting state is destroyed by a magnetic field [ 9 ] .",
    "furthermore , a highly anisotropic ( with regard to the magnetic field direction ) negative magnetoresistance , predicted for @xmath0 weak localization , has been observed in the nonsuperconducting state at low temperatures : in highly underdoped sample with @xmath54 [ 10 ] and in unreduced samples with @xmath55 [ 11 ] or @xmath56 [ 12 ] .",
    "measurements in superconducting @xmath57 sample with high @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) has shown a similar negative magnetoresistance in high ( up to @xmath60 ) transverse magnetic fields and an upturn in the normal state resistance as @xmath41 is lowered [ 11 ] .    in our previous investigation of the sample with @xmath61 ( @xmath62 )",
    "a negative magnetoresistance has been observed after the destruction of superconductivity by a magnetic field up to @xmath63 at @xmath64 [ 13 ] .",
    "we report here the results of measurements at much lower temperatures ( down to @xmath65 ) and in the higher _ dc _ magnetic fields ( up to @xmath66 ) .",
    "a drastic dependence of magnetoresistance magnitude on the direction of magnetic field is the most important experimental test for the @xmath0-character of a conducting system . for the investigation of the magnetoresistance anisotropy we have used here the measurements on nonsuperconducting sample with @xmath44 value ( @xmath67 ) which is close to the boundary value @xmath68 for the superconductivity in a nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 system",
    "high - quality single - phase nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 ( @xmath69 ) thin films have been produced by modificated lazer deposition technique with a flux separation [ 14 ] . the films with thickness around 5000  were deposited onto hot single crystal srtio@xmath16 substrate , which has ( 100 ) surface orientation .",
    "it was necessary to anneal the films subsequently in vacuum @xmath70 torr at 800@xmath71 during 40 min to form superconducting phase .",
    "the x - ray diffraction study has revealed the existence of the tetragonal phase only with @xmath36-axis perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "we report here the data for nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 films with @xmath72 and 0.18 only .",
    "the in - plane resistivity @xmath39 and hall coefficient @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) have been investigated in a single crystal superconducting film nd@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath4 ( @xmath75 ) at @xmath76 in a magnetic field up to @xmath77 . in the superconducting sample",
    "the normal state transport at low @xmath41 is hidden unless a magnetic field @xmath78 higher than the second critical field @xmath79 is applied ( for @xmath80 at @xmath81 ) .",
    "we have destroyed superconductivity by a magnetic field perpendicular to @xmath10 planes and observed a negative magnetoresistance in fields higher than @xmath79 ( fig.1 ) with logarithmic temperature dependence of the resistivity at @xmath82 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "fig.3 shows the results of measurements of the in - plane conductivity in non - superconducting sample nd@xmath2ce@xmath3cuo@xmath4 for perpendicular @xmath83 and parallel @xmath84 to the @xmath10 planes magnetic fields up to @xmath85 at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the logarithmic low temperature dependence of the conductivity is one of the indications of the interference quantum correction due to weak localization or electron - electron interaction in a two - dimensional system .",
    "magnetic field normal to the motion of a carrier destroys the interference leading to the localization . in @xmath0 system",
    "it causes negative magnetoresistance for the field perpendicular to the plane but no effect for the parallel configuration . in the @xmath0 weak localization theory the quantum correction to the drude surface conductivity in a perpendicular magnetic field",
    "is given by [ 15 ] : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a prefactor of the order of unity , @xmath90 is the digamma function , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "here @xmath93 is the phase coherence length ( @xmath94 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath95 is the phase breaking time ) and @xmath96 is the mean free path . at low temperature",
    "the inequality @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) is valid and thus the weak localization effects is almost totally supressed for @xmath99 .",
    "let us compare the equation for the transport field , presented in the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the elementary flux quantum , with the relation between the coherence length @xmath102 and the second critical field in the so called `` dirty '' limit ( @xmath103 ) : @xmath104 from eqs  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) one has @xmath105 and thus the inequality @xmath106 should be valid for any dirty superconductor .      from the experimental values of @xmath39 and hall constant @xmath73 in the normal state",
    "we have obtained the drude conductivity of a @xmath10 layer @xmath108 , the bulk @xmath109 and the surface @xmath110  electron densities ( @xmath111  is the distance between @xmath10 layers ) .",
    "we have @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath115 and @xmath116 . using the relation @xmath117 , with @xmath118 to be the fermi wave vector ,",
    "we have estimated the parameter @xmath119 .",
    "as @xmath120 a true metallic conduction in @xmath10 layers takes place .",
    "since @xmath121 we have found the mean free path @xmath122 and according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) the transport field @xmath123 . in the investigated sample the second critical field @xmath124 at @xmath81  [ 13 ] and",
    "@xmath125 at @xmath126 .",
    "thus we have @xmath106 and it occurs possible to observe the negative magnetoresistance owing to @xmath0 weak localization in the interval of magnetic fields @xmath127  ( fig.1a ) .    in the field range @xmath128 the expression ( 1 ) may be writen as @xmath129 fig.1b shows the surface conductivity @xmath130 as a function of @xmath131 .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath132 the experimental data can be described by simple formula ( 4 ) with prefactor @xmath89 as the only fitting parameter . at @xmath133",
    "we have @xmath134 but as the temperature is lowered the @xmath89  value becomes essentially more than unity : @xmath135 at @xmath136 .",
    "thus the effect of negative magnetoresistance at the lowest temperature is too large to be caused by the supression of weak localization only .",
    "in the case of effective electron attraction there exists the other orbital contribution to the negative magnetoresistance , namely , the contribution due to disorder - modified electron - electron interaction in the so called cooper channel ( the interaction of electrons with the opposite momenta ) [ 16 ] .",
    "the contribution such as that may be the reason of the extra effect of negative magnetoresistance in our _ in situ _ superconducting sample at very low temperatures .",
    "the magnitudes of the coefficient of @xmath131 in superconducting aluminium films at @xmath137 have been quantitatively explained just so [ 17 ] .    when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the @xmath138-plane , it turned out that the upper critical field , @xmath139 , is too high and is not reached in our sample with @xmath107 in a fields up to @xmath140 .",
    "this result is in accordance with the observation of a large anisotropy of @xmath79  for nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 single crystals with @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) [ 18 ] .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the dependence of magnetoresistance on the direction of magnetic field relative to @xmath10  plane , the study of _ in situ _ nonsuperconducting sample is needed .",
    "the positive magnetoconductivity ( negative magnetoresistance ) observed for this sample is obviously anisotropic relative to the direction of magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . from the fit of the curves @xmath144 by the functional form ( 1 ) ( solid curves in fig .",
    "3 ) we have found the inelastic scattering length @xmath145at @xmath146 and @xmath147  at @xmath81 .",
    "for the in - plane diffusion coefficient @xmath148 we have @xmath149 , so that @xmath150at @xmath146 and @xmath151at @xmath152 .",
    "these values are of the same order of magnitude as that obtained by hagen et al . for @xmath153 crystal ( @xmath154  at @xmath155 )",
    "[ 10 ] , but in contrast to their unusual @xmath156 dependence at @xmath157 our data at @xmath158 and @xmath115 are compatible with the @xmath159 dependence , predicted for the electron - electron inelastic scattering in a disordered @xmath0 system [ 19 ] .",
    "much more weak negative magnetoresistance for parallel configuration ( @xmath160 ) is quadratic in @xmath78 up to @xmath161 ( see solid curves in fig .  3 ) .",
    "it is of the same order of magnitude as that of hagen et al . at @xmath162 [ 10 ] or kussmaul et al . at @xmath163",
    "[ 11 ] but we havnt seen any sign of a positive kink at @xmath164 observed in [ 10 ] .",
    "longitudinal magnetoresistance in a strictly @xmath0 system may be caused only by the influence of the field on the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the most obvious reason for negative magnetoresistance is the scattering of electrons on some spin system : the system of @xmath21 spins or partially polarized @xmath50 spins . for any source of spin scattering",
    "the field scale for @xmath165 dependence ( @xmath166 ) is too low to explain our experimental data . for @xmath167 at @xmath168 and @xmath169 at @xmath81 , but we observe no deviations from @xmath165 dependence up to @xmath85 .    in standard theory of quantum interference effects in disordered conductors [ 20,21 ]",
    "the isotropic contribution to magnetoconductivity associated with spin degrees of freedom also takes place . when the zeeman energy of electrons @xmath170 exceeds @xmath171 , the magnetic field suppresses the contribution to conductivity originated from the part of electron - electron interaction thus leading to the effect of magnetoresistance",
    ". but this magnetoresistance is always positive and , with the value @xmath172 for the electronic @xmath173-factor , has the same characteristic field as that for spin scattering : @xmath174 .",
    "thus it apparenly is not related to the effect in question , but it may be a reason of positive kink on magnetoresistance curves of hagen et al .",
    "[ 10 ] .",
    "it is very important that in quasi - two - dimensional system with finite thickness @xmath175 there exists an orbital contribution to the longitudinal magnetoresistance .",
    "it is an ordinary explanation for the parabolic negative magnetoresistance observed in parallel configuration in semiconducting @xmath0 system : in @xmath176 heterostructures [ 22 ] or in silicon inversion layers [ 23 ] .",
    "the finite thickness correction to the strictly @xmath0 theory is defined by the expression [ 24 ] : @xmath177 } , \\label{eq : s_p}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 .",
    "it is seen from eq.(5 ) that @xmath179 should be quadratic in @xmath78 at fields @xmath180 with characteristic field @xmath181 .    for a preliminary estimation of @xmath182",
    "let us assume that @xmath183 ( @xmath184  is the distance between adjacent @xmath10 planes ) , then we have @xmath185  at  @xmath158 and @xmath186  at  @xmath81 .",
    "thus we think ( so as kussmaul et al .",
    "[ 11 ] ) that the finite thickness correction to the @xmath0 weak localization effect can reasonably explain the observed negative magnetoresistance for parallel configuration . as well as in parallel configuration there exists the finite thickness correction to the basic effect in perpendicular magnetic field ( see [ 20 ] , p.109 ) .",
    "we believe that it is just the reason of the upturn of experimental points for @xmath144  at @xmath187 in fig.3 . by fitting of the theoretical expression ( 5 ) to the curves for @xmath179 and taking into account the values of @xmath188 obtained earlier , we have found for the effective thickness of a conducting @xmath10 layer @xmath189 .",
    "the value of @xmath12 gives an estimate for the dimension of electron wave function in the normal to a @xmath10 plane direction and ensures the condition of a strong carrier confinement : @xmath183 .",
    "it is in accordance with the proposed highly @xmath0 character of the actual electron band of @xmath27-type with almost no dispersion along @xmath36-axis [ 1 ] .",
    "the x - ray investigations also show the concentration of electron density within the limits of @xmath190  above and below a @xmath21 atom in @xmath36-direction [ 25 ] .",
    "the single crystal ndcecuo may therefore be regarded as multi - quantum - well system ( @xmath191  wells / @xmath192   barriers ) or as an analog of multi - layered heterostructure . the theoretical description of high-@xmath58 superconductors as heterostructures has been recently proposed [ 26 ] .",
    "as the @xmath0-version of weak localization theory is able to describe the behaviour of @xmath193 in our sample , the inequality @xmath194 should be valid for the escape time of electron from one @xmath10 plane to another . the escape time between adjacent quantum wells in multilayered heterostructures can be estimated from the value of the normal diffusion constant , @xmath195 . for our sample",
    "we have the anisotropy factor @xmath196 and @xmath197 at @xmath198 .",
    "then @xmath199 even at room temperature so that the condition @xmath194 may be really fulfiled at low temperatures .",
