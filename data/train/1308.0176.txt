    "turbulent mixing originated at the interface between two layers of fluids of different densities in a gravitational field , i.e. rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability @xcite , is ubiquitous in nature and in many engineering applications",
    ". one can find it in heating of solar coronal @xcite , in buoyancy - driven mixing in the atmosphere and oceans , in cloud formation @xcite , and in inertial confinement fusion @xcite .",
    "in addition , rt turbulence has been pointed to as the dominant acceleration mechanism for thermonuclear flames in type - ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "other examples of rt instability can also be found in rotational fluids @xcite .",
    "although rt turbulence is of great importance and has been studied for many decades , there are still some open issues @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the past decade , many studies @xcite have focused on small - scale turbulent fluctuations in both two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) rt turbulence . in two dimensions , chertkov @xcite proposed a phenomenological theory . by assuming equipartition of the buoyancy and inertial forces at all scales in the inertial subrange for the energy equation , the model predicts a bolgiano - obukhov - like ( bo59 ) @xcite scaling for the cascades of both the velocity and temperature fields .",
    "this prediction was later confirmed from the view of structure functions by pioneering numerical simulations @xcite and was retrieved from the monin - yaglom relation by recent theoretical works @xcite .    in this paper , we want to deepen the previous studies @xcite by making a numerical simulation of rt turbulence in the 2d space . our objective is to study the time evolution and the scaling behavior of the global quantities and of small - scale turbulence properties .",
    "two considerations prompted us to focus on a 2d geometry .",
    "first , the numerical effort for 2d simulations is much smaller so that a good resolution becomes feasible for high reynolds / rayleigh numbers .",
    "second , in 2d rt turbulence , temperature behaves as an active scalar , leading to the emergence of a bo59 scaling .",
    "this is at clear variance with the 3d cases , where temperature is regarded as a passive scalar and thus the kolmogorov - like ( k41 ) phenomenology was predicted @xcite and observed @xcite .",
    "there is the attraction of studying the scaling properties in a turbulent system where a non - k41 phenomenology is expected .",
    "in addition , the bo59 scaling has long been believed to characterize the cascades of the velocity and temperature fluctuations in turbulent rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection . despite many years of experimental and numerical investigations ,",
    "whether the bo59 scaling exists in a turbulent rb system remains unsettled . for more detailed elucidation of the problem",
    ", we refer interested readers to the recent review paper by lohse @xmath9 xia @xcite .",
