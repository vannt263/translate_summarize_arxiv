    "spiral arms in barred galaxies have been explained in the past as density waves  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or spiral waves that result from the crowding of gas orbits  @xcite .",
    "@xcite invoked for the first time the need for chaotic orbits as building blocks of spirals near the end of the bar . in the  @xcite  models ,",
    "regular orbits dominate the main structure of the bar and the outermost portions of spiral arms .",
    "the inner portions of spiral arms are supported by chaotic orbits .",
    "recently it has been proposed that chaotic motion can support the spirals in barred - spiral systems .",
    "the new theory proposes that unstable lagrangian points ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) near the end of the bar are the sites where chaotic orbits are guided by invariant `` manifolds '' , and are the origin of spirals and ( inner and outer ) rings  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the spiral dynamics are coupled to the bar , and are driven by the manifolds .",
    "this approach has been studied by two different groups of people .",
    "one of those groups  @xcite , considers a continuous flow of orbits along the manifolds emanating from @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "when spirals form , stars move away from the corotation in a radial movement  @xcite , and material is needed to replenish the manifolds .",
    "one prediction of this `` manifold theory '' ( or `` lyapunov tube model '' ) , not accounted for in the density wave scenario , is that stronger bars should have more open spirals as compared to weaker bars , i.e. , the spiral arms pitch angle should increase with bar strength  @xcite .",
    "this kind of correlation was previously predicted by  @xcite , although for gas arms driven by a bar perturbation .",
    "another view of the `` invariant manifold theory ''  @xcite considers the locus of all points with initial conditions at the unstable manifolds that reach a local apocentric  ( or pericentric , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) passage , i.e. , the apsidal sections of the manifolds . in this scenario , there is no need for the replenishment of material to obtain long - lived spirals  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both views of the `` invariant manifold theory '' predict a trailing spiral pattern for strong perturbations and similar pattern speeds for the bar and spiral , i.e. , @xmath3 . however , in the view of  @xcite and  @xcite , the `` azimuthal tilt '' of the spiral response  @xcite , i.e. , the difference between the bar s major axis and the lagrangian points @xmath1 or @xmath2 at the moment of the onset of the spiral , determines how open the spiral arms will be . in this case , the pitch angles are smaller than the ones predicted by  @xcite and become even smaller for pure bar models when the `` azimuthal tilt '' is not taken into account ( c. efthymiopoulos , private communication 2011 ) .",
    "@xcite describe one more dynamical mechanism that supports spiral arms through stars in chaotic motion .",
    "they propose this mechanism by describing the spiral arms of the barred - spiral ngc 1300 .",
    "together with the bar , these spiral arms are inside the corotation and are not related to the presence of unstable lagrangian points and the associated families of periodic orbits .",
    "this alternative mechanism may be linked to some range of pitch angles of spiral arms encountered in barred - spiral systems .",
    "do manifolds drive spiral dynamics in barred galaxies ? or are the dynamics driven by the bar ?",
    "the bar may drive the dynamics , affecting the spiral amplitude locally , as reported by  @xcite  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and previously discarded ( or weakly corroborated ) by other authors comparing bar strength to spiral arm strength  @xcite .",
    "bars driving the dynamics would imply an accordance with ( linear ) density wave theory .",
    "these spirals may be a continuation of the bar mode , or an independent mode coupled to the bar  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the `` lyapunov tube model '' ,",
    "the strength of the bar affects the pitch angle of the spirals , but not its amplitude .",
    "the amplitude of the spirals depends on how much material is trapped by the manifolds , although , the amplitude of the spirals should in general decrease outward  @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the relation between the amplitude of the spirals with the pitch angle in non - barred and weakly barred galaxies .",
    "one prediction of the density wave theory  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see   [ denw_pred ] ) entails that different pitch angles are expected for spirals when observed in different bands ( e.g. , optical versus near - infrared [ nir ] ) . according to  @xcite ,",
    "the `` invariant manifold theory '' predicts that stars of different ages will be guided by the same manifold , and no difference between the winding of the spirals is expected .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate whether the predictions of pitch angles are observed for real galaxies , or not .",
    "two methods were applied for this purpose : the `` slope method '' ( section  [ sec_slope ] ) , which is especially good for determining how long the logarithmic shape is maintained for spiral arms , and the `` fourier method '' ( section  [ sec_fourier ] ) , which was used to determine the `` dominant '' pitch angle inside a given annulus for each object .",

    ", it was found that only 84 objects present spiral - like features .",
    "nevertheless , not all the objects are suitable for this kind of study due to asymmetries , e.g. , short , faint , or ragged spiral arms , or prominent rings .",
    "the following criteria were established in order to obtain a sample , including objects with a morphology candidate to be explained by `` chaotic '' spirals .    1 .",
    "the spiral arms must remain logarithmic , i.e. , with a constant pitch angle ( @xmath4 ) , at least for @xmath5 in the azimuthal range , @xmath6 . versus @xmath7 map .",
    "] this was verified with the `` slope method '' ( see  section  [ sec_slope ] ) .",
    "the lower limit value of @xmath6 was chosen according to figure 4 in  @xcite , where the manifold loci remain logarithmic ( for the adopted model parameters ) and maintain a `` nearly '' logarithmic geometry up to @xmath8 .",
    "we consider that the manifold loci and the density maximum along the spirals coincide .",
    "according to  @xcite , spirals supported by chaotic particles may extend up to @xmath9 radians .",

    "are present .",

    "the pitch angle definition as applied in this investigation only refers to spiral arms .",
    "a dependence of the inner ring shape on bar strength has been investigated by  @xcite .    after applying these selection criteria , the final sample consists of 27 barred spirals ( see , e.g. , table  [ tbl - qs ] ) .    in order to use the bar strength values of  (",

    "they were based on the osubgs @xmath14-band images that are deeper than @xmath15-band images .    to test the  @xcite predictions regarding spiral arms pitch angles",
    ", we use the nir @xmath15-band since we are interested in `` long''-lived structures rather than young stars , hii regions , or gas that would be present in optical data .",
    "[ bar_strength ]    the predicted trend in  athanassoula et al.s ( 2009a ) `` manifold models '' requires the strength of the bar at the radius of the lagrangian points @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "it should be mentioned that for these models the self - gravity of the spirals was not taken into account . on the other hand , the addition of the spiral potential in  tsoutsis et al.s ( 2009 ) models shifts the positions of the lagrangian points @xmath1 or @xmath2 both in the radial and azimuthal directions .",
    "the strength of the bar can be obtained from the  @xcite radial profiles of the perturbation strength .",

    "there have been significant discussions on the validity of this method .",
    "this is partly because  @xcite found some cases ( e.g. , ngc 4665 ) where @xmath23 , i.e. , corotation before the end of the bar .",
    "according to  @xcite , self - consistent bars are not possible to be modeled in this regime .",

    "<S> according to one version of the recently proposed `` manifold '' theory that explains the origin of spirals and rings in relation to chaotic orbits , galaxies with stronger bars should have a higher spiral arms pitch angle when compared to galaxies with weaker bars . a sub - sample of barred - spiral galaxies in the ohio state university bright galaxy survey , </S>",
    "<S> was used to analyze the spiral arms pitch angle . </S>",
    "<S> these were compared with bar strengths taken from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the galaxies in which the spiral arms maintain a logarithmic shape for more than 70@xmath0 seem to corroborate the predicted trend . </S>"
