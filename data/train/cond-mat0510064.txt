    "the year 2005 marks the centenary of the publication of three remarkable papers by einstein , one on brownian motion  @xcite , one on special relativity  @xcite , and the other one on the photoelectric effect and light quanta  @xcite .",
    "each of them made a revolution on its own .",
    "in particular , his paper on brownian motion ( along with the related work by smoluchowsky  @xcite and langevin  @xcite ) had a more sustained and broader impact , not just in traditional ` natural ' sciences such as physics , astronomy , chemistry , biology and mathematics but even in ` man - made ' subjects such as economics and computer science .",
    "the range of applications of einstein s brownian motion and his theory of diffusion is truely remarkable .",
    "the ever emerging new applications in diverse fields have made the brownian motion a true legacy and a great gift of einstein to science .",
    "there have been numerous articles in the past detailing the history of brownian motion prior to and after einstein .",
    "reviewing this gigantic amount of work is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "this year two excellent reviews on the brownian motion with its history and applications have been published , one by frey and kroy  @xcite and the other by duplantier  @xcite .",
    "the former discusses the applications of brownian motion in soft matter and biological physics and the latter , after a very nice historical review , discusses the applications of brownian motion in a variety of two dimensional growth problems and their connections to the conformal field theory .",
    "apart from these two reviews , there have been numerous other recent reviews on the 100 years of brownian motion  @xcite  it is simply not possible to cite all of them within the limited scope of this article and i apologise for that . the purpose of the present article is to discuss some complementary aspects of brownian motion that are not covered by the recent reviews mentioned above .    after a brief introduction to einstein s original derivation of the stokes - einstein relation and the diffusion equation in section",
    "ii , the principal focus of the rest of the article will be on the statistical properties of functionals of one dimensional brownian motion , with special emphasis on their applications in physics and computer science .",
    "if @xmath0 represents a brownian motion , a brownian functional over a fixed time interval @xmath1 $ ] is simply defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is some prescribed arbitrary function . for each realization of the brownian path",
    ", the quantity @xmath4 has a different value and one is interested in the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath4 .",
    "it was kac who first realized  @xcite that the statistical properties of one dimensional brownian functionals can be studied by cleverly using the path integral method devised by feynman in his unpublished ph.d thesis at princeton .",
    "this observation of kac thus took einstein s classical diffusion process into yet another completely different domain of physics namely the quantum mechanics and led to the discovery of the celebrated feynman - kac formula .",
    "since then brownian functionals have found numerous applications in diverse fields ranging from probability theory  @xcite and finance  @xcite to disordered systems and mesocopic physics  @xcite . in this article",
    "i will discuss some of them , along with some recent applications of brownian functionals in computer science .",
    "after a brief and pedagogical derivation of the path integral methods leading to the feynman - kac formula in sections iii , i will discuss several applications from physics , computer science and graph theory in section iv . in section",
    "v , the statistical properties of  first - passage brownian functionals \" will be discusssed . a first - passage functional",
    "is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the first - passage time of the brownian process @xmath0 ,",
    "i.e. the first time the process crosses zero .",
    "such first - passage functionals have many applications , e.g. in the distribution of lifetimes of comets , in queueing theory and also in transport properties in disordered systems .",
    "some of these applications will be discussed in section v.    the diverse and ever emerging new applications of brownian functionals briefly presented here will hopefully convince the reader that ` brownian functionalogy ' merits the status of a subfield of statistical physics ( and stochastic calculus ) itself and is certainly a part of the legacy that einstein left behind .",
    "einstein s 1905 paper on brownian motion  @xcite achieved two important milestones : ( i ) to relate macroscopic kinetic parameters such as the diffusion constant and friction coefficient to the correlation functions characterizing fluctuations of microscopic variables  known as a fluctuation - dissipation relation and ( ii ) to provide a derivation of the celebrated diffusion equation starting from the microscopic irregular motion of a particle  thus laying the foundation of the important field of  stochastic processes \" .      very briefly ,",
    "einstein s argument leading to the derivation of fluctuation - dissipation relation goes as follows .",
    "imagine a dilute gas of noninteracting brownian particles in a solvent under a constant volume force @xmath7 ( such as gravity ) on each particle . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a one dimensional system here , though the arguments can be generalized straightforwardly to higher dimensions .",
    "there are two steps to the argument .",
    "the first step is to assume that the dilute gas of brownian particles suspended in a solvent behaves as an ideal gas and hence exerts an osmotic pressure on the container giving rise to a pressure field .",
    "the pressure @xmath8 at point @xmath9 is related to the density @xmath10 via the equation of state for an ideal gas : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath4 is the temperature .",
    "the force per unit volume due to the pressure field @xmath13 must be balanced at equilibrium by the net external force density @xmath14 , leading to the force balance condition : @xmath15 .",
    "the solution is simply @xmath16    the next step of the argument consists of identifying two currents in the system .",
    "the first is the diffusion current @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined as the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the second is the drift current due to the external force , @xmath19 which can be computed as follows . under a constant external force ,",
    "each particle achieves at long times a terminal drift velocity , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the friction coefficient . for spherical particles of radius @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath21 is given by the stoke s formula , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the viscosity .",
    "thus , @xmath25 .",
    "now , at equilibrium , the net current in a closed system must be zero , @xmath26 leading to the equation @xmath27 .",
    "the solution is @xmath28 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) einstein obtained the important relation @xmath29 which is known today as the stokes - einstein relation that connects macroscopic kinetic coefficients such as @xmath18 and @xmath21 to the thermal fluctuations characterized by the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to the fluctuation - dissipation relation in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , einstein s 1905 paper on brownian motion also provided an elegant derivation of the diffusion equation that expressed the diffusion constant @xmath18 in terms of microscopic fluctuations .",
    "since the particles are independent , the density @xmath30 can also be interpreted as the probability @xmath31 that a single brownian particle is at position @xmath9 at time @xmath32 and the aim is to derive an evolution equation for @xmath33 by following the trajectory of a single particle . here",
    "one assumes that the particle is free , i.e. not subjected to any external drift .",
    "einstein considered the particle at position @xmath9 at time @xmath32 and asssumed that in a microscopic time step @xmath34 , the particle jumps by a random amount @xmath35 which is thus a stochastic variable .",
    "he then wrote down an evolution equation for @xmath33 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the normalized probability density of the ` jump ' @xmath35 in time step @xmath34 .",
    "this evolution equation is known today as the chapman - kolmogorov equation and it inherently assumes that the stochastic process @xmath38 is markovian .",
    "this means that the jump variables @xmath35 s are independent from step to step , so that the position @xmath38 of the particle at a given time step depends only on its previous time step and not on the full previous history of evolution .",
    "next einstein assumed that @xmath39 in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ diff1 ] ) can be taylor expanded assuming ` small ' @xmath35 .",
    "this gives @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-th moment of the jump variable @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the absence of external drift sets @xmath43 . dividing both sides of eq .",
    "( [ diff2 ] ) by @xmath34 , taking the limit @xmath44 and keeping only the leading nonzero term ( assuming the higher order terms vanish as @xmath44 ) one gets the diffusion equation @xmath45 where the diffusion constant @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average of the square of the microscopic displacement in a microscopic time step @xmath34 .",
    "thus einstein was able to express the constant @xmath18 that appears as a coefficient in the macrosopic diffusion current @xmath48 in terms of the microscopic fluctuation @xmath35 in the position of a brownian particle .",
    "this derivation also brings out the fundamental principle of the diffusion process , i.e. the length scale must scale as the square root of the time scale .    the position of the brownian particle can evolve via many possible ` stochastic ' trajectories . the diffusion equation ( [ diff3 ] ) describing the evolution of the probability density sums up the effects of all underlying stochastic trajectories .",
    "however , it is often useful to have a mathematical description of each single trajectory .",
    "this brings us to the description of the diffusion process  la langevin@xcite .",
    "it is clear from einstein s derivation that the local slope of an evolving trajectory at time @xmath32 can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a random ` noise ' which is independent from one microscopic step to another , and it has zero mean .",
    "its variance at a given time @xmath32 , in the continuum limit @xmath51 , can also be computed from eq .",
    "( [ diff4 ] ) .",
    "one gets @xmath52 as @xmath51 .",
    "thus the noise term typically scales as @xmath53 as @xmath51 .",
    "the correlation function of the noise between two different times can then be written as , @xmath54 in the continuum limit @xmath44 , the noise @xmath50 then tends to a limiting noise @xmath55 which has zero mean and a correlator , @xmath56 .",
    "this last result follows by formally taking the limit @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) where , loosely speaking , one replaces the @xmath57 by @xmath58 .",
    "such a noise is called a ` white ' noise .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ slope1 ] ) reduces to the celebrated langevin equation , @xmath59 where @xmath55 is a white noise .",
    "moreover , in the continuum limit @xmath51 , one can assume , without any loss of generality , that the white noise @xmath55 is gaussian .",
    "this means that the joint probability distribution of a particular history of the noise variables @xmath60 $ ] can be written as @xmath61 \\propto \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{4d}\\int_0^{t }   \\xi^2(\\tau ) d\\tau\\right ] .",
    "\\label{pi0}\\ ] ] we will see later that this particular fact plays the key role in the representation of brownian motion as a path integral .",
    "the brownian motion @xmath38 can thus be represented as the integrated white noise , @xmath62 . while the physicists call this a brownian motion , the mathematicians call this integrated white noise the wiener process , named after the mathematician n. wiener .    langevin s formulation in eq .",
    "( [ lange1 ] ) also makes a correspondence between brownian motion and the random walk problem where the position @xmath63 of a random walker after @xmath64 steps evolves via @xmath65 where @xmath66 s are independent random variables , each drawn from the common distribution @xmath67 for each step @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the idea of understanding brownian motion in terms of random walks was first conceived by smoluchowsky  @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation representation of brownian motion makes this connection evident , the brownian motion is just the suitably taken continuum limit of the random walk problem . for large @xmath64 , by virtue of the central limit theorem , the results for the random walk problem reduce to those of the brownian motion .",
    "this is an important point because in many applications , especially those in computer science as will be discussed later , one often encounters discrete random walks as in eq .",
    "( [ rw1 ] ) which are often more difficult to solve than the continuum brownian motion .",
    "however , since in most applications one is typically interested in the large time scaling - limit results , one can correctly approximate a discrete random walk sequence by the continuum brownian process and this makes life much simpler .",
    "the solution of the diffusion equation ( [ diff3 ] ) can be easily obtained in free space by the fourier transform method . for simplicity , we set @xmath68 for the rest of the article .",
    "one gets @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the initial condition and the diffusion propagator @xmath71 \\label{green1}\\ ] ] denotes the conditional probability that the brownian particle reaches @xmath9 at time @xmath32 , starting from @xmath72 at @xmath73 .",
    "it was m. kac who first made the important observation  @xcite that this diffusion propagator can be interpreted , using feynman s path integral formalism , as the quantum propagator of a free particle from time @xmath74 to time @xmath32 .",
    "this is easy to see . using the property of the gaussian noise in eq .",
    "( [ pi0 ] ) and the langevin equation ( [ lange1 ] ) , it is clear that the probability of any path @xmath75 can be written as @xmath76\\propto \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int_0^{t } \\left(\\frac{dx}{d\\tau}\\right)^2\\ , d\\tau\\right ] .",
    "\\label{pi1}\\ ] ] thus the diffusion propagator , i.e. the probability that a path goes from @xmath72 at @xmath73 to @xmath9 at @xmath32 can be written as a sum of over the contributions from all possible paths propagating from @xmath72 at @xmath77 to @xmath9 at @xmath78 .",
    "this sum is indeed feynman s path integral  @xcite @xmath79 . \\label{prop0}\\ ] ] one immediately identifies the term @xmath80 as the classical kinetic energy of a particle of unit mass and the integral @xmath81 as the lagrangian of a free particle of unit mass .",
    "following feynman@xcite , one then identifies the path integral in eq .",
    "( [ prop0 ] ) as a quantum propagator @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the quantum hamiltonian of a free particle ( we have set the mass @xmath84 and the planck s constant @xmath85 ) . to make the connection complete , the quantum propagator on the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ prop1 ] ) can be easily evaluated by expanding it in the free particle eigenbasis . noting that @xmath86 has free particle eigenfunctions @xmath87 with eigenvalue @xmath88 , one gets @xmath89 performing the gaussian integration , one gets back the classical result in eq .",
    "( [ green1 ] ) that was obtained by solving the diffusion equation .",
    "thus the two approaches , one by solving a partial differential equation usually referred to as the fokker - planck approach and the other using the path integral method are completely equivalent .",
    "one may argue that once the basic propagator is known , the brownian motion is well understood and there is nothing else interesting left to study !",
    "this is simply not true because there are intricate questions associated with the diffusion process that are often rather nontrivial .",
    "a notable nontrivial example is the calculation of the persistence exponent associated with a diffusion process  @xcite .",
    "consider a diffusive field @xmath90 evolving via the @xmath91-dimensional diffusion equation @xmath92 starting from the initial condition @xmath93 which is a random gaussian field , uncorrelated in space .",
    "the solution at time @xmath32 can be easily found using @xmath91-dimensional trivial generalization of the diffusion propagator in eq .",
    "( [ green1 ] ) @xmath94 . \\label{dpers2}\\ ] ] now , suppose that we fix a point @xmath95 in space and monitor the field @xmath90 there as a function of time @xmath32 and ask : what is the probability @xmath96 that the field @xmath90 at @xmath95 does not change sign up to time @xmath32 starting initially at the random value @xmath93 ? by translational invariance , @xmath96 does not depend on the position @xmath95 .",
    "this probability @xmath96 is called the persistence probability that has generated a lot of interest over the last decade in the context of nonequilibrium systems  @xcite . for the simple diffusion process in eq .",
    "( [ dpers2 ] ) , it is known , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite that at late times @xmath32 , the persistence @xmath96 has a power law tail @xmath97 where the persistence exponent @xmath98 is nontrivial ( even in one dimension ! ) , e.g. , @xmath99 in @xmath100 , @xmath101 in @xmath102 , @xmath103 in @xmath104 etc . while this exponent @xmath98 is known numerically very precisely and also very accurately by approximate analytical methods@xcite , an exact calculation of @xmath98 has not yet been achieved and it remains as an outstanding unsolved problem for the diffusion process  @xcite . this example",
    "thus clarifies that while the knowledge of the diffusion propagator is necessary , it is by no means sufficient to answer more detailed history related questions associated with the diffusion process .",
    "note that in the persistence problem discussed above , the relevant stochastic process at a fixed point @xmath95 in space , whose properties one is interested in , is actually a more complex non - markovian process  @xcite even though it originated from a simple diffusion equation . in this article , we will stay with our simple brownian motion in eq .",
    "( [ lange1 ] ) which is a markov process and discuss some of the nontrivial aspects of this simple brownian motion .",
    "for example , in many applications of brownian motion in physics , finance and computer science , the relevant brownian process is often constrained .",
    "for example , an important issue is the first - passage property of a brownian motion  @xcite , i.e. the distribution of the first time that a brownian process crosses the origin ?",
    "for this , one needs to sample only a subset of all possible brownian paths that do not cross the origin up to a certain time .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing the constraint of no crossing on a brownian path .",
    "apart from the constrained brownian motion , some other applications require a knowledge of the statistical properties of a brownian functional up to time @xmath32 , defined as @xmath105 , where @xmath3 is a specified function .",
    "we will provide several examples later and will see that while the properties of a free brownian motion are rather simple and are essentially encoded in its propagator in eq .",
    "( [ green1 ] ) , properties of constrained brownian motion or that of a brownian functional are often nontrivial to derive and the path integral technique discussed above is particularly suitable to address some of these issues .      as a simple example of a constrained brownian motion , we calculate in this subsection the first - passage probability density @xmath106 .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 is simply the probability that a brownian path , starting at @xmath72 at @xmath73 , will cross the origin for the first time between time @xmath32 and @xmath108 . clearly , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the probability that the path starting at @xmath72 at @xmath73 does not cross the origin up to @xmath32 .",
    "the probability @xmath110 can be easily expressed in terms of a path integral @xmath111\\ , \\prod_{\\tau=0}^{t } \\theta\\left[x(\\tau)\\right ] \\label{fp1}\\ ] ] where the paths propagate from the initial position @xmath112 to the final position @xmath9 at time @xmath32 and then we integrate @xmath9 over only the positive half - space since the final position @xmath9 can only be positive .",
    "the term @xmath113 $ ] inside the path integral is an indicator function that enforces the constraint that the path stays above the origin up to @xmath32 .",
    "we then identify the path integral in eq .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) as an integral over a quantum propagator , @xmath114 where the hamiltonian @xmath115 with the quantum potential @xmath116 if @xmath117 and @xmath118 if @xmath119 .",

    "the eigenfunction of @xmath120 must vanish at @xmath121 , but for @xmath117 it corresponds to that of a free particle .",
    "the correctly normalized eigenfunctions are thus @xmath122 with @xmath123 with eigenvalues @xmath88 .",
    "the quantum propagator can then be evaluated again by decomposing into the eigenbasis @xmath124 . \\label{fp3}\\ ] ] note that this result for the propagator can also be derived alternately by solving the diffusion equation with an absorbing boundary condition at the origin .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ fp3 ] ) then follows by a simple application of the image method  @xcite .",
    "integrating over the final position in @xmath9 one gets from eq .",
    "( [ fp2 ] ) the classical result  @xcite , @xmath125 where @xmath126 . the first - passage probability density is then given by @xmath127 for @xmath128 , one thus recovers the well known @xmath129 decay of the first - passage probability  @xcite density .",
    "in this subsection we will discuss how to calculate the statistical properties of a brownian functional defined as @xmath130 where @xmath0 is a brownian path starting from @xmath72 at @xmath77 and propagating up to time @xmath78 and @xmath3 is a specified function . clearly @xmath4 is random variable taking different values for different brownian paths .",
    "the goal is to calculate its probability distribution @xmath131 .",
    "the choice of @xmath3 depends on which quantity we want to calculate .",
    "brownian functionals appear in a wide range of problems across different fields ranging from probability theory , finance , data analysis , disordered systems , and computer science .",
    "we consider a few examples below .    1 .   in probability theory ,",
    "an important object of interest is the occupation time , i.e. the time spent by a brownian motion above the origin within a time window of size @xmath32  @xcite .",

    "the total time @xmath32 is just the size of a linear box in which the particle is moving .",
    "thus @xmath147 is just the partition function of the particle in a random potential  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the exponential of a brownian motion also appears in the expression for the wigner time delay in one dimensional quantum scattering process by a random potential  @xcite .",
