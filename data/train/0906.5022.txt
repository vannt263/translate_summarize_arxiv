    "nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize health care  @xcite . a current example is enhanced imaging with nanoscale particles  @xcite .",
    "future possibilities include programmable machines comparable in size to cells  @xcite .",
    "such microscopic robots ( `` nanorobots '' ) could provide significant medical benefits  @xcite .    realizing these benefits requires fabricating the robots cheaply and in large numbers .",
    "such fabrication is beyond current technology , but could result from ongoing progress in developing nanoscale devices .",
    "one approach is engineering biological systems , e.g. , rna - based logic inside cells  @xcite and bacteria attached to nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "however , biological organisms have limited material properties and computational speed . instead , we consider machines based on plausible extensions of currently demonstrated nanoscale electronics , sensors and motors  @xcite and relying on directed assembly  @xcite .",
    "these components enable nonbiological robots that are stronger , faster and more flexibly programmed than is possible with biological organisms .",
    "a major challenge for nanorobots arises from the physics of their microenvironments , which differ in several significant respects from today s larger robots .",
    "first , the robots will often operate in fluids containing many moving objects , such as cells , dominated by viscous forces .",
    "second , thermal noise is a significant source of sensor error and brownian motion limits the ability to follow precisely specified paths .",
    "finally , power significantly constrains the robots  @xcite , especially for long - term applications where robots may passively monitor for specific rare conditions ( e.g. , injury or infection ) and must respond rapidly when those conditions occur .",
    "individual robots moving passively with the circulation can approach within a few cell diameters of most tissue cells of the body . to enable passing through even the smallest vessels ,",
    "the robots must be at most a few microns in diameter .",
    "this small size limits the capabilities of individual robots . for tasks requiring greater capabilities",
    ", robots could form aggregates by using self - assembly protocols  @xcite . for robots reaching tissues through the circulation ,",
    "the simplest aggregates are formed on the inner wall of the vessel .",
    "robots could also aggregate in tissue spaces outside small blood vessels by exiting capillaries via diapedesis  @xcite , a process similar to that used by immune cells  @xcite .",
    "aggregates of robots in one location for an extended period of time could be useful in a variety of tasks .",
    "for example , they could improve diagnosis by combining multiple measurements of chemicals  @xcite . using these measurements",
    ", the aggregate could give precise temporal and spatial control of drug release  @xcite as an extension of an _ in vitro _ demonstration using dna computers  @xcite .",
    "using chemical signals , the robots could affect behavior of nearby tissue cells .",
    "for such communication , molecules on the robot s surface could mimic existing signalling molecules to bind to receptors on the cell surface  @xcite .",
    "examples include activating nerve cells  @xcite and initiating immune response  @xcite , which could in turn amplify the actions of robots by recruiting cells to aid in the treatment .",
    "such actions would be a small - scale analog of robots affecting self - organized behavior of groups of organisms  @xcite .",
    "aggregates could also monitor processes that take place over long periods of time , such as electrical activity ( e.g. , from nearby nerve cells ) , thereby extending capabilities of devices tethered to nanowires introduced through the circulatory system  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the robots will likely need to remain on station for tens of minutes to a few hours or even longer",
    ".    the aggregate itself could be part of the treatment by providing structural support , e.g. , in rapid response to injured blood vessels  @xcite .",
    "aggregates could perform precise microsurgery at the scale of individual cells , extending surgical capabilities of simpler nanoscale devices  @xcite .",
    "since biological processes often involve activities at molecular , cell , tissue and organ levels , such microsurgery could complement conventional surgery at larger scales .",
    "for instance , a few millimeter - scale manipulators , built from micromachine ( mems ) technology , and a population of microscopic devices could act simultaneously at tissue and cellular size scales , e.g. , for nerve repair  @xcite .    for medical tasks of limited duration",
    ", onboard fuel created during robot manufacture could suffice . otherwise , the robots need energy drawn from their environment , such as converting externally generated vibrations to electricity  @xcite or chemical generators  @xcite .",
    "power and a coarse level of control can be combined by using an external source , e.g. , light , to activate chemicals in the fluid to power the machines in specific locations  @xcite , similar to nanoparticle activation during photodynamic therapy  @xcite , or by using localized thermal , acoustic or chemical demarcation  @xcite .",
    "this paper examines generating power for long - term robot activity from reacting glucose and oxygen , which are both available in the blood .",
    "such a power source is analogous to bacteria - based fuel cells whose enzymes enable full oxidation of glucose  @xcite .",
    "we describe a computationally feasible model incorporating aspects of microenvironments with significant effect on robot performance but not previously considered in robot designs , e.g. , kinetic time constants determining how rapidly chemical concentrations adjust to robot operations . as a specific scenario , we focus on modest numbers of robots aggregated in capillaries .",
    "a second question we consider is how the robots affect surrounding tissue .",
    "locally , the robots compete for oxygen with the tissue and also physically block diffusion out of the capillary . robot power generation results in waste heat , which could locally heat the tissue",
    "the robot oxygen consumption could also have longer range effects by depleting oxygen carried in passing red blood cells .    in the remainder of this paper , we present a model of the key physical properties relevant to power generation for robots using oxygen and glucose in the blood plasma . using this model , we then evaluate the steady - state power generation capabilities of aggregated robots and how they influence surrounding tissue .",
    "[ sect.model ]    we consider microscopic robots using oxygen and glucose available in blood plasma as the robots power source .",
    "this scenario involves fluid flow , chemical diffusion , power generation from reacting chemicals and waste heat production . except for the simplest geometries ,",
    "behaviors must be computed numerically , e.g. , via the finite element method  @xcite .",
    "computational feasibility requires a choice between level of detail of modeling individual devices and the scale of the simulation , both in number of devices and physical size of the environment considered . for microscopic biological environments relevant for nanorobots ,",
    "detailed physical properties may not be known or measurable with current technology , thereby limiting the level of detail possible to specify .",
    "this section describes our model .",
    "the simplifying approximations are similar to those used in biophysical models of microscopic environments , such as oxygen transport in small blood vessels with diffusion into surrounding tissue  @xcite .",
    "we focus on steady - state behavior indicating long - term robot performance when averaged over short - term changes in the local environment such as individual blood cells ( exclusively erythrocytes , not white cells or platelets unless noted otherwise ) passing the robots .",

    "[ fig.oxygen concentration ] shows the distribution of oxygen in the tissue and plasma in the vessel near the robots .",
    "the robots reduce the local oxygen concentration far more than the surrounding tissue , as seen by comparing with the vessel without robots .",
    "most of the extra oxygen used by the robots comes from the passing blood cells , which have about 100 times the oxygen concentration of the plasma . within the vessel with the robots , the concentration in the plasma is lowest in the fluid next to the robots .",
    "downstream of the robots is a recovery region where the concentration increases a bit as cells respond to the abruptly lowered concentration near the robots . in the low demand scenario ,",
    "the concentration in the vessel just downstream of the robots is somewhat lower than in the surrounding tissue .",
    "thus in this region , the net movement of oxygen is from the tissue into the vessel , where the fluid motion transports the oxygen somewhat downstream before it diffuses back into the tissue . in effect",
    ", part of the oxygen entering the vessel travels through the tissue around robots to the downstream section of the vessel , in contrast to the pattern without robots where oxygen is always moving from the vessel into the surrounding tissue .",

    "[ fig.co2 section ] gives another view of how the robots affect the oxygen concentration in the surrounding tissue .",
    "the concentration is zero at the robot surface facing into the vessel .",
    "the robots decrease the oxygen concentration somewhat but do not affect tissue power generation much since the concentration remains well above the threshold where power generation drops significantly , i.e. , @xmath2 given in table  [ table.parameters ] .",
    "however , at large distances from the vessel in the high demand scenario oxygen concentration is low enough to significantly decrease tissue power production .",
    "this low level of oxygen also occurs when there are no robots .",
    "[ fig.co2 section ] includes comparison with the simpler krogh model of oxygen transport to tissue from vessels without robots  @xcite .",
    "the krogh model assumes constant power density in the tissue and no diffusion along the vessel direction in the tissue . for the low demand scenario ,",
    "the krogh model results are close to those from our model .",
    "however in the high demand case , the krogh model has oxygen concentration drop to zero about @xmath1 from the vessel , due to the unrealistic assumption of constant power use rather than the decrease in power use at low concentrations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.tissue reaction rate ] ) .",
    "oxygen flux to the robots ranges from about @xmath3 to @xmath4 with the zero - concentration boundary condition .",
    "estimates of pump capabilities are up to @xmath5  @xcite , which is more than 100 times the actual flux to the robots .",
    "such pumps could thereby maintain the zero concentration boundary condition . at an energy use of @xmath6  @xcite",
    ", the pumps would require about @xmath7 per robot to handle the incoming flux , slightly reducing the power benefit of the pumps .",
    "however , much of this pumping energy may be recoverable by adding a generator using the subsequent expansion of the reaction products to their lower partial pressure outside the robot  @xcite .",
    "this section describes the steady - state power available to the robots according to our model in various scenarios .",
    "we first discuss the average per robot power in the aggregate , for both high and low capacity cases , which also indicates the total power available to the aggregate as a whole .",
    "we then show how the power is distributed among the robots , based on their location in the ringset .",
    "finally , we illustrate the qualitative features of these results in a simpler , analytically - solvable model to identify key scaling relationships between robot design choices and power availability .",

    "the less than 2-fold decrease in robot power generation in the face of a larger 2.5-fold decrease in @xmath14  inlet concentration from the arterial to the venous end of the capillary shows that robots extract more oxygen from red cells than these cells would normally release while passing the length of the vessel .",
    "thus robots get some of their oxygen as `` new oxygen '' rather than just taking it from what the tissues would normally get .",
    "this is possible because in this case robots create steeper concentration gradients than the tissue does .",
    "the 10-micron ringset with pumps produces about the same power in the low and high demand scenarios , consuming oxygen at @xmath15 .    comparing the different aggregate sizes shows lower power generation , per robot , in the large aggregate compared to the small one",
    "this arises from the competition among nearby robots for the oxygen .",
    "nevertheless the larger aggregate , with ten times as many robots , generates several times as much power in aggregate as the smaller one .",
    "this difference identifies a design choice for aggregation : larger aggregates have more total power available but less on a per robot basis .",
    "robots using pumps generate only modestly more power than robots relying on diffusion alone in our high capacity design example ( section  [ sect.robot power ] ) . in this case , for robots without pumps , the power generation site density , @xmath16 , is sufficiently large that oxygen molecules diffusing into the robot are mostly consumed by the power generators near the surface of the robot before they have a chance to diffuse back out of the robot .",
    "for such robots , power generators far from the plasma - facing surface receive very little oxygen and hence do not add significantly to the robot power production .",
    "pumps give higher benefit for isolated rings of robots than for tightly clustered aggregates .",
    "although not evaluated in the axially symmetric model used here , pumps may be even more significant for a single isolated robot on the vessel wall .",
    "such a robot would not be competing with any other robots for the available oxygen , though would still compete with nearby tissue .",
    "the low capacity robots have only @xmath17 the maximum power generating capability of the high capacity robots discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , each robot s maximum power is several times larger than the limit due to available oxygen .",
    "thus pumps allow the robots to produce the same power as given in table  [ table.behavior : power ] for the high capacity robots .",
    "the pumps ensure the absorbed oxygen is completely used by the smaller number of reaction sites by increasing the concentration of oxygen within the robots so eq .  (",
    "[ eq.reaction rate ] ) gives the same power generation in spite of the smaller value of @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , the smaller number of reaction sites is a significant limitation for robots without pumps . comparing with table  [ table.behavior : power ] shows pumps improve the average power by factors of about 3 and 8 for the 10 and 1-micron ringsets , respectively . comparing with high capacity robots without pumps shows the factor of 50 reduction in reaction sites only reduces average power by factors of about 3 and 5 for the 10 and 1-micron ringsets , respectively .",
    "thus the reaction sites in the low capacity scenario are used more effectively than in the high capacity robots : with a smaller number of sites , each site does not compete as much with nearby sites for the available oxygen .",
    "much of the power in robots without pumps is generated near the plasma - facing surface , where oxygen concentration is largest . in our case ,",
    "the power for the high capacity robots is generated primarily within @xmath18 of the robot surface .",
    "this observation suggests that a design with power generating sites placed near this surface instead of uniformly throughout the robot volume , as we have assumed , could significantly improve power generation for robots without pumps .",
    "for example , placing all the reaction sites uniformly within the @xmath17 of the robot volume nearest the surface would increase the local reaction site density in that volume by a factor of 50 . for low capacity robots , this placement would increase @xmath16 to the same value as the high capacity case , but only in a narrow volume , within @xmath19 of the surface with the robot geometry we use . elsewhere in the robot with this design @xmath20 . while we might expect this concentration to increase power significantly ,",
    "in fact we find only a small increase ( e.g. , 12% for the 10-micron ringset in the low demand scenario ) . thus concentrating the reaction sites near",
    "the plasma - facing surface does not offer much of a performance advantage .",

    "for robots with pumps , power for high and low capacity cases are the same.,title=\"fig : \" ]    while all robots in a single ring have the same power due to the assumption of axial symmetry , fig .",
    "[ fig.power generation ] shows that power varies with ring position in the 10-micron ringset .",
    "the robots at the upstream edge of the aggregate receive more oxygen than the other robots and hence produce more power .",
    "power generation does not decrease monotonically along the vessel : robots at the downstream edge have somewhat more available oxygen than those in the middle of the aggregate since robots at the edge of the aggregate have less competition for oxygen .",
    "[ fig.power generation ] shows significantly larger benefits of pumps at the edges of multi - ring aggregates than in their middle sections , especially in the low demand scenario .    in the scenarios described above",
    ", robots produce power from all the available oxygen .",
    "this is appropriate for applications requiring as much power as possible for the aggregate as a whole . at the other extreme",
    ", an application requiring the same behavior from all robots in the aggregate would be limited by the robots with the least available power .",
    "this would be the case for identical robots , all of which perform the same task and hence use the same power . in this case , the robots could increase performance by transferring power from those at the edges of the aggregate to those in the middle .",
    "such transfer could take place after generation , e.g. , via shared electric current , or prior to generation by transfer of oxygen among neighboring robots .",
    "however , such internal transfer would require additional hardware capabilities . for robots with pumps ,",
    "an alternative transfer method is for robots near the edge of the aggregate to run their pumps at lower capacity and thus avoid collecting all the oxygen arriving at their surfaces .",
    "this uncollected oxygen would then be available for other robots , though some of this oxygen would be transported by the fluid past the robots or be captured by the tissue rather than other robots .",
    "this approach increases power to robots in the middle of the aggregate without requiring additional hardware for internal transfers between robots , but at the cost of somewhat lower total power for the aggregate . increasing as much as possible the power to the robots with the least power leads to a uniform distribution of power among the robots .    to quantify the trade - off between total power and its uniformity among the robots",
    ", we consider all robots setting each of the pumps on their surfaces to operate at the same rate and the pumps uniformly distributed over the surface .",
    "this gives a uniform flux of oxygen over the entire surface of all the robots .",
    "the largest possible value for this uniform flux , and hence the largest power for the aggregate , occurs when the minimum oxygen concentration on the robot surfaces is zero  at that point , the robot whose surface includes the location of zero concentration can not further increase its uniform flux . for example , in the low demand scenario the maximum value for this uniform flux is approximately @xmath21 .",
    "compared to the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig.power generation ] , this uniform flux gives significantly lower power ( 39% leading ring , 56% trailing ring ) for the robots at the edges of the aggregate , somewhat lower power for robots in positions 2 and 3 ( 87% and 98% , respectively ) and somewhat more power ( ranging from 104% to 116% ) for the other robots .",
    "the combination of these changes gives a total of @xmath22 of the power for the aggregate when every robot collects all the oxygen reaching its surface .",
    "the minimum power per robot increases from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "robots could slightly increase power by accepting some nonuniformity of flux over each surface while maintaining the same total flux to each robot . this would occur when the minimum oxygen concentration on the entire length of the robot surfaces in a particular robot ring is zero .    using this approach to uniform power in practice would require the robots to determine the maximum rate they can operate their pumps while achieving uniform power distribution .",
    "this rate would vary with tissue demand , and also over time as cells pass the robots .",
    "a simple control protocol is for each robot to adjust its pump rate up or down according to whether its power generation is below or above that of its neighbors , respectively .",
    "when concentration reaches zero on one robot , increasing pump rate at that location would not increase power generation .",
    "communicating information for this protocol is likely simpler than the hardware required to internally transfer power or oxygen among robots , but also requires each robot is able to measure its power generation rate .",
    "such measurements and communication would give an effective control provided they operate rapidly compared to the time over which oxygen flux changes , e.g. , as cells pass the robots on millisecond time scales .",
    "longer reaction times could lead to oscillations or chaotic behavior  @xcite .",
    "a second approach to achieving a more uniform distribution of power is to space the robots at some distance from each other on the vessel wall .",
    "this approach would be suitable if the aggregated robots do not need physical contact to achieve their task .",
    "for example , somewhat separating the robots would allow a relatively small number to span a distance along the vessel wall larger than the size of a single cell passing through the vessel .",
    "this aggregate would always have at least some robots between successive cells .",
    "communicating sensor readings among the robots would then ensure the response , e.g. , releasing chemicals , is not affected by misleading sensor values due to the passage of a single cell , giving greater stability and reliability without the need for delaying response due to averaging over sensor readings as an alternative approach to accounting for passing cells .",
    "another example for spaced robots is for directional acoustic communication , at distances of about @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "achieving directional control requires acoustic sources extending over distances comparable to or larger than the sound wavelength .",
    "plausible acoustic communication between nanorobots involves wavelengths of tens of microns  @xcite .    as a quantitative example of the benefit of spacing robots in the context of our axially symmetric model",
    ", we consider a set of rings of robots spaced apart along the vessel wall . when the distance between successive rings is sufficiently large , the power for each ring would be close to that of the isolated 1-micron ring given in table  [ table.behavior : power ] .",
    "for example , the power for the low demand scenario in the 1-micron ring of high - capacity robots decreases from @xmath26 at high inlet concentration to @xmath27 at low inlet concentration , which spans the range of power for a modest number of widely spaced 1-micron rings within a single vessel .",
    "as described in section  [ sect.tissue power and heating ] , oxygen absorption by robots can affect concentration over a few tens of microns upstream of those robots .",
    "thus separating robot rings by , say , @xmath25 will give power close to that of the isolated rings , with a gradual decrease in power for successive rings due to the decreasing cell saturation along the vessel .    a third approach to reducing variation in robot power , on average ,",
    "is through changing pump rates in time .",
    "for example , adjacent nanorobot rings could operate with counterphased 50% duty cycles , with one ring and its second nearest neighbor ring using pumps while the intervening nearest neighbor has its pumps off and does not absorb oxygen .",
    "the alternating rings of robots would switch pumps on and off . in this case",
    ", robots would have larger power than seen in fig .  [ fig.power generation ] for the half of the time they are active , and zero power for the other half .",
    "this temporal approach would not be suitable for tasks requiring all robots to have the same power _ simultaneously _ , but would be useful for tasks requiring higher burst power from robots throughout the aggregate where the robots are unable to store oxygen or power for later use .",
    "provided the duty cycle is sufficiently long , our steady - state model can quantify the resulting power distribution .",
    "for example , in the low demand scenario , total flux for the aggregate is 79% of that when every robot collects all the oxygen reaching its surface , and the minimum power per robot _ drops _ from @xmath23 to @xmath28 .",
    "thus , when averaged over the duty cycle , this temporal technique reduces total power without benefiting the robots receiving the minimum power . in this case",
    ", the temporal approach does not improve minimum robot power ( on average ) since the power gain to a robot while its neighbors are off is less than a factor of 2 , which does not compensate for the loss due to each robot being off for half the time . applying the steady - state model to this temporal variation in robot activity requires the duty cycle be long enough for the system to reach steady - state behavior after each switch between the active subset of robots , and that the switching time is short compared to the duty cycle so most of the robots power arises during the steady - state portions of the cycle between switching .",
    "diffusion provides one lower bound on this time : when neighboring robots switch pumps from on to off or vice versa , the characteristic diffusion time for oxygen over the distance between next nearest neighbors ( one micron ) is about @xmath29 .",
    "adjustments in cell saturation for the 1-micron shift in the location of the active robots between each half of the duty cycle is a further limitation on the duty cycle time for the validity of the steady - state model , though this is likely to be minimal since the cells are separated from the robots by the plasma gap in the fluid . since the steady - state model averages over the position of passing cells , another lower bound on the duty cycle arises from the time for a cell to pass the robots . from the speeds in table  [ table.parameters ] ,",
    "this time is at least @xmath30 .",
    "the dependence of robot power on design parameters described above may appear contrary to simple intuitions .",
    "first , one might expect that the 10-micron ringset , with ten times the surface area in contact with the plasma , would absorb about ten times as much oxygen as the 1-micron ring .",
    "instead we find only about a factor of 2 to 4 increase .",
    "second , the benefit of pumps , less than a factor of 2 for the high capacity robots , may seem surprisingly small .",
    "third , the low capacity robots , with @xmath17 the reaction sites of the high capacity robots , nevertheless generate about @xmath31 as much power as high capacity robots in the case with no pumps . and",
    "finally , in spite of the higher concentration near the robot surface than deep inside the robot when there are no pumps , increasing the reaction site density by placing all the reaction sites near the robot surface gives little benefit .",
    "while the specific values of these designs depend on the geometry and environment used in our model , these general features of small robots obtaining power through diffusion apply in other situations as well .    in this section",
    "we illustrate how these consequences of design choices arise in the context of a scenario for which the diffusion equation has a simple analytic solution , thereby identifying key physical effects leading to these behaviors . specifically",
    ", we consider an isolated spherical robot of radius @xmath32 in a stationary fluid with oxygen concentration @xmath33 far from the sphere .",
    "such a sphere with a fully absorbing surface collects oxygen at a rate @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "this expression illustrates a key property of diffusive capture : the rate depends not on the object s surface area but on its size .",
    "this behavior , which also applies to other shapes  @xcite , arises because while larger objects have greater surface areas they also encounter smaller concentration gradients . as a quantitative example , taking the sphere to have the same volume as the robot , i.e. , @xmath35 given in table  [ table.robot parameters ] , the oxygen absorbed by the sphere generates @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath33 equal to the low and high inlet oxygen concentrations in the plasma from table  [ table.parameters ] , respectively . these power values are larger than for robots on the vessel wall described above .",
    "unlike the sphere in a stationary fluid , the aggregated robots compete with each other for the oxygen , the fluid moves some of the oxygen past the robots before they have a chance to absorb it , and the surrounding tissue also consumes some of the oxygen .",
    "the replenishment of oxygen from the passing blood cells is not sufficient to counterbalance these effects .",
    "the spherical robot also indicates the benefit of pumps .",
    "the fully absorbing sphere , with a zero concentration boundary condition at the surface , corresponds to using pumps . for robots without pumps ,",
    "an approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq.reaction rate ] ) allows a simple solution .",
    "specifically , since the michaelis - menten constant for the robot power generators , @xmath38 , is much larger than the oxygen concentrations ( e.g. , as seen in fig .  [ fig.oxygen concentration ] ) , robot power generation from eq .",
    "( [ eq.reaction rate ] ) is approximately @xmath39 .",
    "dividing by @xmath40 gives the oxygen consumption rate density as @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "solving the diffusion equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.diffusion ] ) , for a sphere in a stationary fluid with concentration @xmath33 far from the sphere , with free diffusion through the sphere s surface and reaction rate density @xmath41 inside the sphere , gives the rate oxygen is absorbed by the sphere ( and hence reacted to produce power ) as  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "thus free diffusion produces a fraction @xmath45 of the power produced by the fully absorbing sphere .",
    "the distance @xmath46 is roughly the average distance an oxygen molecule diffuses in the time a power generation site consumes an oxygen molecule .",
    "when a freely diffusing molecule inside the robot has a high chance to diffuse out of the robot before it reacts ( @xmath46 large compared to @xmath32 ) , @xmath47 is small so pumps provide a significant increase in power .",
    "conversely , when @xmath46 is small compared to @xmath32 , pumps provide little benefit : the large number of reaction sites ensure the robot consumes almost all the diffusing oxygen reaching its surface .",
    "this argument illustrates a tradeoff between using pumps to keep oxygen within the robot and the number of power generators .",
    "in particular , if internal reaction sites are easy to implement , then robots with many reaction sites and no pumps would be a reasonable design choice .",
    "conversely , if reaction sites are difficult to implement while pumps are easy , then robots with pumps and few reaction sites would be a better choice .",
    "a caveat for robots with few power generating sites is that eq .",
    "( [ eq.f mu ] ) applies when oxygen consumption is linear in the concentration , as given by @xmath41 .",
    "this expression allows arbitrarily increasing the reaction rate by increasing the concentration , no matter how small the number of reaction sites .",
    "this linearity is a good approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq.reaction rate ] ) only when @xmath48 . at larger concentrations the power density saturates at @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath16 is sufficiently small , this limit is below the power that could be produced from all the oxygen that a fully absorbing sphere collects .",
    "thus , in practice , the benefit of using pumps estimated from the linear reaction rate , @xmath50 , is limited by this bound when @xmath16 is small .    as an example , for a spherical robot with the high capacity reaction site density of table  [ table.robot parameters ] , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with the fairly modest benefit of pumps @xmath53 .",
    "the low capacity robots have @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 . in this case , the limit due to the maximum reaction rate of eq .  (",
    "[ eq.reaction rate ] ) applies , somewhat limiting the benefit of pumps to a factor of @xmath57 , but pumps still offer considerable benefit .",
    "these values for the benefits of pumps are somewhat larger than seen with our model for robots on the vessel wall .",
    "nevertheless , the spherical example identifies the key physical properties influencing power generation with and without pumps , and how they vary with robot design choices .",
    "( [ eq.f mu ] ) also illustrates why power in the low capacity robots is not as small as one might expect based on the reduction in reaction sites by a factor of 50 .",
    "while the value of @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath59 , the typical diffusion distance @xmath46 varies as @xmath60 , so a decrease in reaction sites by a factor of 50 only increases @xmath46 by about a factor of 7 .",
    "the square root dependence arises from the fundamental property of diffusion : typical distance a diffusing particle travels grows only with the square root of the time .",
    "the modest change in diffusion distance , combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq.f mu ] ) , gives a smaller decrease in power than the factor of 50 decrease in capacity .",
    "the low capacity robot has higher concentrations throughout the sphere , so each reaction site operates more rapidly than in the high capacity case .",
    "this increase partially offsets the decrease in the number of reaction sites .    without pumps , the higher oxygen concentration near the sphere s surface than near",
    "its center means much of the power generation takes place close to the surface .",
    "thus we can expect an increase in power by placing reaction sites close to the surface rather than uniformly distributed throughout the sphere .",
    "consistent with the results from the model described in section  [ sect.model ] , evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq.diffusion ] ) with the reaction confined to a spherical shell shows only a modest benefit compared to a uniform distribution . the benefit is larger for a thinner shell and",
    "is determined by the same ratio , @xmath61 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq.f mu ] ) .",
    "in particular , the largest benefit of using a thin shell , only @xmath62 , occurs for @xmath63 .",
    "the parameters for the high and low capacity robots are somewhat below this optimal value , giving only @xmath64 and less than @xmath65 benefit from a thin shell , respectively , for the sphere .",
    "these modest improvements correspond to the small benefits of using a thin shell seen in the solution to our model for both high and low capacity robots .",
    "hence the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq.diffusion ] ) for the sphere illustrates how , with a fixed number of reaction sites , concentrating them near the robot surface provides only limited benefit .",
    "the benefit of the higher reaction site density in the shell is almost entirely offset by the shorter distance molecules need to diffuse to escape from the thin reactive region .",
    "that is , the benefit of placing all the reaction sites in a thin shell arises from two competing effects .",
    "when @xmath46 is large ( low capacity ) the concentration is only slightly higher near the surface than well inside the sphere .",
    "so there is little benefit from placing the reaction sites closer to the surface . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath46 is small ( high capacity ) , even uniformly distributed reaction sites manage to consume most of the arriving oxygen , giving near - zero concentration at the surface of the sphere and little scope for further improvement by concentrating the reaction sites .",

    "the gray band indicates the 10-micron length of the vessel wall in which the robots are stationed , within the 60-micron length of the capillary illustrated . ]",
    "the robots affect tissue power in two ways .",
    "first , the robots compete for oxygen with nearby tissue .",
    "second , the robots consume oxygen from passing blood cells , thereby leaving less for tissue downstream of the robots .    for the effect on nearby tissue , fig .",
    "[ fig.tissue power ] shows how tissue power density varies next to the vessel wall . in the vessel without robots ,",
    "power density declines slightly with distance along the vessel as the tissue consumes oxygen from the blood .",
    "the total reduction in tissue power density is fairly modest , less than 10% even for high power demand in the tissues . the relative reduction is less for tissue at larger distances from the vessel , though such tissue has lower power generation due to less oxygen reaching tissue far from the vessel .",
    "this reduction arises both from direct competition by the robots for available oxygen and the physical blockage of the capillary wall , forcing surrounding tissue to rely on oxygen diffusing a longer distance from unblocked sections of the wall . in the low demand case , direct competition is the major factor , as seen by the dips in the power density at each end of the aggregate , where the absorbing flux is highest . in the high demand case ,",
    "the tissue s consumption reduces the amount of oxygen diffusing through the tissue on either side of the aggregate , giving the larger drop in tissue power density in the middle of the aggregate .    for longer range consequences ,",
    "[ fig.saturation ] shows how the oxygen saturation in the blood cells changes as they pass the robots . slowly moving cells ( in the low demand scenario )",
    "are substantially depleted while passing the robots , even though tissue power demand in this scenario is low .",
    "this depletion arises from the cells remaining near the robots a relatively long time as cells move slowly with the fluid .",
    "the resulting saturation shown in the figure , around @xmath70 , is below the equilibrium saturation ( @xmath71 ) for typical concentrations at the venous end of capillaries , given in table  [ table.parameters ] .",
    "thus in the low demand scenario , the robots remove more oxygen from passing cells than occurs during their full transit of a vessel containing no robots . in this scenario ,",
    "the tissue has low power demand , so the depletion of oxygen from the cells may have limited effect on tissue along the vessel downstream of the robots .",
    "however , this reduction could significantly limit the number of robots that can be simultaneously present inside a given capillary .",
    "another observation from fig .",
    "[ fig.saturation ] is a significant decrease in cell saturation a short distance _ upstream _ of the robots in the low demand scenario",
    ". we can understand this behavior in terms of the peclet number , which characterizes the relative importance of convection and diffusion over various distances  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath72 is the distance at which diffusion and convection have about the same effect on mass transport in a moving fluid . at significantly longer distances , convection is the dominant effect and absorption of oxygen at a given location in the vessel has little effect on upstream concentrations over such distances . in our scenarios , @xmath72 ranges from @xmath73 ( high demand ) to @xmath74 ( low demand ) .",
    "thus the oxygen concentration in the plasma is significantly affected by the robots over a few tens of microns upstream of their location .",
    "cell saturation remains close to equilibrium in this upstream region ( fig .",
    "[ fig.s - sequib ] ) , hence the reduced oxygen concentration in the plasma lowers cell saturation in this region upstream of the robots ( fig .",
    "[ fig.saturation ] ) .",
    "this distance is also relevant for spacing rings of robots far enough apart to achieve nearly uniform power , as described in section  [ sect.power : distribution ] .",
    "the devices in this example have a volume of @xmath75 so the robot power generation corresponds to power densities around @xmath76 , several orders of magnitude larger than power densities in tissue , raising concerns of possible significant tissue heating by the robots .",
    "however , for the isolated aggregate used in this scenario , waste heat due to the robots power generation is rapidly removed , resulting in negligible maximum temperature elevation of about @xmath77 .",
    "the robots change the fluid flow by constricting the vessel . with the same pressure difference as a vessel without robots , as used in our model , this constriction results in somewhat lower flow speed through the vessel . specifically , the one and ten - micron long aggregates reduce flow speed by 6% and 20% , respectively .",
    "the fluid moving past the robots exerts a force on them . to remain on the wall",
    "the robots must resist this force through their attachment to the vessel wall  @xcite .",
    "this force is a combination of pressure difference , between the upstream and downstream ends of the aggregate , and viscous drag . for the laminar flow the force",
    "@xmath78 is linear in the pressure gradient @xmath10 imposed on the vessel : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the @xmath1 and @xmath82 ringsets , respectively .",
    "for example , the flow imposes a force of @xmath83 on the @xmath1 ringset when the pressure gradient is @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath1 ringset experiences about three times the force of the @xmath82 ring , but covers ten times the surface area .",
    "thus the larger aggregate requires about one - third the attachment force per robot .",
    "applied forces can affect cells  @xcite .",
    "in particular , endothelial cells use forces as a trigger for new vessel growth  @xcite , which is important for modeling changes in the vessels over longer time scales than we consider in this paper  @xcite .",
    "[ sect.discussion ]    the scenarios of this paper illustrate how various physical properties affect robot power generation . robots about one micron in size positioned in rings on capillary walls could generate a few tens of picowatts in steady state from oxygen and glucose scavenged locally from the bloodstream .",
    "aggregates can combine their oxygen intake for tasks requiring higher sustained power generation .",
    "the resulting high power densities do not significantly heat the surrounding tissue , but do introduce steep gradients in oxygen concentration due to the relatively slow reaction kinetics of oxygen release from red cells .",
    "the robots reduce oxygen concentration in nearby tissues , but generally not enough to significantly affect tissue power generation .",
    "the fraction of the generated power available for useful activity within the robot depends on the efficiency of the glucose engine design , with @xmath84 a reasonable estimate for fuel cells  @xcite .",
    "the robots will have @xmath85 of usable steady - state power while on the vessel wall .",
    "as one indication of the usefulness of this power for computation , current nanoscale electronics and sensors have an energy cost per logic operation or sensor switching event of a few hundred @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "while future technology should enable lower energy use  @xcite , even with @xmath87 the available power from circulating oxygen could support several million computational operations per second . at the size of these robots , significant movements of blood cells and",
    "chemical transport occur on millisecond time scales .",
    "thus the power could support thousands of computational operations , e.g. , for chemical pattern recognition , in this time frame .",
    "the aggregated robots could share sensor information and cpu cycles , thereby increasing this capability by a factor of tens to hundreds .",
    "the robots need not generate power as fast as they receive oxygen , but could instead store oxygen received over time to enable bursts of activity as they detect events of interest",
    ". robots with pumps have a significant advantage in burst - power applications because pumps enable long - term high - concentration onboard gas accumulation to support brief periods of near maximal power generation . as an example , in our scenarios individual robots with pumps receive about @xmath88 .",
    "if instead of using this oxygen for immediate power generation , the robot stored the oxygen received over one second , it would have enough to run the power generators at near maximal rate ( giving about @xmath89 ) for several milliseconds .",
    "by contrast , robots without pumps would only have a modest benefit from oxygen diffusing into the robot , achieving a concentration equal to the ambient concentration in the surrounding plasma as given in table  [ table.parameters ] . this concentration could only support generating several hundred picowatts for about a tenth of a millisecond . thus while pumps may give only modest improvement for steady - state power generation , they can significantly increase power available in short bursts .    our model could be extended to estimate the amount of onboard storage that would be required to avoid pathological conditions related to @xmath14  competition between tissues and nanorobots . in particular , larger aggregates would deplete oxygen over longer distances for which diffusion through the tissue from upstream of the robots would be insufficient . furthermore",
    ", larger aggregates of tightly - spaced robots would block transport from the capillary into the surrounding tissue even if the robots did not use much oxygen .",
    "onboard oxygen storage would allow higher transient power densities for the robots , though this could lead to heating issues for larger aggregates .",
    "to estimate the potential for onboard storage , a ringset containing 200 robots with volume @xmath90 of which 10% is devoted to compressed @xmath14  storage at 1000 atmospheres at body temperature can store about @xmath91 molecules of @xmath14  in the aggregate .",
    "the incoming flow in the capillary provides about @xmath92 molecules per second , depending on the flow speed , of which about @xmath93 to @xmath94 is available to the tissue and robots .",
    "this means the oxygen stored in the aggregate is equivalent to only several seconds of oxygen delivery through the vessel .",
    "thus oxygen storage in the robots themselves can not significantly increase mission duration , though such storage might be useful for short - term ( i.e. , a few seconds ) load leveling functions ( e.g. , maintaining function during temporary capillary blockage due to white cell passage ) .",
    "alternatively , the aggregated robots could have oxygen supplemented with a modest circulating population of respirocytes  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath82 spherical robots able to carry oxygen to tissues far more effectively than red blood cells . such robots would continuously and entirely eliminate any oxygen depletion regions in the tissue due to robot power generation , and allow higher robot power generation since oxygen would no longer be such a limiting factor .",
    "such machines could not only carry significantly more oxygen than red blood cells , but would also respond more quickly to abrupt decreases in partial pressure due to consumption by aggregated robots on vessel walls .",
    "for example , sensors should be able to detect the drop in concentration of the size we see near the robots ",
    "e.g. , @xmath95 ( or about @xmath96 )  within a millisecond  @xcite .",
    "this time is short enough that the machines will have moved only about a micron and so will still be near the robots .",
    "once they detect the pressure drop , the machines could release oxygen rapidly , up to @xmath97  @xcite , while passing near the aggregated robots .",
    "however , in practice the release rate is constrained by the effervescence limit in plasma to about @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question for future work is evaluating how much of this released oxygen reaches the robots on the vessel wall , which will depend on how close to the vessel wall the fluid places the respirocytes .",
    "in this situation , aggregated robots could also communicate  @xcite to passing respirocytes to activate or suppress their oxygen delivery , depending on the task at hand .",
    "thus both the oxygen handling capabilities of respirocytes , giving faster kinetics than red cells and larger storage capacity , and the possibility of communication provide examples of the flexibility of small devices with programmable control .",
    "moreover , this scenario illustrates the benefits of mixing robots with differing hardware capabilities .",
    "our model considers static aggregates on vessel walls , but could be extended to study power availability for aggregates that move along the walls  @xcite .",
    "another significant scenario is robots moving passively with the fluid , where they could draw oxygen from the surrounding plasma .",
    "the oxygen unloading model used here could evaluate how rapidly nearby cells would replenish oxygen in the plasma as the cells and robots move through the capillary .",
    "we treat environmental parameters ( e.g. , fluid flow speed and tissue oxygen demand ) as fixed by the surroundings . beyond the local changes in the robots environment described by the model , sustained use of these robots could induce larger scale responses .",
    "for example , the increased use of oxygen by the robots could lead to increased blood flow , as occurs with , say , exercising muscles , by increased pressure to drive the fluid at higher speed or dilation of the vessels .",
    "the local oxygen deficits due to high robot power use are smaller in scale than higher tissue demand ( e.g. , from increased activity in a muscle ) .",
    "thus an important open question is whether localized robot oxygen consumption over a long period of time can initiate a less localized response to increase flow in the vessels .",
    "the possibility of large - scale responses to robot activity raises a broader issue for nanomedicine treatment design when technology allows altering the normal correlation among physical quantities used for signalling in the body  @xcite .",
    "an example at larger scales is the response to low oxygen mediated by excess carbon dioxide in the blood , which can lead to edema and other difficulties for people at high altitudes  @xcite . in terms of downstream consequences of the robots oxygen use",
    ", low saturation of cells leaving an isolated capillary should not be a problem because the bulk of oxygen exchange occurs in the capillary bed , not in the larger collecting vessels .",
    "however , cells reaching low saturation before exiting the capillary would produce localized anoxia in the tissue near the end of the capillary .",
    "this could be relieved in part by oxygen diffusion from neighboring tissue cells if the anoxic region is not too large or too severe .",
    "specific effects of such localized anoxia remain to be fully identified .",
    "whole capillaries subjected to ischemic conditions over a period of days remodel themselves , e.g. , by adding new vascular branches and by increasing the tortuosity of existing vessels  @xcite .",
    "this observed behavior is likely to be a localized ( i.e. , cell - level ) response , hence we might expect such a response if a portion of a capillary downstream of the robots was driven into ischemic conditions .",
    "there could also be a localized inflammatory response to a large enough number of capillary - wall endothelial cells under stress , especially for cells stressed to the point of apoptosis , but moderate ischemia alone seems unlikely to generate this response  @xcite .",
    "various chemicals ( e.g. , adrenalin ) make the heart pump faster and thus drive the blood at higher speed .",
    "other chemicals ( such as no , pgd2 and ltd4 ) dilate the vessels .",
    "these chemicals can produce significant activity in the endothelial cells that line ( and thus form the tube geometry of ) the capillary vessel , so their influence can be fairly direct and quick  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a large robot population constantly drawing excess oxygen supply could induce elevated erythropoietin secretion ( if unregulated by the robots ) , increasing red cell production in the erythroid marrow  @xcite .",
    "direct heating is not a problem with aggregates of the size considered here , in spite of their high power density compared to tissue . for the large aggregate we examined ( tightly covering @xmath1 along the vessel wall ) , oxygen diffusion through the tissue from regions upstream and downstream of the robots provided oxygen to the tissue outside the section of the vessel blocked by the robots .",
    "larger aggregates , especially if tightly packed , would significantly reduce oxygen in the tissues even if the robots used little power themselves , simply due to their covering the vessel wall over a long enough distance that diffusion through the tissue from unblocked regions is no longer effective .",
    "the inducement of nonlinear tissue thermal responses ( e.g. , inflammation or fever ) due to the heat generated by larger aggregates or multiple aggregates in nearby capillaries is an important question for future work .",
    "nanorobots parked or crawling along the luminal surface of the vessel may activate mechanosensory responses from the endothelial cells across whose surfaces the nanorobots touch  @xcite .",
    "if the aggregates cover a long section of the vessel wall , they could produce local edemas since narrowing of the vessels by the presence of the nanorobots increases local pressure gradients and fluid velocities .",
    "while we focus on a single aggregate in one microscopic vessel , additional issues arise if a large population of circulating robots form many aggregates .",
    "in that case , the multiple aggregates will increase hydrodynamic resistance throughout the fluidic circuit .",
    "thus the robots could make the heart work slightly harder to pump fluid against the slightly higher load .",
    "moreover , if robot aggregates detach from the wall without complete disaggregation , these smaller aggregates moving in the blood may be large enough to block a small vessel .",
    "the scenarios examined in this paper can suggest suitable controls to distribute power when robots aggregate . moreover , power control decisions interact with the choices made for the aggregation process .",
    "for example , if the task requires a certain amount of total power for the aggregate ( e.g. , as a computation hub ) then the aggregation self - assembly protocol would depend on how much oxygen is available , e.g. , to make a larger aggregate in vessels with less available oxygen , or recruit more passing robots when the task needs more power .",
    "an example of this latter case could be if aggregates are used as computation hubs to validate responses to rare events : when local sensor readings indicate the possibility of such an event , the aggregate could temporarily recruit additional robots to increase power and computational capability for evaluating whether those readings warrant initiating treatment .",
    "another approach to designing controls for teams of robots is the formalism of partially observable markov processes  @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows for arbitrarily complex computations among the robots to update their beliefs about their environment and other robots .",
    "unfortunately this generality leads to intractable computations for determining optimal control processes .",
    "for the situations we studied , the power constraints on capillary wall - resident microscopic robots operating with oxygen available _ in vivo _ means the local rules must be simple . including this constraint in the formalism could allow it to identify feasible control choices for large aggregates of microscopic robots in these situations .",
    "the power constraints from our model could provide useful parameters for less detailed models of the behavior of large numbers of robots in the circulation in the context of the scenarios examined in this paper .",
    "in particular , power limits the computation , communication and locomotion capabilities of the robots .",
    "these constraints could be incorporated in simplified models , such as cellular automata approaches to robot behavior .",
    "these automata are a set of simple machines , typically arranged on a regular lattice .",
    "each machine is capable of communicating with its neighbors on the lattice and updates its internal state based on a simple rule .",
    "for example , a two - dimensional scenario shows how robots could assemble structures  @xcite using local rules .",
    "such models can help understand structures formed at various scales through simple local rules and some random motions  @xcite .",
    "a related analysis technique considers swarms  @xcite , i.e. , groups of many simple machines or biological organisms such as ants . in these systems , individuals use simple rules to determine their behavior from information about a limited portion of their environment and neighboring individuals .",
    "typically , individuals in swarms are not constrained to have a fixed set of neighbors but instead continually change their neighbors as they move .",
    "swarm models are well - suited to microscopic robots with their limited physical and computational capabilities and large numbers .",
    "most swarm studies focus on macroscopic robots or behaviors in abstract spaces  @xcite . in spite of the simplified physics ,",
    "these studies show how local interactions among robots lead to various collective behaviors  @xcite and provide broad design guidelines . a step toward more realistic , though still tractable",
    ", models of large aggregates could incorporate the power constraints from the model presented in this paper .",
    "in addition to evaluating performance of hypothetical medical nanorobots , theoretical studies identifying tradeoffs between control complexity and hardware capabilities can aid future fabrication .",
    "one example is the design complexity of the robot s fuel acquisition and utilization systems . for steady - state operation on vessel walls , we found limited benefit of pumps over free diffusion when numerous onboard power generators can be employed . in such cases ,",
    "our results indicate that a design without pumps does not sacrifice much performance .",
    "more generally , control can compensate for limited hardware ( e.g. , sensor errors or power limitations ) , providing design freedom to simplify the hardware through additional control programs .",
    "thus the studies could help determine minimum hardware performance capabilities needed to provide robust systems - level behavior .",
    "a key challenge for robot design studies based on approximate models is validating the results . in our case ,",
    "the most significant approximations are the treatment of cells as an averaged component in the fluid and the lumped - model kinetics for oxygen unloading . with increased computational power , numerical solution of more accurate models",
    "could test the validity of these approximations . as technology",

    "<S> the power available to microscopic robots ( nanorobots ) that oxidize bloodstream glucose while aggregated in circumferential rings on capillary walls is evaluated with a numerical model using axial symmetry and time - averaged release of oxygen from passing red blood cells . </S>",
    "<S> robots about one micron in size can produce up to several tens of picowatts , in steady - state , if they fully use oxygen reaching their surface from the blood plasma . </S>",
    "<S> robots with pumps and tanks for onboard oxygen storage could collect oxygen to support burst power demands two to three orders of magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate effects of oxygen depletion and local heating on surrounding tissue . </S>",
    "<S> these results give the power constraints when robots rely entirely on ambient available oxygen and identify aspects of the robot design significantly affecting available power . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , our numerical model provides an approach to evaluating robot design choices for nanomedicine treatments in and near capillaries .    </S>",
