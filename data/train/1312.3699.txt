    "despite the successes of the ads / cft correspondence , a full understanding of the duality is still lacking . since the original conjecture @xcite , much of the research effort has been aimed at developing a precise dual dictionary connecting geometric quantities in the bulk to observables in the boundary field theory .",
    "however , this dictionary remains poorly understood , hampering our ability to reconstruct the bulk geometry from the field theory , compute field theory quantities from the classical bulk theory , and assess whether or not the correspondence is complete .",
    "this last effort has been placed under scrutiny by the recent controversy over the black hole interior ( see e.g.@xcite ) , and direct efforts to construct  or demonstrate an inability to construct  a full dual dictionary , may serve to address it .    to resolve such questions , a good starting point is the identification of bulk probes that depend primarily on the bulk geometry and are dual by the ads / cft dictionary to known field theory observables .",
    "the existence of such bulk probes is not guaranteed ; however , spacelike extremal surfaces , which are covariantly - defined and depend exclusively on the bulk geometry , are dual to well - understood field theory observables .",
    "in fact , spacelike extremal surfaces constitute most of the probes used in ads / cft .",
    "the dual observables include correlators @xcite , entanglement entropy @xcite , and wilson loops @xcite .",
    "the length of spacelike geodesics with boundary endpoints allows one to compute , in the wkb approximation , the two - point correlator of a high conformal dimension field operator at the endpoints .",
    "the area of a codimension 2 spacelike extremal surface anchored on some region @xmath0 on the boundary of an asymptotically locally anti - de sitter ( alads ) spacetime is associated with the entanglement entropy of @xmath0 within the boundary field theory .    a field theory observable which is dual to an extremal surface must in some way",
    "encode information about the bulk geometry at the location of the extremal surface .",
    "if there is a limit on how far into the bulk such surfaces can reach , this also limits our ability to reconstruct the geometry from the corresponding dual observables .",
    "the natural question that arises is how much of the bulk can be recovered from extremal surface probes .",
    "extremal surface probes and their maximal reach were studied in @xcite for the case of static and translationally or spherically symmetric asymptotically ads spacetimes , and in a large amount of literature ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) for eternal ads black holes .",
    "studies have also been done for extremal surfaces in time - dependent geometries ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we establish a general constraint on the reach of probe spacelike extremal surfaces in spacetimes which are not necessarily alads .",
    "we find that many generic geometries admit a certain kind of surface which acts as a barrier for probe surfaces anchored to one boundary .",
    "we furthermore show that trapped surfaces with nonpositive null extrinsic curvature give rise to extremal surface barriers , and that  on spacetimes which admit a totally geodesic spatial slice ",
    "the existence of barriers implies the existence of either a singularity or a marginally trapped surface .",
    "more explicitly , we consider a codimension 1 `` splitting surface '' @xmath1 which divides the spacetime into two regions .",
    "@xmath1 may be spacelike , timelike , or null .",
    "we take some class @xmath2 of spacelike extremal surfaces of codimension 1 or greater , which are anchored to some boundary @xmath3 on one side of @xmath1 .",
    "then , given two simple assumptions , we can show that no members of this class of extremal surfaces cross ( or even touch ) @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the splitting surface acts as an extremal surface barrier .",
    "the two assumptions are as follows :    1 .",
    "all of the extremal surfaces in the class @xmath2 can be continuously deformed ( while remaining extremal ) to surfaces which lie on the exterior of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 has nonpositive extrinsic curvature ( as measured by normal vectors pointing outward , towards the exterior of @xmath1 ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath1 can only bend outward relative to its tangent plane .",
    "given these assumptions , @xmath1 acts as a barrier to any of the extremal surfaces lying in the class @xmath2 .",
    "this generalizes some previously known result in riemannian manifolds , that surfaces with an inward - pointing mean curvature vector can sometimes act as local barriers to minimal surfaces , and also act as global barriers in certain circumstances ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our proof uses elements from the approach of @xcite and @xcite , and shows that spacelike extremal surfaces can not approach surfaces with negative extrinsic curvature .",
    "they can , however , approach arbitrarily close to totally geodesic surfaces .",
    "we do not need to make any assumptions about causality or an energy condition ; the restriction is purely geometrical in nature .",
    "the first criterion is often satisfied : it simply requires that there be no obstruction to deforming the extremal surface ( while maintaining extremality ) away from @xmath1 .",
    "( e.g. geodesics in the btz black hole geometry @xcite ) .",
    "this is not an issue for our proof , since we do not require that the deformed extremal surface be minimal .",
    "] in many cases , this criterion holds for all extremal surfaces due to the topology and geometry of the spacetime , so the class @xmath2 consists of all extremal surfaces . for example , this is true in vacuum ads spacetimes . more generally , if the extremal surfaces are anchored to just one connected component of the boundary @xmath3 , and the bulk spacetime is homotopically trivial , then all surfaces may be continuously deformed towards @xmath3 .",
    "however , it may be an additional constraint on the geometry that the surfaces can remain extremal while this happens .",
    "for example , if there is another region @xmath4 which acts as a barrier to extremal surfaces anchored anywhere on the boundary of the spacetime @xmath5 , then @xmath4 may be an obstruction to deforming extremal surfaces past @xmath1 .",
    "the second criterion may be satisfied by a totally geodesic surface , i.e. a surface with vanishing extrinsic curvature . can also be equivalently defined as a surface @xmath1 in @xmath6 such that every geodesic on @xmath1 ( with respect to the induced connection on @xmath1 ) is also a geodesic on @xmath7 ( with respect to the connection on @xmath7 . ]",
    "an example of such a surface is a non  expanding black hole horizon ( which , given the area theorem @xcite , is a stationary black horizon for spacetimes obeying the null energy condition ) . however , totally geodesic surfaces do not appear in generic spacetimes .",
    "fortunately , the result also applies to surfaces with negative extrinsic curvature , which can appear in generic spacetimes .",
    "examples will be given in section [ examples ] .",
    "in fact , if there exists a surface @xmath1 whose extrinsic curvature is negative everywhere , we will show that it is not actually the tightest bound on extremal surfaces .",
    "there will be some other `` outermost '' barrier @xmath4 some distance away , which has at least partly nonnegative extrinsic curvature ( in section [ singularities ] , we will prove a theorem relating compact outermost barriers to trapped surfaces and singularities ) .",
    "the existence of such extremal surface barriers and their link to singularities is a curiosity which is of relevance to the firewall controversy .",
    "the fact that many bulk probes do not extend beyond the barrier may suggest that the firewall , if it exists , may be at or behind the outermost barrier . at the very least",
    ", it shows that field theory observables that are dual to extremal surfaces anchored at one boundary do not directly reveal any information about the interior .",
    "any information about this region in the bulk must come from probes that are not extremal surfaces . in some cases , the presence of a barrier",
    "might even indicate that the boundary field theory does not have sufficient information to reconstruct the geometry behind the barrier @xcite . in that case ,",
    "additional factors of the hilbert space may be needed to describe that region .",
    "an interpretation involving a loss of determinism may at first seem implausible in the case where @xmath1 is spacelike : one could use the bulk equations of motion to evolve the information in @xmath1 forwards or backwards in time and thus reconstruct some or all of the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the presence of a firewall at @xmath1 would result in a breakdown of the classical bulk equations of motion . in this case , our hope of reconstructing the interior of @xmath1 relies entirely on the ads / cft correspondence dictionary .",
    "this dictionary , however , is primarily composed of extremal surface probes , which we prove below can not probe past @xmath1 . this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ theorem ] , we prove our sufficient condition for a spacetime to have a `` barrier surface '' past which extremal surfaces can not reach ; we further prove that trapped surfaces form extremal surface barriers .",
    "we will also show that the outermost barrier surface must have partly nonnegative extrinsic curvature .",
    "section [ examples ] provides examples of bulk spacetimes with extremal surface barriers . in section [ singularities ]",
    ", we prove that in a certain a class of geometries , barriers occur only in the presence of singularities or trapped surfaces .",
    "we first prove in two parts that extremal surfaces do not probe past surfaces with a nonpositive extrinsic curvature tensor , and further , that barriers with everywhere negative extrinsic curvature are not the outermost barrier surfaces .",

    "we start with two definitions .",
    "define a codimension 1 surface @xmath1 in @xmath7 to be a _ splitting surface _ if it separates @xmath7 into two open regions , ext@xmath8 and int@xmath8 , where we define the interior and exterior relative to the normal which defines the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath9 .",

    "the simplest example is pure ads itself .",
    "if we consider the metric on the poincar patch : @xmath137 surfaces of constant @xmath138 or surfaces of constant @xmath139 are totally geodesic .",
    "since extremal surfaces in pure ads remain on constant time slices , it is clear that they do not cross constant @xmath138 totally geodesic surfaces .",
    "similarly , a surface which is anchored between @xmath140 and @xmath141 will not propagate to @xmath142 or @xmath143 .",
    "the next example we consider is an isotropic ads cosmology .",
    "the metric on global ads can be written , via a coordinate transformation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as an open friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe in the interior of the lightcone , and foliated into de sitter slices in the exterior of the lightcone : @xmath144 where the two are related via an analytic continuation ( see fig . [ frw ] ) .",
    "any small perturbation to this metric results in a curvature singularity replacing the coordinate singularity .",
    "if we couple the metric to , say , a scalar field , as in @xcite , the resulting geometry features a curvature singularity ( the first indication of some sort of an accumulation surface for codimension 2 surfaces in this geometry was found in @xcite ) : @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 at the lightcone and @xmath148 is a big - crunch collapse .",

    "we demonstrate the barrier at work here using spacelike radial geodesics as an example of extremal surface probes .",
    "this is easily generalized to extremal surfaces with fewer symmetries , but for brevity we limit ourselves to the simplest case .    consider a geodesic with endpoints at @xmath155 and @xmath156 , where @xmath125 is one of the suppressed angles in eq .",

    "we solve for the geodesic from the lightcone interior outwards , starting from @xmath160 to the lightcone and the exterior region , using the reflection symmetry in @xmath125 along the geodesic path .    since @xmath158 is a cyclic coordinate ,",
    "the hamiltonian is conserved : @xmath161 solving for @xmath162 yields : @xmath163 since the scale factor vanishes at the lightcone and at the singularity , and reaches its maximum at some intermediate time @xmath153 , it follows from eq .",
    "[ tprime ] that any geodesic with @xmath164 must propagate towards progressively larger @xmath138 .",

    "one implication of this result is that , in the isotropic ads cosmology , only geodesics on the exterior of @xmath1 make it to the lightcone at @xmath168 and from there to the boundary .",
    "the totally geodesic surface prevents boundary - anchored probes from getting arbitrarily close to the singularity .",
    "another prominent example of a spacetime with a totally geodesic barrier surface as prescribed in section [ theorem ] includes any black hole with a stationary horizon @xcite .",
    "this category includes alads spacetimes such as schwarzschild - ads , rn - ads , kerr - ads , the btz black hole , the planar ads black hole ( the horizon in this case was separately proven to be a barrier surface in @xcite ) , and the hyperbolic ads black hole . in particular , in ads - schwarzschild , there are two totally geodesic surfaces : the past- and future - directed horizons , denoted @xmath169 and @xmath170 in fig .",
    "spacelike extremal surfaces anchored at @xmath171 must therefore always remain in region 1 , while those anchored at @xmath172 must remain in region 3 of the spacetime .",
    "extremal surfaces anchored at both @xmath171 and @xmath172 are not constrained by our theorems to remain in any part of the spacetime .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that spacelike geodesics with one endpoint at @xmath171 and one endpoint at @xmath172 can probe arbitrarily close to the singularity , and in particular , can cross both @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "we emphasize that this does not contradict our results in the previous section because these geodesics are anchored to two boundaries . as a point of interest",
    ", @xcite found a barrier surface , or accumulation surface , for codimension 2 extremal surfaces anchored to both boundaries , while , as noted above , radial geodesics observe no such barrier .",
    ", has just one boundary , does not have a barrier for all extremal surfaces because spacelike geodesics which enter at early times can leave at arbitrarily late times .",
    "however , there is an effective barrier for surfaces that are anchored to the boundary at late times , and there may be a barrier for codimension 2 surfaces . following the first version of this paper , an analysis of the behavior of extremal surfaces in some vaidya spacetimes was done in @xcite . ]",
    "it is clear at this point that spacetimes with singularities seem to have a particular proclivity for admitting barriers .",
    "this is not a coincidence : corollary 2.6 states that null surfaces foliated by ( marginally ) trapped surfaces act as barriers at least for codimension 2 extremal surfaces .",
    "if we additionally assume the stronger statement that _ all _ components of the null extrinsic curvature are nonpositive , we found in corollary 2.4 . that it is a barrier to extremal surfaces of every dimension .",
    "in particular , when the null barrier @xmath1 is spatially compact , i.e. the entire boundary is in ext@xmath8 , then @xmath1 is ruled by trapped surfaces .",
    "if the spacetime is furthermore globally ( or ads ) hyperbolic , spatially noncompact , and obeys the null curvature condition , the existence of trapped surfaces guarantees the existence of singularities and horizons @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will prove a partial converse of our conclusions from corollary 2.4 : barriers imply the existence of trapped surfaces or singularities , at least for spacetimes which admit a totally geodesic spacelike slice .",
    "it is worthwhile here to comment on any bearing this might have on the recent controversy over the completeness of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the question of whether the black interior is fully described by the boundary field theory is particularly relevant to this discussion . in @xcite , it was shown that there exist operators in the static black hole interior that can not exist in the dual field theory .",
    "the fact that a well - used probe of the bulk geometry can not reach into a bulk region which is not completely described by the boundary field theory may not be coincidental . since the limited reach of extremal surfaces in the static black hole geometry is simply a special case of the barrier theorems presented in section [ theorem ] , we may expect that other black hole alads geometries admitting barriers may manifest similar incompleteness on the dual field theory side .",
    "one may also speculate that field theories dual to other geometries , not necessarily black holes , may exhibit the same behavior near a singularity .",
    "the examples in the previous section suggest that there is some connection between singularities ( particularly singularities masked by horizons ) , and extremal surface barriers . in this section",
    ", we will prove this result in some special cases .",
    "consider a spacetime manifold @xmath7 containing a totally geodesic spacelike slice @xmath173 .",
    "such slices can be found , for instance , in static spacetimes , or more generally , spacetimes with a moment of time reflection symmetry .",
    "since we intend to drop in extremal surfaces from the boundary of @xmath173 , we must assume that @xmath173 is noncompact . because @xmath173 is totally geodesic , these extremal surfaces remain on @xmath173 .",
    "suppose further that there is an outermost barrier @xmath1 such that the intersection between @xmath1 and @xmath173 is nonempty and compact .",
    "then we prove below that @xmath173 either admits a singularity , or else a marginally trapped surface .    if , in addition , we assume global hyperbolicity ( including alads spacetimes with the appropriate generalization of global hyperbolicity ) , the null curvature condition ( @xmath174 for all null vectors @xmath175 ) and the generic condition ( roughly , that each null ray encounters at least a little bit of null curvature or shear ) then the existence of a marginally trapped surface itself implies the existence of a singularity somewhere on @xmath7 @xcite .    we first prove a lemma : + * theorem 4.1 : * no compact extremal surface barrier @xmath1 in @xmath7 ever touches extremal surfaces anchored to @xmath3 .",
    "we prove this by contradiction .",
    "let @xmath1 be a barrier , and suppose there exists a spacelike extremal surface @xmath22 which is anchored to @xmath3 . by assumption , @xmath176 everywhere except where it coincides . in any neighborhood of such a coincident point @xmath32",

    "@xmath22 can therefore touch @xmath1 while remaining anchored on the boundary .",
    "but then we can slightly deform @xmath22 in a neighborhood of @xmath32 , to make a new surface @xmath179 which crosses @xmath1 . using the elliptical equation of extremality",
    ", we can solve for @xmath179 outside the neighborhood as well . because the perturbation is small , @xmath179",
    "must still be anchored to the boundary .",
    "this shows that @xmath1 is not a barrier , and we have arrived at a contradiction .",
    "theorem 4.1 may at first seem to indicate that compact outermost barriers can not exist , since we have defined outermost barriers as the boundary of the union of some set of extremal surfaces : one might naturally ask how the outermost barrier is constructed , if extremal surfaces can not touch it .",
    "the barrier must be constructed as a limit of extremal surfaces that come arbitrarily close to touching it .",
    "we assume therefore , that one can find sequences of extremal surfaces approaching any point @xmath32 , whose limit is an extremal surface tangent to @xmath1 at @xmath32 .",
    "however , the limiting extremal surface must not be anchored anymore to the boundary , or it would contradict theorem 4.1 .",
    "we will make use of this limit construction of the outermost barrier in the proof of theorem 4.2 below , where we prove a condition relating the existence of barriers to the presence of singularities and trapped surfaces .    because we are taking a limit of extremal surfaces",
    ", one may worry that this limit will be related to the boundary in a bizarre way , perhaps by spiraling around , getting arbitrarily close to the boundary without actually being anchored to it .",

    "1 .   there exists a singularity outside or on @xmath183 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath183 is a marginally trapped surface ( in either time direction ) .",
    "since @xmath183 is an outermost barrier , there exist extremal surfaces that either coincide with it and are tangent to it at coincident points , or come arbitrarily close to coinciding with it .",
    "the former case is ruled out by theorem 4.1 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a family of spacelike extremal surfaces that approach arbitrarily close to some point @xmath184 while remaining weakly anchored on @xmath185 . in a neighborhood of @xmath186",
    ", we take the limit of these surfaces @xmath179 of @xmath187 that reaches @xmath1 at @xmath186 .",

    "when we solve this equation , by theorem 4.1 , @xmath179 must no longer be weakly anchored on @xmath188 .",
    "since @xmath179 can not be weakly anchored to @xmath188 , part of it must terminate somewhere in the interior of the spacetime .",
    "it can do it in one of the following two ways ( fig .",
    "[ thm3 ] ) :    ( a ) : :    @xmath179 terminates in a singularity on or outside    @xmath183 , or ( b ) : :    @xmath179 spirals outside @xmath183 forever ,    without ever coming to an end . in that case , we can define    @xmath189 to be the limit set of the extremal surface    as it gets arbitrarily far away from the points where it is anchored    to the boundary . is not ( weakly ) anchored    to the boundary anywhere , then @xmath190 . ]",

    "if ( a ) is true , we get the first part of the claim .",
    "we now show that ( b ) results in the second part of the claim .",
    "to do so , we need to show that @xmath193 .",
    "we do this by contradiction .",
    "suppose @xmath194 .",
    "then @xmath195 .",
    "this means that it is _ not _ a barrier for extremal surfaces weakly anchored at @xmath3 , and therefore by theorem 2.1 there must exist a point @xmath196 such that @xmath197    on the other hand , by construction , @xmath198 can come arbitrarily close to @xmath191 at any point @xmath199 .",
    "this implies that the following holds everywhere : @xmath200 ( the proof is essentially the same as theorem 2.7 , but reversing the roles of the interior and exterior . )    we have arrived at a contradiction , so instead we must assume that @xmath201 .",
    "this tells us that @xmath179 must in fact coincide with @xmath183 .",
    "since @xmath179 is extremal , it follows that @xmath183 satisfies @xmath202 this is the same as saying that @xmath183 is a marginally trapped surface , which proves the second part of the claim .",
    "the assumption that there exists an outermost barrier @xmath183 for codimension 2 extremal surfaces living on @xmath173 is reasonable : if we take @xmath7 to have a totally geodesic slice @xmath173 and a compact outermost barrier @xmath1 such that @xmath203 , then in general , we expect that @xmath204 will be compact , and be a barrier for extremal surfaces on @xmath173 . there should then exist some outermost @xmath183 which , at least for alads spacetimes , will still be compact .",
    "( if there is a barrier for _ all _ extremal surfaces , then obviously there must be a barrier for those which are codimension 2 and restricted to @xmath173 . )    if we further assume global hyperbolicity , the null curvature condition , and the generic condition , we are able to say that marginally trapped surfaces only occur in geodesically incomplete spacetimes , so that barriers in these spacetimes exist only in the presence of singularities @xcite .",
    "singularities are therefore intrinsically linked to extremal surface barriers . assuming some form of cosmic censorship , these singularities must be hidden behind horizons , thus outermost barriers are also linked to horizons .",
    "in particular , the direct application of theorem 4.2 to the ads / cft correspondence suggests that in general , extremal surface probes are not good probes for spacetimes with singularities .",
    "we expect that theorem 4.2 can be further generalized to both the noncompact barrier case , as section [ cosmology ] suggests , and to any time - dependent geometry , although this may require assuming the null curvature condition ( implied by the null energy condition and einstein s equations ) , even to prove the existence of the trapped surface .",
    "we proved in theorem 2.1 , theorem 2.2 , and corollary 2.4 that a splitting surface with nonpositive extrinsic curvature acts as a barrier to extremal surfaces ( at least those which are @xmath1-deformable ) .",
    "this can include spacelike , timelike , or null barrier surfaces .",
    "if we are only interested in barriers to codimension 2 surfaces ( as used in the holographic entanglement entropy conjecture @xcite ) , then we have shown in theorem 2.5 and corollary 2.6 that null surfaces foliated by ( marginally ) trapped surfaces are barriers .",
    "conversely , for spacetimes with a totally geodesic slice , the existence of a barrier guarantees the existence of either singularities or else trapped surfaces for spacetimes with a totally geodesic slice @xmath173 , so long as the intersection of the barrier and @xmath173 is compact .",
    "we also showed that outermost barriers have at least one nonnegative extrinsic curvature component ( theorem 2.7 ) , and we argued that extremal surface barriers occur somewhat generically in alads spacetimes .",
    "this presents a setback to attempts to reconstruct the bulk geometries from field theory operators using extremal surface probes .",
    "these results are particularly troubling in light of how pervasive extremal surface probes are in applications of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "if there are regions which can not be reconstructed from the entire boundary , than either those regions do not really exist as semiclassical regions ( e.g. because there is a firewall at their boundary ) , or else if they do exist , the information inside of them must be contained in a new factor of the hilbert space which is in addition to the boundary @xcite .",
    "we have also studied cases in which there is a barrier to extremal surfaces located on only _",
    "part _ of the boundary . in this case",
    "it is not surprising that the entire bulk can not be reconstructed .",
    "thus the location of the barrier might give clues about how much of the bulk can be reconstructed from a cft region .",
    "see @xcite for discussion of this question .",
    "one should bear in mind that extremal surfaces are not the only probe used in ads / cft .",
    "if there are other bulk probes besides extremal surfaces , it is possible that a firewall ( if it exists at all ) might be located somewhere behind the outermost barrier .",
    "conversely , if there are some extremal surfaces which do not actually correspond to dual observables ( for example , because they are not the _ minimum _ area extremal surface ) , then it could conceivably be that the firewall is actually outside of the barrier",
    ". it may also be that there are regions of space where _ some _ kinds of extremal surfaces can probe , but not enough to fully reconstruct the geometry .",
    "it is unclear what the status of these regions would be .    in the case of a vaidya spacetime",
    "where a black hole forms from the collapse of a shell , there is no extremal surface barrier . in particular",
    ", there are spacelike geodesics which pass through any point of the black hole interior .",
    "the amps argument for firewalls @xcite applies to sufficiently old black holes that form from collapse , yet the absence of a barrier might seem to suggest that there can be no firewall",
    ". however , the spacelike geodesics in question are anchored at very large time separation on the boundary .",
    "in fact , @xcite argued that the wkb stationary phase approximation is not dominated by spacelike geodesics passing through the interior of the black hole , but rather by complex geodesics .",
    "it is unclear how to use the barrier results proven here in the case where the extremal surfaces are complex , as was found in @xcite for two - point correlators in the case of an ads - schwarzschild bulk .",
    "however , even for the vaidya spacetime , we still find that there is a partial barrier , for spacelike surfaces anchored sufficiently far to the future of the collapsing shell .",
    "this is because the spacetime is just schwarzschild at late times .",
    "thus the extremal surface barrier might still give clues about the location of the firewall , although it does not necessarily tell us when the firewall would first appear .",
    "in general , our knowledge of the ads / cft dictionary comes from a bootstrapping procedure where ( a ) proposed new ingredients to the dictionary can be checked using our knowledge of bulk physics , while ( b ) the behavior of the bulk can also be predicted using the dictionary .",
    "but if at step ( b ) , our current understanding of the dictionary predicts a firewall  resulting in a breakdown of the bulk equations of motion used at step ( a)then it is unclear how to proceed . should we modify the bulk equations of motion or the dictionary ?",
    "perhaps it is the local bulk equations of motion which should be kept sacrosanct , and other things we think we know about ads / cft should be modified in order to preserve them .",
    "ultimately , the question is what choice of dictionary leads to the most consistent , complete , and interesting form of the correspondence .",
    "there are several remaining questions worth noting .",
    "first , we have yet to find a complete description of the most general barrier , in particular for the outermost barrier surface .",
    "such a description would facilitate an understanding of precisely how generic extremal surface barriers are .",
    "we expect that , assuming the null curvature condition , it should be possible to show that compact outermost barriers can only occur in spacetimes with singularities .",
    "we note that ( aside from theorem 2.5 ) the main results of this paper are purely geometrical in nature ",
    "they apply to any lorentzian spacetime without needing to use of any energy condition restricting the sign of the curvature .",
    "( although given the existence of trapped surfaces as shown in theorem 4.2 , the null curvature condition would say that there must be singularities . )",
    "this suggests that our results are still valid even in semiclassical spacetimes ( e.g. evaporating black holes ) where local energy conditions are violated .",
    "however , the significance of these geometrical results for ads / cft is not the same , since in the semiclassical ( finite @xmath22 ) regime , there are quantum corrections to the dictionary relating extremal surfaces to boundary physics .",
    "for example , the entanglement entropy of a cft region is no longer given just by the area of an extremal surface .",
    "instead it receives corrections due to the bulk entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "thus we should really be interested in surfaces which extremize the area _ plus _ the bulk entanglement entropy . to find barriers to these surfaces",
    ", it is natural to look for null surfaces foliated by quantum trapped surfaces , where the sum of the area and the bulk entropy is decreasing .",
    "one can then prove quantum generalizations of the types of classical theorems proven here @xcite .",
