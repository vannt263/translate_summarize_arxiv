    "the cepheid mid - infrared ( mir ) period - luminosity ( p - l , also known as leavitt law ) relations will be important in the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ era , as it holds the promise of deriving the hubble constant within 2% accuracy @xcite .",
    "this is because one of the systematic error in hubble constant  the extinction is negligible in mir .",
    "also , the mir p - l relation is expected to be insensitive to metallicity . in this work",
    ", we test the assumption of metallicity independent of the irac band p - l relations : we apply statistical tests to test the correlations between the slopes of the synthetic p - l relation and metallicity .",
    "details of deriving the synthetic p - l relations from pulsation models are given in @xcite .",
    "the metallicity , @xmath0 , for each sets of irac band pl relations is known .",
    "we test the following relations between the metallicity and the synthetic irac band p - l slopes : * case ( i ) * the p - l slopes are independent of metallicity ; and * case ( ii ) * the p - l slopes are linearly depending on metallicity . figure [ label1 ] and [ label2 ] show the fitting of these two cases to the synthetic p - l slopes , respectively .",

    "we have applied the akaike s information criterion ( @xmath1 ) and schwarz s bayesian criterion ( @xmath2 ) , methods that widely used in statistical literature for models selection , to test the metallicity dependency of synthetic irac band p - l slopes .",

    "the @xmath2 show similar results as @xmath1 .",
    "hence , statistical tests on the possible metallicity dependency of theoretical irac band p - l slopes suggested that this dependency could be linear .",
    "the statistical tests suggested that the synthetic irac band p - l slopes are linearly depending on @xmath0 .",
    "however , this result contradicts to the expectation that the mir p - l relation should be independent of metallicity .",
    "empirical irac band pl slopes , based on the _ spitzer _ archival data , indicated that these p - l slopes may be metallicity independent @xcite .",
    "further works , both theoretically and empirically , need to verify or falsify the dependency of metallicity on irac band pl relations .",
