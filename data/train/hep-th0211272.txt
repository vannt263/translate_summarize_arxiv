    "string theory has been proposed as a unified theory of fundamental interactions including gravity .",
    "if it is the well - defined quantum gravity theory which our nature adopts , it should be able to predict several properties of our universe , for instance , the gauge symmetry at low energy , the particle content and their masses , and the dimensionality of our space - time .",
    "the last of these is the property we would like to investigate in this paper .",
    "as is well known , superstring theory has infinitely many vacua with various dimensionalities that arise perturbatively .",
    "one of the most promising scenarios to construct a realistic four - dimensional model from superstring theory is a compactification in which the ten - dimensional space - time consists of a flat four - dimensional space - time and a six - dimensional compact manifold that is small enough to be invisible to our experiments .",
    "there are several ways to realize this scenario , for example , calabi - yau compactification @xcite , fermionic construction @xcite , and so on , but they are all stable and there is no way to single out the true vacuum perturbatively . however , it has been revealed that this problem originates from perturbative formulations themselves , and to overcome this difficulty , we need a nonperturbative formulation and analysis of string theory .    in the mid-1990s , some models were presented as a constructive formulation of m - theory @xcite and certain kinds of superstring theories , such as type iia matrix string @xcite , type i superstring @xcite and heterotic superstring @xcite . here",
    "we would like to analyze the model called the ikkt model @xcite , which is conjectured to be a nonperturbative definition of type iib superstring theory .",
    "it seems to be most promising for nonperturbative analyses of superstring theory , and some kinds of extensions of this model have been proposed @xcite . for a review of the iib matrix model ,",
    "see ref . @xcite .",
    "also , there are some mechanisms proposed for dynamical breakdown of lorentz symmetry in this model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to analyse the iib matrix model ,",
    "we use a method that we call the `` improved mean field approximation '' ( imfa)@xcite .",
    "this approximation was applied to the large-@xmath0 reduced yang - mills models by oda and sugino @xcite .",
    "then , nishimura and sugino applied it to the iib matrix model in an excellent work @xcite .",
    "they obtained a result that suggests the breakdown of lorentz symmetry to the four - dimensional symmetry . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we analyzed how the imfa scheme works and discovered a general structure that we call the `` improved taylor expansion . ''",
    "furthermore , we proposed a principle for choosing the mean fields , that is , the existence of a `` plateau . ''",
    "the emergence of a plateau indicates that the approximation scheme works well and , in fact , its existence can be confirmed in some exactly solvable models .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for reference . there ,",
    "many examples are given which show how good this scheme is . )",
    "furthermore we developed a computational method using two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) graphs , which simplifies the calculation drastically .",
    "the 2pi free energy has a close relationship with the schwinger - dyson equation as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    using this method , we calculated the free energy up to 5th order and obtained a preliminary result which suggests that the eigenvalue distribution of the matrices preserves only the four - dimensional rotational symmetry .    in this paper ,",
    "we carry out a further calculation up to 7th order .",
    "we find evidence suggesting the emergence of a plateau , which was not clear at 5th order .",
    "in fact , we have evaluated the free energy and the extent of the eigenvalue distribution for various lorentz symmetries by introducing corresponding mean fields . in the case of so(4 ) symmetry , the number of extrema of the free energy increases as we go to higher orders , and it seems that they form a plateau .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvalues are widely distributed in the four `` non - compact '' directions , while they tend to gather in the six compact directions .",
    "one the other hand , if we impose so(7 ) symmetry , the number of extrema of the free energy does not grow enough to form a plateau , and the eigenvalues are distributed somewhat isotropically in the ten directions . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the other cases are reduced to the above two cases , or do not have a plateau at all .    we evaluate the 2738 graphs to obtain the free energy up to 7th order .",
    "all the calculations , including the generation and computation of the graphs , are totally automatized now , and we will be able to go further and find reliable results .    in  [ sec",
    ": imfa ] , we provide a short review of the improved mean field approximation with a @xmath1 matrix model as an example .",
    "we examine a distribution of extrema of the free energy of this model , which provides a method of the search for a plateau in the iib matrix model . in  [ sec : fofiibmm ] , we apply imfa to the iib matrix model . we obtain the free energy , investigate the distribution of its extrema to search for a plateau and examine the eigenvalue distributions .",
    "section [ sec : conlusion ] is devoted to a conclusion and discussion . in appendix",
    "[ sec : matrix_qed ] , we make use of a @xmath1-qed type matrix model to confirm our counting of the graphs .",
    "in this section , we review the improved mean field approximation that was developed in our previous paper @xcite . although all the techniques we introduce here are the same as those used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we explain them to make this paper self - contained and for reader s convenience .",
    "suppose we have some action function @xmath2 and its free energy @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the unperturbed part , which can be integrated analytically , and @xmath5 is difficult or impossible to integrate and is treated as a perturbation of @xmath6 .    in ordinary perturbation theory , we keep the unperturbed part in the exponential and expand the perturbation into a series .",
    "for convenience , we introduce a formal coupling constant @xmath7 and rewrite the action as @xmath8 .",
    "then we obtain the ordinary perturbation series for the free energy with respect to @xmath7 as follows : @xmath9 we can obtain the free energy up to order @xmath10 in the perturbation theory by truncating the infinite series up to order @xmath10 and setting @xmath11 .    in general",
    ", the perturbation series has a finite ( or maybe even zero ) convergence radius with respect to the parameters appearing in the action , for example , the inverse mass squared @xmath12 in @xmath6 . to see what happens and when the perturbation theory fails ,",
    "let us consider a zero - dimensional @xmath1 one - matrix model .",
    "the action of the zero dimensional @xmath1 matrix model is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an @xmath15 hermitian matrix . in the ordinary perturbation theory",
    ", we treat the quadratic part , @xmath16 , as the unperturbed action @xmath6 and the @xmath17 part as the perturbation @xmath18 . here , as an example , we consider the free energy . after introducing a formal coupling constant @xmath7 and expanding the exponential part with respect to it , we obtain @xmath19,\\ ] ] and we can estimate this series using the ordinary feynman diagram technique . here",
    "we consider the large-@xmath0 limit , where only planar graphs contribute to the free energy .",
    "thus , in the ordinary perturbation theory , the free energy is given by a series with respect to @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 on the other hand , one can evaluate this free energy exactly by analyzing the eigenvalue distribution @xcite , and it is known that the convergence radius of this series is @xmath22 . thus , after we set the formal coupling @xmath7 to 1 , this series converges when @xmath23 .",
    "this means that we can not calculate the free energy for the massless case , i.e. @xmath24 , as the limit of this perturbation series .",
    "because the iib matrix model of interest does not have a quadratic term , it corresponds to the massless case , in which the ordinary perturbation theory does not work .    to overcome this difficulty we introduce a new method , the improved mean field approximation , and",
    "obtain an improved perturbation series .",
    "when we apply the improved mean field approximation scheme , we first introduce a `` mean field '' @xmath25 which can be easily integrated , for instance , a quadratic term . here",
    ", @xmath26 is a set of parameters in the mean field , and we will tune it later to make the approximation better . then , we rewrite the original action as @xmath27 and we take @xmath28 as an unperturbed action and the part within parenthesis as the perturbation .",
    "we introduce a formal coupling constant @xmath7 as before .",
    "thus the action becomes @xmath29 , and the expansion of the exponential with respect to @xmath7 yields another perturbation series , which we call the improved perturbation series .",
    "finally , we tune the set of parameters @xmath26 to make the improved series converge , as we explain below .",
    "we call this procedure the `` improved mean field approximation . '' in particular ,",
    "if we consider the first order of this approximation for the free energy defined in ( [ f_phi4 ] ) , and tune the parameter @xmath26 using the condition @xmath30 , it is simply the ordinary mean field approximation .    as an example",
    ", we consider again the zero - dimensional @xmath1 matrix model .      in this case",
    ", we consider a quadratic term as the mean field : @xmath31 then , we construct a modified action , including a formal coupling @xmath7 , as @xmath32 we emphasize that we do not need to calculate graphs again . by comparing ( [ eq : mod_phi4 ] ) with the original action ( [ eq : ac_phi4 ] ) , we have only to substitute @xmath33 for the mass squared @xmath34 appearing in the ordinary perturbation theory .    therefore , by substituting @xmath35 for @xmath34 , and re - expanding with respect to @xmath7 , ( [ f_phi4 ] ) becomes @xmath36    in this form , the massless limit is no longer singular and can be taken simply by setting @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , from this form , we know how to calculate the improved perturbation series even for a massless theory , to which the ordinary perturbation theory can not be applied .",
    "first , we add a mass term @xmath37 to the original action by hand and calculate the free energy perturbatively",
    ". then we substitute @xmath38 for @xmath39 and re - expand it with respect to @xmath7 . finally , by setting @xmath11",
    ", we obtain the improved perturbation series for the massless theory . as we see , this prescription is useful for calculating the iib matrix model , which also has no quadratic term .    let us return to the case of a general value of @xmath34 .",
    "the final step of this prescription is to tune the parameter @xmath39 so that the improved series converges .",
    "to elucidate this situation , in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi4_m=2and4 ] , we plot the improved free energies with respect to @xmath34 at various orders for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that the improved series converges quite well in some domain .",
    "the position of the domain of the convergence depends on the choice of the parameter @xmath39 , for example , around @xmath24 for @xmath40 and around @xmath42 for @xmath43 . here",
    ", we have first plotted the improved series with respect to @xmath34 for various values of @xmath39 , and then determined the value of @xmath39 to make the series converge around the value of @xmath34 in question .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     c +   +    = 30em [ fig : extrema ]    c +   +    = 30em [ fig : ratio ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig : extrema ] and [ fig : ratio ] , these extrema and the ratios @xmath44 are plotted for each ansatz .    we find that these two ansatz yield significantly different behavior .",
    "the so(7 ) ansatz has fewer extrema than the so(4 ) ansatz , and , in particular , it has no extrema at even orders .",
    "therefore , we speculate that extrema for the so(7 ) ansatz do not accumulate to form a plateau .",
    "this means that the so(7 ) ansatz is not a realistic assumption for the eigenvalue distribution of the iib matrix model , and thus a seven - dimensional flat space - time would not be realized as its stable vacuum .",
    "even if the so(7 ) ansatz does develop a plateau at higher order , it would not be regarded as a compactification , because the ratio of the extents seems to be stabilized around 2 .    in contrast , the so(4 ) ansatz exhibits interesting behavior . in this case",
    ", the number of extrema grows as the order increases .",
    "it seems that even orders are not stable compared to odd orders .",
    "we observe similar situations in various models .",
    "actually , in the zero - dimensional @xmath1 model , even lower orders have no extrema , while odd orders develop a plateau even at lower orders @xcite .",
    "assuming this is the case , we ignore even orders",
    ". then we find peculiar behavior : there are two characteristic extrema that can be taken as the counterparts of the overshooting and undershooting extrema of the @xmath1 matrix model , and they are unrelated to a plateau .",
    "it seems that the other extrema tend to accumulate and can be expected to form a plateau .",
    "we further observe that the ratio of the extents for the so(4 ) ansatz are around 2 or 3 for these undershooting and overshooting extrema , whereas the other extrema have rather large ratios , around 6 - 9 .",
    "this implies that on the plateau , the ratio of the extents takes a large value . in short",
    ", we can conclude that the so(4 ) ansatz develops a plateau , and it predicts a quite large value for the ratio of the sizes of the internal and external directions .",
    "this indicates that our scenario for spontaneous compactification to a flat four - dimensional space - time is promising .",
    "we have performed the improved mean field approximation for the iib matrix model up to 7th order and obtained the following conclusions :    * we first conclude that the so(7 ) and so(4 ) ansatz exhibit different types of behavior , as described below . *",
    "the so(7 ) ansatz has fewer extrema than the so(4 ) ansatz , and it does not have a tendency to form a plateau . the eigenvalue distribution of the so(7 )",
    "ansatz is rather isotropic , and will not be realized as a compactification vacuum even if it has a plateau .",
    "* the so(4 ) ansatz has many extrema at higher orders and , except for the two special extrema mentioned below , it yields a quite large ratio of the extents of the four - dimensional space - time and that of the internal one . * the extrema of the so(4 ) ansatz are distributed , as in the @xmath1 matrix model , which develops a plateau .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix model has an overshooting and an undershooting extremum , which are located over and under the plateau , and the other extrema tend to accumulate .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the iib matrix model exhibits similar behavior and develops a plateau under the so(4 ) ansatz .    at this stage",
    "we do not have clear plateaus for any ansatz , and therefore we can not definitely tell which vacuum is realized in the iib matrix model . indeed , in order to do this , we need to identify the plateau for each ansatz , if such exists , and compare the values of the free energies at the plateaus . if an ansatz has no plateaus , we conclude that it is not realized as a vacuum .",
    "we expect that our so(4 ) ansatz is close to the true vacuum , which reproduces our universe , and it has a plateau where the free energy has the lowest value . in order to confirm this",
    ", we should analyze higher orders in the improved perturbation series .",
    "as mentioned above , our calculation is now totally automatized , and it seems possible to carry out further analysis with the help of supercomputers .",

    "in this appendix we consider a matrix model that has a @xmath1 type and a qed type interaction term .",
    "the action is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath15 matrices and @xmath47 is assumed to have flavor @xmath48 . as we discuss below ,",
    "we have introduced a source @xmath49 for @xmath46 in order to cancel the tadpole graphs .    by comparing this model with the iib matrix model with the mean field action ( [ iib_action_mod ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ phi4qed1 ] ) generates the same vacuum graphs with the same symmetry factors as the iib matrix model .",
    "these two models have the same types of propagators and vertices , except for the source term @xmath50 , which we explain below . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 play the roles of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , and @xmath48 should be set to @xmath55 , because @xmath47 is fermionic in the iib matrix model .",
    "however , we do not fix @xmath48 , in order to classify graphs via the number of @xmath47-loops .",
    "it is worth noting that in ( [ phi4qed1 ] ) there is no symmetry that forces the one - point function @xmath56 to vanish .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in the iib matrix model , where it can not have a non - zero value , due to the lorentz symmetry . in order to eliminate unwanted one - point functions from our model , we choose @xmath49 in such a way that @xmath57 order by order in the perturbation theory with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "our aim is to confirm that our list of the planar 2pi graphs of the iib matrix model is complete . for each graph , we read off the number of boson propagators ( b ) , fermion propagators ( f ) , fermion loops ( l ) , @xmath58 vertices ( v ) and @xmath59 vertices ( y ) , and we deduce the 2pi free energy of ( [ phi4qed1 ] ) as @xmath60 where the summation is taken over all possible planar 2pi graphs without tadpoles up to the given order of @xmath7 .",
    "note that in this expression cancellation between different graphs never occurs , because the symmetry factor is always positive .",
    "we compare this with the 2pi free energy of ( [ phi4qed1 ] ) in the large-@xmath0 limit , computed with a completely different method that we now explain .        for the purpose of computing the 2pi free energy of ( [ phi4qed2 ] ) , we first compute the two - point function @xmath63 in the large-@xmath0 limit , retrieve the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and integrate it with respect to @xmath51 to obtain the ordinary free energy .",
    "finally , we carry out its legendre transformation in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath64 to obtain the 2pi free energy .",
    "performing the gaussian integration in ( [ phi4qed2 ] ) with respect to @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath65 in order to compute the two - point function @xmath63 of this model , we start with the loop equation ( schwinger - dyson equation ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the orthogonal basis of hermitian @xmath68 matrices : @xmath69 . by defining @xmath70 this equation",
    "gives us the relation between these correlation functions , @xmath71 where we have used the factorization property in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "note that this equation holds even in the @xmath72 case if we ignore the first term on the right - hand side .",
    "the loop equation enables us to determine @xmath73 order by order in the perturbation theory as follows .",
    "first we expand each @xmath73 in terms of @xmath7 : @xmath74 substituting this into ( [ loopeq1 ] ) and comparing both sides to each order in @xmath7 , we obtain the following equation : @xmath75 because @xmath76 , we have the `` boundary condition '' @xmath77 .",
    "note that only the quantities @xmath78 with @xmath79 smaller than or equal to @xmath80 appear on the right - hand side and that when @xmath81 appears on the right - hand side , @xmath82 is always smaller than @xmath10 . because of this property , ( [ loopeq2 ] ) together with the boundary condition determines all the @xmath83 .",
    "once we determine @xmath84 up to a given order , for example , the 14th , corresponding to the 7th in the iib matrix model , we can tune @xmath49 order by order in such a way that @xmath84 vanishes for each @xmath80 . substituting the resulting expression for @xmath49 into @xmath85 , we can derive the two - point function up to the order we desire .",
    "because of this procedure , graphs containing a tadpole as a subgraph no longer contribute to @xmath85 , and therefore the free energy obtained by integrating @xmath86 gives the sum of all the planar vacuum graphs without tadpoles .",
    "once we have the free energy , it is easy to carry out the legendre transformation to obtain the 2pi free energy .",
    "we have compared the two forms of the 2pi free energy obtained using the two totally different methods and found complete agreement .",
    "this proves that our list of all planar 2pi graphs of the iib matrix model is complete .",
