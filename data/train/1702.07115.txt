    "the link @xmath4 is called the _ binding _ of the open book , and the closure of each fiber of @xmath6 in @xmath0 is called a _ page _ of the open book .",

    "the _ open book genus _ of a @xmath13-manifold @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath14 , is the minimum genus over all heegaard splittings of @xmath0 induced by open book decompositions .",
    "it immediately follows from the definition that @xmath15 for any 3-manifold @xmath0 , where @xmath16 is the heegaard genus of @xmath0 .",
    "a heegaard splitting is not necessarily induced by an open book decomposition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 does not necessarily equal @xmath16 . for example , `` most '' 3-manifolds of heegaard genus 2 have greater open book genus @xcite .",
    "we also have the following classification of @xmath13-manifolds with open book genus 0 and 1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a 3-manifold .",
    "then @xmath17 if and only if @xmath18 , and @xmath19 if and only if @xmath20 for some integer @xmath21 .",
    "a well - known corollary of haken s lemma is that the heegaard genus is additive under the connected sum of 3-manifolds .",
    "the following conjecture is stated by ozbagci @xcite .",
    "[ conj ] the open book genus is additive under the connected sum of 3-manifolds .    for @xmath22 , proving that @xmath23 is straightforward . for @xmath24 ,",

    "it follows that @xmath30 .",
    "since a plumbing of the open books induces a heegaard splitting of genus @xmath31 for @xmath0 , we get @xmath32 however , it is still unknown whether the @xmath33 is super - additive , equivalently additive , or not . in this paper , we prove that there can not be a counter - example to the conjecture [ conj ] such that the connected sum has open book genus 2 .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following .",
    "[ non - prime ] a non - prime 3-manifold @xmath0 has open book genus 2 if and only if each non - trivial connected summand of @xmath0 has open book genus 1 , that is , @xmath34 for some integers @xmath2 .",
    "an open book decomposition induces a genus 2 heegaard splitting if and only if it has pages of euler characteristic @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the pages are either once - punctured tori or pairs of pants .",
    "we will use different tools to deal with each case . in section 1 ,",
    "we recall the fact that a 3-manifold that has an open book decomposition with once - punctured torus pages is a double branced cover of @xmath36 along a 3-braid link , and we list some known facts about double branched covers and braid closures . in section 2 , we analyze 3-manifolds which possess open book decompositions with pair of pants pages .",
    "we argue that if such a manifold is not prime , then the open book decomposition should be  simple \" .",
    "our tool in section 2 is the theory of seifert fibered spaces . finally , we prove theorem [ non - prime ] in section 3 .",
    "note that the author of @xcite refers to the open book genus as the _ contact genus _ to draw attention to the strong relation between open book decompositions and contact structures , namely the giroux correspondence .",
    "however , we do not benefit from this relation and use classical tools from 3-manifolds topology .    * acknowledgements . *",
    "the author is grateful to tao li for numerous helpful discussions .",
    "he also would like to thank kyle hayden and mike miller for pointing out useful facts from knot theory .",
    "in this section , we recollect useful facts from classical knot theory .",
    "let us denote the double branched cover of @xmath36 along a link @xmath37 by @xmath38 .",
    "see @xcite for definition and details .",
    "the topology of @xmath38 is strongly related to properties of @xmath37 .",
    "it is known that every link @xmath37 can be represented as a braid closure @xcite .",
    "the minimum number of strands required to represent @xmath37 as a braid closure is called the _ braid index _ of @xmath37 , denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "assume that @xmath37 is represented as a braid closure along @xmath40 strands with braid axis @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath41 is the unknot , it is the binding of an open book decomposition @xmath42 of @xmath36 , where @xmath43 is the projection map @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the open disk @xmath46 and @xmath47 the branched covering map .",
    "define @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that @xmath6 is a fibration with fibers @xmath50 realizing @xmath48 as boundary , i.e. , @xmath3 is an open book decomposition of @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the braid representation of @xmath37 on @xmath40 strands intersects each page @xmath45 in @xmath40 points , and @xmath51 is a double branched cover of @xmath45 along these @xmath40 points . in other words ,",
    "the pages of @xmath3 are homeomorphic to a surface @xmath7 , which is a double branched cover of @xmath52 along @xmath40 points .",
    "it follows that @xmath53 , and hence the induced open book decomposition @xmath3 of @xmath38 induces a heegaard splitting of genus @xmath54 .",
    "this proves the following .",
    "[ bound ] if @xmath37 is a link in @xmath36 with @xmath55 , then @xmath56 .",
    "since the braid index of a link @xmath37 suggests an upper bound for the open book genus of @xmath38 , it is worth stating the following result concerning the additivity of the braid index under connected sum .",
    "[ additive ] the braid index is minus one additive under the connected sum operation , that is , @xmath57 .    in the discussion above ,",
    "since @xmath7 is a double branched cover of @xmath52 along @xmath40 points , it is a compact genus @xmath58 surface with @xmath59 boundary components , where @xmath60 in particular , if @xmath37 is a 3-braid ( respectively 2-braid ) link , then @xmath38 has an open book decomposition with once - punctured torus ( respectively annulus ) pages . on the other hand ,",
    "any 3-manifold @xmath0 that has an open book with once - punctured torus pages is homeomorphic to @xmath38 for some 3-braid link @xmath37 ( see @xcite , section 2 ) .",
    "thus , we have the following .    [ 3-braid ]",
    "a 3-manifold @xmath0 has an open book decomposition with once - punctured torus pages if and only if it is homeomorphic to a double branched cover of @xmath36 along a 3-braid link @xmath37 .",
    "this statement does not generalize for @xmath40-braid links when @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , there are open book decompositions with connected bindings which are not obtained as double branched covers along braids .",
    "this can be argued more carefully , but we simply note that every 3-manifold has an open book with connected binding , whereas there are 3-manifolds , e.g. @xmath62 , which are not double branched covers of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we can say more about the topology of @xmath38 looking at the link @xmath37 .",
    "for example , it is known that @xmath63 because a sphere @xmath64 that realizes the connected sum @xmath65 in @xmath36 lifts to a sphere in @xmath66 that realizes the connected sum @xmath67 .",
    "it is also known that @xmath68 if and only if @xmath37 is the unknot @xcite .",
    "these two facts imply that @xmath38 is a non - prime manifold whenever @xmath37 is a composite link since if @xmath69 for non - trivial links @xmath70 , then @xmath71 for non - trivial 3-manifolds",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "[ prime ] a ( non - split ) link @xmath37 is prime if and only if @xmath38 is prime .",
    "we can define open book decompositions in an abstract way .",
    "let @xmath7 be a compact surface with boundary and @xmath73 an orientation - preserving self - homeomorphism of @xmath7 , called a _ monodromy _",
    ", such that @xmath74 is the identity map .",
    "take the mapping torus @xmath75 and perform _ vertical _ dehn fillings on @xmath76 , i.e. , glue a solid torus @xmath77 to each torus component of @xmath78 via a homeomorphism identifying a meridian @xmath79 to @xmath80 for some @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting space forms a 3-manifold @xmath0 with an embedded open book decomposition such that the binding is the cores of the glued solid tori , and the pages are homeomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "the pair @xmath82 is called an _ abstract open book decomposition _ of @xmath0 .",
    "every embedded open book decomposition of a 3-manifold @xmath0 can be viewed as an abstract open book decompostion as well @xcite .",
    "we use the notation @xmath83 . note that isotoping or conjugating @xmath73 does not change the homeomorphism type of @xmath0 .",
    "an abstract open book decomposition @xmath82 of a 3-manifold @xmath0 defines an extrinsic heegaard splitting for @xmath0 .",
    "namely , we take two copies of the handlebody @xmath10 and glue them along their boundaries @xmath84 via the homeomorphism @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath51 denotes @xmath89 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "when we glue @xmath90 s via the @xmath91 map , we obtain the trivial interval bundle over @xmath7 .",
    "then , gluing @xmath92 s via @xmath73 , we obtain the mapping torus @xmath75 .",
    "finally , vertical dehn fillings on @xmath76 can be recovered by identifying @xmath93 s via the identity map .",
    "hence , the open book decomposition and the heegaard splitting form homeomorphic 3-manifolds .",
    "some 3-manifolds with open book genus 2 can be obtained as abstract open book decompositions with pages homeomorphic to a pair of pants @xmath94 .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath95 of @xmath94 is homomorphic to @xmath96 , where the generators are the dehn twists @xmath97 about the curves @xmath98 in figure [ pop ] .",
    "therefore , any given monodoromy @xmath73 of @xmath94 can be written as a product of powers of @xmath97 up to isotopy , that is , @xmath73 can be taken to be @xmath99 for some integers @xmath100 . in this section",
    ", we will argue that possible values of @xmath100 are pretty restricted if the 3-manifold @xmath101 is not prime .",
    "[ sfs ] if no @xmath100 equals 0 , then @xmath101 is a seifert fibered space .",
    "apparently , this lemma is known to experts ( see @xcite ) , however , the author could not find a proof in the literature .",
    "we present a proof here .",

    "for @xmath104 , let @xmath105 be an embedded curve in @xmath94 so that @xmath105 and @xmath106 bound an annulus @xmath107 with core @xmath98 .",
    "finally , let @xmath108 be a spanning arc for @xmath107 , and @xmath109 the endpoint of @xmath108 on @xmath106 as in figure [ pieces ] .",
    "when we remove the annuli @xmath107 from @xmath94 , we obtain another pair of pants @xmath110 .",
    "notice that @xmath111 is the identity map , and so @xmath112 is embedded in the mapping torus @xmath75 .",
    "we will analyze how the vertical dehn fillings on the boundary components @xmath113 of @xmath75 are realized on the boundary components @xmath114 of @xmath112 .",

    "in other words , @xmath25 is the mapping torus of the monodromy @xmath117 on the annulus @xmath107 , where @xmath97 is the dehn twist about @xmath98 .    _ claim .",
    "_ there is a properly embedded annulus @xmath118 in @xmath25 such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 is an @xmath121-curve on the torus @xmath114 .    _",
    "proof of the claim .",
    "_ take the rectangle @xmath122 in @xmath123 , and let @xmath124 be the vertex @xmath125 of @xmath126 .",

    "we show @xmath126 before rotation , and in figure [ piecesb ] , we depict @xmath128 after rotation in the @xmath129 case . in particular , @xmath130 is the image of @xmath108 under the monodromy @xmath117 , and @xmath131 is the @xmath108 itself .",
    "since @xmath25 is obtained from @xmath123 by identifying @xmath132 with @xmath133 , then @xmath126 turns into a properly embedded annulus @xmath118 in @xmath25 . by construction ,",
    "the boundary of @xmath118 on @xmath113 is @xmath134 , and the boundary of @xmath118 on @xmath114 is an @xmath121-curve .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim .    0.5       0.5    now , when we perform vertical dehn fillings on @xmath76 , we glue a solid torus @xmath77 to each boundary component @xmath113 by attaching a meridional disk @xmath135 of the solid torus to @xmath134 . on the boundary component @xmath114 of @xmath112 ,",
    "this is realized as attaching the disk @xmath136 to the non - infinity slope @xmath121 .",
    "since the result of dehn fillings along non - infinity slopes @xmath121 on the components @xmath114 of @xmath137 is the seifert fibered space @xmath138 , the result follows .",
