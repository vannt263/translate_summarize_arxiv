    ", one can systematically examine strong - coupling effects by adjusting the interaction strength .",
    "while there exist various similarities between a superfluid fermi gas and metallic superconductivity , the presence of a trap potential is peculiar to the former . because of this confined geometry , physical quantities naturally become inhomogeneous . thus , when an experiment has no spatial resolution , it gives spatially averaged data .",

    "then , in a trapped superfluid fermi gas , we can expect the inhomogeneous situation that while the bcs - type superfluid density of states appears in the trap center , the pseudogap is still dominant in the outer region of the gas cloud ( where the superfluid order parameter is small and pairing fluctuations are strong ) .    to confirm such a shell structure , it is convenient to examine the superfluid local density of states ( ldos ) , as well as the local spectral weight ( lsw ) . in this paper , using a combined @xmath1-matrix theory with the local density approximation ( lda ) , we identify the pseudogap region in the phase diagram with respect to the interaction strength , temperature , and spatial position .",

    "this is consistent with the statement@xcite that the observed pressure in the unitarity limit can be well described by the fermi liquid theory . since the pressure is not directly related to the detailed single - particle excitations compared with the photoemission spectrum , it is possible to occur that , while the pseudogap can be observed in the latter , such a strong - coupling phenomenon does not clearly appear in the former thermodynamic quantity .    in this paper",
