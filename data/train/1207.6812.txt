    "<S> we assess the theoretical uncertainties on the inclusive @xmath0 production cross section in the color evaporation model ( cem ) using values for the charm quark mass , renormalization and factorization scales obtained from a fit to the charm production data . </S>",

    "<S> quarkonium , cold nuclear matter    because the charm quark mass is finite , the total charm production cross section can be calculated in perturbative qcd . however , there are large uncertainties due to the choice of quark mass , factorization scale and renormalization scale @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . typical lower limits of the factorization and renormalization scales are half the chosen charm quark mass @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the factorization scale is below the minimum scale of the parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for renormalization scales below 1 gev , the strong coupling constant @xmath1 becomes large and the perturbative expansion is unlikely to converge . </S>",
    "<S> thus we seek a set of physically defensible mass and scale parameters that reduce the cross section uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath0 cross sections are calculated with the same set of mass and scale parameters as open charm production in the color evaporation model @xcite , we also place limits on the @xmath0 cross section calculated in the cem for the first time . </S>",

    "<S> the limit on the width of the uncertainty band is now set by the uncertainty due to bottom quark production and decay .    </S>",
