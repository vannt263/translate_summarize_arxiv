    "a new generation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) mapping experiments is beginning to produce data of unprecedented quality ( see e.g. , torbet et al .  1999 ; miller et al .  1999 ; debernardis et al .  2000 ; hanany et al .  2000 ,",
    "hereafter h00 ) .",
    "much of the experimental effort is concentrated on probing angular scales of about 10 arcminutes . to fully benefit from the scientific potential of these high resolution data sets , a new level of sophistication",
    "is required in quantifying all possible sources of error in the experimental procedure and data analysis pipeline ( e.g. , ferreira & jaffe 2000 ) .",
    "particular care must be used to accurately quantify the instrument response to the signal and to include such response in the data analysis .    in all analyses of cmb data",
    "so far the experimental beam has been assumed to have a radial symmetry .",
    "this assumption has been incorporated in most map - making and angular power spectrum ( @xmath0 ) estimation algorithms ( e.g. , bond , jaffe , & knox 1998 ) and is necessary because of limitations in computing capability .",
    "a crude symmetric - beam approximation was adequate in the past since most of the error budget was dominated by statistical and other systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , with the precision of current and future analyses , it becomes essential to establish a methodology for accurately quantifying the degree of beam - asymmetry and properly incorporating it into the data analysis pipeline .",
    "if the beam is incorrectly incorporated in the data analysis pipeline , one may not only artificially distort the underlying structure of the measured cmb signal but also bias the estimate of the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "in this paper we present a new formalism for estimating the power spectrum that can handle any beam shape .",
    "we show that the formalism can be applied to a broad variety of cases which encompass most practical applications . as a consequence , the detailed shape of the antenna beam",
    "should no longer pose a limitation in measuring the angular power spectrum of cmb experiments .",
    "the asymmetry of beams may arise from a variety of sources .",
    "for example , it may be due to the optics , or due to the finite response time of a detector which leaves imprints in the direction of the scan ( e.g. , hanany , jaffe , & scannapieco 1998 ) .",
    "regardless of the origins of the asymmetry , the framework we shall present is general , and consists of finding an equivalent symmetric beam that replaces the asymmetric beam in the analysis of the data .",
    "using the formalism one can assess the degree of asymmetry of a beam ( see eq .  [ [ varpi_l ] ] ) , how the asymmetry propagates through the analysis pipeline , and how to find an azimuthally symmetrized beam that best approximates the asymmetric beam ( see e.g. , eq .  [ [ bl2eff_avg4 ] ] ) .",
    "the symmetrized beam is then used in the symmetric - beam approximation of the @xmath0 estimation ( see eq .",
    "[ [ cbbb_app3 ] ] ) .",
    "the formalism quantifies the errors introduced in the @xmath0 estimates because of the use of the symmetrized - beam approximation , the uncertainty in the final @xmath0 estimates resulting from the uncertainty in the beam measurement ( see eq .",
    "[ [ delta_cl ] ] ) , and the smoothing effects due to the pixelization of the map ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ bl2_effx ] ] and [ [ bl2_effxapp ] ] )",
    ". it also shows how to combine beams from independent experimental photometers ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ w_l ] ] , [ [ barbplm2 ] ] , [ [ chi_t ] ] , and [ [ mu_t ] ] ) .",
    "some useful conditions under which this new formalism will be needed are also provided ( see eqs .  [ [ clmid_constraint ] ] and [ [ cl2mid_constraint ] ] ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ the_convention ]",
    ", we describe the framework of cmb data analysis for the estimation of the power spectrum , so as to illustrate the problems related to asymmetric beams . in section  [ the_criteria_for_beam_symmetry ] , we define the ` index of asymmetry ' ( ioa ) @xmath1 , a useful parameter in quantifying the level of asymmetry of a beam .",
    "similarly , we define the ` index of combined asymmetry ' ( ioca ) @xmath2 , which is useful when combining data from photometers of different beam shapes . in sections  [ the_effective_bl_of_pixels ] and [ the_effective_two_point_bl ]",
    ", we investigate the problems associated with asymmetric beams .",
    "we introduce the ` average pixel - beam expansion ' , @xmath3 , and the ` pixel - pixel beam expansion ' , @xmath4 , to provide an approximation scheme where the convolution effect of asymmetric beams is treated as circularly symmetric .",
    "the biasing effects of this approximation in the resulting estimated power spectrum @xmath0 are also considered . in section  [ symmetry_vs_asymmetry ] , we derive the conditions under which one needs to employ the new formalism for treating asymmetric beams . in section  [ uncertainties_from_beam_measurement ] , we investigate the uncertainties in the @xmath0 estimates resulting from the uncertainties in the measurement of beam shape . in section",
    "[ deconvolution_of_the_pixel_smoothing ] , we discuss another convolution effect due to the pixelization of the cmb map .",
    "although this is not a beam - related issue , we demonstrate a simple way to incorporate its treatment into our framework . in section  [ numerical_verifications ] , we numerically verify certain key points developed in sections  [ the_criteria_for_beam_symmetry ] to [ deconvolution_of_the_pixel_smoothing ] , as well as the accuracy of the proposed approximation in treating asymmetric beams .",
    "in particular , we use the data from the maxima-1 experiment as an example to demonstrate the generic treatment of asymmetric beams in cmb experiments .",
    "it is shown that our formalism has no biasing effects in the resulting @xmath0 estimates . finally in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize the procedure in applying our formalism to experiments , discuss its availability , and draw a conclusion .",
    "we first consider the standard procedure for the power spectrum estimation .",
    "this consists of two main steps .",
    "first , one estimates the pixelized map @xmath5 from a given time - stream @xmath6 , i.e. , to translate the observation from the temporal ( @xmath7 ) to the spatial ( @xmath8 ) domain .",
    "second , one estimates the power spectrum @xmath0 from the map @xmath5 .    in the temporal domain , what we observe is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cmb signal and @xmath11 is the instrumental noise .",
    "traditionally we model the cmb observation as @xmath12 where we use the einstein summation convention here and below when appropriate ( usually over pixels and time samples , but not over spherical harmonic indices ) . here",
    "@xmath13 is the pointing matrix giving the weight of pixel @xmath8 in observation @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is the cmb signal on the pixel convolved by a pixel beam @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the spherical harmonics , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the multipole expansions of @xmath20 and the cmb signal respectively .",
    "note that we use a two - dimensional vector @xmath21 to denote locations on the surface of the sphere , which we shall often consider in the small - field limit ( see later ) .",
    "we usually take the pointing operator @xmath13 to be one when observing pixel @xmath8 at time @xmath7 and zero otherwise .",
    "that is , we model the signal @xmath10 to be the same for any observation within pixel @xmath8 . in effect , we take the sky to be smoothed with a top - hat of shape given by the pixel boundary .",
    "we shall see in section  [ deconvolution_of_the_pixel_smoothing ] that , as expected , this is equivalent to an extra convolution included in @xmath22 .    with this modeling , one can thus estimate the pixelized map from the temporal data .",
    "this involves maximizing the likelihood of the signal given the data : @xmath23 =     ( 2\\pi)^{-{\\cal n}_t/2 } \\times \\nonumber\\\\    \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2 }    \\left ( n^t n^{-1 }",
    "n + tr[\\ln n ] \\right )    \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , all as defined in equations ( [ d_t ] ) and ( [ gamma_t ] ) , @xmath27 is the size of the time - stream , and @xmath28 is the time - time noise correlation matrix . here",
    "we have assumed that the noise is gaussian and that all cmb maps are a priori equally likely .",
    "maximizing over @xmath29 gives @xmath30 where @xmath31 as defined in equation ( [ gamma_t ] ) and @xmath32 is the noise in the pixel domain .",
    "one then moves on to estimate the power spectrum of the map , @xmath33 .",
    "this requires the maximization of the likelihood function @xmath34 =     ( 2\\pi)^{-{\\cal n}_{c_\\ell}/2 } \\times \\nonumber\\\\    \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(m^t m^{-1 } m + tr[\\ln m]\\right)\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the dimension of the parameter space of @xmath0 , and @xmath36 with @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the pixel - pixel cmb signal correlation matrix , and @xmath39 is the pixel - pixel noise correlation matrix .",
    "we note first that in the estimation of @xmath0 , although there exists methods like the quadratic estimator ( bond et al .",
    "1998 ) which avoid a direct evaluation of equation ( [ l ] ) , the relationship between the beam expansion @xmath18 and the power spectrum @xmath0 remains the same and is illustrated in equation ( [ clbb ] ) .",
    "second , if the beam is identical for all pixels and circularly symmetric , i.e. , @xmath40 , then equation ( [ clbb ] ) can be greatly simplified as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the legendre function and @xmath43 is the angular distance between the pixels .    generally it is impractical to estimate @xmath0 for all @xmath44 due to the constraints of finite sky coverage and computation power .",
    "instead , one divides the accessible @xmath44-range constrained by the sky coverage and the observing beam size into several bands @xmath45 , and then estimates the band power @xmath46 , i.e. , one approximates @xmath0 in the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a chosen shape function characterizing the scale dependence in each band .",
    "for example , one can choose @xmath49 which leads to a scale - invariant form in each @xmath44 band , i.e. , @xmath50 . with the approximation ( [ clcsh ] )",
    ", one can rewrite equation ( [ clbb ] ) as @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52    =     \\sum_{\\ell\\in b }        \\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell }           c_\\ell^{\\rm sh } \\times    \\nonumber\\\\           b_{p\\ell m}b^*_{p'\\ell m }             y_{\\ell m}({\\bf x}_p)y^*_{\\ell m}({\\bf x}_{p ' } ) .",

    "\\label{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the analysis procedure outlined above , the first problem arises in equations ( [ gamma_t ] ) and ( [ s_p ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , what is convolved in reality is not the pixel temperature in @xmath14 itself but the cmb signal in the time - stream @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the multipole expansion of the time - stream beam @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the experiment gives us a beam which moves on the sky as a function of time , @xmath7 , and indeed may observe a different signal within the same pixel , @xmath8 , depending on the orientation of the beam and the location of its center .",
    "we thus make a map which may have many different beams contributing to a single pixel .",
    "however , in our analysis formalism we must actually express this map as in ( [ s_p ] ) , an observation of the sky with only a single pixel beam , @xmath58 .",
    "hence , for the @xmath0 estimation , we need to find a way to estimate the pixel - beam expansion @xmath18 from the @xmath56 , and this will be the focus of sections  [ the_effective_bl_of_pixels ] and [ deconvolution_of_the_pixel_smoothing ]",
    ".    the second problem appears in equation ( [ cbbb_app1 ] ) .",
    "if the beam is not symmetric , the summation over @xmath59 and the dependence on the pixel pair make the exact computation prohibitively expensive . to resolve this problem , in section  [ the_effective_two_point_bl ] we introduce the pixel - pixel beam expansion @xmath4 , which provides a consistent way to symmetrize asymmetric beams .",
    "this @xmath4 then replaces the @xmath60 in equation ( [ cbbb_app2 ] ) , so as to approximate equation ( [ cbbb_app1 ] ) .    on general grounds ,",
    "the size of the observing beam is so small that , when necessary , we shall use the flat sky approximation under the small - field limit .",
    "this means that when the size of a spherical patch is sufficiently small , the expansion of the beam in spherical harmonics is equivalent to a fourier transform on a flat two - dimensional patch , i.e. , @xmath61 and @xmath62 throughout the paper , we shall use a ` tilde ' to denote the fourier transform of a quantity .",
    "it is important to clearly define the level of asymmetry of an antenna beam . consider the multipole expansion @xmath63 of the beam . for a given @xmath44 , the variance of @xmath63 about its mean over @xmath59 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean of squares over @xmath59 :",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 is the square of the mean over @xmath59 : @xmath68 ^ 2    = \\langle b_{\\ell m}\\rangle^2.\\ ] ] here @xmath69 is the mean of @xmath63 over @xmath59 , and therefore can be either positive or negative .",
    "we also note that @xmath65 is the power spectrum of the asymmetric beam , and that @xmath67 is equivalent to the power spectrum of a symmetric beam that is azimuthally averaged in the real space . based on this",
    ", one can define an ` index of asymmetry ' ( ioa ) as @xmath70^{1/2}.\\ ] ] we see that @xmath1 varies from zero to one  the larger the @xmath1 , the more asymmetric the beam .",
    "we also note that if the beam is symmetric , then @xmath1 is exactly zero .",
    "thus for a given beam , @xmath1 provides us an objective measure of the level of its asymmetry .    in certain situations , we need to combine data from two or more photometers with different beam shapes .",
    "we shall use a subscript @xmath71 ( @xmath72 , etc . ) to denote the quantities obtained from different photometers . as an analog to equation ( [ varpi_l ] )",
    ", it proves useful to define an ` index of combined asymmetry ' ( ioca ) for all the beams as @xmath73^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath74^{2 } ,    \\label{bism2}\\\\    b_{\\sigma\\ell{\\rm ( ms)}}^2 & = &   \\left [    \\sum_i \\zeta_i \\sqrt{b_{i\\ell{\\rm ( ms)}}^2 }   \\right]^{2 } ,   \\label{bims2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the @xmath69 and @xmath65 of photometer @xmath71 respectively , @xmath77},\\ ] ] @xmath78 is the total observation time of photometer @xmath71 , and @xmath79 is its noise equivalent temperature ( net ) . here",
    "@xmath80 is the square of the noise - weighted mean of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the noise - weighted mean of the squares of @xmath81 assuming all the @xmath81 are fully correlated .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath2 varies between zero and one  the larger the @xmath2 , the more asymmetric a @xmath83-weighted combined beam can be ( depending on the detailed orientations of the beams in the temporal samples ; we shall discuss this later ) .",
    "this also means that the ioa ( @xmath1 ) of an average beam with a weight @xmath83 for each @xmath81 is always equal to or smaller than @xmath2 , although the individual @xmath84 of @xmath81 may be larger than @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath85 , then we know that all the beams are symmetric ( @xmath86 ) , and vice versa .    for the purpose of power spectrum estimation , one can employ @xmath84 ( or @xmath2 when combining data of different observing beams ) to decide if a simple symmetric - beam approximation is sufficient .",
    "for example , at @xmath44 s where @xmath87 , we expect equation ( [ cbbb_app2 ] ) to be adequate . on the other hand , at @xmath44 s where @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) deviates significantly from zero , one may need to employ equation ( [ cbbb_app1 ] ) .",
    "we shall further discuss these situations , and the use of the ioa ( @xmath1 ) and the ioca ( @xmath2 ) later .",
    "we first estimate the ` pixel - beam expansion ' , @xmath18 , from given observing beams , @xmath56 . a naive way to investigate this is to substitute equations ( [ s_p ] ) and ( [ gamma_t2 ] ) into the model ( [ gamma_t ] ) , leading to @xmath88 this equation holds if and only if there exists one @xmath89 for every @xmath90 such that @xmath91 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath92 .",
    "this is of course true when the pixel size is infinitesimal , but is unlikely to be fulfilled in reality .",
    "nevertheless , equation ( [ eq : xpxt ] ) is just the result of the modeling and therefore not necessarily a requirement in practice . in our formalism for the power spectrum estimation",
    ", the @xmath14 is an unknown quantity to be estimated by using equation ( [ m ] ) , so the actual relation between @xmath18 and @xmath56 should be also obtained through the same process .",
    "first , we substitute equation ( [ d_t ] ) into ( [ m ] ) , and the cmb signal part yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 as defined in equation ( [ cn ] ) .",
    "further substituting equations ( [ s_p ] ) and ( [ gamma_t2 ] ) into this result , we obtain @xmath95 this equation is completely general , and should be in principle satisfied when one tries to find the @xmath18 from the given @xmath56 .",
    "we thus see that equation ( [ eq : xpxt ] ) is just one of the solutions to equation ( [ bplmy0 ] ) , but not necessarily a requirement for the purpose of power spectrum estimation .    in most cases ,",
    "the noise @xmath11 in each temporal measure is nearly independent from the others , so the time - time noise correlation matrix @xmath96 is diagonal , with the @xmath97 elements equal to the noise variance at each time sample , i.e. , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the standard deviation of time sample @xmath7 , and @xmath100 is a dirac delta .",
    "this allows us to simplify equation ( [ bplmy0 ] ) as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the noise - estimated statistical weight at @xmath7 : @xmath103 for simplicity , we shall take this white - noise assumption for further investigation .",
    "we consider the more general case of correlated noise in the appendix , and show that this white - noise approximation is appropriate in most practical cases .",
    "the conditions for the use of this white - noise assumption will be also derived in the appendix ( see eq .",
    "[ [ white - noise - cond ] ] ) .    to further simplify equation ( [ bplmy ] ) , we assume that @xmath104 @xmath105 ( i.e. , the temporal measure @xmath10 is thought of as a ` sample ' of the pixel temperature @xmath14",
    "; see eq .",
    "[ [ sp ] ] ) , so that the pixel - beam expansion can now be obtained as @xmath106 the assumption , @xmath104 , for achieving this result will be relaxed in section  [ deconvolution_of_the_pixel_smoothing ] , where we show that only an extra correction is required .",
    "as will be shown , it proves useful to remove the pixel dependence of @xmath18 in the formalism of the @xmath0 estimation .",
    "we thus consider the noise - weighted average of @xmath18 over all pixels ( c.f .",
    "[ [ m ] ] ) : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a contraction vector with entries all equal to unity , and @xmath109 we shall call @xmath3 the ` average pixel - beam expansion ' .",
    "we note that the subscript @xmath8 in @xmath3 does not mean the pixel dependence as in the usual convention , but indicates that this is a mean taken over all pixels .    with the white - noise assumption ( eq .  [ [ white - noise ] ] )",
    ", the @xmath3 can be calculated explicitly by substituting equation ( [ bplm ] ) into equation ( [ barbplm00 ] ) : @xmath110 where @xmath111 if the data are from a single photometer with a constant noise level , then equation ( [ barbplm2 ] ) reduces to a simple linear average of all time - stream beams .",
    "if the data are combined from different photometers , then the @xmath99 can be approximated as ( c.f .",
    ".  [ [ zeta ] ] ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the net of the corresponding photometer at time @xmath7 , and @xmath114 is the integration time of the temporal observation at @xmath7 . if the integration time remains unchanged among photometers , then the @xmath99 in equation ( [ chi_t ] )",
    "can be simply taken as the net of the corresponding photometer .",
    "we also note that with the definition ( [ mu_t ] ) , equations ( [ zeta ] ) and ( [ chi_t ] ) can be related as @xmath115 meaning that @xmath83 is the total noise - estimated weight of photometer @xmath71 .",
    "we note that in cases where both the shape of the experimental beam and its orientation relative to the pixel are roughly constant throughout the observation , we have a reasonable approximation ( see eq .  [ [ barbplm2 ] ] ) : @xmath116 in other cases , equation ( [ barbplm2 ] ) will need to be employed , for example , when the relative orientation between the asymmetric beam and the pixels changes , or when data from different photometers are combined together .",
    "we also note that even if all the beams @xmath81 of different photometers are symmetric ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) , the @xmath118 may still have pixel dependence due to the various relative contribution of @xmath81 within different pixels ( see eq .  [ [ bplm ] ] ) . in such cases",
    ", one will need to consider equation ( [ barbplm2 ] ) , and a simple formalism like equation ( [ cbbb_app2 ] ) will be invalid for the estimation of the cmb angular power spectrum , since the @xmath119 is different on each pixel . as will be shown ,",
    "the formalism we shall develop is also capable of dealing with this situation .",
    "we now derive useful constraints on the magnitude of the average pixel - beam expansion @xmath3 . in the small - field limit",

    "we first consider single - photometer experiments . in this case , if the beam pattern remains the same throughout the entire observation but with only different orientations at different @xmath7 , then we can rewrite @xmath124 as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the rotation matrix , @xmath127 is the rotation angle at time @xmath7 with respect to @xmath128 , and @xmath129 is the shape of the time - stream beam at @xmath128 . substituting this into equation ( [ bl2eff_2 ] ) gives @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the weighting function of a rotation angle @xmath132 , and satisfies @xmath133 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the function @xmath131 that minimizes the right hand side of the above equation is @xmath134 , leading to @xmath135 ^ 2    \\equiv    b_{0\\ell{\\rm ( sm)}}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is as defined in equation ( [ b2lsm ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "these results tell us that when the pixels are scanned almost uniformly in all directions , then the resulting @xmath141 should be closer to @xmath142 .",
    "when the pixels are scanned with an almost fixed direction , then the resulting @xmath141 should be closer to @xmath143 .",

    "it is obtained directly by varying the beam shape with @xmath249 .",

    "this means , first , that the asymmetry of the beam does not affect our result given by equation ( [ delta_cl ] ) .",
    "second , the banding of @xmath44 does not affect the result , so we can use equation ( [ delta_cl ] ) as an estimate for the uncertainty in the band power @xmath46 resulting from that in the beam measurement .",

    "the resulting errors in the @xmath0 estimates by taking @xmath385 is quantified by equation ( [ clmid_constraint ] ) .",

    "we note that equation ( [ barbplm2 ] ) also works for combining data sets from different photometers with different beam shapes , as long as the noise level @xmath99 is well taken into account .",
    "one then calculates the power spectrum @xmath388 of @xmath3 ( see eq .",

    "in addition , we derived the conditions under which one needs to employ this formalism to account for the asymmetry of beams .",
    "we demonstrated certain key points by using a simulated highly elliptic beam , and the beams and data of the maxima-1 experiment , where the asymmetry is mild .",
    "in particular , we showed that in both cases the formalism does not bias the final @xmath0 estimates .    in spite of the power of the new formalism in dealing with various practical situations where the beams are not symmetric",

    "[ [ bl2eff_avg2 ] ] and [ [ bl2eff_avg3 ] ] ) . nevertheless , the formalism as a whole is still valid in this case , because one can instead employ equation ( [ bl2eff_avg ] ) , @xmath393 , although it is more computationally expensive .",
    "second , if the total numbers of the pixels ( @xmath202 ) and of the temporal samples ( @xmath27 ) are not large , then some statistical averages taken in the formalism may not be appropriate ( e.g. , eqs .",

    "this will cause the violation of some main results like equations ( [ bl2eff_avg4 ] ) , ( [ bl2_effx ] ) , and ( [ bl2_effxapp2 ] ) .",
    "however , since the @xmath202 and @xmath27 are not large in this case , one can always employ the full treatment of asymmetric beams as described by equation ( [ clbb ] ) .",
    "the main results of our formalism are needed only when @xmath202 and @xmath27 are large enough to cause computational difficulty in implementing equation ( [ clbb ] ) .",
    "we note that even in the full treatment of asymmetric beams , our results in dealing with the extra convolution effects due to the pixelization of the map ( see sec .  [ deconvolution_of_the_pixel_smoothing ] )",
    "can still be employed .",
    "third , the main results of our formalism have assumed that the experimental noise in the temporal samples is independent from each other ( i.e. , the white - noise assumption ; see eq .",

    "as we have also numerically verified , our formalism does not induce any bias in the final @xmath0 estimates in the presence of the nonwhite noise in the maxima-1 data .",
    "even if the experimental noise is extremely nonwhite , we can still deal with asymmetric beams by employing the general results in our formalism .",

    "this formalism is very flexible and therefore well suited to a wide spectrum of circumstances , especially when the experimental beams are not symmetric .",
    "no matter how irregular the beams are , the formalism always provides a both computationally economical and statistically plausible way to estimate the angular power spectrum of the cmb .",

    "we shall show that even in this case , for the purposes of determining @xmath18 and thus the pixel - pixel beam expansion , the white - noise approximation ( [ white - noise ] ) is still appropriate under certain conditions , which are generally satisfied by practical situations .",

    "thus we see that with a given pixelization scheme ( and thus given @xmath13 ) , the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath273 depends only on the property of @xmath397 .",
    "in most experiments , the temporal fourier transform @xmath398 of @xmath397 in the frequency @xmath399 domain usually has the following structure : a ` @xmath366 ' behavior below @xmath400 due to the receiver response , a power law above @xmath401 due to the electronic filtering , and a white noise of amplitude @xmath402 ( c.f .",
    "[ [ white - noise ] ] ) between @xmath400 and @xmath401 .",
    "since the temporal fourier transform @xmath403 of @xmath404 is simply the inverse of @xmath398 , we can approximate a usual @xmath403 as @xmath405,\\ ] ] where @xmath402 is the amplitude of the white noise part in @xmath398 , and @xmath406 ( @xmath407 ) is a top - hat window function : @xmath408 thus in the real space we have @xmath409 where @xmath410 here we have used the usual definition @xmath411 . therefore , to test if the white - noise approximation ( see eqs .  [ [ white - noise ] ] and [ [ bplmpi ] ] ) is appropriate , we can substitute @xmath412 and @xmath413 separately as the @xmath414 into equation ( [ bplmy0x ] ) , and see if the resulting equation is consistent with the result ( [ bplmpi ] ) .",
    "we may thus derive the conditions under which the result ( [ bplmpi ] ) is a good approximation even if the noise is not white .",
    "we first consider the first term @xmath412 in equation ( [ n-1 ] ) , i.e.  the effect from the high - frequency cut at @xmath401 .",
    "in the white - noise case , the first term becomes @xmath415 , which is a dirac delta along the @xmath7 and @xmath416 directions with a peak centered at @xmath417 .",
    "the fact that the width of this peak is zero means that the correlation time of the temporal scan is zero , so that each sample is independent and a pixel is related to only the temporal hits inside the pixel , giving the form ( [ bplmpi ] ) . on the other hand , in cases where @xmath401 is finite , the width of this central peak ( the distance between the first zeros of @xmath418 from @xmath417 along the @xmath7 or @xmath416 direction ) is broadened ( when compared to the white - noise case ) from zero to @xmath419 ( see eq .  [ [ n-1n ] ] ) .",
    "this means that when the noise is white but with a cut - off beyond @xmath401 , the correlation time of the temporal samples will be increased from zero to the order of @xmath419 .",
    "therefore , as long as the correlation time @xmath419 is well below the time required to scan across a pixel , the pixel will have no significant correlation with the temporal hits that are outside the pixel .",

    "although @xmath422 is not a constant in general , its order in a single experiment normally remains the same .",
    "following a similar line of logic , we now consider the second term @xmath413 in equation ( [ n-1 ] ) , i.e.  the effect from the low - frequency cut at @xmath400 . in the white - noise case ,",
    "the second term becomes @xmath424 , which is a constant along both the @xmath7 and @xmath416 directions .",
    "this allows us to simplify equation ( [ bplmy0x ] ) as @xmath425 where @xmath426 is the number of temporal samples in the pixel @xmath8 .",
    "thus we see that equation ( [ bplmpi ] ) automatically fulfills the above requirement .",

    "a naive choice will be @xmath435 but in fact one would usually like to choose a pixel size closer to the smallest limit to fully take advantage of the experimental data . in conclusion , one should choose a pixelization scheme whose pixel sizes satisfy condition ( [ white - noise - cond ] ) ( or have an order given by eq .",
