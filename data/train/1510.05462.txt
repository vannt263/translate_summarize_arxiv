    "in 1933 perrin qualitatively described @xcite and fermi computed @xcite how a nonzero neutrino mass would affect the endpoint of the electron spectrum in a @xmath1-decay process .",
    "decades later , the laboratory quest for a non - zero result in this kind of measurement continues in ernest @xcite .",
    "weak electron capture ( ec ) has a sensitivity to the neutrino mass entirely analogous to the one of @xmath1-decay .",
    "ec is the @xmath2 weak - interaction process whereby an atomic electron interacts with a nucleus of charge @xmath3 to produce a neutrino , leaving behind a nucleus of charge @xmath4 and a hole in the orbital of the daughter atom from which the electron was captured .",
    "the optimal nuclide for ec experiments is @xmath0ho and the most promising technique is `` calorimetry '' @xcite , the measurement of all the energy released in a decay , but that of the escaping neutrino .",
    "the detailed theory of calorimetric energy spectra was developed in @xcite .",
    "the experiments echo @xcite , holmes @xcite and numecs @xcite are starting to measure the calorimetric - energy spectrum resulting from the ec decay @xmath5+\\nu_e , \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\rm dy[h]\\to   dy } + e_c ,   \\label{decays}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dy[h ] is the daughter atom , with h labelling the various possible `` holes '' left by electrons captured from different levels of the ho atom .",
    "dy is the atom s ground state and @xmath6 is the energy released in the de - excitation of dy[h ] to dy .",
    "the @xmath7-value for this ec decay is the record - low of the periodic table and has recently been measured @xcite to be @xmath8 ev .    in the theoretical predictions of @xcite",
    "the calorimetric spectrum was approximated as a sum of single - hole contributions .",
    "robertson has pointed out that two - hole contributions should not be negligible @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a ec event , the wave functions of the spectator electrons in the mother and daugther atoms are slighly mismatched , leading to a spillover effect : secondary holes .",
    "faessler and his collaborators have published state - of - the art results on the probabilities of making two ( or even three ) holes in the ec decay of @xmath0ho @xcite .",
    "their calculations are relativistic and fully anti - symmetrized over the ensemble of all atomic electrons .",
    "they also employ the wave functions of the correct daughter atom , with its primary hole .",
    "an electron having vacated an orbital in which it leaves a second hole may have been _ shaken - up _ to an unoccupied bound - state level of the daughter atom ; or _ shaken - off _ into the unbound `` continuum '' .    in plotting",
    "predicted spectra for @xmath0ho - decay calorimetry , previous authors @xcite have tacitly assumed that the computed probabilities for making a second hole characterize the odds of electron shake - up ( corresponding to a narrow resonance in the spectrum ) and _ not _ the ones of electron shake - off ( corresponding to a much broader feature ) .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the preliminary data indicates that this tacit assumption is entirely wrong .",
    "in the dominant branches of ho ec decay , eq.([decays ] ) , a single hole h is left in the orbitals h = m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 , o1 , o2 or p1 , above which @xmath9 runs out of electrons . to the extent that the decay line - width of @xmath10 $ ] is small",
    ", this two - body decay process is `` monochromatic '' , with a fixed neutrino energy for each given h , @xmath11=q - e[\\rm h]$ ] , where @xmath12 $ ] is the binding energy of the missing electron in dy , in the convention in which it is positive .    in an ideal calorimetric experiment ,",
    "only the neutrino escapes the source - implanted detector , and the entire energy @xmath12 $ ] delivered as the electronic hole is filled is measured @xcite . in the case at hand",
    "the fluorescence yields ( relative x - ray emissions ) are small , the unstable dy atom preferentially stabilizes by successive coster - kronig ( and subdominant auger ) electron ejections .",
    "the spectrum of calorimetric energies , @xmath6 , is a sum of breit - wigner peaks at the @xmath13 positions with their natural hole widths , @xmath14 .",
    "the peak intensities are proportional to @xmath15 , the values in ho of the squared wave functions at the origin of the electrons to be captured .",
    "the individual contribution of a given hole to the ec decay rate @xmath16 at a given @xmath6 is : @xmath17\\over de_c}= \\kappa\\ ; e_\\nu\\,p_\\nu\\,n_{\\rm h}\\ , \\varphi_{\\rm h}^2(0)\\ , bw[e_c , e_{\\rm h},\\gamma_{\\rm h } ] , \\label{drdec}\\\\ & & bw[e_c , e_{\\rm h},\\gamma_{\\rm h}]\\equiv { \\gamma_{\\rm h}\\over 2\\pi}\\,{1\\over ( e_c - e_{\\rm h})^2+\\gamma_{\\rm h}^2/4}\\ , , \\label{bw}\\\\ & & e_\\nu = ( q - e_c ) , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; p_\\nu = \\sqrt{(q - e_c)^2-m_\\nu^2}\\ , , \\label{eandp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath18 in eq.([drdec ] ) originates from the ( squared ) weak - interaction matrix element and the factor @xmath19 in the decay s phase space .",
    "having made explicit the @xmath18 factor , @xmath20 in the excellent approximation in which nuclear recoil is neglected is a constant : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the nuclear matrix element , @xmath23 @xcite an @xmath24 correction for atomic exchange and overlap and @xmath25 the electron occupancy in the h shell of ho ( the actual fraction of the maximum number of electrons with the quantum numbers of h ) .    we know from the observations of neutrino oscillations that the electron neutrino is , to a good approximation , a superposition of three mass eigenstates , @xmath26 : @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we ought to have written @xmath29/de_c$ ] in eqs.([drdec]-[eq : resonances ] ) as an incoherent superposition of spectra with weights @xmath30 and masses @xmath31 .",
    "but the measured differences @xmath32 are so small that current direct attempts to measure @xmath33 are certain to reach the required accuracy only if neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass , in which case @xmath34 in eqs.([drdec]-[eq : resonances ] ) stands for their nearly common mass .",
    "as robertson pointed out @xcite , in an ec event leading to a primary hole h there is a small probability , @xmath35 , for a second hole h to be made in a shake - up process . when the second electron is shaken - up to any unoccupied daughter - atom bound - state level of binding energy negligible relative to @xmath36 the calorimetric energy peaks very close to ( but not precisely ) @xmath37 .",
    "if this energy is not very close to that of a single - hole peak , there is an observable feature in the spectrum , even if @xmath38 .    to the extent that the presence of one hole does not significantly affect the filling i.e .",
    "decay of the other , the natural width of a two - hole state is the sum of the partial widths : @xmath39 . in analogy to the one - hole result of eqs.([drdec]-[eq : resonances ] ) , the contribution of a particular two - hole state to the calorimetric spectrum is : @xmath40\\over de_c}&=&\\kappa\\ ; e_\\nu\\,p_\\nu\\,n_{\\rm h}\\,n_{\\rm h'}\\ , \\{1-\\pi({\\rm h , h')}\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\varphi_{\\rm h}^2(0)\\,p\\rm ( h , h')\\ , bw[e_c , e_{\\rm tot},\\gamma_{\\rm tot } ] , \\label{twoholesup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the occupancy in the h shell and @xmath42 is the operator interchanging the two implicated electrons . more precisely , @xmath43 stands for the operation of symmetrizing the electron pair s orbital wave functions in the singlet antisymmetric spin state , antisymmetrizing the wave functions in the triplet symmetric spin state and adding the results with weights 1/4 and 3/4 .",
    "the creation of a second hole h in the capture leaving a hole h can also occur as the shake - off of the electron in the orbital h to the `` continuum '' of unbound electrons : @xmath44}+e^-+\\nu_e .",

    "some recent results of calorimetric spectra in the decay of @xmath0ho have been made available .",
    "we shall specifically refer to the data in the two plots of fig.([fig : n1 ] ) and the plot of fig.([fig : kunde ] ) .",
    "the first data set is the one presented in @xcite based on results by members of the echo collaboration @xcite .",

    "we do not mean a best fit of the theory to the data , it may be too early for that .",
    "relative to the theoretical expectations , we shall make small modifications of the energies , widths and wave functions at the origin of the one - hole contributions , so that the theoretical curves best describe by eye the data for these dominant contributions ( n2 , n1 , m2 and m1 ) .",
    "similarly , we modify the probabilities of the two - hole contributions most relevant to this discussion ( n1o1 and n1n4/5 ) to provide the best description of the data . for the single - hole contributions the only large deviations from the theoretical values in the literature @xcite are our choices of widths @xmath57 ev and @xmath58 ev , this last value being very close to the recent observation by the echo collaboration @xcite .",
    "our fig.([fig : n1]a ) is somewhat similar to fig.(2 ) of @xcite or fig.(4 ) of @xcite . in fig.([fig : n1]a ) the empirically chosen o1 normalization successfully describes the data .",
    "the chosen n1n4/5 peak s normalization or any other choice does not succeed .",
    "thus we fail to describe the data in the interval @xmath59 with the inclusion of the only two - hole contribution expected to be large in this domain : n1 plus n4/5 shake - up @xcite .    in fig.([fig :",
    "n1]b ) we have neglected the ( unseen ) contribution of n1 capture accompanied by n4/5 shakeup .",
    "more importantly , we consider n1 capture with a second o1 hole in its two possible outcomes : that the o1 electron is shaken - up to a higher bound state , or shaken - off into the continuum . once again , their respective normalizations will be fit by eye to the data .",
    "the shape of the o1 shake - up contribution in both panels of fig.([fig : n1 ] ) is simply a breit - wigner with a peak at @xmath60 ev , with a natural width @xmath61 ev , to which we have added in quadrature , as for all other contributions , an experimental resolution - width @xmath62 ev . the shape of the o1 shake - off contribution requires a longer explanation .",
    "electron capture in ho results in a dy atom which we shall in what follows denote as dy* with a hole in the orbital from which the capture took place .",
    "the absent - electron charge partially shields the one of the absent - proton .",
    "relative to a process without a similar effect such as the creation of a primary hole by photo - ionization the partial shielding generally leads to a reduced probability for the creation of a second hole .",
    "this is because the wave functions of the potentially vacated second orbitals in the parent and daughter atoms have a closer overlap in the presence of shielding . and",
    "in the sudden approximation traditionally used to make these kind of estimates the square of this overlap is the probability of creating a second hole .",
    "intemann and pollock were the first to show how to properly treat the shake - off of a second electron in ec . in what follows",
    "we apply their method and concentrate on n1 capture accompanied by o1 shakeoff .",
    "the trick is to treat the result of n1 capture ( the absent proton and the absent electron ) as a perturbation of the coulomb potential of the form : @xmath63 to first order in @xmath64 the wave function of the o1 level in dy * is then expressed as a linear combination of ho eigenfunctions : @xmath65\\rangle,\\qquad\\qquad   \\label{wave}\\\\ b_n\\equiv { \\alpha \\over e_{_{\\rm o1}}-e_n}\\int d^3r\\ , \\phi_n^ * ( r)\\phi_{_{\\rm o1}}(r)\\ , b(r),\\qquad\\qquad   \\label{b}\\\\ b_{\\rm off}(p_e)\\equiv{\\alpha \\over e_{_{\\rm o1}}+t_e } \\int d^3r\\,\\phi^ * ( p_e , r)\\phi_{_{\\rm o1}}(r)\\ , b(r)\\;\\quad \\label{bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 in the wave functions @xmath67}\\rangle$ ] stands for the @xmath68 bound levels with @xmath69 and ( positive ) binding energy @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the unbound wave function , defined as in , of an @xmath68 electron with momentum @xmath50 and kinetic energy @xmath72",
    ".    we shall continue to refer to the creation of an \\{n1,o1 } pair of holes with the shake - off of one electron as `` o1 shakeoff '' .",
    "this in spite of the fact that , to take into account fermi statistics , one must it goes without saying also do the calculations encapsulated in eqs.([ip]-[bb ] ) with the exchange o1",
    "@xmath73 n1 , since the two - hole final state , at a given @xmath45 , is the same independently of which electron is captured or ejected .",
    "thus , in the sudden approximation , the square of the ( monopolar ) matrix element for an electron being shaken - off with energy @xmath45 results in : @xmath74 for the distribution function of eq.([overlapfree ] ) .    a crucial point in estimating wave - function overlaps is to choose them with the correct spatial scale .",
    "to provide an estimate of the shape of @xmath75 we shall use non - relativistic coulomb wave functions of ho with effective values of @xmath3 chosen to reproduce the relevant orbits mean radii , as calculated with more precise hartree - fock methods @xcite .",

    "peak the description of the data is very good , excellent if we choose to add a constant background of one per bin ( dashed blue curve ) .",
    "the small observed excess in the lower energy side of the n1 peak must be due to an asymmetry of the resolution function .",
    "it may be more difficult to use this as an excuse for the data excess below 300 ev .    in fig.([fig",
    ": kunde ] ) we compare the theory with the numecs data .",
    "the theoretical parameters ( resonance energies , widths and relative magnitudes ) are identical to the ones in the preceeding description of the echo data . only the overall normalization and the experimental resolution",

    "the description of these preliminary data is once again very satisfactory and requires the presence of the `` shoulder '' due to o1 shake - off .",
    "the absence at the theoretically expected level of a peak corresponding to m1 capture plus n4/5 shakeup is also remarkable .",
    "in fig.([fig : n1]b ) we have used the predicted _ shapes _ and positions of the n1o1 shakeup and shakeoff contributions to provide a description of the data .",

    "the shape and magnitude of the n1o1 shakeoff contribution are similarly governed by eqs.([edistr],[antisym ] ) .",
    "the n1n4/5 shakeup and shakeoff are calculated in an identical fashion , with the substitution of o1 for n4/5 , and recalling that , neglecting nuclear - size effects , @xmath87 .    in fig.([fig :",
    "n1th]a ) we have plotted the above - mentioned results of our rather simplistic non - relativistic two - electron coulomb - like theory , as well as the resulting one - hole plus two - hole spectrum .",
    "these predictions correctly describe the apparent features of the data , but fail here and there by a factor of @xmath88 .    in fig.([fig :",
    "n1th]b ) we ameliorate the data description of fig.([fig : n1th]a ) by multiplying the prediction for the n1o1up ( off ) contribution by a factor 2.5 ( 0.7 ) .",
    "both the up and off n1n4/5 contributions have been corrected by a factor 1/3 , which is the maximum `` tolerated '' by the data , a smaller factor would give a better description , as in fig.([fig : n1]b ) .",
    "even for the single - hole peaks , the theoretical predictions of some of their widths and relative magnitudes appear to be inaccurate by factors of @xmath88 .",
    "this is not a surprise , atoms with as many electrons as ho or dy are difficult to handle theoretically , in particular when dealing with their outer orbitals .",
    "the real surprise is that our naive treatment of the two - hole contributions yields results of comparable precision .    the day the data are abundant enough to provide a competitive result on the neutrino mass",
    ", the entire spectrum will have been measured with gigantic statistics .",
    "its various contributions will have been understood , at least phenomenologically , with the precision required to distinguish a neutrino mass from any other phenomenon affecting the spectral shape at the endpoint .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the preliminary low - statistics data yields three main conclusions :    * the shake - off of the electrons in a two - hole process is as relevant as their shake - up .",
    "* the theoretical predictions of the two - hole probabilities do not agree with the data . *",
    "the potentially most important threat to a simple theoretical analysis of the end - point of the spectrum may be the process of m1 capture accompanied by n1 shake-_off_.    we plan to write a much more detailed paper in which we discuss , along many other relevant points , the reasons why the current two - hole calculations and the observations may disagree , as well as the reasons why the last of the above items ought not to be a problem . +",
