    "hadron polarizabilities are structure parameters , the values of which are very sensitive to predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "therefore , accurate experimental determination of these values provides a method for testing the validity of such models .",
    "however , because there are no pion targets , it is necessary to use indirect methods to determine the pion polarizabilities .",
    "for example , the dipole polarizabilities of charged pions can be determined either from the scattering of the high energy pions off the coulomb field of heavy nuclei @xcite or from radiative @xmath4 photoproduction from the proton @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained from analyses of the reaction @xmath5 at low energies @xcite are essentially model dependent due to the strong @xmath6-wave @xmath7 interaction in this energy region .    moreover , due to the fact that the born term for the reaction @xmath8 is equal to zero , extraction of the @xmath1 meson polarizabilities by extrapolating the experimental data on the radiative @xmath1 photoproduction from the proton to the pion pole is ineffective . at present the most reliable method in this case",
    "is an analysis of the process @xmath0 in the region of the @xmath9 meson where the cross section of this process is very sensitive to the values of the @xmath1 polarizabilities . in the work @xcite the analysis of the angular distributions of pions from the process @xmath0 in this energy region has resulted in @xmath10 ( in units of @xmath11@xmath12 ) .",

    "the @xmath17 meson was considered as an effective description of the strong @xmath6-wave @xmath18 interaction using the broad bright - wigner resonance expression .",
    "the parameters of such a @xmath17 meson were found from the fit to the experimental data @xcite in the energy region 270825 mev . as a result ,",
    "a good description of the experimental data @xcite was obtained for @xmath192701700 mev .",
    "however , this model predicts a strong rise in the total cross section at higher energies in contradiction with the experimental data .    in the present work",
    "we show that this discrepancy can be eliminated in the energy region at least up to 2.25 gev by considering the quadrupole @xmath1 meson polarizabilities as free parameters .",
    "an investigation of the process @xmath0 at low and middle energies was also carried out in the framework of different theoretical models @xcite .",
    "however , these models did not allow a good description of the experimental data @xcite on the total cross section in the full energy region from 270 to 2000 mev .",

    "is studied using dispersion relations at fixed @xmath13 with a subtraction for invariant amplitudes .",
    "the subtraction functions are determined by the drs in cross channels with two subtractions where the subtraction constants are connected with dipole and quadrupole pion polarizabilities .",
    "the subtractions in the drs provide good convergence of the integrand expressions of these drs and so increase the reliability of the calculations .",
    "it is shown that the total cross section of the process @xmath0 is very sensitive to the values of the quadrupole polarizabilities in the energy region higher than 1250 mev .",
    "the fit of the experimental data @xcite to the process @xmath0 using the drs constructed has allowed for the determination of the values of the sum and the difference of the @xmath1 meson quadrupole polarizabilities for the first time .    in order to analyze these values of the quadrupole polarizabilities ,",
