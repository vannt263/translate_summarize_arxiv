    "low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) , operationally defined as a h@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath1 , reside in about 40  per  cent of nearby bright galaxies , and occupy majority of the population of agns @xcite .",
    "its low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rate on to super - massive black holes .",
    "such accretion has often been explained by the model of optically - thin disc such as an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; @xcite ) , rather than optically - thick disc ( ` standard disc ' ; ) .",
    "it is predicted that the adaf has a ` submillimetre bump ' in its spectral - energy distribution ( sed ) , while the standard disc is responsible for a big - blue bump in the sed of luminous agns such as quasars . since a high brightness temperature of @xmath2  k in radio bands",
    "is expected from the adaf model , the first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very - long - baseline - interferometry ( vlbi ) instruments that will provide micro - arcsec resolutions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observational evidence of the adaf is crucial in the llagn radio sources .",
    "although the adaf model successfully explains the broadband spectra of llagns , there is a significant gap between observations and the adaf spectrum especially at low - frequency radio bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that additional unknown emission does exist , and putative emission from the accretion disc may be buried under it .",
    "the submillimetre bump means a highly inverted spectrum at centimetre - to - submillimetre wavelengths of spectral index @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is flux density at frequency @xmath6 @xcite",
    ". observations for llagns have been carried out exclusively at centimetre bands where high sensitivities are available , because most of llagns are very faint radio sources .",
    "about half of low - luminosity seyfert galaxies and low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; @xcite ) hold a compact radio core @xcite , and at least 25 per cent of transition objects , which are hypothesized to be liner/-nucleus composite systems @xcite , also hold a compact core @xcite , at 15 or 8.4  ghz in 0.152.5 arcsec resolutions . most of the cores show nearly flat spectra ( @xmath7 ) in 0.5-arcsec resolution : that is evidence for jet domination @xcite .",
    "although slightly inverted spectra have been found in unresolved compact cores of several llagns in milli - arcsec resolutions of vlbis , their radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratios suggest that another significant radio component seems to contribute in addition to original fluxes from the adaf model @xcite .",
    "to explain this radio excess , an jet  adaf model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "thus , at centimetre bands , the contamination that is believed to be from jets has prevented the adaf from being revealed .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many llagns .",
    "although technically difficult , a high - frequency observation is very promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the adaf because of following two advantages : ( 1 ) spectral measurements at high frequencies are less affected by non - thermal jets , which generally show power - law spectra ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) , and ( 2 ) the adaf predicts larger flux densities at higher frequencies .",
    "in fact , it has been obsevationally confirmed that flux densities at millimetre wavelengths are 510 times larger than those at centimetre wavelengths in sgr  a * ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is the nearest low - accretion rate system from us .",
    "however , contamination from diffuse dust may be harmful at @xmath10  ghz when we use a poor spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , the use of a beam as small as possible and the estimations of every conceivable contamination are essential .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows .",
    "sample selection is described in section  [ section : sample ] .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in section  [ section : obs&reduction ] . in section",
    "[ section : results ] , we report these results and the estimations of diffuse contamination in our millimetre measurements .",
    "our results of submillimetre photometry are utilized only for estimation for dust contribution .",
    "the origins of the spectra are discussed in section  [ section : discussion ] from the relation between the high - frequency radio spectrum and low - frequency radio core power .",
    "finally , we summarize in section  [ section : summary ] .",
    "our sample , ` vlbi - detected llagn sample ' , covers 20 out of 25 all - known llagn radio sources that have been detected with vlbis ( column [ 1 ] of table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the other five llagns are ngc  4235 , ngc  4450 @xcite , ngc  524 , ngc  5354 , and ngc  5846 @xcite , which were recently newly vlbi - detected , but whose reports had not yet been published when we plan the survey .",
    "it is difficult to estimate resultant selection bias including into our sample , because of multiplicity in selection criteria across the past vlbi surveys .",
    "however , at least we can say that 16 out of 20 sources of our sample are all known llagns that are at @xmath11  mpc with @xmath12  mjy at 15  ghz , and the other four sources ( ngc 266 , ngc 3147 , ngc 3226 , and ngc 4772 ) are more distant .",
    "it may be , therefore , as a moderately good distance - limited and radio - flux - limited sample for llagns with a compact radio core .",
    "we made millimetre continuum observations for 16 out of 20 targets using the nobeyama millimetre array ( nma ) , at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) , with d configuration that is the most compact array configuration .",
    "we had precluded the other four sources from our observation list because they had already been observed at @xmath13  mm in the past ( ngc  266 , @xcite ; ngc  3031 , @xcite ; ngc  4258 , doi  et  al . in prep . ; ngc  4486 , @xcite ) .",
    "our campaign spent more than 20 observational days between 2002 november  28 and 2003 may  25 .",
    "most of weak targets were observed over several days for integration .",
    "visibility data were obtained with double - sided - band receiving system at centre frequencies of 89.725 and 101.725 ghz , which were doppler - tracked .",
    "we used the ultra wide - band correlator ( uwbc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can process a bandwidth of 1  ghz per each sideband , i.e. , 2  ghz in total . the wide bandwidth gives the nma a very high sensitivity for continuum observations .",
    "even if the systemic velocities of our targets and galaxies rotations of several hundred km  s@xmath14 are accounted for , the observing band can avoid possible contaminations from several significant line emissions : @xmath15co(@xmath16 ) , c@xmath17o(@xmath16 ) , hcn(@xmath16 ) , hco@xmath18(@xmath16 ) , and sio(@xmath19 ) .",
    "a system noise temperature , @xmath20 , was typically about 150  k in the double - sided bands . for observations of each target , we made scans of a reference calibrator close to the target every 20 or 25  minutes for gain calibration .",
    "bandpass calibrators of very bright quasars were scanned once a day .",
    "the data were reduced using the uvproc - ii package @xcite , developed at the nro , by standard manners , including flagging bad data , baseline correction , opacity correction , bandpass calibration and gain calibration . to achieve higher sensitivity , visibilities of both",
    "the sidebands were combined in the same weight , which resulted in a centre frequency of 95.725 ghz .",
    "each daily image was individually made in natural weighting and deconvolved using the aips software , developed at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "statistically significant variability was detected from the daily images in several llagns , which will be reported in a separate paper . in the present paper ,",
    "the visibilities of all days were combined by weighting with @xmath21 , and then imaged .",
    "the half - power beam widths ( hpbws ) of synthesized beams were typically @xmath22  arcsec , corresponding to @xmath23660  pc at a mean distance of 18.9  mpc in our sample .",
    "the flux scales of the gain calibrators were derived with the uncertainty to 10  per  cent by relative comparisons to the flux - known calibrators , such as uranus , neptune , or mars .",
    "these were scanned quasi - simultaneously when they were at almost the same elevations .",
    "the rms of noise on the images were estimated from statistics on off - source blank sky with the imean task of the aips .",
    "source identifications and measurements of flux densities were done on image domain by elliptical gaussian profile fitting with the jmfit task of the aips .",
    "we derived total errors in the flux measurements from root sum square of the errors in the gaussian fitting ( including thermal noise ) and the flux scaling .",
    "we attempted to measure flux densities at submillimetre band from the nuclear regions using archival data .",
    "we searched the data that had been obtained at 347.38 ghz ( @xmath24 ) using submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "the data of 14 out of 20 objects of the vlbi - detected sample were available to the public on 2004 .",
    "the jcmt measurements for five objects have already been reported ( ngc 266 , @xcite ; ngc 4258 , doi et  al . in  prep .",

    "four objects had been observed in jiggle - map mode .",
    "we reduced these data using the scuba user reduction facility ( surf ) package .",
    "standard reduction procedures were used , including flat fielding , flagging of transient spikes , correction for extinction , pointing correction , sky removal and flux - density scaling .",
    "flux calibrators ( uranus , mars , or crl  618 ) gave us flux scaling factors ( we assumed its uncertainty to @xmath2315  per  cent ) and an effective beam size of 15.1  arcsec .",
    "the derivations of the rms of noise on images , source identifications , measurements of flux densities , and total error estimations were done in the same manners as the nma reductions described in section  [ subsection:3 mm ] .",
    "the other five objects had been observed in photometry mode .",
    "we followed standard reduction procedures , including flat fielding , flagging of transient spikes , correction for extinction , sky removal , averaging , and flux - density scaling , using the surf package .",

    "we have suggested in the previous section that jets and the adaf seem to coexist in llagns .",
    "however , only an unresolved structure has been found in milli - arcsec images for most of the vlbi - detected llagns @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "pc / sub - pc - scale jet structures have been found in several llagns .",
    "we find from the core power ranking in table  [ table4 ] that the presence of vlbi - detectable pc - scale jets depends on the core radio powers .",
    "the pc - scale jets have been found exclusively in high - core - power sources . in low - core - power sources ,",
    "no pc - scale jet has been detected in vlbi images even with moderately high dynamic ranges of @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "sub - pc - scale jets have been revealed in their nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nevertheless , they are low - core - power llagns .",
    "note that the two llagns are the nearest two sources in the vlbi - detected sample ( table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "we speculate that all low - core - power sources also have sub - pc - scale or smaller jets , and that such structures would be revealed if they were at less than several  mpc like ngc  3031 and ngc  4258 .",
    "the detectability of small - scale jets might merely depend on distance .",
    "if that is true , the 5-ghz vlbi - core power should contain jet contributions significantly .",
    "additionally , ngc  3031 and ngc  4258 are very suggestive cases also about coexistence with the adaf disc .",
    "although they show clear evidence of jets , their high - frequency spectra are highly inverted , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these are the highest two spectral indices in the vlbi - detected llagns with negligible diffuse contaminations .",
    "if their millimetre emissions originate in the adaf discs , the two llagns would be examples for the coexistence of the jets and adaf .",
    "we mention apparent exceptions .",
    "ngc  266 and ngc  3147 show steep spectra , but have no detectable jet in spite of their high core powers  ( table  [ table4 ] ) . since the two llagns are the most two distant llagns in our sample , it could be somewhat hard to reveal their putative small - scale jet structures .",
    "their high radio powers might be also responsible for the dominance of such small - scale jets .",
    "ngc  5866 show a definitely steep spectrum , in spite of a low core power .",
    "its nuclear activity type , ` transition ' , might be related to the jet domination ; another transition object , ngc  4552 , also shows a definitely steep spectrum .",
    "however , our limited sample of transition objects can not allow us to discuss it in detail",
    ".      there appears a clear difference in the spectral properties between type  1s ( s1.5 , s1.9 , and l1.9 ) and type  2s ( s2 , l2 , and t2 ) , as seen in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "most of the type  1s show inverted spectra , while most of type  2s show steep spectra .",
    "we suggest this difference conflicts with the unified scheme @xcite . in this scheme , many observed properties are determined basically only by a viewing angle with respect to the obscuring dusty torus surrounding the nucleus .",
    "type-1 seyferts , with broad permitted optical emission lines , are those in which the torus is viewed closer to face - on orientation .",
    "type-2 seyferts lack broad permitted lines , except in polarized flux , and thought to be seen with the line of sight passing through the torus in an orientation closer to edge - on .",
    "this classification has been expediently used in liners and transitions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the radio emission is transparent through the dusty torus , luminosities and spectral indices of type  1s and 2s should look just the same to the observer unless affected by relativistic beaming .",
    "however , radio powers of type  2s tend to be significantly larger than those of type 1s in our sample .",
    "it seems that the difference is due to larger contribution of jets in type  2s , nevertheless , which would be less affected by relativistic beaming than type  1s .",
    "there are also the other reports about differences between type  1s and type  2s in llagns .",
    "@xcite found that low - luminosity type-1 seyferts rather show somewhat stronger centimetre radio emission than low - luminosity type-2 seyferts .",
    "@xcite have reported that type-2 llagns are underluminous in an x - ray band compared to type-1 ones with the same h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "there are ` intrinsically true type-2 seyferts ( without broad lines even in polarized flux ) ' especially in the low - luminosity range ( @xcite , and reference therein ) .",
    "thus , the discrepancy in the unified scheme is commonly seen in llagns .",
    "we suggest a possible idea for the discrepancy with the unified scheme in terms of radio properties of llagns .",
    "if outflows carry accreting mass away and decrease a density at the innermost disc , then the spectral - peak frequency could decrease to several tens of ghz @xcite .",
    "although such a central engine could generate strong jets , neither high - frequency inverted spectra nor a lot of up - scattered photons that will ionize broad - line clouds can be produced .",
    "that is , llagns with strong jets would tend to have weak broad - line emission , which could not have been detected in a limited sensitivity of the optical survey , then they could be classified into type 2s , even if the obscuring torus is in a face - on orientation .",
    "we have found evidence for inverted high - frequency radio spectra in a number of llagns .",
    "such a high - frequency property is potentially the long - sought signatures of the adaf .",
    "it is an apparent observational confirmation for the submillimetre bump theoretically - predicted in the adaf model . in past observations ,",
    "the radio spectra of llagns had been investigated exclusively at centimetre bands where high sensitivities are available .",
    "@xcite reported the radio spectra of 16 llagns that had been observed with the vla at 515  ghz ; @xcite reported the radio spectra of three llagns that had been observed with the vlba at 1.78.4  ghz ; @xcite reported the radio spectra measured with the vlba for three llagns at 2.315  ghz and three llagns at 1.743  ghz .",
    "the frequency range of submillimetre - bump hunting has greatly expanded by our high - frequency radio survey .",
    "our findings will encourage further llagn surveys at higher - frequency ranges with , e.g. , the coming atacama large millimetre and submillimetre array ( alma ) , to prove the adaf .",
    "the existence of the adaf will give radio astronomers a chance to make the direct imaging for accretion discs .",
    "their area of study had been limited to the nonthermal phenomena in relativistic jets of agns , although optical and x - ray astronomers have observed the direct fluxes from the accretion discs as unresolved sources .",
    "radio astronomers have vlbi techniques , which provide the greatest spatial resolutions all over the electromagnetic wavelengths .",
    "a high - frequency vlbi instrument will report the first image of morphology of accretion discs in micro - arcsec resolutions .",
    "the vsop-2 , a next generation space vlbi mission currently being planned , will provide a 38  micro - arcsec resolution at 43  ghz and a brightness - temperature sensitivity of 10@xmath31  k @xcite . because an electron temperature of 10@xmath32  k at the region within several tens schwarzschild radius is predicted by the adaf model",
    ", the vsop-2 can reveal disc structures of more than a dozen nearby llagns .",
    "if the accretion disc were an optically - thick standard disc , it will have never been detected with the vlbi because of low brightness temperature .    from our results , both the jets and disc seem to coexist in the core of llagns , and their flux ratios are different from object to object .",
    "it suggests that relative radiative efficiencies between the jet and disc would determined by some kind of physical parameter(s ) in the central engine . from the theoretical point of view @xcite",
    ", it has been suggested that radiatively inefficient flows of low accretion rate tend to stimulate strong convective instabilities and powerful outflows .",
    "the central engines of llagns probably can produce jets .",
    "we will discuss the physical parameters that control jet productions in our llagn sample in a separate paper ( doi et  al .",
    "in  prep ) .",
    "our millimetre survey and analyses of submillimetre archival data for the 20 vlbi - detected llagns reveal high - frequency radio spectra of llagns with compact cores as follows :    ( i ) : :    at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and    96  ghz .",
    "we used the published data at 15  ghz with the vla in a    0.15-arcsec resolution and our measurements at 96  ghz with the nma in    a 7-arcsec resolution .",
    "( ii ) : :    submillimetre fluxes measured with the scuba on the jcmt may be from    the dust associated with host galaxies .",
    "these data have been useful to    estimate dust contamination in the nma measurements .",
    "( iii ) : :    we confirm little diffuse contamination in the nma measurements from    dust , free ",
    "free , and extended nonthermal emissions for llagns showing    inverted spectra .",
    "therefore , the inverted spectra are not caused by    resolution effect , but intrinsic properties of the cores .",
    "( iv ) : :    in our sample of 20 llagns , radio cores with inverted high frequency    radio spectra reside in at least ten llagns .",
    "( v ) : :    we find an inverse correlation between the high - frequency radio    spectrum and the low - frequency radio core power .",
    "such a property can    be explained by an idea that flux ratios between the jet showing steep    spectrum and the adaf disc showing inverted spectrum are different    from llagn to llagn .",
    "the disc components could be seen only if the    jets are faint .",
    "consequently , we have found evidence for inverted high - frequency radio spectra in a number of llagns .",
