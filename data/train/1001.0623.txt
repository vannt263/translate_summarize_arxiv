    "though it rules out small part of the parameter space for the sm higgs sector , it rules out most of natural parameter space for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .    in the mssm , the quartic coupling of higgs in the potential is determined from measured gauge couplings and the light cp even higgs mass has an upper bound of about 120 gev ( which can be 130 or 135 gev if stop mixing is maximal ) @xcite @xcite . however , this upper bound is achieved only when the stop mass is as heavy as 1 tev which makes it difficult to understand the weak scale out of it .",
    "this ` little hierarchy problem ' in the mssm has been considered seriously for recent several years and many possible extensions of the mssm have been proposed @xcite . even within the framework of mssm",
    ", it was shown that the boundary condition at high energy which provides negative stop mass squared can reduce the fine tuning for the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite and explicit model has been proposed @xcite @xcite .    as an extension of the mssm , nmssm ( next to mssm ) is one of the most popular scenarios @xcite .",
    "gauge sector extensions also have been proposed @xcite @xcite .",
    "recently bmssm ( beyond mssm ) has been proposed as a frame to study possible operators which can affect the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "there are extra fields above tev scale but these new states can be integrated out below tev such that we still keep the spectrum of the mssm below tev down to the weak scale .",
    "these new tev particles modify the conventional higgs potential and can increase the higgs mass in this setup @xcite and also higgs mixing angle can be significantly changed such that higgs phenomenology can be quite different from standard one @xcite .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis with the light stop in bmssm has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the lep bound is applied to the sm higgs and in principle it can be weaker in the mssm , nmssm or bmssm if the production or decay is very different from the sm .",
    "there had been extensive studies on nonstandard decay of higgs which can happen if there is an extra light particle ( e.g. , a singlet of nmssm ) and the decay of higgs is not just @xmath1 @xcite .    in this letter , we extend the work in the framework of bmssm @xcite which alters the higgs phenomenology ( both production and decay ) significantly .",
    "we assume that all new states other than the mssm fields are heavier than tev such that they are captured only through the effective higher dimensional operators after integrating out them . thus the spectrum is the same as the mssm below tev . in this framework",
    "we propose a possibility of light higgs which might have been produced at lep i / ii @xcite @xcite @xcite . if cp odd higgs ( a ) is lighter than upsilon ( bottomonium ) , it can alter higgs decay significantly .",
    "in addition if light cp even higgs ( h ) is lighter than z boson such that @xmath2 is kinematically allowed , @xmath1 produced from @xmath3 decay can affect the electroweak precision data measured at lep . in this case",
    "the suppression of @xmath4 is possible with the aid of bmssm operators .",
    "the contents of the letter is following .",
    "firstly , various higgs search bounds are briefly reviewed to convince that light higgs scenario proposed here is compatible with all the existing bounds .",
    "secondly , we take the sample points of the bmssm which have interesting features and can have interesting implications for the electroweak precision data of lep .",
    "thirdly , we attempt to soften the discrepancy between the sm predictions and the lep precision measurements within the scenario .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude .",
    "for the sm higgs , lep bound on the higgs mass is 114 gev at 95 percent confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "this equally applies to the higgs field which has the same coupling to z boson and decays in the same way as the sm higgs .",
    "therefore , there are two ways to avoid the bound .",
    "if the production is suppressed , the bound becomes weaker .",
    "the modification of decay also makes the bound weaker depending on the channel . for the production ,",
    "higgsstrahlung is suppressed for light cp even higgs if @xmath5 coupling is small . for @xmath6",
    ", the higgs can be as light as 70 to 75 gev from decay mode independent search @xcite .    in this case",
    "the other cp even higgs @xmath7 couples to z boson with almost the same strength as the sm higgs since there is a sum rule , @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath7 , we can modify its decay if cp odd higgs decays mostly to @xmath9 rather than to @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath12 gev ( lighter than @xmath13 ) , @xmath7 can be as light as 100 gev as @xmath14 does not give a strong constraint .",
    "once @xmath15 is very light , we also expect the charged higgs mass to be close to w boson mass in mssm - like theories as the tree level mass relation between charged higgs , cp odd higgs and w boson is following .",
    "m_h^^2 & = & m_w^2 + m_a^2 .",
    "this is violated by loop corrections in the mssm but the violation is very tiny . in bmssm , the modification can be sizable depending on which operators are added , but still the charged higgs will be at around the weak scale .",
    "such a light higgs might be dangerous .",
    "however , it was shown that it can be perfectly consistent with the charged higgs search from the top decay at the tevatron since the charged higgs decays not only to @xmath16 ( and @xmath17 ) but also decays to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath19 production is kinematically allowed at the z pole , it can provide a very interesting signature . for small @xmath5 coupling which is needed to keep @xmath3 lighter than z boson ,",
    "@xmath20 coupling is almost maximal and @xmath21 associated production is possible .",
    "the branching ratio of z to higgs is typically a few percent of z to @xmath1 .",
    "there are two possibilities .",

    "more interesting possibility is the case when @xmath3 mainly decays to @xmath10 .",
    "although it requires a fine tuning in the parameter choice since @xmath3 coupling to @xmath19 is of order one while it couples to @xmath24 with a bottom yukawa coupling which is smaller than one except at large @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath27 would be the main decay channel .",
    "for @xmath28 gev , @xmath3 and @xmath19 are produced with very small kinetic energy and two taus decayed from @xmath19 would be very soft .",
    "two tau jets carry about 15 gev of energy ( 7.5 gev each ) and the measured energy of each tau jet will be typically smaller than 5 gev since it emits at least one tau neutrino and can emit more in leptonic decays . if the energy of tau jet is less than 5 gev , it is too soft to be identified as tau jet and the whole event will be recorded as hadron events .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the scenario in which @xmath29 is kinematically allowed at the z pole and @xmath3 mainly decays to @xmath1 .",
    "this happens for @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 . to take into account the recent babar result on upsilon decay , we take @xmath32 or @xmath33 gev as a representative value",
    "the change of @xmath15 does not affect the result very much other than the light cp odd higgs search bound .",
    "the above mentioned scenario is hard to be realized in the mssm .",
    "the eigenvalue of the light cp even higgs is too small ( less than 50 or 60 gev ) if cp odd higgs mass is below 10 gev in the mssm .",
    "also the light cp even higgs usually couples more strongly to z boson than the heavy one .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to satisfy the direct search bound in the mssm for such a light cp odd higgs .    the scenario can be realized in the bmssm if we include bmssm operators .",
    "if there are new particles at around 1 tev or higher and if they couple to higgs fields with order one coupling , we can generate effective dimension five and dimension six operators which can give corrections comparable to the usual d term quartic couplings of higgs fields .",
    "the bmssm just adds new operators such that they can alter the mass and the couplings of the higgs fields but does not introduce new light states into which higgs can decay .",
    "therefore , higgs decay is modified in the bmssm only through the modification of higgs couplings , e.g. , @xmath34 .",
    "there are many operators with effective dimension five and six in the bmssm . in this letter , we just consider two of them which might be relevant to the discussion . by",

    "forward backward asymmetry or @xmath72 measurement at lep can be affected by bottom quarks produced from higgs .",
    "for @xmath141 to @xmath59 , it is possible to find a parameter space which can ameliorate the tension in @xmath0 without spoiling nice agreement in @xmath72 .",
    "this scenario at the same time predicts very light charged higgs @xmath73 but still it can be consistent with current @xmath125 observation by having a cancelation with light stop - chargino loop . to confirm whether this is the case or not , more careful analysis on discriminating soft taus from gluon jets and angular distribution fit is needed .",
    "independently of its relation to @xmath0 , light cp odd higgs scenario in bmssm or 2hdm is interesting enough and further exploration is left for future work .",

    "<S> in this letter we consider very light higgs fields in bmssm(beyond mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum below tev scale is the same as the mssm but the higgs potential is modified and is well described in terms of effective dimension five and six operators . </S>",
    "<S> a correction from the bmssm operators allows us to consider new parameter space of higgs sector which is not allowed in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> it can be regarded as a constrained version of general 2 higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) as long as higgs sector is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the possibility that cp odd higgs ( a ) mass is about 7 or 8 gev and charged higgs mass is comparable to w mass . at the same time one of the cp even higgs ( h ) is light enough such that h and a production at the z pole is kinematically allowed . the tension between forward backward asymmetry of bottom quark @xmath0 measured at lep and the standard model prediction can be ameliorated if bottom quark pair produced from light cp even higgs is taken into account . </S>"
