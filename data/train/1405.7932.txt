    "transition metal oxides display a rich array of electronic behaviors many of which remain poorly understood .",
    "because the highest occupied bands in these materials have strong @xmath2 and @xmath3 character , strong correlations are thought to play a significant role .",
    "disorder is often present in these materials due to intrinsic and doped impurities as well as inhomogeneity arising from competing orders . understanding the influence of disorder in strongly - correlated systems is a significant challenge with implications for the characterization and control of transition metal oxides .",
    "the single - particle density of states ( dos ) is relevant to a wide range of materials properties and is a convenient point of contact between theory and experiment .",
    "the combination of interactions and disorder is known to cause changes in the dos near the fermi level , and experiments are often compared with the two paradigms of the efros - shklovskii coulomb gap@xcite and the altshuler - aronov zero - bias anomaly.@xcite however , experimental data in strongly - correlated systems is frequently inconsistent with both of these pictures , and a better description of these systems is needed.@xcite    significant progress has been made in understanding the behavior of the dos near the fermi level in systems with strong local interactions and strong site disorder .",

    "more recently there has been numerical work@xcite exploring how the inclusion of _ non_local interactions affects this picture of a kinetic - energy - driven zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) . for weak nearest - neighbor repulsion ,",
    "the kinetic - energy - driven zba persists in a renormalized form .",
    "however , with stronger nonlocal interactions , in the parameter space where a clean extended hubbard model displays charge density wave ( cdw ) order,@xcite the behavior with disorder had a classical character .",
    "while turning to the atomic limit to build understanding has proved useful in the anderson - hubbard model , the presence of nonlocal interactions presents new challenges .",
    "when interactions are purely local , the atomic - limit dos is simple to write down and at zero temperature there is no zba .",
    "in contrast , when nonlocal interactions are present even the clean atomic limit is nontrivial.@xcite    in this work we study the atomic limit of the extended anderson - hubbard model ( eahm ) using classical monte carlo in order to address two groups of questions .",

    "what happens to the coulomb gap when the interactions are short ranged ?",
    "numerical work@xcite has shown that the soft gap fills in when the interaction is exponentially screened , but the elegant analytic argument@xcite giving the energy dependence breaks down when interactions are cut off sharply at a finite distance .",

    "we begin our discussion by reviewing briefly the case with only local interactions . in this case",
    ", the zero temperature dos can be generated by simple arguments .",
    "in particular , the contribution of each site to the dos is independent of the occupancies of any other sites .",
    "when the site potential is greater than the chemical potential @xmath41 , the site will be empty , and it will contribute to the dos at @xmath42 . when @xmath43 , the site will be doubly occupied , and it will contribute to the dos at @xmath44 .",
    "the remaining sites will be singly occupied and will contribute to the dos with half the weight at both energies .    in the clean system at",

    "therefore , the zero temperature dos is two symmetric peaks at @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ uonly ] ( a ) ) .",
    "when disorder is added , there is a continuous distribution of site potentials between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "so long as @xmath49 , each site remains singly occupied , but the contribution to the dos from each site falls at a slightly different frequency .",

    "if it is singly occupied as opposed to empty , it no longer makes its full dos contribution at @xmath54 but instead makes half its contribution at @xmath55 .",
    "this therefore shifts spectral weight from the fermi level to the top of the spectrum , where a small tail also appears .    as the temperature",
    "is increased , this thermal zba broadens and eventually the height of the central plateau declines .",
    "when @xmath56 is the dominant energy scale , each of the four occupancies0 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and 2are equally likely at any site . in this case , the dos is simply the overlap of two flat bands of width @xmath14 centered at @xmath45 and at @xmath46 .",

    "nearest - neighbor interactions favor a checkerboard of e and d sites , as shown in the example configuration to the right of the @xmath33 panel . in a clean system at zero temperature ,",
    "there are just two types of sites : those which are empty and have eight electrons on neighboring sites ( e8 ) , and those which are doubly occupied with no electrons on neighboring sites ( d0 ) .",

    "the red peak on the right is the contribution of empty sites with eight nearest - neighbor electrons ( e8 ) .",
    "when a small amount of disorder is added ( @xmath68 and 1.5 ) , the narrow peaks broaden into bands . in addition , two other changes occur : new peaks appear and the tops of the bands are not flat but slanted .",
    "new peaks appear because of the formation of domains in the checkerboard order .",
    "while nearest - neighbor interactions continue to favor charge ordering , the disorder potential favors the placement of double occupancy at sites of below average potential .",

    "returning to our system , at the boundaries between domains , there are sites with neither zero nor eight nearest - neighbor electrons , resulting in the appearance of new bands in the dos .",
    "the example configuration to the right of the @xmath74 panel shows a vertical domain boundary , on which there are empty sites with only three neighbors doubly occupied ( e6 ) and doubly - occupied sites with only three neighbors empty ( d2 ) .",
    "these sites contribute two new bands to the dos .",
    "diagonal boundaries have a higher energy cost than vertical or horizontal boundaries and occur more frequently at higher disorder .",
    "( see the @xmath75 and @xmath76 example configurations . ) here there are e4 and d4 sites , resulting in another pair of new bands around @xmath52 .",
    "in addition to the broadening of bands and the appearance of new bands , disorder causes variation in height within each band .    at low levels of disorder",
    "the bands slant almost linearly downward toward the fermi level . to understand this , consider the lowest band in the @xmath75 panel .",
    "the low frequency side comes from the contribution of d sites at particularly low potential sites , whereas the high frequency side comes from the contribution of d sites at particularly high potential .",
    "the energetic preference for placing double occupancy at sites with below average potential is being accommodated by the formation of domains .",
    "therefore , double occupancy occurs more often at low potential sites than high potential sites , creating this slant in the dos .",
    "likewise , high potential sites are more likely to be empty and hence the bands at positive frequencies are higher at the high frequency side . as the disorder",
    "is further increased , the slanted bands overlap , resulting in a continuous dos which has a minimum at zero frequency .    at the two largest values of disorder shown ,",
    "the bands are flat at the outside edge , retaining a downward slope only on the side closer to zero frequency . at high disorder strength",

    ". how can we tell whether these patches are occurring any more frequently than they would in a random arrangement ?    a useful quantity to consider is the probability that an empty site will have a number @xmath29 of nearest - neighbor electrons , @xmath62 . for a clean system at zero temperature ,",
    "this distribution is maximally asymmetric : @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( see @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ dfig ] . ) on the other hand , at infinite temperature , where the occupancy of each site is entirely random , this distribution becomes symmetric about @xmath80 : at infinite temperature , the probabilities are simply dictated by the number of ways of arranging the @xmath29 neighboring electrons .",

    "the narrowing of @xmath95 due to @xmath6 is resolved , resulting in a zba in the @xmath97-site contribution .",
    "this causes the zba to become deeper again",
    ". finally , at the largest values of @xmath5 , single occupancy dominates and a mott gap forms .",
    "similarities between the atomic limit results presented here and the dos of the eahm when hopping is included@xcite can provide insight into the more computationally intensive quantum problem for some parameter ranges . in particular , fig .  1 of ref .",
    "[ ] shows the evolution of the dos with increasing nearest - neighbor interaction analogous to fig .",
    "[ vfig ] here .",
    "the narrow @xmath4-dependent zba seen in ref .",
    "[ ] at low @xmath6 values is clearly different physics from what is seen here .",
    "however , in both the quantum and the classical results a broad anomaly seen when @xmath106 ( @xmath107 in fig . 1 of ref .  [ ] and @xmath108 in fig .  [ vfig ] of this paper ) .",
    "moreover , at @xmath109 the results with hopping show two broad slanted bands entirely consistent with the @xmath110 and @xmath111 bands in the atomic limit .",
    "why in the quantum case are only two bands seen , separated by a hard gap , while in our mc work the dos contains multiple bands and remains continuous ?",
    "the quantum calculations used a very small sample size such that the domain size probably remained larger than the sample for all disorder configurations .",
    "this insight helps resolve a point of confusion in ref .",
    "[ ] . in fig .  5 , of that work it was unclear whether the narrow zba which appeared at @xmath112 was the emergence of the kinetic - energy - driven zba for parameter values in which the clean system has cdw order or whether it was different physics . comparing with our fig .",
    "[ ufig ] it seems very likely that the narrow zbas seen in ref .  [ ] fig .",
    "5 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 are a result of atomic - limit physics and distinct from the ke driven zba .",
    "a quantum - classical crossover has also recently been noted in a hartree - fock study without local interactions.@xcite",
    "with the broad goal of developing a theoretical framework for understanding zero - bias anomalies in disordered strongly - correlated systems , we have studied the relatively simple classical problem of the atomic limit of the extended anderson - hubbard model . our results shed light on two distinct issues .",
    "first , regarding zbas in atomic limit systems , we have characterized the equivalent of the efros - shklovskii couloumb gap in a tight - binding model with nearest - neighbor interactions . at low disorder strengths ,",
    "the dos suppression can be sharp with a width that is not set by @xmath6 but rather by details of the overlap of bands coming from groups of sites with the same number of nearest - neighbor electrons . at large disorder strengths",
    ", there is a smooth , shallow region of dos suppression with an energy width proportional to the nearest - neighbor interaction strength @xmath6 .",
    "the origin of this zba is residual charge ordering , namely the increased probability for empty sites to have more than the average number of nearest neighbors and for doubly occupied site to have fewer .",
    "while adding onsite interactions might be expected to suppress this zba by introducing single occupancy , there is an interesting re - entrant behavior in which , after a weakening of the zba at low values of @xmath5 , the zba deepens again at higher @xmath5 values .",
    "second , the dos in this classical system bears a strong resemblance to results obtained from much more computationally intensive exact diagonalization studies of the full eahm ( i.e. with hopping ) for @xmath1 .",
    "the implication is that in this parameter range the interplay of interactions and disorder dominate the behavior while hopping has a negligible effect .",
    "we may conclude that the physical origin of the broad zba seen in the exact diagonalization studies in this regime is primarily the residual charge - ordering effect seen in our monte carlo studies .",
    "in addition , our work provides a starting point for further exploration of the quantum case treating hopping as a small parameter . along the lines of the ensemble of two - site systems used earlier to study the ahm,@xcite an ensemble of small clusters",
    "could be constructed in which the frequency of specific occupancy patterns is set by those found in monte carlo studies of larger lattices .",
    "while many subtleties arise when mapping tight - binding models onto real systems , this work is another step towards an alternative framework for interpreting tunneling and photoemission spectra on insulating strongly - correlated materials , providing , for example , new diagnostics for determining the strengths of correlations in new materials .",
    "we acknowledge support by the national science and engineering research council ( nserc ) of canada . this work was made possible by the facilities of the shared hierarchical academic research computing network ( sharcnet ) .",
