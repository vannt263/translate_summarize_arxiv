    "spectra for 16 thick disk stars and 35 thin disk stars ( based on kinematical selection criteria , see bensby et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) were obtained during six nights in september 2004 with the ces spectrograph on the eso-3.6 m telescope on la silla .",
    "the spectra have a very high resolution of @xmath0 and high signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath1 .",
    "carbon abundances were determined by comparing synthetic spectra ( based on 1-d , plane parallel , lte stellar atmosphere models that were calculated with the uppsala marcs code , gustafsson 1975 ; edvardsson 1993 ) to the observed spectra . the method used for the analysis is the same as that used for the forbidden oxygen line at 6300 ( bensby et al .",
    "stellar parameters were taken from bensby et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) . when synthesising the [ ci ] line a blending fei line was taken into account ( e.g. , lambert & swings 1967 ) .",
    "our analysis of the solar spectrum gives a carbon abundance in the sun of @xmath2 , in good agreement with allende prieto et al .",

    "our first results regarding carbon abundances in the galactic thin and thick disks are ( fig .",
    "1 ) : * ( 1 ) * while the [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] trends separate well for the thin and thick disk samples , they are merged for [ c / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] and are mainly flat ; * ( 2 ) * the two kinematic samples separate well ( as expected ) in the [ c / o ] vs [ o / h ] plot ; * ( 3 ) * the thin disk sample in the same plot have a nearly constant [ c / o ] ratio ; * ( 4 ) * the thick disk sample first shows a flat trend of [ c / o ] vs [ o / h ] for @xmath3 < 0 $ ] where c is depleted relative to o such that @xmath4= -0.3 $ ] to @xmath5dex but at @xmath3=0 $ ] the trend rises ( sharply ) to solar values .",
    "a preliminary interpretation of these results is as follows : * ( i ) * in the thin disk the sources for o ( snii ) and c ( debated ) are tuned such that a flat trend is created ; * ( ii ) * in the thick disk the processes are finely tuned up and until @xmath3=0 $ ] . at @xmath3 = 0 $ ] a new source of c",
    "gets active ( or a source of o drops out ) ; * ( iii ) * studying the [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] trend we find that at @xmath6\\simeq-0.45 $ ] snia sets in ( hence the appearance of the `` knee '' in the abundance plot ) . for [ c / fe ] this does not happen .",
    "this means that the time - scale for the population that contributes c operates on the same time - scale as snia ; * ( iv ) * these results could be exploited to derive an independent measure of the snia lifetimes ( given an understanding of the sources of c ) .",
