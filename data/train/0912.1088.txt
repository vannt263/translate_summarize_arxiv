    "atom interferometry is a valuable tool for studying scientific and technical fields such as precision measurements and quantum information , and a very bright source is bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of atomic gases . in which an important technique is to manipulate the translational motion of atoms and transfer atoms coherently between two localities in position and momentum  @xcite . to obtain the momentum transfer , one useful method is two - photon bragg diffraction , where two laser beams impinge upon atoms , whose atoms can undergo stimulated light - scattering events by absorbing a photon from one of the beams and emitting into the other .",
    "the momentum transfer is determined by the difference in the wave vectors of the beams , and the frequency difference defines the corresponding energy transfer  @xcite .",
    "we will introduce another method to obtain a large number of high - order momentum modes by the resonant superradiant scattering from a bec for a weak pump beam with several frequency components .    a typical superradiance experiment",
    "consists in a far off - resonant laser pulse traveling along the short axis of a cigar - shaped bec sample  @xcite , the scattered lights , called end - fire modes , propagate along the long axis of the condensate , and the recoiled atoms are refereed to as side modes .",
    "a series of experiments  @xcite have sparked related interests in phase - coherent amplification of matter waves  @xcite , quantum information  @xcite , collective scattering instability  @xcite , and coherent imaging  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical descriptions of these cooperative scattering in bec with single - frequency pump have also been presented  @xcite .    for the long and weak pump beam",
    ", we can observe the forward peaks correspond to bragg diffraction of atoms  @xcite , where the high order scattering is limited by detuning barriers for the end - fire mode radiation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a x - shaped recoiling pattern is demonstrated in a short and strong pulse as kapitza - dirac diffraction of atoms  @xcite , where an atom in the condensate absorbs a photon from the pump laser , then emits a photon into an end - fire mode , and recoils forwardly .",
    "meanwhile another atom absorbs a photon from the end - fire modes , emits into the pump beam and finally recoils backwardly . in this case",
    ", there is an energy mismatch of four times the one - photon recoil kinetic energy @xmath0 in backward scattering , which then remains very weak unless a short pumping pulse with a broad spectrum is used .",
    "hence , two phase - locked incident lasers with the frequency difference @xmath1 compensating for the energy mismatch has been used  @xcite , which is named resonant superradiance , where a large number of backward recoiling atoms can be produced .    followed that , it is attractive to extent this idea to achieve a high momentum transfer by overcoming the detuning barriers , by a weak and long pump beams with the resonant frequency .",
    "it requires to analysis the competition between the different transition channels and the spatial distribution of different modes . because the above traditional superradiant - scattering configuration involves many atomic side modes coupled together , to simplify it",
    ", we chose another configuration where a pump beam travels along the long axis of the bec .",
    "this scheme is widely studied in photon echo  @xcite , decoherence  @xcite , spatial distribution effects  @xcite and self - organized formation of dynamic gratings  @xcite .",
    "since the pulse length is far longer than the initial spontaneous process  @xcite , we choose the semi - classical theory which can well describe the experimental results  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first introduce the semi - classical theory for the superradiance scattering with a several - frequency pump in the weak coupling .",
    "then the spatial and time evolutions of scattered modes are analyzed for one - frequency pump beam . followed that ,",
    "in the case of two - frequency pump , we find the backward first order scattering mode is suppressed at the resonant condition @xmath2 and the forward second order mode is enhanced , resulting from the combination of mode competition effects and spatial distribution of the modes .",

    "a correlation between the center depletion of the bec and backward mode was reported in ref .",
    "however , in our case , such correlation does not exist because side mode @xmath58 emerges on the edge of the bec . as a consequence of the edge depletion of the bec , backward side mode @xmath61 is not populated significantly , because the end - fire mode mainly distributes in the leading edge where side mode @xmath29 suffers the strongest depletion .",

    "furthermore , to avoid the reflection from the glass tube and formation of bragg scattering in the experiment , the pump beam can actually deviate a few degrees from the long axis , as shown in the experiments  @xcite .",

    "there is also mode competition to form the end - fire modes along the long axis and suppress the emission on the other direction .",
