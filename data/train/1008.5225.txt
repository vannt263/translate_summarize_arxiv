    "one expects that the studies of relativistic heavy - ion collisions may bring us information about the properties of matter in the early universe ( at the time when its age was about 10 microseconds and its temperature was about 200 mev ) . in this paper",
    "we give an explicit example showing how such expectations may be realized in practice .",
    "our main point is that the theoretical analysis of the hadronic observables collected at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider at bnl ) pinned down the form of the equation of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter .",
    "the use of this eos in the friedmann equation allows us to determine the precise time evolution of the thermodynamic parameters in the early universe .    until recently ,",
    "the soft hadronic observables measured at rhic have been described with the help of the hydrodynamic models which incorporated the first - order phase transition between the quark - gluon plasma and hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "the main success of this approach was the correct reproduction of the hadron transverse - momentum spectra and the elliptic - flow coefficient @xmath0 . on the other hand , the hydrodynamic models using the first - order phase transition had severe problems with the reproduction of pionic correlation functions .",
    "the latter contain the information about the space - time dimensions of hadronic systems formed in the collisions .",
    "thus , the evident _ successes _ in the reproduction of the hadron _ momentum distributions _ were obscured by the _ failures _ connected with the analysis of the _ space - time dimensions _ of the produced system .",
    "the large part of those difficulties , known in the literature as the hbt puzzle , was removed by the use of the eos with the crossover phase transition @xcite .",
    "the crossover phase transition is not a genuine phase transition  all thermodynamic parameters change smoothly as functions of the temperature , however , such changes may be quite sudden in a narrow temperature range . the crossover phase transition _ without _ a distinct _ soft point _",
    "( i.e. , without a thermodynamic region where the ratio of pressure and energy density is very small and the sound velocity possibly drops to zero ) leads to a faster time development of the system and helps to reproduce the correlation data .",
    "the use of the simple bag eos ( leading to the first - order phase transition ) in the hydrodynamic equations describing heavy - ion collisions is very much reminiscent of the situation in the cosmological calculations where , in most cases , the strongly - interacting matter is treated in the same naive way .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to search for the effects of using the realistic qcd eos in the friedmann equation . in particular , the results of the lattice simulations of qcd with physical quark masses , which suggest the crossover rather than the first - order phase transition , should be incorporated in such analyses .",
    "the work in this direction has been recently done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the lattice results from @xcite were used .",
    "our present approach also uses the lattice results but differs from ref .",
    "@xcite in several important aspects .",
    "firstly , we use different lattice results as an input @xcite .",
    "secondly , our eos is not based exclusively on the lattice results . at lower temperatures we use the realistic hadron - gas model , which turned out to be very successful in the thermodynamic analyses of hadron production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the results of the hadron - gas model at lower temperatures are combined with the lattice results at higher temperatures in the thermodynamically consistent way described in @xcite .",
    "however , the most attractive feature of our eos is the fact that it was successfully implemented in 2 + 1 @xcite and 3 + 1 @xcite hydrodynamic codes describing heavy - ion collisions .",
    "thus , in our case the knowledge from heavy - ion physics is transferred directly to cosmology .",
    "we note that an eos sharing very similar features to ours has been very recently constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we consider the time development of the energy density fluctuations using the theory developed by schmid , schwarz , and widerin @xcite . by doing explicit numerical calculations",
    "we show that small inhomogeneities of the strongly interacting matter are moderately ( by about 30% ) damped during the realistic crossover transition .",
    "altogether , our results indicate that there are small chances for observation exotic phenomena connected usually with the first order phase transitions ( the latter are discussed , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "the qcd eos used in this paper was introduced and discussed in greater detail in ref . @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", it interpolates between the hadron - gas results and the lattice results .",
    "all thermodynamic properties follow from the temperature dependence of the sound velocity @xmath1 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs2 ] .",
    "the smooth dependence of the sound velocity on the temperature indicates that there is no genuine phase transition in the system . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2 has a characteristic minimum at @xmath3 170 mev .",
    "this behavior reflects the presence of the sharp crossover in this region , i.e. , the region where the energy density increases strongly within a narrow range of temperature .",
    "we stress that the values of @xmath1 differ from 1/3 .",
    "this indicates that the matter under consideration does not behave like an ideal gas of massless particles .",
    "various thermodynamic quantities characterizing our qcd eos may be obtained from the thermodynamic identities valid at zero baryon chemical potential @xmath4 here @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the energy density , pressure , temperature , and entropy density , respectively . in fig .",
