    "the evolutionary status of low - metallicity blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies has been debated for decades , ever since the pioneering paper by searle , sargent & bagnuolo ( 1973 ) .",
    "are bcds truly young systems where star formation is occurring for the first time or are they old galaxies with an old underlying stellar population on which the current starburst is superposed ?",
    "an argument in favor of their youth would be their heavy element abundance which ranges between @xmath5/50 and @xmath5/3 , placing them among the least chemically evolved galaxies in the universe .",
    "on the other hand , subsequent surface photometric studies have shown that the majority of bcds are not young and that they have experienced star formation episodes in the past .",
    "loose & thuan ( 1985 ) found that @xmath8 95 % bcds in their sample exhibit an underlying red extended low surface brightness component , on which are superposed the high surface brightness star - forming regions .",
    "later ccd surveys of bcds have confirmed and strengthened that initial result ( kunth , maurogordato & vigroux 1988 ; papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ; telles & terlevich 1997 ) .    however , there are at least two known bcds with extremely young stellar populations .",
    "they are the two most - metal deficient galaxies known , i zw 18 ( @xmath5/50 ) and sbs 0335052 ( @xmath5/41 ) .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging to @xmath0 @xmath8 26 of i zw 18 by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) suggests that the stellar population is dominated by young stars and that the colors of the underlying diffuse component are consistent with those from a sea of unresolved b or early a stars , with no evidence for stars older than @xmath8 10@xmath13 yr . the bcd sbs 0335052 was first shown by izotov et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to possess an extraordinarily low metallicity .",
    "_ hst _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 imaging of this galaxy ( thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1997 ) show blue @xmath11 colors not only in the region of current star formation , but also in the extended , low - surface - brightness envelope some 4 kpc in diameter .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and papaderos et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that @xmath8 1/3 of the emission from the underlying component , with color @xmath11 = 0.0 - 0.2 , comes from ionized gas while the remaining 2/3 come from young stars not older than @xmath8 10@xmath14 yr . another piece of evidence in favor of the youth of sbs 0335052 is provided by thuan & izotov ( 1997 ) . from _",
    "uv spectrophotometry , they found that sbs 0335052 is a damped ly@xmath7 system with an extremely high neutral hydrogen column density @xmath15(h i ) = 7 @xmath16 10@xmath17 @xmath18 , suggesting a large amount of neutral gas around the galaxy .",
    "in fact , a very large array ( vla ) map of sbs 0335052 does show the presence of a large extended h i cloud , 64 kpc by 24 kpc in size , and with mass @xmath8 10@xmath19 @xmath20 , some two orders of magnitude larger than the observed stellar mass ( pustilnik et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there are two prominent , slightly - resolved h i peaks separated by 22 kpc , one of which is associated with sbs 0335052 , and the other with a fainter dwarf galaxy , which is even slightly more metal - deficient ( @xmath5/50 , lipovetsky et al .",
    "thuan & izotov ( 1997 ) have argued that the h i envelope may be truly primordial , unpolluted by heavy elements .",
    "the above observational evidence suggests that there may be truly young dwarf galaxies in the local universe which started to make stars for the first time less than about 100 myr ago .",
    "the study of such young galaxies is important not only for their intrinsic interest , but also for understanding galaxy formation at high redshift .",
    "their proximity allows studies of their structure , metal content and stellar populations with a sensitivity , precision and spatial resolution that faint , small and distant high - redshift galaxies do not allow .",
    "we have therefore started a search for other young galaxies among the most metal - deficient bcds known . in that search , we were guided by the work of izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) who have argued that chemical abundances in bcds can put constraints on their age .",
    "their conclusion , based on the behavior of the c / o and n / o ratios as a function of o abundance , is that all galaxies with 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath12 7.6 ( @xmath5/20 ) began to form stars less than @xmath8 100 myr ago .",
    "a most attractive candidate is the bcd sbs 1415 + 437 @xmath3 cg 387 , which possesses a metallicity of only @xmath5/21 and which is near enough ( @xmath21 = 607 km s@xmath10 ) to allow resolution into stars .",
    "its general characteristics are shown in table 1 . at the distance of 11.4 mpc adopted for sbs 1415 + 437 , 1corresponds to 55 pc .",
    "we report here new multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) spectroscopy , _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) uv and optical spectroscopy and wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 imaging of the bcd .",

    "we describe the mmt and _ hst _ observations in  2 .",
    "the heavy element and helium abundances are derived in  3 .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas are discussed in  4 . in  5 we discuss the stellar populations in sbs 1415 + 437 .",
    "we summarize our findings in  6 .",
    "spectrophotometric observations of sbs 1415 + 437 with a signal - to - noise ratio s / n = 30 in the continuum were obtained with the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) on the night of 1997 may 1 .",
    "the observations were made with the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph using a highly - optimized loral 3072 @xmath16 1024 ccd detector .",
    "a 15 @xmath16 180  slit was used along with a 500 g / mm grating in first order and an l38 second - order blocking filter .",
    "this gives a spatial scale along the slit of 0.3 arcsec  pixel@xmath10 , a scale perpendicular to the slit of 1.9   pixel@xmath10 , a spectral range of 36007300   and a spectral resolution of @xmath8 7   fwhm .",
    "for these observations , ccd rows were binned by a factor of 2 , yielding a final spatial sampling of 0.6 arcsec  pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the observations cover in a single frame the full spectral range , with all the lines of interest from [ o ii ] @xmath93727 to [ o ii ] @xmath97330 .",
    "furthermore , they have sufficient spectral resolution to separate [ o iii ] @xmath94363 from nearby h@xmath22 and to distinguish between narrow nebular and broad wolf - rayet emission lines .",
    "the total exposure time was 90 minutes and was broken up into 3 subexposures , 30 minutes each , to allow for more effective cosmic - ray removal .",
    "all exposures were taken at small airmasses ( @xmath12 1.05 ) , so no correction was made for atmospheric dispersion .",
    "the seeing during the observations was 1   fwhm .",
    "the slit was oriented in the direction with position angle 22 , along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star hz 44 was observed for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he  ne  ar comparison lamps were obtained before and after each observation to provide wavelength calibration .",
    "data reduction of the spectral observations was carried out at the noao headquarters in tucson using the iraf software package .",
    "this included bias subtraction , cosmic - ray removal and flat - field correction using exposures of a quartz incandescent lamp .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed for the 2-dimensional spectrum by constructing dispersion curves for successive 30 pixels wide regions along the slit , using the comparison spectrum .",
    "the amplitude of the scatter of the points around each dispersion curve is @xmath12 0.1  .",
    "we then correct the spectrum for distortion and tilt and obtain the wavelength - calibrated two - dimensional spectrum by using the iraf routine transform .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength calibration along the slit was checked by measuring the wavelength of the bright night sky line [ o i ] @xmath95577 .",
    "we found the dispersion of the measured wavelengths to be @xmath8 0.06  , equivalent to velocity errors of @xmath8 3 km s@xmath10 .",
    "after night sky background subtraction , and correcting for atmospheric extinction , each frame was calibrated to absolute fluxes . to derive the sensitivity curve ,",
    "we have fitted the observed spectral energy distribution of the bright hot white dwarf standard star hz 44 with a high - order polynomial . because the spectrum of hz 44 has only a small number of relatively weak absorption features , its spectral energy distribution is known with the very good precision of @xmath8 1 % ( oke 1990 ) .",
    "we were thus able to derive a sensitivity curve with a precision of @xmath8 1 % over the whole optical range , except in the region blueward of [ o ii ] @xmath93727 where the sensitivity drops precipitously .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted by summing , without weighting , of different numbers of rows along the slit depending on the exact region of interest .",

    "the heavy element abundances in sbs 1415 + 437 corresponding to the two mmt apertures and those corresponding to the _ hst _ fos aperture are shown in table 3 .",
    "they are in very good general agreement with the values derived by izotov & thuan ( 1998b , 1999 ) from 4-meter kitt peak telescope observations .",
    "in particular , the oxygen abundance derived by izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) is 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.59 @xmath4 0.01",
    ". the ratios of @xmath7-process elements ne , s , ar abundances to o abundance are in very good agreement with the mean values derived for low - metallicity blue compact galaxies by thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1995 , hereafter til95 ) and izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) .",
    "we find that the n / o ratios derived from both mmt spectra ( log ( n / o ) = 1.54 @xmath4 0.03 and 1.55 @xmath4 0.03 ) are in agreement with the mean value log ( n / o ) = 1.53 @xmath4 0.08 derived by til95 for their sample of very metal - deficient bcds , but are slightly higher than the value 1.58 @xmath4 0.02 derived by izotov & thuan ( 1998b ) for this galaxy from 4-meter kitt peak telescope observations .",
    "the small difference may be due to a larger contamination in the lower spectral resolution mmt spectrum of the [ n ii ] @xmath96584 emission line by the strong nearby h@xmath7 @xmath96563 emission line . in spite of these small subtle differences , all determinations of the n / o ratio in sbs 1415 + 437 are in agreement within the errors .",
    "hence , sbs 1415 + 437 falls within the narrow range of n / o ratios found in other low - metallicity bcds . for bcds with 12 + log ( o / h )",
    "@xmath12 7.6 , til95 and izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) found that the dispersion about the mean of the n / o ratio is remarkably small , being only 0.02 dex .",
    "the constancy of n / o with o abundance implies that n and o share the same origin .",
    "moreover , the very small dispersion is strong evidence against time - delayed production of primary n and supports the view that primary n in galaxies with @xmath51 @xmath12 @xmath5/20 is produced by massive ( @xmath52 @xmath53 9 @xmath20 ) stars only .",
    "intermediate - mass ( 3 @xmath20 @xmath12 @xmath52 @xmath12 9 @xmath20 ) stars in those galaxies have not had time enough to evolve to contribute primary n. hence , the observed n / o ratio in sbs 1415 + 437 implies that it is a young galaxy with an age not exceeding @xmath8 100 myr ( the lifetime of a 9 @xmath20 star being @xmath8 40 myr ) .",
    "another important age discriminator is the fe / o ratio . while oxygen is produced only by massive stars , production of iron",
    "occurs not only during explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars , but also in sne i about 1 gyr after the beginning of star formation in the bcd . in the latter case",
    "a nearly solar fe / o ratio is expected .",
    "however , til95 and izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have shown that at low metallicities ( 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath12 8.2 ) , o is overproduced with respect to fe as compared to the solar neighbohrhood . the mean value [ o / fe ] (= log ( o / fe )  log ( o / fe)@xmath54 ) for low - metallicity bcds is 0.32 @xmath4 0.11 ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) and compares well with values observed in milky way halo stars ( til95 ) . in sbs 1415 + 437 ,",
    "we find [ o / fe ] = 0.27 @xmath4 0.03 and 0.30 @xmath4 0.07 respectively for the large and small apertures .",
    "these values are consistent within the errors with the mean value for low - metallicity bcds , although the value for the small aperture is more uncertain due to the weakness of [ fe iii ] @xmath94658 emission line and its possible contamination by the wolf - rayet c iv @xmath94658 line .",
    "the second possibility is less likely however , as no other broad wolf - rayet lines are seen in the small aperture spectrum .",
    "the high [ o / fe ] value seen in sbs 1415 + 437 as compared to the solar neighborhood also suggests a small age for this galaxy , although it can be explained , in principle , by depletion of iron into dust grains .",
    "further chemical constraints on the age of sbs 1415 + 437 come from _ hst _ fos spectroscopy .",
    "we show the c / o abundance ratio vs. oxygen abundance in figure 3a and the si / o abundance ratio vs. oxygen abundance in figure 3b .",
    "the filled circle represents sbs 1415 + 437 while open circles represent data from izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) .",
    "the silicon - to - oxygen abundance ratio in sbs 1415 + 437 ( log ( si / o ) = 1.46 @xmath4 0.27 ) agrees well with the solar value ( log ( si / o)@xmath54 = 1.38 ) .",
    "it is independent of o abundance as expected since both si and o have the same origin : they are both produced by high - mass stars .",
    "although errors in the determinations of the si abundances are still large , there is no evidence for significant depletion of silicon into dust grains as suggested by garnett et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "this would argue for no depletion of iron in sbs 1415 + 437 as well .    while silicon is produced only by high - mass stars",
    ", carbon is a primary element produced by both intermediate and high - mass stars .",
    "therefore , the c / o ratio is a sensitive indicator of the age of a galaxy ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "figure 3a shows that the value of log(c / o ) = 0.78 @xmath4 0.10 in sbs 1415 + 437 is in good agreement with those derived for other low - metallicity bcds with 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath12 7.6 ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) . the observed log ( c / o ) in sbs 1415 + 437 is consistent with the value of @xmath8 0.83 predicted by the theory of massive star nucleosynthesis ( weaver & woosley 1993 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) and with log ( c / o ) observed in halo stars ( tomkin et al .",
    "this suggests that the carbon seen in the bcd has been made by high - mass stars only , and that intermediate - mass stars have not had enough time to evolve and add their own c contribution . as in the case of n / o , the value of the c / o ratio allows us to say that the first star formation in sbs 1415 + 437 has not occurred more than @xmath8 100 myr ago .    in summary ,",
    "the analysis of the relative heavy element abundance ratios in sbs 1415 + 437 has led us to an important conclusion : all observed species have been made by massive stars .",

    "walsh & roy ( 1987 , 1989 ) found the n / o ratio in different knots in the starburst galaxy ngc 5253 to vary by factors of up to 3 and that these variations are associated with the presence of wolf - rayet stars of wn type .",
    "a more extreme case is that of the bcd mkn 996 ( thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1996 ) where the n / o ratio in the extremely compact central part of the galaxy is a factor of @xmath8 25 greater than the mean value found in bcds , and decreases steeply outward . local nitrogen enrichment in mkn 996",

    "we conclude that in sbs 1415 + 437 just as in sbs 0335052 , the elemental abundances do not vary within the errors , although the spatial scales probed are smaller . in subsection 3.2 , we have concluded that the h ii regions in sbs 1415 + 437 are most likely enriched by the products of nucleosynthesis in massive stars . since the lifetime of massive stars is in the range 10@xmath59  10@xmath13 yr , the time scale for the enrichment of the ionized gas with heavy elements is also of the same order .",
    "the constancy of the heavy element abundances is consistent with a scenario of self - enrichment of the gas followed by rapid mixing .",
    "a scenario of self - enrichment of giant h ii regions has been proposed by kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) , who suggested that new heavy element ejecta from supernovae of type ii and stellar winds initially mix exclusively with the ionized gas in the h ii zone , while further mixing with the cold gas happens only later during the long interburst phase .",
    "roy & kunth ( 1995 ) have analyzed different mechanisms of interstellar medium mixing and found that the ionized gas is well mixed due to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholz instabilities on time scales of @xmath8 1.5 @xmath16 10@xmath59 yr within regions of @xmath8 100 pc size .",
    "the enriched gas in the h ii regions can be easily transported by expanding shells of supernovae and stellar winds in a short time scale .",

    ". one of the main mechanism is collisional excitation from the metastable 2@xmath36s level .",
    "this mechanism depends on the electron temperature and electron number density .",

    "the emission lines most sensitive to this fluorescence mechanism are he i @xmath93889 and @xmath97065 .",
    "in contrast to collisional enhancement , which increases the intensities of all he i lines , the fluorescence mechanism works in such a way as to decrease the intensity of the he i @xmath93889 line as its optical depth increases , while increasing the intensities of other lines of interest ( he i @xmath94471 , @xmath95876 , @xmath96678 and @xmath97065 ) . and , finally , underlying he i stellar absorption lines produced by o and b stars which decrease the he i emission line intensities , has to be taken into account . to correct the he i emission line intensities for collisional and fluorescent enhancement we follow the approach described by itl97 and izotov & thuan ( 1998b ) .",
    "we assume that the electron temperature in the he@xmath42 zone is equal to that in the o@xmath35 zone .",

    "thus our cmds can not be used to exclude the presence of an old agb stellar population .",
    "they can only provide a useful consistency check for stellar population ages derived by other techniques .",
    "thus , the young ages inferred for the detected stars in region iii from its cmd are in good agreement with those derived from the blue integrated @xmath11 color of 0.07 mag obtained by surface photometry ( table 5 ) and with those obtained from modeling the spectral energy distributions ( subsection 5.3 ) .",
    "the stellar populations in regions iv to vi are similar to those in region iii except that the very youngest population with age less 10 myr is not present ( figures 14 d - f ) .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models considered in subsection 5.3 give also an age @xmath12 100 myr for regions iv to vi . from the cmd analysis , there is clear evidence for propagating star formation in sbs 1415 + 437 from the ne ( region vi ) to the sw ( region i ) .",
    "the cmds show an evident trend of increasing age from region i to region vi . on smaller spatial scales ,",
    "the same propagating star formation is seen within region iii where the brightest stars are distributed along a line in the ne - sw direction ( figure 6 ) , with increasing age from the sw to ne ( figure 9 ) .",
    "stronger evidence in favor of the evolutionary youth of sbs 1415 + 437 is provided by the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of regions iii through vi as shown in figure 15 .",
    "all spectra are very blue .",
    "the spectrum of region iii ( figure 15a ) contains many nebular emission lines : evidently , the continuum is dominated by the light of a very young o star population .",
    "the spectra of the other regions ( figures 14 b - d ) indicate older populations : their slopes are less steep and they show strong hydrogen balmer absorption lines characteristic of b and a stars .",
    "to estimate quantitatively the age of each region , we calculate a grid of seds for stellar populations with ages varying between 10 myr and 20 gyr and with a heavy element abundance @xmath5/20 , following the method described in papaderos et al .",
    "briefly , we use isochrones of stellar parameters from bertelli et al . ( 1994 ) and the compilation of stellar atmosphere models from lejeune , cuisinier & buser ( 1998 ) . a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with slope 2.35 ,",
    "an upper mass limit of 100 @xmath20 and a lower mass limit of 0.6 @xmath20 were adopted . for stellar populations with age less than 10 myr ,",
    "we use the theoretical seds of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) corresponding to a heavy element mass fraction @xmath5/20 and a salpeter imf .",
    "the stellar emission in sbs 1415 + 437 is contaminated by ionized gas emission from supergiant h ii regions .",
    "therefore , to study the stellar populations in sbs 1415 + 437 it is necessary to construct a synthetic sed which includes both stellar and ionized gaseous emission .",
    "we have chosen not to calculate the contribution of ionized gas emission from the model value for the lyman continuum luminosity . instead , we add the gaseous spectral energy distribution derived from the observed line fluxes and equivalent widths , along with the observed emission lines in the spectral range @xmath93700  7500  , to the calculated stellar spectral energy distribution .",
    "the gaseous emission contribution is scaled to the stellar emission by the ratio of the observed h@xmath25 equivalent width to the one expected for pure gaseous emission .",
    "the contribution of bound - free , free - free , two - photon continuum emission has been taken into account for the spectral range from 0 to 5 @xmath95 m ( aller 1984 ; ferland 1980 ) .",
    "the effect of gaseous emission is important in region iii , but is minor in the other regions as indicated by their small h@xmath25 equivalent width .",
    "for example , @xmath28(h@xmath25 ) is only 18   in region v. we therefore neglect gaseous emission in regions iv - vi .    in order to compare the observed seds with the model seds",
    ", we need to correct the former for extinction . in many bcds ,",
    "the internal extinction derived from balmer decrements significantly exceeds the galactic extinction .",
    "this is the case for sbs 1415 + 437 where both imaging and spectroscopic data show the presence of significant internal extinction in the brightest h ii region .    in figure 16a the observed spectrum of region iii ( thin line )",
    "is shown along with the gaseous + synthetic stellar continuum produced by an instantaneous burst with age 4.7 myr ( thick line ) .",
    "the observed spectrum has been corrected for extinction , corresponding to @xmath24(h@xmath25 ) = 0.12 dex or @xmath90 = 0.08 mag as derived from the balmer decrement .",
    "the agreement between the observed and model seds is very good , except in the @xmath93600 - 3900 region where the model falls below the observed spectrum .",
    "the discrepancy is caused by the overlapping of the hydrogen balmer absorption lines in the model sed .",
    "the inclusion of the observed balmer hydrogen emission lines reduces the difference as shown in figure 16b , where the contributions of gaseous and stellar emission are shown separately .",
    "it is evident from figure 16b that the contribution of ionized gas emission to the total sed is significant in star - forming regions .",
    "this contribution is dependent on the equivalent width of h@xmath25 and the observed fluxes of other emission lines relative to h@xmath25 .",
    "we present in table 5 the model colors of a single stellar population with age 4.7 myr .",
    "the calculated and observed @xmath11 colors agree very well .",
    "thus the bulk of the stellar population in region iii is very young ( @xmath8 5 myr ) , although stars as old as 100 myr are also present , as shown by the cmd of this region ( fig .",
    "however , the contribution of the older stars to the total light is negligible .    extinction correction is more of a problem when hydrogen emission lines are not present in the spectrum .",
    "regions iv , v and vi are characterized by nearly identical spectral energy distributions ( fig .",
    "however , only in region v are hydrogen emission lines present with a good enough signal - to - noise ratio to allow for the correction of internal extinction .",
    "therefore only in that region can we derive the age of the stellar population . to illustrate the effect of extinction on the derived age , we consider in turn both the extinction - uncorrected and corrected cases . as the reddening for the stellar continuum can be different ( and is usually smaller ) than that derived from the balmer lines in the ionized gas ( e.g. calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) , the real situation lies somewhere between these two limiting cases .",
    "however , the following arguments show that the truth is closer to the case with extinction derived from the balmer lines than to the case with no extinction .",
    "figure 17a shows the spectrum of region v uncorrected for extinction , along with model seds for three different ages log @xmath47 ( yr ) = 7.5 , 8.0 and 8.1 .",
    "the large difference between the model seds at log @xmath47 = 8.0 and 8.1 is due to the appearance of the first agb stars in the latter case .",
    "the best fit is obtained for the model with log @xmath47 = 8.1 .",
    "we present in table 6 the model colors calculated for a single stellar population with log @xmath47 varying between 7.2 and 8.1 .",
    "it can be seen that the calculated @xmath11 color of 0.79 mag for the age log @xmath47 = 8.1 is inconsistent with the color of @xmath8 0.4 derived from the hst images ( this is the color of the flat part of the ( @xmath80 ) color profile in fig .",
    "11b ) and uncorrected for interstellar extinction .",
    "this is not too surprising as the extinction derived for region v from the balmer decrement is high : @xmath24(h@xmath25 ) = 0.26 dex , equivalent to @xmath91 = 0.55 mag and @xmath92 = 0.41 mag .",
    "figure 17b shows the extinction - corrected spectrum of region v with four model seds corresponding to log @xmath47 = 7.2 , 7.5 , 8.0 and 8.1 .",
    "the best agreement between observation and model is achieved for a sed with log @xmath47 between 7.2 and 8.0 .",
    "these ages give a range of model @xmath11 colors between 0.21 and 0.43 , which does include the observed color of 0.25 , corrected for the interstellar extinction .",
    "interpolating between the two colors gives log @xmath47 = 7.25 ( see also table 6 ) .",
    "the above analysis shows the importance of extinction correction for age determination .",
    "had we not corrected for extinction we would have derived an age log @xmath47 = 8.1 instead of log @xmath47 = 7.3 , i.e we would have overestimated the age by some 60 myr . extinction correction in region v makes stars brighter by 0.6 mag in @xmath0 and by 0.4 mag in @xmath1 , and red stars lie in the young supergiant region rather in the agb region ( fig .",
    "we stress here that evolutionary synthesis is a very sensitive technique for determining ages of stellar populations .",
    "we have used it to obtain ages of 5 and @xmath8 20 myr for regions iii and v , respectively .",
    "as the seds for regions iv and vi are very similar to that of region v ( fig .",
    "15 ) , it is likely that their stellar populations have ages of @xmath8 20  100 myr .",
    "thus , the analysis of stellar populations in sbs 1415 + 437 using evolutionary synthesis models has also led us to the conclusion that the galaxy is young .",
    "star formation in the bcd did not start until @xmath8 100 myr ago .",
    "this finding supports the conclusion of izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) based on the analysis of chemical abundances in a large sample of bcds that all galaxies with metallicities @xmath12 @xmath5/20 are young , with ages less than @xmath8 100 myr .",

    "analysis of a very high signal - to - noise ratio long - slit mmt spectrum and of new _ hst _ fos spectroscopy and wfpc2 imaging of the bcd has led us to the conclusion that sbs 1415 + 437 is a nearby _ young _ dwarf galaxy experiencing now its first burst of star formation which did not start until @xmath8 100 myr ago . in particular , we have obtained the following results :    \\1 .",

    "the @xmath7-elements - to - oxygen abundance ratios ne / o , s / o , ar / o in sbs 1415 + 437 are in very good agreement with the mean ratios for the most metal - deficient blue compact galaxies derived by izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) . for the largest aperture , we derive log ( ne / o ) = 0.75 @xmath4 0.02 as compared to the mean value 0.75 @xmath4 0.03 , log ( s / o ) = 1.58 @xmath4 0.02 as compared to the mean value 1.59 @xmath4 0.04 , and log ( ar / o ) = 2.30 @xmath4 0.03 as compared to the mean value 2.22 @xmath4 0.07 .",

    "<S> we use multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) spectrophotometry and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectra and wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 images to study the properties and evolutionary status of the nearby ( @xmath2 = 11.4 mpc ) extremely metal - deficient blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy sbs 1415 + 437 @xmath3 cg 389 . </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen abundance in the galaxy is 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.60 @xmath4 0.01 or @xmath5/21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the helium mass fraction in sbs 1415 + 437 is @xmath6 = 0.246 @xmath4 0.004 which agrees with the primordial helium abundance determined by izotov & thuan using a much larger sample of bcds . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7-elements - to - oxygen abundance ratios ( ne / o , s / o , ar / o ) are in very good agreement with the mean values for other metal - deficient bcds and are consistent with the scenario that these elements are made in massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> the fe / o abundance ratio is @xmath8 2 times smaller than the solar ratio . the si / o ratio is close to the solar value , implying that silicon is not significantly depleted into dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the n / o and c / o ratios imply that intermediate - mass stars have not had time to evolve in sbs 1415 + 437 and release their nucleosynthesis products and that both n and c in the bcd have been made by massive stars only . </S>",
    "<S> this sets an upper limit of @xmath8 100 myr on the age of sbs 1415 + 437 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 and @xmath1 surface brightness profiles of sbs 1415 + 437 are well fitted by exponentials implying that the galaxy is a disk - like system . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity distribution derived from the h@xmath7 and [ o iii ] @xmath95007 emission lines indicates a solid - body rotation with a rotational velocity of 80 km s@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical mass is @xmath8 13 times larger than the gas mass , implying that most of the mass in sbs 1415 + 437 is in the form of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 color of the low - surface - brightness component of the galaxy is blue ( @xmath12 0.4 mag ) indicative of a very young underlying stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 - @xmath1 color - magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar populations in different regions of sbs 1415 + 437 suggest propagating star formation from the ne side of the galaxy to the sw . </S>",
    "<S> all regions in sbs 1415 + 437 possess very blue spectral energy distributions ( sed ) . by comparing the observed seds to theoretical seds which include both stellar and gaseous emission , we find that the ages of the stellar populations in sbs 1415 + 437 to range from a few myr to 100 myr </S>",
    "<S> . thus chemical abundances , color profiles and spectral energy distributions all say that sbs 1415 + 437 is a truly young galaxy which did not start to make stars until @xmath8 100 myr ago .    </S>",
