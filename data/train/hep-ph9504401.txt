    ". such non - standard physics would lead to new gluon self - interactions through virtual loops of heavy colored particles or through exchange of sub - components .",
    "a _ complete _ description of a given set of new phenomena would require a fundamental theory beyond the standard model .",
    "but at low energies @xmath4 , where the underlying preon exchange or loops of new particles can not be resolved , the new color physics causes multi - gluon contact interactions suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath2 .",
    "these contact interactions are described by an effective lagrangian _ eff = l_qcd + 1 ^2 _ i _ i ( ) _ i ( ) + 1 ^ 4 _",
    "i _ i ( ) _ i ( ) + o(1 ^6 ) that includes the conventional qcd lagrangian plus non - renormalizable operators @xmath5 that are constructed from gluon field strengths @xmath6 or color - covariant derivatives @xmath7 .",
    "the new operators obey the gauge and global symmetries of the standard model .",
    "our task is to identify the leading operators in this effective lagrangian and determine which experiments are best able to detect their effects .",
    "since a non - renormalizable operator of dimension @xmath9 is suppressed by @xmath10 , the operators making the most visible contribution to physical processes will be those of lowest dimension .",
    "the number of nonrenormalizable terms which arise at dimension 6 in the gluon sector is small .",
    "one can build only two gauge - invariant operators preserving @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 out of covariant derivatives and gluon field strengths @xcite : _ 1 & = & g_s f_abc g^_a g^_b g^_c [ dimsixopsa ] + _ 2 & = & 1 2 d^g^a _ d_g^_a .

    "see @xcite ) we merely mention that there are two situations in which dimension-8 operators may give noticeable effects .",

    "the effect of this operator on angular distributions will feature in our discussion of @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the four - field - strength operators contribute significantly to the gluon four - point vertex and , hence , the process @xmath20 which we will analyze shortly .",
    "having established our operator basis , we consider how best to detect the presence of non - standard gluon self - interactions . in principle , the operator @xmath0 , being the lowest - dimension operator to affect multi - point gluon vertices , is the one to focus on . a logical beginning is to consider its effects on hadronic scattering at high - energy colliders like fnal and the lhc .",
    "because scattering at both colliders is dominated by gluon - gluon collisions , one expects non - standard gluon self - interactions to noticeably affect two - body scattering cross - sections .",
    "these cross - sections , in turn , dominate the well - measured ( at fnal ) inclusive single - jet production cross - section .",
    "hence , it appears that a strong limit on the coefficient @xmath21 should be forthcoming .",
    "the leading contribution of the @xmath0 operator to the inclusive jet cross - section @xmath22 is expected to lie in its effect on the sub - process @xmath20 .",
    "consider the feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath23 scattering amplitude in pure qcd and those with one insertion of @xmath0 ( i.e. , one anomalous multi - gluon vertex per diagram ) .",
    "the ordinary qcd contribution to the scattering comes from squaring the sum of the qcd diagrams ; the lowest - order ( @xmath24 ) piece due to @xmath0 arises from the interference of the qcd and one - insertion diagrams .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , however , that the qcd amplitude is only in the @xmath25 $ ] helicity channel and the one - insertion amplitude is purely in the orthogonal @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] channels .",
    "there is , consequently , no order @xmath28 contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "the leading effect of the @xmath0 operator arises at order @xmath16 , from squaring the one - insertion diagrams and from interfering two - insertion diagrams with the qcd diagrams .    where a lower - order effect is missing , one would hope to experimentally detect the remaining higher - order effect",
    ". this will be difficult .",
    "the leading contributions of the dimension - eight four - field - strength operators to @xmath20 also arise at order @xmath16 when an amplitude with one insertion of a dimension - eight operator interferes with a qcd amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the order @xmath16 contributions to gluon scattering of the operators @xmath0 and @xmath29 are identical in form and similar in magnitude@xcite . isolating the effects of @xmath0 in @xmath30 does not appear possible .",
    "the next most promising sub - processes appear to be those involving massless quarks as well as gluons , i.e. @xmath31 and reactions related to it by crossing .",
    "initial state gluons are still a possibility and @xmath0 can enter some diagrams through the three - gluon vertex .",
    "when the contribution of @xmath0 is calculated , however , the order @xmath32 piece vanishes .",
    "the leading effects are , again , order @xmath16 and compete with the effects of higher - dimension operators .    in summary :",
    "two - body scattering of massless partons does not put significant limits on non - standard gluon self - interactions involving the @xmath0 operator . because the leading effects are of order @xmath16",
    ", there is competition from higher - dimension operators .",
    "furthermore , the fact that gluons predominate at low @xmath33 where the qcd background is greatest weakens the attainable bounds@xcite .",
    "while the @xmath0 operator can not be detected in @xmath34 light parton scattering processes , there are several other options for studying non - standard strong interactions using massless final - state jets .",
    "as will become clear , none is fully satisfactory .",
    "although @xmath0 does not affect dijet production at tree level , the other dimension - six operator , @xmath14 can . as noted earlier , this operator alters the propagator and coupling of internal gluons . at leading order its effects on scattering",
    "are equivalent to those of the four - quark operator @xmath35 .",
    "consider , for example , the process @xmath36 , to which dijet production is the leading contributor . at fnal ,",
    "initial quarks play a larger role than initial gluons in scattering at large bjorken @xmath33 ; thus high @xmath37 jets are more likely to originate from initial quarks .",
    "the inclusive jet cross - section is found to fall more slowly with @xmath38 or @xmath37 when an insertion of the @xmath14 operator is included than when only qcd is studied @xcite .",
    "this makes the transverse - momentum spectrum potentially sensitive to the presence of the @xmath14 operator .",
    "analyzing published cdf inclusive jet data @xcite yields a lower bound of 2 tev on the scale of new physics associated with this operator@xcite .",
    "this limit is useful  but because no external gluons are involved , it is only tangentially related to probing the structure of the gluon self - coupling .    at lep , one source of 4-jet final states",
    "is the process wherein a @xmath39 decay to a quark / anti - quark pair is followed by radiation of a gluon that splits into a pair of gluons .",
    "the three - gluon vertex involved in this process can be affected by the presence of the @xmath0 operator . in @xcite",
    "it was found that while most kinematic variables describing @xmath40 would reflect the presence of @xmath0 only in the overall _ rate _ , the dijet invariant mass distribution of the two most energetic jets changes _",
    "shape _ when the @xmath0 operator is included . with 10pb@xmath41 of data",
    ", it should be possible to set a limit of @xmath42 100 gev using this dijet invariant mass distribution ; ten times the data would boost the limit to 175 gev .",
    "the limiting factor is the energy at which lep experiments are performed .",
    "while the order @xmath32 contributions of the @xmath0 operator to dijet production vanish at tree level , the same is not true when larger numbers of jets are being produced .",
    "the very difference in helicity properties between the scattering amplitudes of pure qcd and those with one insertion of @xmath0 which keeps the @xmath34 amplitudes from interfering provides a potential signal of the presence of @xmath0 in @xmath43 processes @xcite .",
    "for example , if one considers @xmath44 when two of the outgoing gluons are nearly collinear one observes the following .",
    "treating the nearby gluons as one effective gluon yields an approximate @xmath45 process for which we know the helicity properties of scattering amplitudes with and without @xmath0 .",
    "the pure qcd amplitude with its @xmath25 $ ] helicity is symmetric under azimuthal rotations about the momentum vector of the effective gluon .",
    "the amplitude with an insertion of @xmath0 admits the @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] helicities which allows the effective gluon to be linearly polarized , yielding azimuthal dependence .",
    "no limits on @xmath2 have yet been suggested using this method ; the limiting factor may be the experimental difficulty of studying 3-jet events in the near - collinear region .",
    "light jets having failed us , we turn to the possibility of studying anomalous gluon self - interactions through their effects on scattering involving heavy flavors .",
    "the two - body scattering process that both involves heavy fermions and benefits maximally from the high gluon luminosity at hadron colliders is @xmath47 .",
    "we will find that the order @xmath32 contribution of @xmath0 to this process is proportional to @xmath48 ; hence the effect is greatest for top production .",
    "the top quark is also the easiest to tag since its leptonic decay channel can produce a high energy , isolated lepton in conjunction with a bottom quark .",
    "this distinctive signature cuts down on genuine backgrounds as well as false identifications . to the extent that @xmath49 and even @xmath50 final states can be cleanly identified , the signal for @xmath0 will be enhanced and our results can be applied to their study .    to study top quark production",
    ", we must enlarge our basis of higher - dimension operators .",
    "the gluonic operators described above are not the only higher - dimension operators that can affect top production .",
    "they also do not form a closed basis under one - loop renormalization , which we employ in running down from the scale of new physics to the top production threshold .",
    "the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not mix with each other under the action of qcd at one - loop order .",
    "instead , @xmath51 runs into itself and the chromomagnetic moment operator _ 0 = _",
    "flavors g_s m_q |q^ t^a q g^a_. because the equations of motion relate @xmath52 to a color - octet four - quark operator , @xmath52 mixes at one loop with other four - quark operators _ 3 & = & g_s^2 2 _ flavors ( |q_^5 t_a q ) ( |q^^5 t_a q ) + _ 4 & = & g_s^22 _ flavors ( |q_q ) ( |q^q ) + _ 5 & = & g_s^22 _ flavors ( |q_^5 q ) ( |q^^5 q ) the mixing matrices are given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "renormalization group evolution suppresses the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "given that one expects some new fundamental layer of physics to lie in the tev regime , we will take @xmath552 tev .",
    "this ensures that our analysis will be valid over almost the entire energy range of present and anticipated hadron colliders .",
    "if the operator coefficients assume the values ( _ 0,_1,_2,_3,_4,_5 ) ( ) = ( 1,1,1,0,0,0 ) at a scale of 2 tev , then they run down to the values ( 0.7858 , 0.7458 , 0.8856 , -0.0294 , 0.0003 , -0.0152 ) at the top - antitop threshold@xcite .",

    "notice that all of the nonrenormalizable operator terms except the last one are proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "because the last term is enhanced by a prefactor of @xmath60 and increases quadratically with @xmath61 , well away from the @xmath62 threshold and over large regions of @xmath53 parameter space , the @xmath51 operator s squared amplitude is much larger than its interference with qcd",

    "next in importance at large @xmath37 is @xmath14 ; the chromomagnetic magnetic operator lags far behind .",
    "placing a lower @xmath37 cut around 500 gev , can eliminate most of the chromomagnetic moment operator s contribution in favor of that from @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the shapes of the curves for @xmath0 and @xmath14 are noticeably different from one another and from the shape of the qcd curve ; that of the chromomagnetic moment operator closely mimics qcd .",
    "hence the @xmath0 operator should make the most visible contribution to @xmath83 at the lhc .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the qcd and effective lagrangian predictions for @xmath84 at the lhc confirms this @xcite . to compare rates , we computed the ratio @xmath85 of the integrals of @xmath86 and @xmath87 over the momentum range @xmath88 .",

    "the most important dimension - six operators at tevatron energies are the chromomagnetic moment operator @xmath80 and four - quark operators like @xmath14 ; the effects of @xmath0 are ( for equal values of the @xmath94 at high energies ) an order of magnitude smaller . hence fnal experiments are unlikely to find evidence for the @xmath0 operator in @xmath95 production .",
    "the effects of @xmath80 and @xmath52 may be visible in terms of enhanced production _",

    "we also required the lab frame angle between the @xmath99 or @xmath100 and the beamline to exceed @xmath101 ; this ensures that the pseudorapidities of the decay products from high momentum tops will predominantly fall within @xmath102 , the approximate acceptance of planned lhc detectors .    the angular distribution is plotted in fig . 3 for pure qcd and for qcd _ plus _ some of the @xmath5 .",

    "this is quite interesting since the effect of @xmath64 upon the @xmath62 transverse momentum distribution was negligible .",
    "indeed , we omitted the effects of @xmath64 from fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 since they would have been suppressed relative to the dimension-6 operators effects by more than an order of magnitude .    as in the analysis of the @xmath37 distributions",
