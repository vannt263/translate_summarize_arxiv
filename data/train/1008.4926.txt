    "two unruh - dewitt detectors that interact with a quantum field in the vacuum state have access to a renewable source of entanglement @xcite , namely by swapping entanglement from the quantum field . in this context , it was recently shown @xcite that , in an expanding space - time , the entanglement of the vacuum decreases significantly due to the effects of the gibbons - hawking temperature @xcite .",

    "note that since the space - time we consider is static and asymptotically flat , the propagator @xmath127 can be seen as the analytic continuation of the unique green s function on the positive definite section @xcite .",
    "since this holds order by order in perturbation theory , at first order perturbation we can use @xmath128 as the inverse of @xmath129 such that : @xmath130 this equation gives us explicitly the first order correction to the propagator .",

    ".    we may heuristically interpret this phenomenon by looking at the local noise term @xmath35 and the exchange term @xmath168 separately . since the gravitational field increases the momentum of virtual particles near the star ( as seen by the fixed detector @xmath7 ) ,",
    "it is more energetically expensive to have many of them so the local noise has to decrease . as for the exchange term , we hypothesise that it increases because the gravitational field creates a lensing effect such that more virtual particles emitted by detector 2 hit detector 1 .    as we previously mentioned this effect scales linearly with the strength of the gravitational field @xmath176 , so for detectors with @xmath177 and @xmath178 we have for the earth @xmath179 while for the sun we have @xmath180 .",
    "since entanglement swapping from the entanglement @xmath181 of the vacuum has still not been observed , we expect that observing @xmath182 will be very difficult",
    ". nevertheless , it should be interesting to see if this effect can be modeled in a quantum field analog like a linear ion trap @xcite .",
    "our calculations depended on the assumption that the vacuum of the quantum field is described by the boulware vacuum .",
    "if we had considered two unruh - dewitt detectors near a black hole in an unruh or a kruskal vacuum @xcite , the hawking temperature seen by both detectors would have increased the local noise significantly such that the entanglement between both detectors should be degraded , not enhanced .",
    "it should be interesting to investigate in detail to what extent entanglement extraction by detectors near black holes and stars is affected by the properties of the corresponding vacuum states .    in this context",
    ", it should also be interesting to investigate whether one can effectively model a black hole by using a confining potential , say on a shell .",
    "indeed , a trapping potential can have horizons , so it may be possible to have a non - trivial vacuum in which particle production occurs because of the potential .",
    "such an analysis could show the hawking effect and its various open questions in a new light .    since we observed that the exchange term @xmath168 increases because of the gravitational field",
    ", it is tempting to speculate on the casimir - polder force near a constant density star .",
    "indeed , the exchange term and the casimir - polder force have essentially the same interpretation , that is they are the result of a continuous exchange of virtual particles .",
    "we therefore conjecture that casimir or casimir - polder forces can slightly increase in a weak gravitational field .",
