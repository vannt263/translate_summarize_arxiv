    "this requires yet another exhausting search for vacancy patterns in supercells , this time starting from hexagonal and rhombohedral unit cells .",
    "given the relatively low energy position of the @xmath31 phase , especially in the lda calculation , a proper study of vacancy positions is likely to change the right - hand side of the convex hull .",
    "we also need to study the effects of pressure .",
    "does the application of pressure appreciably change the phase diagram , especially on the right - hand side ? given the extremely open nature of the ci36 structure ,",
    "even modest pressure may trigger a first - order phase transition to another structure . we also need to perform more calculations to establish the validity of the vdw - df2 functional when used in bulk systems .",
    "we will pursue these calculations in the future .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have used high - throughput density functional calculations to study the tungsten - nitrogen phase diagram , both with and without van der waals forces .",
    "our calculations agree with experiment in that the dominant structure of w - n is the nacl structure with vacancies , and show that this structure can persist over a large range of compositions .",
    "it is unlikely that many of the previously predicted nitrogen - rich phases will ever be seen experimentally , as they are well above the ground state hull .",
    "the only exceptions may be the hexagonal wn@xmath4 phases predicted by wang _",
    "et al._@xcite these are on the ground state hull when we use the lda and pbe functionals , but not when we include van der waals forces .",
    "in addition , the bulk and shear moduli of the predicted cubic ground state has rather large bulk and shear moduli , comparable with any of the previously predicted ultra - incompressible structures.@xcite",
