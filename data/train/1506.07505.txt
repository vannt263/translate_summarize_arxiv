    "the ultraviolet divergences of the amplitude diagrams in maximal supergravity @xcite have long been subject to investigations @xcite .",
    "however , while a divergent theory in @xmath0 initially seemed unavoidable , with increasing uv divergences the higher the number of loops present , the explicit 4-graviton calculations of @xcite showed a better uv behaviour at four loops than expected .",
    "the results of @xcite then showed a first possible divergence at @xmath3 for the 4-point diagram : a logarithmic divergence also discussed in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the results of @xcite also stated that , if the 4-point 7-loop would be absent , the 5-point 7-loop would be characterised by a slightly better uv behaviour , i.e. not divergent in @xmath0 at @xmath3 .",
    "this is all the more interesting in the light of the recent pure spinor investigations of @xcite . unlike other pure spinor approaches @xcite ,",
    "these are performed in a field theory setting , based on the maximal supergravity action @xcite respecting maximal supersymmetry , and where the maximal supersymmetry is kept an inherent property throughout the investigations .",
    "importantly , the results of @xcite showed a cut - off of the possible number of loops in one - particle irreducible loop structures , and because the uv divergences only are caused by such substructures , and defined by the worst separate uv behaviour thereof , @xcite effectively stated that the uv divergences only depend on the number of loops present up to @xmath4 for the 4-point amplitude , and @xmath3 for the 5-point amplitude . by the previous results stated , the possible 4-point 7-loop logarithmic divergence would be avoided , and by @xcite effectively all uv divergences in @xmath0 , a point not explicitly made in @xcite .",
    "this indicates a scenario with maximal supergravity uv finite in @xmath0 , relevant for further investigations , but in part supported by arguments in e.g. @xcite .    in this article in the @xmath5-ghost .",
    "it is possible that contributions from these nonzero modes will modify our conclusions , and we are currently investigating this .",
    "we thank nathan berkovits for pointing this out . ]",
    "we revisit the arguments in @xcite and have a further look at the uv divergences .",
    "for example , the cut - off of the loop behaviour is better interpreted as a product of the integration over loop momenta , in combination with regularisation properties . the latter which in turn can be used to give an upper limit of the uv behaviour with limits on the dimension , for finiteness , corresponding to those of @xcite , some of which were deduced through u - duality properties .",
    "perhaps the corresponding processes can give some insight into what the pure spinor formalism cancellations ought to correspond to in other approaches .",
    "it at least seems to concern u - duality properties in combination with an insensitivity to certain required transformations , in terms of the loop integrations .",
    "+   + the article is organised as follows . to begin with , a brief presentation of the pure spinor formalism and the concepts connected to the amplitude diagrams formulated in a field theory setting are given .",
    "for an extensive review of the first , see @xcite , and in terms of the latter , we refer to @xcite or , in a brief format , @xcite .",
    "we then proceed with a more extensive analysis of the restrictions on the one - particle irreducible loops structures observed in @xcite .",
    "especially , the effective operators can be limited further , as specified in , which brings about further limits on the uv divergences : a simple power - counting of the momenta present yield the correct uv divergences for @xmath6 in .",
    "this estimate , assuming an equal division of the momenta in the loop structure , clearly is a bit naive for @xmath7 , where the loop configurations begin to play an important role .",
    "this is possible to take into account through further observations of the loop regularisation properties in : a given loop , be it a part of a diagram or not , does not diverge worse when considered part of a larger loop structure than when figuring on its own , provided all contributing operator configurations are considered . in this way the momenta actually contributing to the uv divergences can be narrowed down to present results in equivalence with @xcite for @xmath8 and worst case scenarios in @xmath9 corresponding to those of @xcite , which in combination with the limits on the one - particle irreducible loop structures in @xcite indicate uv finiteness for maximal supergravity in @xmath10 .",

    "e.g. @xmath42 is nonzero only up to @xmath88 , so that @xmath71s from @xmath85 equivalently are regularised down to that number , and no further @xcite .",
    "the full regularisation provides an entity as convergent ( or divergent ) as provided by the term with @xmath89 .    with a restriction to conclusions drawn in these settings ,",
    "the analysis may proceed .",
    "in the pure spinor field theory setting , uv divergences can equivalently be analysed in terms of one - particle irreducible loop structures . this",
    "because the divergences occur in terms of the loop integrations over the loop momenta corresponding to @xmath90 , and loop momenta are not shared between loop structures merely connected by a single propagator . only the momenta ( originally ) part of a one - particle irreducible loop structure , inside the loops , share in the loop momenta and , provided a non - zero result , affect the end properties .",
    "the overall divergence of an amplitude diagram is set by the constituent one - particle irreducible loop structure diverging the most .",
    "an important feature of loop structures is that momenta acting along the loop propagators do not act out of the loop(s ) or onto anything inside the loop(s ) unless forced to .",
    "furthermore , if remaining in a loop , they must be integrated out by the loop integration in order not to constitute total derivatives , falling under the first point just listed .",
    "considering the loop integration properties mentioned after , this constrains the parts of the field theory operators ( the propagator and the operators in the 3- and 4-point vertices ) that are necessary to consider with respect to non - vanishing results .",
    "if @xmath91 can not form @xmath83 it must , just like @xmath92 , be forced to act out of the one - particle irreducible loop structure , or onto another entity inside it . in particular , the only cause for this to happen to the bosonic momenta ( @xmath72 is another matter ) is by @xmath93 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the vanishing of certain momenta can be specified further than what is done there ; further restrictions which also are valid in the @xcite discussion on the case of maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory .    to begin with ,",
    "consider a 4-point vertex as part of a one - particle irreducible loop structure .",
    "if it constitutes an outer vertex , @xmath49 can equivalently be taken to act into the loop structure , and otherwise it certainly does , resulting in an @xmath92 in the loop(s ) which invariably will constitute a total derivative .",
    "4-point vertices therefore are not part of non - zero one - particle irreducible loop structures .",
    "next , consider a @xmath5-ghost ( containing two derivatives ) acting across a vertex , i.e. from one propagator to another : @xmath94 this is a process equivalently examined with the @xmath71s remaining behind : a consideration necessary for later regularisations to be valid .",
    "also , any @xmath63s may be considered to have acted past the @xmath5s next to the vertices .",
    "if both derivatives in the @xmath5 acting across the vertex then act onto the same state , the result is zero either by @xmath95 or , as the considered entity is convergent . in this way ,",
    "@xmath5 is split onto two propagators , one of which might be an outer leg .",
    "once split , @xmath93 does not occur unless both derivatives sidle up again .",
    "anyhow , for one of the derivatives to act out , this must occur next to an outer leg ( by the initial configuration ) .",
    "there , it is equivalent to choose which of the two derivatives acts across the vertex first , and it is only the other one that is forced out . consequently , if a derivative in @xmath5 would yield zero by staying in the loop , it can be ( equivalently ) chosen to stay in the loop , with a zero result .",
    "hence , any part of the operators containing an @xmath92 gives a vanishing result , and can be disregarded at examinations .",
    "in addition , @xmath96 can not pair up into @xmath83 , so that any term proportional to it gives a vanishing expression for the same reasons as just stated for @xmath92 .",
    "the reason for its absence is due to the properties of @xmath24 , see appendix [ app.lb ]",

    "might be equivalently taken to act in .",
    "if that yields a zero due to the restrictions on @xmath72 for loop integration , this means that the term drops out .",
    "if it does not , @xmath91 can equivalently be regarded as acting out , with @xmath72 in .",
    "this presents different classes of equivalence .",
    "for example , in the 4-point 1-loop amplitude ( @xmath110 : @xmath111 ) , the only non - zero element is @xmath112 with @xmath113 ( one from each of the three - point , @xmath85-loop one - particle irreducible loop structures , @xmath108 propagators are outer ( caused by the presence of the outer legs ) provided @xmath114 . for @xmath115 ,",

    "this structure furthermore needs to provide @xmath118 to each @xmath74 $ ] for a non - zero result ; @xmath72s not originating in the regularisation of @xmath71 .",
    "the last is a both obvious and subtle feature ; at most @xmath75 can be claimed from the regulator , effectively also by regularised @xmath71s , as both provide 0- and 2-form @xmath119 , of which no more than 24 can be antisymmetrised with a non - zero result .",
    "furhtermore , the @xmath120 in question can not be paired with the @xmath119 in to form @xmath121 ; the irreducible representations do not match .",
    "rests then the statement above . however , this concerns a much larger structure than what has been dealt with up until this point , so it is best to check for its convergence .",
    "the entity @xmath120 is part of a regulator , not a singular operator ( possibly ) subject to regularisation , and does not encode any singularities .",
    "the eight operators @xmath119 , do . in the presence of fully regularised @xmath71s ,",

    "the most striking feature is that while a regularisation of @xmath71 brings about @xmath126 so that there is no difference in behaviour between @xmath109 and @xmath127 , the same is not true for @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath24 pairs up into the required irreducible representation , @xmath84 does not .",

    "consequently , it is equivalent to treat the entity without considering further regularisation .    with the conclusion shown to be valid ,",
    "it is possible to return to the requirement of @xmath141 ( original ) going into the loop integrations , claimed from the operators in the loop structure .",
    "the @xmath5-ghost can at most provide two ( on outer legs one ) @xmath72 , and the same goes for the vertices .",

    "however , since the latter forces an additional regularisation of the @xmath71s on the @xmath108-point @xmath268 sub - loop structure , the calculation really is a zero - sum game : the @xmath281 can be accommodated for ( in the case of @xmath109 by one @xmath83 being moved to the introduced loop ) .    on the other hand , any additional @xmath83 would require @xmath231 to be claimed from the @xmath268 sub - loop structure , with @xmath265 .",
    "as demonstrated during the discussion on the 4-point 4-loop structure , the base in [ fig.loopdisect]e ) and f ) , used for this estimate , is highly compact and therefore contributing with the most divergent result .",
    "in addition , the structures are the most limited by shared @xmath221s , minimal in their configurations .",
    "a saturation of the @xmath221s possible to share have already been observed , so there is no possibility of withdrawing @xmath215 without affecting the other @xmath83s of the structure .",

    "hence , by the compactness of the e ) and f ) diagrams , the overall behaviour is limited by .",
    "important to note is that it is merely a rough lower limit , which possibly might be further specified to something more allowing .",
    "for example , as at the transition between @xmath233 and @xmath252 , the full @xmath226 is not always captured .",
    "+   + the 5-point setting can be analysed in the same way . there",
    ", the question of concern is a possible finiteness in @xmath0 , i.e. at @xmath3 , as indicated in @xcite .",
    "what we thereby wish to know is if @xmath250 holds for the 5-point 4-loop one - particle irreducible substructures , but only in a 5-loop equivalent sense .",
    "that is , not the actual 5-point 4-loop behaviour , but what effectively , as above for the 4-point structure , gives the 5-point 5-loop structures . in this setting",
    ", it is equivalent to consider a general 7-point version of the 4-loop structures , with any two outer vertices removed ; the effective behaviour generated at the @xmath273 is the same .",
    "also , naturally , the 5-point 4-loops constructed out of the diagrams e ) and f ) are just as compact as the 4-point versions with respect to the formation of @xmath83 , so with an effective @xmath250 , in the equivalent setting , the overall limit would correspond to @xmath282 we will skip the finer points of the 5-point diagrams as well as trying to find out their strict divergences ; as long as the equivalent 5-point structures correspond to @xmath250 , i.e. at most @xmath226 formed , the worst possible divergence of the one - particle irreducible loop structures is given by .",
    "consider the discussion on the 4-point 4-loop one - particle irreducible loop structures right above .",
    "the 5-point versions just have one extra outer leg , and as already stated , the diagrams behave no worse than what is true for the minimal @xmath108 , so diagram c ) and d ) by default fall under @xmath250 .",
    "the real issue is the diagram e ) and f ) .",
    "however , the 5-loop structures caused by an extension of f ) are equivalently caused by an extension of e ) : any non - planar 5-loop diagram can be reduced to planar by at least six different cuts , compare e.g. to the illustration in @xcite , and in the 5-point setting at least one of those is free from outer legs .",
    "what then remains is the diagram of fig .",

    "it is possible to note that the structures with no shared outer legs at most result in the total formation of @xmath226 .",
    "the combination of a 7-point 2-loop and a 4-point 2-loop is characterised by the latter contributing with @xmath236 while requiring @xmath283 from the shared @xmath63s , reducing the former by @xmath284 to at most form @xmath226 . the other combination of a 6-point 2-loop and a 5-point 2-loop",
    "is similarly restricted : if the latter contributes with @xmath83 through regularisation or free @xmath91s , the former can not contribute with @xmath226 .",

    "in this article , the pure spinor field theory results of @xcite with respect to maximal supergravity have been revisited .",
    "the observation in @xcite of the uv divergences only depending on one - particle irreducible loop structures constructed out of propagators and 3-point vertices in terms of certain effective operators , in total constraining the non - zero @xmath108-point @xmath85-loop structures to @xmath285 has been extended to a confirmation of the limits on the dimension for finiteness : @xcite @xmath286 and @xcite @xmath287 an additional , crucial result  possible to note for e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath204 in @xcite , which seems to discuss the very same one - particle irreducible limit  is @xmath288 where both and constitute rough lower limits , possibly subject to further constraints at a more detailed analysis .    in this",
    "setting , all amplitude diagrams in maximal supergravity ( where @xmath158 only is possible as a product of several one - particle irreducible structures ) are concluded to be finite in @xmath289 by the workings of the pure spinor formalism , i.e. a formulation with both on- and off - shell maximal supersymmetry . in particular , the restrictions on the uv divergences which usually are discerned in terms of u - duality , in the pure spinor formulation show in terms of the loop regularisation @xmath290 ( variable / momenta equivalence ) and how far those momenta can be shared within the loop structures .",
    "furthermore , the limit on @xmath85 occurs not so much due to this equivalence ( although partly a product thereof ) as due to the insensitivity of the integration over the loop momenta to the @xmath290 conversion , thereby ( through the number of @xmath71s present being restricted ) limiting @xmath85 .",
    "what this corresponds to in terms of other approaches to the uv divergences in maximal supergravity is , however , difficult to tell , although it would be highly interesting to see a corresponding analysis in a different setting .",
    "the result is intriguing with respect to the uv finiteness of maximal supergravity in four dimensions .",
    "this is a scenario traditionally regarded as highly unlikely .",
    "still , the analysis in a pure spinor field theory setting indicate precisely that .",
    "admittedly , the pure spinor formalism is difficult to interpret in terms of the component fields of ordinary maximal supergravity , but despite sometimes being regarded as somewhat obscure , it encodes the same physics . in total , a confirmation of the results in a different setting would be most welcome .",
    "there is a possibility of an overall behaviour of maximal supergravity ( disregarding the specific dependence on @xmath85 ) just as in maximally supersymmetric yang ",
