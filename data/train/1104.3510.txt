    "a pseudo - noise ( pn ) code sequence , which is a deterministic but noise - like sequence generated by a linear feedback shift register , is widely used in the areas of radar and sonar signal processing , ranging and positioning , and digital communication , since it is convenient to estimate the code phase of the received signal using its peaky auto - correlation function ( acf ) . when the pn code sequence is launched to a channel and received by a remote terminal ,",
    "the cross - correlation of the received signal and a receiver replica of the pn code sequence yields a sharp peak at the lag of the propagation delay caused by the channel .",
    "this delay is related to the physical separation between the transmitter and the receiver , and thus gives important information for source localization or target detection .",
    "however , in many practical situations , the propagation medium suffers from multiple echoes with short delays due to scattering objects around the receiver .",
    "in such a case , we are frequently interested in estimating the delays of those echoes and , especially , the first arrival path , since it is the most likely to be the line - of - sight path , which contains the information of the true distance between the transmitter and the receiver .    in the multipath channel , the conventional pn code phase estimation method using the acf , which finds the peak of the correlator output , would probably give an incorrect estimate of the first arrival path delay unless the first arrival path is the most dominant path .",
    "this is because the acf for the first arrival path is buried under the sum of other overlapping acfs of echos , and thus the lag of the largest magnitude correlator output is often different from the first arrival path delay .",
    "we can work around this problem to some extent by finding multiple local extrema of the correlator output and selecting the one with the smallest lag as the estimate of the first arrival path @xcite .",
    "however , the time resolution of this method is limited to the chip duration of the pn code sequence , which is not sufficient in some narrow band applications .    in order to improve resolution of the conventional acf based code phase estimation , _ super - resolution _ techniques can be taken into account .",
    "the super - resolution techniques , such as the multiple signal classification ( music ) @xcite and the estimation of signal parameters via rotation invariance techniques ( esprit ) @xcite , were originally proposed for direction finding of multiple targets with passive sensor arrays , and first applied to the channel multipath resolution in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the super - resolution techniques were applied directly to the received signal samples without cross - correlation . in particular , in @xcite , it was shown that the super - resolution techniques can be applied to received signals sampled at a considerably lower rate than the chip rate of the pn code sequence when the signals have a finite rate of innovation ( fri ) .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite , super - resolution techniques for the correlator output signal were introduced .",
    "these techniques can significantly improve the resolution of multipath delays , compared to conventional techniques , but have some major drawbacks that render them impractical .",
    "first , since the super - resolution techniques are based on the subspace decomposition of the signal correlation matrix , the signal components contributed by different channel paths should occupy distinct dimensions of the subspace in order to be distinguishable . for this",
    ", each distinct path should be far enough apart from the others , and the attenuation of each path should be varying randomly and not be perfectly correlated with the others during an observation interval .",
    "these conditions are not satisfied when the paths are quite narrowly spaced , the channel is slowly varying , or the observation interval is not long enough . in addition",
    ", it is not so reasonable to assume that only the channel attenuations are randomly varying while the path delays are fixed . as a result ,",
    "additional techniques , such as frequency smoothing @xcite , are required at the transmitter to make the assumption valid . as a second drawback ,",
    "most super - resolution techniques are batch algorithms that compute a set of estimates from a large number of stationary observations .",
    "although the technique for fri signals @xcite can work with a very small number of observations , it has very low noise immunity and also needs a large number of observations to achieve robustness against noise .",
    "the radio ranging application , however , often requires tracking of the signal as well .",
    "that is , a new observation , which can be non - stationary , is periodically given , and a new set of estimates should be immediately computed from the new observation and the previous set of estimates in a recursive manner @xcite .",
    "thus , the super - resolution techniques are not adequate for applications where tracking is a concern .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a least - squares ( ls ) approach to resolve the short - delay multipath components with a correlator output signal .",
    "when the noise is gaussian distributed , our approach includes the maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach , which is optimal in performance .",
    "the ls and ml approaches for the channel multipath resolution were presented directly and indirectly in earlier studies @xcite , but they have not gathered much interest since the highly nonlinear nature in the parameters to be estimated renders the use of these approaches computationally intensive . in @xcite and @xcite , faster algorithms for solving a nonlinear ls problem were derived by exploiting the linear predictability of sinusoidal signals , but they are not applicable to our case . in our work , we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the ls multipath resolution problem , which we will call the _ least - squares based iterative multipath super - resolution _ ( lims ) algorithm .",
    "thanks to its iterative and recursive mode of operation , it is appropriate for multipath tracking with sequential observations of the received signal .",
    "moreover , we show that the tracking of a pn code phase using the early - late ( el ) discriminator @xcite is a special case of our algorithm . through numerical simulations",
    ", we show that our scheme asymptotically achieves the optimal performance given by the cramer - rao bound ( crb ) at high carrier - to - noise density ratio .",
    "in addition , we show that our algorithm outperforms the el discriminator based technique in the presence of severe multipaths and noise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sysmodel ] , we introduce the signal model and the ls formulation for the multipath resolution . in section [ sec : solvingls ] , we present the lims algorithm as a technique to solve the ls multipath resolution problem , and discuss the application of the lims algorithm for multipath tracking . the complexity of the lims algorithm and its relationship with the conventional el discriminator based technique are also discussed in section [ sec : solvingls ] .",
    "results of numerical simulation in various channel models and a comparison with the conventional method are given in section [ sec : simulation ] , and section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",

    "we assume that the delays @xmath17 are distinct and @xmath21 , without loss of generality .",

    "thus , to find the solution to the ls problem , a computationally expensive multidimensional search seems to be inevitable .",
    "however , there exists a useful workaround to avoid an exhaustive search : the _ gradient descent algorithm _ @xcite . the gradient descent algorithm can efficiently find the local minimum of the ls problem in an iterative manner , by stepping from the current guess of the ls solution to the direction that decreases the ls weight in ( [ eq : lsform ] ) at every iteration . in the following subsection , we propose a gradient descent algorithm for the ls multipath resolution problem , which will be denoted by the least - squares based iterative multipath super - resolution ( lims ) algorithm .      for notational simplicity ,",
