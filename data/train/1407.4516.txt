    "great strides have been made in recent years in the use of galaxy cluster surveys as probes of the halo mass function , and thereby of cosmology and fundamental physics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "cluster surveys covering the entire extragalactic sky , or a significant fraction of it , now exist at x - ray @xcite , optical / ir ( e.g.  @xcite ) and millimeter @xcite wavelengths , and a number of independent groups have published cosmological constraints in broad agreement with one another based on these data ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these cluster survey data have provided highly competitive constraints on dark energy and modifications of gravity ( e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as measurements of the late - time normalization of the matter power spectrum ( @xmath5 , defined by equation  [ eq : sigma2def ] , below ) .",
    "constraints on @xmath5 are a key complement to measurements of the amplitude of the power spectrum at high redshift from the cmb in many cosmological models of interest , particularly those where the dark energy equation of state or neutrino masses are free parameters . since cosmological data currently provide our best limits on the species - summed neutrino mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , improving constraints on @xmath5 is a priority .",
    "previous constraints on @xmath5 from clusters have been systematically limited due to fundamental uncertainties regarding the absolute calibration of cluster mass measurements ( for a discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "the most widespread observational techniques used to estimate masses , based on x - ray data or optical spectroscopy , assume that the measured thermal / kinetic energies accurately reflect the underlying gravitating mass , and are thus subject to a theoretically uncertain bias .",
    "recently , measurements of the gravitational lensing of background galaxies due to clusters have emerged as a potential avenue for providing a more accurate absolute mass calibration , since weak - lensing mass measurements are expected to be nearly unbiased when the analysis is restricted to the appropriate radial range ( e.g.  @xcite ) and systematic effects in the shear measurements and photometric redshifts can be accounted for @xcite . thanks to the availability of wide field - of - view imagers with superb image quality , such as suprimecam at the subaru telescope and megacam / megaprime at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , unbiased weak lensing measurements for large samples of clusters are now within reach .",
    "the _ weighing the giants _ project was conceived in order to provide just such an accurate and precise calibration of cluster masses for studies of cosmology , and for the closely related analysis of cluster scaling relations .",
    "the project involves 51 massive clusters that have previously been used in cosmological studies ( @xcite , hereafter , ) .",
    "details of the lensing data and their analysis appear in papers  i  iii of this series @xcite , which we collectively refer to as below .",
    "the lensing analysis has already been used to calibrate mass estimates based on x - ray observations that assume hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xcite ; applegate et  al .",
    ", in prep . ) , particularly in the context of the cosmological constraints available from gas mass fraction ( @xmath6 ) measurements in relaxed clusters @xcite . here",
    "we apply the lensing data to cosmological tests based on the cluster mass function ( also referred to as cluster counts ) , specifically by incorporating the data into the , analysis of x - ray cluster survey and follow - up data . a companion paper ( wtgv , in prep . )",
    "explores the astrophysical consequences of our mass calibration for cluster scaling relations , which are necessarily constrained simultaneously with cosmological parameters in our analysis .    given both the widespread expectation that the `` correct '' answers for cosmological parameters will be consistent with those determined from cmb data for a spatially flat , cosmological - constant model , and the potential of galaxy cluster surveys to provide high - precision cosmological constraints , minimizing the possibility of observer bias is paramount in such work .",
    "the lensing analysis employed a procedure whereby those working on it were blind in all comparisons to independent mass estimates , in particular ( but not limited to ) those from x - ray observations and from lensing results in the literature , until the lensing analysis was finalized ( see @xcite for a full discussion ) .",
    "this entire lensing analysis was completed before the cosmological analysis presented here had begun .",
    "although we did not explicitly blind cosmological parameter results in this work , the constraints reported here are simply those that follow from incorporating the lensing data into an already mature analysis pipeline ( ) , which is a simple and straightforward addition ( section  [ sec : like ] ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes our cluster data and the external cosmological probes with which we combine them , while section  [ sec : model ] outlines the analysis procedure and the models fitted to the data .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : cosmores ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] considers the importance of the lensing and x - ray follow - up data to the analysis , and the potential gains from obtaining an expanded lensing data set and combining surveys at different wavelengths .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "best - fitting parameter values reported here always correspond to modes of the marginalized posterior distributions , and uncertainties correspond to 68.3 per cent confidence maximum - likelihood intervals , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we make occasional use of a reference cosmological model , which has hubble parameter @xmath7 , mean matter density in units of the critical density @xmath8 , and cosmological constant energy density @xmath9 .",
    "we use the standard definition of cluster masses and characteristic radii in terms of a spherical overdensity , @xmath10 , with respect to the critical density at the cluster s redshift : @xmath11 .",
    "the data set employed here consists of three x - ray flux - limited samples of clusters ( i.e.  redshifts and fluxes , along with the associated selection functions ) , as well as deeper follow - up x - ray data and/or high - quality optical imaging for a subset of the detected clusters . as in , , the cluster samples used here are based on the bcs @xcite , reflex @xcite , and bright macs @xcite catalogs , themselves compiled from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; @xcite ) . in the cases of bcs and reflex ( covering redshifts @xmath12 ) , we use only clusters with 0.12.4@xmath13 luminosities @xmath14 ( as estimated for our reference cosmology ) to eliminate low - mass clusters and groups ; this cut has no impact on the bright macs sample ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we depart slightly from , by using a higher flux limit of @xmath16 in the 0.12.4@xmath13 band when selecting clusters from the bcs in order to avoid incompleteness that affects the lowest fluxes in bcs at all redshifts ( see @xcite ) . and",

    "we have also expanded the allowance for overall incompleteness / impurity for bright macs to @xmath18 per cent from the @xmath19 per cent previously assumed for macs and other surveys in , reflecting the greater challenges affecting the macs survey construction . finally , we have removed abell  2318 , rxj0250.2@xmath202129 and rxj1050.6@xmath202405 from the data set , as these appear consistent with their x - ray emission being dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) rather than the intracluster medium ( a.  edge , private communication ; other deletions from the published catalogs are listed in )",
    ". however , these changes to the data set are not significant enough to affect any of our cosmological results , as we have verified by explicitly comparing constraints using the old and new samples .",
    "the new sample contains a total of 224 clusters .",
    "x - ray luminosities and gas masses were derived from rosat and/or _ chandra _ data for 94 clusters in .",
    "we employ these measurements again in the present work , in addition to the survey data , to improve constraints on the cluster scaling relations and refine the mass information available for individual clusters ( see sections  [ sec : scalingmod ] and [ sec : followup ] ) .",
    "the new data that are central to this work are the measurements of weak gravitational lensing for 50 massive clusters , which are used to calibrate the absolute cluster mass scale .",
    "these data and their analysis are described in .",
    "specifically , we use the shear profiles derived from the simpler `` color - cut '' method of that work , which are available for the entire data set , rather than those from the `` @xmath21 '' method , which are available for just over half of the sample .",
    "masses have been used to characterize the bias and scatter of the color - cut method @xcite , and this information is fed into the analysis presented here ( specifically it factors into the width of the lensing - to - true mass normalization ; see section  [ sec : scalingmod ] ) .",
    "the larger number of clusters for which we can do a color - cut analysis makes this cross - calibration approach preferable to relying exclusively on @xmath21 clusters .",
    "] of the 50 clusters , 27 belong to the flux - limited sample identified above , and are straightforward to incorporate into the likelihood function for cosmology and scaling relations described in and reviewed in section  [ sec : like ] .",
    "the remaining 23 can not be used to constrain the x - ray luminosity  mass relation because , even though they are x - ray selected , we do not have a robustly quantified selection function for them with which to account for selection biases .",
    "however , they can still be used to calibrate the relation linking gas and total mass , to the extent that the correlation of intrinsic scatters in luminosity and gas mass at fixed total mass is small ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we have verified empirically that including these additional lensing data in this way ( see section  [ sec : like ] ) does not bias our cosmological results .",
    "in addition to the measurements of redshift , x - ray luminosity , gas mass and total mass ( integrated over radii @xmath22 ) , we take advantage of the cosmological information available from x - ray measurements of the gas mass fraction , @xmath23 , at @xmath24 for relaxed clusters",

    "are minimized and where x - ray spectroscopy permits precise total mass estimates .",
    "these data provide additional constraints on dark energy parameters and , when combined with external priors on the cosmic mean baryon density ( @xmath30 ) , produce tight constraints on @xmath31 .",
    "these @xmath250.81.2@xmath26 data do not constrain @xmath5 , although their constraint on @xmath32 is useful for breaking the degeneracy between the two parameters in cluster counts data .",
    "our baseline cluster analysis uses all the data described above , the rass cluster catalogs , mass proxies from x - ray follow - up data , lensing data and @xmath6 measurements ( but see section  [ sec : s8 ] ) , and also incorporates gaussian priors on the hubble parameter ( @xmath33 ; @xcite ) and the cosmic baryon density ( @xmath34 ; @xcite ) .",

    "note that sections  [ sec : growthindex ] and [ sec : nongauss ] introduce modifications to the evolution of the power spectrum and the mass function in order to investigate departures from general relativity ( gr ) and non - gaussianities in the primordial perturbation field .",
    "these are outlined in the respective sections .",
    "connecting the predicted mass function to a flux - limited survey requires a scaling relation  a stochastic function consisting of a mean relation and a model for intrinsic scatter  linking mass and x - ray luminosity .",
    "additional observables that have a smaller intrinsic scatter at fixed mass ( i.e.  better mass proxies , namely gas mass and temperature in the case of x - ray follow - up observations ) can improve cosmological constraints by refining the information available for individual clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also section  [ sec : followup ] ) .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to define joint scaling relations , describing the trends and joint scatter of several observables as a function of mass , as we do below . due to the ubiquity of selection biases in cosmological samples and the steepness of the mass function , accurate constraints on scaling relations ( and cosmology )",
    "can only be obtained from a simultaneous cosmology+scaling relation analysis that properly accounts for the influence of the mass function and the survey selection function on the observed data ( see section  [ sec : like ] , , and @xcite ) .",
    "our model for the cluster scaling relations is that of , , expanded to include the new weak lensing observations .",
    "we describe the scaling of each observable cluster property with mass as a power law , and the joint intrinsic scatter as a multi - dimensional log - normal distribution . for this purpose , we define the logarithmic total mass within @xmath70 as @xmath71 with @xmath72 . the corresponding definitions for observables  luminosity ( 0.12.4kev band ) , center - excised temperature , gas mass and lensing mass  are @xmath73 the quantities in equation  [ eq : mltdefs ] represent intrinsic properties of a given cluster , as distinct from measured values ( to which they are related by a model for measurement scatter ) ; along with @xmath74 , they are free parameters of the model",

    "we assume a slope of unity and place priors on the normalization and intrinsic scatter .",
    "specifically , we adopt a gaussian prior on the normalization , @xmath87 , encoding the expected bias ( and its uncertainty ) of weak lensing masses due to triaxiality , line - of - sight structure , the assumption of a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) mass profile , systematic biases affecting shear measurements , photometric redshift errors , and the statistical uncertainty accrued in cross - calibrating @xmath21 ( 5-filter ) and color - cut ( 3-filter ) lensing data .",
    "( full details can be found in @xcite . )",
    "we constrain the scatter between @xmath76 and @xmath74 with a wide gaussian prior , @xmath88 per cent , where the central value is motivated by the simulations of @xcite . , and find that this has a negligible effect on our cosmological constraints .",
    "this is due to the small range in mass covered by our lensing data , and the fact that , when x - ray mass proxy information is also included in the analysis , the data are able to directly constrain the intrinsic scatter at the pivot mass of the lensing sample ( appendix  [ sec : scaling ] ) .",
    "note that the width of our prior on the intrinsic scatter , significantly greater than the uncertainties reported by @xcite , partly reflects differences between their analysis and ours , such as our use of a fixed concentration parameter ( section  [ sec : like ] ) . ]",
    "the @xmath75@xmath74 relation deserves some additional consideration , since the value and evolution of its normalization , @xmath89 , carry additional cosmological information ( @xcite ; ) . in principle",
    ", this information could be used in tandem with the more precise @xmath250.81.2@xmath90 measurements of , given a suitable model for their covariance . in practice",
    ", the low precision of our mass constraints at @xmath70 for individual clusters ( due to the scatter in @xmath91 ) significantly limits the information available from the @xmath75@xmath74 relation .",
    "in addition , the measurement correlation between the two @xmath6 values is negligible , since the total masses are estimated independently from different data ( lensing vs.  x - ray ) and the gas mass measured in the 0.81.2@xmath29 shell is a small fraction of that integrated within @xmath70 .",
    "we therefore simplify the analysis by keeping the model for @xmath250.81.2@xmath90 , used for the data , independent of the parameters of the @xmath75@xmath74 relation .",
    "in addition to allowing the normalization , mass dependence and intrinsic scatter of the @xmath75@xmath74 relation to vary , we marginalize over a @xmath19 per cent uniform prior on the evolution of the normalization , of the form @xmath92 .",
    "this form , and the prior itself , are identical to those used to describe the evolution in @xmath250.81.2@xmath90 in , but @xmath93 is varied independently of the corresponding parameter at @xmath29 .",
    "we constrain the intrinsic scatter in @xmath94 with a uniform prior spanning 0.00.10 , where 0.10 corresponds to the high end of the confidence interval for the fractional intrinsic scatter of @xmath28 , measured from the data ( mantz et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the complete likelihood of the x - ray and lensing data set takes the same form as in , @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the expected number of cluster detections in the survey data for a given set of model parameters , accounting for the selection function .",
    "the product runs over the @xmath97 detected clusters , and accounts for their redshifts , survey fluxes and any follow - up measurements .",

    "the claimed precision on the mass calibration from this procedure is @xmath146 per cent with no additional systematic uncertainty accounted for ; the reported @xmath5 constraints are instead limited by uncertainty in the slope and scatter of the mass  temperature relation .",
    "the analysis of @xcite employs a combination of low - redshift rass clusters and clusters at @xmath147 from the 400 square degree rosat catalog @xcite .",
    "their mass calibration was based on hydrostatic estimates from _ chandra _ data , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath148 per cent estimated by comparing to the lensing data available at the time @xcite , assuming a fixed cosmology .",

    "their mass calibration is from a stacked lensing analysis of the sdss data , with a 6 per cent systematic allowance assigned based on the level of agreement between two analyses of the lensing data ( systematics common to both analyses are not accounted for ) . due to the steepness of the mass function and the nature of stacked analysis ,",
    "this adopted calibration uncertainty applies most directly to the low - richness end of the cluster sample .",
    "the @xmath5 constraints from this analysis are most dependent on the masses of high - richness clusters , where the statistical uncertainty is greater . the error budget for @xmath5 is predominantly determined by this statistical component ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the sz cluster constraints shown include those from the spt , act and _ planck _ cluster surveys .",
    "the spt analysis of @xcite ultimately uses the same x - ray mass calibration as that of @xcite , and indeed the agreement between the two results is very close ; the spt constraints are slightly less tight due to an allowance for evolution in the mass calibration between the low - redshift calibration sample of @xcite and the typical redshifts of spt clusters .",
    "the act results shown in figure  [ fig : oms8comp ] use a mass calibration derived from galaxy velocity dispersion measurements , with an adopted systematic uncertainty of 15 per cent in mass @xcite . in this case , the particularly large uncertainties in @xmath5 are most likely dominated by the small size of the data set used to constrain the sz scaling relation ( 7 clusters with dynamical masses ) rather than the 15 per cent prior on the mass calibration itself .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "cluster results are marginalized over a uniform prior of @xmath149 per cent in the mass calibration ( for comparison to the gaussian priors used elsewhere , this has a standard deviation of @xmath150 per cent ) . for their main analysis , which does not account for this systematic uncertainty , the error bar is approximately half as large .",
    "the mass calibration in this case is tied to hydrostatic estimates based on xmm-_newton _ x - ray data .",
    "since the systematic uncertainties associated with the cluster mass scale have been only rough estimates in previous works , the right panel of figure  [ fig : oms8comp ] is in some sense more illustrative than informative .",
    "we would argue that earlier analyses based on x - ray masses for relaxed clusters should have included systematic uncertainties in their mass calibrations no smaller than the @xmath141 per cent allowance included in , and thus have comparable uncertainty in @xmath5 , and those that used hydrostatic masses for even unrelaxed clusters should include even larger uncertainties .",
    "note that this does not necessarily imply better agreement among the cluster results themselves , given the considerable overlap in the clusters used for these hydrostatic mass calibrations ( generally x - ray bright rosat clusters at redshifts @xmath151 ) .",
    "this only underscores the utility of mass estimates that are independent of x - ray detector calibrations and cluster dynamical state .",
    "apart from this work , the other major result based on a weak lensing calibration , and the only other result ( excepting @xcite ) not ultimately based on x - ray hydrostatic mass estimates , is that of @xcite . while their adopted 6 per cent uncertainty in the mass calibration",
    "is arguably likely to be underestimated , it is interesting that their @xmath5 measurement is the closest to ours of all the independent cluster results considered here .",
    "we note that our value of @xmath5 is marginally larger than some recent results from ground- and space - based cosmic shear and weak lensing tomography .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath152 ( again at fixed @xmath8 ) from a 2-dimensional cosmic shear analysis of cfhtlens data .",
    ", from a tomographic analysis of the cfhtlens data . ] the tomographic lensing analysis of hst cosmos data by @xcite yields a value of @xmath153 , which is nominally lower than our constraints , but consistent within the uncertainties .      for a given amplitude of the matter power spectrum at the surface of last scattering ,",
    "the predicted amplitude at low redshifts depends on the species - summed mass of neutrinos , @xmath40 , with larger values of @xmath40 corresponding to smaller values of @xmath5 ( for a review , see @xcite ) . exploiting this degeneracy , constraints on @xmath5 from clusters",
    "can be used in conjunction with cmb data ( and other cosmological probes ) to place limits on @xmath40 that are considerably stronger than current laboratory experiments ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however",
    ", accurate constraints can only be obtained to the extent that the cluster and cmb measurements of the power spectrum amplitude are unbiased . over the years",
    ", the combination of different data sets has led to gradually tightening upper limits on @xmath40 , including occasional claims of a preference for @xmath154 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    .",
    "posterior modes and 95.4 per cent confidence upper limits on @xmath40 ( in ev ) from the combination of cluster , cmb , supernova and bao data .",

    "in our study of the growth index of cosmic structure ( section  [ sec : growthindex ] ) , as in our previous analyses , we obtain the contribution of the isw effect to the anisotropy power spectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations through an integral over time of the variation of the gravitational potential with respect to conformal time , @xmath159 @xcite . for the latter ,",
