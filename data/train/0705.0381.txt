    "colloidal fluids play a central role both in technology and in the study of condensed matter . regarding the latter , suspensions of colloids are interesting model systems because they can behave collectively in ways that are similar to atomic and molecular liquids while simultaneously being both large and slow enough to allow experimental measurements of their real - space structure and dynamics .",
    "despite the similarities between the behaviors of colloids , atoms , and molecules , there also are important , qualitative differences.@xcite for example , the effective interparticle attractions between colloids can be `` tuned '' to be short - ranged relative to the particle diameter @xmath0 , unlike the dispersion attractions in atomic and molecular systems that decay more gradually with interparticle separation @xmath1 , i.e. , as @xmath2 .",
    "short - ranged attractive ( sra ) interactions have nontrivial implications for the static structural , equilibrium thermodynamic , and dynamic behaviors of colloidal suspensions . for instance ,",
    "whereas cooling a simple atomic liquid generally slows down its dynamic processes , several recent studies have demonstrated that reducing the temperature ( or increasing the attractive interactions ) of an sra fluid can have a non - monotonic effect on its mobility .",
    "in fact , concentrated sra fluids can vitrify not only upon cooling , forming an `` attractive '' glass or gel , but also upon heating , forming a `` repulsive '' or hard - sphere ( hs ) glass.@xcite since the structural and mechanical properties of these glassy states can be quite different , there is a broad interest in understanding the properties of the precursor supercooled fluids from which they are formed .    in this article",
    ", we explore whether the unusual effect that temperature has on the dynamics of sra fluids reflects a more general connection between the static structure and the dynamics of condensed phases . in doing so",
    ", we find it instructive to view the behavior of sra fluids in the context of another well - studied system with anomalous dynamical trends , liquid water .",
    "cold water behaves differently than simple fluids in that its mobility _ increases _ upon isothermal compression over a broad range of conditions .",
    "interestingly , the state points where water shows this behavior is a subset of a larger region on its phase diagram where its local structural order anomalously _ decreases _ upon compression.@xcite in other words , there is a `` cascade of anomalies''@xcite where the pressure - induced disordering of liquid water emerges at a lower density , and ultimately disappears at a higher density , when compared to the pressure - induced increase in its mobility . it has been recently argued@xcite that this behavior follows from the fact that water approximately obeys a scaling relationship between its self - diffusivity and the structural order parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the contribution to the fluid s excess entropy due to its static oxygen - oxygen pair correlations , and @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant",
    ", we use molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate the relationships between static structural order ( @xmath3 ) , self - diffusivity ( @xmath6 ) , and viscosity ( @xmath7 ) for both a hs fluid and an sra fluid . one of our main aims is to understand whether the latter shows a cascade of anomalies similar to that of liquid water .",
    "specifically , we are interested in whether the region on the phase diagram of an sra fluid where it becomes more mobile ( higher @xmath6 , lower @xmath7 ) upon cooling is a subset of a larger set of conditions where the fluid becomes more ordered ( higher @xmath3 ) upon heating . a second , and",

    "we choose @xmath16 for the sw - sra fluid , a range similar to that of other sw - sra fluids known to exhibit anomalous dynamical behavior@xcite . in order to avoid crystallization in our study , and thus allow study of the supercooled fluid states",

    "molecular dynamics simulations were performed using an event - driven algorithm @xcite in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "for all runs , @xmath25 particles were simulated in a cubic simulation cell of volume @xmath26 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "particle packing fractions @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 were investigated for both model systems , and temperatures @xmath29 in the range @xmath30 were examined for the sw - sra fluid . for each thermodynamic state point ,",

    "although it is not yet possible to equilibrate molecular dynamics simulations very close to the repulsive or attractive glass transitions in the sw - sra fluid , the data shown in fig .  [ fig : sw_scaled_trans_vs_s2](a ) and ( b ) are suggestive of what may happen to the structural order of the fluid in those limits . as discussed earlier , the high temperature behaviors of the sw - sra transport coefficients , when plotted versus @xmath33 , approximately follow the trends of the hs fluid .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suspect that the structural order parameter of the high temperature ( repulsive ) glass @xmath102 will be close to that of the hs glass [ fig .",
    "[ fig : s2-glass - schematic](a ) ] . at low temperatures ,",
    "the transport coefficients of the sw - sra fluid as a function of @xmath33 also appear as if they may asymptote to a different , lower , limiting value [ fig .",
    "[ fig : s2-glass - schematic](a ) ] , i.e. , a value of the structural order parameter @xmath103 characteristic of the attractive glass .",
    "the resulting picture is that the repulsive and attractive glass lines closely follow two `` iso-@xmath4 '' curves , with a sharp transition between the two in a narrow temperature range , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2-glass - schematic](b ) ) .",
    "since @xmath4 can be readily obtained from static pair correlations , this is a speculation that could be tested via experiments of sra colloidal fluids .",
    "@xcite it would also be interesting to explore in future studies the extent to which liquid - state ( e.g. , mode - coupling ) theories for sra fluids are able to reproduce the empirical connection between @xmath4 and dynamics found in our simulations and to test the predictions that they make about how the structural order varies along the ideal repulsive and attractive glass lines .",
    "we have presented new molecular simulation data for viscosity , self - diffusivity , and the local structural ordering of both a hard - sphere fluid and a square - well fluid with short - range attractions ( relative to the particle diameter ) .",
    "we found that the latter system has a region of mobility anomalies in the temperature - packing fraction plane , where its self - diffusivity increases upon isochoric cooling .",
    "this region is entirely enclosed within a wider set of state points where the fluid s pair correlations strengthen upon isochoric heating .",
    "this type of `` cascade of anomalies '' is very similar to that found in recent simulations of liquid water , and it follows from a broader connection between static structure and dynamics in condensed phase systems .    both the hard - sphere and square - well fluids show that the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation upon supercooling occurs for conditions where viscosity and self - diffusivity develop different couplings to the degree of pairwise structural ordering of the liquid .",
    "we discussed how these couplings reflect dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "finally , we provided an experimentally testable hypothesis about how repulsive and attractive glasses may be generally characterized by two distinct levels of short - range structural order . in future work , we will investigate whether there are similar connections between non - equilibrium dynamics ( e.g. shear - dependent viscosity ) and structural order in these systems .",
