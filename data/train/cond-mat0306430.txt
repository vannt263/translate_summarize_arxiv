    "a family of ring - form metal - organic complexes of iron @xcite has attracted an appreciable interest due to their natural beauty and high symmetry , favourable for building theoretical models .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data of magnetic susceptibility measurements , torque magnetometry and inelastic neutron scattering , yielding a satisfactory mapping onto the spin hamiltonian @xmath4 with @xmath5 18  20 k ( depending on sample and method ) for \\{li@xmath6fe@xmath7[n(ch@xmath8ch@xmath8o)@xmath9@xmath7}cl , the system of our present study .",
    "the ground state was found to be antiferromagnetic ; the charge state of iron in such materials is routinely referred to as fe(iii ) , that implies individual spins @xmath1=5/2 in the above equation . while there is recently a consensus reached in interpreting magnetic bulk measurements in terms of the heisenberg spin model @xcite ,",
    "the microscopic information on the electronic subsystem is much less known .",
    "we undertook a number of x - ray spectroscopy measurements , of which we report now the photoelectron valence band spectrum and the fe @xmath10 x - ray emission spectrum .",
    "these results are compared with , and discussed on the basis of , first - principles electronic structure calculations carried out in the framework of the density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this gives an additional insight in the site - resolved magnetization , chemical bonding , and energetics of magnetic transitions in `` ferric wheels '' .",
    "the xps measurements were performed using a phi model 5600ci multitechnique system and employing monochromatized al  @xmath11 radiation .",
    "the pressure in the vacuum chamber during the measurements was below 5@xmath1210@xmath13  mbar ; the charge neutrality on the surface was achieved by a low energy electron flood gun . the energy resolution",
    "as determined at the fermi level of a gold foil was 0.30.4  ev .",
    "powder samples of \\{li@xmath6fe@xmath7[n(ch@xmath8ch@xmath8o)@xmath9@xmath7}cl , obtained by drying the crystals in vacuum and thus removing the chcl@xmath14 molecules , were measured in a small gold crucible .",
    "the structure of the hexagonal unit cells is preserved upon drying , but the lattice parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are reduced by about 30% @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the xps spectra was performed assuming two non  equivalent positions of c in the molecule and 0.8  ev difference between the corresponding c@xmath17 peaks , as suggested by the similar surrounded c atoms in ptmg and pei polymers ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with this procedure",
    "the maximum of the c@xmath17 xps spectrum was found at 286  ev .",
    "the xes measurements were performed at beamline 8.0.1 at the advanced light source of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "the spectra were taken employing the university of tennessee at knoxville soft x - ray fluorescence endstation @xcite . the fe  @xmath18 emission",
    "was measured with incident photon energies ranging between 702.2 and 738.7  ev and an energy resolution of about 0.8  ev .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using a pure fe sample as reference . in this report",
    "only the spectrum corresponding to the fe  @xmath10 emission is listed .",
    "the calculations of electronic structure from first - principles have been done within the dft , using the siesta method @xcite .",
    "the features of this method are an efficient construction of localized numerical atom - centered basis functions and the use of norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "the independence on crystal symmetry makes the method particularly useful for structure optimizations and molecular dynamics . in the present case , however , because the calculations on such large system are quite time - consuming , we performed them so far only for nominal ( fixed ) structures .",
    "`` ferric wheels '' crystallize along with some amount of solvent molecules ; due to the fact that intermolecular distances are large , we included in the present simulation only a single molecule of 140 atoms  without solvent , but including a chlorine atom ( actually present in molecular crystal ) as a counter - ion to lithium , for correct charge compensation .",
    "the molecule was treated in a box with dimensions 22@xmath1922@xmath1918  , on which the real - space grid of 180@xmath19180@xmath19150 divisions ( corresponding to the cutoff energy of 180 ry ) was imposed for solving the poisson equation by the fast fourier transform .",
    "the basis set included double-@xmath20 functions with polarization orbitals on o and fe and double-@xmath20 functions on all other atoms ( according to the specifications used by the tight - binding community ; see for details ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke and ernzerhof @xcite .",
    "although non - collinear magnetization density can be treated by siesta , for a large system as the present one this slows down calculations considerably . as the ground state of our `` ferric wheel ''",
    "is believed to be antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , it is simulated as an alternating sequence of up and down spin moments on the ring .",
    "other spin arrangements  fully ferromagnetic ( fm ) , or with one or two spins inverted  have also been tried , and found stable .",
    "the energy relations between these solutions are discussed in the next section .",
    "the photoelectron spectrum of the valence band reveals separated features which can be easily attributed to o , n and c @xmath21 states , and a roughly structureless peak around the binding energy of @xmath225 ev , that can be tentatively attributed to fe@xmath23 states , hybridizing with the o@xmath24 band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "a comparison with electronic structure results confirms this assignment .",
    "the fe @xmath10 x - ray emission spectrum probes occupied fe@xmath25 states ; it reveals an overall shape in good agreement with calculated partial density of fe@xmath25 states .",
    "the latter turns out to be very similar irrespective of the actual mutual orientation of spins , fm or antiferromagnetic afm , and exhibits in all cases a crystal - field splitting ( of about 4 ev ) into @xmath26-like and @xmath27-like states in the majority - spin channel .",
    "the calculated partial dos at the fe site , along with some its neighbours , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] .",
    "these results reveal a complicated pattern of hybridization between fe , o and n atoms , a detailed discussion of which will be given elsewhere .",
    "one notes a pronounced fe@xmath23o@xmath24 chemical bonding , which gives rise to magnetic polarization in oxygen @xmath24 shells",
    ". moreover , more distant carbon and nitrogen atoms , whose @xmath24 states are moreover quite separated in energy from the fe@xmath23 , exhibit a small but not vanishing polarization .    it is noteworthy that the @xmath23-shell of fe , although strongly polarized , does not yet develop a spin configuration @xmath1=5/2 , contrary to what is routinely assumed in the literature . instead",
    ", the local magnetic moment is close to 4 @xmath28 , in relative independence of its precise definition ( choice of functions for the population analysis , etc . ) .",
    "while the majority - spin states are fully occupied , the minority - spin band still contains about one electron , because of the above mentioned fe@xmath23o@xmath24 hybridization .",
    "the presence of one minority - spin electron on the fe site implies the fe@xmath29 configuration and not fe@xmath30 as would seem compatible with @xmath1=5/2 .",
    "the peculiarity of the situation is that an extra majority - spin electron is delocalized over the organic fragment hosting the fe atom .",
    "this recovers spin @xmath1=5/2 per fe atom in the molecule , consistently with macroscopic measurements .",
    "the partial dos shown in fig .  [ fig : pdos ] corresponds to some artificial broadening of discrete energy levels of the molecule , for better visibility .",
    "such broadening is legitimate , as long as it remains small enough not to smear out the band gap and to maintain a clear separation between groups of energy levels split in the ligand field . actually , an artificial broadening is a useful tool for speeding up the convergence of calculation , that ( due to the presence of many nearly degenerate levels near the fermi energy ) is otherwise quite instable even at mixing parameters of about 10@xmath31 , demanding for many thousands of iterations .",
    "the problem is that such smearing does affect calculated total energies quite dramatically , to the point that a reliable comparison of spin - flip energetics , used to estimate exchange interactions of the order of tens of k , becomes impossible . a very useful technique in this relation is the fixed spin moment ( fsm ) scheme @xcite . in our case , imposing an ( integer ) spin moment per molecule fixes the number of electrons in both spin channels and thus removes the major reason of instability in the course of calculations . as a consequence",
    ", the broadening parameter can be safely reduced to the values which permit a reliable extrapolation to zero level width .",
    "the results conveniently converge for fsm values of 30 @xmath0 ( fm case ) , 20 and 10 @xmath0 ( one and two spins inverted , correspondingly ) ; 0 ( alternate - spin afm case ) .",
    "the calculated total energy values are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ] .    typically , comparison of total energies obtained in the fsm scheme needs to take into account the `` zeeman term '' due to the fermi energies  now possibly different in two spin channels  moving apart , as if in a fictitiously imposed magnetic field . in our case , however , no additional terms to the total energy must be included , because  as is seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ]  there is a common energy gap in both spin channels throughout the whole range of fsm values we studied . a linear change of the total energy",
    "while inverting one and then two spins from the fm configuration implies the validity of the heisenberg model , as we seemingly deal with `` rigid '' magnetic moments .",
    "an additional argumentation comes from the fact that the magnitudes of local magnetic moments always remain close ( within several per cent ) to 4 @xmath0 , and the partial dos on fe sites remains largely unaffected by the actual magnetic ordering . keeping this in mind , and assuming heisenberg - model spin hamiltonian as in section  [ sec : intro ] with the @xmath1 value of 5/2 ( i.e. , for the total spin which gets inverted ) , we arrive at the estimate for @xmath32 of around 80 k ( over both 30@xmath3320 and 20@xmath3310 @xmath0 flips ) .",
    "this is qualitatively correct ( i.e. indicates preferentially afm coupling ) and even of correct order of magnitude .",
    "however , two observations can be done .",
    "first , the `` true '' afm configuration ( with half of magnetic moments inverted on the ring ) does not follow the linear trend ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fsm ] ) and lies actually higher in energy than the configuration with two spins inverted .",
    "the origin of this is not yet clear to us at the moment .",
    "from one side , the zero - fsm configuration is  technically  the most difficult to converge , so",
    "some numerical instability can still play a role . from the other side , the true afm ground - state configuration is apparently not collinear , the fact which does not follow from the simplest ( nearest - neighbours ) version of the heisenberg model and probably manifests its shortcomings .",
    "the second observation concerns the magnitude of exchange parameter @xmath2 and the fact that it is probably overestimated by a factor of @xmath224 in our calculation .",
    "the origin of this lies most probably in on - site correlations , which , if treated accurately beyond the standard schemes of the dft , would primarily affect localized fe@xmath23 states , shifting the bulk of occupied states downwards in energy , the bulk of unoccupied states upwards , expanding the energy gap , and ",
    "whatever scheme to use for estimating exchange parameters  substantially reducing their magnitude .",
    "this has been recently shown for another molecular magnet ( mn@xmath34 ) by boukhvalov _",
    "formalism @xcite is a possible scheme of choice for such a simulation .",
    "it may help to adjust the situation in a physically reasonable way , but does not necessarily help to make quantitative",
    "_ predictions_. ]    summarizing our analysis of the electronic structure of a li - based `` ferric wheel '' , the combined use of spectroscopy techniques and first - principles calculations leads to the following conclusions : this system develops strong local magnetic moments on fe sites , but their magnitude is close to 4 @xmath0 and not 5 @xmath0 as is often assumed .",
    "the value of 5 @xmath0 can still be attributed to a fe atom _ in a molecule _",
    ", with considerable part of this magnetization distributed over ( mostly ) oxygen and other atoms .",
    "correspondingly , iron atoms are not ionized to + 3 , but instead acquire a configuration close to fe@xmath29 , with a substantial covalent part in the fe  o bonding . with respect to its magnetic interactions",
    ", this system can be mapped reasonably well onto the heisenberg model ; hence we deal with _ rigid _ magnetic moments which are nevertheless _ delocalized _  an interesting counter - example to a common belief that the heisenberg model primarily applies to localized spins .",
