    "careful studies for dry granular materials suggest that the arrest of granular flow is universal in the sense that this non - equilibrium transition admits a continuum description .",
    "this points to the existence of an equation of state for dry granular matter  @xcite .",
    "similarly , various features of phase transition in vertically agitated wet granular materials can faithfully be described in terms of thermodynamic concepts  @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of papers @xcite also addressed phase transitions in sheared wet granular matter .",
    "in particular , the arrest of wet granular flows driven by external forces with a cosine profile was attributed to a crossover of the power injected into the flow by the external field and the power dissipated in the rupturing of capillary bridges @xcite .",
    "this provided a quantitative description of the arrest of shear flows of bidisperse disks @xcite and dumbbells @xcite with a fixed density , and of three - dimensional gravity - confined flow of monodisperse grains @xcite .",
    "the studies established that the minimal external forcing required to maintain flow can be calculated along the same line for transitions in fixed - density and fixed - pressure settings .",
    "also , for both wet disks and dumbbells , a large hysteresis was identified in which the fluid - to - solid arrest stress , @xmath3 , or the dynamic yield stress , has been found to be smaller than the solid - to - fluid yield stress , or the static yield stress .",
    "this is in accord with the conventional wisdom where the stress at yield point is conceived to be larger than the minimum ( plastic ) stress which is required to maintain the flow .",
    "moreover , in a recent study , the difference of the static and dynamic yield stress is pinned down to the nonmonotonicity of the flow curves .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the nonmonotonicity of the flow curves indicates a shear banding instability  @xcite .    here",
    ", we augment these studies by addressing the arrest stress in systems with a prescribed global shear rate , @xmath4 . rather than settings with complex flow profiles we consider for our present study uniform shear flows in a lees - edwards  @xcite periodic boundary flow geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setting ] ) .",
    "this point of view is dual to the study of force - controlled systems where we prescribe a force amplitude and measure the minimal force required to sustain flow . in the present study",
    "we will address the arrest stress , _ i.e. , _  the smallest value of the stress observed when decreasing the shear shear rate in spatially uniform granular flows . by definition of the stress tensor , the product of this arrest stress and the system size amounts to the minimal force that creeping flows with uniform shear profile exert on the borders of a shear cell .",
    "this correspondence provides a quantitative prediction of the arrest stress where the only adjustable parameters have been measured in the force - controlled setting @xcite .",
    "the agreement provides further support for the modeling of the flow threshold based on energy dissipation arguments that were established in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : setting ] ]    the present study is based on extensive simulations of a two dimensional wet granular material whose critical force for the arrest of flow has fully been characterized in ref .  @xcite .",

    "we determine the dependence of the arrest stress , @xmath3 , on the packing density , @xmath1 , and the capillary energy , @xmath2 .",
    "the data are obtained by careful extrapolation of a sequence of numerical measurements of the stress for larger shear rates to vanishing @xmath5 , where we take care to base this extrapolation only on systems with uniform shear profiles .",
    "requiring consistency with the setting where the flow is driven by an external force @xcite , provides a parameter - free prediction of @xmath3 that is in excellent quantitative agreement with the numerical results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : prediction ] we revisit the theory for the arrest of flow @xcite , and adapt it to describe the arrest stress of a uniformly sheared system .",

    "[ sec : results ] comprises the results on the shear - rate dependence of the stress , and its extrapolation to zero shear rate .",
    "we will demonstrate that for intermediate packing densities , @xmath1 , the parameter dependence of the arrest stress is faithfully described by the parameter free prediction derived in sect .",
    "[ sec : prediction ] , and trace down the additional physical processes causing the differences for small and large @xmath1 .",
    "our main results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider uniform shear in a two - dimensional system in a domain of size @xmath13 . by definition ,",
    "the shear stress , @xmath14 , corresponds to a force @xmath15 required to act at the boundaries of the system in order to maintain the uniform flow .",
    "following @xcite we identify the critical force persisting at very small shear rates based on a power balance of the work injected into , and dissipated in the system .",
    "energy is dissipated by breaking capillary bridges spanning the stress network .",
    "hence , the dissipated power takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy needed to rupture a capillary bridge , and @xmath0 the average number of bridges ruptures when two disks pass in the shear flow .",
    "to arrive at the flow configuration ( i ) the spatial density of disks , @xmath18 , per unit length is the ratio of the total number of disks , @xmath19 , and the width , @xmath20 , of the system , and ( ii ) the shear rate is constant , @xmath21const .",
    "on the other hand , for a system with uniform density and shear the total injected power is the product of the off - diagonal element of the stress tensor , @xmath14 , the shear rate , @xmath5 , and the system area , @xmath22 , @xmath23    flow ceases when the forcing injects too little energy to balance dissipation .",
    "the threshold value , @xmath3 , is obtained by balancing @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the areal density of disks .    in this expression",
    "the number @xmath0 depends on the packing fraction , @xmath1 , and on the capillary energy , @xmath17 , because collective motion is needed when disks pass each other in a dense system  as initially discussed for a system where flow is driven by an external cosinus - shaped force field @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on systematic data collapses and heuristic scaling arguments , we have derived an explicit analytical formula for the dependence of the average bridge number , @xmath0 , on the packing fraction , @xmath1 , and the capillary energy , @xmath2 . as an alternative equation , in fig .",

    "using these normalized quantities it is straightforward to normalize all physical quantities derived from mass , length and time , such as the local averages of disk velocities , components of the stress tensor , and the shear rate .      for each parameter set we run @xmath68 simulations over a fixed total strain of @xmath69 .",
    "the choice to fix the total strain , rather than fixing the total simulation time , ensures that in the limit of very small flow rates we still sample a representative set of statistically uncorrelated disk configurations .",
    "we start to measure the physical quantities at the strain @xmath70 and take @xmath71 shots over the rest of the simulations until @xmath72 .",

    "@xcite , the shear thinning exponent is a material dependent parameter for which no universality has been found .",
    "therefore , eq .  [ eq : herschel ] would be a natural choice to be considered as a template function for experimental data fitting .",
    "however , we found out that when the shear thinning exponent , @xmath87 , is variable , for large capillary energies , @xmath88 , the fitting algorithm frequently takes very small exponents in the order of @xmath37 .",
    "this very small exponent gives rise to a flow profile which is very steep near the origin . as a result of the sharp fall near the origin ,",
    "it becomes more likely that the fitting algorithm grasps a negative offset .",
    "the negative offset corresponds to a negative arrest ( yield ) stress , @xmath3 , which is non - physical . in order to prevent this fitting failure ,",
