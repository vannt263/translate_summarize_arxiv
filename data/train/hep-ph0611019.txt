    "it is clear now that the quark sea in nucleon has a nontrivial contribution .",
    "the emc effects have indicated that only a small amount of nucleon spin is carried by quark , and that the strange sea quark in the proton may have a negative contribution to the nucleon spin@xcite .",
    "recently , both deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan experiments show that there exists flavor asymmetry of light quarks in the nucleon sea@xcite .",
    "moreover , the parity - violating electron - nucleon experiments indicate that the strangeness electric form factor @xmath6 is negative while the strangeness magnetic form factor @xmath7 is positive@xcite .",
    "these issues mean that the constituent valence quark model(cvqm ) can not explain the complicated quark structure of baryons completely .    beyond the cvqm , more interesting models about the substructure of baryons have been proposed .",
    "such as quark - gluon hybrid model , diquark - quark model @xcite , various meson cloud model@xcite , and so on . to investigate the possible strange component in nucleon , there have many theoretical approaches , such as the lattice qcd calculation @xcite , chiral perturbation and dispersion relation@xcite , gdp sum rule@xcite , @xmath8 meson cloud model@xcite , and various quark models@xcite correlating the octet baryon magnetic moments by assuming su(3 ) flavor symmetry@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical analyses and calculations have given a negative sign for magnetic form factor of proton .",
    "ref.@xcite has obtained a positive result , however , the positive contribution is believed being automatically included by a relativistic calculation@xcite .",

    ", there is a unique @xmath10 configuration which can give the right signs of the strange magnetic , electric and axial form factors@xcite . in this configuration ,",
    "the @xmath11 is in the ground state and the @xmath12 subsystem in the @xmath13-state .",
    "this configuration has the lowest energy of all configurations under the assumption that the hyperfine interaction between the quarks is spin dependent@xcite .",
    "this configuration may also give an explanation to the excess of @xmath14 over @xmath15@xcite .",
    "besides , the five - quark components of this configuration in the @xmath16 give a significant contribution to @xmath17 decay @xcite .",

    ", we obtain a general formula of the magnetic moments of octet baryons by using the cqcm . in sec.iii",
    "we give our numerical results by fitting to experimental values of octet baryon magnetic moments .",
    "the results show that the theoretical values of those magnetic moments from the cqcm is better than those from the cvqm , and that the strange component in the nucleon is small or zero . in sec.iv",
    ", we have compared our results with the already existed experiments and other theoretical analyses .",

    "the positive parity demands that the four - quark subsystem is orbitally excited to p - shell with a spatial symmetry @xmath18_x $ ] . in order to give a colored singlet state the four - quark subsystem has the color state @xmath19_c $ ] since the anti - quark is in the @xmath20_c$ ] representation .",

    "for baryon @xmath69@xcite , @xmath70    within the 5-q components , the 4-q subsystem gives no spin contribution to the magnetic moment because symmetry @xmath30_s $ ] gives spin zero .",
    "but every quark in this subsystem has probability of being excited to p - state , which gives an orbital magnetic moment @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the probability of 5-q components .",
    "the anti - quark in its ground state gives a magnetic contribution @xmath73    besides these diagonal contributions from quark spin and orbital motion , the transitions or non - diagonal matrix elements between the @xmath9 and @xmath74 components may have some contributions , too .",
    "however , these non - diagonal contributions depend both on the explicit wave function model and the model for @xmath75 vertices . cases will be more complicated to take into account the confining interaction between the quarks that leads to bound state wave functions@xcite . with a lot of unexplicit parameters",
    ", the results will be very ambiguous .",
    "so , for simplicity , we neglect the contributions of these transition matrix elements in this paper .",

    "m , the number of the baryons , is six here . the error @xmath89 is taken to be the addition of a theoretical error and experimental error in quadrature as in ref.@xcite .",

    ", an analysis for the preferred configuration @xmath21_{fs } [ 22]_f [ 22]_s $ ] shows that the qualitative features of empirical strangeness form factors may be described with a @xmath94 admixture of @xmath10 in the proton .",
    "fixing the @xmath82 with this value and taking only the @xmath81 as variable , the minimum of @xmath95 happens at @xmath96 , ie , the probability of @xmath97 in proton is 0.13 .",

    "the fitting result @xmath99 is not better than that from the cvqm .",
    "the fitting results of the cvqm @xmath100 are showed in the table [ table1 ] with quark masses being @xmath101mev and @xmath102mev .",
    "then , we take both the probabilities of 5-q components @xmath81 and @xmath93 as variables to minimize the eq .. and we find that there are two areas where the minimum can occur : the 3-q component or the 5-q component dominant in the baryons",
    ". as we know , however , the cvqm has success in low - lying baryon spectroscopy and magnetic moment .",
    "the probabilities of non - perturbative sea - quarks may not be very large .",
    "so , we only consider the case that the probabilities of 5-q components are small .",
    "the mathematical minimum of @xmath103 is @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which is inconsistent with the observed excess of @xmath41 over @xmath15 in proton with @xmath107 @xcite .",

    "[ table1 ] , the theoretical errors are computed as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the experimental magnetic moment value , and @xmath121 , the corresponding theoretical value . from the table",
    "[ table1 ] , we can see , except the error of the neutron , that all errors given by the cqcm are less than @xmath122 , which is much better than those given by the cvqm . besides , adding the theoretical errors in quadrature we get @xmath123 , so small than @xmath124 .",
    ".magnetic moments ( in unit of nucleon magnetic moment ) of the six baryons .",
    "the total errors are given by adding to the experimental error a theoretical error 0.08 in quadrature .",
    "the theoretical results including and not including the sea quark contributions are listed in the lines of cqcm and cvqm respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the early emc experiment results of quark spin contributions to the proton are very rough .",
    "the missing spin in this experiment may come from the gluon polarizations , or orbital angular momentum of quarks and gluon . but how large they are is still an open question . in the non - relative quark model",
    ", there is no room for gluons . in the cqcm model with only @xmath125 of @xmath97 in the proton , the spin contributions from quark spin and orbital angular moment are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 .",
    "their sum is equal to 1 , which is guarantied by the wave function eq . to give the total spin of proton .",
    "and we see that the orbital angular moment contributes a lot .",
    "to find the effective degrees of freedom is at the first stage for studying baryon s structure .",
    "the above numerical results have indicated that the non - perturbative effects of strangeness component in the nucleon are small .",
    "the strangeness content of the nucleon is purely a sea quark effect and therefor is a clean and important window to look into the nucleon internal structure and dynamics .",
    "the magnetic moment contribution of strange quark to nucleon is equal to the measured strange form factor at @xmath129 . the empirical value of strange form factor @xmath130 can not give a compelling evidence for nonzero strange quark effects of proton owing to the wide uncertainties@xcite .",
    "the experiment at mainz with result @xmath131 at @xmath132 @xcite and the g0 experiment at jefferson lab @xcite may indicate nonzero @xmath133 and @xmath134 . because these experiments are carried out all in some special @xmath135,the results are still very ambiguous when exploited to @xmath129 . for the strange electric form factor of the proton ,",
    "the recent empirical value is @xmath136 , which is really consistent with zero@xcite .",
    "a recent lattice result show that the strange electric form factor is @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "these may indicate that the pairs of strange and anti - strange quarks popping out of the sea cancel each other so effectively , that they have almost zero contributions to the proton s magnetic moment , charge , or mass .",
    "this agrees with our numerical results .",
    "a very recent analysis of the complete world set of parity - violating electron scattering data also gives a result that the strange form factors are consistent with zero .",
    "further more , recent experiments show that the strangeness contribution to the proton spin is very small @xcite .    besides , we like to note that there is another difference between the cqcm and the @xmath138 meson cloud model , apart form the sign of the strangeness magnetic moment of proton . in the @xmath139 model ,",
    "the s quark normalized to the probability @xmath140 of the @xmath141 configuration yields a fractional contribution @xmath142 to the proton spin .",
    "although the @xmath143 , composed of @xmath144 quarks in valence quark model , is unpolarized , other mechanism may yield @xmath11 quark polarized parallel to the initial proton spin@xcite .",
    "these results contradict the colored quark cluster model in which only the @xmath145 quark give a negative contribution to the proton spin , while the s quark is unpolarized because the spin symmetry of subsystem is @xmath30_s$ ] .",
    "unfortunately , it is unable to measure the polarization of single quark experimentally nowadays .",
    "more deeply theoretical analyses are needed .    in the end ,",
    "the observed non - perturbative quark sea in the nucleon leads us to reexamine the low lying baryon magnetic moments .",
    "we have deduced these magnetic moments in the cqcm and have give a discussion of the possible strange component in the nucleon .",
    "we see that the origin of the anomalous moments of quarks discussed in many works @xcite may be from the sea quark contributions , that the probability of strange component @xmath146 in the proton is less than @xmath147 and the probability of @xmath97 less than @xmath118 , and that the orbital motion has very significant effects on the spin and magnetic moment in the non - relative cqcm . whether there has polarization and about its sign of strange quark in the proton is still under debate .",
    "our numerical results favor the non polarization of strange sea quark in the proton .",

    "<S> using the colored quark cluster model , we study magnetic moments of the octet baryons . we give the values of the magnetic moments of baryons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the results also show that the orbital motion has very significant effects on the spin and magnetic moments of those baryons and the strange component in the proton is very small . </S>"
