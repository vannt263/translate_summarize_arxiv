    "the problem of vibration control for flexible structures arises in a variety of applications such as large space structures , flexible dynamics in air vehicles , nano - positioning , the control of atomic force microscopes and the control of optical interfermetric sensing systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "a particular problem in vibration control for flexible structures is that unmodelled ( spillover ) dynamics can severely degrade the control system performance or lead to instability .",
    "also , uncertainties in mode frequencies and damping can lead to similar problems of poor control system performance or instability ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "an approach to the control of flexible structures which addresses these robustness issues is _ positive - position feedback _ , which involves the use of collocated force actuators and position sensors @xcite . roughly speaking a positive position feedback controller",
    "consists of a transfer function matrix which has the same form as a finite mode model of a flexible structure .",
    "this approach was originally proposed as an alternative to passivity based velocity feedback approaches in the control of large space structures .",
    "the original papers on positive position feedback included stability proofs based on routh - hurwitz and nyquist techniques but the robustness properties were never fully quantified .",
    "the research presented in this paper aims to develop a general systems theory framework for positive position control and related control methods for flexible structures .",
    "an important special case of positive - position feedback involves the use of piezoelectric actuators and sensors .",
    "a positive - position feedback controller can be designed to increase the damping of the modes of a flexible structure .",
    "furthermore , this controller is robust against uncertainty in the modal frequencies as well as unmodelled plant dynamics .",
    "we consider the theory of negative - imaginary systems to reveal the robustness properties of mimo positive - position feedback controllers and related types of controllers for flexible structures ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "the negative - imaginary property of linear systems can be extended to nonlinear systems through the notion of counterclockwise input - output dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite for the single - input , single - output ( siso ) linear case that the results of @xcite guarantee the stability of a positive - position feedback control system in the presence of unmodelled dynamics and parameter uncertainties that maintain the negative - imaginary property of the plant .      in modeling an undamped flexible structure with collocated force actuators and position sensors ,",
    "modal analysis can be applied to the relevant partial differential equation leading to the transfer function matrix @xmath0 where , for all @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is an @xmath5 vector .",
    "therefore , the _ hermitian - imaginary part _",

    "we thus refer to the transfer function matrix @xmath10 as negative imaginary .",
    "any flexible structure with collocated force actuators and position sensors will have a negative imaginary transfer function matrix .",

    "<S> this paper covers recent developments in the theory of negative imaginary systems and their application to the control of highly resonant flexible structures . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of negative imaginary systems arose out of a desire to unify a number of classical methods for the control of lightly damped structures with collocated force actuators and position sensors including positive position feedback and integral force feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the key result is a stability result which shows why these methods are guaranteed to yield robust closed loop stability in the face of unmodelled spillover dynamics </S>",
    "<S> . related results to be presented connect the theory of negative imaginary systems to positive real systems theory and a negative imaginary lemma has been established which is analogous to the positive real lemma . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also presents recent controller synthesis results based on the theory of negative imaginary systems . </S>"
