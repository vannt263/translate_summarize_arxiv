    "observations in our galaxy and in the local group of galaxies ( lggs ) have revealed that giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) have masses of about @xmath4 to 10@xmath5m@xmath6 and sizes of 50 to several hundred of parsecs , which are often found associated with hii regions and ob associations , tracers of massive star formation ( sf ) .",
    "massive stars , which are commonly found clustered in ob associations , are short - lived ( less than a few 10myr ) , and thus spend most of their lifetime within the cluster in which they were formed .",
    "this suggests that gmcs are the principal sites of massive sf .",
    "however , how sf occurs in a gmc , the so - called `` gmc evolution '' , has remained poorly understood because it has been difficult to perform molecular gas observations with a combination of high resolution , sensitivity and wide field to enable studies of a sufficiently large sample of gmcs .",
    "such studies in lggs have the potential to reveal the density distribution and kinematics at gmc scales , as well as its relation to ongoing sf .",
    "several studies focusing on gmc evolution in the large magellanic clouds ( lmc ) have been performed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gmcs in the lmc are classified into three types according to their associated massive sf activities : type  i showing no signature of massive sf , type  ii being associated with relatively small hii regions , and type  iii with both hii regions and young ( less than 10myr old ) stellar clusters @xcite . while in general the positions of young clusters are correlated with gmcs , the clusters older than 10myr have a weaker or no correlation with the gmcs @xcite .",
    "this classification was interpreted to be a template for the gmc evolutionary stages , and the typical lifetime of gmcs with masses larger than @xmath7m@xmath6 is estimated to be 2030myr @xcite .",
    "analyses of the kinetic temperature and density of several gmcs in lmc shows that they increase generally as the gmcs evolve .",
    "this confirms that the denser and warmer molecular gas is directly linked to sf activities . because these studies are only limited to several specific gmcs in one irregular galaxy , it is still necessary to investigate the properties of gmcs in the different environments present in other galaxies , in order to complete our current knowledge of templates for gmc evolution .",
    "m33 is one of the best laboratories to study gmc evolutions under different environments due to its proximity ( distance of 840kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , favorable inclination ( @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the existence of spiral structure and massive sf regions .",
    "m33 is the second closest spiral galaxy after m31 , but m33 is less inclined , which is ideal to resolve gas components or individual stars with little contamination along the line of sight .",
    "also , studying gmcs over a disk galaxy enable us to compare all gmcs at the same distance , unlike in our galaxy .",
    "surveys of @xmath9co(@xmath3 ) and @xmath9co(@xmath10 ) emission in m33 to investigate the relation between molecular gas and massive sf have been conducted by several authors .",
    "@xcite have found that more than two - thirds of the gmcs in m33 are associated with hii regions within 50pc , which is similar to the proportion in lmc @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation between the molecular gas surface densities traced by co(@xmath3 ) emission and that of sf rate ( sfr ) , the so - called kennicutt ",
    "schmidt law ( hereafter k - s law ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a pixel - to - pixel analysis is found to be weaker at 80pc resolutions @xcite than at lower resolutions ( 200pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the gmcs traced by co(@xmath3 ) are well correlated with the massive sf sites , but their peaks are offset from each other .",
    "recently , the k - s law using co(@xmath0 ) in m33 has shown a tight correlation at 100pc resolution , unlike co(@xmath3 ) ( onodera et al . 2013 , pasj , accepted ) .",
    "in fact , with higher resolution data , @xcite have found that the co(@xmath0 ) emission is spatially better correlated to massive sf sites than co(@xmath3 ) in the most luminous giant hii region ( ghr ) in m33 , ngc  604 .",
    "this supports that the dense and warm gas traced by co(@xmath0 ) is more closely linked to the sf sites , as previously argued in four virgo galaxies in @xcite .",
    "these results are interpreted as higher kinetic temperatures and densities in gmcs found close to ghrs , in agreement with large velocity gradient ( lvg ) analysis with multi-@xmath11 co transition data by @xcite and @xcite .    as part of the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) m33 all - disk survey of giant molecular clouds ( magic )",
    "project @xcite , here we present a catalog of m33 gmcs using new co(@xmath0 ) maps with @xmath12 ( corresponding to 100pc ) resolution . in order to investigate the relation of the gmcs with massive sf , we also present a `` young stellar group ( ysg ) '' catalog . in this work",
    ", ysgs can be clusters ( typical sizes of 15pc ) , ob associations ( typical sizes of @xmath1315100pc ) , and star complexes ( sizes of a few hundred pc ) .",
    "there are a number of catalogs for clusters , ob associations , and star complexes in m33 published so far ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter sm ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the number of star clusters whose ages have been estimated is limited , and the methods to derive the ages are not homogenous ( sm and references therein ; @xcite , hereafter ppl ; @xcite , hereafter ssgh ) .",

    "[ p3:res ] we explain the general procedure for identifying gmcs , as well as the identification of ysgs and the estimation of their ages .",
    "we classify gmcs as a function of the age of ysgs associated with them .",
    "we also quantify the sf activities and dense gas fractions in the gmcs using the extinction - corrected h@xmath14 data and the co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath3 ) line ratio , @xmath15 , and then show the variety of physical states of the identified gmcs . in section  [ p3:disc ] ,",

    "we chose eight regions covering the northern and southern spiral arms as well as the galaxy center , where the co(@xmath3 ) emission is prominent @xcite .",
    "the co(@xmath0 ) ( rest frequency : 345.796ghz ) mapping observations were performed between june and november 2011 , using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; * ? ? ?",

    "the chopper - wheel technique was employed to calibrate the antenna temperature @xmath18 and the final data has been converted into units of main beam brightness temperature ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 is the main beam efficiency , measured to be @xmath21 using the standard source orion kl at ( @xmath22 , @xmath23)=(05@xmath2435@xmath25145 , 0522296 ) . hereafter , all the co intensity measurements are specified in @xmath26 .",
    "the typical system temperatures in a single side band were usually less than 200k .",
    "the absolute pointing accuracy was verified by observing the co(@xmath0 ) emission of o - cet at 11.5 hr intervals , and it was kept better than 4@xmath17 rms .",
    "the absolute intensity stability was also monitored using o - cet during the different observing runs and was found to be stable within @xmath27% .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with the nobeyama otf software tools for analysis and reduction package ( nostar , * ? ? ?",
    "the `` scanning noise '' was removed by combining scans using the plait algorithm as described by .",

    "the lack of background subtraction may cause a systematic shift in the extinction - corrected h@xmath14 luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , instead",

    "we use the catalog of @xmath43 sources in , which is the only reference listing 24@xmath39 sources to date , for the sake of comparing the positions of hii regions .",
    "the gmc catalog is obtained from our co(@xmath0 ) data using the cprops package described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we search for compact emission in adjacent pairs of channels with @xmath44 , the so - called _ cores _ , and then for emission with @xmath45 connected to such cores .",
    "cprops attempts to account for the amount of flux below the 2@xmath46 cutoff by linearly extrapolating the emission profile to the @xmath47 intensity level . finally , the emission identified with cprops must have a minimum velocity width of 2 channels ( @xmath48 ) with a minimum peak of @xmath44 , and an equivalent size of at least the spatial resolution of 25@xmath17 ( @xmath13100pc )",

    "the virial mass , calculated under the assumption that each cloud is spherical and can be parametrized by a density profile @xmath53 , is given by @xmath54 @xcite , where @xmath55 is the deconvolved radius given by deconvolving the beam size ( @xmath56 ) from the gmc size , i.e. , @xmath57^{1/2}[a^2_{\\rm min}-\\theta^2_{\\rm beam}]^{1/2}}$ ] .",
    "note that the virial masses of 27 gmcs are not shown because their minor diameters are smaller than the beam size .    among the 71 gmcs in our catalog ,",

    "gmc-50 is located outside of the observed field in and has a marginal detection in the co(@xmath3 ) integrated intensity map in @xcite , but was not identified in their catalog .",
    "a total of 10 gmcs in our catalog are composed of more than two smaller gmcs in previous catalogs , due to their higher resolution data . on the other hand ,",
    "a few single gmcs in the @xcite s catalog appear to be composed of more than two gmcs in our catalog .",
    "this is because of our 815 times better sensitivity data , since decomposition of neighboring clouds is done based on peak differences exceeding 2 @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the i d numbers in these cases are marked with an asterisk in table  [ p3:co32cprops ] .",
    "since 6 gmcs ( gmc-18 , gmc-28 , gmc-47 , gmc-51 , gmc-58 , and gmc-71 ) are at the edge of the observed fields and their extents are uncertain , they are not included in further analysis and discussion .",

    "the @xmath49 , @xmath55 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are in the range of 1.217.3kms@xmath16 , 12157pc , ( 0.825.8)@xmath58kkms@xmath16 pc@xmath38 , and ( 0.289.2)@xmath3710@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "a lower limit for the virial mass is @xmath60 , assuming an effective radius of @xmath1350pc and @xmath61 , which are close to the instrumental limits .",

    "note that we have used the non - deconvolved radius for the gmcs whose minor axes were smaller than the beam size , and thus the averaged @xmath55 and @xmath51 should be regarded as upper limits .",
    "these averaged values are within the typical range as traced by co(@xmath3 ) in lggs .    compared to the high - resolution co(@xmath0 ) observations towards clumps in lmc , the @xmath55 and @xmath51 of m33 gmcs are larger than the typical values of lmc clumps , i.e. @xmath6612.4pc and @xmath67@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this is likely only due to our more limited spatial resolution , because the @xmath49 of m33 gmcs is similar to that of the clumps at high resolution , @xmath49 of @xmath137kms@xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that the m33 gmcs obtained in this work are composed of a single or a few small clumps at a similar velocity , but not a large amount of clumps .",
    "the co(@xmath0 ) and co(@xmath3 ) integrated intensity maps and also the co intensity ratio ( @xmath15 ) map for each individual gmc , with a common 25@xmath17 resolution , are shown in panels ( a)(c ) of figures  [ fig6-gmc-60 ]  [ fig6-gmc-16 ] and figures  18  78 in the appendix",
    ". the integrated intensity maps of co(@xmath0 ) emission have been created by using the channel maps where the emission is above 2@xmath28 .",
    "the integrated intensity maps of co(@xmath3 ) emission have been binned over the same velocity ranges as that of co(@xmath0 ) emission .",
    "we find a general trend that the distribution of co(@xmath0 ) emission and peaks are similar to that of co(@xmath3 ) ( e.g. , gmc-3 in figure  19 , gmc-5 in figure  21 ) .",
    "however , in some cases ( @xmath69 ) , the co(@xmath0 ) emission for some gmcs shows more compact distribution ( e.g. , gmc-1 in figure  [ fig6-gmc-1 ] , gmc-8 in figure  [ fig6-gmc-8 ] ) . in other gmcs ( @xmath70 ) , the co(@xmath0 ) emission peak is offset from the co(@xmath3 ) emission peak by over half hpbw ( e.g. , gmc-1 in figure  [ fig6-gmc-1 ] , gmc-7 in figure  23 ) .",
    "a further description of the spatial comparison between co emission and massive sf sites is presented later in section  [ sec3.4.1 ] .",
    "we have calculated @xmath15 by dividing the co(@xmath3 ) map by the co(@xmath0 ) map , after masking the region where the co(@xmath3 ) emission is below 3@xmath71 in its integrated intensity map .",
    "note that each @xmath15 map is masked except inside the boundary of the gmc , to avoid confusion with neighboring gmcs .",
    "the @xmath15 values across gmcs vary greatly .",
    "some gmcs are found to have a gradient of @xmath15 , while others have a relatively constant ratio .",

    "that the @xmath15 for these gmcs is uncertain , we calculate the lower limit of @xmath15 at the co(@xmath0 ) emission peak ( see captions in each figure ) .",
    "figure  [ p3:co32gmcprop_hist ] shows the histogram of @xmath15 for the 65 gmcs .",
    "the averaged @xmath15 ranges from 0.18 to 0.89 , with a mean of 0.43 .",

    "however , the sensitivity restricts the contained ysgs to be less massive than @xmath160 ( @xmath13b1v star ) ( section [ p3:4321 ] ) , and type c ( ysgs with ages @xmath161myr ) are typically more massive than that .",

    "if a m33 gmc is composed of two different types of gmcs , for example types  b and c , whose sizes are comparable to those in lmc , then the gmc would have been classified as type  c. therefore , the classifications will be affected .",
    "second , regarding the different tracers used , the m33 gmcs identified from co(@xmath0 ) data represent the denser and/or warmer molecular gas which is more directly linked to massive sf , while the lmc gmcs identified from co(@xmath3 ) data trace the bulk of the molecular gas . in fact , in the case of m33 gmcs identified by using co(@xmath3 ) data , more than two - thirds have associated hii regions @xcite , which is a similar proportion in lmc @xcite .",

    "since there is no correlation between hii regions or ysgs , we infer that type  a is at an evolutionary stage before massive sf . in the case of lmc with 40pc resolution and using the co(@xmath3 ) line @xcite , @xcite",
    "have shown that about a quarter of all gmcs are type  a. possible reasons that so few gmcs in m33 are classified as type  a are spatial resolution and sensitivity limit and the choice of the molecular gas tracer , as explained in section  [ p3:sec534 ] .",
    "type  b gmcs , which are associated with hii regions but not with ysgs , are interpreted as being at an evolutionary stage just after the formation of massive stars , such as a single o7.5v star or later ob type stars , that are still partly embedded to be seen in the optical as ysgs .",
    "we suggest that type  c gmcs being associated both with hii regions and very young stellar groups ( less than 10myr ) are at an evolutionary stage with active massive star formation , as massive as earlier types than o7.5v stars .",
    "type  d gmcs associated with hii regions and relatively old ( 1030myr ) stellar groups are considered to be at an evolutionary stage where they have been continuously forming massive stars for over at least 10myr .",
    "we find that @xmath15 is enhanced around the massive sf sites for types  b , c and d gmcs ( section  [ p3:gmc8][p3:gmc16 ] ) . in order to roughly quantify the offset between them , we plot in figure  [ p3:mindist ] the number of pixels above a certain @xmath15 ( 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 0.9 ) as a function of the distance to its closest ysg .",
    "the average sizes of the 75 ysgs are shown in the same figure , for reference .",
    "the dashed lines represent the frequency distribution expected if the same number of ysgs are distributed at random in the observed area .",
    "it shows that the distance to the nearest ysg becomes smaller as @xmath15 increases , but it must be noted that the @xmath15 peaks and the nearest ysgs do not coincide in general .",
    "we can assume that @xmath15 is a good tracer of density when @xmath171 , if kinetic temperature is low ( @xmath1320k ) , as explained in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that dense molecular gas fraction is enhanced in the vicinity of previously formed ysgs . for regions with high @xmath172 ,",
    "the molecular gas can have a higher kinetic temperature due to the nearest ghrs and ysgs ( within @xmath1350pc ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the suggestion by @xcite that the ghrs may raise the kinetic temperature of the neighboring ( @xmath173pc ) molecular gas .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of dense molecular gas fraction around the previously formed massive stars imply that once sf starts , dense gas formation is favored around the sf sites , which will then lead to the next generation of sf .",
    "next we estimate a lower limit of the lifetime of a gmc from the age of the oldest stellar group contained within the gmc , assuming that the gmcs and ysgs are being formed in a nearly steady evolution .",
    "if the classification is done based on the oldest stellar group within a gmc , the frequency distribution of each type is 1 ( 2% ) , 13 ( 20% ) , 19 ( 29% ) , and 32 ( 49% ) out of 65 selected gmcs .",
    "the ysgs associated with type  c and type  d gmcs are @xmath174myr and @xmath175myr old on average , respectively .",
    "therefore , we estimate that the timescale for each evolutionary stage is @xmath174 and @xmath176myr in type  c and type  d , from the age difference between the associated ysgs .",
    "if we further assume that the timescale for each evolutionary stage is proportional to the number of gmcs , then types  a , b , c , and d are estimated to be @xmath131 , 37 , 510 , and 817myr , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the typical lifetime ( from type  a to type  d ) of a gmc with masses of @xmath177 is roughly 2040myr .",
    "note that these results do not change significantly when we use only 44 gmcs with accurate ages for their ysgs ( section  [ p3:sec534 ] ) .    in lmc , the lifetime of a gmc with mass as small as @xmath178 was estimated to be 2030myr @xcite .",
    "the timescales of types  a , b and c in lmc ( corresponding to types  i , ii and iii ) are 6myr , 13myr , and 7myr , respectively .",
    "the timescales for type  b in m33 are smaller than that in lmc , and for type  c they are similar or slightly larger .",
    "it is not appropriate to compare the lifetime for type  a in m33 and in lmc because of the limited number of gmcs in this type .",
    "no classification exists for lmc gmcs after type  c , thus we can not compare ( see section  [ p3:sec534 ] for a discussion ) . taking into account that m33 gmcs are a few times larger than the lmc gmcs , m33 type  c and d gmcs",
    "are possibly composed of smaller clouds .",
    "if that is the case , these small clouds in m33 type  c and d may not be coeval .",
    "this can explain the fact that the timescale of type  c gmcs in m33 are slightly larger than in lmc .    as a conclusion",
    ", we propose a scenario as follows .",
    "first , dense gas formation occurs at a certain place in a gmc .",
    "after the molecular gas become dense enough to form stars ( type  a ) , massive sf occurs in such dense regions , forming hii regions ( type  b ) .",
    "about 48myr later , the first formed ysgs are not embedded anymore and become visible ( type  c ) .",
    "subsequent dense molecular gas formation occurs due to the effect of previously formed ysgs and the next generation stars are born in such a dense gas ( type  d ) . in this way , the sf propagates from initially generated stars , until the reservoir of molecular gas is exhausted .",
    "such a continuous sf can last at least 1030myr in a gmc with a typical mass of @xmath177 during their lifetime of 2040myr ( after the dense gas formation ) .",
    "we present a gmc catalog using wide field ( 121arcmin@xmath38 in total ) and high sensitivity ( 1@xmath17932mk in @xmath26 for a velocity resolution of 2.5kms@xmath16 ) co(@xmath0 ) maps of the nearby spiral galaxy m33 taken with the aste 10-m dish , and a complementary new catalog of ysgs for which we have estimated the ages .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows :    1 .",
    "we identify 71 co(@xmath0 ) gmcs from the co(@xmath0 ) data .",
    "we discard from the analysis 6 gmcs which are at the edges of the observed field .",
    "the remaining 65 gmcs are characterized by the deconvolved sizes in the range of 12157pc in radius and virial masses of @xmath180@xmath181@xmath131 , which are comparable to those of gmcs in our galaxy .",
    "we identify 75 ysgs from the excess of the surface density map of young stars that are associated with the identified gmcs .",
    "the total number of o stars in a ysg spans from 9169 , corresponding to total stellar masses of 10@xmath18210@xmath183 , assuming that they have a salpeter imf .",
    "the ysg ages are also estimated using the padova model , and are found to be in the range of 431myr ( 12myr on average ) .",
    "these values are comparable to those of typical ob associations .",
    "we compare the gmcs with the distribution of ysgs and classical hii regions from a compilation in the literature .",
    "the identified 65 gmcs are successfully classified into four categories : type  a showing no sign of massive sf , type  b being associated only with relatively small hii regions , type  c with both hii regions and young ( @xmath9810myr ) stellar groups , and type  d with both hii regions and relatively old ( 1030myr ) stellar groups . out of the 65 gmcs , 1 ( 1% ) , 13 ( 20% ) , 29 ( 45% ) , and 22 ( 34% ) are found to be types  a , b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "4 .   from a comparison of the distributions of the co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath3 ) intensity ratio , @xmath15 , with the ysgs and hii regions , we find that the @xmath15 peaks within a gmc are slightly offset from the sf sites , but preferentially located around them",
    "we interpret the four types as representing an evolutionary sequence of the gmcs . assuming that the number of the gmc types is proportional to the timescale of each evolutionary stage",
    ", we roughly estimate that they are @xmath131 , 37 , 510 , and 817myr , respectively for types  a , b , c , and d. this yields that the lifetime of a gmc with mass of @xmath177 is 2040myr , similar or slightly larger than the lifetime of lmc clouds . 6 .",
    "finally , we propose a scenario where after molecular gas becomes dense enough to form stars , massive sf occurs in such dense part .",
    "then the molecular gas around the first generation stars becomes dense and forms the new generation of stars . in this way ,",
    "the sf propagates from the initially generated massive stars and continues during the gmc lifetime .",

    "<S> we present a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) catalog toward m33 , containing 71 gmcs in total , based on wide field and high sensitivity co(@xmath0 ) observations with a spatial resolution of 100pc using the aste 10 m telescope . employing archival optical data </S>",
    "<S> , we identify 75 young stellar groups ( ysgs ) from the excess of the surface stellar density , and estimate their ages by comparing with stellar evolution models . </S>",
    "<S> a spatial comparison among the gmcs , ysgs , and hii regions enable us to classify gmcs into four categories : type  a showing no sign of massive star formation ( sf ) , type  b being associated only with hii regions , type  c with both hii regions and @xmath1myr - old ysgs and type - d with both hii regions and 1030 myr ysgs . out of 65 gmcs </S>",
    "<S> ( discarding those at the edges of the observed fields ) , 1 ( 1% ) , 13 ( 20% ) , 29 ( 45% ) , and 22 ( 34% ) are types  a , b , c , and d , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these categories as stages in a gmc evolutionary sequence . assuming that the timescale for each evolutionary stage is proportional to the number of gmcs , the lifetime of a gmc with a mass @xmath2 is estimated to be 2040myr . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the dense gas fraction as traced by the co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath3 ) ratio is enhanced around sf regions . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms a scenario where dense gas is preferentially formed around previously generated stars , and will be the fuel for the next stellar generation . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , massive sf gradually propagates in a gmc until gas is exhausted . </S>"
