    "v__=11.8 ) is a rather neglected variable star discovered by hoffmeister ( 1935 ) and given the original designation 184.1930 .",
    "it is a suspected member of the cool algols ( popper , 1996 ) and was reported by the author as a double - lined system with a period of 3.85 days and a mean spectral type of g5 , although other sources have classified it as f8 ( e.g. , halbedel 1984 ) .",
    "mader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented new spectroscopic and _ bvri _ photometric observations of av del .",
    "they determined the radial - velocities for both components , using the two - dimensional cross - correlation technique todcor ( zucker & mazeh 1994 ) .",
    "they showed the system to be most likely semi - detached , with the less massive and cooler star filling its roche lobe .    as we will see in section 2 , there are evidences for a mass transfer in av del .",
    "so we thought it is useful to study the existence of mass transfer and the nature of the system using the new shellspec code which is a strong program to analyze those stars have accretion disc and circumstellar material .",
    "first , we present the analysis of the system using the wilson - devinney ( 1971 ) wd code in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "we present here a new light and radial - velocity curves analysis , and then we determine the physical and absolute parameters of the system .",
    "the absolute parameters are given in section 5 .",
    "analysis of the system using the shellspec code is explained in section 6 .",
    "in this paper , we consider _ b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ and _ i _ filters observations of mader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . the latest version of wd code is applied to solve the light and radial - velocity curves .",
    "after obtaining the absolute parameters of the components , we used the shellspec code to derive the parameters of the disc . throughout this paper ,",
    "the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the primary ( hotter ) and the secondary ( cooler ) components , respectively .    during using wd code , for",
    "both components of the system , we used bolometric linear , logarithmic and square root law for the limb darkening and the best result was obtained for bolometric logarithmic limb darkening law of klinlesmith & sobieski ( 1970 ) with the following form :    @xmath12    where the limb darkening coefficients _ x _ and _ y _ for both components were fixed to their theoretical values , interpolated using van hamme s ( 1993 ) formula which are tabulated in table 1 .    the gravity darkening exponent from lucy ( 1967 ) and the bolometric albedos from rucinski ( 2001 ) were chosen for convective envelopes ( g=0.32 , @xmath13 ) , which are in good agreement with the final surface temperature . in order to reduce the number of the free parameters , these parameters were kept constant during all iterations . also , it is assumed that this binary system has zero orbital eccentricity ( @xmath14 ) and that its rotational and orbital spins are synchronous ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "also , black body radiation models are employed , and we assume that there is no third light ( @xmath16 ) for the system .",
    "mader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) calculated a linear ephemeris :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the number of cycles counted from the epoch of reference and the uncertainties are given in parentheses in units of the last significant digit .",
    "a period study of av del was carried out by qian ( 2002 ) on the basis of fewer times of eclipse .",
    "a small period increase of about @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 was reported by qian ( 2002 ) , while the other quadratic fit derived by mader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) gives :    @xmath22    which corresponds to a period change of @xmath23 @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "these period changes may be related to the mass transfer presumably taking place in the system .",
    "the main goal of this paper is that show whether these period changes are related to the mass transfer or not ? also , we want to find if there is a real mass transfer in the system , what kind of material is corresponded it ?    [ cols=\"^ ,",

    "comparing the new photometric - spectroscopic solutions of the systems with those of given in literature , the present authors can get following conclusions :    in our study , we may conclude that av del is an eclipsing binary system which we have employed a new tools called shellspec code to solve its light curve .",
    "we have presented a new configuration for the system that consists an accretion disc surrounding the primary star . as it is given in table 6 , the accretion disc has the shape of a cylinder . its vertical half - thickness ( 1.2 @xmath24 )",
    "is comparable to the radius of the primary star .",
    "the distance between the primary and the secondary centers is about 13.3 @xmath24 and the outer radius of the disc is 8 @xmath24 .",
    "so , since the radius of the primary and the secondary are about 2.6 @xmath24 and 4.2 @xmath24 , respectively , the outer limb of the disc is about 1.1 @xmath24 far from the secondary surface .",
    "therefore , our results are realistic . according to the disc dimensions",
    ", it is a thick disc which its temperature is more than the temperature of the secondary and slightly less than the temperature of the primary .",
    "altogether , on the basis of our results , av del has an accretion disc , while mader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) rejected existence of activity in the system since they did nt found obvious signs of activity displayed by the system .",
    "however , since there are so many free parameters of the disc , we can not claim that our fit is a unique solution ( see budaj et al .",
    "2005 ) , but existence of the disc in the system is certain .",
    "so , the period changes that were saw in the system ( qian , 2002 ) can be related to the mass transfer between two components which has created the accretion disc .",
    "finally , popper ( 1996 ) has noticed `` although the two components appear to have comparable luminosities , the hotter and smaller component has the larger mass , with a mass ratio very provisionally about 1.9 '' .",
    "so , according to the values we derived , our results confirm his results .",
    "also , the absolute elements of both components determine the evolutionary state of the system . entering the results in the mass - luminosity ( m - l ) , @xmath26-mass ( m - m ) , mass - radius ( m - r ) and h - r diagrams (",
    "the diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "6 ) , it appears that av del contains a main - sequence primary star , while its secondary is on its way to the giant stage ."
