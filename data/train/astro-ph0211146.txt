    "very few stars are known to have proper motions @xmath6 yr@xmath1 . the lhs catalog @xcite lists only 60 systems ( which include 9 resolved doubles and 2 resolved triples ) with proper motions in that range , and few systems have been added since .",
    "the discovery of a faint @xmath7 yr@xmath1 white dwarf ( =) was reported by @xcite .",
    "more recently , the candidate halo white dwarf was discovered by @xcite ; its proper motion is @xmath8 yr@xmath1 .",
    "most of these extremely rare objects are very nearby stars , within 10pc of the sun .",
    ", our closest neighbor , has a proper motion @xmath9 yr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , a few of the very high proper motion stars lie beyond 10pc , which means they have velocities relative to the sun that are larger than 100 km s@xmath1 , and they are likely to be local members of the galactic thick disk or halo .",
    "one example is the nearby subdwarf ( @xmath10 yr@xmath1 , spectral type sdk4 ) , which is a very likely member of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the star with the largest known proper motion is the star discovered by @xcite , which bears his name and is moving at @xmath11 yr@xmath1 ; barnard s star , with spectral type m4.0 v @xcite , is believed to be a member of the thick disk @xcite .",
    "apart from the two faint white dwarfs mentioned above , all the known stars with @xmath6 yr@xmath1 are relatively bright ; none of them is fainter than r=15",
    ". this may be an observational bias , since faint stars with very large proper motions are notoriously difficult to find .",
    "on the other hand , it is the faintest components of the halo that are expected to be detected as faint high proper motion stars .",
    "the fact that few faint stars with large proper motion are known may simply reflect the very low local density of low - luminosity halo stars . clearly , the discovery of faint ( @xmath12 ) stars with proper motions",
    "@xmath6 yr@xmath1 can have profound implications for our understanding of the density , composition , and kinematics of the halo .    in this letter",
    ", we report the discovery of , a very faint ( r@xmath13 ) star with a proper motion of @xmath0 yr@xmath1 . our spectroscopy shows the star to be an m8.5 dwarf at a distance of about 13.9pc , moving relative to the local standard of rest with a velocity of about 175 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this low - mass star appears to have an orbit that is most consistent with membership in the galactic halo .",
    "the very high proper motion star was discovered through our automated search for stars with large proper motion using the digitized sky survey @xcite , undertaken as part of the nstars program .",
    "the star was found in a relatively crowded milky way field at galactic latitude b=+18.31 . the very large proper motion of the star is above the detection threshold of our superblink software , and it was not initially flagged as a high proper motion star .",
    "however , superblink also identifies candidate variable objects as it compares the digitized sky survey poss - i ( xx103ae+plexi ) and poss - ii ( iiiaf+rg610 ) scanned red plates .",
    "was first noticed as a pair of candidate variable stars lying within about @xmath14 of each other ; one star showing up in the poss - i plate only , the other one in the poss - ii plate only . suspecting this could be a star with an extremely large proper motion",
    ", we searched for archival images of this field at different epochs .",
    "the digitized sky survey includes 3 more images of the field around .",
    "the quick - v northern plate ( iiad+w12 ) does nt go deep enough to detect the star ; the poss - ii blue plate ( iiiaj+gg385 ) shows a very faint star , near the detection limit , at the location expected for a high proper motion star .",
    "the poss - ii near - ir ( ivn+rg9 ) plate shows a relatively bright star again at the location expected for a star with a very large proper motion . to provide definitive evidence that the star is a high proper motion object , we obtained an r band image of the same field at the calypso telescope ( kitt peak ) in april 2002 .",
    "we found again the star at the exact location expected for a very high proper motion object .",
    "the 3 epochs of red band images are displayed in figure 1 . shown",
    "are @xmath15 sections of the poss - i red , poss - ii red , and calypso r - band image .",
    "the high proper motion star is indicated by a circle .",
    "the three images span over 50 years , during which time has moved by a little more than @xmath14 .",
    "we reprocessed the poss - i and poss - ii plates for this region of the sky with superblink , this time allowing for the detection of stars with proper motions up to @xmath16 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this time the software easily identified , and calculated a proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .",
    "the proper motion measured by superblink is the proper motion of the star calculated relative to the mean position of all objects within @xmath17 of the candidate high proper motion star ( image superposition ) ; the astrometric solutions from the first digitized sky survey are used to obtain the local scale of the scanned plate .    with a proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ,",
    "ranks as the stellar system with the 42nd largest proper motion on the sky , and one of the faintest stars known with a proper motion larger than 2@xmath18 yr@xmath1 . appears to be headed towards the bulge of a background galaxy ( see figure 1 ) . by extrapolating the motion of the star",
    ", we estimate that it will move within @xmath19 of the centroid of the core of that galaxy around the 2006.5 epoch .",
    "we observed on 12 april , 2002 under photometric conditions using the calypso observatory @xcite wide field camera in the johnson bv , and cousins ri filters .",
    "standard stars from the @xcite catalog were observed and used for the absolute calibration of the object .",
    "the landolt magnitudes of the standard stars were converted to the johnson - cousins system .",
    "all frames were debiased and flat - fielded using iraf @xcite .",
    "the object and standard stars were measured in each of multiple frames using the apphot package in iraf and the results were averaged .",
    "we used apertures with fwhm comparable to the seeing ( 4.5 pixels = 0.675@xmath18 ) and used bright stars to derive a correction to 100% light . using the multiple frames we derived an external error for the measurements of 0.03 mag in the b filter and 0.01 mag or better in the other filters .",
    "the final b , v , r and i magnitudes for the star are listed in table 1 .",
    "the star was also identified in the 2mass second incremental release as the bright point source .",
    "the corresponding 2mass source was found within 0.33@xmath18 of the predicted location of at the epoch of the 2mass images .",
    "the 2mass j , h , and k@xmath20 magnitudes are listed in table 1 .",
    "the star was observed at lick observatory on july 6 , 2002 using the kast spectrograph installed at the cassegrain focus of the 3 m shane telescope .",
    "we used the 600 l / mm grating blazed at 7500  to obtain a spectrum covering the range 6300-9100  with a resolution of 2.33  per pixel .",
    "the star was imaged through a @xmath21 wide slit , and with the slit oriented vertically to avoid slit loss due to differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "standard spectral reduction was performed with the specred package in iraf , including normalization using a spectrophotometric standard and removal of telluric lines .",
    "the resulting spectrum is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "spectral classification was performed by visual comparison with the standard sequence found in @xcite .",
    "we found our spectrum of to be most similar to an m8.5 v dwarf .",
    "we also used the values of the standard m dwarf spectral indexes defined in @xcite .",
    "the combined values of the vo1 , tio6 , vo2 , and tio7 indexes are consistent with a spectral type m8.5 v.    the radial velocity was estimated by comparing the spectrum of with the spectrum of the radial velocity standard hr7002 , an m6 giant , which we had observed immediately after on the night of july 6 .",
    "we estimated the difference in radial velocity between the two stars by shifting the spectrum of hr7002 to match the tio bandhead at 7050  ( the two stars had virtually the same heliocentric correction at the time of observation ) .",
    "the best fit was obtained with a + 6 km s@xmath1 shift of the hr7002 template , with a possible error of @xmath22 10 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the star hr7002 has a measured radial velocity v@xmath23=+70.8 km s@xmath1 @xcite which yields a radial velocity v@xmath23=@xmath24 km s@xmath1 for .",
    "we use the newly calibrated ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) relationships of @xcite to obtain a photometric parallax for .",
    "the @xmath27 color implies an absolute magnitude @xmath28=18.72 and suggests a distance of d=@xmath29pc .",
    "the @xmath30 color implies an absolute magnitude @xmath31=13.47 , which in turn suggests a distance of d=@xmath32pc .",
    "we also use the absolute magnitude / spectral type relationship calibrated by @xcite to obtain a spectroscopic parallax for the star ; a spectral type of m8.5v is consistent with an absolute magnitude @xmath33=10.18 , which suggests a distance of d=@xmath34pc .",
    "note that the spectroscopic distance is consistent with the photometric distance .",
    "the mean value of the three distance estimates is d=@xmath35pc .",
    "each of the color / magnitude and spectral type / magnitude relationships has a scatter of about @xmath36 magnitudes , which corresponds to a distance error of @xmath2225% , or @xmath223.5pc .",
    "we therefore adopt for an estimated distance of d@xmath37pc .",
    "these results can be compared with the recent compilation of late - type m dwarfs and l dwarfs with geometric parallaxes by @xcite .",
    "one finds that the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 magnitudes of are all consistent with an m8.5 dwarf at a distance of 13 - 15pc .    using the proper motion , distance estimate , and measured radial velocity for",
    ", we calculate the motion of the star relative to the local standard of rest in @xmath41 $ ] space , where @xmath42 is the velocity toward the galactic center , @xmath43 is the velocity toward the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath44 the velocity toward the north galactic pole .",
    "we use as the motion of the sun relative to the local standard of rest the values estimated by @xcite : @xmath41=[+10,+5,+7]$]km s@xmath1 .",
    "we find the velocity components of to be @xmath42=+92@xmath2222 km s@xmath1 , @xmath43=-26@xmath2217 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath44=+134@xmath2230 km s@xmath1 relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "using these values , we can calculate the probable orbit of the star .",
    "we use the galactic mass model by @xcite , which includes separate terms for the bulge , disk , and halo .",
    "we integrate with a runge - kutta fourth order integrator , in time steps of @xmath45 yr .",
    "figure 3 shows a 950 myr integration of the orbit of the star plotted in the [ r , z ] plane , where r is the galactocentric distance in cylindrical coordinates , and z is the distance from the plane . the star is shown to oscillate between 5.5kpc@xmath46r@xmath4614.5kpc , and -6.0kpc@xmath46z@xmath46 + 6.0kpc , which strongly suggests that is a member of the galactic halo .",
    "its spectrum , however , is not consistent with a very metal - poor object .",
    "it is thus possible that is a star initially born in the disk that later got ejected into the halo .",
    "based on its kinematics , is most likely to be a relatively old ( @xmath475gyr ) object .",
    "comparison with the evolutionary model of @xcite shows that the j and k magnitudes of are consistent with those of a 5 - 10 gyr old star with a mass @xmath48 .",
    "the star is thus relatively close to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "we have discovered one of the faintest stars on the sky with a proper motion @xmath49yr@xmath1 . the star is a low mass red dwarf of spectral type m8.5v at a distance of 13.9@xmath223.5pc from the sun .",
    "it is moving on the sky with a proper motion of 2.38@xmath18 yr@xmath1 and has a spectroscopic radial velocity @xmath50=+77@xmath2210 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the star has a very large motion relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "its calculated galactic orbital motion strongly suggests that it is a member of the halo , reaching heights of about 6 kpc above the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "a trigonometric parallax should be obtained to confirm the extreme value of its motion relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "although the star does not appear to be significantly metal poor , its status as a possible disk star ejected from the plane , an extreme old disk star , or a true halo star should be addressed by careful measurement of its metal abundance .",
    "that an old hydrogen burning object should be so cool as to have the spectrum of an m8.5 dwarf indicates that it must be extremely close to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "that makes a unique object among the high velocity stars .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
