    "the near - infrared ( nir ) background is @xmath91000 times brighter than the optical background when observing from the ground , severely limiting our ability to observe faint objects at these wavelengths .",
    "for example , the average dark sky brightness in the @xmath1 band is 13.7magarcsec@xmath7 ( vega system ) compared to 21.8magarcsec@xmath7 in the @xmath10 band @xcite . from nir spectra of the night sky",
    "it is known that the background is dominated by the bright emission lines associated with the vibrational decay of atmospheric hydroxyl ( oh ) molecules @xcite . complicating matters even further , the oh airglow",
    "is also known to fluctuate rapidly on short time - scales preventing clean subtraction from data @xcite .",
    "the situation is rather unfortunate given the importance of the nir window to the future of cosmology .",
    "many key ultraviolet and optical spectral signatures used to study various astrophysical phenomena , notably star formation , are redshifted into the nir window due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "thus , overcoming the oh airglow is a fundamental challenge for observational astronomy .",
    "space - based observations naturally provide a much fainter nir background . here",
    "the low background consists mainly of zodiacal scattered light and may be as low as @xmath937.5 to 55photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 in the @xmath1 band as measured from the hubble deep field - north ( ecliptic latitude @xmath11deg ) and from the hubble ultra deep field ( @xmath12deg ) using the f160w filter ( @xmath90.4@xmath2 bandwidth ) of nicmos on the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite .    in comparison ,",

    "more recently , @xcite measure 670@xmath5200photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 between 1.662 and 1.663@xmath2 using the folded - port infrared echellette ( fire ) spectrometer at magellan at @xmath14 .",

    "although the background in space is much darker when compared to the ground , the limited accessibility of space telescopes and the fact that the largest telescopes will always be on the ground drives astronomers to continue searching for ways to mitigate the oh airglow from the ground .    given that the oh lines are intrinsically narrow @xcite , a low level background from the ground may be possible through oh suppression . it has been demonstrated that the lorentzian wings of a diffraction grating line profile contribute non - negligible amounts of light from a bright emission line to the interline regions @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite claimed that the interline background in their measured @xmath1 band spectrum is consistent with just instrumentally - scattered oh emission .",
    "they compared their observed spectrum to a simulated sky spectrum generated from the oh line list of @xcite with gaussian line profiles ( @xmath15 ) convolved with the measured fire line spread function .",
    "if this is the case then suppressing the oh lines before any dispersive element should limit the amount of oh light scattered by the diffraction grating into the interline regions providing higher sensitivity observations . for example , the simulations of @xcite show that the background reduction when observing with pre - dispersion oh suppression together with adaptive optics ( ao ) versus observations with ao - only may be a factor of up to @xmath167 greater than the background reduction when observing with ao versus natural seeing .",
    "note that ao reduces the background because a smaller aperture may be used to sample the object compared to natural seeing .",
    "thus , oh suppression is as important to cosmology as ao @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite attempted to use oh suppression fibres with fibre bragg gratings ( fbgs ) designed to suppress the 103 brightest oh doublets in the @xmath1 band ( 1.471.7@xmath2 ) before dispersion to reduce the lorentzian wings and demonstrate an interline background reduction to produce higher sensitivity nir observations .",
    "fbgs are the most advanced filter - based oh suppression technique to date @xcite .",
    "they do not have line profiles with scattering wings like diffraction gratings , which is the reason they provide an advantage @xcite , in theory , over dispersion - based oh suppression techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ", the word grating refers to a refractive index modulation within the fibre core that induces fresnel reflections .",
    "the filter response of an fbg is due to interference between the forward and backward propagating waves within the fibre core , much like a standard dielectric filter @xcite .",
    "the refractive index modulation `` grating '' of an fbg does not disperse light generating line profiles with scattering wing as a diffraction grating does . in this respect , they behave identically to ordinary optical fibres .",
    "@xmath1 band spectra of the night sky taken with oh suppression fibres show that the fibres do an excellent job of suppressing the oh lines compared to a non - suppressed control spectrum taken through an ordinary fibre @xcite .",
    "however , the interline background in the oh suppressed spectrum and the non - suppressed spectrum is nearly identical @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the interline background may be dominated by contributions from unsuppressed oh lines and/or other atmospheric sources and/or astronomical sources .",
    "however , these night sky observations are detector noise - dominated in the interline regions , due to low system throughput , possibly obfuscating the expected interline background reduction .",
    "plans are in place for these observations to be repeated in a regime that is sky background - limited using the same oh suppression fibres with an optimised fibre - fed spectrograph in early 2014 @xcite .",
    "if the lack of a reduction in interline background is confirmed by these new observations , it may still be possible to achieve the desired background reduction and the associated increase in sensitivity by suppressing more lines if non - suppressed oh lines are responsible .",
    "if other atmospheric sources and/or astronomical sources are responsible , these sources may be filterable depending on whether they are line or continuum sources .",
    "understanding the nature of the interline sky background in the oh suppressed observations made with the first generation of oh suppression fibres is an essential step toward perfecting this technology .",
    "in this paper , we present the analysis of 19 hours of night sky observations in the @xmath1 band using the gnosis oh suppression unit with the iris2 imaging spectrograph @xcite at the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) . in section [ section :",

    "further which atmospheric molecules may be responsible for the atmospheric component of the ilb , we examine the linear correlation between the ilb and oh and o@xmath0 emission . for this purpose",
    ", we consider all observations of field a ( up to 27 without and 14 with a control fibre ) because the night to night variation of oh or o@xmath0 emission should simply result in a corresponding variation in the ilb if the quantities are correlated .",
    "the zsl contribution to the ilb is nearly identical in all these frames because the ecliptic latitude is nearly the same ( @xmath17@xmath18deg ) and this constant value should only affect the best - fitting intercept .",
    "the scattered moonlight contribution is small and varies by @xmath193photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 from frame to frame based on equation ( [ equation : ksmodel ] ) for both rayleigh and mie scattering .",

    "oh and o@xmath0 emission for the sky frames of field a. oh is corrected using @xmath20 while o@xmath0 and the ilb are corrected using @xmath21 as before .",
    "again , our choice of @xmath21 does not affect any of the results or conclusions .",
    "we determine the best - fitting slope and intercept , their standard errors and the coefficient of determination using linearmodelfit in mathematica .",
    "the best - fitting linear models are shown by the lines in figure [ figure : ilbvsoh ] and the fit parameters are listed in table [ table : ilboh ] .    considering the 14 of 27 sky frames of field",
    "a with a control fibre in order to make a fair comparison of all three sets of oh lines and o@xmath0 , we see a strong linear correlation between oh ( @xmath220.650 ) and a moderate correlation with o@xmath0 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this result seems to indicate that the ilb is much more oh - like than o@xmath0-like .",
    "however , the temporal behaviour of oh and o@xmath0 are very similar except very early in the night ( @xmath24hr ) .",
    "there are only two sky frames in the entire field a set with @xmath24hr and the correlation analysis does not really distinguish oh and o@xmath0 in the ilb .",
    "similarly , it is difficult to distinguish between the subtle difference in temporal behaviour between the oh vibrational transitions using correlation analysis .",
    "more data helps to distinguish these subtle differences . for 31 q and 42 , 53 ,",
    "64 oh emission , we can double the amount of data by considering all 27 sky frames of field a. doing so weakens the linear correlation , @xmath25 for 31 q and @xmath26 for 42 , 53 , 64 oh emission , but these values are similar to the correlation strengths ( @xmath27 ) reported by @xcite with a significantly larger data set .",
    "when considering all 27 sky frames of field a the ilb correlates with 31 q oh better than 42 , 53 , 64 oh , as we expected from earlier arguments about the ilb measurement region being near 20 , 31 and 96 oh vibrational transitions .",
    "we conclude that the ilb seems to be instrumentally - scattered oh emission in nature based on its airmass dependence , temporal behaviour and linear correlation with oh . this oh component may be residual from the suppressed 31 p lines as suggested by @xcite , who show that the even with oh suppression , the ilb should still be dominated by residual oh emission",
    ". alternatively , it may be instrumentally - scattered light from nearby unsuppressed oh lines , such as the 31 q lines .",
    "knowing where the instrumentally - scattered oh comes from is obviously crucial information for perfecting oh suppression fibre technology , but it is difficult to say with the present analysis which oh vibrational transitions are responsible given how similar the vibrational transitions are to each other and the fact that the ilb in the oh suppressed and control spectrum are the same @xcite . additionally , there is possibly a contribution from other atmospheric molecules that dim rapidly early in the night . beyond this",
    ", it is not possible for us to make a definite positive identification of which atmospheric molecules constitute the strong atmospheric component of the ilb .",
    "doing so will require high resolution , high sensitivity spectra of the region where the ilb is measured .",

    "now we turn our attention to non - atmospheric contributions to the ilb , specifically zsl and scattered moonlight .",
    "based on the estimates from the models shown in figures [ figure : zslmodel ] and [ figure : moonlightmodel ] , these contributions are expected to be very weak compared to the oh - like atmospheric component ( mean un - corrected measured ilb @xmath91000photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 ) . nevertheless , following works such as @xcite , we search for trends in the ilb with ecliptic latitude , lunar distance , and lunar zenith distance in an attempt to detect the presence of zsl and scattered moonlight in the ilb",
    ". we also attempt to quantify these components in the ilb by a model fitting procedure .",
    "fitting for very weak non - atmospheric components is challenging , especially given the large variability of the atmospheric component .",
    "however , the goal of oh suppression is to reduce the atmospheric background component and in future oh suppressed data , we may be able to accurately assess weaker background components by model fitting .",
    "first , we attempt to detect the contribution from zsl in our measured ilb . of the 45 sky frames in our data set , we have three sky frames taken very close to the moon ( @xmath311deg ) , which we refer to as the small @xmath29 set . judging by eye , there appears to be a significant contribution from scattered moonlight due to mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols in the small @xmath29 set and we omit it in the analysis of the zsl component .",
    "the remaining 42 sky frames all have @xmath3068deg and @xmath3180deg and we refer to these as the large @xmath29 set . according to the extrapolated @xcite model , the scattered moonlight component in the large @xmath29 set is @xmath192phtonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 ( see figure [ figure : moonlightmodel ] ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite find very weak correlations between the ilb and @xmath32 and @xmath29 in their @xmath1 band data indicating a very weak scattered moonlight component .",
    "thus , we assume that the ilb in the large @xmath29 set is essentially the strong atmospheric component and zsl .    figure [ figure : zsl42 ] shows the ilb versus @xmath33 for the large @xmath29 set . as the zsl component is quite weak compared to the atmospheric component , we correct for the airmass and time dependence of the atmospheric component by dividing the ilb by @xmath20 and @xmath34 . for @xmath34",
    ", we use the best - fitting piecewise linear model for 31 q oh emission , listed in table [ table : ohcombined ] , as this set of oh lines has the strongest correlation with the ilb for all 27 sky frames of field a. the range of @xmath35 values is not well - sampled and no obvious trend is visible . the line shows the best - fitting linear model , but the correlation is very weak ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we conclude that zsl is indeed very weak compared to the atmospheric component of the ilb in the @xmath1 band .",
    "68deg and @xmath3180deg .",
    "scattered moonlight component is very small in these frames and the ilb is mostly the atmospheric component ( likely oh ) and zsl .",
    "values are corrected for airmass and time dependence assuming an oh component . a very weak correlation ( @xmath36 ) with @xmath35",
    "is seen indicating a very weak zsl component compared to the strong atmospheric component.[figure : zsl42],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we corroborate this with a model - fitting procedure .",
    "consider the following ilb model including an oh and zsl component , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are free parameters .",
    "the oh component has been normalised to the peak value @xcite zsl model such that both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are unit - less scaling factors that may be compared directly .",
    "we use nonlinearmodelfit in mathematica to determine the best - fitting parameter values and their standard errors ( computed from the covariance matrix ) with the constraint that the parameter values be real and positive . the best - fitting ilb model to the large @xmath29 set has @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the large magnitude and standard error of the oh component are a reflection of the dominance and variability of the oh component , which renders the measurement of the zsl unreliable in this case .",
    "thus , we adopt the zsl model of @xcite and subtract the expected zsl contribution from the ilb in our analysis of scattered moonlight .",
    "68deg and @xmath3180deg .",
    "the data is separated by date : 1 sep ( circles ) , 2 sep ( triangles ) , 3 sep ( squares ) , 4 sep ( inverted triangles ) and 5 sep ( filled squares ) .",
    "ilb values are zsl - subtracted and the airmass and time dependence of the large atmospheric component is removed .",
    "ilb after moonset are consistently dark . at @xmath42deg",
    ", the ilb appears to increase with @xmath32 , which is opposite behaviour expected from equation [ equation : ksmodel ] and observations of @xcite .",
    "this trend is unlikely due to scattered moonlight and more likely due to the night to night variation of the strong atmospheric component of the ilb.[figure : ilbzmoon42],scaledwidth=47.0% ]      @xcite find very weak dependences on lunar distance ( @xmath43 ) and lunar zenith distance ( @xmath44 ) for the @xmath1 band ilb and we search for similar correlations in our data .",
    "first , we continue our study of the 42 sky frames of the large @xmath29 set .",
    "figure [ figure : ilbzmoon42 ] shows the ilb versus @xmath32 for these sky frames .",
    "the values are zsl - subtracted using equation ( [ equation : zslmodel ] ) and corrected for airmass and time dependence as before .",
    "there is no dependence on @xmath32 after moonset .",
    "there are six data points in the range @xmath45deg that are a factor of @xmath92 larger than the rest of the data points .",
    "the ilb even seems to rise towards @xmath46deg , which is opposite to the behaviour expected from equation ( [ equation : ksmodel ] ) and the trend seen in @xcite .",
    "these sky frames with the ilb value @xmath471000photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 are from 2 and 4 september 2011 . within each night",
    ", there is no dependence on @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the apparent trend is likely not due to scattered moonlight , but a combination of the small number of data points and the night to night variation of the strong atmospheric component .",
    "thus , our results are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure : ilbrhoall ] shows the ilb versus @xmath29 for the large @xmath29 set and the small @xmath29 set .",
    "the ilb values of the small @xmath29 set are zsl - subtracted but not corrected for the airmass and time dependence of the atmospheric component because the scattered moonlight component in these frames may be quite large .",
    "there is no ilb dependence on @xmath29 at large lunar distances .",
    "the curve is poorly - sampled between 15 and 60deg , but the data show some dependence on lunar distance at @xmath311deg , which is consistent with mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols . note that @xcite find a weak correlation with @xmath29 , but they do not have any data points within @xmath915deg from the moon .    equation ( [ equation : ksmodel ] ) predicts @xmath9140 , 10 and 30photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 from moonlight mie scattered by atmospheric aerosols for sky frames 7 , 8 and 32 , respectively , in the small @xmath29 set",
    ". these contributions are much too small to account for the observed ilb values assuming the only other contributions are from an oh component and zsl . to see this , consider the following ilb model for the oh and zsl components , @xmath48 where the first term is the time - dependent , airmass - dependent oh component with @xmath38 as a free parameter and the second term is the zsl model of @xcite .",
    "as before , we use nonlinearmodelfit in mathematica to determine the best - fitting @xmath38 value to the un - corrected ilb of the large @xmath29 set with the constraint that the value be real and positive . then , we use this best - fitting ilb model to estimate the oh+zsl contribution in the small @xmath29 set . to this estimate",
    ", we include a conservative uncertainty estimate of @xmath49 per cent to account for the large variability of oh .",
    "then , we estimate the scattered moonlight contribution by ilb@xmath50 .",
    "this yields a scattered moonlight contribution of at least 3500 , 580 and 880photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 for sky frames 7 , 8 and 32 , respectively .",
    "compared to the estimate from equation ( [ equation : ksmodel ] ) , the contribution from mie scattered moonlight is @xmath925 , 60 and 28 times greater than expected .",
    "this result is not too surprising , considering our estimates using equation ( [ equation : ksmodel ] ) utilise the empirically measured mie scattering function over mauna kea .",
    "differences in the aerosol composition and concentration , which is affected by factors such as industrial pollution , volcanic eruptions and sand storms , between siding spring and mauna kea could certainly account for the discrepancy between the model and observations .",
    "given its location and low altitude , siding spring is likely more susceptible to aerosol scattering making scattered moonlight a potentially more significant contributor to the nir background at this location .",
    "however , more night sky observations at smaller lunar phase angles ( @xmath5130deg ) and at low lunar distances ( @xmath330deg ) where the scattered moonlight component is comparable to the atmospheric component are necessary to firmly establish the impact aerosol scattering of moonlight on nir observations at siding spring .",
    "previously , we used the variation of the ilb measured at 1.520@xmath2 with airmass , time after sunset , ecliptic latitude , lunar zenith distance and lunar distance to determine the presence of non - thermal atmospheric emission , zsl and scattered moonlight in the ilb when using oh suppression fibres .",
    "we established that the ilb is dominated an oh - like atmospheric source .",
    "the end goal of oh suppression is to reduce the ilb for higher sensitivity observations .",
    "while the current generation of oh suppression have yet to realise this ilb reduction @xcite , we measure the absolute sky brightness of the ilb with the current observations under the darkest conditions to establish a benchmark for future oh suppressed observations .",
    "we select nine low airmass ( @xmath52 ) , middle of the night ( @xmath53hr after sunset ) and moonless ( @xmath54deg ) sky frames for this dark ilb measurement , which yields an ilb of 560@xmath5120photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 from the mean and standard deviation .",
    "our measured dark ilb is similar to the values of @xcite and @xcite at 1.665@xmath2 at @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively , without oh suppression .",
    "this suggests that the ilb in their spectra and ours is the same , hence the suppression of the 103 brightest oh lines is not affecting the ilb as modelled by @xcite and the ilb is dominated by emission from non - suppressed atmospheric emission ( oh or other ) .",
    "if this is the case , it would explain the nearly identical ilb in the oh suppressed and non - suppressed sky spectra taken with gnosis+iris2 . however , we remind the reader that these observations are detector noise - dominated and it is possible that there is an ilb reduction in our oh suppressed spectrum that we are unable to observe among the detector noise . in any case , it is difficult the form a compelling argument at this point considering we measure the ilb at a different wavelength .",
    "@xcite measure a value of 860@xmath5210photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 over the entire @xmath1 band with oh suppression using gnosis+iris2 data indicating that our ilb measurement window may be one of the darker windows in the @xmath1 band . with the current gnosis+iris2 data , we are unable to reliably measure the ilb at 1.665@xmath2 due to contamination by instrumental thermal emission and the large uncertainties associated with the removal of the thermal background .",
    "a direct comparison at 1.665@xmath2 with oh suppression fibres in a regime that is sky background - limited using an optimised and cooled spectrograph is left for future work @xcite .",

    "the 3 points at @xmath19 11deg contain a significant amount of moonlight ( @xmath47 300photons@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 ) giving a reliable estimate even amongst the large scatter in the atmospheric component of the ilb.[figure : ilbrhoall],scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "in this paper we analysed 19hr of @xmath1 band observations taken with gnosis , the first oh suppression unit to utilise oh suppression fibres with fibre bragg gratings and the iris2 spectrograph at the aat .",
    "these data include 45 night sky observations covering a range of sky positions and lunar conditions . from these data",
    ", we examined the spatial and temporal behaviours of the interline background , oh and o@xmath0 emission to determine the nature of the ilb measured at 1.520@xmath2 when using the first generation of oh suppression fibres with a @xmath4 spectrograph .",
    "this analysis is a critical step in the development of oh suppression fibre technology , which may potentially impact observational astronomy at the level of adaptive optics or greater .",
    "the region where the ilb was measured is populated exclusively by oh lines corresponding to 20 , 31 and 96 vibrational transitions and these are the most likely to directly contribute instrumentally - scattered oh into the measured ilb .",
    "thus , we studied the temporal behaviour of oh lines corresponding to 31 and 42 , 53 and 64 vibrational transitions measured in the oh suppressed and non - suppressed sky spectra when available .",
    "we found that the temporal behaviour of oh emission is best modelled by a gradual linear decrease the first half of the night followed by a gradual linear rise during the second half of the night following the behaviour of the solar elevation angle .",
    "o@xmath0 emission on the other hand , exhibits very rapid dimming after sunset .    for space - based observations ,",
    "the dominant nir background component is zodiacal scattered light .",
    "unfortunately , given the large variability of the atmospheric component in the ilb and the relative weakness of the zsl component , we were unable to reliably measure zsl in our data .",
    "we adopted the zsl model of @xcite and removed this component from the ilb where appropriate .",
    "the ilb contribution from scattered moonlight in the @xmath1 band is undetectable , except at small lunar distances ( @xmath311deg ) where mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols is very efficient .",
    "this contribution is much larger than expected from a model based on @xmath10 band measurements at mauna kea by @xcite and extrapolated to the @xmath1 band using the typical wavelength dependences for the scattering efficiency of rayleigh and mie scattering . due to its location and altitude ,",
    "siding spring is likely more susceptible to aerosol scattering by industrial pollution and sand storms compared to mauna kea .",
    "thus , the scattered moonlight contribution to the nir ilb at small lunar distance is potentially more significant at siding spring compared to other sites .",
    "we have found evidence for this , but more measurements of the night sky background near full moon and at small lunar distance are necessary to firmly establish the significance of aerosol scattering of moonlight at siding spring . otherwise , for large lunar distances ( @xmath3060deg ) and large lunar phase angles ( @xmath3180deg ) , we found no dependence on lunar distance or lunar elevation angle indicating a weak contribution from moonlight in the @xmath1 band in agreement with the results of @xcite using data from fire at magellan .",
    "although moonlight dominates the ilb at very small lunar distances the background when using oh suppression fibres is otherwise dominated by non - thermal atmospheric emission , potentially either line emission scattered by the instrument or an airglow continuum .",
    "the ilb exhibits the characteristic @xmath60 $ ] behaviour expected of emission from an atmospheric molecule when following the same field throughout the night .",
    "additionally , the temporal behaviour of the ilb is similar to that of oh and o@xmath0 with the dimming of the ilb early in the night being intermediate between the slow rate of oh and the fast rate of o@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the ilb contains atmospheric emission from multiple molecules with both slow dimming rates like oh and rapid dimming rates like o@xmath0 .",
    "there are no o@xmath0 transitions in the ilb measurement region but o@xmath0-like molecules may be responsible for the intermediate dimming rate of the ilb early in the night .",
    "there is also a strong linear correlation between the ilb and oh emission , which strengthens the case that the atmospheric component of the ilb is dominated by instrumentally - scattered oh . however , it is not possible to distinguish which lines or vibrational transitions are responsible given their similar long - term temporal behaviours .",
    "the absolute ilb at 1.520@xmath2 under dark conditions with oh suppression is 560@xmath5120photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "this value is similar to previous non - suppressed measurements and our own measurement from a control fibre suggesting that the suppression with the current grating design does not affect the ilb and it is dominated by emission from non - suppressed atmospheric emission .",
    "there is some uncertainty regarding this conclusion given that the current gnosis+iris2 observations are detector noise - dominated and the ilb comparison was made at two different wavelengths .",
    "we are currently designing an optimised and cooled fibre - fed spectrograph , called praxis , with a high performance , low noise 1.7@xmath2 cutoff hawaii-2rg detector to be used with the gnosis for further development of oh suppression fibre technology .",
    "gnosis+praxis will provide sky background - limited data with significantly reduced thermal noise @xcite . if no ilb reduction is seen in these data",
    ", then it will be clear that non - suppressed atmospheric emission is responsible for the ilb .",
    "in that case , an ilb reduction may still be possible with improved fibre design , i.e. suppressing more sky lines .",
    "for example , there is evidence that non - suppressed oh lines originally thought to be very weak are responsible for the lack of ilb reduction .",
    "this could certainly account for the observed linear correlation between the ilb and oh .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show an ilb reduction when the sky is modelled according to the oh line list of @xcite . here , only the 103 brightest",
    "oh doublets need to be suppressed because the other non - suppressed lines are so weak that they do not matter .",
    "however , the oh line list of @xcite indicates that some of the non - suppressed lines are much stronger scattering more light into the interline regions . comparing the observed gnosis+iris2 spectrum to a simulated oh suppressed spectrum using the oh line spectrum of @xcite and a simulated spectrum using an updated oh line spectrum consisting of an amalgamation of @xcite and @xcite and giving precedence to @xcite when a line occurs in both lists , indicates that the latter is a better fit to the observations .",
    "if these non - suppressed lines are stronger and responsible for the lack of ilb reduction , more accurate model of the night sky should be used to determine the number of lines that need to be suppressed to achieve the desired ilb reduction .",
    "this highlights the fact that for proper sky suppression , accurate sky line positions and strengths are critical .",
    "new measurements of the oh lines are being carried out with high resolution spectra taken with crires ( cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ) at the very large telescope ( chris lidman , private communication ) .",
    "future grating designs will incorporate these new measurements in order to optimise the performance of oh suppression fibres for deep ground - based nir spectroscopy .",

    "<S> we analyse the near - infrared interline sky background , oh and o@xmath0 emission in 19 hours of @xmath1 band observations with the gnosis oh suppression unit and the iris2 spectrograph at the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the temporal behaviour of oh emission is best described by a gradual decrease during the first half of the night followed by a gradual increase during the second half of the night following the behaviour of the solar elevation angle . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the interline background at 1.520@xmath2 where the instrumental thermal background is very low and study its variation with zenith distance , time after sunset , ecliptic latitude , lunar zenith angle and lunar distance to determine the presence of non - thermal atmospheric emission , zodiacal scattered light and scattered moonlight . </S>",

    "<S> scattered moonlight due to mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols is seen at small lunar distances ( @xmath311deg ) , but is otherwise too faint to detect . except at very small lunar distances </S>",
    "<S> the interline background at a resolving power of @xmath4 when using oh suppression fibres is dominated by a non - thermal atmospheric source with a temporal behaviour that resembles atmospheric oh emission suggesting that the interline background contains instrumentally - scattered oh </S>",
    "<S> . however , the interline background dims more rapidly than oh early in the night suggesting contributions from rapid dimming molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute interline background is 560@xmath5120photonss@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath8arcsec@xmath7 under dark conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this value is similar to previous measurements without oh suppression suggesting that non - suppressed atmospheric emission is responsible for the interline background . </S>",
    "<S> future oh suppression fibre designs may address this by the suppression of more sky lines using more accurate sky line measurements taken from high resolution spectra .    </S>",
