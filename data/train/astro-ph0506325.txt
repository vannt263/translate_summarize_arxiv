    "in the current era , discerned by the wide band x - ray spectral capability of the present day x - ray satellite observatories , the non - thermal component in the hard x - ray spectrum has emerged to be the most prominent and intriguing observational feature of the galactic black hole candidates ( see * ? ? ? * for a short review ) .",
    "various conflicting hypotheses concerning the physical mechanism of the origin of this non - thermal emission have been offered to explain the phenomenon ; ranging from synchrotron at the base of the jet @xcite to comptonization of thermal photons by a hot corona with various geometrical structures ( see , for eg .",
    "* )  the most favored being that of a hot quasi - spherical cloud inside a truncated disc @xcite . in recent times , the existence of a truncated accretion disk near black holes is establishing itself as an emerging independent paradigm , with diverse theoretical formalisms , viz .",
    "adaf @xcite and tcaf @xcite , requiring the given geometrical structure .",
    "the detection of an anti - correlated delay ( @xmath0 1000 s ) of the hard x - ray ( 2050 kev ) emission with respect to the soft x - ray ( 27 kev ) emission in the x - ray hard state of the enigmatic x - ray binary cygnus  x-3  @xcite , giving rise to the pivoting behaviour in the spectrum @xcite , adds credence to this paradigm of truncated accretion disc , with the inner region consisting of ( quasi-)spherical flow of highly energetic matter comptonizing the soft seed thermal photons from the outer disc .",
    "the time scale of this delay may be attributed to the viscous time scale of flow of matter in the radiation pressure dominated optically thick accretion disk .",
    "grs  1915 + 105  @xcite is a black hole binary system which displays the most varied types of emission states ever seen in a galactic microquasar , with the time scale of spectral variations / transitions ranging from minutes to months . among all the various classes of behavioural features exhibited by grs  1915 + 105 , in the @xmath1 state",
    "@xcite it exhibits steady x - ray emission for long durations , further characterized by a pronounced qpo feature . @xcite",
    "have examined the spectral classifications of black hole sources and have concluded that grs  1915 + 105 , in its steady states , shows characteristics closer to the thermally dominant state or low hard sates .",
    "the @xmath1 state , with its band limited power density spectrum , resembles the characteristics of the low hard state ( though the luminosity and the x - ray spectral index are slightly different from those found in other black hole sources ) . in this state",
    "the x - ray spectra display a pivoting behaviour ( for spectra obtained on different days , spanning the extent of the hard state ) , very similar to cygnus  x-3  @xcite .",
    "also , the soft x - ray flux is correlated to the radio emission in this state , with the correlation spanning across 5 orders of magnitude of intrinsic luminosity for various black hole candidates @xcite , suggesting that the soft x - ray flux is driving both the hard x - ray as well as radio emission .",
    "given the universality of the correlated behaviour of these systems , and the similarity of the spectral evolution in this state of grs  1915 + 105  with cygnus  x-3 , it was imperative that an anti - correlated delay between the hard and soft x - rays , analogous to cygnus  x-3 , be present in grs  1915 + 105 , in the @xmath1 state .    here",
    "we report the presence of such an anti - correlated time lag of the hard x - ray ( 20  50 kev ) emission to that of the soft x - ray ( 2  7 kev ) emission observed in six pointed observations by _",
    "rxte-_pca during the @xmath1 state of grs  1915 + 105 . during these particular pointings",
    "the ` in situ ' pivoting feature in the spectra is seen similar to what reported for cygnus  x-3   @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we also report a corresponding change in the quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) parameters ubiquitously present in the low hard state of this source , most notably being the shift in the centroid frequency .",
    "the pointed observations of the narrow field of view instrument pca aboard the _ rxte _ are used for the timing as well as the spectral analysis .",
    "the lightcurves for the cross - correlation tests as well as the spectra ( obtained from the pca ) use the standard 2 form of data ( all pcus added ) , with all the procedures of data filtering , background and deadtime corrections strictly adhered to .",
    "the lightcurve for the qpo analysis was obtained from the single bit mode data , covering the 27 kev band .",
    "the data reduction and analysis was carried out using ` heasoft ` ( v5.2 ) , which consists of ( chiefly ) ` ftools ` ( v5.2 ) , ` xronos ` ( v5.19 ) and ` xspec ` ( v11.2 ) .",
    "this source is extremely variable in nature and it has been classified into several variability classes @xcite .",
    "based on the rxte pointed observations carried out in 1996 - 1997 , @xcite have identified long duration steady hard states ( the ` c ' state in their nomenclature ) as the @xmath1 class .",
    "as discussed by @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , this is the closest analogue to the canonical low - hard states of galactic black hole sources , and it is in this state that the source seems to spend the most of its time .",
    "this @xmath1 state is further subdivided into 4 subclasses , @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the subclasses @xmath2 to @xmath4 are the long uninterrupted steady states whereas the @xmath3 class is a collection of isolated individual pointed observations with properties similar to @xmath2 to @xmath4 classes . since a portion of other variability classes ( like the @xmath5 class ) can look like the @xmath1 class , we have only taken the @xmath2 to @xmath4 classes for the present study .",
    "@xcite classification covers a total of 49 pointed observations from _",
    "rxte-_pca covering the early years of its operation with the source in the @xmath1 state , of these the @xmath1 ( 13 ) states consist of 30 observations ( with some long observations separated into more than one observation ids .",
    ", in the _ rxte _ data archives ) .",
    "all these observations pertaining to the @xmath1 ( 1 - 3 ) state , as per the classification covered by @xcite , was inspected for the presence of the anti - correlated lag between the hard ( 2050 kev ) and soft ( 27 kev ) emission , following the analogous results obtained for cygnus x-3 @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that the mechanism causing the change in the soft x - ray spectrum ( the accretion rate being one of the the most likely candidate ) , withthe corresponding delayed opposite change in the hard x - ray emission , is very unlikely to be a continuous process , a large number of long pointed observations are needed to serendipitously capture the occasional individual events that may have occurred during the pointings .",
    "the 30 observations ( pertaining to the @xmath1 ( 13 ) states ) are classified according to the variability exhibited by the source during the each particular pointed observation . to check for the variability we obtain the variance from a constant fit to the lightcurve ( binned to @xmath6 ) , normalized to the number of time bins ( w@xmath7 ) .",
    "the histogram giving the number of observations as a function w@xmath7 is plotted in figure [ fig1 ] , where it is clearly seen that for values of w@xmath7 @xmath8 250 there are four observations ( occurring on mjd 50441 - 42 , 50477 , 50480 , 50729 ) corresponding to the high variability cases , within the class of observations considered by us .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lagged anti - correlation of the hard x - rays ( 20 - 50 kev ) with respect to the soft x - ray ( 2 - 7 kev ) is seen in all these four cases . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "only one observation corresponds to the variability measure ( w@xmath7 ) in the range 200 - 250 , and this band we use to demarcate the boundary of high and low variability , and this observation gives a marginal detection of the anti - correlated delay .",
    "of the 25 observations corresponding to the low variability cases ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , only in one case the lagged anti - correlation is seen , in no other case there is any detection of the delay in the correlation results .",
    "the presumption behind the classification with respect to the variability was that the observations during which significant variability is seen will be the ones where noticeable features of the lagged anti - correlation can be obtained .",
    "of course this precludes the fact that the variability should be non - monotonic in nature because , firstly the continuous monotonic evolution will result in state transition , and secondly , more importantly from the observational purview , a non - monotonic evolution with a point of maxima / minima is the best feature to measure the delay in the anti - correlation .",

    "the cross - correlation is initially obtained using the ` xronos ` program ` crosscor ' , which uses the f.f.t .",
    "algorithm to compute the coefficient which is normalized by the square root of the product of number of good newbins of the concerned lightcurves , effectively this coefficient is the cross covariance of the two lightcurves . on mjd 50441 - 42 , 50477 & 50480",
    "the source was in the @xmath12 state ( also known as the radio - quiet @xmath1 state - * ? ? ? * ) , and on mjd 50729 the source was in the @xmath13 state ( the radio - loud @xmath1 state ) .",
    "we further substantiate the correlation results by performing the pearson s test as well as the spearman s rank correlation test after correcting for the delay of the hard x - ray flux for each corresponding observation , the coefficients thus obtained are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in obtaining these coefficients , we have used data corresponding to only those time stamps for which both the fluxes are present after shifting the hard x - ray lightcurve to correct for the delay . in these cases",
    "if the hard x - ray lightcurve is not compensated for the delay , the correlation coefficients obtained are as follows ; mjd 50441 - 42  pearson s = 0.09 & spearman s = 0.12 , mjd 50477  pearson s = -0.03 & spearman s = 0.02 , mjd 50480  pearson s = -0.04 & spearman s = -0.06 , mjd 50729  pearson s = -0.28 & spearman s = -0.26 . comparing these values with the coefficients obtained for the delay compensated hard x - ray lightcurves ( table [ tab1 ] )",
    "establishes that these 4 observations pertaining to the high variability cases , within the @xmath1 ( 13 ) class , do indeed exhibit this physical phenomenon of the hard x - ray emission being delayed as well as anti - correlated to the soft x - ray emission process .",
    "the relative closeness of the pearson s and spearman s rank ( anti-)correlation values in the two cases ( with and without the compensation for the delay in the hard x - rays ) on mjd 50729 is easily attributed to the fact that the lag measured in this occasion is only @xmath6 .",
    "on all these 4 days , the x - ray spectral evolution displays a pivoting pattern , during the individual pointings .",
    "the time scale of the delay in the cross - correlation gives the time scale for the spectra to harden after the softer flux decreases and/or vice - versa .",
    "the interesting feature in the spectral evolution is the difference in the pivot point on the different days , which further underlines the unique diverse variability features of this source . in the source ,",
    "the pivoting occurs around @xmath97 kev on mjd 50477 & 57480 and in the range @xmath91020 kev on mjd 50441 - 42 & 50729 ( figure [ fig3 ] , in contrast to the energy region of @xmath34 kev for observation taken on different days @xcite .",
    "@xcite & @xcite have covered a large set of observations of grs  1915 + 105   during this era , which overlaps with the @xmath1 states reported here . as reported by them ,",

    "detailed spectral analysis is out of scope of this paper and not needed as the given results are model independent , for the purpose of the spectral fit was to mimick the shape of the count spectrum in order to unfold it and not to provide any physical interpretation from the fit parameters .",

    "this program where the pds was computed by an fft algorithm and the errors were obtained by propagating the theoretical error bars of the spectra from individual intervals ( from the relevant chi - square distribution ) , while the normalization was such that the integral of the spectra gives the squared rms fractional variability ( with the white noise subtracted ) .",

    "in @xcite it was shown that the characteristics of x - ray emission in the hard state of the galactic black hole binary systems seem to possess universal features , leading to the picture of a truncated accretion disk system .",

    "cygnus  x-3 , grs  1915 + 105 , cygnus x-1 & gx 339 - 4 showed similar pivoting in x - ray spectrum , with the pivot point varying for the different sources .",
    "this pivot point was considered to be dependent on the extent of the truncation radius . in this geometrical structure ,",
    "the compton scattered x - rays originate from a region close to the compact object inside the truncated disk , giving rise to the non - thermal component in the hard x - ray regime .",
    "the extent of the accretion disk determines the amount of seed photons available for the comptonizing component . with any change in the extent of the truncation radius ( probably due to change in accretion rate )",
    "there is an opposite change in the flux of the comptonizing component in the spectrum , leading to the anti - correlation between the hard and soft x - rays .",
    "this physical picture is applicable for all the models that require a truncated disk , viz .",
    "adaf @xcite or tcaf @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a lagged anti - correlation between the hard and soft x - rays in cygnus x-3 , roughly the origins of which can be ordained to be from the inner comptonizing cloud and the thermal disk , respectively .",
    "this delay may be attributed to the viscous time scale of matter in the truncated thermal disc , which is the readjustment time scale of the disk as well as the inner comptonizing cloud . in this scenario , the soft x - ray flux changes due to any inherent accretion process ( viz",
    ". the accretion rate ) , and after a lag of the observed time scale the disk readjusts its geometrical size effecting an opposite change in the comptonizing cloud in the inner regions , and thence the non - thermal component of the spectra changes , resulting in the pivoting phenomenon .    due to the similarity of the features of the x - ray emissions of grs  1915 + 105   with that of cygnus  x-3   in the hard state",
    "we were prompted to search for analogous lagged anti - correlation of the hard x - ray emission ( 20 - 50 kev ) with respect to the soft x - ray emission ( 2 - 7 kev ) resulting in the pivoting in the spectrum .",
    "inspection of all the observations compiled by @xcite yielded 4 occasions when the pointed _",
    "rxte_-pca observations were able to catch the serendipitous events leading to the restructuring of the accretion system .",
    "the difference in the pivot point in the spectra for @xmath13 and @xmath12 ( sub)states suggest that the intrinsic accretion system grs  1915 + 105   is more complex than that of cygnus  x-3   with the broad scenario of the accretion system in the two @xmath1 ( sub)states being not exactly the same . but",
    "the short time scale evolution of the accretion system in the x - ray hard state , resulting in the readjustment in the disk structure and size , is similar for both the ( sub)states .",
    "the presence of low - frequency qpo in grs  1915 + 105   @xcite is an inherent feature of the x - ray hard state @xcite .",
    "various prescriptions exist without any general consensus as to the precise nature of this temporal characteristic .",
    "these low - frequency qpos are found to be correlated to observed phase - lag in the fourier cross - spectrum for two different channels @xcite which may arise from the compton spectrum in the inner regions of the disk @xcite .",
    "further , the centroid frequency is shown to be correlated to the spectral index ( of the sed ) in the hard @xmath1 state @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the low - frequency qpo in the @xmath13 state to originate in the region of the comptonizing cloud , while @xcite interpret the qpo as due to oscillation of the region responsible for the hard x - ray emission . arguing on a similar vein @xcite provide a two component model with a truncated thermal accretion disk with a quasi - spherical ` transition layer ' inside ( tl model ) giving rise to the hard x - ray emission as well as the qpo .",
    "the general consensus seems to converge toward the idea that a physical model for the compact corona must naturally produce oscillations on time scales of hours to days @xcite .",
    "models not conforming directly to this geometrical structures , viz .",
    "magnetic flood scenario @xcite leading to ` accretion ejection instability ' @xcite also invoke advection as a necessary element of the theoretical formalism , and the qpos are supposed to originate at inner regions of the accretion .",
    "the consistent increase in the centroid frequency of the qpo with the softening of the x - ray emission , in the small scale reported here , provides additional support as well as constraint on the physical scenario favoring a truncated disk and high energy inflow inside .",
    "this increase in frequency may indicate the decrease in truncation radius , resulting in a physically and geometrically bigger accretion disc ( rendering the increased softness of the spectrum ) .",
    "also , the decrease in the rms variability of the qpo with increasing softness may indicate the decrease in volume of the comptonizing cloud , under the assumption that the physical origin of the qpo phenomenon lies in this highly energetic matter .",
    "the discovery of the hard x - ray delay ( anti - correlated ) in the hard state of this source ( second after cygnus  x-3 ) represses the accretion models without a truncated disk .",
    "in addition to the pivoting in the spectra , the consistent increase in the qpo centroid frequency puts the observational feature on very firm footing .",
    "further search for such features in sources like cygnus x-1 and gx 339 - 4 , where the pivot point is at higher energy , 5080 kev & @xmath8300 kev , respectively , is needed to get a complete picture of the x - ray emission in the hard state .",

    "<S> here we report the detection of similar anti - correlated time lag in the superluminal jet source grs  1915 + 105 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the existence of the pivoting in the x - ray spectrum during the delayed anti - correlation and we also find that the qpo parameters change along with the spectral pivoting . </S>",
    "<S> we explore theoretical models to understand this phenomenon . </S>"
