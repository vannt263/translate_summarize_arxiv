    "at chemical potential @xmath2 , the action of qcd is complex ( see subtitle of this workshop ) . with respect to lattice simulations",
    ", this means that the standard monte carlo techniques fail . in principle , it is possible to simulate at @xmath1 and include the baryon density @xmath3 in the measured observables by a suitable re - weighting .",
    "however , in practice this is extremely tedious : the ratio of an observable at @xmath4 divided by the observable at @xmath1 is exponentially suppressed by the physical volume .",
    "hence the absolute values of the statistical contributions tend to be many orders of magnitude larger than the ratio of interest , so that tremendous statistics are required ( `` sign problem '' ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the statistical error , lattice simulations are also plagued by systematic errors .",
    "the worst source of them are artifacts due to the finite lattice spacing @xmath5 .",
    "_ improved lattice actions _ are designed to suppress these artifacts , i.e. the continuum scaling should persist to a good approximation down to a rather short correlation length in lattice units , @xmath6 , or up to rather large values of @xmath7 ( below we use lattice units , @xmath8 ) .    as a particularly bad manifestation of lattice artifacts",
    ", there is an upper bound for @xmath3 , resp . for the fermion density @xmath9 .",
    "we will show that improved actions can weaken this unphysical saturation effect .    in simulations",
    ", chiral symmetry appears to be restored already at half the pion mass ( `` onset problem '' @xcite ) .",
    "usually quenching was blamed for that , but attempts to go beyond the quenched approximation have not really helped in this respect .",
    "the glasgow group now assumes that this is an effect of low statistics , but it is also conceivable that lattice artifacts contribute to this problem . if this is true , then the use of dynamical fermions together with an improved action should help to obtain a more continuum - like chiral behavior .",
    "the extreme case of improved actions are _ perfect actions _ :",
    "they eliminate all lattice artifacts .",
    "unfortunately they tend to involve an infinite number of couplings , hence we can only apply short - ranged approximations . a perfect action is constructed by block variable renormalization group transformations ( rgts ) of the type @xmath10 } = \\int d \\bar \\psi d \\psi d u \\ e^{-s [ \\bar \\psi , \\psi , u ] } \\",
    "\\exp \\ { -t [ \\bar \\psi ' , \\bar \\psi , \\psi ' , \\psi , u',u ] \\ } \\ .\\ ] ] we start from a fine lattice with action @xmath11 $ ] , and introduce a new lattice with a @xmath12 times coarser lattice spacing , where the action is given by @xmath13 $ ] according to eq .",
    "( [ trafo ] ) .",
    "the transformation term @xmath14 relates the original lattice variables to the new ones by averaging in some way over the fine lattice sites close to a given coarse site .",
    "it has to provide the invariance of the partition functions , @xmath15 , and of the expectation values , hence of the physical contents of the theory .",
    "the choice for @xmath14 characterizes the rgt . after the rgt",
    ", the correlation length in lattice units is reduced by a factor @xmath12 , @xmath16 .",
    "assume a mass @xmath17 and an inverse temperature @xmath18 .",
    "now we start from a very fine lattice at mass @xmath19 and inverse temperature @xmath20 , and we perform @xmath21 rgts of block factor @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to the desired parameters @xmath22 . in the limit @xmath23",
    ", this method yields a perfect action at the desired finite parameters @xmath22 .",
    "in the continuum , the chemical potential can be included by the substitutions @xmath24 , @xmath25 in the quark fields , or by replacing @xmath26 in the dirac operator .",
    "it is not trivial how to apply this substitution to the naive lattice dirac operator @xmath27 . an early guess",
    ", @xmath28 does not have the correct continuum limit . instead one should use @xmath29 @xcite . also for the somewhat more complicated wilson - dirac operator , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the substitution @xmath32 works .",
    "if we want to construct a perfect action , we can use a standard action ( wilson or staggered ) on the finest lattice and incorporate @xmath0 by this rule , which we call the _",
    "standard procedure_. in coordinate space , it amounts to the substitutions @xmath33 hence @xmath0 is treated on the lattice consistently as an imaginary constant abelian gauge potential @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are `` parallel transported to @xmath37 '' , which confirms the gauge invariance of this procedure .",
    "this observation holds for all sorts of lattice actions , hence the standard procedure ( [ stapro ] ) can always be applied .",
    "we preserve this useful property also under the rgt by using the transformation term @xmath38 , \\",
    "^{n\\mu}\\bar \\psi ' ( \\vec x ' , t ' ) = e^{\\mu n t'}\\bar \\psi ' ( \\vec x ' , t ' ) , \\ ^{n\\mu } \\psi ' ( \\vec x ' , t ' ) = e^{-\\mu n t ' } \\psi ' ( \\vec x ' , t').\\ ] ] if @xmath39 $ ] , then @xmath40 $ ] , and since distances are measured after the rgt in coarse lattice units , the transportation distance to @xmath41 is divided by @xmath12 .",
    "this is compensated by substituting @xmath42 in the coarse fields .",
    "the result of the rgt is @xmath43 $ ] , and it is easy to see that this is _ identical _ to the following construction : first let @xmath44 and perform the rgt to arrive at @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "now we include @xmath0 in the blocked action again by the standard procedure ( [ stapro ] ) ( where @xmath0 is multiplied by @xmath12 due to the rescaling to the new lattice units )",
    ".    now the rgt can be iterated . in order to arrive at a chemical potential @xmath0 in the final action ,",
    "we start with @xmath46 on the finest lattice , and perform @xmath21 rgts of block factor @xmath12 , in analogy to the mass .",
    "the limit @xmath47 yields a perfect action with @xmath0 .    from the analysis of one rgt",
    "we conclude that we can switch off @xmath0 in the beginning , iterate the rgt all the way to the perfect action , and then include @xmath0 again by the procedure ( [ stapro ] ) .",
    "this leads to a perfect action at chemical potential @xmath0 @xcite .    _ the standard procedure to include @xmath0 preserves perfectness",
    ", it does not cause any lattice artifacts and it is therefore perfect itself .",
    "_ we emphasize that this result applies to any perfect action for the fully interacting quantum theory .    in practice ,",
    "such actions are hard to construct ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "what is more realistic is a _ classically perfect _ approximation , where the functional integral in eq .",
    "( [ trafo ] ) is simplified to a minimization of the exponent on the right - hand side .",
    "a number of 2d studies suggest that classically perfect actions also suppress the lattice artifacts very strongly .",
    "consideration of the transformation term shows that including @xmath0 in a classically perfect action by the procedure ( [ stapro ] ) leads again to a classically perfect action with @xmath0 .",
    "an alternative improvement program for lattice actions starts from a standard action and tries to eliminate the artifacts order by order in the lattice spacing ( _ symanzik s program _ ) .",
    "assume that this is realized to some order at @xmath1 , improvement of qcd with wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "however , going beyond that is not realistic in the foreseeable future . ] and we include @xmath0 once more by the standard procedure .",
    "the above properties suggest that we obtain an action with @xmath0 , which is still free of lattice artifacts to the same order as it was the case at @xmath1 .",
    "a perfect lattice action for free fermions with mass @xmath17 at @xmath1 reads @xcite @xmath48 = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi } \\frac{d^{4}p}{(2\\pi ) ^{4 } } \\bar \\psi ( -p ) \\delta^{-1}(p ) \\psi ( p ) \\",
    ", \\quad \\delta ( p ) = \\sum_{l \\in { z \\!\\!\\ ! z}^{4 } } \\frac{\\prod_{\\sigma = 1}^{d } \\hat p_{\\sigma}^{2}/(p_{\\sigma}+2\\pi l_{\\sigma})^{2 } } { i \\gamma_{\\nu}(p_{\\nu}+2\\pi l_{\\nu})+m } + \\frac{1}{\\alpha } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a free rgt parameter . at @xmath50",
    "the action is chirally symmetric but non - local . for any finite @xmath49",
    "the action is local : its couplings in coordinate space decay exponentially .",
    "since the limit @xmath47 relates the system directly to the continuum , there is still chiral symmetry _ in the observables _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the action itself also keeps a remnant continuous chiral symmetry @xcite .    for applications ,",
    "it is important to optimize the locality , so that the truncation of the couplings is not too harmful .",
    "this is achieved by choosing  @xmath51 @xcite .    according to section 2 ,",
    "the corresponding perfect action at finite @xmath0 is characterize by @xmath52 .",
    "a successful and yet applicable approximation is a truncation to the couplings in a unit hypercube by means of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the corresponding couplings at @xmath1 for various masses are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rgt used for the above perfect action for wilson - type fermions is based on the usual block average ( ba ) scheme . if one constructs the analogous perfect action for staggered fermions @xcite , then the truncation to the same number of degrees of freedom as before ( couplings distance components @xmath53 resp .",
    "@xmath54 at @xmath55 ) is not satisfactory .",
    "the locality  and hence the quality after truncation  can be improved significantly by using instead a blocking scheme that we call `` partial decimation '' ( pd ) @xcite .",
    "we now focus on @xmath55 and temperature @xmath56 .",
    "the pressure and baryon density of the free fermion gas are given by @xmath57 for comparison , we insert a number of lattice fermion propagators @xmath58 . for wilson - type fermions ,",
    "we probe the wilson fermion with wilson parameter @xmath59 , a symanzik improved version thereof called d234 with additional couplings on the axes @xcite , and the truncated perfect _",
    "`` hypercube fermion '' _ ( hf ) . for staggered fermions",
    "we insert the staggered standard action , the naik fermion @xcite ( which is symanzik improved in the same way as the d234 fermion ) , and again the truncated perfect actions for the ba and the pd scheme .",
    "1 shows the scaling ratios @xmath60 and @xmath61 for this set of fermions .",
    "of course , they all reproduce the correct continuum values at @xmath62 . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the standard actions deviate very soon , the symanzik improved actions do well up to a certain @xmath0 and then collapse completely , but the truncated perfect actions keep close to the continuum value up to remarkably large @xmath0 .",
    "their scaling region is extended by one order of magnitude compared to the standard actions .",
    "one could also consider @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the baryon number susceptibility , but in all these cases the qualitative behavior is very similar , and it is also in agreement with the scaling of @xmath65 at @xmath1 @xcite , hence it is manifestly systematic .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we also show these curves for various types of staggered fermions .",
    "the standard bound is 8 , but if couplings over temporal distance @xmath66 are involved , then this bound is amplified by a factor of 3 .",
    "here we also show some symanzik improved actions with diagonal couplings from ref .",
    "one type called p4 has maximal temporal coupling distance 2 and saturates at @xmath67 , the others couple over distance 3 like the truncated perfect fermions . also here",
    "the saturation is delayed , and we mention that especially the p6 action is doing very well in the scaling tests too .",
    "a number of _ generalizations _ are straightforward , for instance the steps to finite temperature and finite mass . the latter has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for naive fermions , and the behavior is similar in all other cases : the saturation is delayed as @xmath17 grows , but the upper bound is not affected .",
    "it is fashionable to use anisotropic lattices in thermodynamic simulations . in particular",
    ", @xmath68 is useful , because it provides a better resolution of a decay in the temporal direction . remarkably , the couplings in a perfect action are independent of @xmath69 .",
    "this property still holds after truncation by periodic boundary conditions . in the previous plots",
    ", we would reproduce the same curves , and the horizontal axes now means @xmath70 .",
    "however , the lattice units are defined by @xmath71 , so @xmath0 is multiplied by @xmath69 .",
    "so far , @xmath0 has only been included in standard lattice actions . we have seen how to do this in general . of interest",
    "are applications to improved actions , and there the improved quality ( perfectness , classical perfectness , or symanzik improvement to some order ) is preserved under the inclusion of @xmath0 .",
    "applicable truncated perfect actions extend the scaling region of a free fermion gas by one order of magnitude , which suggests that simulations with them can be carried out on very coarse lattices .",
    "this is not a direct remedy of the sign problem mentioned in the introduction ( because that is a problem of statistics , whereas the improved action cures systematic errors ) , but it helps indirectly , because larger physical volumes can be handled .    for the fermion - gauge couplings and for the pure gauge part",
    ", there is much work going on to construct symanzik improved or approximately perfect actions @xcite .",
    "if this is achieved at @xmath1 , then the extension to @xmath2 is solved by the prescription shown here .",
