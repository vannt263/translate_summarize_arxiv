    "bethe s seminal solution to the isotropic heisenberg model under the periodic boundary condition @xcite in 1931 is one of the prototypical theories on the quantum integrable systems .",
    "basic procedure of the algebraic bethe ansatz is as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "first , we solve the set of algebraic equations called the bethe ansatz equations ( see equation ( [ eq : bethe_ansatz ] ) in the main text ) .",
    "next , by using the solutions to the bethe ansatz equations , we construct eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( see equation ( [ eq : bethe_vector ] ) ) .",
    "the main problem which we will consider in the present paper is to show that the whole procedure involved in the bethe ansatz method is mathematically well - defined .",
    "we pursue the problem in the same setting as was treated by bethe .    for a long time",
    "it has been observed that there are several subtle points about the procedure .",
    "one of such obstructions is the problem called the singular solutions ( see equation ( [ eq : general_singular_solution ] ) ) .",
    "recently we have much progress on this issue ( see @xcite ) and now we attain fairly good understanding of the problem . however , the very structure of the solutions to the bethe ansatz equations itself still remains in rather foggy situation .    in the analysis of the solutions to the bethe ansatz equations ,",
    "it has been customary to assume that roots of the solutions take a particular form called the strings .",
    "this idea was already apparent in the original bethe s paper .",
    "however , as we will explain shortly after , the notion  string \" has rather elusive nature and for a long time it has been a difficult problem to understand how to utilize the string structure in a proper manner .",
    "one of the well - known attempts on this problem is takahashi s theory @xcite .",
    "let us explain in more detail .",
    "let @xmath1 be the length of the spin chain and let @xmath2 be the number of down spins . then a main assumption in the derivation of takahashi s quantum number is to suppose that the strings take exactly the following form : ) allows to guess some explicit expressions for @xmath3-weight multiplicities ( kostka  foulkas polynomials ) appearing in the representation theory of lie algebras of type @xmath4 .",
    "all these formulas have been proven rigorously in @xcite and lead to applications in combinatorics , representation theory and discrete integrable systems . ]",
    "@xmath5    however , when @xmath6 , the assumption ( [ eq : string ] ) has serious difficulty . indeed , as we can easily see in examples , the real part @xmath7 as well as the intervals between successive roots are not unique if the lengths of the strings are larger than 2 . as the result ,",
    "takahashi s quantum numbers are not uniquely defined and also they are not half - integers . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we proposed to seek an alternative to takahashi s quantum numbers .",
    "in particular , in that paper we showed that the correct quantum number for the exceptional real solution @xcite is different from the one derived by takahashi s quantum numbers .    in the present paper ,",
    "as a continuation of a previous work @xcite , we propose a method to assign quantum numbers to strings of roots .",
    "for this purpose , we start from the so - called bethe s quantum numbers ( see section [ sec : bethe ] ) . here , roughly speaking , bethe s quantum numbers appear as phase factors after taking logarithm of the bethe ansatz equations . by definition , bethe s quantum numbers are uniquely defined and exactly integers or half - integers .",
    "then our basic observation is that the _ sum of bethe s quantum numbers _ associated with all roots of a given string behaves in a particularly simple manner .",
    "this is a remarkable property since individual bethe s quantum numbers behave in a rather complicated way .",
    "based on this observation we propose a method to determine complete set of the quantum numbers , which we call the rigged configurations , from bethe s quantum numbers .",
    "we confirmed these observations for all solutions of @xmath8 case by using the numerical data given in @xcite .",
    "as we noted previously , we do not have thorough understanding of the string pattern which appear in the solutions to the bethe ansatz equations . however , our main aim in the present paper is to propose a method which could be made mathematically rigorous once we obtain sound understanding of the string structure .",
    "our expectation relies on the fact that bethe s numbers are uniquely defined and exactly half - integers .    to our best knowledge ,",
    "bethe s quantum numbers had been introduced and studied in the original paper by bethe @xcite , formulas ( 37a ) and ( 37b ) , and has been studied more recently in @xcite in their study of the set of real solutions to the bethe ansatz equations for @xmath9 , and in @xcite concerning the deviation of solutions to the bethe ansatz equations from having exact string structure with numerical evidence for @xmath10 .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in section [ sec : aba ] , we provide necessary facts about the bethe ansatz method and the rigged configurations . in section [ sec : bethe ] we collect necessary facts about bethe s quantum numbers . in section [ sec : main ] we provide the main algorithm .",
    "we provide examples in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] . besides the main article , there are supplementary tables ( see remarks after conjecture [ conj : main ] ) . whereas their paper considers the case @xmath9 exclusively .",
    "note that by a result of @xcite the real part  @xmath7 \" of the string ( [ eq : string ] ) is uniquely defined when @xmath9 ( except for the exceptional real solutions ) . ]",
    "in this section we briefly overview some basic facts concerning the spin-1/2 isotropic heisenberg model , also known as the xxx model .",
    "the space of states of the spin-1/2 xxx chain of length @xmath1 is the complex space @xmath11 , which one can identify with the tensor product of @xmath1 copies of @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 the hamiltonian describing the interaction of particles has the form @xmath14 where we assume @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17stand for the pauli matrices , and @xmath18 let us introduce the vectors @xmath19 and the global vacuum ( ground state ) as @xmath20    let us consider the local transfer matrix @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and consider the monodromy matrix @xmath23 recall that the local transfer matrices satisfy the relation @xmath24 for some matrix @xmath25 where @xmath26 satisfies the quantum yang ",
    "baxter equation @xmath27 the quantum yang ",
    "baxter equation ( [ eq : ybe ] ) implies that the transfer matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the auxiliary space ) commute for different values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as a consequence of the relation ( [ eq : ybe ] ) , we can deduce that @xmath33=0 $ ] for different values of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the key observation due to bethe , reformulated in the language of the algebraic bethe ansatz , is that the vector @xmath34 is an eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath35 if and only if the parameters @xmath36 satisfy the following system of algebraic equations , known as the bethe ansatz equations ( @xmath37 for short ) @xmath38    we are interested in the so - called physical solutions to @xmath37 .",
    "the set of physical solutions is divided into the regular solutions , that is , the solutions @xmath39 which do not contain a pair @xmath40 , and the set of physical singular solutions of the form @xmath41 in the case of the regular solutions , one has @xmath42 however for singular solutions , the energy @xmath43 is not defined .",
    "it was suggested to ",
    "resolve \" singularity of @xmath43 by using a deformed form of singular solutions , namely , @xmath44 and consider the limit @xmath45 it was conjecture by @xcite , that @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 and @xmath48 we call the singular solutions which satisfy the condition ( [ eq : nwcondition ] ) the physical singular solution . the corresponding energy is @xcite @xmath49 it is also conjectured @xcite that the set of physical singular and regular solutions to @xmath37 exhausts the set of all physical solutions to @xmath37 .    finally , let us define the rigged configurations . the rigged configurations @xmath50 are comprised of a partition @xmath51 , called the configuration , and a sequence of non - negative integers @xmath52 , called the riggings , satisfying the following condition . define the vacancy number @xmath53 by the following formula @xmath54 where @xmath55 represent components of the transposed partition @xmath56 .",
    "if we regard the rigged configuration as the set of pairs @xmath57 , then the riggings must satisfy @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "we note that in the rigged configuration theory , the order of the riggings associated with rows of the configuration @xmath60 with the same length is not essential .",
    "therefore if we have the subset @xmath61 within @xmath50 , we assume that @xmath62 to erase ambiguity .    in our earlier paper",
    "@xcite we conjectured that there is a one to one correspondence between the set of physical solutions to @xmath37 and the set of the rigged configurations @xmath50 where the young diagrams representing the partitions @xmath60 have @xmath2 cells .",
    "let us define the flip operator on the set of physical solutions to @xmath37 as follows @xmath63 then another conjecture in @xcite states that the corresponding rigged configuration are connected by the following operation on the rigged configuration @xmath50 .",
    "namely , we replace each element @xmath64 by @xmath65 and reorder the riggings if necessary .",
    "this property is useful in the following discussion .",
    "in what follows , we use function @xmath66 , defined as an analytic continuation of the function @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) to all complex plane with branch cuts @xmath70 and @xmath71 along with the imaginary axis .",
    "for example , @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "if we go across the branch cuts , we have @xmath75 for @xmath74 and @xmath76 .",
    "we use the following formula @xmath77 we verify the formula as follows .",
    "we see that the differentiations of the both sides give @xmath78 . in order to determine the remaining constant ,",
    "we compare the values of the both sides at @xmath79 as follows ; @xmath80      first let us consider a regular solution . by using the formula ( [ eq : arctan ] ) ,",
    "we take the logarithm of the bethe ansatz equations ( [ eq : bethe_ansatz ] ) ; @xmath81\\\\ & = -n\\cdot 2i{\\operatorname{arctan}}(2\\lambda_k ) + \\sum^\\ell_{j=1\\atop j\\neq k } 2i{\\operatorname{arctan}}(\\lambda_k-\\lambda_j ) + ( -n+\\ell-1)\\pi i+2n\\pi i \\quad ( n\\in\\mathbb{z}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the bethe ansatz equations , this should coincide with @xmath82 for @xmath83 . writing @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 we call the half integers @xmath86 the * bethe s quantum numbers*.    here we describe the basic property of the bethe s quantum numbers in relation with the multiplication by @xmath87 .",
    "suppose that we have the following two solutions of the bethe ansatz equations @xmath88 let @xmath89 ( resp .",
    "@xmath90 ) be the bethe s quantum number corresponding to @xmath91 ( resp .",
    "@xmath92 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath93 .    since @xmath94",
    ", we obtain the result by ( [ eq : bethe ] ) .",
    "now let us consider the singular solution ( [ eq : general_singular_solution ] ) when @xmath1 is even .",
    "the computation for @xmath86 ( @xmath95 ) is same with the previous case .",
    "for the computations of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we should be reminded that the function @xmath66 has the logarithmic singularities at @xmath98 . recall that we assume @xmath99 in ( [ eq : regularization_of_nepomechie ] ) .",
    "we introduce the deformation of singular solutions @xmath100 where @xmath101 and study the limits of @xmath102,\\\\ b_2(\\theta ) & = \\frac{n}{2\\pi } \\left [ 2{\\operatorname{arctan}}(2\\lambda_2(\\theta))-\\frac{2}{n}{\\operatorname{arctan}}(\\lambda_2(\\theta)-\\lambda_1(\\theta ) ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath103 . as a result",
    "we obtain the bethe numbers @xmath104 and @xmath105 which depend on the choice of @xmath106 .",
    "the following two graphs show @xmath104 ( left ) and @xmath105 ( right ) for the solution @xmath107 of @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the sum @xmath108 is constant for @xmath109 .",
    "we start from a given physical solution @xmath110 to the bethe ansatz equations . we divide @xmath31 into subsets called strings . here",

    "we take a component of the solution @xmath31 to the bethe ansatz equations with maximal imaginary part and starting from that component we form a string of maximal length .",
    "to proceed , we erase the string created , and apply the above procedure for the remaining components of the solution @xmath31 . as a result we partition all component of the solution @xmath31 into a collection of distinct strings .",

    "let us think about solutions of @xmath8 which contain a 1-string and a 5-string .",
