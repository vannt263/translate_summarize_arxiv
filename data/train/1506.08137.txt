    "the third - order nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath0 named these days the benjamin  bona  mahony ( bbm ) equation , appeared in  @xcite as an alternative to the korteweg  de vries equation , @xmath1 , model for the unidirectional propagation of moderately long waves with small but finite amplitude in systems that manifest nonlinear and dispersive effects .",
    "numerical studies showed that the bbm equation admits soliton solutions whose interaction is inelastic though close to elastic  @xcite .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite for the equivalent form @xmath2 of the bbm equation that it has no conserved quantity in addition to those found by benjamin , bona and mahony : @xmath3 ( mass ) , @xmath4 ( energy ) , and @xmath5 ( momentum ) .",
    "lie symmetries and the corresponding reductions of the bbm equation in the above equivalent form were obtained in  @xcite ( these results were also presented in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pp 194196 ) ) .",
    "it was found that the maximal lie symmetry algebra of this equation is a  three - dimensional lie algebra of the type @xmath6 spanned by the vector fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9    there are several recent works ( see   and references therein ) devoted to the study of lie symmetries of variable - coefficient bbm equations of the general form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary smooth functions of the variable @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "however none of these works contains exhaustive and completely correct results .",
    "we aim to fill up this gap by presenting the exhaustive group classification of equations from class   and classifying local conservation laws of these equations .    in order to study transformational properties of class  , in section  2",
    "we describe the entire set of its admissible transformations ( i.e. , the equivalence groupoid of this class ) by proving that the class is normalized in the usual sense .",
    "the assertions concerning reducibility of variable - coefficient bbm equations to their constant - coefficient counterparts are presented therein .",
    "the complete classification of lie symmetries is obtained in section  3 under gauging the arbitrary element  @xmath12 to  1 by a parameterized family of point transformations related to the associated equivalence group .",
    "the method of mapping between classes is utilized in section  4 to verify the classification results . as by - product of this approach the complete group classification of a  related class of variable - coefficient bbm equations with forcing term , @xmath16 , is derived . in section  5",
    "we construct local conservation laws of equations from the class  .",
    "two differential equations which are connected by a point transformation are called _ similar _",
    "similar differential equations have similar sets of solutions , symmetries , conservation laws and other related objects .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to study point transformations linking equations from a given class of differential equations .",
    "such transformations are called form - preserving   or allowed  @xcite .",
    "the rigorous reformulation of this notion leads to the notions of admissible transformations  @xcite and the equivalence groupoid of the class .",
    "an admissible transformation is a triple that consists of two similar equations from the class and a  point transformation between them .",
    "the set of admissible transformations of the class possesses the groupoid structure with respect to the natural operation of the composition of admissible transformations and hence it is called the _ equivalence groupoid _ of the class .    a joint transformation of the unknown functions and the arbitrary elements is called an equivalence transformation of the class if it satisfies the following properties : ( _ i _ ) the transformation becomes point with respect to the independent and the dependent variables when the arbitrary elements are fixed .",
    "( _ ii _ ) it is consistent with the contact structure of the underlying jet space .",
    "( _ iii _ ) it maps any equation from the class to an equation from the same class . depending on additional restrictions , one have different kinds of equivalence transformations ( usual , generalized , extended and generalized extended ones ) .",
    "equivalence transformations of the same kind constitute a group , which is called the equivalence group of the class ( of the respective kind ) , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "if the equivalence groupoid of the class is generated by the equivalence group of this class , then this class is called _ normalized _ in the same sense as the kind of the equivalence group involved  @xcite .",
    "one - parameter subgroups of the equivalence group can be found by the lie infinitesimal method , whereas the direct method   allows one to construct the entire equivalence group including discrete equivalence transformations and this technique is preferable .",
    "the direct method can also be used for finding the equivalence groupoid and checking whether the class is normalized .",
    "a very useful feature of normalized classes is that the equivalence groups for their subclasses , singled out by setting additional constraints on arbitrary elements , are subgroups of the equivalence group of the entire class .",
    "we use this property to derive the equivalence group of the class   from the equivalence group of a normalized superclass .    consider the class of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional partial differential equations of order @xmath17 with fixed @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the set of all derivatives of @xmath3 up to order @xmath22 including @xmath3 as the zero - order derivative .",
    "the function @xmath23 is an arbitrary smooth function of its arguments .",
    "the following assertion was proven in  .    a point transformation @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , maps a fixed equation from class   to an equation from the same class if and only if it satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",

    "the usual equivalence group of class   with any fixed @xmath39 and @xmath40 consists of the transformations whose projections to the space of  @xmath41 coincides with that described in theorem  1 .",
    "moreover , this class is normalized in the usual sense .",
    "therefore , theorem  1 provides the complete description of admissible ( form - preserving ) transformations in class  .",
    "as this class is normalized , we can use transformation constraints from theorem  1 for describing admissible transformations in subclasses of this class , in particular in class .    for class",
    "we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which corresponds to case  @xmath44 of theorem  1 .",
    "now we directly seek for all point transformations of the general form @xmath45 with @xmath46 that map a fixed equation of the form   to an equation from the same class , @xmath47 the components of the prolongation of transformation   to the involved partial derivatives are @xmath48 using these expressions , we rewrite equation   in the old variables , which are without tildes",
    ". then we substitute @xmath49 into the obtained equation in order to confine it to the manifold defined by   in the third - order jet space with the independent variables @xmath50 and the dependent variable  @xmath3 .",
    "splitting the resulting identity with respect to the derivatives @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 leads to the determining equations on the transformation components  @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and  @xmath57 , @xmath58 the equations @xmath59 imply the representation @xmath60 , where  @xmath61 and  @xmath62 are smooth functions of their arguments with @xmath63 we substitute this representation for  @xmath57 into the remaining determining equations and further split with respect to @xmath3 . as a result",
    ", we get the equations @xmath64",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 we solve the equations for @xmath56 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and substitute the obtained expressions into the equations representing transformation components for arbitrary elements , which leads to the following assertion .",
    "the usual equivalence group  @xmath68 of class   is comprised of the transformations @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , are arbitrary constants with @xmath72 and @xmath28 is an arbitrary smooth function with @xmath73 class   is normalized in the usual sense .",
    "thus , each point transformation between equations from class   is induced by an element of the group  . in order to find which variable - coefficient equations of the form",
    "admit constant - coefficient counterparts , we assume that the transformed arbitrary elements  @xmath74 , @xmath75 and  @xmath76 are constants in equivalence transformations .",
    "this results in the following assertion :    a variable - coefficient equation from class   is reduced to a constant - coefficient equation from the same class by a point transformation if and only if the corresponding coefficients @xmath77 @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy the conditions @xmath78 i.e. , @xmath13 is a constant and @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "equivalence transformations allow us to simplify the consideration by reducing the number of arbitrary elements .",
    "for example , we can set the gauge @xmath79 using the family of point transformations @xmath80 parameterized by the arbitrary element  @xmath12 and related to equivalence transformations from the group  @xmath68 .",
    "then the other arbitrary elements are @xmath81 and @xmath82 . here and below an integral with respect to @xmath14",
    "should be interpreted as a fixed antiderivative .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality we can restrict ourselves by the study of the class @xmath83 as all results on symmetries and exact solutions for equations of the form   can be recovered from the corresponding results obtained for equations of the form   using the above family of point transformations .",
    "since class   is normalized , the equivalence group of its subclass   can be easily found as the subgroup of the group  @xmath68 whose elements preserve the gauge  @xmath79 .",
    "class   is normalized in the usual sense .",
    "its usual equivalence group  @xmath84 is constituted by the transformations @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 are arbitrary constants with @xmath72 .",
    "there are no truly variable - coefficient equations in class   that are reduced by point transformations to constant - coefficient equations from the same class .    in the next section we use the equivalence transformations in the course of group classification of classes   and  .",
    "we carry out the group classification of class   within the framework of the classical lie approach  @xcite .",
    "we look for vector fields of the form @xmath88 which generate one - parameter groups of point - symmetry transformations of an equation from class   and hence jointly constitute the maximal lie invariance algebra  @xmath89 of this equation .",
    "any such vector field ,  @xmath90 , satisfies the infinitesimal invariance criterion , i.e. , the action of the third prolongation ,  @xmath91 , of the vector field  @xmath90 on equation   results in the conditions being an identity for all solutions of this equation .",
    "that is , the criterion is read as @xmath92\\big|_{u_{xxt}=-(u_t+f(t)u_x+uu_x)/h(t)}=0 .",

    "hence these coefficients are equal to zero , which gives the determining equations on remaining arbitrarinesses in the components  @xmath98 , @xmath99 and  @xmath100 of the vector field  @xmath90 . solving the simplest of these equations",
    "we get the general form of the components of a lie symmetry operator of an equation from class  , @xmath101 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 being arbitrary constants .",

    "for example , there are two cases in the classification list derived in   with the three - dimensional maximal lie symmetry algebras ( cases  4 and  10 of table  1 therein )",
    ". these cases are particular subcases of case  5 of table  2 for @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "the results of section  [ sectiononclsofvcbbmeqs ] on conservation laws are quite expectable and , at the same time , are not trivial .",
    "they naturally generalize well - known results of constant - coefficient bbm equations and need the completion of the most significant and tricky part of the proof , which is deriving an upper bound for order of conservation laws similarly to @xcite .",
