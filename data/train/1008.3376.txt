    "in physics , in many situations , the study of a system passes through three stages .",
    "first , one finds a solution that emulates the system itself .",
    "second , in turn , through the solution one studies the peculiarities that the system might have .",
    "third , one performs a stability analysis on the solution to gather whether the system can be realistic or not .",
    "traversable wormhole physics is not different . throughout its development",
    ", traversable wormhole physics has complied to this bookkeeping .",
    "the field of traversable wormhole physics has been systematized by visser in his book `` lorentzian wormholes : from einstein to hawking '' @xcite .",
    "the three stages of wormhole study are in one form or another in the book .",
    "for instance , not only it displays several solutions as it also shows how simple wormhole construction can be in the paper .",
    "in addition , the book emphasizes that one of the most important properties of traversable wormhole physics is that , within general relativity , its constitutive matter must possess one kind or another of exotic properties .",
    "indeed , as the wormhole geometry , with a throat and two mouths , acts as tunnels from one region of spacetime to another , its constitutive matter possesses the peculiar property that its stress - energy tensor violates at least the null energy condition , i.e. , its matter must be exotic .",
    "in general , the known classical fields obey the null energy condition but quantum fields in very special circumstances may not obey it .",
    "since the circumstances in which the null energy condition is not obeyed are very restricted , the creation of these exotic fields for wormhole building is a difficult task . in this setting",
    "it is thus important to minimize the usage of exotic fields by finding conditions on the wormhole geometries which can contain arbitrarily small quantities of matter violating the averaged null energy condition .",
    "this has been clearly explained in visser s book @xcite and pursued further later @xcite . finally , stability analysis , perhaps the most difficult stage of all ,",
    "is also studied , though timidly , in the book @xcite .",
    "the wormhole solutions that appeared previously have been put into a wider context through the book @xcite , which in turn helped to inspire developing the field still further as can be seen by the great many number of solutions dealing with wormhole physics and geometry that have appeared since . a methodical way of organizing now this field is by dividing wormhole solutions into three classes : i. wormholes generated by continuous fundamental fields with exotic properties ; ii .",
    "wormholes generated from matching an interior exotic solution to an exterior vacuum , at a junction surface , ( just like one does with relativistic stars ) ; and iii .",
    "wormholes generated from exotic thin shells .",
    "class i could be thought of as nature given , of cosmological origin .",
    "classes ii and iii , instead , should be built by cosmic engineers , first by providing the exotic matter , then building the wormhole itself and lastly joining it smoothly into the cosmic vacuum .",
    "class iii is the most simple to construct theoretically , and perhaps also practically .    in relation",
    "to class i ( wormholes from continuous fundamental fields ) it is striking that the first wormhole solutions are indeed of this class @xcite .",
    "ellis @xcite discussed a wormhole solution , which he called a drainhole , as a model for a particle in general relativity in which an exotic continuous scalar field through spacetime provides the means to open up the throat and mouths of the wormhole .",
    "bronnikov @xcite found a general class of solutions within scalar - tensor theories , among which he managed to glimpse solutions with a neck , as he called it , i.e. , wormhole solutions . in the same vein ,",
    "kodama @xcite studied a wormhole solution , which he called a kink , with an exotic continuous scalar field being the necessary field to maintain an einstein - rosen bridge open .",
    "many other wormholes , whose subsistence hinges on some or another form of exotic matter put into the model or on the introduction of interactions of a new type which in turn mimic the exotic matter itself , have been discussed with profusion .",
    "one can name a few of those solutions : wormholes in a cosmological constant scenario , wormhole solutions in semiclassical gravity , wormhole solutions in brans - dicke theory , wormholes on the brane , wormholes supported by matter with an exotic equation of state such as phantom energy and tachyon matter , wormholes in nonlinear electrodynamics , wormholes in nonminimal einstein  yang - mills matter originating a wu - yang magnetic wormhole , wormholes with nonminimal and ghostlike scalar field and nonminimal matter @xcite . in this setting , cylindrical wormholes , which permit two definitions of the throat ( one of them allowing non - violation of the energy conditions ) , with several classes of fields such as scalar , spinor , maxwell , and nonlinear electric fields have also been studied @xcite .",
    "stability is always a hard issue and only some of these systems have had their stability analyzed , see @xcite as well as some of the works in @xcite where for instance the stability of the ellis wormhole is studied .    in relation to class ii ( wormholes generated from matching an interior exotic solution to an exterior vacuum at a junction surface ) there are many interesting works .",
    "morris and thorne @xcite created the idea that an arbitrarily advanced civilization could construct wormholes and traverse them to and fro , initiating thus the systematic study of traversable wormholes , later organized in a coherent whole in @xcite . in morris and thorne s work @xcite a finite quantity of exotic matter was used in wormhole building .",
    "this matter was then to be carefully matched to the environment . in theory",
    "this matching is done through the junction conditions . in practice",
    ", it certainly can be tricky .",
    "morris@xmath1-thorne type of wormholes were later generalized to include a positive or negative cosmological constant in @xcite , where a review of wormhole solutions was also taken , and it was suggested that perhaps one should call a civilization that constructs wormholes an absurdly advanced civilization rather than an arbitrarily advanced civilization .",
    "other wormhole solutions generated from matching an interior exotic solution to a vacuum , as well as their exotic matter properties , have been studied .",
    "namely , other wormholes in spacetimes with a cosmological constant , wormholes on the brane , wormholes made of phantom energy , wormholes with a generalized chaplygin gas , van der waals quintessence wormholes @xcite . for some study of stability of wormholes within this class see @xcite .    in relation to class",
    "iii ( wormholes generated from exotic thin shells ) many solutions have also been studied .",
    "since thin shells need less matter , the construction of wormholes from thin shells gives an elegant way of minimizing the usage of exotic matter .",
    "the exotic matter is concentrated at a shell at the wormhole throat alone , yielding a thin shell wormhole solution . in this limiting case of a thin shell ,",
    "the throat and the two mouths are all at the same location , they are indistinguishable .",
    "this concentration of the entire content of exotic matter at the shell throat of the wormhole is provided by the cut - and - paste technique used for the first time in relation to wormholes in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although morris and thorne @xcite had used before heuristic methods in such a construction .",
    "thin - shell wormholes in a cosmological constant background , wormhole with surface stresses on a thin shell , plane symmetric thin shell wormholes with a negative cosmological constant , cylindrical thin - shell wormholes , charged thin - shell lorentzian wormholes in a dilaton - gravity theory , five dimensional thin - shell wormholes in einstein - maxwell theory with a gauss - bonnet term , solutions in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell theory , thin - shell wormholes associated with global cosmic strings , wormhole solutions in heterotic string theory , a new type of thin - shell wormhole by matching two tidal charged black hole solutions localized on a three brane in the five dimensional randall - sundrum gravity scenario , thin shell and other wormholes within pure gauss - bonnet gravity which can be built without the need of using exotic matter ( the gravity itself being already exotic ) , spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes in a string cloud background spacetime , and many other solutions have been discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "now , in relation to stability , these thin - shell wormholes are extremely useful as one may consider a linearized stability analysis around the static solution . in the end",
    ", the stability analysis will tell whether the throat can be kept open or not , i.e. , whether the static solution holds under small perturbations . within general relativity",
    "this has been done for several thin - shell wormhole systems , namely , four - dimensional spherical symmetric systems in vacuum @xcite , with a cosmological constant @xcite , and with electric charge @xcite , planar systems with a cosmological constant @xcite , and @xmath0-dimensional spherical symmetric systems with electric charge @xcite . also for stability analyses with dilaton , axion , phantom and other types of matter , and in cylindrical symmetry see @xcite .",
    "this method does not require a specific equation of state , although it can be added to the analysis as was done in some works previously cited .",
    "one can also apply other techniques like a dynamic stability analysis to these thin - shell wormholes @xcite .      in this work",
    "we want to extend further the study of class iii wormholes , wormholes generated from exotic thin shells .",
    "we study here @xmath0-dimensional thin shell electrically charged wormhole spacetimes with spherical , planar , and hyperbolic geometry ( each with possible different topologies ) , with a cosmological constant term within general relativity .",
    "the motivation for this general analysis comes from several fronts .",
    "the study of objects in @xmath0-dimensions was already of interest when one invoked kaluza - klein small extra dimensions within fundamental theories , and it has become even more interesting and important since the proposal of the possible existence of a universe with extra large dimensions @xcite .",
    "assuming such a scenario of large extra dimensions is correct , one can possibly make tiny small distinct objects such as black holes and wormholes of sizes of the order of the new planck scale .",
    "the introduction of a cosmological constant in the study of new objects is advisable since from astronomical observations , it seems that we presently live in a world with a positive cosmological constant , @xmath2 , i.e. , in an asymptotically de sitter universe .",
    "in addition , a spacetime with @xmath3 , an anti - de sitter spacetime , is also of significant relevance since it allows a consistent physical interpretation when one enlarges general relativity into a gauge extended supergravity theory in which the vacuum state has negative energy density , i.e. , a negative cosmological constant .",
    "if these theories are correct , they imply that the anti - de sitter spacetime should be considered as a symmetric phase of the theory , although it must have been broken as we do not presently live in a universe with @xmath3 .",
    "moreover a @xmath3 anti - de sitter spacetime permits a consistent theory of strings in any dimension , and it has been conjectured that these spacetimes have a direct correspondence with certain conformal field theories on the boundary of that space , the ads - cft conjecture .",
    "even with its preference to negative cosmological constant scenarios , string theory can , although in a contrived way , produce a landscape of positive cosmological constant universes , indicating perhaps that one can transit between both signs of the cosmological constant , see @xcite for all these aspects related to the cosmological constant .",
    "once one starts to discuss extra dimensions and a cosmological constant term then the objects under study , black holes or wormholes , say , can have different geometries and topologies . indeed , in the @xmath3 case , besides spherical symmetric horizons",
    ", black holes can have planar and hyperbolic symmetric horizons , each one of these new geometries admitting different topologies @xcite .",
    "also , contrary to black holes with a spherical horizon , black holes with planar and hyperbolic symmetric horizons have the property that infinity carries the same topology as the throat .",
    "one can go beyond black hole solutions and build , upon addition of exotic matter , traversable wormholes with the same corresponding symmetries and topologies , by natural extension of the corresponding black hole solutions . in these new planar and hyperbolic geometries",
    ", infinity carries the same topology as the throat , whereas in the spherical geometry infinity is the usual corresponding asymptotic spacetime . in this sense",
    ", the construction of the planar and hyperbolic symmetric wormholes does not alter the topology of the background spacetime ( i.e. , spacetime is not multiply - connected ) , so that these solutions can be considered higher - dimensional domain walls or branes .",
    "note that the @xmath4 and @xmath3 wormhole spacetimes allow valid definitions for the mass and charge , and when the wormholes have rotation angular momentum is also well defined @xcite .",
    "so , this gives further reasons to study , besides wormhole structures in positive cosmological constant spacetimes , wormhole structures in zero and negative cosmological constant spacetimes .",
    "finally , electric charge is a fundamental property of matter , and the electromagnetic field is a fundamental interaction between electrically charged objects .",
    "objects with a distribution of electric charge of the same sign suffer internal repulsion , which counteracts the effects of attractive gravitation .",
    "moreover , the concept of wormholes was invented by wheeler to provide a mechanism for having charge without charge , since the field lines seen in one part of the universe could thread the handles of a multiply connected spacetime and reappear in the other part .",
    "this idea was indeed corroborated by wheeler and other authors when they showed the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions , when fully extended , really should be interpreted as wormholes , although non - traversable , the latter a wormhole with electric charge @xcite . as such it is always of interest to see the effects of a net electric charge in wormholes .",
    "so these are the fields and matter which we consider in our wormhole and domain wall building . using the usual cut - and - paste technique @xcite",
    "we find , from the vacuum solutions , thin - shell electrically charged wormholes with different geometric - topologies in @xmath0-dimensional general relativity with a cosmological constant .",
    "we study the properties of the solutions and analyze perturbations in the linear regime .",
    "our general solutions encompass previous solutions which can be reobtained as particular cases of our analysis . indeed ,",
    "previous results in @xmath5 and in other dimensions can be taken from our general expression , in particular the results in @xcite are reobtained as particular cases .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] we use the cut - and - paste technique in order to build static wormholes from the gluing , above the gravitational radius ( or the would - be horizon ) , of the @xmath0-dimensional electrically charged spacetimes , with a negative cosmological constant and with several geometries and topologies . in sec .",
    "[ ex ] we study the properties of these wormholes by providing the exotic conditions and analyzing the motion of test particles in the wormhole background . in sec .",
    "[ linearized stability ] a linearized stability analysis is performed around the static configurations .",
    "our general result is then shown to recover previously calculated conditions for static wormholes in particular dimensions , in particular geometries and topologies , with and without electric charge , and with and without a cosmological constant . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "the velocity of light and newton s constant are put equal to one throughout .",
    "[ subsubsection1.1.1 ] we consider einstein s equations in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the einstein tensor , @xmath0 is the dimension of the spacetime , @xmath8 is the cosmological constant , @xmath9 is the generic metric , and @xmath10 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "greek indices are spacetime indices , latin indices are spacetime indices out of the shell .",
    "equation ( [ general einstein ] ) is supplemented by the maxwell equation , but since it is rather trivial , it is not necessary to explicitly display it .",
    "the general static metric solution for a @xmath0-dimensional vacuum spacetime , with electric charge , cosmological constant and different @xmath11 geometric - topologies is given in the form @xmath12 with the metric function @xmath13 given by @xmath14 and where @xmath15 are schwarzschildean coordinates , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are mass and charge parameters , respectively , and the cosmological constant @xmath8 being zero or of either sign , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the geometric - topological factor of the @xmath11-dimensional @xmath19 , @xmath20 surfaces , with @xmath21 for spherical , planar , and hyperbolic geometries , respectively .",
    "the spherical geometry can only have @xmath11-dimensional surfaces with spherical topology and with infinity behaving normally . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath11-dimensional hyperbolic and planar geometries can have different topologies , depending on whether they are infinite in extent or somehow compactified to produce different @xmath11-dimensional surfaces , and with infinity following the topology of those @xmath11-dimensional surfaces .",
    "for instance , in @xmath5 the situation simplifies , the @xmath22 , @xmath20 surfaces are 2-surfaces and can be classified . for spherical symmetry each 2-surface is compact ( genus zero ) spherical surface . in planar geometry",
    "each 2-surface can be an infinite plane , a cylindrical surface , or a compact ( genus one ) toroidal surface .",
    "in hyperbolic geometry each 2-surface can be an infinite hyperbolic plane , or a compact ( genus two or greater ) toroidal surface with several holes . for surfaces in higher dimensions",
    "the topologies can be even a lot more complicated @xcite .",
    "now , @xmath23 is given by three different expressions according to the value of the parameter @xmath18 , @xmath24 one should note that the mass and charge terms above in eq .",

    "( [ general metric])-([metric function ] ) , when extended to all @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , yield black hole solutions . thus , in studying wormholes the matter is put outside the gravitational radius @xmath34 .",

    "( [ general metric])-([angular metric differentials ] ) , removing from each copy the spacetime region given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant and @xmath34 is the gravitational radius given as the largest positive solution @xmath37 to the equation @xmath38 .",
    "the latter condition , @xmath39 , is important in order not to have an event horizon . with the removal of these regions of each spacetime ,",
    "we are left with two geodesically incomplete manifolds , with the following timelike hypersurfaces as boundaries @xmath40 the identification of these two timelike hypersurfaces , @xmath41 , results in a manifold , now geodesically complete , where two regions are connected by a wormhole .",
    "this wormhole has a throat at @xmath42 , which is the separating surface between the two regions @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , this cut - and - paste technique treats the throat as a hypersurface between two regions of spacetime , where all the exotic matter is concentrated , making the wormhole solution a thin - shell wormhole solution . in this thin - shell case",
    "the location of the two mouths coincide with that of the throat .",
    "to continue the analysis we need to use the darmois - israel formalism .",

    "these traversable wormhole solutions are a natural extension of the corresponding black hole solutions upon the addition of exotic matter . for the plane and hyperbolic traversable wormhole solutions",
    ", infinity carries the same topology as the the topology of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath11-dimensional surfaces of the background spacetime .",

    "now we turn to the issue of the energy conditions on the shell . in our case",
    "the weak energy condition is given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "now , when @xmath0 is increased , this horizontal asymptote approaches a certain value . in the limit @xmath224 , this value is @xmath227 for spherical and hyperbolic geometries , and @xmath228 for planar geometry ( see fig .",
