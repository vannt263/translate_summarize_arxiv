    "goussarov @xcite and the author @xcite independently introduced topological calculus of surgery along claspers .",
    "one of the main achievements in these theories is the following characterization of the topological information carried by goussarov - vassiliev finite type invariants @xcite : two knots in @xmath2 have the same values for any goussarov - vassiliev invariant of degree@xmath3 if and only if they are related by a sequence of _ @xmath1-moves _ @xcite . here",
    "a @xmath1-move is defined as surgery along a certain type of _ tree clasper _ , which is a framed unitrivalent tree with each univalent vertex attached to the knot .",
    "in @xcite , the author also introduced the notion of _ graph claspers _ for links , which is a generalization of the notion of tree claspers , where the tree part is replaced by a unitrivalent graph .",
    "there we explained the idea that graph claspers may be regarded as _ topological realizations _ of unitrivalent graphs ( also called feynman diagrams , jacobi diagrams , etc . ) used by bar - natan @xcite to describe the structure of the graded quotients of the goussarov - vassiliev filtration .",
    "recall that , in the diagram level , any connected , unitrivalent graph diagram on a @xmath4-manifold is equivalent under the @xmath5 relations to a linear combination of tree diagrams .",
    "the purpose of this short note is to prove a topological version of the above - mentioned fact : surgery along a strict graph clasper @xmath6 for a link can be replaced by a sequence of surgeries along strict tree claspers of the same degree as @xmath6 .",
    "we freely use the definitions , notations and conventions in @xcite .    in the following",
    ", @xmath7 denotes a compact , connected , oriented @xmath8-manifold .    a _ tangle _ @xmath9 in @xmath7 is a `` link '' in the sense of @xcite , i.e. , a proper embedding @xmath10 of a compact , oriented @xmath4-manifold @xmath11 into @xmath7 . as usual , we systematically confuse @xmath9 and the image @xmath12 .",
    "a link in the usual sense is a tangle consisting only of circle components .    two tangles @xmath9 and @xmath13 in @xmath7 are _ equivalent _ , denoted by @xmath14 , if @xmath9 and @xmath13 are ambient isotopic fixing the endpoints .    for the definitions of",
    "claspers _ , _ tree claspers _ and _ graph claspers _ , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ,  2 ,  8.2 ) .",
    "note that a tree clasper is a special kind of connected graph clasper .",
    "a graph clasper @xmath6 is called _ strict _ if @xmath6 has no leaves .",
    "i.e. , a strict graph clasper is a clasper consisting only of disk - leaves , nodes , and edges .",
    "an important property of a strict graph clasper @xmath6 for a tangle @xmath9 in @xmath7 is that @xmath6 is _ tame _ ( see @xcite ) , and consequently surgery along @xmath6 does not change the @xmath8-manifold up to canonical homeomorphism . ( the proof of this fact is similar to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) . )",
    "thus we may regard the result @xmath15 from @xmath9 of surgery along @xmath6 as a tangle in @xmath7 .",
    "a disk - leaf @xmath16 in a clasper for a tangle @xmath9 is _ simple _ if @xmath16 intersects @xmath9 by only one point .",
    "a strict graph clasper is _ simple _ if all the disk - leaves are simple .    for @xmath17 , a _",
    "@xmath1-move _ is a local move on a tangle defined as surgery along a strict tree clasper of degree @xmath0 .",
    "the _ @xmath1-equivalence _ on tangles is generated by @xmath1-moves and equivalence .",
    "the purpose of this note is to prove the following .",
    "[ r1 ] let @xmath9 be a tangle in a compact , connected , oriented @xmath8-manifold @xmath7 , and let @xmath6 be a strict graph clasper for @xmath9 in @xmath7 of degree @xmath18 , which is not necessarily simple",
    ". then @xmath9 and @xmath15 are @xmath1-equivalent .",
    "( consequently , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.17 ) , there are finitely many disjoint simple tree claspers @xmath19 for @xmath9 of degree @xmath0 such that @xmath20 . )        let @xmath23 .",
    "if we have the assertion for the case when @xmath6 is simple , then we have the general case by replacing a single strand by a parallel family of strands .",
    "hence we may assume that @xmath6 is simple .",
    "( this assumption is just for simplifying explanations and figures . )",
    "choose any disk - leaf @xmath24 of @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath23 , @xmath24 is joined by an edge to a node .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the the strict graph clasper obtained from @xmath6 by move 9 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.7 ) and isotopy as depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we have @xmath26 .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "@xmath25 consists of two components @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "_ we have @xmath31 for @xmath32 , let @xmath33 be a small regular neighborhood of @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 is empty .",
    "let @xmath36 , which is a tangle in @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the component which intersects @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the new disk - leaf in @xmath34 , which intersects @xmath39 . by the induction hypothesis and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.17 ) , for @xmath32 , there is a clasper @xmath40 consisting of finitely many disjoint , simple strict tree claspers of degree @xmath41 for @xmath42 in @xmath33 , such that @xmath43 for @xmath32 , @xmath44 consists of two components @xmath45 , where these components for @xmath32 placed in @xmath39 in the order @xmath46 .",
    "for each of these arcs @xmath46 , there are finitely many intersecting disk - leaves and finitely many winding edges , as depicted in the left - hand side of figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "slide the disk - leaves and edges of @xmath47 around @xmath48 along @xmath39 to traverse those of @xmath49 around @xmath50 .",
