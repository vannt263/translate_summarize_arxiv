    "uncertainty quantification of complex systems entails stochastic computing for a large number of random variables .",
    "although the sampling - based methods can solve any stochastic problem , they generally require numerous deterministic trials and are , therefore , cost - prohibitive when each analysis demands expensive finite - element or similar numerical calculations .",
    "existing analytical or approximate methods require additional assumptions , mostly for computational expediency , that begin to deteriorate when the input - output mapping is highly nonlinear and the input variance is arbitrarily large . furthermore , truly high - dimensional problems are all but impossible to solve using most existing methods , including numerical integration .",
    "the root deterrence to practical computability is often related to the high dimension of the multivariate integration or interpolation problem , known as the _ curse of dimensionality _",
    "@xcite . the dimensional decomposition of a multivariate function @xcite addresses the curse of dimensionality to some extent by developing an input - output behavior of complex systems with low _ effective dimension _",
    "@xcite , wherein the degrees of interactions between input variables attenuate rapidly or vanish altogether .",
    "a prominent variant of dimensional decomposition is the well - known analysis - of - variance or anova dimensional decomposition ( add ) , first presented by hoeffding in the 1940s in relation to his seminal work on @xmath0-statistics @xcite .",
    "since then , add has been studied by numerous researchers in disparate fields of mathematics @xcite , statistics @xcite , finance @xcite , and basic and applied sciences @xcite , including engineering disciplines , mostly for uncertainty quantification @xcite .",
    "however , add constitutes a finite sum of lower - dimensional component functions of a multivariate function , and is , therefore , predicated on the additive nature of a function decomposition .",
    "in contrast , when a response function is dominantly of a multiplicative nature , suitable multiplicative - type decompositions , such as factorized dimensional decomposition ( fdd ) @xcite , should be explored .",
    "but existing truncations of fdd are limited to only univariate or bivariate approximations , because fdd component functions of three or more variables have yet to be determined .",
    "no error analyses exist comparing add and fdd , even for respective univariate approximations . nonetheless , add or fdd is relevant as long as the dimensional hierarchy of a stochastic response is also additive or multiplicative .",
    "unfortunately , the dimensional structure of a response function , in general , is not known _ a priori_. therefore , indiscriminately using add or fdd for general stochastic analysis is not desirable .",
    "further complications may arise when a complex system exhibits a response that is dominantly neither additive nor multiplicative . in the latter case , hybrid approaches coupling both additive and multiplicative decompositions , preferably selected optimally , are needed . for such decompositions , it is unknown which truncation parameter should be selected when compared with that for add or fdd .",
    "is it possible to solve a stochastic problem by selecting a lower truncation parameter for hybrid decompositions than for add or fdd ? if the answer is yes , then a significant , positive impact on high - dimensional uncertainty quantification is anticipated .",
    "these enhancements , some of which are indispensable , should be pursued without sustaining significant additional cost .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "firstly , a brief exposition of add and fdd is given in section 3 .",
    "a theorem , proven herein , reveals the relationship between all component functions of fdd and add , so far available only for univariate and bivariate component functions .",
    "three function classes , comprising purely additive functions , purely multiplicative functions , and their mixtures , are examined to illustrate when and how one decomposition or approximation is better than the other .",
    "secondly , a new hybrid approach optimally blending add and fdd approximations , referred to as hybrid dimensional decomposition ( hdd ) , is presented in section 4 for second - moment analysis . both linear and nonlinear mixtures of",
    "add and fdd approximations are supported . gaining insights from fdd and hdd , alternative definitions of effective dimension are proposed .",
    "thirdly , section 5 reports new explicit formulae for respective univariate approximations derived from add , fdd , and hdd .",
    "the mean - squared error analyses pertaining to univariate add , fdd , and hdd approximations are also described .",
    "numerical results from four elementary yet illuminating examples and a practical engineering problem are reported in sections 3 through 5 as relevant .",
    "there are nine new theoretical results stated or proved in this paper : theorems [ thm:1 ] , [ thm:2 ] , and [ thm:3 ] , corollaries [ cor:1 ] , [ cor:3 ] , and [ cor:4 ] , propositions [ prop:3 ] and [ prop:4 ] , and lemma [ lem:1 ] .",

    "<S> this article advocates factorized and hybrid dimensional decompositions ( fdd / hdd ) , as alternatives to analysis - of - variance dimensional decomposition ( add ) , for second - moment statistical analysis of multivariate functions . </S>",
    "<S> new formulae revealing the relationships between component functions of fdd and add are proposed . </S>",
    "<S> while add or fdd is relevant when a function is strongly additive or strongly multiplicative , hdd , whether formed linearly or nonlinearly , requires no specific dimensional hierarchies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fdd and hdd lead to alternative definitions of effective dimension , reported in the current literature only for add . new closed - form or analytical expressions are derived for univariate truncations of all three decompositions , followed by mean - squared error analysis of univariate add , fdd , and hdd approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis finds appropriate conditions when one approximation is better than the other . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results affirm the theoretical finding that hdd is ideally suited to a general function approximation that may otherwise require higher - variate add or fdd truncations for rendering acceptable accuracy in stochastic solutions .    </S>",
