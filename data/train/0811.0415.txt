    "x - ray and gamma - ray imaging spectrometers with good spatial and energy resolutions are desired for medical , industrial and astrophysical applications .",
    "cadmium telluride ( cdte ) and cadmium zinc telluride ( czt ) are very promising materials for hard x - ray and gamma - ray imaging spectrometers , given their high detection efficiency comparable to that of nai scintillators and good energy resolution comparable to that of ge detectors .",
    "although both cdte and czt are vulnerable to energy resolution and peak detection efficiency being degraded due to their poor charge transport properties , several techniques have been developed to maintain good spectral performance @xcite .",
    "cdte / czt semiconductor detectors require segmented readout electrodes in order to obtain position information . for imagers having a fine position resolution , there are two types of detector configurations : pixel detectors and double - sided strip detectors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pixeldssd ] ) .",
    "a pixel detector has a number of small pixel electrodes on one side .",
    "the signal from each pixel is processed with each charge - sensitive amplifier . since the leakage current and the detector capacitance",
    "become very small , ideal spectral performance is consequently possible .",
    "however , an extremely large number of readout channels are needed for a fine position resolution and/or large detection area .",
    "additionally , a two - dimensional readout asic is essential for fine pitch pixels @xcite .",
    "a double - sided strip detector ( dsd or cross strip detector ) realizes a fine position resolution and large detection area with a relatively small number of readout channels .",
    "the dsd has orthogonal strips implemented on both its sides . by reading out the signal from both side strips",
    "coincidentally , it is possible to obtain information on the position and energy of the x - ray / gamma - ray photons @xcite .",
    "the number of the readout channels is proportional to @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 denotes the number of segments per coordinate ) for dsds , instead of @xmath4 for pixel detectors .",
    "therefore , for a larger @xmath3 ( meaning a finer position resolution and/or larger area ) , the dsd has an advantage in terms of readout channels .",
    "moreover , one - dimensional asics that are easier to implement and more common than two - dimensional ones are also applicable to dsds .",
    "our development is aimed at hard x - ray imaging detectors for the astro - h ( next ) project that plans to launch japan s 6th x - ray astronomy satellite in 2013 . among the major objectives",
    "is achieving high sensitivity observation with focusing and imaging capabilities in the 580  kev energy region .",
    "the astro - h satellite will carry two hard x - ray telescopes that feature multilayer supermirrors assembled in grazing incident x - ray telescopes .",
    "hard x - ray imagers ( the focal plane detectors of hard x - ray telescopes ) require an energy resolution of @xmath5  1  kev ( fwhm : full width at half maximum ) , energy coverage of 580  kev , a sub - mm ( 250500  @xmath0 m ) position resolution , detection area of 23  cm , and timing resolution of @xmath5  1  @xmath0s for high sensitivity observation . to achieve these goals",
    ", we have developed cdte diode dsds as a primary choice for hard x - ray imagers . in this paper",
    ", we describe our development of cdte dsds , and report the results of the cdte dsd prototypes",
    ". we also report on our newly developed asic ( va32ta6 ) for semiconductor detector readout .",
    "thin cdte diode devices that utilize indium ( in ) as the anode electrodes on p - type cdte wafers manufactured by acrorad ( japan ) and platinum ( pt ) as the cathodes have been established and offer good spectral performance @xcite .",
    "a high schottky barrier formed on the in / p - cdte interface enables use of the detector as a diode .",
    "using this type of detector with a thickness of 0.5  mm at applied bias voltages as high as 1  kv makes it possible to overcome the poor charge transport properties of cdte .",
    "however , double - sided strip detectors with in anodes can not be realized since it is difficult to segment the in electrode into strips .",
    "aluminum ( al ) has recently been found to be a good alternative electrode material to in @xcite .",
    "in addition to low leakage currents and high energy resolutions comparable to those of in / cdte / pt detectors , al / cdte / pt detectors also offer the advantage of allowing al anodes to be divided into pixels or strips .",
    "cdte diode detectors with segmented al anodes have been established by constructing and testing al - pad / cdte / pt or al - pixel / cdte / pt type detectors .",
    "good spectral performance ( @xmath6  @xmath5  1  kev(fwhm ) at 60  kev ) has been achieved @xcite .    by adopting segmented al anodes and pt cathodes",
    ", we can obtain a cdte diode double - sided strip device .",
    "for the prototype detectors , we fabricated two types of the cdte devices : the 2.6  cm cdte device and 1.3  cm cdte device .",
    "the 2.6  cm cdte device is 2.6  cm  @xmath7  2.6  cm in size , and 500  @xmath0 m thick . on each side",

    "therefore , it is difficult to interconnect the cdte strip electrodes and the readout asic input pads by using wire - bonding as applied to si dsds @xcite .    to overcome this problem , we adopted the in / au stud bump bonding technique and used the al@xmath8o@xmath9 ceramic fan - out board with through - holes .",
