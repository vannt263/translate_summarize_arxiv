    "hadrons are bound states of the strong interaction which is described by the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the framework of the yang - mills gauge theory .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in particle physics is to understand the hadrons such as the proton and the neutron in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom . due to the nonperturbative nature of the qcd ,",
    "it is complicated to calculate the properties and structures of hadrons , especially when the relativistic effects are taken into account .",
    "although euclidean lattice methods provide a very important first principle numerical simulation of the nonperturbative qcd  @xcite , it is limited by the enormous computational complexity , and dynamical observables in the minkowski space - time are not directly obtained from the euclidean lattice computations .",
    "the dyson - schwinger and bethe - salpeter methods are also powerful tools in studying the confinement and the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , but in practice the analyses are limited to the ladder approximation in the landau gauge .",
    "thus , at present , phenomenological models are necessary and helpful for us to provide a physical picture of the structure of hadrons .",
    "the constituent quark model  @xcite and the parton model  @xcite are proved successful in classifying the hadrons and explaining the experimental observations in high energy hadron scatterings . the light - cone form  @xcite of",
    "the qcd reconciles the covariant non - abelian quantum field theory and these models . in this form the fields",
    "are quantized at the fixed light - cone time @xmath0 instead of the usual time @xmath1 , and its simple qcd vacuum structure allows an unambiguous definition of the constituents of a hadron .",
    "the hadronic properties are all encoded in the lignt - cone wave function in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom , and the wave function is fully relativistic and frame - independent  @xcite .",
    "the diquark was first mentioned in gell - mann s paper on quarks  @xcite .",

    "the diquark is the remaining constituents of the nucleon to provide the other quantum numbers , and some nonperturbative effects are taken into account by the mass of the spectator effectively . in order to provide a relativistic description , the wigner rotation  @xcite or the melosh transformation  @xcite , which relate the spinors in the instant form to those in the light - cone form ,",

    "therefore , it is necessary to extand its application to other physical observables as a further test and to help us understand the structure of nucleons more clearly .    in this paper , we calculate the generalized form factors of the nucleon in the light - cone spectator - diquark model .",
    "compared to the ordinary form factors , they contain some more information about the internal structure of the nucleon .",
