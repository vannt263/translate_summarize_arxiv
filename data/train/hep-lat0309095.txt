    "the fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian give much insight into the dynamics of the underlying system .",
    "in particular , the so - called nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 , i.e. , the distribution of spacings @xmath2 between adjacent eigenvalues plays an important role . according to the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture @xcite , quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic have a @xmath1 given by random matrix theory ( rmt ) whereas systems whose classical counterparts are integrable obey a poisson distribution , @xmath3 . in this sense ,",
    "the form of @xmath1 characterizes quantum chaos .    today we know a number of physical systems where wigner and poisson behavior is observed  @xcite .",
    "here we test a one - dimensional chain of @xmath4 coupled harmonic oscillators , with anharmonic perturbation  @xcite .",
    "its euclidean action is given by @xmath5 in the continuum formulation it corresponds to the scalar @xmath0 model , @xmath6 introducing a space - time lattice with lattice spacing @xmath7 and @xmath8 , this action becomes @xmath9 ~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the actions given by eq.([action_scalar ] ) and eq.([action_osc ] ) can be identified by posing @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .    for the underlying real and symmetric matrix one",
    "expects a correspondence to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "the rmt result for @xmath1 is quite complicated ; it can be expressed in terms of so - called prolate spheroidal functions , see ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath1 has also been tabulated . a very good approximation to @xmath1",
    "is provided by @xmath14 which is the wigner surmise for the goe .",
    "analytic stochastic    @xmath15 @xmath16    @xmath17 @xmath18    we computed the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ action_scalar ] ) via the monte carlo hamiltonian method using a stochastic basis  @xcite .",
    "this is a concept to calculate eigenvalues and eigenstates ( in some energy window ) of field theories or many - body systems .    to construct @xmath1 , one first has to `` unfold '' the spectra @xcite",
    "this procedure is a @xmath19 rescaling of the energy scale so that the mean level spacing is equal to unity on the unfolded scale .",
    "ensemble and spectral averages ( the latter is possible because of the spectral ergodicity property of rmt ) are only meaningful after unfolding .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 for the chain of harmonic oscillators with @xmath20 .",
    "this case reduces to the klein - gordon model which is classically integrable and thus a free theory .",
    "the quantized system of @xmath21 oscillators has a highly degenerate spectrum .",
    "we keep in mind that a single harmonic oscillator is an exceptional situation which would lead to a @xmath22-function at @xmath23 after formal unfolding . the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts @xmath1 of the analytically known spectrum for @xmath24 oscillators .",
    "it might consist of a washed out peak from the harmonic oscillator spacing and of a peak around the origin from the poisson distribution of the lifted degeneracies . the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] presents @xmath1 for the corresponding spectrum obtained from the stochastic basis ( breaking parity and translational invariance ) with 1000 elements",
    ". it clearly exhibits wigner behavior with the underlying symmetry of the goe .",
    "it seems that the `` holes '' in the matrix produced by the method give effectively a random matrix .",
    "although the individual exact eigenvalues are well reproduced  @xcite their fluctuations are different leading to a completely different dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 for the oscillator chain when the anharmonic term is switched on , @xmath25 .",
    "we vary the length of the chain from @xmath26 to @xmath24 and take @xmath27 states for the stochastic basis ( with parity symmetry implemented ) into account .",
    "the plots are inconclusive and might show a trend to uncorrelated eigenvalues compared to @xmath20 which could be an effect from the deeper quartic potential",
    ". it will be interesting to see if this is enhanced with increased @xmath28 .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the spectrum of a finite chain of oscillators , with and without a quartic coupling .",
    "the infinitely long chain of harmonic oscillators is equivalent to the klein - gordon model being a free theory .",
    "its spectrum is known analytically also for finite @xmath21 .",
    "we tested a stochastic method and obtained a spectrum corresponding to a wigner distribution in contrast to the theoretical expectation .",
    "only preliminary results could be collected for the anharmonic oscillators and conclusions have to be drawn in the future increasing the stochastic basis and the coupling space .",
    "this study is part of a general concept where random matrix theory is used to distinguish between the quality of a model compared to a theory or experiment .",
    "an analysis in this respect is being performed with a quark potential model and the experimental hadron spectrum  @xcite .",
