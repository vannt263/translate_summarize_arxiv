    "in the classic cold dark matter ( cdm ) picture of galaxy formation , gas falling into dark matter halos is shock - heated approximately to the halo virial temperature , @xmath11 maintaining quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter component @xcite .",
    "then , given a density - profile for the gas , a cooling radius can be calculated , inside of which the gas can radiate its thermal energy away , losing its pressure support , and settling into a centrifugally supported disk while conserving its specific angular momentum @xcite .",
    "eventually the collapsing gas reaches high enough densities to allow for star formation and a stellar disk is grown from the inside out . over the years this simplified picture has been updated and extended into the powerful framework of semi - analytic galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) that has been successful in reproducing many of the present - day properties of observed galaxies .    a first challenge of the standard model of galaxy formation was already brought up by @xcite , who used analytical models of protogalactic collapse to argue that under some plausible physical conditions the fraction of shock - heated gas could be small with the majority of the gas having temperatures below @xmath12 .",
    "this idea was revived by @xcite , who assuming spherical symmetry showed that galaxy halos can only shock - heat infalling gas if the cooling rate for gas behind the shock is lower than the compression rate of the infalling gas .",
    "this criterion translates to a critical minimum mass for halos that are able to shock - heat the infalling gas of @xmath13 , with this mass being roughly independent of redshift and very similar to the critical mass isolated already in the papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "halos below this mass are not massive enough to support stable shocks and the majority of their gas is accreted cold .",
    "however , galaxies above the critical shock mass can also be fed with cold gas along filaments penetrating deep inside the hot halo .",
    "this general picture has since been confirmed in cosmological simulations using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) @xcite and adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) @xcite techniques .    since the early days of galaxy studies it has been clear that the majority of galaxies come in two types , either as early - type elliptical galaxies or late - type spiral disk galaxies as manifested in the classical hubble sequence @xcite",
    "several recent large statistical surveys of the local galaxy population , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two - degree field ( 2df ) surveys , have made this bimodality even more robust .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the division between the two classes of galaxies is associated with a critical stellar mass of @xmath14 .",
    "galaxies below this critical mass are typically blue , star - forming disk galaxies that lie in the field , whereas galaxies above @xmath15 are dominated by red spheroidal systems with old stellar populations that can be found both in overdense regions and in the field .    due to the inherent complexity and non - linearity of the galaxy formation process",
    ", numerical computer simulations have become the ideal tool for studying structure formation .",
    "interestingly , most numerical studies starting from cosmological initial conditions have concentrated on the formation of late - type milky way - like galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "much less effort has been spent on studying elliptical galaxies ( @xcite , hereafter n07 ; @xcite ) which is somewhat surprising as they contain a significant fraction of the stars in the universe @xcite with the most massive galaxies known all being spheroidal systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .    however , a proposed formation mechanism of elliptical galaxies that has been studied extensively is the binary merger scenario , in which elliptical galaxies are formed from the merger of two spiral galaxies .",
    "this picture is moderately successful in producing the component of intermediate mass , fast - rotating disky ellipticals with anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "however , the binary merger scenario has problems in reproducing the massive old metal - rich slowly - rotating boxy ellipticals , which are characterized by low ellipticities and more isotropic velocities @xcite .",
    "the massive slowly rotating ellipticals are better reproduced in simulations set in the cosmological context , in which the galaxy is assembled from multiple , hierarchical mergers of star - bursting subunits .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter j09 ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the growth of structure in the cdm model is hierarchical , a naive reading of the model implies that the most massive galaxies residing in the most massive halos would form last .",
    "however , two recent key observational results have challenged this notion .",
    "firstly , there is now very strong observational evidence that old , massive red metal - rich galaxies were already in place at redshifts of z=2 - 3 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result can also be seen as a manifestation of cosmic downsizing , in which the most massive galaxies formed a significant proportion of their stars at high redshifts , compared to the lower mass systems that have been forming stars over the whole cosmic epoch ( e.g. ) .",
    "secondly , there now also exists observational evidence for significant growth in both the size ( e.g. @xcite ) and mass ( e.g. @xcite ) of massive ellipticals since z=2 - 3 until the present - day .",
    "the observed @xmath16 ellipticals are also typically an order of magnitude denser than their local counterparts and would need , in the absence of mergers , to undergo significant secular and internal evolution since @xmath16 in order to match the local galaxy population ( e.g. ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this first paper ( paper i ) building on previous work of n07 ; j09 ; @xcite we explore in more detail the cosmological formation of massive ellipticals using high - resolution numerical simulations to determine if the two phase picture provides a useful interpretation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we expand on our previous simulation sample by including a total of 9 galaxies simulated using cooling , star formation and feedback from type ii supernovae . in agreement with our earlier studies",
    "we find that the simulated galaxies do assemble in two phases : the initial growth is dominated by compact @xmath2 in situ star formation fueled by cold gas flows , whereas the late growth is dominated by accretion of stars formed in subunits outside the main galaxy .",
    "the accreted stars assemble predominantly at larger radii @xmath17 explaining both the size and mass growth of the simulated galaxies in broad agreement with the observations . in a companion paper ( paper ii johansson et al . in prep ) we study the photometric and kinematic properties of our simulated galaxies and perform a detailed comparison between the simulations and recent observations .",

    "we discuss the numerical code , simulation physics and parameters employed in this study .",
    "we begin  [ assembly_hist ] by discussing the assembly history of the dark matter and stellar components of the simulated galaxies .",
    "we then continue by discussing the size evolution and dark matter fractions of the galaxies as a function of their assembly histories . in ",
    "[ thermal_hist_gas ] we discuss the thermal history of the gas component in our simulated galaxies .",
    "here we also demonstrate the importance of cold flows in the early assembly history of the galaxies and discuss the relative importance of supernova and gravitational feedback as a heating source .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our findings in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper were performed using the parallel treesph - code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "the code follows the gas dynamics using the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( e.g. ) technique formulated in such a way that energy and entropy is manifestly conserved @xcite .",

    "we included a spatially uniform redshift - dependent uv background radiation field with a modified @xcite spectrum , where reionization takes place at @xmath18 @xcite and the uv background field peaks at @xmath19 .",
    "for a detailed investigation on the effects of varying the background radiation field on the evolution of the galaxies presented in this paper , see @xcite .    for the simulations presented in n07;j09 we turned off the feedback from supernovae by eliminating the two - phase description of the ism of star - forming particles in order to better understand galactic evolution in the absence of any energetic feedback from non - gravitational sources .",
    "however , in the study presented in this paper we include the full self - regulated supernova feedback model of @xcite in all our simulations . in this model",

    "each gas particle can produce a maximum of two stellar particles per particle , with the resulting stellar particles thus having half the mass of the original gas particles .",

    "the target halos were re - simulated at high resolution by increasing the particle number to @xmath41 and @xmath42 gas and dark matter particles within a cubic volume at redshift @xmath43 containing all particles that ended up within the virialized region ( conservatively we assumed a fixed radius of 0.5 mpc ) of the halos at @xmath9 .",

    "the gravitational softening length for the @xmath46 runs was fixed in comoving units of @xmath47 and @xmath48 until @xmath49 , and after this the softening remained fixed in physical coordinates at 0.25 kpc for gas and stars and 0.5 kpc for dark matter .",
    "the gravitational softening lengths in the @xmath50 simulations were set to half compared to the @xmath46 simulations , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "the sph properties of the gas particles were averaged over the usual gadget-2 spline sph kernel using @xmath59 sph gas particles and we imposed a minimum hydrodynamical smoothing length equal to @xmath60 .",
    "we set the parameters governing the multi - phase feedback model as follows : the star formation timescale @xmath61 , @xmath62 for a salpeter imf @xcite , the cloud evaporation parameter @xmath63 and the supernova temperature @xmath64 that reflects the heating rate from a population of supernovae for a given imf .",
    "these parameter choices result in a star formation rate ( sfr ) that is compatible with the observed kennicutt relation .",

    "[ gas_sfr ] we study the baryonic assembly of our galaxies by plotting the total gas mass within the galaxy radii and their star formation rates as a function of time .",
    "we define the galaxy radius as @xmath88 , meaning that this radius increases with time as the virial radius of the galaxy grows .",
    "in general the gas masses of the galaxies are below @xmath89 during their evolution with typical final gas masses of @xmath90 ( see table [ gal_prop ] ) .",
    "notable exceptions are the most massive galaxies u and y , which have significant late gas inflows at @xmath91 and end up with final gas masses in excess of @xmath89 .",
    "the majority of the gas is hot , where hot gas is defined as gas with @xmath92 ( see @xcite ) , and thus not directly available for star formation .",

    "this general trend is only interrupted by occasional mergers that show up as bumps in the star formation histories . at @xmath96",
    "the typical star formation rates range from @xmath97 and by @xmath9 they have declined to below @xmath98 for all galaxies , but the most massive systems ( u and y ) , which still exhibit residual star formation rates of a few solar masses per year .",
    "in addition , we calculate the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) defined as the @xmath99 , where sfr is the total star formation rate and @xmath100 the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the value at @xmath9 can be found in table [ gal_prop ] , where the current sfr has been calculated using the mean sfr averaged over the last 1 gyr .",

    "this criterion corresponds to @xmath103 at @xmath9 for our chosen cosmology .",
    "thus , according to this criterion all of our galaxies can be classified as quiescent systems , as they exhibit ssfrs below this threshold value at the present - day ( see table [ gal_prop ] ) .",
    "the very low final star formation rates are significant given that the simulations include neither type ia supernova feedback nor agn feedback .          following n07 ( see also @xcite ) we study the origin of the stellar component in our galaxies by dividing the stellar mass into an in situ component formed within the galaxy ( @xmath104 ) and an accreted stellar component formed outside the galaxy ( @xmath105 ) , where again the galaxy radius is defined as @xmath106 at the corresponding time .",
    "the galaxies in our sample are organized into three groups depending on whether their late accretion history @xmath107 is dominated primarily by dissipationless minor merging ( mostly accreted stars ) , a mixed disspationless / dissipational ( mostly accreted and some in situ stars ) or a primarily dissipational ( significant in situ stars ) formation history .",
    "we find that this classification of the assembly history divides the simulated galaxies broadly into more massive early - type galaxies with strong size evolution forming dissipationlessly and less massive later - type galaxies with weaker size evolution and a more dissipational formation history .",
    "the evolution of the accreted and in situ stellar components together with the total stellar mass is shown for our entire galaxy sample in fig .",
    "[ insitu_acc ] .",
    "the galaxies are grouped into three groups of three galaxies depending on whether the majority of the final stellar mass was accreted ( c2 , u & y ) , whether in situ and accreted stellar mass were of roughly equal importance ( a2 , q & t ) or whether in situ star formation played a dominant role ( e2 , l & m , see table [ gal_prop ] ) . note that although both galaxies m and e2 have more accreted stellar mass at @xmath9 , this is in both cases due to a single major merger and that the stellar masses in both galaxies m and e2 prior to their respective mergers were clearly in situ dominated ( see fig . [ downsizing ] ) .    the fraction of in situ to accreted stellar mass correlates with galaxy mass , with the more massive galaxies being typically dominated by accreted stars , whereas the least massive galaxies in our sample have significant in situ formed stellar components ( see also @xcite ) . however , having said that significant variations exist for galaxies with very similar masses , relatively high - mass galaxies such as galaxy a2 can have significant in situ stellar components and a low - mass galaxy such as galaxy q can have a significant contribution from accreted stars .",
    "thus , the final total stellar masses alone do not decide the faith of the galaxies rather the details in the accretion history ( i.e. in situ or accretion dominated ) are of a significant importance in determining the final properties of the galaxies .    in fig .",
    "[ downsizing ] we show the absolute contribution of the in situ and accreted stellar components to the total stellar mass at four redshifts . using this figure and the arrows in fig .",
    "[ insitu_acc ] indicating when half of the corresponding stellar component was assembled a clear formation picture emerges . the stellar component in the galaxies forms in a two phased process . at high redshifts @xmath108",
    "the stellar component in all galaxies is assembled rapidly through in situ star formation , with this star formation being fueled by cold flows ( see  [ coldhot ] ) and hierarchical mergers of multiple star - bursting subunits . at later times @xmath109 in situ star formation",
    "is a subdominant effect with the majority of the stellar growth proceeding through the accretion of existing stellar clumps .",
    "the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ downsizing ] are ordered in decreasing final mass from top to bottom . at very high redshifts ( @xmath110 )",
    "there is no clear correlation between the stellar mass at this redshift and the final stellar mass at @xmath9 .",
    "however by @xmath111 and @xmath96 at the very latest the most massive galaxies at these redshifts finish as the most massive systems at @xmath9 .",
    "most galaxies have typical formation redshifts of their total stellar components of @xmath112 similar to their dm components ( see table [ gal_prop ] and fig . [ insitu_acc ] ) , where @xmath113 is defined again as the redshift at which half of the final stellar mass was assembled . however , interesting exceptions exist , galaxies c2 , y and m , which have significant late accretion have @xmath114 and galaxies q and l , which have very rapid initial growth result in @xmath115 .",
    "the formation redshifts of the in situ made stars are very similar at @xmath3 for all galaxies , whereas the formation redshift of the accreted stars show a much larger scatter at @xmath5 .",
    "again the final stellar mass alone is not the decisive factor , instead there are significant differences in the individual accretion histories for different galaxies in a similar mass range .",
    "finally we plot the mean ages of the in situ and accreted stellar components as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ age_star ] , where the stellar ages are always normalized to the age of the universe at the corresponding redshift . studying this figure",
    "a clear systematic trend can be discerned .",
    "the mean age of the accreted stellar component is always older than the in situ formed stars .",
    "this can be understood naturally in a hierarchical universe as the majority of the accreted stars form individually in low - mass systems at high redshifts , whereas in situ star formation proceeds at a slower rate in the more massive systems .",
    "thus , the accreted stars are typically formed earlier and are older compared to the in situ component . furthermore ,",
    "as discussed above the most massive galaxies typically have a higher fraction of accreted stars and hence have older mean stellar ages . the notion of a two phased galaxy formation process",
    "thus naturally explains the counter - intuitive concept of downsizing .",
    "massive galaxies form their stellar core mass in situ and then accrete substantial amounts of stars that were formed even earlier in smaller subsystems .",
    "hence by @xmath73 the most massive galaxies have the oldest stellar populations compared to lower mass galaxies that have still significant in situ star formation and much lower contribution from accreted stars .",
    "this trend is in good agreement with observations ( e.g. ) and theoretical models ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a natural outcome of the two phased galaxy formation process . at the present - day",
    "the mean stellar ages are typically high at @xmath116 for all our galaxies , except galaxy m , which due to its very late merger has a somewhat younger stellar population at @xmath117 ( see table [ gal_prop ] ) .",
    "we then turn our attention to the size growth of our simulated early - type galaxies by studying the evolution of their projected half - mass radii in fig .",
    "[ rhalf ] , where we plot separately the evolution of @xmath118 for the total stellar component ( top panel ) , the in situ formed component ( middle panel ) and the accreted stars ( bottom panel ) .",
    "all galaxies grow in size by increasing their half - mass radii by factors of several between @xmath111 and the present - day . however , studying fig .",
    "[ rhalf ] it is clear that the in situ and accreted stellar components grow very differently . for most galaxies the size growth of the in situ component is very modest with @xmath119 growing from @xmath120 at @xmath16 to @xmath121 at @xmath122 .",
    "the in situ stars thus form typically at similar small radii in the bulge components of all the galaxies , regardless of the galaxy mass . the situation for the accreted stellar component is very different with strong evolution in @xmath123 from @xmath124 at @xmath16 to @xmath125 at the present - day .    in the two phased formation mechanism",
    "the inner parts of the galaxies are built up primarily from in situ formed stars , whereas the other parts contain predominantly accreted stars , which are thus responsible for the observed size growth of early - type galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the accreted stars are added to the galaxies primarily through dry minor mergers , which are very efficient in increasing the final size of the system and decreasing the final central density as demonstrated in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect the amount of size growth to correlate with the stellar accretion histories , with the systems having the largest amount of accreted stars also showing the strongest size growth .",
    "indeed , this is seen with the sample with a dominant component of accreted stars ( c2 , u & y ) showing average growth in size between @xmath7 and @xmath122 by a factor of @xmath126 , for the samples with galaxies ( a2 , q & t ) and ( e2 , l & m ) the average growth factors are @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . in the case of galaxy m",
    "we also see that a late major merger is not that efficient in increasing the size of the galaxy , with the final @xmath118 being only marginally larger than the pre - merger half - mass radius ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , as the typical stellar accretion history is mass dependent favoring more accreted stars over in situ stars for increasing galaxy mass , we expect that the size evolution will be mass dependent with the most massive galaxies experiencing the strongest size growth .",
    "this finding is also in agreement with the results found by @xcite who used a larger galaxy sample simulated at somewhat lower resolution .",
    "finally we note that the resulting size growth as a function of redshift is much stronger when compared to the corresponding plot in n07 ( their fig .",
    "the reason for this is a different definition of the accretion radius . in the present study",
    "we calculate the half - mass radii of the in situ and accreted component within the galaxy radius ( @xmath106 ) , whereas in the n07 study we used a fixed physical radius of 30 kpc for all redshifts . the definition used in n07 overestimates the half - mass radii of the accreted component at high redshifts and results in a much smaller size growth compared to the definition used in this paper .",
    "related to the size growth we plot in fig .",
    "[ rotcurve ] the circular velocity profiles , defined as @xmath129 for our galaxy sample at redshifts of @xmath9 ( top panel ) , @xmath96 ( middle panel ) and @xmath111 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we also give in this plot the corresponding projected half - mass radii of the total stellar component , demonstrating explicitly the size growth of the galaxies from @xmath111 to the present - day . at high redshifts",
    "the galaxies are compact with their rotation curves peaking at relatively high values of @xmath130 , however none of our galaxies show extreme rotation curves with peaks in excess of @xmath131 as found by @xcite and @xcite . with increasingly lower redshifts the peaks of the rotation curves are systematically shifted to larger radii and also lowered in absolute value demonstrating the size growth of the parent galaxies . at the present - day",
    "the peak of the rotation curve is typically in the range of @xmath132 with only the most massive system ( galaxy u ) having a rotation curve peaking at @xmath133 ( see table [ gal_virprop ] ) .",
    "all of our systems are also clearly baryon dominated in their inner regions with the dm fraction being typically low at @xmath8 within the central 3d half - mass radii ( see table [ gal_prop ] ) .    comparing our rotation curves to the ones presented in n07 for simulations without supernova feedback we see that the rotation curves in the present study peak at values higher by roughly @xmath134 .",
    "in addition , the rotation curves with supernova feedback are also somewhat more centrally peaked indicating a more massive central bulge component .",
    "the main reason for this difference lies in the different star formation threshold .",
    "the density threshold quoted in the n07 paper @xmath135 was missing a factor of @xmath136 and thus the density threshold actually used in the n07 paper was @xmath137 corresponding to @xmath138 , which is about a factor of ten lower than in the present study . in the no feedback simulations presented in n07 stars",

    "thus , the purpose of this paper was to see what aspects of the problems of the formation of massive galaxies could be addressed without invoking major feedback mechanisms and to see if a careful and high resolution treatment from cosmological initial conditions would capture the essential aspects of the formation process . in a companion paper ( paper ii johansson et al . in prep ) we will study the photometric and kinematic properties of our simulated galaxies and compare the results with recent observations of early - type galaxies .    in agreement with our previous studies ( n07 ; j09 ; @xcite ) we find that there are two phases in the formation process of our simulated galaxies .",
    "the initial growth is dominated by compact @xmath2 in situ star formation fueled by cold gas flow resulting in early star formation peaking at very high values of @xmath263 at redshifts of @xmath264 .",
    "the later formation history below redshifts of @xmath265 is dominated by dissipationless accretion of stars formed in subunits outside the main galaxy and the corresponding star formation rates are much lower with typical sfr values of @xmath266 .",
    "the accreted stars assemble predominantly at larger radii @xmath267 explaining both the size and mass growth of the simulated galaxies in broad agreement with the observations .",
    "we also find a relation between the mass of the system and the fraction of accreted stars in the final galaxy , the larger the mass of the final galaxy the higher the fraction of accreted stars .",
    "this being the general picture , differences between the simulated galaxies exist even within a similar mass range caused by variations in the individual accretion histories of the various galaxies .",
    "we also find that gravitational heating due to infalling baryonic lumps of stars and gas is a major physical process that typically releases of the order of @xmath268 ( j09 ) of which about 1/6 @xmath269 goes to the gas and 5/6 to the dark matter , heating the former and pushing out the latter .",
    "the combined effect of gas exhaustion due to early efficient star formation and the energy release from gravitational feedback terminates star formation in most galaxies by @xmath270 , resulting in dead and red ellipticals by @xmath96 in good agreement with the observations .",
    "the three main recent observational results concerning early - type galaxies are firstly the observed bimodality in the local galaxy population that postulates that galaxies below a critical stellar mass of @xmath14 are typically blue , star - forming disk galaxies that lie in the field , whereas galaxies above @xmath15 are dominated by red spheroidal systems with old stellar populations that predominately live in dense environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , there is now very strong observational evidence that old , massive red metal - rich galaxies were already at place at redshifts of z=2 - 3 and that the most massive galaxies formed a significant proportion of their stars at high redshifts ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "thirdly , recent observations have revealed growth in both the size ( e.g. @xcite ) and mass ( e.g. @xcite ) of massive ellipticals since z=2 - 3 until the present - day .",
    "the two - phase formation for elliptical galaxies presented in this paper naturally explains all of these observations . in our simulations the central parts of the galaxies",
    "form very rapidly at high redshifts through cold accretion driven in situ star formation .",
    "the more massive galaxies which are located in higher density regions assemble first , the later formation history of these massive galaxies is then dominated by accretion of stars that were formed in smaller subunits at even earlier times . thus , the more massive a galaxy is the earlier it formed and the older its average stellar population is due to the larger fraction of accreted stars thus explaining the downsizing observations . in our scenario",
    "the observed bimodality can be explained by the combined effect of gas exhaustion due to early star formation and gravitational feedback . in more massive galaxies",
    "the fraction of accreted stars is higher leading to stronger gravitational feedback heating and resulting in stronger suppression of star formation .",
    "less massive galaxies have more ongoing in situ star formation and thus remain bluer throughout .",
    "gravitational feedback is thus a contributing factor in explaining the galaxy bimodality , but also additional heating sources probably in the form of strong supernova driven winds and agn feedback are required to prevent late gas inflows and associated residual star formation .",
    "additionally , the observed size growth of ellipticals is quite naturally explained in our model , in which dry minor mergers are responsible for the size growth , with the most massive galaxies showing the strongest growth in size as they have the largest fraction of accreted stars ( see also @xcite ) . finally , we are able match reasonably well the observational constraints on the central dark matter fractions of early - type galaxies at the present - day . in the two - phased formation picture",
    "the forming galaxies are strongly baryon dominated at high redshifts with correspondingly low dark matter fractions and very steep total density profiles ( @xmath271 ) . at lower redshifts",
    "the central dark matter fractions increase , although the total dark matter masses within @xmath272 are at the same time somewhat reduced due to the input of gravitational heating . at the present - day",
    "our simulated galaxies have central dark matter fractions of @xmath8 , with the logarithmic slope of the total density profile being in the range @xmath10 in good agreement with recent observations @xcite .    we also want to stress the importance of numerical resolution in galaxy formation studies .",
    "when comparing our simulation runs at @xmath50 resolution ( a2,c2,e2 ) to their corresponding runs at @xmath46 resolution ( a , c , e ) , we see some systematic effects .",
    "the final stellar masses in the higher resolution runs are typically lower by @xmath273 and as a result the rotation curves for the @xmath50 runs peak at values that are @xmath274 lower than their corresponding @xmath46 runs with the overall shape also being flatter ( see fig [ rotcurve ] ) .",
    "more importantly the final star formation rates of all the @xmath50 resolution are very low ( @xmath275 ) , with the corresponding @xmath46 resolution simulations having star formation rates that are typically larger by @xmath276 .",
    "resolution has a more minor effect on the baryonic conversion efficiency , as the somewhat lower stellar masses in the high - resolution simulations also correspondingly reside in somewhat lower mass dm halos .",
    "the derived differences are mainly due to the increased input of gravitational heating with increasing resolution , but comparing to the no feedback simulations discussed in n07;j09 we see that the sensitivity to numerical resolution , although still there , is significantly reduced in simulations that include supernova feedback .",
    "thus in conclusion , it is important to perform the cosmological simulations at both sufficient mass @xmath277 and spatial resolution @xmath278 ( see also @xcite for very high resolution simulations of lower mass disk galaxies ) .    despite the many successes of our simple model several problems still remain .",
    "the most pressing issue is the fact that the fractions of available baryons in the halo that is converted into stars in the central galaxy are too high by a factor of @xmath262 compared to the expectation from halo occupation statistics @xcite and to some recent simulations with stronger supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "in addition the final gas fractions and resulting star formation rates while generally low are still somewhat too large , especially for the more massive galaxies in our simulation sample .    a major deficiency of our simulations is the lack of metal - line cooling .",
    "assuming solar metalicities expected in intermediate - mass early - type galaxies and the temperatures of @xmath279 depicted in fig .",
    "[ rates_gas ] would result in cooling rates that were higher by at least one order of magnitude @xcite bringing them much closer to the inferred shock heating rates and thus limiting the ability of gravitational feedback to keep the diffuse halo hot . according to the mass - metalicity relation ( e.g. @xcite ) the most massive galaxies have on average the highest metalicities .",
    "thus the fact that gravitational feedback in unable to prevent cooling in our most massive galaxies u & y even at zero - metalicity is a very strong indication that additional forms of feedback , such as agn feedback is required in massive metal - rich galaxies .",
    "the inclusion of metal - line cooling would also impact the in situ and accreted analysis differentially as the centers of the massive galaxies where the in situ stellar component is formed would have higher metalicities resulting in stronger cooling and star formation , thus increasing the final in situ to accreted stellar mass fraction in our galaxies .",
    "consequently the already severe problem of too high baryon fractions would be made even more critical .",
    "thus , it is clear from the discussion above that just adding metal - line cooling keeping everything else fixed would have a large effect on the results presented in this paper .",
    "specifically , the in situ stellar component would be increased reducing the effect of the accreted stellar component in driving the size growth of the galaxies , the central concentrations of our galaxies would increase making the central baryon fractions even larger and finally the increased cooling would reduce the effects of the gravitational feedback making the case for additional agn feedback in the centers of massive metal - rich galaxies even more pressing .    however , adding just metal - line cooling , without adding the additional heating mechanisms , which to some respect offset the increased cooling would not result in a fair presentation of the underlying baryonic physics .",
    "thus the simultaneous exclusion of both metal - line cooling and strong additional feedback is better justified in this simple model than just including metal - line cooling without the additional feedback physics .",
    "in addition to metal - line cooling we are missing important physical effects such as stellar mass loss ( e.g. @xcite ) and in addition several important heating sources including agn feedback from broad absorption line wind regions and the luminous agn radiative output ( e.g. @xcite ) , radiative driven winds from the coupling with the luminous output of young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) and feedback from type ia supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) in addition to the simplified prescription of type ii supernova feedback currently included in the simulations .",
    "the effect of supernova driven winds and agn feedback is differential with respect to the masses of the galaxies , the former is most important for low - mass galaxies , whereas the latter being only important in more massive galaxies .",
    "we expect that the problem with the too high baryonic conversion efficiency will be mainly addressed by adding stronger supernova driven winds , whereas the problem of residual star formation in massive galaxies is best addressed by adding agn feedback and type i supernova that are both mostly effective in the cores of massive galaxies .",
    "an additional factor for suppressing late star formation would be simply increasing the numerical resolution of the simulation as clearly demonstrated in n07 .",
    "we have completed preliminary work including strong supernova wind feedback @xcite and agn feedback @xcite and find that the addition of both of these effects can plausibly solve the problems encountered in the present simulations .",
    "thus , although the inclusion of all these feedback effects would certainly lower the overall total stellar masses in accordance with the observations , the relative contribution of in situ and accreted stellar mass might not be significantly affected and thus the general picture of a two - phased formation mechanism presented in this paper would remain valid",
    ". the next test of our cosmological two - phased formation scenario would be the inclusion of the aforementioned additional feedback sources in very high resolution zoom - in simulations of galaxies spanning a much wider range in both mass and environmental density , with the ultimate goal remaining the simultaneous production of fully realistic elliptical and disk galaxies in the same simulation .",
