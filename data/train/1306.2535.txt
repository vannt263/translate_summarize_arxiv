    "the theoretical description of the emission of coherently excited semiconductor materials on a consistent , quantum optical basis is a long - standing , daunting task . from the many body point of view",
    "the problem is to solve the coupled semiconductor bloch equations , which lead to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations .",
    "these equations are then truncated using cluster expansion techniques  @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite for luminescence from a quantum dot and  @xcite for luminescence of a quantum well . however , this method cuts off parts of the correlations , which are required to describe the quantum state of the light .",
    "another established ansatz is to apply nonequilibrium greens functions to solve the wave equations for the fields within the medium .",
    "this has proven efficient to compute the susceptibility ( optical response ) of the medium for excitation strengths up to the mott - transition , corresponding well to experimental results  @xcite . however , the emission spectra were not calculated within this approach .    in experiments on resonant rayleigh scattering ( rrs ) , the emission field of a semiconductor after",
    "resonant excitation has been studied  @xcite .",
    "there has also been considerable work on rrs of the speckle structure of localized excitons in quantum wells , see  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a long - distance interaction between exciton spots was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "however , for all these cases pumping was assumed very weak , and hence , only the coherent emission was considered .",
    "the incoherent emission spectra of the excitons were neglected . for the description of quantum optical properties of the fluorescent field ,",
    "the details about the incoherent emission are necessary .",
    "we will thus focus on the incoherent emission , in particular the emission spectra .",
    "an approach to combine the two descriptions of quantum fields and many body effects has led to a consistent formulation for the transmission of quantum fields through an excited material  @xcite .",
    "an input - output formalism was used to describe a scenario where light fields propagate through a preexcited slab geometry .",
    "the output field was shown to consist of a transmitted part from the input fields and the spontaneous emission of the excitons inside the material .",
    "however , a full quantum optical description of the fields originating from these quasiparticles is a persisting problem .    from a quantum optical point of view , a model hamiltonian for the internal excitations , the wannier - excitons , has to be proclaimed , which is solved to obtain the quantum light fields from such systems .",
    "for very low densities , excitons behave like bosons  @xcite , while in lowest order exciton - exciton interaction can be described by a kerr - nonlinearity  @xcite . on the other hand , localized excitons within quantum dots",
    "act like two - level atoms , emitting sub - poisson light  @xcite and showing strong light - matter coupling  @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a physical motivation for the model hamiltonian .",
    "yet , it does not directly include other electrons and holes and thus their effects on the light fields .    in this contribution",
    "we combine the concepts of quantum optical emission with the medium effects to interpret the fluorescence spectra of an excited gaas quantum well which has been studied experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we consider a bosonic multi - exciton model including exciton - exciton interaction described with a kerr - nonlinearity  @xcite . for multiple excitons in a small region as in the given experiments",
    ", we show the analogy to the single exciton scenario . using a simple model for the response of the medium and computing the optical emission , we obtain resonance fluorescence spectra matching the main features of the experiments : the asymmetric shape of the incoherent emission ; the magnitude of the resonance shift ; the decrease of the rayleigh peak for increasing laser intensity below the mott - transition .",
    "another important result is , that the emitted light is in a superfluorescent steady state .",
    "superfluorescence light is obtained from a system of multiple emitters , which couple coherently to the same mode of light  @xcite .",
    "thus the emitters produce a signal field , much more intense than the sum of a the single emitter fields .",
    "originally described for ensembles of atoms , it was later also predicted and shown in exciton systems , see  @xcite .",
    "likewise for very dense systems of excitons , cooperative emission under strong magnetic fields was observed  @xcite .",
    "there is also steady - state superfluorescence  @xcite , where the pump laser drives the ensemble into a collective , superradiative state .",
    "we develop a criterion for this kind of superfluorescent emission , apply it to the quantum well spectra and obtain clear evidence of superfluorescence .",

    "we provide evidence of the superfluorescent emission . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec.con ] we give some conclusions and an outlook .",
    "let us start with a short discussion of the performed experiments in order to formulate a model hamiltonian for the excitons .",
    "more details are given in  @xcite .",
    "the studied structure was created via molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "it incorporates multiple stacked gaas quantum wells with different well thicknesses and alternating alas - gaas layers in between to separate the active quantum films  @xcite .",
    "it was illuminated with a tunable single mode semiconductor cw laser ( linewidth 1 mhz ) source from a tilted angle .",
    "this allowed observing the emitted light with very high spatial resolution ( fwhm = 350 nm ) .",
    "resonance fluorescence emissions of different excitonic structures were analyzed both spatially and spectrally .",
    "the specially designed detection system covers a large solid angle of the surroundings of the probe and allows to collect a large portion of the fluorescence light .",
    "while multiple layers were analyzed , we will focus on one with a width of 19.8 nm , which was thoroughly studied in terms of the spatio - spectral properties .",
    "the spatially resolved fluorescence intensity has been recorded , see fig  [ fig.spatres ] .",
    "distributed over the large laser spot , we find localized excitonic structures , so called exciton spots ( ess ) .",
    "the localization of the ess stems from the surface roughness of the well  @xcite ; hence it is reproducible . with increasing temperature , these ess grow and combine to form larger spots .",
    "because of the limit in spatial resolution , the number of excitons within one such spot can not be determined with certainty .",
    "showing different ess at @xmath0 k for different optical frequencies @xmath1 .",
    "a : @xmath2 , b : @xmath3 @xmath4ev.,width=302 ]    single ess could be analyzed using a pinhole .",
    "each es behaves differently ( resonance frequency , linewidth , intensity etc . ) , whereas within one es , all excitons acquire a near identical state . notwithstanding this ,",
    "the qualitative behavior of different spots is observed to be the same .",
    "the optical spectra of the emitted light fields around the 1s resonance of the heavy - hole exciton of a single es are depicted for different laser intensities in fig .",
    "[ fig.exprf ] and discussed below .    for low laser intensities , additionally to a sharp rayleigh peak at the laser frequency ,",
    "a homogeneously broadened incoherent spectrum was observed .",
    "an ideal bosonic structure of the excitons only yields the rayleigh peak , not an incoherent spectrum , when irradiated with coherent light .",
    "hence , there must be a nonlinear contribution due to exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "however , in difference to two - level atoms  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite , no mollow - triplet arises .",
    "thus the excitons also do not behave like atoms in the case under study .        increasing the intensity , the exciton resonance shifts to a different frequency , with the direction of the shift depending on the sample temperature .",
    "this shift was discussed in  @xcite and interpreted on the basis of screening effects .",
    "it can be described within a model for the response of the medium via its susceptibility @xmath5 . at the same time",
    ", the rayleigh peak decreases with increasing intensity .",
    "an observed sideband at lower frequencies is assumed to be due to the biexciton  @xcite . for high pump intensities ,",
    "the mott - transition occurs , which is the main subject of the discussions in  @xcite . above the transition",
    "we only see a broad continuum due to the scattering of the electron - hole - plasma , while the rayleigh peak now increases again .",
    "with these results in mind we will now formulate a model hamiltonian as well as a master equation to describe the emitted fields for lower excitations ( below the mott - transition ) .",
    "as we work in the low density limit , we consider the excitons within one es as bosonic .",
    "based on the assumption of identical excitons within one es , we use the following reasonable approximations .",
    "all @xmath6 excitons of the spot are localized in a small spectral and spatial region , thus all have the same bare transition frequency @xmath7 , where already many - body induced shifts are supposed to be included . due to localization they have a negligible momentum .",
    "the exciting laser spot is much larger than the es size , such that every exciton is coupled to the laser field with the same rabi - frequency @xmath8 .",
    "likewise , also the kerr - nonlinearity , describing the exciton - exciton interaction , should have the same strength @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the excitons are described by bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and are driven by a cw - laser of frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the frame of @xmath13 reads as @xmath14 finally , each exciton emits light with the same emission rate @xmath15 .",
    "hence the full master equation for the density operator @xmath16 reads as @xmath17+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\mathcal l(\\hat\\varrho)\\\\ \\mathcal l(\\hat\\varrho)&=\\sum_n(2\\hat a_n\\hat\\varrho\\hat a^\\dagger_n-\\hat a^\\dagger_n\\hat a_n\\hat\\varrho-\\hat\\varrho\\hat a^\\dagger_n\\hat a_n).\\label{eq.master } \\end{split}\\ ] ] the second term is a standard form for the radiative decay  @xcite , here applied to the excitons . in the following , we will transform this hamiltonian into an effective hamiltonian describing a collective @xmath6-exciton - state .    as the size of the exciton spot is comparable to the optical wavelength , the relative phases @xmath18 have to be taken into account .",
    "we may define an overall average rabi frequency , @xmath19 by adjusting a global phase , we assume @xmath20 to be real and positive .",
    "for uncorrelated @xmath18-values , the emission from the individual excitons will interfere destructively , corresponding to a decrease of the average coupling @xmath20 per exciton . on the other hand ,",
    "if all excitons couple with the same phase @xmath21 , @xmath20 would be independent of @xmath6 and the excitons emit collectively in a superfluorescent state  @xcite .",
    "superfluorescence is per definition given , if the intensity of the field from @xmath6 emitters is proportional to @xmath22 , see  @xcite . for no phase matching , on the other hand",
    ", the intensity is proportional to @xmath6 .",

    "( [ eq.s - ham-2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the full cooperative dynamics of our system is identical to the single exciton case  but with modified coupling constants , depending on the number @xmath6 of excitons in the spot . note that @xmath15 and @xmath36 do not scale with @xmath6",
    "thus , the effects of multiple excitons only enhance the nonlinear contribution .",
    "broadening of the resulting linewidth is based on many - body effects .",
    "the collective rabi - frequency @xmath37 and the collective nonlinearity @xmath38 will be fit parameters of our simulation in sec .",
    "[ sec.in-out ] . hence",
    ", we use their dependence on @xmath6 to determine , if the emission of the excitons is superfluorescent .",

    "similar to this derivation , we can estimate the dynamics for a random configuration of excitons without phase matching . in this case",
    "we expect destructive interference suppressing a collective dipole coupling of the excitons to the pump field , which yields @xmath55 here we assumed a statistical distribution of the phase differences .",

    "( [ eq.superrel ] ) .",
    "in order to describe the fields emitted from the quantum well , we will apply the input - output formalism for a light field entering an excited , dispersing and absorbing , but otherwise passive medium  @xcite .",
    "the results of these methods will be reinterpreted for the case of fluorescence from a quantum film and connected to our above hamiltonian . following the huttner - barnett quantization of the maxwell equations in the presence of dispersing and absorbing bodies  @xcite , the noise inside the medium is generated by a system of harmonic oscillators , acting as noise sources .",
    "these noise sources were introduced in order to conserve the field commutation relation . in  @xcite it was shown , that a light field propagating through an excited semiconductor quantum well consists of a transmitted and a reflected part of the input field @xmath60 , and the spontaneous emission of the induced excitations .",
    "the latter , given by the noise operators , were shown to represent the excitons inside the medium . however , in all these cases , the noise operators were merely a bath . in the case of exciton fluorescence ,",
    "these excitations are driven themselves , so that their hamiltonian and dynamics must now be substituted with the above master - equation  ( [ eq.master-2 ] ) . furthermore",
    ", as the pumping light is the origin of the excitation of the quantum well , there is no ( further ) input signal .",
    "the emission spectrum reduces to the spontaneous emission of the medium - induced resonances , which can be given as @xmath61 herein , the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the fourier - transformed annihilation and creation operators of the induced resonances of the medium  the excitons and polaritons . hence , @xmath64 is identified as the emission spectrum of these quasiparticles .",

    "the emission spectrum is supposed to approach a bose distribution  @xcite , which is in accordance with the above discussion on the noise operators of huttner and barnett . as absorption and emission",
    "are both accessible to experiments , it was proposed to test an excited semiconductor for quasi - equilibrium .",
    "however , such experiments , performed on znse  @xcite , indicated `` that the detected emission comes from the polariton states excited by the pump pulse , rather than from a quasi - equilibrium distribution . '' consequently , we apply the different interpretation of using the dynamics from eq .",

    "the emission spectrum of the quasiparticles is simply the wiener - khintchine spectrum , @xmath69 obtained from the fourier - transform of the two - time correlation function .",
    "the wiener - khintchine spectrum can be calculated from our collective bosonic operators @xmath27 via the quantum regression theorem , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "however , the slow increase of the detuning @xmath36 with increasing laser powers yields two conclusions : on one hand the majority of the shift is based on the detuning of the laser from the absorption resonance , not on many - body effects . on the other hand",
