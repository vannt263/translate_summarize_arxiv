    "in 1976 t hooft [ 1 ] observed that the standard model does not absolutely conserve baryon and lepton number due to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly . in particular",

    "fermion number violating tunnelling transitions between topologically distinct vacua might become observable at future accelerators [ 2,3 ] .",
    "manton [ 4 ] considered the possibility of fermion number violation in the standard model from another point of view .",
    "investigating the topological structure of the configuration space of the weinberg - salam theory , manton showed that there are non - contractible loops in configuration space , and predicted the existence of a static , unstable solution of the field equations , a sphaleron with chern - simons charge @xmath0 [ 5 ] , representing the top of the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua .    at finite temperature",
    "this energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations of the fields , and fermion number violating vacuum to vacuum transitions involving changes of baryon and lepton number can occur .",
    "baryon number violation in the standard model due to thermal transitions over the barrier may be relevant for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe [ 6 - 10 ] .",
    "the change of fermion number during a vacuum to vacuum transition over the barrier is associated with the level crossing of one fermionic mode .",
    "a fermionic eigenstate emerges from the continuum of positive energy states , crosses zero energy and dives into the dirac sea of negative energy states .    while it has been known since some time , that the fermions possess a zero mode in the background field of the sphaleron [ 11 - 13 ] , the level crossing phenomenon in the background field of the sphaleron barrier was only demonstrated recently , for fermion doublets degenerate in mass , moderate values of the higgs mass and vanishing mixing angle [ 14 - 16 ] .    for large values of the higgs mass",
    "the barrier separating topologically distinct vacua becomes asymmetric , the top of the barrier being now represented by a bisphaleron with chern - simons charge @xmath1 [ 17,18 ] .",
    "here we demonstrate the level crossing phenomenon for fermions in the background field of such asymmetric barriers for large values of the higgs mass .",
    "we numerically determine the fermion eigenvalues along various paths from one vacuum to another , passing a bisphaleron .",
    "in particular we consider the extremal energy path [ 19 ] , which however becomes unsatisfactory for large values of the higgs mass [ 20 ] , and construct improved paths .",
    "we again assume that the fermions of a doublet are degenerate in mass .",
    "this assumption , violated in the standard model , allows for spherically symmetric anstze for all of the fields , when the mixing angle dependence is neglected ( which is an excellent approximation [ 21,22 ] ) .",

    "the non - contractible loop constructed by manton [ 4 ] ( see also [ 25 ] ) is symmetric under parity and its energy culminates at the sphaleron .",
    "it is therefore not appropriate for large higgs masses , where the first bisphaleron represents the top of the energy barrier .",
    "a loop reaching its maximal energy at the bisphaleron was constructed by klinkhamer [ 25 ] .    a systematic technique to numerically construct an extremal path over the barrier is provided by the functional @xmath83 where the chern - simons charge is added to the energy functional by means of the lagrange multiplier @xmath84 [ 19 ] . for @xmath85 this functional yields the sphaleron and the bisphalerons ,",

    "however , for large values of the higgs mass ( @xmath91 ) the extremal energy path obtained from the functional @xmath87 fails to be satisfactory in the neighborhood of the bisphaleron , due to the occurrence of a catastrophe [ 20 ] . as demonstrated in figs .",

    "the catastrophes present along the extremal path are reflected in the behaviour of the fermion eigenvalue , and there is a strong dependence on the fermion mass . at the two critical points , where the energy reaches a spike as a function of the chern - simons number , the fermion eigenvalue bends around , having an infinite derivative , provided that the fermion mass is large enough so that fermion bound states still exist in this region of @xmath106 .    for light fermions",
    "bound states exist only in a narrow region around @xmath90 , and we observe three distinct branches , illustrated in fig .",
    "6a for @xmath147 gev .",
    "moving along the extremal path , a first branch starts from the positive continuum , passes zero and dives into the negative continuum .",
    "then a second branch starts from the negative continuuum passes zero at the sphaleron and dives into the positive continuum .",
    "finally a third branch starts from the positive continuum , passes zero and dives into the negative continuum .",
    "thus three zero modes occur along the full extremal path , but since these modes are encountered from alternating directions , the total change in fermion number is the same as for a single level crossing .    for heavier fermions ,",
    "when bound states exist also at the values of @xmath106 , where the spikes are encountered , the fermion eigenvalue starts from the positive continuum , crosses zero , and bends backward and upward at the first spike . then it crosses zero again at the sphaleron , reaches the second spike and bends forward and downward , to cross zero for the third time and finally reach the negative continuum .",

    "here the eigenvalue decreases monotonically from the positive continuum to the negative continuum as a function of @xmath106 , passing zero only once .",
    "let us now consider how the fermion eigenvalue along the improved path depends on the fermion mass .",
    "it is instructive to first inspect the critical values of the fermion mass @xmath142 , where the bound state enters the continuum along the extremal path , since to a large extend the extremal path coincides with the improved path , eqs .",

    "the critical values of the fermion mass are illustrated in fig .  7 for @xmath146 .",

    "of course the precise point along the path , where the zero mode is encountered , depends on the specific choice of the improved path , except when the zero mode occurs in the bisphaleron background field .",
    "analogous considerations hold for the parity conjugate path , passing the parity conjugate bisphaleron .",
    "we have demonstrated the level crossing phenomenon along the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua for large higgs masses , when the barrier is no longer symmetric .    we have employed various approximations in this study . to keep spherical symmetry , we have neglected the finite mixing angle and the mass splitting within the fermion doublet .",
    "while the mixing angle dependence is small [ 21,22 ] , the effect of the fermion mass splitting on the fermion modes certainly needs further investigation .",
    "we have also only treated the valence fermion .",
    "the inclusion of the dirac sea has been studied by diakonov et al . [ 16 ] ( for small higgs masses ) , showing only a small effect for light fermions , but an important contribution for heavy fermions .",
    "we have further neglected the back reaction of the fermions on the barrier , which has been considered in [ 15 ] ( for small higgs masses ) , showing again that the effect is important only for heavy fermions , when the barrier becomes asymmetric even for small higgs masses .    for large higgs masses , when @xmath91 , there are two parity conjugate barriers , and the configurations representing the top of these barriers are the two conjugate first bisphalerons .",
    "we have considered various paths over these barriers , passing a bisphaleron .",
    "the extremal path [ 19 ] is not satisfactory for these large higgs masses , since it is parity symmetric , passing besides both bisphalerons also the sphaleron , with catastrophes in the vicinity of the bisphalerons .",
    "therefore we have constructed an improved path involving the single negative mode of the bisphaleron .",
    "this improved path is smooth and culminates at the bisphaleron .    solving the fermion eigenvalue equations in the background field of the bisphaleron , we observe , that the fermion eigenvalue depends on both the fermion mass and on the higgs mass",
    "this is in contrast to the sphaleron , which has a fermion zero mode for all fermion masses and higgs masses . for a given higgs mass",
    "there is only one particular value of the fermion mass , where the bisphaleron supports a zero eigenvalue .",
    "interestingly , this fermion mass depends only very slightly on the higgs mass .    in the background field of the extremal path",
    "the fermion eigenvalue reflects the catastrophic behaviour of the extremal path . for small fermion masses , @xmath157 gev , there are three zero modes encountered from alternating directions , while for larger fermion masses there is only one zero mode encountered at the sphaleron .",
    "in contrast , along the smooth improved path the fermion eigenvalue is also smooth and only a single zero mode is encountered for all fermion masses .",
