    "the exquisite photometric precision of the _ kepler _ mission has led , among many other things , to the discovery of two systems in which a hot white dwarf both transits its parent star , and is eclipsed by it ( rowe et al.2010 ; van kerkwijk et al.2010 ) . in the case of koi-74 , the relative transit and eclipse depths are only @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , while the amplitudes of the ellipsoidal light variations and doppler boosting effect have even more remarkably small amplitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "such small effects are unexplored with ground - based astronomy .",
    "the discovery of transiting / eclipsing white dwarfs which exhibit the effects mentioned above are amenable to many interesting system diagnostics , and can thereby be potentially very revealing about the binary stellar evolution that has led to their current configuration ( e.g. , van kerkwijk et al.2010 ; di stefano 2010 ) .",
    "in particular , if the progenitor of the white dwarf was initially of mass @xmath14 the orbital period may be tightly correlated with the white dwarf mass ( e.g. , rappaport et al.1995 ) . in all cases where the current - epoch binary orbital period is short ( e.g. , less than a month ) the system",
    "almost certainly involved a phase of mass transfer from the progenitor of the white dwarf to what is presently the normal stellar companion . in the process",
    ", a substantial amount of the original primary mass was transferred to its companion or lost from the system .",
    "the temperature of the white dwarf provides some important information on the cooling history and the age since the mass transfer event ( see , e.g. , van kerkwijk et al.2010 ; di stefano 2010 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we report the discovery of a third hot white dwarf ( with @xmath9 k ) orbiting an a star , which we herein designate as `` khwd3 '' .",
    "the star , kic 10657664 , was identified and catalogued by prsa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in the _ kepler _ binary star catalog , although it was not identified as harboring a hot white dwarf companion .",
    "its transit and eclipse depths are about an order of magnitude larger than those of koi-74 and koi-81 , due mostly to the fact that the radius of the white dwarf in khwd3 is a factor of @xmath153 times larger than in the systems discovered earlier .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we present the _ kepler _ light curve for this system , and the analyses which yield the flux ratio of the two stars , the ratio of their radii , the orbital inclination angle , and the first three harmonics of the light curve which reveal ellipsoidal light variations , an illumination effect , and doppler boosting . in ",
    "3 we determine the model - independent parameters of the binary system including the mass , effective temperature , radius , and luminosity of the white dwarf , and the mass ratio .",
    "inferences about the properties of the primary star allow us to estimate its mass at @xmath16 . from this estimate and the measured mass ratio",
    "we arrive in  4 at two possible solutions for the mass of the white dwarf : either @xmath6 or @xmath17 , depending on whether we emphasize in our analysis the ellipsoidal light variations or the doppler boosting effect . in  5 we discuss various evolutionary scenarios that can lead to the present system .",
    "we modeled the eclipse events assuming two spherical stars having radius ratio @xmath18 , and observed flux ratio @xmath19 , assigning the indices of 1 and 2 to primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "the binary was constrained to a keplerian orbit parameterized by a period @xmath20 , a normalized semi - major axis distance @xmath21 , an inclination to the sky plane @xmath22 , an eccentricity @xmath23 , an argument of periastron @xmath24 and a time of inferior conjunction ( i.e. , at the time of the eclipse of the primary ) , @xmath25 .",

    "we fixed the quadratic limb darkening coefficient of the primary to @xmath52 , as would be expected ( according to sing 2010 ) for a star observed in the _ kepler _ bandpass and having the stellar parameters @xmath53 k , @xmath54 and @xmath55=-0.10 $ ] as determined for khwd3 and tabulated in the _ kepler _ input catalog .",
    "we adopted a linear limb darkening model for the secondary by fixing the quadratic term @xmath56 to zero ; the inclusion of this degree of freedom had little effect on the results but was added for completeness .    the continuously defined model , @xmath47 , was numerically integrated before being compared with the long cadence _ kepler",

    ", we determined @xmath58 by increasing its value until the goodness - of - fit statistic ( defined below ) plateaued .",
    "we settled upon @xmath65 for any @xmath57 within @xmath66 hr of an eclipse or transit and @xmath67 elsewhere .",
    "we determined the best fit model to the data by minimizing the @xmath68 goodness - of - fit statistic , defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the measured flux at time @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the expected statistical error in the flux measurements .",
    "we selected @xmath73  ppm such that the reduced @xmath68 was unity for the best fit solution .",
    "the solid curves in figures  [ fig : lc ] ,  [ fig : elc ] , and [ fig : var ] trace the best fit solutions to the data .",
    "we determined the posterior probability distributions for the fitted parameters by employing a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm . with the mcmc algorithm , first",
    ", a randomly chosen parameter is perturbed by an amount drawn from a normal distribution of some fixed width .",
    "next , this new parameter and the remaining unperturbed parameters are used to compute @xmath68 [ as defined in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) ] to determine a likelihood @xmath74 .",
    "the new parameter is `` accepted '' according to a metropolis - hasting jump condition : if the likelihood @xmath75 is greater than the unperturbed likelihood @xmath76 then the perturbation is accepted , otherwise it is accepted with a probability of @xmath77 . after many perturbations , the resulting `` chain '' of accepted parameters samples the desired joint posterior probability distribution . for a more detailed introduction to the mcmc algorithm , refer to the appendix of the work by tegmark et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    we generated",
    "a chain of @xmath78 links , having selected perturbation widths such that @xmath79 of jumps were accepted .",
    "the chain was checked for adequate mixing and convergence by visual inspection , and by observing that the number of links was much larger than the autocorrelation length ( equal to the number of links at which the chain autocorrelation drops below one half ) for any selected parameter .",
    "we report , in table  [ tab : phot ] , the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 values ( corresponding to the median and @xmath83sigma values ) of the cumulative distribution for each parameter , marginalizing over the remaining parameters .",
    "in the upper - left corner of figure  [ fig : dist ] , we show the joint distributions for the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath49 to demonstrate their correlations .",
    "the remaining parameters , including the harmonic function amplitudes , were weakly correlated with other parameters .",
    "we measured amplitudes ( being significantly different from zero ) for , in order of decreasing amplitude , the @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 modes of the out - of - eclipse variation . repeating the above analysis including only an integral number of orbital cycles did not modify these results .",
    "the four largest modes are plotted individually for comparison in figure  [ fig : var ] .",
    "the fitted values of the 6 harmonic amplitudes are summarized in table 1 .    in  3 , we associate these modes with three possible physical effects and describe an analysis used to determine additional system parameters ( such as the mass ratio @xmath5 ) , assuming the validity of these associations .",
    "_ correlated noise _  we have assumed a `` white '' noise spectrum in both our best - fit and mcmc analyses .",
    "however , we note that correlated noise could have a significant affect on our estimates of harmonic content . to investigate this possibility further , we completed a secondary analysis , as follows , whereby we determined what we consider to be the most conservative errors on these amplitudes .",
    "we first corrected for the low - frequency trend by dividing the data by the best - fit estimate for @xmath89 .",
    "then , having fixed the best - fit estimates for the eclipse parameters , we fit a unique harmonic model to each individual cycle ( i.e. , by using only the data from one primary transit to the next ) .",
    "we then determined the mean amplitude , for each mode , and the standard deviation in that mean averaging over the 12 available cycles .",
    "we found that the scatter across all cycles , in a given harmonic amplitude , was consistent with random noise ( i.e. , no minority of cycles was significantly biasing the mean ) .",
    "the means across all modes agree with the mcmc - determined amplitude medians within the mcmc - determined errors .",
    "the standard deviations in the means were larger , as may be expected in the presence of correlated noise , than the amplitude uncertainties determined via mcmc .",
    "however , only the @xmath90 and @xmath91 modes have substantially higher uncertainties , with each being roughly twice as large as the mcmc estimates . these inflated , and likely overestimated , errors translate into a @xmath92 correction in the _ uncertainty _ in the secondary mass estimate ( as determined in  3 ) .",
    "all other system parameters were less significantly affected .",
    "we therefore decided to use the mcmc error estimates in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we also report a weak detection of eccentricity for this system , having measured a non - zero value for @xmath93 as inferred from the @xmath94 minute delay ( relative to the circular orbit expectation ) of the start of secondary eclipse .",
    "we note that we did not account for delays as a result of the finite speed of light crossing the orbit ; however , given the estimated separation of the binary ( see  3 ) , we expect light travel time delays of @xmath95 seconds .",
    "this correction corresponds to an error in @xmath96 that is smaller than the estimated statistical error . in  3.6.1 , we comment on the consequences of a non - zero eccentricity in the interpretation of the harmonic modes of the out - of - eclipse light curve .",

    "if we assume the primary is on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , then we may utilize the approximate formula by eggleton ( 2006 ) to estimate its mass as a function of either effective temperature or density . picking the former to be in the range 9000",

    "however , in this regard , we would have surmised that the simple , classical , analytic models for these effects should work even better at these smaller amplitudes than at larger amplitudes .",
    "it is also possible that there are some additional , heretofore unexplained , physical effects which complement the harmonic content that we have not attempted to model , e.g. the oconnell effect ( see , for example , davidge & milone 1984 ) .",

    "we have assumed synchronous rotation between the primary , secondary , and orbit when calculating the contribution to the harmonic content from elv or ill ( as described in  3.1 ) .",
    "should the primary be rotating at a different rate from the orbital frequency , frictional drag within the primary may force the tidal distortion due to the secondary to lag or lead the orbit ( as is the case with the tides imposed on earth by the moon ) .",
    "the illumination effect may also lag or lead as a result of both the modified phase variation of the sky - projected cross - sectional area and additionally , depending on the depth in the stellar atmosphere at which radiant energy from the secondary is deposited , from a `` hot spot '' that is shifted from the substellar point .    to investigate this possibility further , we carried out an analysis where we assumed that both the elv and ill effects are shifted by a common variable phase from their nominal circulation .",
    "db is independent of the assumption of synchrony and was not permitted a phase shift . given this additional degree of freedom , we find that we may account for the measured values of all harmonic amplitudes including the relatively large , and previously unexplained , @xmath87 mode .",

    "the amplitude of this effect depends on the size and flux contrast , relative to the unspotted photosphere , of the spot .",
    "while spots in tidally locked binaries may persist for months , it is unlikely that an a star lacking a substantial convective outer envelope would exhibit significant spotting behavior ( strassmeier 2009 ) .",
    "a possible exception would be a magnetically active a star ( e.g. , a `` peculiar '' or ap star ; see kochukhov ( 2010 ) and references therein ) .",
    "* rapid rotation of the primary  in the previous section , we discussed possible phase lags in the elv and ill effects as a result of non - synchronous rotation .",
    "in addition , the primary may be significantly oblate as a result of very fast rotation .",
    "in this case , @xmath21 as inferred in the light curve analysis may be different from the true normalized semi - major axis .",
    "in particular , if the spin axes of the rapidly rotating primary and the orbit are aligned , then @xmath21 would likely be overestimated ( barnes 2009 ) .",
    "additionally , very fast rotation may induce an unexpected stellar brightness profile as a result of strong gravity darkening ; both the inferred radius ratio , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 may be inaccurate as result ( barnes 2009 ) .",
    "however , given the short orbital period of 3.3 days , it is most likely that the orbit and the primary star have already synchronized ( see , e.g. , torres , andersen , & gimenez 2010 ) .",
    "it should be noted that a smaller value for @xmath21 , closer to 6.2 than its current estimate of @xmath231 , would resolve the discrepancy between elv and db amplitudes for @xmath232 @xmath1 . if this lower value where accurate , then @xmath233 , as would be estimated using the db amplitude alone .",

    "additionally , the inverse correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath21 ( see fig .  4 ) suggests a relatively _ larger _ white dwarf radius for a smaller @xmath21 .",

    "4 ) , small errors , model inaccuracies , or non - uniform data sampling may lead to systematically inaccurate values for @xmath21 that vary greatly in an absolute sense .",
    "we remark that the @xmath240 data points occurring during the ingress or egress phases of the secondary eclipse carry the overwhelming majority of the statistical weight in determining @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath236 .",
    "while the mcmc algorithm (  2.2 ) will likely yield a robust measure of parameter precision and correlation , the accuracy of the most - likely value is affected by correlated noise and the ( sparse ) distribution of data points during eclipse ingress or egress .",
    "compiling future _ kepler _ data for khwd3 will most likely resolve any current statistical biases .",
    "recall from  3 that , depending on whether our analysis emphasized the elv and illumination amplitudes or the doppler boosting and illumination amplitudes , we find that @xmath237 or @xmath238 , respectively ( see  3 for details ) . for each of these values of @xmath5 , we would infer a white dwarf mass of @xmath239 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we discuss the consequences of these values for the binary stellar evolution of the system in the next section .",
    "the presence of a white dwarf in khwd3 , coupled with the short orbital period ( 3.273 days ) , indicate that there was necessarily a phase of mass transfer / loss during the prior evolution of this binary .",
    "one obvious constraint on the primordial binary is that it must have had a total mass , @xmath240 , equal to at least the current mass of the binary @xmath241 , where @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the initial masses of the primordial primary ( the white dwarf progenitor ) and the secondary , respectively . as is readily evident , and we explore below , this implies that the mass of the primordial primary was greater than @xmath244 , and therefore had a radiative envelope at the time when mass transfer to the primordial secondary commenced . in turn",
    ", this indicates that the mass transfer from the primary to the secondary took place , at least initially , on a thermal timescale .",
    "given the two different possible masses for the white dwarf ( see  4 ) , there are two slightly different evolutionary scenarios for the formation of the white dwarf .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn .",
    "even if the donor star is more massive than the accretor , the mass transfer can still proceed quite stably if the donor has a radiative envelope .",
    "the mass ratio of the primordial progenitor binary , @xmath246 , up to which the mass transfer is stable , depends on the masses and the orbital period when mass transfer commences , but can exceed @xmath247 . for stars with initial mass @xmath248 , a degenerate he core develops and there is a nearly unique relation between the radius of the evolving star and the core mass .",
    "this leads to a tight relation between the mass of the remnant white dwarf , once the envelope of the primary has been completely transferred to the secondary and/or lost from the system , and the orbital period : @xmath249 where @xmath250 is in units of @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , rappaport et al.1995 ; ergma 1996 ; tauris & savonije 1999 ; lin et al.2010 ) .",
    "if we solve this non - linear equation for the value of @xmath250 that matches the current orbital period of 3.273 days , we find : @xmath251 where the estimate in @xmath250 is uncertain by @xmath210% ( rappaport et al.1995 ) .",
    "this mass range is marginally consistent with the lower of the two possible masses measured for the white dwarf in khwd3 ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "another major issue that needs to be addressed regarding the white dwarf is how to explain its large radius ( @xmath253 ) and high effective temperature ( @xmath254 k ) . in particular , the radius is approximately @xmath255@xmath256 times the radius of a degenerate he star of the same mass . according to cooling models of he white dwarfs formed in an analogous manner ( i.e. , after losing its envelope to a companion star ; hansen & phinney 1998 ; nelson , dubeau , & maccannell 2004 ; ph.podsiadlowski , private communication 2010 ) the radius can remain this bloated for a considerable period of time for very low - mass white dwarfs . the degree to which this is possible depends on the amount of residual h - rich atmosphere the core retains after losing its envelope .",
    "in particular , a he white dwarf of 0.21 @xmath1 with a h - rich atmosphere of 0.01 @xmath1 can remain this large and hot for @xmath2150 myr , while a 0.19 @xmath1 he dwarf with a similar h - rich atmosphere can remain thermally bloated and hot for up to 300 myr . even in the case of 0.21 @xmath1 white dwarf",
    ", 150 myr is a non - negligible fraction of the nuclear evolution time of the @xmath2@xmath257 parent star .",
    "degenerate he white dwarfs with masses @xmath258 would not remain hot and thermally bloated for nearly long enough to have a plausible probability of catching them in such a state . therefore , the lower limit of the measured range of @xmath252 would be strongly preferred in this scenario .",
    "stars with mass @xmath260 do not evolve with degenerate cores and their radius does not follow the radius  core mass relation discussed above . in a close binary system ,",
    "such stars are less likely to produce a remnant he core with a mass as low as @xmath20.19 - 0.22 @xmath1 .",
    "however , they could produce a white dwarf that matches the more massive of our allowed solutions , namely @xmath2@xmath7 .",
    "such non - degenerate he stars , once the envelope of the primordial primary has been removed , would be on the he - burning main sequence ( as long as @xmath261 ) , and they could be quite luminous .",
    "an analytic fitting function for the luminosity of naked he burning stars is : @xmath262 ( hurley , pols , & tout 2000 ; hereafter `` hpt '' ) .",
    "the observed luminosity of the white dwarf in khwd3 is @xmath263 .",
    "the he star mass that corresponds to this luminosity , according to the above fitting formula , is down near the end of the he - burning main sequence with @xmath264 .",
    "the radius and effective temperature of such a he burning star would be @xmath2@xmath265 and @xmath226,000 k , respectively ( hpt ) .",
    "the corresponding measured radius and effective temperature of the hot white dwarf in khwd3 is about 2.5 times larger in radius , and about half as high in temperature .",
    "this could be nicely accommodated ( and produce roughly the same luminosity ) if the he star has a modest residual hydrogen - rich atmosphere ( i.e. , @xmath266 ; see han et al.2002 ; han et al.2003 ) .",
    "the nuclear lifetime of such a he - burning star , i.e. , near the end of the he - burning main sequence , is @xmath2@xmath267 yr .",
    "such a star would be at the low - mass end of what are known as subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars ( see , e.g. , han et al.2003 , their figures 15 and 17 ) .",
    "we note that unstable mass transfer leading to the current system probably could not have resulted in a common envelope ( `` ce '' ) phase leading to the successful ejection of the ce .",
    "the ejection of a common envelope around such a low - mass core would have resulted in a post - ce orbital period that is considerably shorter than 3 days . the only way in which a 3-day post - ce binary would ensue is if the pre - ce orbital period were extremely long  in which case the white dwarf mass would be much higher than is observed . for an impressive study of such post common - envelope systems",
    "see the work by parsons et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "we explore here what the range of possible and likely parameters the primordial progenitor binary could have been .",
    "we know three independent binary parameters of the current system : @xmath136 , @xmath139 , and @xmath269 . the appropriate application of conservation of mass and angular momentum yield two constraints  insufficient to uniquely identify , by themselves , the initial system parameters .",
    "however , there are two other constraints , discussed here , that are sufficient to define a relatively narrow range in parameter space for the primordial binary .    as mass",
    "is transferred from the primary to the secondary , a fraction of it , @xmath270 , will be retained by the secondary , and the remainder will be lost from the system .",
    "the ejected mass will carry away an average specific angular momentum which we denote as @xmath120 which is in units of the specific angular momentum of the binary .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know _ a priori _ either @xmath120 or @xmath270 , but we can make an educated guess about the former . in terms of the quantities",
    "we have already defined earlier , we can write the mass retention fraction as : @xmath271 conservation of angular momentum then yields a relation between the orbital periods before ( @xmath272 ) and after ( @xmath273 ) the mass transfer phase : @xmath274 where the powers , @xmath275 and @xmath276 are defined as @xmath277 ( see , podsiadlowski et al.1992 ; rappaport , podsiadlowski , & horev 2009 ) . in the scenario",
    "discussed above for forming a white dwarf of mass @xmath20.25 @xmath1 , we can constrain @xmath272 to be shorter than @xmath278 . in the case",
    "where a more massive white dwarf formed from a primary star with @xmath279 , the initial orbital period could , in principle have been longer than 3.273 days , and the orbit could have subsequently shrunk during mass transfer . however , for substantially longer initial @xmath269 , the core mass would likely exceed @xmath20.4 @xmath1 .",
    "another constraint that we can impose is that the initial orbital separation should be large enough so that not only can both the primordial primary and secondary fit within their respective roche lobes , but that there is sufficient room for the primary to evolve a substantial he core before the mass transfer commences .",
    "this constraint can be written as : @xmath280^{1/3 } \\left(\\frac{p_i}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{2/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath281 is the fraction of its roche lobe that is filled by the primordial primary of radius @xmath282 ; @xmath283 is the ratio of the roche - lobe radius to orbital separation , @xmath142 , which depends only on the mass ratio , @xmath5 ; and @xmath272 is the orbital period before the mass transfer commences .",
    "we take as a somewhat arbitrary but quite reasonable constraint : @xmath284 .",
    "a final constraint is the ratio of the thermal and nuclear timescales of the primary to those of the secondary .",
    "we have shown ( rappaport et al.2009 ) that these both scale roughly as @xmath285 we require that this ratio be smaller than @xmath20.6 so that , while the original primary evolved , the secondary ( the current primary ) did not evolve substantially off the main sequence by the current epoch .",
    "on the other hand , we simultaneously require that this ratio be larger than about 0.2 so that the thermal timescales of the two primordial stars not be too dissimilar . if they were very different , then it is likely that the mass transfer would have become dynamically unstable . in summary",
    ", we require that @xmath286 .    we adopt a nominal value for the specific angular momentum loss parameter , @xmath287 ; however , we also consider values of @xmath288 and 1.5 .",
    "this is a reasonable set of bounds since , for example , the specific angular momentum parameter , @xmath120 , at the @xmath289 point where matter is likely to escape from the binary system , ranges from 1.08 to 1.56 for a mass ratio covering the rather wide range of @xmath290 .    when we combine the constraints imposed by conservation of mass , angular momentum , ratio of timescales , and initial roche - lobe filling factors we find an acceptable region in initial parameter space that is shown in fig.[fig : regions ] .",
    "we end our discussion of the prior evolutionary history of khwd3 by comparing this system with three other white dwarfs in close binaries that also likely formed during a phase of stable roche - lobe mass transfer .",
    "these are koi-74 , koi-81 , and regulus with white dwarfs in orbital periods of 5.3 days , 23 days , and 40 days , respectively ( rowe et al.1010 ; van kerkwijk et al.2010 ; gies et al.2008 ; rappaport et al.2009 ) .",
    "the measured white dwarf masses in these systems are @xmath291 , @xmath20.3 , and @xmath292 @xmath1 . including the lower - mass solution for khwd3 ( i.e. , @xmath252 )",
    ", we find a modestly significant correlation between masses and increasing @xmath269 .",
    "this correlation is plotted in fig.[fig : hwd ] where the solid curve is the theoretically expected relation for progenitor stars of mass @xmath14 ( see eq.29 above ) .",
    "the white dwarf masses are not very well determined , and there is only a small spread in all their masses by a factor of @xmath21.5 . nonetheless , given the extremely steep theoretical dependence of @xmath269 on the mass of the white dwarf , the known systems are roughly consistent with this relation .",
    "more such systems , with even better determined white dwarf masses , will be needed in order to supplement the kind of information currently being provided by radio pulsar systems ( rappaport et al.1995 ; tauris 1998 ; thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "in this work we have utilized public _ kepler _ data to identify and study in detail a third hot white dwarf in a close binary orbit .",
    "the system is formally known as kic 10657664 , and we have given it the shorthand name `` khwd3 '' .",
    "the system is comprised of a white dwarf with @xmath9 k orbiting an a star of mass @xmath22.3 @xmath1 .",
    "the white dwarf is extremely thermally bloated with a radius of @xmath293 , some @xmath294 times larger than its degenerate radius .",
    "we have combined the transit and eclipse data as well as the low - amplitude , out - of - transit / eclipse light curve to infer all the system parameters .",
    "the large size of the white dwarf , coupled with its high effective temperature , produces relatively large eclipse and transit depths ( @xmath22% and 0.7% , respectively ) .",
    "the out - of - transit / eclipse periodic light curves are of much smaller amplitude ( in the range of @xmath2@xmath295 parts per @xmath215 ) and are interpreted as being due to doppler boosting , mutual illumination , and ellipsoidal light variations ( due to tidal distortions ) .",
    "the deduced system parameters are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the only ambiguity in the determination of the system parameters lies in the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "our analysis leads to two somewhat distinct , and currently unresolvable , possible solutions : @xmath252 or @xmath7 .",
    "the difficulty in distinguishing between these two possibilities for the white dwarf mass lies in the fact that both the doppler effect and the elv both basically determine the mass ratio , and these two amplitudes in the light curve produce somewhat inconsistent results in this ratio ( at the @xmath22.8 @xmath72 level ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that the remainder of the important system parameters are well determined , in spite of this particular ambiguity .",
    "we have also briefly explored what the possible progenitors of this system might have been .",
    "the system almost certainly formed after a phase of mass transfer from the primordial primary star ( now the white dwarf ) to the secondary star ( now the a star primary of the system ) .",
    "if the primordial primary had a mass less than @xmath22.2 @xmath1 , its core mass would directly determine the final orbital period ( 3.273 days ) , which predicts the current white dwarf mass to be @xmath296 , in modest agreement with the lower of our two solutions .",
    "such a low - mass white dwarf ( i.e. , @xmath297 ) could remain hot and bloated for a substantial fraction ( i.e. , @xmath15 10% ) of the lifetime of the current primary a star .",
    "if the primordial primary had a mass @xmath298 , then it is likely that our solution for a more massive white dwarf is the correct one . in this case , however , the white dwarf would almost certainly be undergoing nuclear burning at the current epoch .",
    "this , in turn , would imply that the mass would have to be low ( @xmath299 ) , i.e. , near the end of the he - burning main sequence , in order to explain a luminosity of @xmath300 .",
    "likely primordial stars of mass @xmath301 and @xmath302 ( see fig.[fig : regions ] ) would imply a highly non - conservative phase of mass transfer with perhaps half the transferred mass being lost from the system .",
    "for this particular set of illustrative primordial binary masses , the mass ratio is sufficiently large to possibly explain the high mass loss rate . we have compared khwd3 with the two other hot white dwarfs discovered with _",
    "kepler _ as well as the regulus system .",
    "the initial system masses for regulus ( see rappaport et al.2009 ) were @xmath303 and @xmath304 , which are seemingly not too different than for khwd3 . however , the final orbital period of the white dwarf in the regulus system is 40 days , which is considerably longer than the 3.3-day period of khwd3 .",
    "the difference likely lies in the fact that in the regulus system the mass transfer was considerably more conservative ( leading to a much wider orbit ; see eqn.33 ) .",
    "this is quite plausible given that the initial mass ratio of @xmath21.2 for regulus was significantly closer to unity than for khwd3 which may have been closer to @xmath21.6 .",

    "<S> we have found a system listed in the _ kepler _ binary catalog ( @xmath0 days ; prsa et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2010 ) that we have determined is comprised of a low - mass , thermally - bloated , hot white dwarf orbiting an a star of about 2.3 @xmath1 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we designate the object , kic 10657664 , simply as  khwd3  </S>",
    "<S> ( `` kepler hot white dwarf 3 '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the transit depth of @xmath20.66% , the eclipse depth of @xmath21.9% , and regular smooth periodic variations at the orbital frequency and twice the orbital frequency to analyze the system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the smooth periodic variations are identified with the classical ellipsoidal light variation ( `` elv '' ) and illumination ( `` ill '' ) effects , and the newly utilized doppler boosting ( `` db '' ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> given the measured values of @xmath3 and inclination angle of the binary , both the elv and db effects are mostly sensitive to the mass ratio , @xmath4 , of the binary . </S>",
    "<S> the two effects yield values of @xmath5 which are somewhat inconsistent  presumably due to unidentified systematic effects  but which nonetheless provide a quite useful set of possibilities for the mass of the white dwarf ( either @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of the other system parameters are determined fairly robustly . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the white dwarf has a radius of @xmath8 which is extremely bloated over the radius it would have as a fully degenerate object , and an effective temperature @xmath9 k. binary evolution scenarios and models for this system are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the progenitor binary was comprised of a primary of mass @xmath22.2 @xmath1 ( the progenitor of the current hot white dwarf ) and a secondary of mass @xmath21.4 @xmath1 ( the progenitor of the current a star in the system ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this new system with three other white dwarfs in binaries that likely were formed via stable roche - lobe overflow ( koi-74 , koi-81 , and the inner regulus binary ) . </S>"
