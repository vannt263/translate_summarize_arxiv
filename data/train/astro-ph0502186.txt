    "since the discovery of the cosmological distance scale to gamma ray bursts in 1997 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) several grb redshifts have been spectroscopically measuredjcg / grbgen.html for a continuously updated table . ] . the small sample of bursts , now comprising 42 events , allowed in the latest years the investigation of the grb rest frame properties .",
    "several correlations have been discovered between grbs spectral properties :    1 .   the spectral lag - luminosity correlation @xmath4@xmath5 ( norris , marani & bonnel 2000 ; norris 2002 ) 2 .   the variability - luminosity correlation @xmath6@xmath7 ( fenimore & ramirez  ruiz 2000 ; reichart et al .",
    "3 .   the peak energy - isotropic energy correlation @xmath0@xmath8 ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; lloyd & ramirez - ruiz 2002 )",
    ". we will call it the amati correlation .",
    "4 .   the peak energy - isotropic peak luminosity correlation @xmath0@xmath9 ( yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) . 5 .",
    "the peak energy - collimation corrected energy correlation @xmath0-@xmath10 ( ghirlanda , ghisellini , lazzati 2004 , ggl04 hereafter )",
    ". we will call it the ghirlanda correlation .",
    "all these correlations can be represented by powerlaws : their slopes are summarized in tab .",
    "1 . note that , for the last three correlations , the peak energy @xmath11 of the @xmath12 spectrum is obtained by fitting the grb spectrum _ time ",
    "integrated over the burst duration .",
    "_    despite several attempts to explain these correlations ( see e.g. eichler d. & lenvison a. 2004 ; liang e. , dai z. & wu x.f .",
    "2004 ) , there is no universally accepted interpretation yet .",
    "one of the major drawback of these correlations is that they were found for a small sample of bursts , mainly due to the limited number of reliable redshift measurements .",
    "however , one test which can be performed even without knowing the redshift is to check if grbs with known fluence and @xmath11 are consistent with  say  the amati correlation , by considering all possible redshifts .",
    "this kind of consistency check has been performed very recently by two groups which tested the amati and the ghirlanda correlation .",
    "nakar & piran ( 2004 , hereafter np04 ) tested the amati correlation in the observed plane @xmath13@xmath14 ( where @xmath14 is the burst observed fluence ) using a sample of bright batse bursts ( from band et al .",
    "1993 ; jimenez , band & piran 2000 ) .",
    "they concluded that @xmath1540% of the batse long ( bright ) bursts are inconsistent with this relation .",
    "band & preece ( 2005 , hereafter bp05 ) extended this work with a larger sample of batse grbs ( 760 bursts from mallozzi et al .",
    "1998 ) and tested both the amati and the ghirlanda correlation .",
    "they claim that at least 88% of their bursts are inconsistent with the amati correlation and 1.6% with the ghirlanda correlation .",
    "they also claim that these conclusions are robust , since they are model  independent .    an important point to notice is what is meant by amati correlation .",
    "originally , amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found @xmath16 with a small scatter , but using only 9 bursts .",
    "later , ggl04 ( see their tab . 1 and tab .",
    "2 ) collected 23 grbs ( including the above 9 ) with redshift measurements and published peak energy , finding a slightly different slope and , more importantly , a larger scatter around the correlation , whose significance was nevertheless improved ( due to the increased number of points ) . in the same paper , it was demonstrated that for all bursts with a good measurement of the jet opening angle ( through the detection of a break in the light curve of the afterglow ) , the scatter of the amati correlation was entirely due to the different opening angles of the jet : bursts with the same collimation  corrected energy @xmath10 and the same intrinsic @xmath0 have different @xmath1 because they have different jet opening angles .",
    "the scatter of the amati correlation , far from being due , i.e. to ill  measured quantities , has a physical origin and is revealing of the distribution of the opening angles of the jets .",
    "bearing this in mind , in this letter we test if @xmath0 correlates with @xmath1 even if we do expect a large scatter around the best fitting line ( if any ) . to this aim",
    "we use a large sample of bursts with  pseudo redshifts \" which have been estimated through the lag  luminosity relation ( sec .",
    "2 ) . having found that indeed the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation exists ( sec .",
    "3 ) , we follow ggl04 and interpret the scatter as due to the distribution of jet opening angles , finding it ( sec .",
    "4 ) . finally",
    "5 ) , we discuss why np04 and bp05 , who also use a large sample of batse bursts , arrive to different conclusions .    during the completion of this work",
    ", we received a manuscript from bosnjak et al . by studying the same problem with an independent and complementary approach ,",
    "they arrive at the same conclusions presented in this letter .    in the following",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath17cdm cosmology with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    .",

    "through a large sample of 442 batse grbs , with known spectral peak energy ( y04 ) and pseudo redshift ( bnb04 ) , we have computed the rest frame peak energy @xmath0 and the k - corrected equivalent isotropic energy @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that these two quantities are correlated : the power - law fit to this correlation gives a slope slightly flatter and an @xmath1 a little smaller than the slope and the @xmath1 found with the 27 grbs with spectroscopic redshifts , respectively .",
    "the scatter of the 442 data points around the fitting line is equal to the scatter of the 27 grbs with known redshift , the existence of outliers being marginal .",
    "we have further interpreted the scatter of these data points as due to the distribution of the jet opening angle of grbs . by requiring that they obey the ghirlanda correlation",
    ", we could estimate this distribution , which is a log - normal with an average angle of about 6.5@xmath22 .",
    "our main conclusion is that the existence of an @xmath0-@xmath23 ( amati ) correlation is confirmed , its scatter is probably rather well known , but its definitive estimate needs a wider sample of grbs with spectroscopic measured redshifts .",
