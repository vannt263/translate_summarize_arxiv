    "phase stability lines ( s=1 ) of different carbon materials have been analysed by bernatowicz et al .",

    "however , these considerations are not taking any details of the nucleation process of titanium carbide itself into account .",
    "the investigation of the properties of molecular clusters is essential for the understanding of dust nucleation in circumstellar environments of agb stars . they can be obtained theoretically by electronic structure techniques to determine the required data of the microphysical processes involved , which are often not at hand ( see also patzer 2007 ) . here",

    "this theoretical level of approximation is a reasonable compromise between computational effort and desired numerical accuracy ( cf .",

    "the small titanium carbide cluster systems investigated so far show structural motives of the bulk tic lattice ( fcc ) .",
    "the calculated positions of the main active ir modes around 15.7  @xmath2 m and @xmath0 21  @xmath2 m of these titanium carbide clusters , which are caused by vibrating carbon atoms in a titanium atom grid , are in very good agreement with the results of the tic cluster measurements of von helden et al .",
    "this does not necessarily imply , that the 21  @xmath2 m feature is caused by tic dust particles .",

    "studying first implications we apply here our findings to the most simple nucleation process , to determine an upper limit on the stationary homogeneous tic nucleation rate ( see e.g. patzer 2004 for more details on nucleation theory ) .",
    "therefore , only the addition of monomers is taken into account and depletion effects are not yet considered .",
    "it turns out , that effective tic nucleation is possible at high temperatures ( see above ) , but high supersaturation ratios are absolutely necessary !",
    "properties of small titanium carbide clusters have been determined from elaborate dft studies . a simple application to the homogeneous process reveals , that in cool and expanding outflows of carbon  rich agb stars effective tic nucleation is in principle possible at high temperatures , but highly supersaturated conditions are required .",
    "first implications according to the condensation sequence are therefore : is tic condensation before c dust formation really possible only at low c / o ratios , especially if high s values are necessary prerequisites ? can such highly supersaturated conditions only occur in inhomogeneous agb winds ?",
    "are other different tic nucleation mechanisms more important , that operate at ( maybe ) lower supersaturation ? to adress these questions ti@xmath3c@xmath4 clusters in further , chemically more complex tic nucleation studies have to be considered ."
