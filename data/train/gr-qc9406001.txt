    "<S> +    models and concepts of quantum optics have been applied to quantum cosmology ( cosmological particle production ) already in the seventies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently grishchuk and sidorov [ gs ] @xcite used the formalism of squeezed states to discuss the spectrum of relic gravitons from inflation , the spectrum of primordial density perturbations , and even the hawking radiation of schwarzschild black holes . </S>",
    "<S> apparently there is no new physics entailed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the squeezing language may well be more effective in characterizing those physical processes which are of basic theoretical interest . </S>",
    "<S> therefore many authors started to use this language in the cosmological context .    here </S>",
    "<S> we apply the shannon - wehrl entropy ( @xmath0 ) @xcite to the squeezing approach of [ gs ] @xcite .    in quantum optics @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is known as an important parameter which is employed to distinguish among various types of coherent states , measuring the relative degree of squeezing with respect to pure coherent states for which @xmath1 is minimum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined as follows @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 representation of the density operator satisfying the normalization condition @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath0 for various types of states is not difficult @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we quote two results of which we shall make use in the following . for the one - mode squeezed states @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the coherent percent component of the squeezed state . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 means the squeezed vacuum state . for the thermal states </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 parameter may be written @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the inverse of the boltzmann modal factor @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us pass now to the squeezing approach of [ gs ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is that gravitons created from zero point fluctuations of an initial vacuum cosmological state are at present in an one - mode squeezed quantum state as the result of the parametric amplification due to the interaction with the variable gravitational background . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing coefficient @xmath12 is a function of the cosmological evolution . </S>",
    "<S> most authors @xcite use an expansion in three stages : inflationary ( i ) , radiation - dominated ( r ) , and matter - dominated ( m ) , with the transitions between stages considered in the ` sudden ' approximation in which the kinematic effects of the transitions are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> thus the universe remains in the same quantum state as before transitions @xcite , and only a redistribution ( squeezing ) of the quasiparticles takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric amplification occurs mainly at the inflationary stage , where the variation of the background is most rapid . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing coefficient can be obtained from the ratios of the dimensionless scale factors at the returning ( either at r - stage or m - stage ) and exit of a given mode out of the hubble sphere at the i - stage , as follows @xmath13 according to [ gs ] @xmath12 increased from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 for waves with present - day frequencies ranging from @xmath16hz , which were amplified at the inflationary stage only . for waves in the range @xmath17hz , the squeezing parameter may reach a value of 120 due to the additional amplification at the matter - dominated transition . </S>",
    "<S> we see that cosmological squeezing is about two orders of magnitude bigger than ordinary laboratory squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicative of the huge mean number of quasiparticles in every mode . making use of the numerical values of the cosmological squeezing coefficient we can plot the @xmath0 entropic parameter for the one - mode squeezed graviton states according to eq.(2 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> a two - mode squeezing comes into play for any type of radiation detected at asymptotic infinity . </S>",
    "<S> however due to the special causal structure of the black hole spacetime , the asymptotic observations are limited to one mode only . under such conditions the detected states turn into thermal ones . actually , hawking radiation is a distorted blackbody radiation , but we can consider it as an effective thermal one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we plotted @xmath0 according to eq.(3 ) , with @xmath18 in the effective boltzmann factor defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the horizon inverse temperature parameter , and @xmath21 is the penetration factor of the curvature and angular momentum barrier around the black hole .    _ </S>",
