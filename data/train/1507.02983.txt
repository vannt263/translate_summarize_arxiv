    "bigrassmannian elements of a coxeter group are elements that have exactly one left descent and exactly one right descent @xcite . in this note , we focus on the symmetric group of order @xmath2 permutations @xmath0 , which is a coxeter group of type @xmath7 . we write a typical element @xmath8 in one - line array notation @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 is the image of @xmath11 under @xmath12 . here",
    "the bigrassmannian ( bg ) permutations are those elements @xmath8 such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 admit a unique descent .",

    "let @xmath23 denote the identity permutation",
    ". in short , ( [ eq - bgform ] ) says that every element of @xmath1 is obtained by selecting a contiguous block of @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) entries from @xmath26 , and interchanging the first @xmath27 and last @xmath28 of these entries , while preserving their respective increasing orders . in the notation of ( [ eq - bgform ] )",
    "we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for example , @xmath31 is obtained from @xmath32 by interchanging the @xmath33 entries starting at the fourth position with the next @xmath34 entries .",
    "recall that the symmetric group @xmath0 equipped with the _ bruhat order _",
    "`` @xmath35 '' becomes a partially - ordered set ( poset ; see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , if @xmath36 then a _ reduction _ of @xmath37 is a permutation obtained from @xmath37 by interchanging some @xmath38 with some @xmath39 provided @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; in other words , the location - pair @xmath42 forms an _ inversion _ of @xmath37 .",
    "we say that @xmath43 in the bruhat order if there is a chain @xmath44 , where each @xmath45 is a reduction of @xmath46 .",
    "the number of inversions in @xmath45 strictly decreases with @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , one can show that if @xmath48 is a reduction of @xmath49 via the interchange @xmath50 , @xmath40 , then    @xmath51    here @xmath52 is the number of inversions in @xmath53 .",
    "the bruhat order notion can be extended to other coxeter groups @xcite , and bigrassmannian elements have been used to investigate the structure of the bruhat order @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall be chiefly interested in restricting our considerations to the bigrassmannian elements @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ bgposet ] illustrates this poset of bg permutations for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "a large portion of this paper is devoted to studying comparable bg permutations ( where comparability is inherited from @xmath3 ) .",
    "note well that a sequence of reductions , when starting from an element @xmath57 , will _ not necessarily _ keep us within the collection of bg permutations .",
    "but checking for bruhat comparability directly by checking all possible sequences of reductions would be an arduous task .",
    "fortunately , there are efficient algorithms for checking bruhat comparability that do not rely upon this reduction operation .",
    "each of these algorithms can be traced back to a comparability criterion due to ehresmann @xcite",
    ". the ehresmann `` tableau criterion '' states that @xmath58 if and only if @xmath59 for all @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the @xmath11th entries in the increasing rearrangement of @xmath63 and of @xmath64 .",
    "these arrangements form two staircase tableaux , hence the term `` tableau criterion . '' for example , comparability of the bg permutations @xmath65 is verified by element - wise comparisons of the two tableaux    @xmath66    these tableaux represent _ monotone triangles _ ( or _ gog triangles _",
    ", in the terminology of zeilberger @xcite ) formed from the two permutations .",
    "monotone triangles are well - known to be in bijection with the collection of alternating sign matrices @xcite , which have been of ubiquitous combinatorial interest in recent years .",
    "the ehresmann tableau criterion requires that @xmath67 conditions be checked .",
    "however , bjrner and brenti @xcite discovered an improved tableau criterion ( based upon deodhar s more general coxeter group characterization in @xcite ) that requires far fewer comparisons .",
    "for the special set of bg permutations , this improved tableau criterion requires only @xmath68 comparisons .",
    "indeed , given @xmath69 , to determine whether @xmath70 we need only check the row of the two tableaux that corresponds to the unique descent of @xmath12 .",
    "so in our example above , @xmath65 is verified more efficiently by element - wise comparisons of the singular row    @xmath71    recently , kobayashi @xcite studied the following question : given a permutation @xmath72 , how many bg permutations are weakly below @xmath73 in the bruhat order ?    given @xmath72 , let @xmath74 denote the number of @xmath21 such that @xmath43 in bruhat order , and let @xmath75 denote the number of @xmath76 such that @xmath77 in bruhat order .    by working in the macneille completion of @xmath0 ( i.e. , the smallest lattice that contains @xmath3 ) , which is known to be isomorphic to the lattice of monotone triangles under entry - wise comparisons ( see , e.g. , stanley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 7.103 ) ) , kobayashi was able to prove the following .",

    "[ thm - bgalpha ] given @xmath80 , in the notation of ( [ eq - bgform ] ) we have @xmath82    we then proceed to study some of the structural properties of the poset @xmath4 .",
    "all of these results hinge on the following equivalent characterization of bruhat - comparability for bg permutations , which we prove in section [ sec - comp ] .",
    "a similar characterization , involving ordered triples , is given in @xcite .",
    "to state the characterization , we first define a vector that encapsulates the same information contained in ( [ eq - bgform ] ) .",

    "when it is unambiguous , we shall suppress the argument @xmath12 and write only @xmath90 for the length vector .",

    "the utility of theorem [ thm - bgcompcrit ] is far - reaching .",
    "specifically , it elicits yet another alternative proof of theorem [ thm - bgbeta ] ( which we give in section [ sec - comp ] ) . theorem [ thm - bgalpha ]",
    "is also rediscovered in the light of the characterization of bg permutations in definition [ def - bgvector ] .",
    "we also indicate how theorem [ thm - bgcompcrit ] reveals that the hasse diagram for @xmath4 has a natural symmetry intrinsic to bg permutations in corollary [ cor - bgcompcrit ] , and how this symmetry does not extend to its embedding in @xmath3 .    in section [ sec - other ] ,",
    "we show how the main idea in the proof of theorem [ thm - bgcompcrit ] delivers a number of other structural results related to @xmath4 . among the many results there ,",
    "we find the degree of a vertex in the hasse diagram of @xmath4 , as well as the total number of edges and the number of maximal ( minimal ) elements in this poset ( in theorems [ thm - degree ] , [ thm - edges ] , and [ thm - number of maximal ] , respectively ) .",
    "we also show that this poset is ranked and provide the corresponding level - function in theorem [ thm - ranked ] , and analyze the number of chains between two comparable elements in theorem [ thm - number of r chains ] .",
    "this latter result delivers an exact formula for the number of maximal chains in @xmath4 ( theorem [ thm - number of max chains ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that this poset possesses the sperner property in theorem [ thm - sperner ] ( i.e. , there exists a rank level that is a maximum antichain ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the results of theorems [ thm - butterfly ] and [ thm - inf ] describe specific properties of the poset of bg permutations that show precisely how far removed this poset is from being a lattice .",
    "henceforth , we shall use both @xmath4 and @xmath1 to refer to the poset of bg permutations .",
    "to begin , we provide an alternate proof of theorem [ thm - bgbeta ] . recall the bjrner - brenti comparability criterion @xcite restricted to bg permutations @xmath12 and @xmath73 : to check if @xmath43 , we only need to check the row of the two tableaux that corresponds to the unique descent of @xmath12 .",
    "this proof of theorem [ thm - bgbeta ] is independent of theorem [ thm - kobayashi ] ; in it we apply the bjrner - brenti comparison criterion .",
    "suppose that @xmath80 with @xmath73 of the form given in ( [ eq - bgform ] ) .",
    "we count the @xmath14 with @xmath43 based on the position of the descent of @xmath12 .",
    "notice that by the bjrner - brenti comparison criterion , the first descent can not happen in position @xmath11 with @xmath101 .",
    "suppose first that the descent happens in position @xmath11 , where @xmath102 ( in other words , it occurs at a place where @xmath73 has a value in the interval from @xmath103 to @xmath84 ) .",
    "there are @xmath104 possible values for the @xmath11th entry of @xmath12 , namely , we have @xmath105 $ ] . since @xmath14 , there can only be one position @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "but each possible @xmath108 and @xmath11 meeting these conditions gives rise to a @xmath14 with @xmath43 , which implies that there are @xmath109 possibilities for @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath11 with @xmath102 , we have @xmath110 possible @xmath14 with @xmath43 . now",
    "if we have @xmath111 ( in other words , where @xmath73 has a value in the interval from @xmath112 to @xmath83 ) , then by the bjrner - brenti comparison criterion the value @xmath10 has @xmath113 possible values ( namely @xmath114 $ ] ) and for a fixed value of @xmath10 , there are @xmath115 possible @xmath14 with @xmath43 ( as @xmath116 for @xmath117 ) .",
    "as before , this produces @xmath118 such @xmath14 .",
    "there are no @xmath14 with @xmath43 and descent at position @xmath119 .",
