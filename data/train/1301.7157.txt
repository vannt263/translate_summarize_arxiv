    "the purpose of this work is to quantify the amount of dark matter associated with group - like objects , focusing on its intra - group ( ig ) matter and the determination of its distribution in a cosmological setting .",

    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : methods ] we describe our simulations and the methods used in this study , such as the algorithm used to determine which halos belong to a group or not . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results regarding the intragroup ( ig ) amount and distribution of dark matter , as well as the evolution in time of the ig dark matter profile for compact associations of galaxies .",

    ", it appears that first and second order perturbation methods at @xmath24 do not make , however , an important difference in halo properties ( knebe et al .",
    "the initial linear power spectrum density is calculated using the transfer function from the cosmic microwave background code camb ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 2000 ) , normalized so that it gives the current mass fluctuation @xmath25 value above .",

    "since we are not interested in small halo substructures , but more on scales of dark halos of typical normal galaxies with virial radius @xmath27kpc , we do not expect important differences in our group finding methods on such parameters as the softening .        several halo finders exist and many of them",

    "our objective is to determine _ physically _ bound group - like objects in our @xmath0cdm cosmological simulations , so we defined clear physical quantities in our search algorithm .",
    "we proceeded as follows to determine a group - like system of `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "first , taking the galaxies of our local group as being typical of a small group environment , we determine a halo mass that can be associated with a galaxy like m33 .",
    "this galaxy is taken as our fiducial lower mass for a `` normal '' galaxy .",
    "for such estimate we used the monotonic mass - luminosity relation of vale & ostriker ( 2004 ) with an absolute magnitude @xmath33 ( mo , van den bosch & white 2010 ) .",
    "we obtained an estimate of @xmath34 , this being for the lowest mass of the dark halo of a normal galaxy to be considered as part of a group of galaxies .",
    "the upper mass was set to about twice that of the milky way , with @xmath35 . in our simulations we identified halos belonging to the a mass range @xmath36 $ ] as the sole participants in determining membership in a small group .",
    "in other words , we excluded small subhaloes from defining a group of galaxies in our approach , as well as very massive galaxies ( e.g. a cd galaxy ) that are not found in small galaxy groups ; we do not consider here fossil groups that may host a cd - type galaxy .",
    "secondly , we used a simple search algorithm to determine our groups of galaxies .",
    "this algorithm required that the number of galaxies @xmath37 to be @xmath38 and within a physical radius of @xmath39mpc from the center of mass of the tentative members , and that no other normal galaxy ( halo ) be within @xmath40 .",
    "the radius @xmath41 chosen corresponds to about the turn - around radius ( gunn & gott  1972 ) of a mass of @xmath42m@xmath23 , and @xmath43 is set only to provide a clear physical isolation criteria from other possible nearby bound structures ; see figure  [ fig : group ] .",
    "we applied iteratively the above algorithm until convergence on the group membership was achieved .",
    "finally , we checked that all groups identified with the above procedure were actually bound systems by estimating their kinetic and potential energy as if galaxies ( haloes ) were point particles .",
    "the kinetic energy of the group was computed from @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the total mass of the group candidate , @xmath46 of a particular component , and @xmath47 the corresponding velocity .",
    "the potential energy was calculated as @xmath48 with @xmath49 the physical separation between two haloes .",
    "we considered the group to be bound if @xmath50 . a similar approach was used by niemi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) to discriminate bound from unbound groups .",
    "it is known that different identification criteria lead to a different number of galaxy associations found in a simulation ( see @xmath32[sec : results ] ) or in the sky .",
    "for example , a hickson s like physical criteria would consider galaxies inside the group radius , @xmath11 , as determined from the sphere that encompasses them not within @xmath41 , and that there are no other similar normal galaxies within three times the group radius .",
    "using as boundary for the group @xmath11 or @xmath41 gives different results as to galaxy membership in a group .",
    "if one would like to use magnitudes in the selection criteria , as when one constructs a mock catalog to compare with observations , a way to assign luminosity more akin to the observational procedure would be required ; either by a monotonic function such as that of vale & ostriker ( 2004 ) or by using a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation .",
    "criteria along the last lines have been used by different authors ( e.g. casagrande & diaferio 2006 , mcconnachie et al .",
    "2008 , daz - gimnez & mamon 2007 , and niemi et al .",
    "2007 ) in order to study small groups using mock catalogues constructed from simulations . however , the latter is out of the scope of the present work that does not intents a comparison with observations .",
    "we also identified groups with criteria that mimics in part hickson s criteria . in this approach",
    "we computed the group radius @xmath11 from the halos identified belonging to a group , and required that no other normal galaxy halo to be located within @xmath51 .",
    "this hickson - like criteria leads to different results when using the @xmath41 radius , and will allow us to quantify probable differences in our results depending on the selection criteria .    in order to differentiate several kinds of compactness found in the groups , we refer to those groups with a spherical radius @xmath52kpc as compact associations ( cas , or compact groups for simplicity ) , intermediate associations ( ias ) to those systems with @xmath53kpc and loose associations ( las , or loose groups ) for groups with @xmath54kpc .",
    "the radius is measured from the center - of - mass to the centres of the haloes belonging to the normal galaxies defining the group .",
    "finally , to quantify the distribution of intra - group dark matter we removed all particles not associated with individual dmhs , and measured its amount and determined its distribution with respect to the group centre - of - mass .",
    "we estimated the mass density profile assuming spherical symmetry for the ig dark matter , and by stacking all of the dark matter found in all the groups in our five cosmological simulations in order to obtain statistically more robust results .",
    "in figure  [ fig : groups ] we show the location of two small groups found in one of our dark matter cosmological simulations . in red we show the particles associated to haloes of galaxies belonging to a group according to our selection criteria , and in blue matter not associated to the dmhs of the group . shown in figure",
    "[ fig : groups ] are only compact ( _ left _ ) and loose ( _ right _ ) association of galaxies .",
    "a visual inspection of our simulations showed that most of our groups are found in filaments of the large - structure ( e.g. hernquist et al .",
    "1995 ) , although some of them are near larger cluster - like structures at the nodes of the cosmic web .",
    "none was found at what might be called voids .",
    "all results are consistent with the general trends of observations of small groups ( e.g. godowski & flin  2010 , mendel et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in our five cosmological simulations we found at @xmath24 a total number of only 6 objects classified as cas , a set of 64 ias , and a total of 661 las .",
    "in particular the number of cas in average per simulation is @xmath55 in our box of volume @xmath56 .",

    "( 2011 ) who found @xmath60 groups in the _ ms _ ; albeit using another search algorithm , the numbers are quite different .",
    "two possible sources of the discrepancy above were investigated . on the one hand ,",
    "the _ ms _ used a higher value of @xmath61 than the value used here , @xmath62 , that may have lead to more structure at the scale of groups . on the other hand",
    ", the selection criteria could have played an important role . in",
    "the following addressed both possible reasons and describe our results next .    to test the influence of the @xmath25 value , we made two additional cosmological simulations with the same cosmological parameters as the _ ms _",
    "( e.g. @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) but in a box of length @xmath66 and with @xmath67 particles .",
    "performing the same analysis as in our simulations above , we found an average of @xmath68 . multiplying the latter numerical values , by the volume correction factor of @xmath58 we obtain a value closer ( @xmath69 ) to the ones of other authors ( e.g. mcconnachie et al .",
    "2008 , daz - gimnez & mamon 2007 ) have obtained when using the _ ms _ , but still far .",
    "these numbers suggest , however , that the higher mass - fluctuation @xmath25 used in the _ ms _ , in comparison to our value @xmath62 , plays a non - insignificant role for explaining the above discrepancy in numbers of cas with other authors .",
    "nonetheless , we can not consider this to be the main reason for the discrepancy in number of groups indicated above .    on the other hand , to explore the selection criteria dependence we applied a search algorithm similar to that of hickson s , with some differences with that of other authors , to both our _ ms_-like simulations and the ones of our ensemble ; i.e. we looked for physical groups isolated within @xmath51 instead of @xmath41 ( see section @xmath70 ) .",
    "ms_-like simulations we found an average of 10 cas and in ours an average of 7 cas .",
    "these numbers are close by themselves and , after correcting by the volume factor indicated above , lead to values similar as those of other authors for these type of groups ( e.g. casagrande & diaferio 2006 , mcconnachie et al . 2008 , daz - gimnez & mamon 2007 , niemi et al .",
    "2007 ) , that use similar selection criteria with luminosity related properties .",
    "other differences of lower order may arise , for instance , due to using a friends - of - friends criteria ( e.g. mcconnachie et al .",
    "2008 ) when fixing the size of the linking length @xmath71 of the `` friendship '' , or with lowering the observational threshold `` magnitude '' of detection in groups in mock catalogs .",
    "the above numerical experiments lead us to conclude that the selection criteria used with @xmath41 as the size of the physical group is the main reason for the discrepancy with the number of cas found by other authors and ourselves .",
    "we will discuss the results of using both our algorithm and the hickson - like criteria , using @xmath11 as the size of the physical group instead of @xmath41 .      as indicated in @xmath32[sec : methods ] we identify dark matter particles associated with an intragroup environment as those not physically bound to the haloes identified with the ahf code ; first all particles within a @xmath72mpc radius and then within @xmath11 . in figure  [",

    "for compact associations we find and average value of @xmath74 , but not shown in figure  [ fig : histo ] as a histogram since we only have a few points .    in general",
    ", the amount of ig dark matter tends to be less than @xmath78% than that of the whole bound system , with a median of @xmath79% irrespective of the configuration of group if the size of the group is taken to be @xmath41 .",
    "this large amount reflects in part the fact that we are considering an @xmath41 spherical radius to quantify the total intragroup dark matter of a group .    when we counted only matter within the group radius @xmath11 for cas we obtained @xmath75 , and for ias and las we find the corresponding fractions to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "as noted the difference between the two ways to determine the size of the group , in regards to the intragroup dark matter fraction , tends to agree only for loose associations and becomes more significantly different for the compact groups .",
    "it is to note that within the group radius @xmath11 , specially for compact configurations , a lot of dark matter particles fin their way into bound structures thus reducing the intragroup medium ; for the latter is defined precisely by particles not bound to any halo of the member galaxies .",
    "this behaviour is noted in the density profiles computed in the next section .",

    "both figures  [ fig : cgroupsdm ] and  [ fig : lgroupsdm ] have no indications of a central concentration of intragroup dark matter and show a behaviour more akin to an homogeneous distribution ; the same behaviour was observed for the intermediate associations . in these plots",
    "we have taken out all the particles belonging to haloes with @xmath83 out of the accounting , but smaller concentrations appear in them .",
    "but for loose groups , but only small fraction of particles are plotted to aid in viewing some residual structures in the dark matter ; i.e. not considered to be bound halos due to our selection criteria . ]    to quantify the degree of concentration of the ig dark matter we computed the density profile of all particles belonging to compact , intermediate and loose associations . in figure",

    "the dynamical state of the whole group is that of a collapsing state , that has not had time to completely be virialized . the same trend was observed for other cas in our simulations .         in order to see if some evolutionary trends in the slopes of the ig dark matter exists , we computed the density profile for all of our cas at three different redshifts : @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath24 .",
    "the results of the mass profile are shown in figure  [ fig : cas - evol ] .",
    "notwithstanding the strong variations of the profile at scales of order @xmath95kpc , there is a tendency for the ig dark matter to be somewhat more cuspy at earlier times .",
    "this is related to the fact that all the matter of the ca at @xmath24 is collapsing at @xmath96 , and the ig dark matter along with it . at @xmath24 some of the particles of ig dark matter at @xmath96 have been bound to halos at @xmath24 .",
    "a deficit of intragroup dark matter at the inner @xmath97kpc tends to be present .",
    "most of the inner dark matter belongs to individual halos of galaxy - like systems .",
    "]    the distribution of intragroup dark matter appears to be more complex than a simple tendency towards being shallower at recent times .",
    "this behaviour is appreciated when the profile at @xmath94 was computed .",
    "all this diversity in the ig medium reflects the complex formation history of compact associations or of a collapsing distribution of matter .",
    "by using a set of @xmath0cdm cosmological simulations , with parameters in agreement with recent results from the wmap7 observations , we have studied the distribution of dark matter in the intragroup environment of small associations of galaxy - like objects .",
    "in general we have found that physically well - defined structures resembling small groups of galaxies have on average @xmath98 per cent of the total mass of the system in an intragroup medium for intermediate or loose groups , and the rest in bound haloes . for compact associations of galaxies",
    "the fraction of intra - group dark matter within the group radius is about 20% of the total group mass .",
    "interestingly enough , these amounts of dark matter are comparable to the amounts ( @xmath99% ) of intracluster light found in observational studies of related astronomical systems . however , their nature appear to be different .",
    "intracluster light comes from tidally stripped stars from galaxies , while our intragroup dark matter tends to be the primordial dark matter out of which the galaxy system was formed .",
    "it will be of interest in the future to measure in simulations that include a baryonic component the amount of intragroup light and compare it with observations .",
    "aside of the rather small amount of ig dark matter for groups , we have found that their distribution is rather flat , with an average logarithmic slope of @xmath1 in the central parts of the associations ; with a deficit of dm at the central @xmath97kpc .",
    "these results indicate that the distribution of dark matter in such group associations does _ not _ follow a cuspy ( e.g. a nfw ) profile , contrary to what happens in individual halos formed in a @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "this results appears to be in concordance with the lensing results of hoekstra et al .",
    "2001 , that use groups of masses similar to the ones considered here .",
    "hence , what might be called a common halo of a small galaxy group bears little resemblance to the haloes of its constituent galaxies .",
    "it is possible that the same situation might be occurring in larger multiplicity systems like galaxy clusters .",
    "the results of this work have also a relevance on works related to the dynamics of small galaxy groups .",
    "for example , our results suggest that dynamical models of the evolution of galaxies in small groups of galaxies with a large amounts of intragroup matter ( e.g. athanassoula et  al .",
    "1997 , villalobos et  al .  2012 ) , or with a cuspy profile for a common halo ( e.g. villalobos et  al .",
    "2012 ) , are not in concordance with the results presented here based on the standard cosmological scenario of @xmath0cdm .",

    ". conclusions of the previous works regarding the dynamical time scale for the merging of groups ( athanassoula et  al .",
    "1997 ) or the effects of the group environment on the evolution of the discs ( villalobos et  al .",
    "2012 ) may be subject to large uncertainties .",
    "on other hand , dynamical models of small groups where no common dark halo exists ( e.g. barnes  1985 , aceves & velzquez  2002 ) would appear to be more consistent with the picture obtained from the cosmological simulations .",
    "researchers of the dynamics of groups and galaxies in such environments ( ias and las ) should consider that about 40% of the total mass of the system is in a common rather homogeneous dark halo , and with about 20% when modeling compact group associations .",
    "effects of the amount and density profile of intragroup dark matter , obtained from a cosmological scenario , on the dynamics of a group of galaxies are planned to be explored in a future work .",
    "this research was funded by unam - papiit and conacyt research projects in109710 and 179662 , respectively .",
    "we warmly thank martn crocce for communications regarding cosmological initial conditions , and to alexander knebe for his help with the the ahf halo finder .",
    "we also thank elena jimnez - bailn for comments and irving lvarez - castillo , from dgctic - unam , for his help with software matters ."
