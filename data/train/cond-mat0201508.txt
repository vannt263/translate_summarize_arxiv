    "coupled limit - cycle oscillators have been extensively used to model the collective behavior of systems in physics @xcite , chemistry and biological sciences @xcite .",
    "the existence of a self organized periodic motion is a direct consequence of the energy exchange between the system and its surroundings keeping the system far from equilibrium .",
    "the mathematical description of those systems relies on differential equations , or its discrete versions , since no hamiltonian exists , and the appearance of a macroscopically synchronized state has been treated as non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "the coupling among oscillatory units is usually considered to be uniform and of infinite range or with first neighbors only . the reason for these choices is simplicity , uniform coupling makes possible analytical calculations , and nearest neighbor coupling is a computationally efficient form of short range coupling . here",
    "we would like to consider a long range distance dependent coupling of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance between oscillators and @xmath2 defines the range : @xmath3 corresponds to uniform coupling , and @xmath4 to nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "for this we consider two different approaches : the kuramoto model for the phases and a cell dynamical system ( cds ) model for phases and amplitudes along the limit cycle .",
    "we observe that , as in equilibrium systems , the critical value for synchronization will depend on the system size and on @xmath5 .",
    "for both models we show that a scaling proposed for equilibrium nonextensive spin systems works well for the synchronization process .",
    "it well known that , depending on the dimensionality @xmath6 of the system , interacting potentials of the type @xmath7 may lead to nonextensive energies .",
    "this problem is usually avoided in the case of uniform or mean field coupling , for which @xmath3 , by the redefinition of the coupling term with the division by the size of the system , @xmath8 .",
    "this correction may be extended to other values of @xmath5 in the nonextensive regime with the definition of a @xmath9 that may be calculated from the requirement that the total energy of the system must be finite .",
    "the equilibrium properties of chains of ferromagnetically coupled spins have been considered in the nonextensive regime for the ising model @xcite and xy model @xcite , the finiteness condition for the energy leads to a common correction factor @xmath10 the extensive behavior is recovered with the definition of the scaled interaction strength @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , ( [ scaling ] ) provides a correction for finite size effects , and for @xmath13 it removes the dependency of the critical coupling strength on @xmath5 and @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath14 , @xmath15 for mean - field coupling ( @xmath3 ) and , @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the behavior of thermodynamical quantities like magnetization and energy as a function of temperature @xmath18 for different values of @xmath8 and @xmath5 are found to collapse with the mean field curve when plotted as a function of @xmath19 , indicating that this regime contains all the information regarding the nonextensive behavior .",
    "one of the simplest models for systems of coupled limit - cycle oscillators is the kuramoto model for the time evolution of the phases . as shown in @xcite , it possible to reduce any system of @xmath8 weakly coupled limit cycle oscillators near the hopf bifurcation , to the set of equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the phase and natural frequency of the @xmath23 oscillator respectively .",
    "the coupling term @xmath24 is a periodic function that may be obtained from the original equations of motion , regardless of the dimensionality of the oscillating field .",
    "the case of uniform , or mean field , coupling has been considered with detail by kuramoto @xcite for the simplest form of the coupling term , @xmath25 kuramoto considered the possibility of a collective oscillatory motion when the natural frequencies are picked from a given distribution @xmath26 , as would happen in a real system .",
    "as the coupling modifies the frequencies , acting as an external oscillatory force , it is necessary to define the asymptotic frequency of the @xmath23 oscillator after the transient regime as @xmath27.\\label{afreq}\\ ] ] the existence of a collective behavior with phase and frequency entrainment depends on the coupling strength and on the choice of @xmath26 @xcite . in what follows",
    "we consider only the case where @xmath26 is gaussian .",
    "kuramoto characterized the degree of synchronization in the asymptotic regime by means of two order parameter like quantities : @xmath28 for the frequencies , and @xmath29 for the phases .",
    "frequency entrainment may be quantified simply by analyzing the formation of frequency clusters and defining @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the size of the largest cluster of oscillators with a common asymptotic frequency @xmath32 .",
    "the complex quantity @xmath33 is appropriate for the phase ordering as it measures the concentration of phases on a certain value .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 behave as equilibrium order parameters in the sense that , for @xmath34 below some critical value @xmath35 , oscillations are incoherent leading to @xmath28 and @xmath29=0 . for strong enough coupling , or @xmath36 ,",
    "collective oscillation takes place and @xmath37 .    for the case of uniform coupling , phase and frequency",
    "entrainment appear simultaneously at the critical value @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average value of the distribution of natural frequencies @xcite .",
    "the long range version of the coupling term is written as @xmath40 and was considered in the case of oscillator chains in @xcite . in hamiltonian systems",
    "the limit of non - extensivity can be found by requiring the upper value of the energy to be finite as @xmath41 .",
    "limit cycle oscillators are open systems and energy is a meaningless quantity so , instead , we establish the finiteness condition for @xmath42 in the asymptotic regime",
    ". this condition may be established by requiring that the upper value of the coupling term divided by @xmath8 must be finite , as in the mean field coupling case . with this",
    ", we end up with a condition identical to ( [ scaling ] ) , but , as will be clear from the graphs below , the factor @xmath43 does not seem to be present in this case . for any value of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , it is then possible to incorporate the dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath8 of the coupling term into the value of @xmath34 with the definition of a scaled coupling strength @xmath44    in order to numerically study the non - extensive region , we used two dimensional square lattices of coupled oscillators with natural frequencies sorted from the gaussian distribution @xmath45 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "equation ( [ kmodel ] ) with the coupling ( [ necoupling ] ) was then integrated using the euler method with d@xmath46 .",
    "the first 3000 iterations where discarded as a transient , and after 6000 iterations past the transient , we calculated the asymptotic frequencies as defined in ( [ afreq ] ) .",
    "we used the hoshen - kopelman method @xcite to analyze the frequency pattern , two sites were considered to belong to same cluster if the frequency difference between them was less than @xmath47 , where @xmath18 is the time elapsed after the transient .",
    "@xmath28 was then associated to the largest cluster , and averaged over 10 initial conditions for the natural frequencies .",
    "the non - extensivity is evident if we consider the behavior of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath34 for @xmath13 . for fixed @xmath5 ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath35 decreases with increasing @xmath8 as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ alfa075].a ) , as more terms contribute to the coupling .",
    "the shift in @xmath35 may be corrected with the use of ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we plot @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 , there is no dependence on the system size , the curves collapse and a unique value of @xmath50 appears .",
    "figure ( [ alfa075].b ) shows the behavior of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 for fixed @xmath5 .",
    "= 14.4 cm = 8.4 cm    = 14.4 cm = 8.4 cm    the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath5 is evident if we plot @xmath48 for fixed @xmath8 and different values of @xmath5 .",
    "figure ( [ n1024].a ) shows the curves for @xmath51 , 0.50 , 0.75 , and 0 ( mean - field coupling without the correction factor @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that we did not use the factor @xmath53 as predicted for the spin systems .",
    "consistently with dependence on system size , as @xmath5 decreases , more terms are included in the coupling , leading to smaller values of @xmath35 .",
    "again , ( [ scaling ] ) fixes the dependence on @xmath5 providing a perfect collapse even with the mean - field curve as can be seen in figure ( [ n1024].b ) .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath54 in figures ( [ alfa075 ] ) and ( [ n1024 ] ) is in good agreement with ( [ kc ] ) , our frequency distribution leads to @xmath55 .",
    "a more complete description of the system includes information about the amplitudes by means of the definition of an oscillatory field @xmath56.\\ ] ] this is an important aspect since oscillator death is possible as we effectively increase the coupling strength with the variation of system size and coupling range @xcite .",
    "the spirit of cell dynamical modeling is the discretization of time and space from the start , as opposed to formulating a continuous model and then further adopting some discretization scheme . in this sense",
    ", @xmath57 defines the position of the @xmath58-th cell at time @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are then the amplitude and the phase of the field at given cell .",
    "the time evolution of the system is then given by the repeated application of the map @xmath62+\\sum_{j\\neq i}d_{ij}\\{f[z(j , t)]-f[z(i , t)]\\ } \\label{cds}\\ ] ] where the local dynamics is regulated by @xmath63=a\\exp(i \\omega)\\frac{z(t)}{\\sqrt{1+|z(t)|^2(a^2 - 1)}}$ ] .",
    "this form of @xmath64 corresponds to an asymptotically stable limit cycle of unit radius for all @xmath65 @xcite . here",
    "the parameter @xmath66 is a measure of the attraction to the limit cycle .",
    "the long range coupling is implemented through the definition of @xmath67 .    for observation of synchronization , we considered chains of @xmath68 oscillators with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath69 , gaussian distribution of natural frequencies with unit mean value and variance 0.1 .",
    "we iterated ( [ cds ] ) 4000 times , the first 1000 being discarded as a transient , and the order parameter @xmath29",
    "was then calculated .",
    "this procedure was repeated for different chain sizes and values of the decay exponent @xmath5 for several values of the coupling strength @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ chain100](a ) shows the synchronization curves averaged over 20 samples .",
    "as expected , the critical value of @xmath70 is dependent on @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "although the calculation of the upper bound of the coupling term is rather different from the one in the kuramoto model or spin systems , the same form of scaling is observed here .",
    "figure [ chain100](b ) shows the synchronization curves of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "= 14.4 cm = 10 cm    it is important to verify the effect of nonextensivity on the stability of the oscillatory state .",
    "it is well known that , depending on the amplitudes and frequency spread , an increase in coupling strength may lead to stabilization of the rest state .",
    "this has been observed for systems with mean field coupling @xcite and for pairs of oscillators @xcite . in order to observe this effect",
    "we increased the frequency spread to 0.7 , then , for a fixed value of @xmath8 and @xmath5 , we varied @xmath70 and @xmath66 .",
    "after the 4000 iterations we verified whether the amplitude was non zero .",
    "the same procedure was repeated for @xmath72 , 0.5 and 0.9 .",
    "figure [ death](a ) shows the @xmath73 phase diagram indicating regions of synchronization , incoherent motion and death for the different values of @xmath5 .",

    "= 13.cm = 9.5 cm",
    "the above results bring the process of synchronization even closer to an order disorder transition , as we directly use the scaling proposed for nonextensive equilibrium systems .",
    "also , we see that the important quantity for synchronization and stability of the oscillatory phase is the scaled coupling constant . with this in mind , one can easily tune the interaction strength to obtain the desired regime , in the case of distant dependent coupling .",
    "some points still remain unclear .",
    "first , there is no a priori reason for the scaling of the cds model to be the same as that of hamiltonian spin systems .",
    "second we can not justify the absence of the factor @xmath43 in the scaling of the kuramoto model , which has a condition for extensivity identical to hamiltonian spin systems .",
    "actually we found by tentative and error that for the kuramoto oscillators a better form of scaling should have a factor @xmath74 .",
    "since the results for spin hamiltonians and for the cds model are for one dimensional systems , this correction would not affect their scaling , although we are not able to analytically justify this form .",
