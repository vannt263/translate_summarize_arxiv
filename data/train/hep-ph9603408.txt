    "0    the studies of the transition form factor for the process @xmath12 when two virtual photons @xmath13 produce a neutral pion is apparently the cleanest case for testing qcd predictions for elastic processes .",
    "in contrast to the pion electromagnetic form factor , the perturbative qcd subprocess @xmath14 appears at the zeroth order in the qcd coupling constant @xmath15 , and the asymptotically leading term has no suppression .",
    "the relevant diagram resembles the handbag diagram for the forward virtual compton amplitude used in the studies of deep inelastic scattering .",
    "this gives good reasons to expect that perturbative qcd for this process may work at accessible values of spacelike photon virtualities @xmath16 . in the lowest order , pqcd predicts that @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath7 is the pion distribution amplitude and @xmath18 are the fractions of the pion light - cone momentum carried by the quarks . in the region where both photon virtualities are large : @xmath19[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}\\ , 1 \\ ,",
    "gev^2 $ ] , the pqcd predicts the overall @xmath9 fall - off of the form factor , which differs from the naive vector meson dominance expectation @xmath20 .",
    "thus , establishing the @xmath9 power law in this region is a crucial test of pqcd for this process .",
    "the study of @xmath21 over a wide range of the ratio @xmath22 of two large photon virtualities can then provide a nontrivial information about the shape of @xmath7 .",
    "however , experimentally most favourable situation is when one of the photons is real @xmath23 or almost real . for experiments on @xmath24-machines having one small virtuality",
    "strongly increases the cross section .",
    "it was also proposed to use real photons to study the @xmath25 production in @xmath26 collisions @xcite . on fixed - target accelerators , like cebaf",
    ", one can attempt to study the @xmath27 form factor through @xmath28 processes @xcite with a photon in the final state . in the @xmath29 limit ( with @xmath6 large )",
    ", the nonperturbative information about the pion is accumulated in the same integral @xmath30 of @xmath31 that appears in the asymptotic pqcd expression for the one - gluon exchange contribution for the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "hence , information extracted from the studies of @xmath27 can be used to settle the bounds on the pqcd hard contribution to the pion em form factor .    since the zeroth moment of the pion distribution function is normalized by the matrix element of the axial current ( @xmath32 by the pion decay constant @xmath33 ) , the value of @xmath30 is sensitive to the shape of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "two most popular choices are the asymptotic form @xmath34 @xcite-@xcite and the cz model @xmath35 @xcite . using @xmath36 increases the integral by an extra factor of 5/3 compared to the value based on @xmath37 .",
    "this observation can be used for an experimental discrimination between these two models .",
    "in fact , both the cello data @xcite and preliminary high-@xmath6 cleo data @xcite seem to favour the leading - order pqcd prediction with the normalization corresponding to a rather narrow distribution amplitude close to @xmath37 . to perform a detailed comparison of the ( future ) data with theoretical predictions ,",
    "one should take into account the pqcd radiative corrections .",
    "these include the one - loop contributions to the hard scattering amplitude @xcite , which , decreasing the leading - order result by about @xmath38 , still leave a sizable gap between the predictions based on two models mentioned above .",
    "one should also add the terms generated by two - loop evolution of the pion distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "originally , these corrections were found to be tiny @xcite .",
    "a recent progress @xcite in understanding the structure of the two - loop evolution suggests that the size of these corrections is somewhat larger .",
    "however , the numerical analysis of the two - loop evolution presented in ref.@xcite does not indicate appreciable changes for the integral over the distribution amplitude .",
    "hence , there are good chances that the controversial subject of the shape of @xmath7 may soon be settled experimentally .    within the pqcd approach",
    ", the pion distribution amplitude @xmath7 is a phenomenological model function whose shape should be taken either from experiment ( this was not possible so far ) or calculated in some nonperturbative approach , @xmath39 using qcd sum rules .",
    "however , applications of the qcd sum rules to nonlocal hadronic characteristics ( functions ) , like distribution amplitudes @xmath40 are much more involved than those for the simpler classic cases @xcite of hadronic masses and decay widths .",
    "the trickiest problem is that the underlying operator product expansion ( ope ) for the relevant correlators has a slow convergence because some terms are parametrically enhanced by powers of @xmath41 for the @xmath42 moment of the distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "for this reason , one needs a very detailed information about the nonperturbative qcd vacuum to get a reliable sum rule .",
    "such information is not available yet , and results for @xmath7 have a strong model dependence@xcite . in the present paper , instead of starting with the pqcd approach and taking @xmath7 from qcd sum rules , we calculate @xmath27 directly from a qcd sum rule for the three - point function .",
    "a serious problem for such an attempt is that one of the photons has a small virtuality and the relevant three - point amplitude is sensitive to nonperturbative long - distance qcd dynamics .",
    "for this reason , as an intermediate step , we construct a qcd sum rule for a simpler kinematical situation when both photon virtualities are large .",
    "to take the @xmath29 limit , we perform additional factorization using the methods developed in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our basic object : the correlator of two vector and one axial current , discuss its behaviour in different kinematical situations and interrelation between qcd sum rules and pqcd approaches .",
    "the situation when both photon virtualities are large is considered in section 3 .",
    "we construct there the qcd sum rule valid in this `` large-@xmath43 '' kinematics and analyze its structure and some limiting cases . in section 4 , we outline specific problems one faces trying to use the operator product expansion in the limit when one of the photon virtualities is small ( small-@xmath43 kinematics ) .",
    "the basic features of mass singularities , which appear in this limit , are illustrated using a scalar model as a toy example .",
    "the methods developed there are then used in section 5 to construct a factorization procedure of long- and short - distance contributions in the realistic qcd situation .",
    "we show that the long - distance contributions in this case have the structure of bilocal correlators which are considered in section 6 .",
    "in particular , we discuss there the continuum and @xmath44-meson contributions into the bilocal correlators . in section 7",
    ", we study the contact terms @xcite which appear in some bilocals . in section 8 ,",
    "we collect together the contributions calculated in preceding sections and write down the qcd sum rule for the @xmath21 form factor valid in small-@xmath43 kinematics .",
    "we analyze the @xmath29 limit and present our results for @xmath27 . in the concluding section",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "some technical details of our calculations can be found in the appendix .",
    "0      the form factor @xmath45 of the @xmath46 transition is determined by the matrix element @xmath47 where @xmath48  is the electromagnetic current of the light quarks ( divided by the electron charge ) : @xmath49 @xmath50 is a one - pion state with the 4-momentum @xmath51 and we use throughout the convention @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54    to study the form factor , we should construct first a formalism in which the pion would emerge as a qcd bound state in the @xmath55 system .",

    ", @xmath77 has the pole @xmath78 , and the form factor @xmath79 can be extracted from the residue of that pole .    however , the problem is that the bound state poles are present only in full amplitudes , formally corresponding to the total sums over all orders of perturbation theory ( in qcd one should not forget to add also nonperturbative contributions ) .",
    "terms corresponding to any finite order do not have such poles .",
    "fortunately , it is not always necessary to perform an explicit all - order summation ( impossible in qcd ) to extract information about a particular bound state .      using the axial anomaly @xcite relation for massless quarks @xmath80 we obtain the constraint @xmath81 for real photons ( @xmath82 ) , this reduces to @xmath83 , provided that @xmath84 and @xmath85 do not have @xmath86 or @xmath87 singularities , which is true since there are no massless @xmath55 bound states in the vector channel .",
    "hence , @xmath88 for real photons , @xmath32 @xmath89 really has a pole corresponding to a massless pion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the anomaly relation ( [ eq : axconstr ] ) fixes the value of the @xmath63 form factor when both virtualities of the photons are zero : @xmath90 it should be emphasized that the anomaly relation does not require that @xmath91 has this value for all @xmath6 : eq.([eq : axconstr ] ) can be satisfied even if @xmath92 has a nontrivial dependence on photon virtualities .",
    "thus , the axial anomaly allows one to calculate exactly one particular combination of invariant amplitudes ( [ eq : axconstr ] ) for arbitrary values of the virtualities @xmath93 . in qcd , this is a rather exceptional situation .",
    "normally , a reliable qcd calculation is possible only in the region of large virtualities where one can incorporate the asymptotic freedom property of the theory .",

    "this means that this contribution is not factorizable in the usual sense and should be considered within the qcd sum rule context ( see discussion below ) .",

    ", the asymptotic @xmath9-dependence can not be a true behaviour of @xmath131 for all @xmath6-values : it should be somehow modified in the low-@xmath6 region to comply with the bound on @xmath131 in the @xmath8 limit imposed by the anomaly relation ( [ eq : norma ] ) .",
    "brodsky and lepage @xcite proposed the interpolation formula @xmath134 which reproduces both the @xmath135 value ( [ eq : norma ] ) and the high-@xmath6 asymptotics ( [ eq : fggpias ] ) dictated by the asymptotic form of the distribution amplitude ( [ eq : phias ] ) . according to refs.@xcite , this formula agrees with experimental data",

    "the model distribution amplitude constructed in @xcite gives @xmath148 .",
    "one can also try to construct a qcd sum rule directly for the integral @xmath30 .",
    "however , it is clear that such a sum rule can not be derived by a simple substitution of the original cz sum rule into the integral ( [ eq : i ] ) , because of singularities generated by the @xmath149 and @xmath150 terms .",
    "the singularities disappear if one uses the nonlocal condensates in the sum rule for @xmath137 , and the resulting value for @xmath30 is close to 3 @xcite .",
    "a more radical way is to consider the sum rule for the original @xmath111 amplitude as a whole , without approximating it by the first term of the pqcd expansion .",
    "as we will see , the singularities mentioned above will appear then as the power @xmath151 infrared singularities in the relevant operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "however , these singularities are caused by a formal extension of the ope formulas from the large @xmath43 region where they are valid , into the small-@xmath43 region , where the ope breaks down .",
    "in fact , the ope should be modified in the small-@xmath43 region .",
    "such a modification is equivalent to the regularization of the infrared singularities .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to construct a qcd sum rule for the transition form factor valid in the region of small @xmath43 .      if the photon virtualities are not very large , then it is normally impossible to factorize the @xmath152-dependence of the diagrams contributing to the three - point amplitude @xmath153 into separate factors one of which will produce the pion pole . we know",

    ", it is convenient to use the dispersion relation for the three - point amplitude : @xmath154    the pion contribution to the spectral density is proportional to the @xmath155  form factor : @xmath156 but any approximation for @xmath153 obtained from a pt expansion , gives information not only about the pion , but also about the higher states .",
    "hence , there are two problems .",
    "first , we should arrange a reliable pt expansion for @xmath153 .",
    "the only way is to take @xmath152 spacelike and large enough to produce a reasonably converging ope .",
    "the second problem is that when @xmath152 is large , the pion contribution does not overwhelmingly dominate the dispersion integral and , to disentangle it , one should subtract the contribution due to higher states .",
    "note , that though the contribution of a state located at @xmath157 is suppressed by the @xmath158-factor compared to that of a state at @xmath159 , the relative suppression of higher states disappears as @xmath160 tends to infinity .",
    "the higher states include @xmath161 and higher pseudovector resonances which presumably become broader and broader , with their sum rapidly approaching the pqcd spectral density .",
    "so , the simplest model is to approximate all the higher states , including the @xmath161 , by the spectral density @xmath162 calculated in perturbation theory : @xmath163 where the parameter @xmath164 is the effective threshold for the higher states .",
    "the smaller @xmath152 , the bigger relative contribution of the lowest state .",

    "when all @xmath651 s are non - negative , there are two basic possibilities to arrange @xmath652 . in the first case , called the `` short - distance regime '' , @xmath651 vanishes faster than @xmath653 when some of the @xmath297-parameters tend to zero ( small @xmath297 correspond to large virtualities @xmath654 , @xmath32 to short distances ) .",
