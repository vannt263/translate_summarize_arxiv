    "in the last few decades several aspects of cuprate superconductors ( scs ) have been studied and many efforts have been spent to understand the unique and complex phase diagram exhibited by this class of materials ; see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "superconductivity in cuprates appears to be due to a mechanism analogous to the bcs one in ordinary superconductors . however , superconductivity is only one of the characteristic features of these materials .",
    "there are many other new properties that require more complex mechanisms and can be understood only if the interplay between bcs and additional order parameters is considered .",
    "for instance , at @xmath3 , @xmath4 at very low doping @xmath5 is an insulator with long - range magnetic order .",
    "increasing @xmath5 , at @xmath6 an insulator - superconductor first - order transition takes place , giving rise to a superconducting state in which spins are still magnetically ordered @xcite . at @xmath7",
    "another phase transition occurs , and , for @xmath8 , the material shows no magnetic order ",
    "it is paramagnetic  but is still superconducting .",
    "neutron - scattering experiments@xcite suggested that this transition is continuous .",
    "moreover , in the ordered phase @xmath9 , they revealed the presence of collinearly polarized spin - density waves ( sdws ) with wavevectors @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a function of the doping concentration and @xmath12 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath13 are two - dimensional since cuprates are supposed to be made of weakly interacting planes and thus behave approximately as two - dimensional systems .",
    "following ref .  , we assume that superconductivity is not relevant at the transition which is instead driven by the interaction among the sdw degrees of freedom",
    ". since @xmath3 one should take into account the quantum nature of the system .",
    "quantum phase transitions can be studied by introducing a supplementary dimension parametrized by an imaginary time variable @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant order parameter is the spin field which is parametrized as @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are complex amplitudes .",
    "there are two interesting limiting cases .",
    "the first one is when the order parameter can be written as @xmath17 which corresponds to collinearly polarized sdws .",
    "the second one is when @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which corresponds to circularly polarized sdws . in cuprates experiments",
    "indicate that the ground state shows a collinear behavior.@xcite    the standard strategy for writing down an effective hamiltonian for a given physical system consists in considering all polynomials of the order parameter of order less than or equal to four that are compatible with the expected symmetries . in the sdw - sc",
    " to  sc phase transition the order parameter is the complex field @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding symmetries are the following : ( i ) so(3 ) spin rotations : @xmath24 ; ( ii ) translational symmetry of the spin waves : @xmath25 ; ( iii ) spatial inversion : @xmath26 ;",
    "( iv ) interchange of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 axes : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the most general hamiltonian with these symmetries is@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are parameters called sdw velocities .",
    "terms such as @xmath34 are forbidden by spatial inversion symmetry and terms like @xmath35 , even if permitted by all symmetries , can be eliminated by redefining the fields as @xmath36 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ lgwhor ] ) admits several different ground states depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "they are classified in app .",
    "in particular , there is the possibility that both fields correspond to collinearly polarized sdws as observed in experiments : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfy either @xmath41 or @xmath42 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of the fixed points ( fps ) of the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow of the effective hamiltonian ( [ lgwhor ] ) .",
    "if a stable fp exists and its attraction domain includes systems with collinearly polarized sdws , then the sdw - sc  to  sc transition may be continuous .",
    "otherwise , it must be of first order . in our study",
    ", we consider only the case @xmath43 that simplifies the analysis and allows us to perform a high - order perturbative analysis .",

    "the physically relevant case is @xmath47 .",
    "we first perform a standard analysis close to four dimensions,@xcite computing the rg functions in powers of @xmath48 .",
    "a one - loop analysis indicates that a stable fp exists only for @xmath49 .",
    "apparently , this result casts doubts on the existence of a stable fp in three dimensions .",
    "however , in three dimensions there may exist fps that are absent for @xmath50 .",
    "this is indeed what happens in the ginzburg - landau model of superconductors , in which a complex scalar field couples to a gauge field@xcite and in o(2)@xmath51o(@xmath52 ) symmetric models.@xcite thus , a more careful investigation of the rg flow in three dimensions calls for strictly three - dimensional perturbative schemes . for this purpose",
    "we consider two field - theoretical perturbative approaches : the minimal - subtraction scheme without @xmath53 expansion@xcite ( in the following we will indicate it as @xmath54-@xmath55 scheme ) and the massive zero - momentum ( mzm ) renormalization scheme.@xcite the use of two different schemes is crucial , since the comparison of the corresponding results provides a nontrivial check on the reliability of our conclusions . in the @xmath54-@xmath55 scheme",
    "one considers the massless ( critical ) theory in dimensional regularization,@xcite determines the rg functions from the divergences appearing in the perturbative expansion of the correlation functions , and finally sets @xmath56 without expanding in powers of @xmath53 ( this scheme therefore differs from the standard @xmath53 expansion@xcite ) . in the mzm scheme",
    "one considers instead the three - dimensional massive theory in the disordered ( high - temperature ) phase .",
    "we compute the @xmath57 functions to five loops in the @xmath54-@xmath55 scheme and to six loops in the mzm scheme .",
    "we use a symbolic manipulation program that generates the diagrams ( approximately one thousand at six loops ) and computes their symmetry and group factors , and the compilation of feynman integrals of refs .  .",
    "the series are available on request .",
    "the perturbative expansions are then resummed using the known large - order behavior .",
    "the perturbative analysis of the rg flow in the full theory is not sufficiently stable to provide reliable results .",

    "a detailed mean - field analysis shows that in some parameter region hamiltonian ( [ lgwhor ] ) has a continuous transition separating a spin disordered phase from an ordered phase characterized by two collinearly polarized sdws .",
    "there are two different possibilities for the the axes of these sdws : either @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "we have then investigated the role of fluctuations in a simplified model in which the two sdws have the same velocity . for this purpose",
    "we have generated six - loop perturbative series in the mzm scheme and five - loop series in dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction .",
    "close to four dimensions , an analytic @xmath53-expansion calculation shows no presence of stable fps .",

    "we have analyzed the stability of some fps that belong to known submodels .",
    "the analysis of the perturbative series supports the stability of the @xmath250 collinear fp .",
    "the analyses of the mzm and @xmath54-@xmath55 expansions do not provide sufficiently stable results for the rg flow in the full theory , i.e. in the general space of its five quartic couplings .",
    "in particular , they do not allow us to draw any definite conclusion on the existence of other stable fps . in any case , even without the analysis of the full flow , simple considerations ( reported in app .",
    "[ appa ] ) show that systems with collinear sdws with the same axis ( the mean - field solution ( 3 ) reported in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) are in the attraction domain of the @xmath250 collinear fp .",

    "indeed , one expects the sdw velocities @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be close in magnitude , of the order of the spin - wave velocity of the nel state of the undoped insulator.@xcite therefore , the rg flow always starts very close to the stable fp of the theory with @xmath43 , and thus the critical behavior is controlled by this fp except in a narrow interval around the critical doping .",
    "experiments indicate that the sdw - sc  to  sc transition is continuous and is associated with collinear sdws .",
    "it is thus natural to conjecture that its critical behavior is controlled by the @xmath0 collinear fp , since this fp is stable in model ( [ lgwh ] ) and its basin of attraction includes systems with collinear sdws .",

    "( [ hstat ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the ground states also allows us to determine the stability domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , a point in the coupling space does not belong to the stability domain if there is a field such that @xmath268 .",
    "being @xmath260 homogeneous , it is not restrictive to consider only fields such that @xmath269 . thus , the determination of the minima of @xmath260 is equivalent to the determination of the minima of @xmath270 where @xmath271 is now interpreted as a lagrange multiplier .",
    "( [ hstat ] ) shows that @xmath260 can be negative only for @xmath62 .",

    "for this reason , these solutions have not been included above .",
    "the computation of all stationary points is quite straightforward , except for solution 7 .",
    "we shall now briefly sketch how it is derived .",
    "assume that @xmath324 and @xmath325 and define @xmath326 , etc .",
