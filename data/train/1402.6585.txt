    "we know for the ozi ( okubo - zweig - iizuka ) suppressed decays of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 to hadrons proceed via the annihilation of the quark - antiquark pair into three gluons or a photon , pqcd provides a relation for the ratios of branching fractions ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath9 and @xmath7 decays @xmath10 which is referred to as the `` 12% rule '' and is expected to apply with reasonable accuracy to both inclusive and exclusive decays .",
    "however , it is found to be severely violated for @xmath11 and other vp and vt final states .",
    "a similar rule can be derived for ozi - suppressed bottomonium decays : @xmath12 recently , using 102 million @xmath0 and 158 million @xmath1 events belle studied exclusive hadronic decays of these two bottomonium resonances to the three - body final states @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite , and to the two - body vt states ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and ap ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) states  @xcite .",
    "signals are observed for the first time in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath25 decay modes .",
    "besides @xmath26 , no other two - body processes are observed in all investigated final states . for the processes @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , the @xmath30 ratios are consistent with the expected value , while for @xmath14 , the measured @xmath30 ratio is @xmath31 below the pqcd expectation .",
    "the results for the other modes are inconclusive due to low statistical significance .",
    "we also used the same data samples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to study exclusive hadronic decays to the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , and two - body vp ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath11 ) final states  @xcite . after event selections , fig .",
    "[ vt - fit ] shows the @xmath38 and @xmath39 invariant mass distributions for the @xmath40 final state , the @xmath34 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath41 final state , and the @xmath42 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath43 final state .",

    "signals are observed for the first time in the @xmath44 , @xmath33 and @xmath45 decay modes .",
    "there is an indication for large isospin - violation between the branching fractions for the charged and neutral @xmath46 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , as in @xmath47 decays , which indicates that the electromagnetic process plays an important role in these decays . for the processes @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the @xmath30 ratios are consistent with the expected value ; for @xmath34 , the @xmath30 ratio is a little lower than the pqcd prediction .",
    "the results for the other modes are inconclusive due to low statistical significance .",
    "different models predict different energy dependence of the cross sections for the process @xmath51 vp .",
    "if su(3 ) flavor symmetry is perfect , one expects the cross sections of @xmath52 production equal 9:8:2 .",
    "however , this relation was found to be violated severely at @xmath53 gev and 3.773  gev by the cleo experiment with the ratio @xmath54 greater than 9 and 33 at @xmath53 gev and 3.773  gev , respectively , at the 90% c.l . by taking into account su(3)@xmath55 symmetry breaking ,",
    "a pqcd calculation predicts @xmath56 . in the quark model",
    ", one may naively expect @xmath57 .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are measured  @xcite , based on data samples of 89  fb@xmath2 , 703  fb@xmath2 , and 121  fb@xmath2 collected at @xmath6110.52 , 10.58 ( @xmath62 peak ) , and 10.876  gev ( @xmath63 peak ) , respectively . after event selections , fig .",

    "assuming @xmath64 dependence , the fit gives @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 cross sections distributions . with the calculated born cross sections , we obtain @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 , 10.58 , and 10.876  gev , respectively , at the 90% c.l .",
