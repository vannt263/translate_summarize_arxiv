    "inflation @xcite is now widely considered to be the most attractive scenario for describing the early evolution of the universe .",
    "one of the reasons why inflation succeeds as a standard paradigm is that it not only solves conundrums in the big bang theory ( horizon / flatness / monopole problems ) but also predicts an almost scale - invariant spectrum of scalar ( density ) perturbations originating from quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction is consistent with large - scale structure and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations , and there have been intensive attempts to obtain a deeper understanding of inflation dynamics through analysis of these observations .",
    "moreover , inflation also generates an almost scale - invariant spectrum of tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves ) @xcite , the detection of which is expected to provide a new source of information on the early universe , and provide a key to discriminate between inflation and alternative models .",
    "there are ongoing efforts to detect indirectly this inflation - produced gravitational wave background , such as the next - generation cmb experiments which measure cmb polarization patterns induced by gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "clearly , the direct detection @xcite of the primordial gravitational wave background would provide an even more attractive prospect .",
    "the most striking property of gravitational waves is their weakness of interaction with matter .",
    "while this property makes direct detection very difficult , it may provide the following specific benefits .",
    "since primordial gravitational waves propagate freely since the end of inflation because of their weak interactions with matter , one may observe a remnant of inflation directly through observation .",
    "in addition , due to the smallness of their amplitude , a linear approximation is valid for gravitational waves in all scales .",
    "this makes it easy to study their behavior at any frequency .",
    "this is in contrast to density perturbations , whose evolution is more complicated , and which have now grown nonlinear at small scales . [",
    "although gravitational waves are affected by the second order term of the primordial density perturbations @xcite and the growing nonlinear modes @xcite through the anisotropic stress term , these effects appear at very low frequencies ( @xmath1hz ) and have been estimated to be small . ]",
    "therefore , the gravitational wave background has the potential to allow us to extract `` clean '' information from the early universe , and is extremely attractive as a tool of future observational cosmology .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to provide precise predictions for the spectrum amplitude of the gravitational wave background as preparation for assessing detectability in future experiments aiming at the direct detection of gravitational waves .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the tilt and the amplitude of the spectrum strongly depend on the inflation model .",
    "also , after inflation , changes in the hubble expansion rate and the anisotropic stress of neutrinos induce characteristic features in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "these components which affect the spectrum should be considered all together to estimate accurately the amplitude of the spectrum over a wide frequency range .",
    "the latter effects have been well investigated at frequencies below @xmath2hz by watanabe and komatsu @xcite , who calculate the spectrum taking into account both the change of the effective number of degrees of freedom and the neutrino anisotropic stress .",
    "in contrast , our interest lies particularly in the higher - frequency region of the gravitational wave background spectrum .",
    "the reason why we focus on the high frequency modes is that they are sensitive to a crucial aspect of the dynamics of inflation : how inflation terminates .",
    "the high frequency modes are produced outside the horizon near the end of inflation and reenter the horizon soonest after inflation ends , in the period where reheating is considered to occur .",
    "since the amplitude of a gravitational - wave mode is affected by the hubble expansion rate at the point when that mode crosses the horizon , the spectrum of these modes depends on the particular inflation and reheating models chosen .",
    "this means that it may be possible to extract information about the epoch , which is still quite unclear , through direct detection of the gravitational wave background .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically analyze the spectrum of the primordial gravitational wave background for several inflation models .",
    "it is particularly worth noting that the dynamics of inflation and reheating are included by numerically solving the relevant equations , which describe an inflaton field rolling down its potential and subsequently decaying into radiation with oscillation at the bottom of the potential .",
    "this means that we make no use of the slow - roll approximation , which is no longer valid near the end of inflation , unlike many previous works @xcite .",
    "our numerical approach for computing the dynamics of inflation enables us to find the deviation from this approximation , which depends strongly on the inflation model .",
    "moreover this numerical approach works effectively to connect the change of the hubble expansion rate smoothly from the inflation phase to the radiation - dominated era via the reheating process , which can not be accurately treated analytically .",
    "since the hubble expansion rate depends on the behavior of the scalar field and following reheating process , the amplitude of the high frequency modes are determined by a combination of both the dynamics of inflation and the reheating mechanism .",
    "detailed numerical calculations of these processes are therefore required in order to examine precisely the high frequency gravitational waves which are the main subject of this paper .    in our calculation ,",
    "we take into account the change of the effective number of degrees of freedom and the neutrino anisotropic stress , both of which cause a damping of the spectrum .",
    "it is notable that our detailed calculations have also revealed a numerical error due to the inaccurate treatment of the effect of neutrino anisotropic stress in previous work ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain a wide range spectrum which shows interesting features produced in the early universe , the inflationary phase and the reheating phase .",
    "we should therefore stress that this is the first work which calculates the amplitude of the gravitational wave background accurately including all of the factors that are definitely understood to affect it .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain an accurate spectral amplitude and is therefore essential for accurately assessing the detectability of the gravitational wave background .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ evogw ] , we begin with the evolution equations expressing gravitational waves in terms of metric tensor perturbations",
    ". then we review the basics of the gravitational wave background spectrum and evaluate the basic spectrum shape analytically . in sec.[evoh ] , we describe the physical phenomena in the early universe that are thought to have affected the spectrum shape . in sec.[ncal ] , we present the results of our numerical calculations of the gravitational wave background spectrum and provide comparisons with theoretical predictions .",
    "we also show the results at different reheating temperatures and different inflation models . in sec.[con ] , we conclude with a discussion of the results of sec.[ncal ] .",
    "gravitational waves in the expanding universe can be described as a transverse - traceless part of the metric perturbation in a friedmann robertson - walker background .",
    "we consider the spatially flat case in which the line element is given by @xmath3 where the tensor perturbations @xmath4 satisfy the transverse - traceless conditions , @xmath5 . applying the metric of this space - time to the perturbed einstein equation @xmath6",
    ", we obtain the equation of motion for gravitational waves @xmath7 where the over - dot describes the time derivative , @xmath8 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath9 is the transverse - traceless part of the anisotropic stress of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the obvious contribution from the anisotropic stress term is the damping effect due to neutrino free - streaming , presented in refs .",
    "we take into account this effect numerically solving the integro - differential equation shown in appendix [ appneu ] .",
    "although there may be other yet unknown free - streaming particles which cause damping at higher frequencies , we do not include such an uncertain component .",
    "we now develop the basics of the gravitational wave background spectrum assuming a perfect fluid @xmath10 for simplicity .",
    "for convenience , we decompose @xmath4 into its fourier modes with the comoving wave number @xmath11 and denote the two independent polarization states as @xmath12 where the polarization tensors @xmath13 satisfies symmetric and transverse - traceless condition and are normalized as @xmath14 .",
    "( [ heq1 ] ) becomes @xmath15 note that , by neglecting the anisotropic stress term , the contribution of other components in the universe appears only through the second term .",
    "this means we can follow the evolution of gravitational waves with eq .",
    "( [ heq2 ] ) simply by computing the hubble expansion rate , the evolution of which is determined by the total energy densities of the background components .",
    "let us briefly explain how the primordial gravitational waves evolve in the expanding universe .",
    "initially , during inflation , the modes of interest were deep inside the hubble horizon ( @xmath16 ) and fluctuating quantum - mechanically . during this phase , the amplitude of @xmath17 is determined according to appendix [ app1 ] , @xmath18 as the universe expands exponentially , the mode crosses outside the horizon ( @xmath19 ) . at this moment , we assume that the quantum fluctuations become classical . using the fact that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ heq2 ] ) becomes dominant compared with the third term , one can easily obtain the solution @xmath20 after the end of inflation , the mode reenters the horizon ( @xmath21 ) and starts to oscillate . in this phase ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath17 is described by the wkb solution ( see appendix [ appwkb ] ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the conformal time defined by @xmath24 .",
    "we now define a dimensionless quantity to characterize the strength of gravitational waves in terms of their energy density @xmath25 and the critical density of the universe @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 in the second step , we have substituted the fourier transformed form of @xmath25 , which is given by the 00-component of the stress - energy tensor as follows , @xmath28 here , we have assumed that the mode is inside the horizon and behaves like eq .",
    "( [ wkb ] ) , which means that the conformal - time derivative of the mode can be regarded as the same as the spatial derivative when taking the spatial average , @xmath29 .",
    "one may define the tensor power spectrum @xmath30 in terms of the primordial tensor power spectrum @xmath31 and the tensor transfer function @xmath32 as @xmath33 then the energy spectrum @xmath34 can be rewritten as @xmath35 this expression is used in previous works because it is useful to evaluate the spectrum by splitting the contributions to the spectrum shapes into two parts , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the spectrum shape is affected by the hubble rate both when the mode leaves the horizon during inflation and when the mode reenters the horizon after inflation .",
    "since @xmath31 is the spectrum at the end of inflation , it contains only the contribution from the former , whereas @xmath32 represents the time evolution of each mode after the end of inflation , which means it contains only the contribution from latter . in most previous work",
    ", @xmath36 has been evaluated analytically using the slow - roll approximation .",
    "we shall return to this in the next section .",
    "we now show two simple examples of frequency dependence of the spectrum  a radiation - dominated and a matter - dominated case  assuming the primordial spectrum is flat , @xmath37 . according to eq .",
    "( [ sphorizon ] ) , @xmath17 remains constant on superhorizon scales .",
    "this means the transfer function can be written in terms of the amplitude of @xmath17 at horizon crossing , @xmath38 , where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes the present time and `` hc '' denotes the horizon - crossing time . after the modes",
    "reenter the horizon , @xmath17 decreases inversely proportional to the scale factor , so that @xmath39 , then we get @xmath40 . therefore , the energy spectrum at the present time is rewritten as @xmath41 . by using the relation @xmath42 , the value @xmath43 in @xmath44",

    ", we shall describe the physics of the early universe which affect the spectrum shape and provide the equations necessary for calculating the evolution of the hubble rate .      in most models of inflation , the accelerated expansion is driven by a scalar field @xmath53 whose equation of motion is given by @xmath54 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath53 .",

    "also , the tensor - to - scalar ratio can be written in terms of @xmath70 , @xmath71 these expressions are used as a reference for comparison with our numerical results in the subsequent section .      during reheating process that follows inflation ,",
    "the energy of the scalar field is transferred to radiation or other light particles oscillating near the minimum of its potential . here ,",
    "we consider the perturbative decay of the scalar field @xcite and only consider the interaction between the scalar field and light fermions .",

    "note that this expression is valid only for the case where the mass of the interacting field and the decay rate @xmath73 is sufficiently smaller than the oscillation frequency of the @xmath53 field .",
    "we do not deal with nonlinear processes like preheating @xcite , which occurs if the decay is bosonic and the parameters satisfy specific conditions @xcite .",
    "such processes may also generate gravitational waves at high frequencies with a quite different spectrum shape , and may even exceed the amplitude of the inflation - produced gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "however , since we aim to provide a conservative estimate of the spectrum , we only consider perturbative processes which exist regardless of the chosen reheating scenario .",

    "( [ reheat1]),([reheat2 ] ) and ( [ reheat3 ] ) , we can simply calculate the hubble rate following the evolution of both the scalar field and the radiation field which are interacting with each other .",
    "reheating ends around @xmath77 where the @xmath53 field begins to decay exponentially . at this stage ,",
    "the universe becomes radiation - dominated , so that we can define the reheating temperature which can be related to @xmath73 @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this value is often used to characterize the reheating process .",
    "after the universe becomes radiation - dominated , the hubble rate basically behaves as @xmath47 . in the early stages of the radiation - dominated era , particles in the universe are relativistic and contribute to the radiation energy density . however , when a particle species becomes nonrelativistic as the universe expands and the temperature decreases , the contribution of the particle species to the radiation drops exponentially and becomes negligible .",
    "this results in the change of the radiation energy density and the evolution of the hubble rate , then induces a damping of the amplitude at high frequencies .",
    "these processes for all particle species are treated in the framework of thermodynamics as changes of the `` effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , '' @xmath80 , which is introduced for the convenience to evaluate the contribution of all relativistic species as a whole .",
    "we take into account this effect with a formulation based on ref .",

    "a notable characteristic of this type of potential is that the decay rate is not constant , because the oscillation frequency of @xmath53 depends on the amplitude of @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is a constant of order 1 @xcite .    in the @xmath171 case",

    "we now consider the original new inflation model which is based on the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite , @xmath173 the oscillation frequency is given by @xmath174 . here",

    "( 1 ) , we find a very similar spectrum to the case of the @xmath179 potential .",
    "by contrast , in case ( 2 ) , the spectrum is quite different .",
    "this difference arises from the difference in the point in the potential at which the @xmath53 field rolls down . in case",
    "( 1 ) , the scalar field rolled down where the potential is quadratic , and this is why the spectrum has almost the same shape as that of the @xmath179 case .    in case",
    "( 2 ) , inflation occurs at a lower energy scale , and the decay rate is set to be smaller , @xmath180 , in order to not exceed the hubble rate during inflation .",
    "the remarkable features of case ( 2 ) are the complete flatness of the spectrum and the smallness of its amplitude .",
    "the flatness is due to the small gradient of the potential because the initial value of @xmath53 is very near zero .",
    "the smallness of the amplitude relates to the flatness of the spectrum , about which we will explain later ( see sec . [ comparison ] ) .      in the case of hybrid inflation ,",
    "the potential is constructed with two scalar fields @xmath53 and @xmath181 @xcite , @xmath182 we consider the usual case where inflation is driven by the @xmath53 field and suddenly ends after the symmetry breaking of the @xmath181 field ( waterfall field ) . to satisfy this condition , we adopt the following parameters : @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186gev . in this case",
    ", the oscillation at the bottom of the potential mainly comes from the @xmath53 field , of which the frequency is @xmath187 , thus we can assume that the radiation energy produced during reheating comes from only the decay of the @xmath53 field .",
    "the spectrum shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ models ] is nearly flat and in good agreement with the taylor - expanded spectrum .",

    "this has become possible by numerically solving the evolution of a scalar field from quantum states during inflation until today taking into account the conversion of the scalar field energy into radiation .",
    "in addition , we have also taken into account the contribution of neutrinos to the anisotropic stress and the temperature dependence of the effective degrees of freedom @xmath0 .",
    "these two effects had already been investigated by ref .",
    "however , we found that a correction is needed for the treatment of the source term in their calculation .",
    "moreover their calculation is limited in terms of frequency range , so that their result is not relevant to the reheating process",
    ". therefore , this is the first calculation that correctly includes all the factors which affect the shape of the gravitational wave background spectrum over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "this comprehensive treatment of the factors enables us to make an accurate estimation of the amplitude of the spectrum , which should be invaluable in making predictions for future experiments .",
    "our estimation shows that the taylor - expanded spectrum of the slow - roll prediction eq .",
    "( [ srspectrum ] ) , which is analytically obtained and used in many previous works , overestimates the amplitude of the spectrum in some models .",

    "it is also notable that the deviation is found even in the frequency region where the slow - roll conditions are satisfied ( around between @xmath293hz and @xmath294hz in the @xmath179 case ) .",
    "this is because the taylor expansion of the spectrum around the cmb scale is no longer a good approximation at these frequencies .",
    "however , since we do not know the normalization of the scalar perturbations at much smaller scales ( @xmath295 ) , it is impossible to carry out a taylor expansion about a high frequency point . therefore the deviation is inevitable as long as we analytically evaluate the spectrum using the taylor expansion as in eq .",

    "we strongly recommend numerical calculation of spectra in order to discuss the detectability of the gravitational wave background .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the spectrum has the characteristic features produced after the end of inflation .",
    "the effect of reheating is observed in the spectrum as a dip at @xmath296hz in the case where the scalar field oscillates in a quadraticlike potential .",
    "this is because the matter - dominated evolution of the universe during reheating causes the frequency dependence of @xmath145 .",
    "this feature is not seen in the case of a quartic potential because of the difference in the evolution of the hubble rate .",
    "in addition , the combination of the effects due to changes in @xmath0 and the neutrino anisotropic stress is observed between @xmath297hz . it should be noted that changes in @xmath0 decrease the amplitude by about half an order of magnitude at higher frequencies , where the above - mentioned features of the early universe notably appear . this damping effect becomes larger in case where there exist susy particles or other exotic particles which cause a change of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that this effect is also important when evaluating the detectability .",
    "finally , we would like to conclude with some prospects for future observations .",
    "when comparing the results of different inflation models , we found that the amplitudes of the three models , both cases of chaotic inflation and case ( 1 ) new inflation , are comparable around the frequencies covered by future experiments like lisa , decigo / bbo and ligoii / lcgt .",
    "thus , to distinguish these models , it may be necessary to measure the tilt of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , interestingly , the frequencies covered by future experiments cover the range in which the spectrum shows an edge due to the effect of the low temperature reheating .",
    "hopefully , they will provide a new insight into understanding of reheating .    also , high frequency gravitational wave background around @xmath291hz , which the new design of detector suggested in ref .",
