    "the lightest chemical element in which beta - delayed proton ( @xmath4p ) emission has been observed so far is carbon , in the decay of @xmath5c .",
    "this paper explores the possibility of seeing the decay mode also in beryllium and boron , more specifically in the decays of @xmath0be and @xmath1b .",
    "these nuclei are the lightest ( not counting the deuteron ) one - neutron and one - proton halo nuclei , respectively , and the possible @xmath4p decays are intimately connected to this structure .",
    "there are two reasons for this connection , the first being the factorization of the wavefunction into a halo and a core part that suggests `` independent decays '' of the two parts @xcite which naturally leads to final states with a continuum proton ; we shall discuss this model in the next section .",
    "the second connection is specific for @xmath6 decays where one can derive the general expression @xcite @xmath7 from which it is seen that the @xmath4p decay only occurs for nuclei with very low neutron separation energy .",
    "similar relations exist for beta - delayed deuteron and triton emission that are known to take place close to the neutron dripline @xcite .",
    "so far @xmath4p decays have only been observed following @xmath8 or ec decays .",
    "general recent reviews of these processes can be found in @xcite .",
    "the following section discusses the characteristics of the proposed decays in more detail including the estimated order of magnitude of the decay rate .",
    "the expected branching ratios are quite low and some general considerations are made on how they could be measured .",
    "sections 3 and 4 give details on first measurements of the decays in @xmath0be and @xmath1b from which upper limits on the branching ratios can be given .",
    "the final section gives our conclusions and the prospects of identifying the two decays .",
    "a crucial feature of halo states is their intrinsic clustering so that ( a major part of ) the wavefunction will factorize into a halo part and a core part @xcite .",
    "formally , the beta - decay can then be thought of in terms of separate decays of the core ( c ) and halo ( h ) parts @xcite @xmath9 but the actual final states will of course in general be superpositions of the two terms on the right side e.g.  to ensure they have proper isospin .",
    "if the states on the right hand side are close to being eigenstates for the final system one would expect a large resemblance between the decays of the core nucleus and the halo nucleus .",
    "experimental confirmation of this idea may be found in the decays of @xmath10be and @xmath11be , which are quite analogous @xcite .",
    "the most recent mass tables @xcite give @xmath12 kev for the decay of @xmath0be , which leaves 281 kev as the energy window for beta - delayed proton emission .",
    "different assumptions on the decay mechanism can give widely different rates @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore present several simplified models that lead to rather straightforward expressions for the decay rate , and start by considering sequential decays as described in r - matrix theory that can handle broad intermediate states .",
    "however , the classical r - matrix expressions may not give a sufficiently accurate description of the decay mechanism .",
    "at the other extreme are models that consider decays to proceed directly to continuum states , as has been assumed for most calculations of the related @xmath4d decays @xcite .    allowed beta decay of @xmath0be will populate @xmath13 and @xmath14 levels in @xmath0b , but since these would decay to @xmath15be+p with s - wave and d - wave protons , respectively , only the @xmath13 states can be expected to give a sizeable contribution . out of the known states @xcite in the excitation energy range 10.012.5 mev the only one that may have spin and parity @xmath13 is a state at 11.444 mev with width 103 kev that has been seen to decay by emission of @xmath16 particles , but where the spin is so far undetermined .",
    "the r - matrix expressions for @xmath4-decay have been derived for several cases , see @xcite and references therein , but we shall here only consider a crude approximation based on the single - channel single - level case in which the energy spectrum is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the decay rates for the proton branch and the total beta decay , @xmath19 the experimental halflife , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the standard weak decay constants @xcite , @xmath22 the beta decay phase space factor , @xmath23 the reduced gamow - teller matrix element squared , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the level energy and width , and @xmath26 the proton penetrability ( @xmath27 being the proton threshold energy ) .",
    "several energy dependent terms in the denominator are here approximated as constants . to take into account that the level can decay",
    "both by emission of @xmath16 particles and protons one should multiply by @xmath28 to get the intensity of the proton spectrum .",
    "this ratio is unknown , but may in the best case ( if the proton width is close to a single - particle width ) reach @xmath29 .",
    "the gt strength @xmath23 can at most be 3 ( the value for a pure neutron to proton decay ) . inserting these maximum values the total branching ratio becomes @xmath30 , but a realistic value could be lower by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the predicted spectrum is given in figure [ fig : e11be ] for the case where the intensity ( the product @xmath31 ) is a factor 50 below the maximum , i.e.  where the branching ratio is @xmath32 .",
    "as an intermediate step we consider next the suggested modification of the r - matrix formalism containing the opposite time ordering @xcite , i.e.  where the neutron is emitted before beta decaying into a proton . as argued by barker @xcite , who presents a more detailed derivation analogous to the way photon emission is treated , this may be a simple way to effectively include the decays to continuum states into the r - matrix framework . in the limit where only the `` emission before decay '' process is included the decay rate becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neutron separation energy in @xmath0be and the parameter @xmath35 quantifies the neutron emission probability . for a decaying level it is related to the level width through @xmath36 and it must be less than the single particle width ( the wigner limit , here 5.8 mev ) .",
    "the total branching ratio is proportional to @xmath35 and is at most @xmath37 . the predicted energy distribution is also plotted in figure [ fig : e11be ] .",
    "finally , the simple model for decays directly to continuum states @xcite gives @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the reduced mass of the outgoing proton and @xmath40 is the channel radius used to evaluate the penetrability .",
    "the gamow - teller strength is now explicitly energy dependent since the final state wavefunction is a continuum state . the expression above results if one uses a plane wave approximation for the final state when calculating @xmath41 .",
    "if one instead uses a coulomb wave the effect of the transmission through the coulomb potential is included in @xmath41 and one must replace the ratio @xmath42 by the wavenumber @xmath43 .",
    "the total branching ratio is in this latter case @xmath44 , the corresponding energy distribution is given in figure [ fig : e11be ] .",
    "more realistic calculations will use distorted waves so that the final state strong interactions are also included . a recent more sophisticated calculation @xcite in a two - body potential model gives a broad energy spectrum peaking at 0.10.2 mev and a branching ratio of @xmath45 .",
    "( this specific calculation includes both fermi and gamow - teller contributions to the decay rate . )    to summarize , the different models predict somewhat different shapes of the energy distribution and give a branching ratio that typically is a few times @xmath46 , but could range up to @xmath47 . to see the decay mode",
    "an experiment therefore needs to be sensitive down to the @xmath46 level , while considerably more intensity will be needed to separate the different models .",
    "turning now to @xmath1b two facts make the decay directly to continuum states less likely here : the smaller spatial extent of the halo in this nucleus and the fact that there is an excited state in @xmath1be within the @xmath4-decay window ( actually the ec - decay window ) that the decay may pass through , namely the @xmath48 @xmath49 state at 17.640 kev .",
    "it is situated 385 kev above the proton threshold and is know to decay mainly by proton emission @xcite .",
    "if equation ( [ eq : fac ] ) is appropriate , we can estimate the matrix element of the transition to be the same as for the ground state decay of @xmath50be into the ground state of @xmath50li ( the larger amplitude of the wavefunction in @xmath1b increases the rate by a factor 2.1 @xcite but this is compensated by a factor 1/2 from the isospin clebsch - gordan coefficient squared ) .",
    "both transitions are electron capture decays for which the phase space goes as the q - value squared , so by scaling the halflife of @xmath50be we obtain an estimate of the branching ratio of the @xmath4p transition of @xmath51 .    direct support for this estimate can be found from the three - cluster calculations in @xcite that predict a @xmath23 to the 17.64 mev state of 1.366 and 1.997 for two different potentials employed .",
    "this is in the same range as the @xmath23 of 1.83 for the @xmath50be ground state transition .",
    "direct detection of these @xmath4p decays is challenging since one has to look for particles of low energy , with a low branching ratio , and where the decay branch has to be identified e.g.  through particle identification ( pid ) techniques .",
    "as an alternative one may try to detect the presence of the daughter nucleus or , more ambitiously , its growing - in . in the cases in question here",
    "the final nucleus is stable or longlived so one can not make use of its decay , but must resort to other methods .",
    "one possibility is accelerator mass spectroscopy ( ams ) as explained in the next section .",
    "a low branching ratio by itself does not prohibit direct detection .",
    "as an example , branching ratios well below @xmath52 have been detected for cluster radioactivity @xcite .",
    "the challenge is rather to identify the decay branch uniquely . for proton kinetic energies below 1 mev one could employ gas telescopes and use the energy loss @xmath53 versus full energy @xmath54 to identify the particle",
    ". however , the energy loss for a proton peaks just below 100 kev energy so the @xmath53-@xmath54 curves for protons , deuterons and tritons will cross in this region , making separation e.g.  between protons and tritons ( relevant for @xmath0be ) impossible .",
    "identification via detection of @xmath54 and time - of - flight is an alternative , but will typically have much less efficiency . separating protons from the background of energy loss signals from beta particles could also be a problem .",
    "if the proton can be recorded in coincidence with the recoiling nucleus this may be used to discriminate against other channels .",
    "this `` ratio cut '' method is useful to separate true events from response tails of events at higher energy , as done in the @xmath55 decay of @xmath56n @xcite and needed here for the case of @xmath1b .",
    "it can also be used to single out one decay channel among many others , as done for the @xmath0li beta - decay to t+@xmath1li @xcite and needed here for @xmath0be .",
    "the main challenge with this method is to obtain efficient detection of the recoil with sufficient accuracy in energy , in the examples given the energy was higher than for our @xmath4p decays .",
    "four beta - delayed particle branches are energetically open for @xmath0be , their q - values are listed in table [ tab : qs ] . we may neglect the @xmath4n branch since it would proceed to the @xmath15b @xmath57 ground state and require a d - wave neutron with very low energy .",
    "the @xmath4 t branch leads to @xmath1be and would therefore give a three - body final state , this could also be a quite interesting decay mode . the main background for the @xmath4p branch will be @xmath55 whose branching ratio was measured to be @xmath58% @xcite ( a recent determination gave @xmath59% @xcite ) .",
    "lcccc @xmath60 & p & n & @xmath16 & t + s@xmath61(@xmath0b ) ( kev)@xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 + @xmath67 ( kev)@xmath62 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 +    @xmath62mass values from ref .",
    "@xcite      due to the challenges involved in direct detection of the @xmath4p decays we decided to explore the possibility of indirect detection .",
    "the @xmath4p - daughter nucleus , @xmath15be , is radioactive with a halflife of @xmath72 years and is only present on earth in minute quantities due to production by cosmic rays .",
    "it is used as a tracer in earth sciences and procedures have been developed for detecting very small samples of @xmath15be via accelerator mass spectroscopy ( ams ) , see e.g.  @xcite . stated briefly",
    ", our experiment then consists in collecting a large number of @xmath0be atoms , measure their number by detecting @xmath73-radiation from the @xmath0be decay and later measure the number of produced @xmath15be atoms via ams .",
    "the @xmath0be source was collected in september 2001 at the isolde facility at cern .",
    "the @xmath0be atoms were produced by proton bombardement in a ta target , ionized by laser ionization @xcite , accelerated and transported to the measuring station where the ion beam passed two sets of collimators before being implanted into a be foil ( goodfellow , ls226536 l c , thickness 0.01 mm , purity 99.8+% ) .",
    "the average intensity of the collected beam was @xmath74 ions / s , the collection took place for close to 40 hours .",
    "the distance from the first collimator to the collection point was 177 mm .",
    "the transmission was optimized with a stable @xmath75na beam and a radioactive @xmath76 mg beam , the fraction of the activity that deposited on the collimator was at most 12% .",
    "most of the decays of @xmath0be proceed through states in @xmath0b that decay by gamma emission , the most prominent @xmath73-ray being the 2124.47 kev line with a total branching ratio , including feeding from higher levels , of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the gamma detection was done with a ge - detector that was placed about 40 cm from the collection point in the opposite direction of the collimator .",
    "it was further shielded by 3 mm pb to reduce the total count rate .",
    "still , the multi channel analyzer used for data taking had a deadtime of @xmath78% determined from the ratio of live time and real time of the data taking system .",
    "the ge detector was energy and efficiency calibrated _ in situ _ with absolutely calibrated sources of @xmath79co , @xmath80cs and @xmath81th that bracket the energies from 239 kev to 2615 kev .",
    "the total gamma spectrum from @xmath0be is shown in figure [ fig : g11be ] .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by gamma lines from the decay of @xmath0be with a small background mainly from @xmath82k and the @xmath83rn decay chain .",
    "the 2124 kev line is clearly separated from background and gives , after correction for detector efficiency and deadtime , a deduced amount of @xmath0be atoms collected of @xmath84 . as a cross - check of this number",
    "we shall look at two other @xmath73-lines recorded from the @xmath0be decay .",
    "first the 2895 kev line that again is nicely separated in our spectra ; we deduce an intensity ratio with respect to the 2124 kev line of @xmath85% in agreement with the literature value of @xmath86% @xcite .",
    "secondly , we consider the 478 kev line that follows @xmath55 decays of @xmath0be to the first excited state in @xmath50li .",
    "the line is therefore recoil broadened and care must be taken when extracting its intensity since it furthermore is situated on top of a large background .",
    "our deduced intensity relative to the 2124 kev transition is @xmath87% .",
    "the literature value for this last ratio can be derived from the decay scheme in @xcite to be 1.13% ( it was not observed directly since gamma detection was done with a nai detector ) . however , as we shall argue now , this value is most likely wrong .",
    "alternative determinations of this ratio measured with ge detectors can be extracted from experiments on the decay of @xmath0li in which @xmath0be is fed . from two such recent experiments",
    "accurate results can be obtained ( although not published previously ) : an experiment we did at isolde @xcite gave @xmath88% and an experiment at triumf @xcite gave @xmath89% .",
    "an unpublished recent @xmath55 experiment @xcite has revised the branching ratio of alpha particles to the 478 kev excited state in @xmath50li to be @xmath90% of all alpha decays , a result based on a detailed analysis of the alpha spectrum but in disagreement with the literature value of @xmath91% @xcite . using the new value one derives a 478/2125 ratio of @xmath92% .",
    "since the three new determinations all are consistent with our value for the ratio , we conclude that our spectra are internally consistent which adds confidence to our derived source intensity",
    ".      the collection foil must of course be free of previous @xmath15be activity , but we also need to worry about contamination coming along with the @xmath0be beam .",
    "the most worrisome contaminant is @xmath0li that can be ionized by surface ionization in the hot cavity where laser ionization of be takes place .",
    "the primary production yield is lower by a factor at least 2000 , but the main decay branch of @xmath0li is beta - delayed one - neutron emission that leads to @xmath15be and suppression of @xmath0li is therefore needed .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath0be and @xmath0li , @xmath93 mev @xcite , is sufficiently big that the resolving power of isolde s high resolution separator hrs , which is up to @xmath94 , can easily separate the two nuclei that have @xmath95 .",
    "a tail of @xmath0li activity may nevertheless be present at the @xmath0be mass position , but we have estimated its magnitude by looking for the corresponding tails of the nuclei @xmath5li and @xmath1li a factor @xmath96 below their nominal setting . in both cases background prevented a direct identification  there are no @xmath73-rays in either decay , so only the ( non - unique ) @xmath4-detection is possible  but a lower limit of the suppression factor of @xmath97 was extracted in both cases .",
    "a second source was collected with the separator deliberately set off - mass by two thirds of the @xmath0li-@xmath0be mass difference ( below the @xmath0be position ) .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath0be gamma lines was here reduced by a factor 500 , consistent with the results at the lower masses .",
    "a further reduction can be obtained by blocking collection for the first 150 ms after the radioactivities are produced by the proton pulse .",
    "most @xmath0li , of halflife 8.5 ms , will have decayed by then .",
    "however , at the end of our collection it was discovered that the onset of the blocking by mistake was delayed by a few ms allowing up to 15% of the @xmath0li to leak through .",
    "thus up to @xmath98 @xmath15be could have contaminated the sample through decay of collected @xmath0li .",
    "a second possible contaminant could be the beh molecule @xmath99h@xmath15be that would be almost on top of the @xmath0be mass since @xmath100 for this case .",
    "it is quite unlikely that this molecule will be formed and ionized in sufficient quantities to be a problem , but the possibility should be kept in mind in future experiments . as will be seen we do not have indications for any of these contaminants in the present sample .",
    "the @xmath15be accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) measurements were performed at the tandem laboratory , uppsala university , in sweden @xcite . a dedicated setup based on a nec 5 mv tandem pelletron accelerator devoted to high",
    "precision and low background detection of @xmath15be was employed .",
    "the measurements were carried out according to the principle presented by middletone and klein @xcite where ion currents were normalized by @xmath101o from the @xmath5be@xmath101o molecule .",
    "the absolute transmission in the ams - system was determined with the nist srm 4325 standard ( @xmath15be/@xmath5be= @xmath102 @xcite ; nist certificates the ratio to be r@xmath103 ) .",
    "the be - foil used in the investigation was divided into three @xmath104 mm@xmath105 samples where one subfoil a was just chemically prepared and used as a blank value representative for the whole ams procedure .",
    "subfoil b and c were both mounted in two aluminium frames with a circular aperture ( diameter 8 mm ) .",
    "both were installed in the isolde facility .",
    "there was no implantation in subfoil b while subfoil c was used as the catcher for @xmath0be .",
    "all three subfoils were chemically prepared by dissolution in hcl followed by precipitation to be(oh)@xmath106 by adding nh@xmath107 which in turn was converted to beo .",
    "finally the beo was mixed with nb as a binder before the ams - analysis in the accelerator .",
    "cccc subfoil & mass ( mg ) & r = r@xmath108/r@xmath109 & @xmath15be ( @xmath110 atoms / mg ) + a ( blank ) & 3.04 & 0.00149(12 ) & 2.67(22 ) + b ( background ) & 3.65 & 0.00152(11 ) & 2.73(20 ) + c ( catcher ) & 4.22 & 0.00169(13 ) & 3.03(23 ) +    a summary of the results is given in table [ tab : ams ] .",
    "no significant difference is observed for the blank and background foils which indicates no additional @xmath15be contamination in the handling in isolde and during transportation .",
    "it is , however , noteworthy to compare the background values for the foil used with what is obtained from our normal be carrier which for 1 mg sample gives a r @xmath111 corresponding to a factor two lower @xmath15be content .",
    "if we use subfoil b as a background to subfoil c the @xmath15be signal can be estimated to be @xmath112 atoms . with a total number of @xmath0be nuclei in the sample of @xmath113 this leads to a deduced branching ratio of @xmath2 where the uncertainty is on the one sigma level .",
    "there is therefore no positive evidence for the @xmath0be @xmath4p decay , only an upper limit of the order of the most optimistic theoretical branching ratios .",
    "the @xmath1b experiment was carried out at the igisol ( ion guide isotope separator on - line ) separator at the accelerator laboratory of university of jyvskyl .",
    "the main aim of this experiment was to determine precisely the neutrino spectrum from the decay of @xmath1b through analysis of the beta - delayed alpha spectrum .",
    "the result of this part of the experiment along with a detailed description of the experimental procedures is described in @xcite ; the set - up consisted of four dsssd detectors each backed by a thick si detector in close geometry around the collection point . as a byproduct the high statistics of the experiment allowed to identify for the first time an electron capture branch in the decay of @xmath1b , namely to the @xmath114 16.922 mev state .",
    "we are here concerned with the possible electron capture branch to the even higher - lying 17.640 mev state .",
    "since the @xmath1b experiment recorded a total of 16 million decays , the expected number of proton detections is 0.36 and we can only report an upper limit",
    ". the 17.640 kev state will decay by emitting a 337 kev proton and a 48 kev recoiling @xmath50li ion that could not be detected .",
    "the main background from the decay will be @xmath16-@xmath16 coincidences at low energy or positrons that happen to deposit around 340 kev in the detector .",
    "the latter background can be suppressed by requiring anti - coincidence with the backing detectors .",
    "the former background needs to be addressed indirectly since the set - up did not include particle identification .",
    "one can suppress the @xmath16 particles by doing anti - coincidence with the opposite dsssd , but to do this efficiently one needs to restrict the solid angle and only consider events close to the center of each dsssd since beta - recoil can cause the @xmath16 coincidences to deviate from a linear geometry .",
    "this reduces the effective solid angle by a factor about 9 .",
    "a small background nevertheless remains , see figure [ fig : sp8b ] , and the 95% confidence level upper limit of the number of counts in a 337 kev peak turns out to be 18 . as seen in the figure there are indications for a peak at 349 kev ; however , the uncertainty on the energy scale is only 7 kev since there were accurately known calibration lines from the decay of @xmath75al close by @xcite",
    ". the 95% confidence level upper limit on the number of counts in the 349 kev peak is 45 .",
    "combing all factors gives an upper limit of @xmath3 on the @xmath4p branching ratio at 95% confidence level . to reach the range of predicted intensity the experiment needs to improve by a factor 1000",
    "one may gain a factor of ten by including particle identification , which will reduce the background in the interesting energy range .",
    "another factor of ten may be obtainable by increasing the effective solid angle , but one still would need a factor of ten higher overall production of @xmath1b ions .",
    "the theoretical estimates in section 2 showed that beta - delayed proton emission in the decays of @xmath0be and @xmath1b is likely to take place with a branching ratio that can be expected to be a few times @xmath46 .",
    "the energies of the emitted proton and the recoiling nucleus will be small .",
    "these two factors make detection of the processes challenging .",
    "we have carried out first experiments to look for these decay branches and have obtained upper limits on the branching ratios .",
    "these do not yet reach the level of the theoretical predictions , improvements are needed by factors of at least @xmath115 and @xmath97 for the two cases .",
    "the continuing improvements of radioactive beam facilities may give increases in the yields that will allow experiments to reach the needed level of sensitivity , but other possible improvements should also be considered . as explained above for @xmath1b changes to a more dedicated set - up should be considered . for the case of @xmath0be",
    "the ams measurement can be considerably improved if the amount of stable be in the sample is reduced .",
    "this can be achieved by using a different catcher foil ( e.g.  cu , au or nb ) and after adding a small amount of be carrier ( @xmath116 mg with low @xmath15be content ) do a refined chemical separation @xcite .",
    "an enhanced sensitivity of two orders of magnitude can be expected from such improved sample handling .",
    "once the decay modes have been established and the branching ratio securely determined , the next important step will be to determine the energy distribution of the emitted protons .",
    "this will give a more sensitive test of the theoretical calculations and may in particular show whether our hypothesis of a direct relation between the @xmath4p decay mode and the halo structure in these two nuclei is correct .",
    "we would like to thank i. mukha and l. grigorenko for discussions and f. sarazin for communicating non - published results on the @xmath0li decay .",
