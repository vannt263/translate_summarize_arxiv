    "energy efficient networking principles have received significant attention in the recent past .",
    "network devices are often provisioned with multiple transmit power levels , but are limited by peak as well as average energy constraints .",
    "these constraints are determined by factors such as amplifier characteristics , energy costs and battery limitations .",
    "consequently , one needs efficient control strategies aimed at achieving different performance objectives such as maximizing network lifetime , or maximizing network throughput while satisfying the energy constraints for the network .",
    "conversely , in many scenarios , one wants to guarantee a certain network throughput region , while minimizing long term average energy expended to sustain any admissible arrival rate . in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of link scheduling over a wireless network in the presence of average energy constraints .",
    "owing to the high computational complexity of the optimal policies , we propose low complexity energy efficient link scheduling and power control policies .",
    "we exploit the property of longest queue first ( lqf)-based algorithms to develop a low - complexity greedy power control and scheduling scheme ( gecs ) for wireless networks under binary interference models .",
    "we then analyze its performance in wireless networks and show that their performance can be characterized using the lpf of a wireless network .",
    "we thus show that the lpf can be used to characterize the performance of cross - layer schemes , spanning multiple layers .",
    "a link scheduler selects a non - interfering subset of links in a wireless network to schedule at every instance .",
    "a throughput optimal link scheduler is one that keeps the queues in the network stable for the largest set of admissible arrival rates for that network .",
    "however , when constraints on average transmission power are imposed , a link scheduler could end up expending more average power than necessary , even when the arrival rate is admissible , as seen from the following example : consider a single link in which one can either transmit 2 packets in a time slot by expending 2 units of power , or 1 packet in a time slot by expending 0.75 units of power .",
    "consider an arrival process where two packets arrive at the start of every other time slot .",
    "the link scheduler would cause the link to transmit whenever there are packets in the queue , _",
    "i.e. , _ every other time slot , consequently requiring an average power of 2 units .",
    "if the average power constraint was less than one units , the link scheduler would be unable to meet the power constraint , whereas by transmitting one packet in each time slot one would consume a lesser average power of 0.75 units and yet guarantee the same throughput .",
    "the same limitations of the link scheduler carries over to the scenario in which multiple interfering links are present .",
    "thus , link scheduling needs to be combined with an effective power control strategy in order to ensure that the largest set of admissible arrival rates can be stabilized while meeting average energy requirements .",
    "the optimal link scheduling and power control policy , proposed in @xcite however , suffers from high computation complexity , which is also one of the main challenges in optimal link scheduling .",
    "it is thus natural to ask if one can design low - complexity link scheduling and power control policies , motivated by the study of low - complexity link schedulers . in this context",
    ", our contribution is that we extend the scope of greedy schedulers such as longest - queue - first and greedy maximal scheduling @xcite to handle energy constraints in wireless networks .",
    "our link scheduling and power control policy , gecs , is based on properties of both greedy schedulers as well as optimal schedulers .",
    "interestingly , we are able to characterize the performance of gecs in terms of the lpf of a network graph , a parameter that has been used to characterize the performance of gms in wireless networks .",
    "previous studies have focused on energy efficiency in a particular aspect of network control , ( e.g. , energy efficient routing , or energy efficient mac protocols ) as well as over control decisions spread across the network layers ; for instance , @xcite and @xcite consider the problem of joint routing , scheduling and power control in wireless networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors develop a power control and link scheduling policy that minimizes total average power , while satisfying minimum rate constraints over each link .",
    "the optimal policy has high computational complexity , exponential in general .",
    "the model moreover does not consider the stochasticity of arrivals and dynamic queue control . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a low complexity approximation algorithm to solve the joint routing , scheduling and power control problem in wireless networks under a node - exclusive interference model .    while the above network optimization problems assume that the long term average rate constraints are known , this is not true in general .",
    "stochastic network optimization considers the problem of dynamic queue control in the presence of unknown arrival rates in order to optimize some quantity such as total average expended power .",
    "stochastic network optimization problems have been addressed using stochastic gradient techniques ( @xcite ) or lyapunov optimization techniques @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a lyapunov drift based optimization technique was used to obtain asymptotically optimal policies that minimized the total average power for any arrival rate feasible under the peak power constraints .",
    "lyapunov based optimization has also been used in energy constrained scheduling , where the objective is to maximize the network throughput region ( set of stabilizable arrival rates ) subject to average energy constraints .",
    "subsequently , such techniques have been used in dynamic channel acquisition and scheduling to minimize energy ( @xcite , @xcite ) consumed for transmission as well as channel acquisition , or to maximize throughput when only limited channel information may be acquired by a link . in all these studies however , the optimal policy has high computational complexity motivating the study of low complexity algorithms with good performance guarantees . while low complexity approximation algorithms have been proposed in specific interference models @xcite , or for specific networks@xcite , finding a low complexity dynamic control algorithm with good performance guarantees remains largely unaddressed .    in the context of link scheduling , the lqf policy , and its variant greedy",
    "maximal scheduling ( gms ) have been analyzed extensively as low - complexity scheduling policy for wireless networks .",
    "the performance of gms has been characterized recently using the local pooling factor , a graph theoretic parameter , and lpf has been studied for a large class of graphs and interference models @xcite .",
    "it is thus beneficial to integrate power control with existing greedy link scheduling policies . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the system model .",
    "we then describe and analyze the gecs policy in sections ii and iii respectively .",
    "we consider a wireless network represented by a network graph @xmath0 . for simplicity ,",
    "we initially consider wireless networks with single - hop traffic , so that each link @xmath1 is a source - destination pair .",
    "we assume that link @xmath1 is associated with interference set @xmath2 , so that if link @xmath1 is active , then no other link in @xmath2 can be active .",
    "every link @xmath1 is associated with a peak transmit power constraint .",
    "we also assume that a transmitter can transmit using a discrete set of power levels @xmath3 .",
    "these discrete power levels are chosen from a convex rate - power curve represented by a function @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the power required to transmit at rate @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath4 depends on the channel conditions of link @xmath1 , which are assumed to be static for the wireless network .",
    "for example , in the case of an awgn channel with a bandwidth @xmath6 , noise spectral density @xmath7 , and a power gain @xmath8 , , the power consumed for a rate @xmath5 is given by @xmath9 ( assuming gaussian codewords with average power @xmath10 ) .",
    "the rates corresponding to the available transmit power levels are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "we further assume that each link is also associated with an average power constraint @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that time is slotted so that @xmath14 is the power consumed during time slot @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the queue of link @xmath1 into which packets arrive at the beginning of every time slot .",
    "packets arrive into queue @xmath16 according to an i.i.d .",
    "process with finite mean @xmath17 .",
    "for a given transmission vector @xmath18 , let @xmath19 denote the rate allocation vector achieved by using @xmath18 in time slot @xmath15 .",
    "we define a rate allocation vector @xmath20 as being feasible if it satisfies interference constraints , _",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the set of all feasible rate allocation vectors and power allocation vectors for the network .",
    "a scheduling policy @xmath24 selects a feasible power allocation vector in each time slot @xmath15 .     and",
    "@xmath25 represent the maximum admissible arrival rate for the two links .",
    "the stability region @xmath26 is the region enclosed within dotted lines . ]",
    "let @xmath27 denotes the vector of avaerage power constraints for all links .",
    "the power constrained stability region @xmath26 can be then defined as @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent component wise inequalities .",
    "[ fig : twolink ] shows @xmath26 for a simple two link network graph with transmit power levels @xmath31 and average power constraints @xmath32 .",
    "links @xmath33 and @xmath34 belong to each other s interference sets .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the highest admissible arrival rate for link @xmath1 .",
    "note that when the available transmit power levels for each link @xmath1 is increased to @xmath36 , then the power constrained stability region increases as well , so that @xmath37 .",
    "this follows from the convexity of rate - power curve @xmath4 .",
    "when the average power constraint @xmath38 is set to @xmath39 , then every link @xmath1 could always transmit at maximum power @xmath39 when scheduled , and no power control would be necessary . otherwise ,",
    "when @xmath40 , then a joint link scheduling and power control policy is required even when the link channel conditions are static .",
    "we are interested in a joint power control and link scheduling policy that can stabilize the queues in the network for any arrival ate vector in @xmath26 while satisfying the power constraints .    in order to satisfy the average power constraints",
    ", we employ virtual power queues for each link , as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "every link @xmath1 keeps a virtual queue @xmath41 that is used to track the excess power expended beyond the link s power constraint @xmath42 .",

    "an optimal scheduling policy is one which can stabilize any @xmath46 , while ensuring that the power constraints in each link are satisfied .",

    "describes a max - weight policy as the solution maximizes the sum of weights of each link in the selected transmission power vector , where the weight of link @xmath1 is given by @xmath48 .",
    "the max - weight scheduler is known to be np - hard in many cases including k - hop interference models @xcite .",
    "this motivates the need for a low complexity power control and link scheduling policy with good performance guarantees .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe our link scheduling and power control policy , the greedy energy constrained scheduler ( gecs ) .",
    "the gecs scheduler exploits the properties of both lqf as well as maxweight policies in order to perform link scheduling and power control .",
    "the gecs scheduler first greedily selects links , based on the queue weights @xmath49 .",
    "it then assigns power levels optimally to the selected link , by applying the optimal power control strategy in as if link @xmath1 alone is active .",
    "this procedure continues until no more links remain to be selected .",
    "the gecs scheduler can be formally described as follows :    * select @xmath50 . *",
    "the selected power level satisfies : @xmath51 * the scheduler then sets @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , for all @xmath54 .",
    "the set z is also updated to remove links interfering with @xmath1 from @xmath55 . * if @xmath56 , then repeat step 1 .    in step 1 as well as step 3 ,",
    "the gecs policy breaks ties randomly .",
    "note that step 2 is only performed on links selected in step 1 , and does not increase the computational complexity of the greedy policy , which is @xmath57 considering a centralized implementation .",
    "the following example illustrates the gecs policy on a 6-cycle network graph under the one - hop interference model .",

    "[ fig : six - link - graph ] with links @xmath33 to @xmath58 .",

    "suppose at time @xmath15 , the @xmath61 $ ] , and @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "since link @xmath58 has the highest weight @xmath63 , gecs selects link @xmath58 first .",
    "however , in step 3 , the transmit power level that maximizes the weight of link @xmath58 is 0 . thus @xmath58 is not scheduled .",
    "the next highest weight belongs to @xmath64 and link @xmath64 is added to the schedule . under the one - hop interference model , links @xmath34 and @xmath65 are interfering links and can not be scheduled .",
    "the scheduler then deactivates link @xmath66 , and schedules link @xmath33 . at the end of this procedure ,",
    "the rate allocation vector is @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "note that gecs does not necessarily yield a schedule that is a maximal matching on the graph @xmath68 .",
    "the intuition behind the performance of the gecs scheduler can be explained using the properties of the lqf and the optimal policies . for any arrival rate vector inside @xmath69",
    ", the optimal policy causes the drift of a quadratic lyapunov function to be negative .",
    "the lqf policy , on the other hand causes the set of longest queues to decrease in the fluid limit if the local pooling conditions are satisfied  @xcite .",
    "since the gecs scheduler combines lqf ( for link selection ) and the optimal policy ( for power control ) , one expects gecs to cause the drift of a quadratic function to be negative whenever certain local pooling conditions are satisfied .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case , although local pooling occurs in a manner different from @xcite . nevertheless , the local pooling enables characterizing the performance of gecs using the lpf . in the next section ,",
    "we analyze the performance of gecs and make these relations precise .",
    "we analyze the performance of the gecs scheduler by characterizing its efficiency ratio . the efficiency ratio of gecs is defined as the largest fraction of @xmath69 , that can be stabilized by gecs .",
    "we show that the efficiency ratio of gecs is can be related to the lpf of a network graph , which depends on the topology of the network and the interference model .",

    "+ the lpf @xmath84 , for the network is then defined as : @xmath85 _    in theorem [ theorem 1 ] , we show that the efficiency ratio of the @xmath86 policy for a network graph @xmath68 is lower bounded by the lpf @xmath84 of @xmath68 .",
    "[ theorem 1 ] consider a network graph @xmath68 with lpf @xmath87 .",

    "the proof is given in appendix a. although gecs is also in the spirit of the lqf policy , we use a lyapunov function @xmath89 , that is different from the ones used for lqf and gms in @xcite .",
    "the performance guarantees of gecs in terms of lpf is attractive as the lpf has been extensively studied in context of characterizing the performance of gms in wireless networks @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite , for instance identifies all network graphs whose lpf is 1 under node - exclusive interference models .",
    "here we show that the lpf can be used to characterize the performance of a joint power controller and scheduler , rather than only the scheduler .",
    "this is a step towards a complete performance characterization of cross - layer schemes with a single parameter .",

    "[ fig : six - link - graph ] . for the same network graph",
    ", we also simulate the performance of another candidate greedy scheduler , which we call greedy max - weight ( gmw ) .",
    "gmw is a greedy approximation of the optimal policy in that gives priority to the link with the highest weight @xmath90 .",
    "it then proceeds by removing interfering links and repeating this process until no other interfering links remain to be scheduled .",

    "since the lpf of the network graph is 2/3 , we expect gecs to simultaneously schedule one third the maximum admissible arrival rate on each link @xmath1 ( since by scheduling 3 of the 6 links at a time , half the maximum admissible arrival rate is admissible for every link ) this is indeed seen to be the case .",
    "although performance guarantees for the gmw policy have not been analyzed using the lpf as we did for gecs in the previous section , the plots show that gecs performs better than gmw at higher loads , and reduces the average sum queue size by 30 - 75% .",
    "this could be attributed to the fact that gmw only looks at the difference in queue weights and may be insensitive to links that have long queue lengths but with relatively low weight values .",
    "in this paper , we addressed the problem of link scheduling and power control for wireless networks under average power constraints . owing to the high computational complexity of the optimal policy",
    ", we extended the scope of greedy link schedulers to handle average power constraints for wireless networks under a binary interference model .",
    "we proposed a greedy link scheduling and power control scheme , gecs , and show that the efficiency ratio of gecs for any wireless network is lower bounded by the local pooling factor ( lpf ) of the network graph .",
    "lpf has been previously used to characterize the performance of certain greedy schedulers , separately from the rest of the system . here",
    ", we show that lpf can be used to characterize the performance of cross - layer schemes , spanning multiple layers .",
    "some interesting future directions include analyzing the performance of gecs under fading channels , and under more general interference models .",
    "we prove theorem 1 by identifying a lyapunov function and showing that its drift is negative for the fluid limit model of the system .",
    "we note that the queuing network can be described using a suitably defined markov process , where the states are defined by residual inter - arrival times , residual service times , and queue lengths for all queues in the network .",
