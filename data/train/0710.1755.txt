    "there are several mechanisms that can lead to the production of kaon  antikaon pairs in nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions near threshold . these can be divided mainly into two general classes involving ( a ) the production of a non  strange meson that subsequently decays into @xmath5 , and ( b ) the associated production of @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 is formed through the decay of the hyperon @xmath8 .",
    "the most prominent meson that is found almost exclusively in the @xmath9 channels is , of course the @xmath0 , and there have been measurements of the @xmath10 reaction from disto  @xcite and cosy ",
    "anke  @xcite , as well as of the @xmath11 reaction  @xcite .",
    "these experiments show strength also away from the region of the @xmath0 peak that could arise from other mesons decaying into @xmath12 .",
    "the lightest of the non  strange scalar mesons are the @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which decay mainly into @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "since the central mass values fall almost exactly at the @xmath5 threshold , the strong coupling to this channel distorts significantly the upper parts of the mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "it has even been suggested that both resonances might be mainly molecular in nature  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath12 system is a mixture of isospin @xmath18 and @xmath19 , one can consider whether the non@xmath0 events observed in  might be linked to the production and decay of the @xmath20 and/or the @xmath21 mesons .",
    "the @xmath19 channel is isolated cleanly by looking at the @xmath22 reaction  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we can also expect kaon pairs to be created in the @xmath23 reaction , where the hyperon decays through @xmath24 .",
    "there are , of course , several excited hyperons that could contribute to such a process . of particular interest for low energy production",
    "are the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 .",
    "though nominally lying below the sum of the @xmath2 and @xmath27 masses , their large widths ( @xmath28mev / c@xmath17 ) ensure that they overlap the threshold  @xcite .",
    "results have recently been presented on the production of these states in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 reactions , where the hyperons were detected in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 channels , respectively  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being involved in a direct production mechanism , the @xmath26 and the @xmath25 might also lead to a significant final state interaction ( _ fsi _ ) in the  reaction .",
    "evidence that the  _ fsi _ is indeed important is to be found in the measurement of the cross section at energies below the @xmath0 threshold  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the invariant masses of the final system were on average lower than those of the @xmath1 pairs and it was suggested that this is due to the strong attraction in the  system .",
    "it is therefore an interesting but open question whether the  data from the non@xmath0 region should be viewed , in first approximation , as scalar resonance production _ via _ @xmath33 or hyperon production through @xmath34 .",

    "the events that come from the non@xmath0 region in the 2.65gev data allow us to fix the parameter @xmath35 necessary to describe the @xmath36 ratio within our final state interaction model .",
    "the data are mainly sensitive to the magnitude @xmath37 and the value obtained is not dissimilar to that required to describe free scattering .",
    "the approach reproduces also our results at the other two energies as well as the cosy11 data .",
    "if allowance is made for the small possible contribution to this ratio from @xmath0 events , of the order of 20% , the two  particle ratio is also well described for all @xmath12 mass intervals .",

    "[ kpp2],width=218 ]    there is a striking preference for low @xmath38 masses in both @xmath12 intervals and this behavior is reproduced quantitatively by our simulation , which uses the same effective scattering length @xmath35 that was chosen to describe the two ",

    "[ kpp ] does not necessarily imply that the @xmath2 forms a bound state with the two protons  @xcite .    though the error bars are considerably larger at the two higher energies , as seen in fig .",
    "[ kpp2 ] , the simulation is consistent with the results . in all these three  particle mass distributions",
    "the introduction of a small amount of _ fsi _ for the products of the @xmath0 decay seems to be of less importance than for the @xmath58 spectra .",
    "the total cross section results for both @xmath0 and non@xmath0 production are given in table  [ table1 ] for the three energies .",
    "the systematic errors given here arise from the quadratic sum of the uncertainties in the background subtraction , acceptance correction , tracking efficiency correction for kaons ( 3% ) and the analysis of the @xmath40elastic data used for the normalization .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath40 database is very limited in our region of angle and energy .",
    "this is recognized in the recent sp07 update to the said program where it is stated that _ our solution should be considered at best qualitative between 2.5 and 3gev _",
    "the raw sp07 solution generally overestimates the values of those @xmath40 differential cross sections that are available in this range  @xcite .",
    "a normalization option has to be chosen to ensure agreement with the @xmath40 experimental data and this typically leads to reductions of about 15% at our two lower energies but almost 20% at 2.83gev . to eliminate any ambiguities , the values that we have assumed for the @xmath40 elastic cross section , integrated over the solid angle defined by @xmath96 ,",

    "the @xmath0 cross section has been corrected for the 49.1% branching ratio  @xcite . for both channels",
    "the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the values that we have taken for @xmath101 , the integral of the proton  proton elastic cross section over the solid angle range @xmath102 , are also given .",
    "the associated @xmath103 uncertainty has not , however , been compounded with the other errors . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the value that we obtain for the luminosity at 2.65gev on the basis of the @xmath40 cross section given in the table could be checked using a novel technique  @xcite .",
    "this depends upon the energy loss of the coasting proton beam caused by its multiple traversals through the very thin target .",
    "the resultant frequency change can be measured with high accuracy using the spectrum of the schottky noise . combined with measurements of the beam current , this yielded luminosities with an expected precision of about @xmath104 .",
    "the two methods give consistent results within this uncertainty and , although the frequency  change technique could not be applied as reliably at the higher energies , it is expected that the overall luminosity uncertainty is on about this level .",
    "our total cross section results for non@xmath0 production are plotted in fig .",
    "[ totalxsec ] along with results taken from disto  @xcite and cosy11  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that four  body phase space can not describe simultaneously the  data at high and low excess energies .",
    "the situation is improved only a little if account is taken of the strong attraction between the two protons in the @xmath68 state but a greater improvement is achieved through the introduction of the _ fsi _ in the system .",
    "nevertheless , the cosy11 data at excess energies of 20mev or less still seem to be underestimated .",
    "this might be connected to the incomplete description of the @xmath12 spectra of fig .",
    "[ spectrum_kk ] at very low invariant masses .",
    "however , it must be stressed that in the evaluation of the cosy11 acceptance no account was taken of any _",
    "fsi_.    = 1.1",
    "we have investigated the  reaction at three energies . in those parts of the @xmath12 mass spectra where @xmath0 production is small",
    ", we find a marked difference between the and @xmath1 invariant  mass distributions .",
    "there is a strong peaking in the @xmath36 ratio towards the @xmath58 threshold for both the cosy11 and our data .",
    "this clearly indicates that the  reaction can not be dominated by the undistorted production of a _ single _ scalar resonance @xmath20 or @xmath21 . either a mixture of the two is produced or one of the kaons from the @xmath105 decay interacts with a final proton .",
    "as we have shown , these data can be explained quantitatively through the introduction of a simple final state interaction .    in kinematic regions where @xmath0 production is significant ,",
    "the @xmath106 asymmetry is reduced because the meson may travel some distance before decaying .",
    "our data in such conditions are well fit by assuming that about 20% of the @xmath2 from the @xmath0 decay interact with one or both final protons .",
    "the uncertainty in this is , however , quite large because of the limited precision with which the @xmath0 contribution to the @xmath12 mass spectrum can be isolated .",
    "there is no universal technique for modelling the _ fsi _ when more than one pair of particles is involved .",
    "the product _ ansatz _ has the benefit that the same simulation with the same parameters reproduces also the strong peaking in the ratio of the @xmath39 mass distributions .",
    "we find an effective scattering length that is of the same order of magnitude as that needed to describe the free scattering data  @xcite .",
    "however , the error bars are large and our data are primarily sensitive to @xmath37 rather than its phase .",
    "it is important to stress that we do not know the relative strengths for the production of isospin @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairs in the  reaction and hence the relative weights of @xmath20 and @xmath78 .",
    "some information on this might come from looking at the data on the @xmath107 and @xmath108 reactions taken at 2.83gev  @xcite .",
    "however , even this would not give access to the phase between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 amplitudes .",
    "it must also be stressed that we have neglected any energy dependence of the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "another important _ caveat _ is that we have not considered any possible interaction of the @xmath47 with the protons .",
    "although there is no evidence for any strong effect of this nature in the @xmath109 reaction  @xcite , since the @xmath1 interaction is repulsive , its neglect might be interpreted as extra attraction in the system .",
    "we have clearly shown the importance of the interaction , which is possibly related to the @xmath26 or the @xmath110 , but we must now ask whether there is any evidence for effects that might be connected with the production of the @xmath105 resonances .",
    "the simulation of the energy dependence of the total cross section for the production of the non@xmath0 component in the  reaction underestimates the cosy11 data very near threshold .",
    "even more intriguing , and possibly connected , are the lowest mass points in the @xmath12 spectra . at all three energies shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_kk ] , these points lie much higher than the simulations and a similar behavior is visible in the disto results  @xcite as well as in our data on the @xmath111 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the mass scale of the variation is not that of the widths of the scalar resonances , which are quite large .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that this structure might be due to the opening of the @xmath62 channel at a mass of @xmath112mev / c@xmath17 , which induces some cusp structure that changes the energy dependence of the total cross section near threshold  @xcite .",
    "this would require a very strong @xmath113 channel coupling , which might be driven by the @xmath105 resonances .",
    "thus , although the  reaction may not be ideal for investigating the properties of scalar states , their indirect effects might still be crucial .",
    "given that the @xmath2 is strongly attracted to protons , it is natural to expect that similar _",
    "effects should exist for other reactions .",
    "the @xmath114 ratio in the @xmath115 reaction does indeed show a very strong enhancement near the @xmath116 threshold  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation is , however , slightly more complex because spin  parity constraints means that there must be at least one @xmath27wave in the final state , even at low energies .",
    "unfortunately , the momo data on @xmath117he  @xcite can not be used to isolate any @xmath118he interaction because the charges of the kaons were not identified and only averaged spectra could be studied  @xcite .",
    "there is currently an overall uncertainty in our values of the cross sections because of the limitation in the proton  proton elastic scattering database in our region of energy and angle , though we hope that this will be alleviated by future measurements  @xcite . with our new estimates for the luminosity ,",
    "the @xmath0production cross sections are reduced compared to those of our first analysis  @xcite , which relied upon the non ",
    "renormalized 2004 said solution  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the better separation of the @xmath0 and non@xmath0 events goes by chance in the same direction .",
    "these two effects lower the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath119 production in proton  proton collisions near threshold so that it is now only about a factor of six above the okubo  zweig ",
    "iizuka limit  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the cosy machine crew for their support as well as that of other members of the anke collaboration .",
    "discussions with j.  haidenbauer , c.  hanhart and a.  sibirtsev were very helpful and those with i.  strakovsksy provided important clarifications on the uncertainties in the said @xmath40 procedure above 2.5gev .",

    "this work has been supported in part by the bmbf , dfg , russian academy of sciences , and cosy ffe .",
    "when two particles interact strongly in the final state , the resulting matrix element involves an average of a production operator with the relative wave function @xmath120 of the strongly interacting pair .",
    "if the interaction is of very short range , the wave function may be evaluated at the origin to leave an enhancement factor @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the relative momentum in the pair and @xmath123 is the @xmath124wave jost function  @xcite . in the commonly used scattering length approximation ,",
    "one retains only the linear term in @xmath63 , in which case @xmath125 , where @xmath35 is the scattering length of the interacting pair .    on the other hand ,",
    "if two or more pairs of particles interact in the final state , there is no reliable prescription to evaluate an analogous enhancement factor since a three  body equation then needs to be solved .",
    "if we denote the interacting pairs as 12 and 13 , the corresponding wave function will be @xmath126 .",
    "we now make the _ ad hoc _ assumption that this wave function factorizes in the form @xmath127 in this case , the three  body enhancement factor is simply the product of the two  body factors , evaluated at the appropriate relative momenta : @xmath128    it must be stressed that eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) is merely an _",
    "ansatz _ to try to understand our ensemble of data and , even if it provides a satisfactory description of these , this does not mean that it is applicable more generally .",
    "however , it has also been used to treat the @xmath129 reaction near threshold , where all the final pairs of particles interact strongly  @xcite .",
    "the approach does retain the necessary pole structure when @xmath130 and similarly for @xmath131 .",
    "thus particle-1 can interact simultaneously with both 2 and 3 .",
    "furthermore , to lowest order in the momenta , the _ ansatz _ corresponds to the scattering length of particle1 from a composite 2 + 3 with the desired combined scattering length of @xmath132 .    although the @xmath124wave @xmath40 interaction is well known , the interaction is far more complex because of the channel couplings to @xmath133 and also because there are two isospins @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in a recent study , within a chiral su(3 )",
    "unitary approach  @xcite , data leading to a variety of channels have been fit and values of the ( complex ) scattering lengths deduced for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "their _ full model _ resulted in @xmath134 these values describe the rapid drop in the elastic amplitudes from threshold .    if isospin breaking induced by the significant mass differences is neglected , the scattering length @xmath135 .",
    "however , this is not necessarily the parameter that is relevant for the analysis of the @xmath136 because it is not clear whether the reaction mechanism preferentially excites @xmath18 or @xmath19 @xmath137 states or some combination thereof .",
    "the values in eq .",
