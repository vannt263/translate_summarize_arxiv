    "<S> the dominant form of energy governing the transitions these experiments probe is nuclear electrostatic energy , although violations of the eep due to other forms of energy ( virtually all of which are associated with baryonic matter ) have also been estimated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> potential violations of the eep due to effects such as vacuum energy shifts , which are peculiarly quantum - mechanical in origin ( _ i.e. _ are due solely to radiative corrections ) are not as well understood . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 measures the degree of eep violation , with `` 0 '' denoting the functions evaluated at the atomic system s center of mass and @xmath23 being the ratio of the limiting speed of electrons to the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> the natural scale for @xmath24 is set by the magnitude of @xmath25 , which empirically is much smaller than unity @xcite , permitting us to perform a perturbative analysis in @xmath24 and @xmath26 of the radiative corrections associated with the action ( [ 3 ] ) .    perturbatively solving the field equations associated with ( [ 3 ] ) for the @xmath27 produced by a pointlike nucleus of charge @xmath28 at rest in the moving frame yields @xcite @xmath29\\phi \\equiv\\phi+\\xi\\phi ' \\nonumber\\\\ \\vec a&=&\\frac{\\xi}{2}[\\vec u+\\hat n(\\vec u\\cdot\\hat n)]\\phi\\equiv\\xi\\vec a\\,'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . </S>",

    "<S> the contribution in eq.([al ] ) from the dirac part of the energy ( proportional to @xmath85 ) , produces an overall shift only . assuming that eep - violating contributions to @xmath86 are bounded by the current level of precision for the lamb shift @xcite , and that @xmath87 @xcite , we find the dominant contribution to ( [ al ] ) is due to the purely radiative part of ( [ edq ] ) , yielding the bound @xmath88 . </S>",

    "<S> improvement on such bounds will be a challenge to experimentalists because of the intrinsic uncertainties of excited states of hydrogenic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> setting empirical bounds on @xmath76 will involve measuring the frequency shifts of an atomic clock based on the lamb shift transition , either by comparing two such transitions at different points in a gravitational potential or by performing a ` clock - comparison ' type of experiment between a ` lamb - shift clock ' and some other atomic frequency standard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former experiment would appear unfeasible since the anticipated redshift in the background potential of the earth ( @xmath89 ) is much smaller than any foreseeable improvement in the precision of lamb - shift transition measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one would at least need to perform the experiment in a stronger gravitational field ( such as on a satellite in close solar orbit ) with 1 - 2 orders - of - magnitude improvement in precision . </S>",
    "<S> the latter measurement is , in principle , sensitive to the absolute value of the local potential @xcite , whose magnitude has recently been estimated to be @xmath90 due to the local supercluster @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best hope would appear to be in exploiting anticipated improvements in precision @xcite to obtain better bounds on @xmath24 via ( [ edq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our calculation has assumed that positrons and electrons have equivalent couplings to the gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> if we drop this assumption @xcite , we find that there is an additional contribution to ( [ edq ] ) due to @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution is due entirely to radiative corrections . making the same comparisons as above </S>",
    "<S> , we find the most stringent bound on this quantity to be @xmath92 from present experiments . in a similar vein , one could also consider tests of the eep for muonic atoms to obtain bounds on @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall report on this elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsically quantum - mechanical character of the radiative corrections will , we hope , motivate the development of new eep experiments based on the lamb shift transition , thereby extending our understanding of the validity of the equivalence principle into the regime of quantum - field theory . </S>"
