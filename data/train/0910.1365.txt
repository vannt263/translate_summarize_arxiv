    "entanglement is a profound phenomenon which intrigued scientists with both its rich mathematical structure and its deep philosophical implications . in the last two decades it has also come into prominence as a key resource in quantum communication and quantum computation@xcite .",
    "quantifying entanglement is one of the main problems of quantum information theory .",
    "although for bipartite pure states entanglement measures are well established , quantification of mixed state and multipartite pure state entanglement still contain many unresolved issues@xcite . for multipartite states , not only the amount but also",
    "the flavor of entanglement becomes pertinent .",
    "for example , for three qubits there are two distinct flavors of genuine tripartite entanglement represented by the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states which can never be converted into each other@xcite .",
    "the essential property that is not present or lacking a proper analogue in these settings is the schmidt decomposition .",
    "still , a number of important applications require a proper measure for systems beyond the bipartite pure setting and the challenge continues .",
    "a considerable number of multipartite entanglement measures are generalizations of bipartite measures .",
    "geometric measure of entanglement@xcite is one of them .",
    "it is introduced by shimony @xcite and generalized to multipartite states by barnum and linden@xcite .",
    "wei and goldbart extended it to multipartite mixed states by employing the convex roof construction@xcite .",
    "for a pure state @xmath0 , the geometric distance is defined as the minimum distance between @xmath0 and the set of product states@xcite , i.e. , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the set of normalized product states . even though the distance has a clear geometric meaning , an entanglement monotone@xcite",
    ", i.e. , a quantity which never increase on the average under local quantum operations assisted with classical communication ( locc ) is more useful in applications .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 satisfies this property@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is related to the geometric distance by a monotone increasing function as @xmath4    the geometric measure is used in a number of applications for expressing the degree of entanglement .",
    "it is related to the groverian measure of entanglement@xcite , a quantity which measures the degree of success in grover s search algorithm@xcite as a function of the initial entangled state used .",
    "it is also involved , along with some other distancelike measures , in an upper bound expression on the maximum number of multipartite states that can be discriminated by locc@xcite .",
    "recently , it is shown that for measurement - based quantum computing , too much entanglement in the initial state , as measured by the geometric measure , is detrimental for the quantum speedup gained over classical algorithms@xcite .",
    "finally , the geometric measure has also found applications in many - body physics@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the distance of the state @xmath0 to more general sets @xmath2 other than the product states for the purpose of generalizing the geometric measure . in this way ,",
    "it is possible to quantify the flavor of entanglement more directly ; i.e. , the degree of the difference of the entanglement in state @xmath0 from those of the states in @xmath2 can be measured by @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to this , when the state @xmath0 is desired to be approximated by states in @xmath2 , the maximum achievable fidelity is deficient by @xmath5 from the absolute maximum @xmath6 .",
    "for example , there might be situations where the state @xmath0 is required in a particular quantum communication or computation task ; but it may be too difficult to establish this state between distant parties .",
    "instead , states in the set @xmath2 could be easily established with little cost . for such cases ,",
    "smallness of the deficiency @xmath5 can be used as a measure of replaceability of @xmath0 by some state in @xmath2 .",
    "an experiment is discussed in ref . where ghz class states are used for obtaining approximate w states .",
    "it will be shown that , if the set @xmath2 remains invariant under the stochastic reducibility relation of ref .  , then the function @xmath5 is also a monotone . in this case",
    "the distance @xmath7 and the monotone @xmath8 satisfy properties similar to those of the geometric measure of wei and goldbart . hence , there appears to be a number of different _ geometric measures _ ; the case for which @xmath2 is the set of product states gives just one of those measures .",
    "these measures also include previous generalizations@xcite , but the current generalization appears to exhaust all such pure - state measures that are based on the geometric distance to a set .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate these general geometric measures",
    ". it may be the case that some of these measures might be useful in the sense that they forbid some entanglement transformations allowed by all other known monotones .",
    "indeed , it appears that the distance to the w class states of three qubits is an example of this .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in section [ sec : definitionsandmonotonicity ] , the precise definition of the key property of the sets @xmath2 is presented and the monotonicity of @xmath5 is proven .",
    "section [ sec : bipartite ] contains the computation of all of the geometric measures for the bipartite entangled states .",
    "after that , the three qubit case is investigated and one of the monotones is shown to be a new monotone in section [ sec : threequbits ] . finally a brief summary is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the following , @xmath9-partite entangled pure states between @xmath9 distant particles will be considered . throughout this article",
    "we will be interested in pure states only .",
    "let us briefly recall the following definitions .",
    "the entangled state @xmath10 is said to be _ stochastically reducible _ to @xmath11 , if , after starting with the initial state @xmath10 , it is possible to obtain @xmath11 with non - zero probability by locc operations@xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the existence of local operators @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for some normalization constant @xmath14 .",
    "we say that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are _ slocc equivalent _ if they are stochastically reducible to each other .",
    "that statement is equivalent to the existence of invertible local operators @xmath12 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : stochastic_reducibilty ] ) is satisfied @xcite .",
    "the equivalence classes obtained from this equivalence relation are called slocc classes . if @xmath10 is stochastically reducible to @xmath11 , then all states in the slocc class of @xmath10 is stochastically reducible to any state in the class of @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "stochastic reducibility is also a relation between slocc classes .",
    "let @xmath2 be a set of states .",
    "if for any state @xmath10 in @xmath2 , all states @xmath11 that are stochastically reducible from @xmath10 are in @xmath2 , then we will say that @xmath2 is a _ stochastically invariant _ ( si ) or _ slocc invariant _ set .",
    "obviously , if @xmath10 is in the si set @xmath2 , then the whole of the slocc class of @xmath10 is a subset of @xmath2 .",
    "this means that si sets are unions of slocc classes .",
    "moreover , if @xmath2 contains a particular slocc class , then all classes that are stochastically reducible from this class are also contained in @xmath2 . in particular , this implies that @xmath2 contains ( the class of ) all product states .",
    "the central result of this article is the following theorem .",
    "if @xmath2 is a si set of normalized states , then the function @xmath5 of the normalized states @xmath0 is an entanglement monotone .",
    "the requirements that @xmath2 contain only normalized states and @xmath0 is normalized are imposed for utilizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_defined ] ) as a definition of @xmath8 . before proving this theorem",
    ", we need the following lemma .",
    "[ firstlemma ] let @xmath15 be vectors in a hilbert space .",
    "then , the operator inequality @xmath16 is satisfied if and only if there exists numbers @xmath17 such that @xmath18    _ proof : _ we first show the necessity .",
    "suppose that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lemma_statement1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "then , @xmath19 is positive semidefinite .",
    "let @xmath20 be the number of non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath21 . by using the spectral decomposition of @xmath21",
    ", we can find @xmath20 vectors @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "hence , we have the following relation @xmath24 then , by the schrdinger - ghjw theorem@xcite , there is a @xmath25 unitary matrix @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 ) , such that @xmath28 hence , we take @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 therefore , ( [ eq : lemma_statement2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "now , for proving the sufficiency part , suppose that ( [ eq : lemma_statement2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath31 be any arbitrary vector .",
    "then , @xmath32 here , schwarz inequality is used in passing from ( [ eq : schwarz1 ] ) to ( [ eq : schwarz2 ] ) .",
    "since the last inequality is valid for all vectors @xmath31 , then the associated inequality for operators , i.e. , ( [ eq : lemma_statement1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this completes the proof of the equivalence of ( [ eq : lemma_statement1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lemma_statement2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath33    now , we can start with the proof of the theorem .",
    "it should be shown that , if by locc , @xmath0 is transformed to states @xmath34 with probability @xmath35 , then @xmath36 for this purpose , it is enough to prove this inequality for the local operations carried out by a single party only .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , it will be assumed that the first party is carrying out a measurement .",
    "let @xmath37 be the local measurement operators associated with this operation .",
    "they satisfy @xmath38 where @xmath39 is used for denoting the identity operator acting on the state space of the @xmath40th party s particle .",
    "hence , we have @xmath41 let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be the appropriate unitary operators satisfying @xmath44 , whose existence is guaranteed by the polar decomposition of operators .",
    "for simplifying the notation , boldface letters will be used for denoting the 1st particle s local operators as an operator acting on the whole state space , i.e. , @xmath45 etc .",
    "let @xmath10 be an arbitrary vector in @xmath2 ; it will be used in the maximization of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_defined ] ) .",
    "let @xmath46 and note that these are non - negative numbers having the sum @xmath47 .",
    "let us define the vectors @xmath48 in @xmath2 as @xmath49 note that each vector @xmath48 is normalized and stochastically reducible from @xmath10",
    ". therefore all of them are in @xmath2 . for the case",
    "@xmath50 , the value of @xmath48 is unimportant ; it has just been assigned to a vector known to exist in @xmath2 .",
    "first note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "hence , by applying the lemma , we see that @xmath53 holds as an operator inequality .",
    "if the expectation value in the state @xmath0 is taken , we get @xmath54 where @xmath55 , which are also in @xmath2 . using the obvious fact that a particular value of a function is smaller than its maximum , i.e. , @xmath56",
    ", we get @xmath57 if the left - hand side is maximized over @xmath10 , then the inequality ( [ eq : monotone_ineq ] ) is obtained .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath2 contains product states and hence @xmath58 vanishes if @xmath0 is a product state .",
    "this completes the proof of the monotonicity of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath33    let us make a few remarks on the dependence of the measure @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_defined ] ) on the set @xmath2 .",
    "it can be readily observed that for any arbitrary set @xmath2 , the topological closure @xmath59 yields the same measure , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "in addition to this , two different sets yield the same measure @xmath8 ( and therefore the same distance @xmath7 ) if and only if they have the same closure . keeping this in mind",
    ", the converse of theorem 1 also holds as follows : if @xmath5 is an entanglement monotone , then the closure @xmath59 is a si set .",
    "this can be shown easily using the following observation : a state @xmath0 is in the closure @xmath59 if and only if @xmath58 .",
    "hence , if @xmath5 is a monotone and @xmath0 is a state in @xmath59 , then by the non - negativity and monotonicity of the measure , @xmath61 for all states @xmath62 that are stochastically reducible from @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that all such @xmath62 are also in @xmath59 and hence @xmath59 is si . in conclusion ,",
    "si sets are the most general sets that can be used in the definition ( [ eq : e_defined ] ) in order to make @xmath8 a monotone .",
    "let us also make a few remarks on si sets .",
    "note that the union of two si sets is also si .",
    "moreover , if @xmath63 and @xmath64 are si , then the monotone associated with the union @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 this basically follows from the fact that the optimum state in @xmath67 which is closest to @xmath0 [ i.e. , the state that optimizes eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d_defined ] ) and ( [ eq : e_defined ] ) ] is equal to one of the corresponding optimum states in @xmath68 and @xmath69 . because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_for_union ] ) , @xmath70 is less useful in applications since any entanglement transformation allowed by the monotones of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is also allowed by the monotone of their union .",
    "hence , when computing geometric distances , it is sufficient to consider only `` minimal '' si sets , which are sets that can not be expressed as the union of two si sets that do not contain each other .",
    "there is a one - to - one relation between these minimal si sets and the slocc classes .",
    "a minimal si set essentially contains one slocc - class @xmath71 at the top and includes only the classes that can be stochastically reduced from @xmath71 .",
    "note also that if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 the set of product states @xmath74 , is contained in all si sets , and therefore @xmath75 is the largest monotone among the monotones investigated here .",
    "for bipartite entanglement , only the schmidt rank of the states , i.e. , the number of terms in the schmidt decomposition , is sufficient for describing the slocc classes and si sets . for an integer @xmath76 ,",
    "the si set @xmath77 is composed of states having schmidt rank at most @xmath78 .",
    "hence , @xmath63 is the set of product states and we have the inclusion chain @xmath79 these are all possible si sets for the bipartite case .",
    "if @xmath0 has the schmidt rank @xmath78 , then only @xmath80 for @xmath81 are nonzero ; and @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath0 have the schmidt decomposition @xmath83 and let @xmath84 denote the schmidt coefficients arranged in decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "then , it will be shown below that @xmath86 for any @xmath87 .    in order to show eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_for_bipartite ] ) , the following inequality will be used .",
    "if @xmath88 and @xmath21 are arbitrary @xmath89 square matrices , then @xmath90 where @xmath91 represents the vector of singular values of the matrix @xmath88 ( i.e. , @xmath92 is the @xmath40th eigenvalue of @xmath93 ) and similarly for @xmath21 .",
    "this inequality can be deduced from the corresponding inequality for hermitian matrices : if @xmath94 and @xmath95 are @xmath89 _ hermitian _ matrices , then @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the vector of eigenvalues of @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively@xcite .",
    "the inequality ( [ ineq : with_singular ] ) can be proved easily by using ( [ ineq : with_eigenvalues ] ) as follows .",
    "let @xmath99\\quad,\\quad    b^\\prime=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & e^{i\\theta } b^\\dagger   \\\\ e^{-i\\theta}b & 0   \\end{array}\\right]\\quad.\\ ] ] note that @xmath94 is a hermitian matrix having eigenvalues @xmath100 ; similarly for the matrix @xmath95 .",
    "using the inequality ( [ ineq : with_eigenvalues ] ) we get @xmath101 choosing @xmath102 to be the phase angle of @xmath103 produces the desired inequality ( [ ineq : with_singular ] ) .",
    "now , consider any state @xmath10 having schmidt rank at most @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath10 is any state in the si set @xmath105 .",
    "such a state can be expressed as @xmath106 where @xmath88 is any @xmath89 matrix having matrix rank at most @xmath104 .",
    "hence , @xmath107 where @xmath108 represents the diagonal matrix formed from the schmidt coefficients of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath109 .",
    "now , using the inequality ( [ ineq : with_singular ] ) we get @xmath110 where we have used the fact that @xmath88 has at most @xmath104 non - zero singular values and then invoked the schwarz inequality in the last step .",
    "this places an upper bound on the inner product @xmath111 for all @xmath10 in @xmath105 .",
    "this bound is tight and can be reached by the following state in @xmath105 , @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the state label that has the @xmath40th largest schmidt coefficient ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath80 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_for_bipartite ] ) .",
    "the locc transformation rules for bipartite pure states have been determined for both deterministic@xcite and probabilistic@xcite transformations .",
    "it should be noted that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of a given entanglement transformation are exactly the condition that all of the geometric distance monotones are non - decreasing . in other words ,",
    "an initial state @xmath0 can be converted into the final states @xmath34 with respective probabilities @xmath35 , if and only if @xmath115 hence , locc transformation rules for the bipartite states can be expressed in terms of monotones which have a simple geometric meaning .",
    "note that a similar , but different , projection - operator based expression has been given for these monotones by barnum and linden@xcite .",
    "the simplest multipartite configuration is the three qubits which has been extensively investigated .",
    "there are six slocc classes for three qubits : the multipartite classes ghz and w ; the classes for bipartite entanglement a - bc , ab - c , c - ab ; and the completely separable states a - b - c where a , b and c denote local parties@xcite .",
    "the stochastic reducibility relation between these classes are as follows : any bipartite entangled state can be obtained by slocc operations either from ghz class or w class and a product state can be obtained from all the other classes .",
    "this hierarchy allows us to construct ten non - trivial si sets .",
    "six of those are minimal , containing a top slocc class and all the other classes that can be obtained from it . hence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si ] @xmath116 and similarly for the other classes .",
    "there are four non - trivial unions of any two or all three of @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which are non - minimal si sets ; but these are not worth investigating for discovering new useful monotones .    among the minimal si sets , the product states",
    "@xmath120 produce the original geometric distance that has been investigated before .",
    "the si sets generated by bipartite entangled states , i.e. , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , give rise to monotones that can be computed analytically by the expression derived in section [ sec : bipartite ] .",
    "the si set @xmath121 is dense in the complete set of states . in other words ,",
    "all states outside @xmath121 , namely the states in the w class , are the limit of some sequence of states in @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , the generic w - class state @xmath122 is the limit of @xmath123 as @xmath124 tends to zero , where @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "for this reason , the geometric distance and the associated monotone for this si set is identically zero , i.e. , @xmath127 for all @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the si set @xmath128 generated by the w class gives rise to a new monotone .",
    "this monotone is non - zero only for states in the ghz class .",
    "it may appear that @xmath129 is similar to the three - tangle@xcite , which is also zero on @xmath128 and non - zero only for the ghz states .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath129 and the three - tangle are independently useful as it will be argued below .",
    "first , note that if @xmath130 are entanglement monotones and @xmath131 is a concave function which is increasing in each argument @xmath132 , then @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 is also a monotone@xcite . in this case , we will say that the new monotone @xmath133 can be generated from @xmath135 . for applications",
    ", @xmath133 has no use whatsoever ( if all @xmath136 can be computed ) since any entanglement transformation allowed by all @xmath136 is also allowed by @xmath133 .",
    "it might be of interest to investigate which of the known monotones can be generated from the others . by using only a few numerical evidences",
    ", it is possible to show that a given set of monotones can not be generated from each other .",
    "this can be done either by finding an example against the increasing property or an example against the concavity property of the function @xmath137 .    for the current case of three qubits , there are five nontrivial monotones based on the geometric distance , namely @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath129 , and another monotone , the three - tangle @xmath142 .",
    "it can be shown that none of these are generated from the others .",
    "numerical calculations carried out indicate that for any of these six functions , it is possible to find a pair of states where the transformation between them is allowed by the other five functions while forbidden by the selected function .",
    "this means that all of these monotones are independently useful in analyzing entanglement transformations .",
    "the following is a simple example that shows that @xmath129 can not be generated from the other geometric measures and the three tangle .",
    "let @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath14 is the normalization factor .",
    "the function @xmath145 indicates a transformation ordering different than those of the tangle and the other monotones as shown in table [ table : one ] .",
    "this shows that @xmath145 is a new entanglement monotone .",
    ".the values of the selected entanglement measures for two states that can not be converted into each other .",
    "the geometric monotones are computed numerically by an iterative algorithm that converge to local extrema .",
    "algorithm is repeated for several initial random configuration for finding the global extremum .",
    "this example shows that the monotonicity of @xmath129 does not follow from the other measures shown in the table . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another point that must be mentioned is , in contrast with the bipartite case , the insufficiency of the geometric measures alone for deciding the possibility of a given entanglement transformation . as an example consider the following state in ghz class , @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath17 are real with @xmath148 and @xmath149 is a complex number .",
    "it is obvious that the states @xmath150 and @xmath151 , where @xmath152 represents the complex conjugate , have the same values for the three - tangle and all geometric monotones . in a recent study@xcite ,",
    "the rules for deterministic entanglement transformations between multipartite states with tensor rank 2 have been established .",
    "according to these rules , when none of @xmath17 are zero and @xmath149 is neither real nor on the unit circle , then these two states can not be converted into each other .",
    "moreover , if it is possible to transform @xmath150 to some ghz state @xmath0 , then it is not possible to convert @xmath151 into @xmath0 .",
    "this example clearly shows that the geometric monotones and the three tangle are not sufficient for deciding on the possibility of transformations .",
    "hence , there must be another monotone that is not derivable from all of these , which changes value under the complex conjugation of the @xmath149 parameter .",
    "in this article , a more general approach is taken to the geometric measure of entanglement in pure states by replacing the set of product states with a set which is invariant under stochastic reducibility relation . in this way , a number of new entanglement monotones can be obtained .",
    "moreover , it is argued that these measures exhaust all pure - state monotones whose definition are based on the geometric distance to a set , since the closure of such sets must be si .",
    "consequently , these monotones contain previous generalizations@xcite of the geometric measure .",
    "these measures quantify not only the amount , but also the flavor of entanglement where by flavor we mean the type of entanglement associated with each slocc class .",
    "the original geometric measure @xmath75 , where @xmath74 is the set of product states , quantifies the property of being entangled , meaning that the state @xmath0 is unentangled if and only if this measure vanishes .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath5 for non - product si sets @xmath2 essentially quantifies the difference of the flavor of entanglement in @xmath0 from the flavor associated with @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , an @xmath2 based characterization of entanglement is obtained .",
    "we have @xmath58 if and only if either @xmath0 has an identical flavor with the states in @xmath2 or otherwise it can be well approximated with those states with desirably high fidelity ."
