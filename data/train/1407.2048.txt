    "@xcite report the results of fuv and optical observations of the sgs , providing an independent measure of the ages , masses and total mechanical energy deposited by the central stellar association and by the clusters in giant h  ii  regions on the rim of the sgs based on the fuv , b - band , and h@xmath0  fluxes ( see table  2 in their paper ) .",
    "@xcite analysed chandra x - ray observations of the sgs .",
    "the authors performed a multi - wavelength ( _ galex _ and _ spitzer _ ) analysis of the stellar population in the sgs area and identified four star forming regions - young star clusters inside and at the edges of the sgs ( c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 in their table  1 and fig .",
    "2 ) ; c2 coincides with the central star forming region studied by @xcite .",
    "their positions are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hii - regs ] by the large green circles .",
    "these largest clusters include the small stellar groups from @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hii - regs ] .",
    "the above authors determined the mass , age , and mechanical energy produced by massive stars and supernovae in these four massive star clusters .",
    "they estimate the rate of mechanical energy input from the x - ray fluxes in accordance with the best - fitting starburst99 model .",
    "when comparing our study of h  ii  regions with the analysis of their stellar populations one must bear in mind the uncertainty of our velocity estimates on the one hand and the fact that the reported parameters of star clusters are model dependent on the other hand .",
    "the uncertainty of our estimates is due primarily to the non - uniform density of neutral gas in the walls of the sgs and the irregular morphology and kinematics of h  ii  complexes .",
    "however , table  [ tab : hii_params ] shows that the mechanical energy input rate for the overwhelming majority of the complexes of triggered star formation associated with the sgs is sufficient to drive the formation of expanding shell - like h  ii  regions .",
    "the only exceptions are regions #  7 and #  8 .    the fact that our inferred energy input rate required to drive the formation of region #  8 significantly exceeds the energy input rate estimated by @xcite is quite understandable .",
    "we significantly increased the size of this h  ii  region ( and consequently the required energy ) by incorporating into it the faint extended arc - shaped nebula that adjoins the snr from the west , i.e. , by combining two faint nebulae into a single shell - like structure .",

    "the situation with region #  7 is very interesting .",
    "we estimate @xmath121 and the corresponding @xmath122  myr ( it is the youngest of the complexes discussed here ) . the high expansion velocity estimated in this study is indicative of a shock effect . to verify this hypothesis",

    "[ fig : reg7-ls ] , the ratio i([s",
    "ii])/i(h@xmath0 )  @xmath123 in the central bright nebula corresponds to the recombination radiation of the h  ii  region , but at the same time it increases outwards and reaches i([s  ii])/i(h@xmath0 )  @xmath124 at the edges of the ring nebula , which suggests a possible shock wave effect .",
    "the required kinetic energy input rate of @xmath125 determined above can be provided by winds from several wr or of stars .",
    "note that the ring nebula is observed not inside the h  i  cloud , but against a background of tenuous diffuse gas .",
    "this suggests that the ambient density of unperturbed gas calculated in both methods is highly overestimated .",
    "given the uncertainty of the estimated @xmath12 in the neighbourhood of region #  7 , even a single star with a strong wind would be enough .",
    "the search for wr stars conducted by @xcite produced no possible candidates in this region .",
    "we nevertheless consider it very interesting to perform a detailed analysis of the stellar content of the pi 01b cluster at the centre of the ring nebula .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the large ring in region #  7 may be an old snr .",
    "at least , with the ambient density of @xmath126 the ring nebula fits well the empirical evolutionary sequence of snrs on the @xmath127 versus @xmath128 plot suggested by @xcite .",
    "the expected radio surface brightness of an snr 210  pc in diameter is about @xmath129 ( see the @xmath130 relation in @xcite ) .",

    "these are typical parameters for the sgs region .",
    "however , there are several faint regions observed with kinematic evidence of local perturbations or a presence of an expanding shell ( see , e.g. , profile diff-1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - prof ] ) .",
    "the line profile of the central region #  1 shows a well - defined two - component structure corresponding to the expansion of very faint diffuse structures at a velocity of @xmath139 .",
    "the kinematic age of the central cluster in region #  1 , which is responsible for the formation of the sgs , is equal to 14  myr @xcite .",
    "therefore the bright h  ii  nebula is not observed at this location ( h@xmath0  arises from the recombination of gas ionized by the radiation of massive stars and is observed over their typical lifetimes @xmath7 myr ) .",
    "however , one can still see the effect of shocks from stellar winds and sn explosions originating from the central stellar complex in region #  1 .",
    "@xcite revealed a bright point - like source cxou j102843.0 + 682816 in the sgs in the @xmath119  kev band and detected an excess of diffuse low surface brightness x - ray emission within and around the h  i  hole after removing the point source from the image ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "according to @xcite , superbubbles can retain a large fraction ( up to @xmath140 for @xmath141 ) of the initial energy obtained from sn explosions as bubble thermal energy and kinetic energy of the shell .",
    "this reserve of mechanical energy powers the observed diffuse x - ray emission of the hot gas that fills the central hole , drives the expansion of the neutral sgs at a velocity of @xmath142 , and may also be responsible for the observed expansion of the faint ionized gas structures inside the sgs at a velocity of @xmath143 .",
    "the observed parameters of local diffuse gas in the sgs region are similar to those of the extra - planar diffuse ionized medium ( dig ) in spiral and irr galaxies .",
    "the observed i([s  ii])/i(h@xmath0 )  and i([n  ii])/i(h@xmath0 )  line ratios in the dig are higher than those in the classical h  ii  regions .",
    "the ionization of dig is traditionally explained by the leakage of ionizing photons from the h  ii  regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "to explain the increase of i([n  ii])/i(h@xmath0 ) , i([s  ii])/i(h@xmath0 )  and i([o  iii]5007)/i(h@xmath144 )  with galactic height , additional sources of ionization were considered : ionization by shocks or turbulent mixing layers may be responsible for some of the dig emission .",
    "note that the photoionization simulations of a multi - component interstellar medium by @xcite do not require as much additional heating as the previous studies .",
    "we can similarly explain the faint diffuse ionized gas emission observed in the sgs as a result of leakage from the bright h  ii  regions of both the ionizing photons and mechanical energy of stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "all the h  ii  complexes studied here indeed have a non - uniform , clumpy , or filamentary structure , which allows the radiation and shocks to leak outside through low - density regions . in a number of cases the results of such a leakage are actually observed .",
    "one striking example are the ` horns ' : two faint emission structures observed beyond the northern boundary of region #  6 around a dense h  i  cloud ( see fig .  [ fig : diffgas ] ) .",
    "these structures are observed both in the h@xmath0  and [ s  ii ]  lines .",
    "the sgs in ic  2574 is one of the most dynamically active h  i  structures among irr galaxies , because we observe it during a period of violent star formation in its walls triggered by the expansion of the sgs .",
    "what future awaits this structure ?",
    "the most dynamically active shell - like h  ii  complexes exhibiting the expansion effect are regions #  4 , 6 and 7 , which are located in the northern wall of the sgs .",
    "the expansion of region #  6 rapidly disperses the local h  i  gas in the northern wall of the sgs .",
    "this is , in particular , clearly demonstrated by the emission features mentioned above ",
    "the ` horns ' located beyond the northern boundary of region #  6 ( see fig  [ fig : diffgas ] ) .",
    "the destruction of the northern wall of the h  i  supergiant shell due to h  ii  complexes will result in the growth of the sgs and , ultimately , in its merging with the neighbouring h  i structures .",
    "one must primarily expect the sgs to merge with the supergiant h  i  shells #  31 in the west and #  37 in the north ( see figs . 9 and 14 in * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , after several billion years there will be a system of giant adjoining and/or interacting shell - like h  i structures similar to those observed in the irr galaxy holmberg  ii ( see * ? ? ?",
    "1 .   to study the kinematics of ionized gas in the regions of triggered star formation in the walls of the sgs , we performed observations with the sao ras 6-m telescope using scorpio and scorpio-2 multi - mode focal reducers operated in the scanning fabry  perot interferometer , long - slit and direct imaging modes",
    ". 2 .   using the things survey data to analyse the kinematics of neutral gas",
    ", we ` derotated ' both ( 21 cm and h@xmath0 ) data cubes with a circular rotation model of ic  2574 constructed by fitting the h  i  velocity field .",
    "3 .   the consideration of global h  i  kinematics confirms the sgs expansion velocity obtained earlier by @xcite . a more detailed analysis of the h  i  kinematics revealed the non - uniform structure and kinematics of the sgs ; it is shown to be located at the far side of the galactic disc plane .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the kinematics of all extended h  ii  complexes in the sgs .",
    "we estimated the expansion velocities for four regions , which allowed us to determine their kinematic ages and the kinetic energy input rate required to drive their formation . for the remaining h@xmath0  complexes we estimated the upper limit of the expansion velocity and the corresponding limiting age and kinetic energy input .",
    "a comparison with the age and energy input from the stellar population of the complexes based on the data of @xcite and @xcite shows that the energy input is sufficient in all complexes except for region #  7 .",
    "we discuss in detail the nature of region #  7 , which is a regular faint thin ring with a bright inner region in its southern part .",
    "the obtained expansion velocity of @xmath145 shows that region #  7 is the youngest h@xmath0  complex in the sgs ( @xmath146  myr ) .",
    "the high expansion velocity is indicative of a shock .",
    "the significant role of shock waves in the gas ionization process is evident from the analysis of the i([s  ii])/i(h@xmath0 ) line ratio .",
    "region #  11 was considered as a possible snr based on radio observations @xcite .",
    "we measured its expansion velosity and estimate the age of the snr and the initial sn explosion energy @xmath147 under two assumptions : the adiabatic stage or intense radiative cooling . in both cases",
    "the results confirm that region #  11 is an old remnant of a standard sn .",
    "therefore the inferred high expansion velocity and the high relative [ s  ii ]  line intensities provide further evidence that region #  11 is indeed an snr .",
    "our observations reveal a faint diffuse component of ionized gas in the sgs area , which did not show up previously in _",
    "hst_/acs images . in the central region",
    "#  1 , as well as outside the sgs , we observe h@xmath0  and [ s  ii ]  line emission with an average surface brightness of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the i([s  ii])/i(h@xmath0 )  intensity ratio is higher both in the border regions outside the sgs and in the outer layers of region #  1 .",
    "the observed parameters of local diffuse gas in the sgs region are similar to those of extra - planar diffuse ionized medium in sp and irr galaxies .",
    "an analysis of the kinematics of this faint diffuse emission shows a single - component line profile in the outer regions of the sgs , but reveals some structures that show perturbed kinematics with a multi - component h@xmath0  line profile .",
    "the central region #  1 shows well - defined two - component line profiles corresponding to the expansion of faint diffuse inner structures with a velocity of @xmath148 .",
    "this expansion velocity and the soft x - ray diffuse emission within the h  i  hole ( and extending slightly beyond it ) are extant traces of the initial effect of shock waves from stellar winds and sn explosions in the central stellar complex of region #  1 .",
    "8 .   based on the results of the sgs gas kinematics analysis we made speculative conclusions about the future of this structure :",
