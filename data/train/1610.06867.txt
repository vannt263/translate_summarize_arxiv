    "recent experimental advances in ultracold atomic gases have provided novel ways to examine the static properties and the non - equilibrium dynamics of correlated many - body systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "optical lattice potentials are a prominent feature of ultracold experiments , as they allow for the study of the correlated tunneling dynamics and its dependence on the interparticle interaction @xcite .",
    "systems consisting of small ensembles of atoms offer the opportunity , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite to identify and track microscopic ( quantum ) mechanisms due to their finite size and the absence of finite temperature effects . on the other hand , quantum quenches @xcite",
    "enable us to study the dependence of the dynamical response on the perturbation amplitude applied to an equilibrium system . therefore , quenched finite systems in combination with the appropriate lattice geometries can lead to new quantum effects , especially when the translational invariance of the lattice is broken .    a well - studied model that breaks the translational invariance consists of a lattice potential with an imposed harmonic trap @xcite . concerning the dynamics , the ballistic expansion rate of a bosonic mott - insulator trapped in such a composite trap after a quench of the trap frequency to a lower value has been shown to depend on the interparticle interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been demonstrated @xcite that in the limit of low filling factors the dynamics is equivalent to harmonically trapped bosons with a lattice - dependent effective mass .",
    "both of the above - mentioned effects emerge when the harmonic confinement is relatively weak compared to the interparticle repulsion .",
    "however , a so far largely unexplored theme is the competition between the harmonic confinement and the interaction strength , which favors different spatial configurations",
    ". an intriguing question would thereby be whether this competition can be exploited to obtain a high level of controllability of such a system and , as a consequence whether the out - of - equilibrium dynamics can be utilized to achieve specific state preparations .    in the present work we consider a small ensemble of bosons confined in an optical lattice subjected to an additional strong harmonic confinement and",

    "we first analyze the many - body eigenspectrum for varying trap frequency , revealing the existence of narrow and wide avoided crossings between the many - body eigenstates .",
    "the dynamics of the interacting bosons shows distinct regions of weak and strong dynamical response . in particular",

    "in the present section we shall briefly discuss our theoretical framework .",
    "first , we introduce the many - body hamiltonian ( see [ sec : hamilt ] ) of our system .",
    "then , the wavefunction representation in terms of a time - independent number state basis ( [ subsec : ns_con ] ) is outlined . finally , the basic observables ( [ sec : rel_quantities ] ) used for the interpretation of the dynamics are explained .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian of @xmath0 bosons trapped in a one - dimensional lattice potential with an imposed harmonic trap reads    h=&_i=1^n ( - + v_0 ^2 ( k x_i ) + x_i^2 ) + & + g _ i=1^n _",
    "j = i+1^n ( x_i - x_j ) , [ hamil ]    where @xmath1 denotes the position of the @xmath2-th particle .",
    "the optical lattice potential is characterized by its depth @xmath3 and the corresponding wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "the imposed harmonic trap ( parallel to lattice axis ) depends on its frequency @xmath5 and confines the particles around the origin @xmath6",
    ". the effective @xmath7 coupling strength of the contact interaction @xmath8 @xcite can be manipulated via the transverse harmonic oscillator length @xmath9 ( belonging to the strongly confined dimensions ) @xcite or by the @xmath10 @xmath11-wave scattering length @xmath12 via a feshbach resonance @xcite .    to stimulate the dynamics we utilize the following scheme : the system is initially prepared in the ground state of the many - body hamiltonian ( see eq.[hamil ] ) .",
    "then , at @xmath13 we instantaneously change the trap frequency @xmath5 to a lower value and let the system evolve under the new hamiltonian .    throughout this work",
    "we shall employ the recoil energy @xmath14 , the inverse wavevector @xmath15 and the bosonic mass @xmath16 as the units of the energy , length and mass , respectively .",
    "hard wall boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the number of lattice sites .",
    "the depth of the lattice is fixed to @xmath19 , thus including three localized single particle states .",
    "we expand the exact state , @xmath20 , in a number state basis of single particle states localized on each lattice site .",
    "these localized states are constructed using the subset of delocalized eigenstates with @xmath21 nodes for each lattice site , i.e. @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in the absence of a harmonic confinement this subset of eigenstates belong to the @xmath21-th bloch band of the system . to obtain a set of localized states we diagonalize the band - projected position operator @xmath24 , where the operator @xmath25 projects onto the band @xmath21 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the eigenstates @xmath26 , @xmath27 of @xmath28 as the single - band wannier states of the deformed lattice .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-body number state basis reads        where the operator @xmath29 performs the @xmath2-th permutation of @xmath0 elements and @xmath30 refers to the number occupation of the wannier state @xmath31 . to simplify the notation we shall make the following assumptions .",
    "we omit the superscript if no wannier state or only the wannier states belonging to the @xmath32-th band are occupied , and decompose the occupation number as @xmath33 if more than a single wannier state localized in a certain well is occupied .",
    "for instance , @xmath34 refers to the four - particle state of the triple - well where the ground states of the left and the middle well , the first excited state of the middle well , as well as the second excited state of the right well are each occupied by one boson . for later convenience we also denote by @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) the parity symmetric ( antisymmetric ) combination of the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    in the presence of a harmonic confinement ,",
    "the wannier number states are not uniquely ordered with respect to their energy expectation value , as argued in the following .",
    "indeed , let us consider a system of four bosons in a triple - well . for strong harmonic confinement and @xmath39",
    "there are five number state subsets : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ordered in increasing energy . on the other hand , for an interacting gas with vanishing harmonic confinement there are four subsets of number states energetically ordered by the multiplicity of bosons that reside in each well : single pairs @xmath45 , double pairs @xmath46 , triplets @xmath47 and quadruplets @xmath48 , where @xmath49 stands for site permutations .",
    "note that , for interaction energies of the order of the band gap , also higher band excitations must be considered .    from the above example",
    "it becomes evident that a reordering of the number states in energy takes place as the system passes from the one limiting case to the other .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath50 belonging to the classes @xmath51 and @xmath52 , is the most favorable state for strong confinement but , at the same time , the most unfavorable for strong interactions .",
    "as we shall see , this corresponding reordering process is the main reason for the resonant dynamics in the quenched system .",
    "let us now briefly introduce a few basic observables to be utilized in the following analysis , which are based on the one - body density @xmath53 . to quantify the time - evolution of inter- and intrawell modes we use the average position of the bosons in a spatial region @xmath54 , @xmath55 x _",

    "the position variance over the whole lattice @xmath57 quantifies a global breathing mode , composed of intersite tunneling and intrasite breathing and dipole modes , which contribute altogether to the total contraction and expansion of the atomic cloud .",
    "@xmath57 thus offers a measure for the net dynamical response of the system .    to measure the impact of the quench",
    "we also define the time - averaged position variance    - _ x , l^2(0 ) & ^t_0 dt  _ x , l^2(t ) -_x , l^2(0 ) + & _ i >",
    "j ( c_i^ *   _ g_i | ( x - x ) ^2 | _ j _ g   c_j ) ,    which describes how far the system is in average from its initial state . here",
    "@xmath58 is the @xmath2-th excited stationary eigenstate and @xmath59 holds .",

    "c_j |^2 ,    [ var_var ] quantifies how much the state fluctuates around its average configuration during the evolution .",
    "@xmath60 thus measures the intensity of the dynamical processes and of defect formations following a quench .",
    "the theoretical limit @xmath61 is replaced in practice by a finite evolution time @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath60 have converged .",
    "as a prototype system exhibiting characteristic quench induced dynamics , we use a system of four harmonically trapped bosons in a triple well potential .",
    "we first investigate the eigenspectra of the system with varying trap frequency ( section [ subsec : gs_con ] ) , which are subsequently related to the dynamics induced by the quench ( section [ sec : quench_dynamics ] ) .",

    "we focus on the even - parity part of the spectrum @xmath76 ( see fig . [ fig:3w_frg](@xmath66 ) ) , which contains the ground state @xmath78 . at @xmath74",
    "the number states within each class ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) are very close in energy , their minor energetical difference being caused by the respective avoided crossings ( and the boundary conditions of the triple well ) , and thus the eigenstates are a superposition of the corresponding wannier number states",
    ". in particular , each of the eigenstates possesses a dominant contribution from a particular wannier number state of class @xmath79 ( presented on the left hand side of fig . [ fig:3w_frg](@xmath66 ) ) . for @xmath81 , the eigenenergies increase linearly ( proportional to the number of bosons in the side wells ) with @xmath82 .",
    "the population of the dominant contribution of each eigenstate increases with @xmath82 ( at the expense of the contribution of other number states which belong to the same class ) up to the point of complete dominance and therefore saturation .",
    "this behaviour with increasing @xmath82 occurs unless we encounter an avoided crossing with another eigenstate . indeed , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3w_frg](@xmath66 ) at such avoided crossings ( being denoted by @xmath83 , @xmath73 ) the two involved eigenstates exchange their character and therefore corresponding dominant wannier number states .",

    "moreover , the avoided crossings @xmath85 and @xmath86 due to their proximity exhibit a slightly different behaviour being referred to in the following as a composite avoided crossing @xmath87 .",

    "the hubbard parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 refer to the inter - site hopping , intra - site interaction , site offset energy and the zero point energy of the ensemble , respectively .",

[ fig:3w_frg](@xmath66 ) ) is much narrower . on the other hand ,",
    "the composite avoided crossing @xmath113 can be interpreted as follows : at @xmath114 a comparatively narrow avoided crossing between the eigenstates @xmath115 and @xmath116 takes place ( exchange between the wannier number states @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) . a wide avoided crossing involving the eigenstates @xmath115 and",

    "for larger interaction strength , the many - body states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3w_frg](@xmath21 ) , become energetically higher due to the higher interaction energy among the bosons .",

    "indeed , for @xmath131 the bhm can still be applied since : a ) there is no coupling to higher band excitations via hopping terms of the form @xmath132 due to the orthogonality of the single - particle bloch states that belong to different bands , and b ) in the interaction part of the hamiltonian , intra - band on - site interaction terms due to @xmath133 , where @xmath134 , @xmath135 vanish because of parity symmetry within the corresponding well @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in fig .",
    "[ fig:3w_frg](@xmath21 ) by the absence of avoided crossings between states with higher band excitations ( @xmath136-st excited band ) and states with all particles in the @xmath32-th band ( see for instance the very narrow avoided crossing at @xmath137 involving the states @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) .",
