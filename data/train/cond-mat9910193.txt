    "charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions , composed of charged macroions ( @xmath0 nm in diameter ) and microions ( counterions and salt ions ) suspended by brownian motion in a molecular fluid , occur in a variety of natural and engineered forms  @xcite .",
    "common examples include clay minerals , paints , inks , and detergents ( micellar solutions ) , in which repulsive electrostatic interactions promote stability against coagulation induced by van der waals attractive forces . somewhat more exotic are suspensions of synthetic latex or silica spheres whose near monodispersity facilitates self - assembly into crystalline lattices  @xcite . aside from serving as well - characterized models for fundamental study , synthetic colloids exhibit unique optical properties that underly several emerging technological applications , such as nanosecond optical switches  @xcite and photonic band gap materials  @xcite",
    ".    accurate prediction of the physical properties of colloidal matter relies on a fundamental understanding of interparticle interactions .",
    "the first quantitative account of electrostatic interactions was achieved by derjaguin , landau , verwey , and overbeek ( dlvo )  @xcite .",
    "based on the poisson - boltzmann equation for the electrostatic potential  @xcite , the dlvo theory portrays the bare coulomb interactions between macroions as effectively screened by a surrounding atmosphere of microions .",
    "the resulting screened - coulomb pair potential has been a valuable cornerstone of colloid science for half a century .",
    "nevertheless , experimental evidence for apparent long - range attractions between macroions  @xcite has contributed to renewed interest in colloidal interparticle interactions .",
    "an explicit description of the multi - component mixture of macroions , counterions , salt ions , and solvent molecules clearly poses a formidable challenge .",
    "consequently , interactions in such complex systems are usually treated at the level of _ effective _ interactions .",
    "tracing out from the partition function statistical degrees of freedom of all but a single component reduces the problem to that of an equivalent one - component system of  pseudo - particles \" governed by an effective thermodynamic - state - dependent interaction  @xcite .",
    "a range of theoretical and numerical methods have been developed to investigate effective interactions in charge - stabilized colloids .",
    "strategies deployed to date include poisson - boltzmann cell models  @xcite , monte carlo simulation  @xcite , _ ab initio _ simulation  @xcite , and density - functional theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , silbert and coworkers  @xcite proposed an approach motivated by analogies between charged colloids and metals . with the correspondences ( counterion @xmath1 electron ) and ( macroion @xmath1 metallic ion )",
    ", the procedure is closely akin to the pseudopotential theory of metals  @xcite , which can successfully account for thermodynamic properties of simple metals  @xcite . performing a classical trace over microion degrees of freedom and describing the electrostatic response of the microions to the macroions within second - order perturbation theory , results in an effective interaction between pseudo - macroions _ and _ an associated volume energy that contributes to the total free energy .",
    "the importance of including the volume energy in calculating thermodynamic properties of charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions has been emphasized recently by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop further the response approach to charge - stabilized colloids , extending it , in particular , to suspensions of finite - sized macroions .",
    "the proposed extensions enforce exclusion of microions from the macroion hard cores and explicitly take into account the volume excluded by the macroions to the microions",
    ". a second goal of the paper is to establish a framework for generalizing the theory to include nonlinear response to allow investigation of effective _ many - body _ interactions . in the next section , following a brief review of the response approach , the extensions are outlined .",
    "section 3 presents the main results  obtained within a linear response approximation  for an effective pair potential acting between pseudo - macroions and an associated volume energy , both of which consistently incorporate excluded volume effects .",
    "finally in sec .  4 , we discuss implications of the results for thermodynamic properties of charge - stabilized colloids and prospects for generalizing the theory beyond linear response .",
    "the theory described below is based on the  primitive \" model , wherein for simplicity the solvent is treated as a uniform dielectric continuum . to simplify notation",
    ", it is furthermore assumed that counterions are the only microions present ( deionized suspension ) .",
    "the general case of finite salt concentration will be addressed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the model system then consists of @xmath2 charged hard - sphere macroions of diameter @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the elementary charge ) and @xmath6 point counterions of charge @xmath7 suspended in a uniform fluid medium characterized entirely by a dielectric constant @xmath8 . each macroion is assumed to carry a fixed charge , uniformly distributed over its surface .",
    "charge fluctuations are thus implicitly ignored in the model .",
    "described statistically by a canonical ensemble , the system occupies a fixed total volume @xmath9 at temperature @xmath10 . for a given number of macroions , global charge neutrality constrains the number of counterions by the condition @xmath11 .    denoting macroion and counterion positions by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ,",
    "the full hamiltonian of the system can be expressed in the form @xmath14 with the individual terms to be specified below . the first term on the right side of eq .",

    "( [ h ] ) is a counterion hamiltonian , taking the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the counterion kinetic energy , @xmath22 is the coulomb interaction between a pair of counterions , and @xmath23 is the hard - sphere interaction between a point counterion and a macroion core .",

    ", @xmath25 has the coulomb form . inside the core ,",
    "however , @xmath25 is not uniquely defined .",

    "@xmath25 to be a constant for @xmath26 and take @xmath27 where the parameter @xmath28 will be specified ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) to ensure that the counterion density vanishes within the core , as physically it must .",
    "having defined the hamiltonian , we now turn to a statistical mechanical description , with the ultimate aim of calculating the free energy of the system .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath29 the angular brackets symbolizing classical traces over macroion or counterion degrees of freedom .",
    "following standard treatments developed first in the context of simple metals  @xcite , we proceed by reducing the two - component mixture of macroions and counterions to an equivalent one - component system . the reduction is achieved by performing a restricted trace over counterion coordinates , while keeping the macroion coordinates fixed .",

    "the counterion free energy is a complicated many - body function of the macroion positions .",
    "progress can be made , however , by formally adding to and substracting from @xmath33 a term , @xmath34 , representing the energy of a uniform compensating negative background .",

    "the advantage of this manipulation is that @xmath39 is simply the hamiltonian of a classical one - component plasma ( ocp ) of counterions in the presence of _ neutral _ hard - sphere macroions .",
    "now the counterions , being excluded by the hard cores of the macroions , occupy the _ free _ volume @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the volume not occupied by the macroion cores .",
    "the average _ effective _ density of counterions is therefore given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the _ nominal _ counterion density and @xmath43 is the macroion volume fraction .",
    "an important question now arises .",
    "what volume should the background occupy ? in order that @xmath39 truly be the hamiltonian of an ocp ,",
    "the background and counterions clearly must occupy the same volume .",
    "in fact , were the background to occupy a different volume ( _ e.g. _ , the total volume @xmath9 ) then the effective hamiltonian would contain terms that are formally infinite ( see below ) , although identically cancelling , associated with the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "thus , the background is taken to be excluded  along with the counterions  from the macroion cores , its density equaling the effective counterion density @xmath44 .",
    "the background energy is then given explicitly by  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47 limit of the fourier transform of @xmath48 .",
    "the infinity arising from @xmath34 will be seen below to be formally cancelled by an identical infinity in @xmath49 .",
    "thus far , the theory is exact , within the primitive model .",
    "the challenge lies ahead in calculating the counterion free energy [ eq .",
    "( [ fc1 ] ) ] .",
    "one proposed approach  @xcite invokes density - functional theory to approximate @xmath35 , regarded as a functional of the counterion density , by expanding in a functional taylor series about a uniform counterion ocp .",
    "an alternative strategy  @xcite , inspired by the pseudopotential theory of metals , is to formally regard @xmath50 as an  external \" potential acting upon a counterion ocp and approximate @xmath35 by perturbation theory . following the latter strategy@xcite",

    "starting from the primitive model of charge - stabilized colloids , formally reducing the two - component macroion - counterion mixture to an equivalent one - component system of pseudo - macroions , and applying a linear response approximation to the counterion density , we have obtained expressions for both an effective electrostatic pair interaction [ eqs .",

    "it is important first to note that by associating the hard - sphere part of the total macroion - counterion interaction with the counterion hamiltonian [ eq .

    "determining the free energy of such a system in general poses a nontrivial task . in practice , however , counterion densities are usually low enough that the ocp may be assumed to be essentially uniform , except perhaps near contact with a macroion surface .",
    "now , for typical macroion charges and concentrations , the ocp is so weakly coupled ( unlike its electronic counterpart in metals ) that its free energy is dominated by the ideal - gas entropic component .",

    "the importance of redefining the usual @xmath91 in this way  a result that emerges naturally from the response approach  has been stressed also by russel and coworkers  @xcite .    in passing ,",
    "two remarks are in order .",

    "in contrast , setting @xmath25 to zero for @xmath101 would result in a nonvanishing counterion density inside the macroion cores . a distinction between the metallic and colloidal cases",
    "lies in the fact that , while counterions are strictly excluded from macroion cores , electrons may at least partially penetrate metallic ion cores .",

    "the only difference between our potential and the dlvo potential lies in the definition of @xmath91 [ eq .  ( [ kappa ] ) ] , which here involves the _ effective _ counterion density @xmath44 .",

    ", the corresponding term can not be ignored  @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out some limitations of the theory and the results presented above .",
    "first of all , the assumption of linear response of the counterions is strictly valid only for dilute suspensions of weakly charged macroions . whether the linear response approximation remains valid at higher concentrations  in particular , concentrations for which excluded volume effects begin to play a role  is an interesting and open question . in this regard",
    ", it may be worth noting that poisson - boltzmann cell model calculations  @xcite and _ ab initio _ simulations  @xcite do support the general form of the screened - coulomb pair potential at appreciable concentrations , albeit with renormalized dlvo parameters .",
    "secondly , by considering only electrostatic and hard steric interactions , and ignoring short - range interactions between counterions and macroion surfaces , the theory can not address the possibility of condensation of counterions onto the macroions and the consequences for effective macroion charges .",
    "finally , no account is taken of correlations between charge fluctuations , either on the macroion surfaces or in the density distributions of counterions surrounding neighbouring macroions .",
    "for spherical macroions , monte carlo simulations and cell model calculations  @xcite suggest that such correlations make only a small contribution to the total free energy , at least at low salt concentrations . on the other hand , for rod - like macroions , correlated charge fluctuations may play a more significant role  @xcite .    in summary , by applying a linear response approximation to the counterions surrounding charged monodisperse hard - sphere macroions in a colloidal suspension ,",
    "we have derived two main results , namely an effective electrostatic pair interaction @xmath114 [ eq .  ( [ veffr ] ) ] and an associated volume energy @xmath73 [ eq .  ( [ eo2 ] ) ] .",
    "the total free energy of the system is ultimately the sum of the volume energy ",
    "whose physical origins are the counterion entropy and the macroion - counterion interaction energy  and the free energy of the equivalent one - component system of pseudo - macroions interacting via their effective pair interaction .",
    "our expression for @xmath114 confirms that a linear response approximation , combined with the msa for the response function , yields the familiar dlvo form of pair potential for spherical macroions , prefactors included  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the dlvo potential also may be derived by linearizing the poisson - boltzmann equation .",
    "at the same time , however , our derivation indicates how excluded volume corrections may be incorporated through the density dependence of the inverse screening length @xmath91 , by substituting for the nominal counterion density @xmath115 the _ effective _ density @xmath44 of counterions occupying the free volume between macroion cores .",
    "our expression for the volume energy , which quantitatively exhibits the dependence on the macroion density , confirms the necessity of including @xmath73 in calculating thermodynamic properties from the free energy  @xcite . in particular , the phase behaviour of deionized suspensions of highly charged macroions have been shown to depend sensitively on the volume energy  @xcite .",
    "bulk pressure and elastic constants are expected to be similarly sensitive .",
    "furthermore , our expression for @xmath73 is consistent with that obtained by van roij _",
    "@xcite from an alternative density - functional approach .",
    "the sole distinction is that our expression , which involves the effective counterion density @xmath44 , incorporates excluded volume corrections , at least in an approximate fashion .",
    "although not likely of significant consequence at the small volume fractions considered in refs .  @xcite and @xcite , such effects may become important at higher concentrations  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the linear response approach of silbert _ et al _",
    "@xcite offers a powerful tool for investigating effective electrostatic interactions in charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions . as demonstrated here , a consistent extension to finite - sized macroions leads directly to ( 1 ) an effective pair interaction between pseudo - macroions having precisely the dlvo screened - coulomb form , but with a modified inverse screening length that incorporates excluded volume corrections , and ( 2 ) a density - dependent volume energy that can make a significant contribution to the total free energy of salt - free suspensions . by including the next higher - order response function [ @xmath116 in eq .",
    "( [ rhoc ] ) ] , the approach can be straightforwardly generalized to include _ nonlinear _ response of microions and thereby used to assess the importance of effective three - body interactions  @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to approximating the counterion free energy [ eq .",

    "an expression for an effective triplet interaction already has been derived from a density - functional approach  @xcite .",

    "experience from _ ab initio _",
    "simulations  @xcite and from the realm of metals  @xcite suggests that many - body effects become significant at sufficiently high densities .",

    "<S> the response approach is extended to suspensions of _ finite - sized _ macroions and used to derive explicit expressions for ( 1 ) an effective electrostatic pair interaction between pseudo - macroions and ( 2 ) an associated volume energy that contributes to the total free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation recovers precisely the form of the dlvo screened - coulomb effective pair interaction for spherical macroions and makes manifest the important influence of the volume energy on thermodynamic properties of deionized suspensions . </S>",
    "<S> excluded volume corrections are implicitly incorporated through a natural modification of the inverse screening length . by including _ nonlinear _ response of counterions to macroions , </S>",
    "<S> the theory may be generalized to systematically investigate effective _ many - body _ interactions . </S>"
