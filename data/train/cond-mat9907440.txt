    "in recent years low - dimensional quantum spin systems have attracted a great deal of attention . very recently",
    ", ishii et al.@xcite have experimentally studied a trimerized quantum spin chain @xmath1 .",
    "they have measured the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility , and the magnetization curve at low temperatures .",
    "their results show that the magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 behaves as @xmath10 at @xmath11 and there exists the critical magnetic field where the magnetization rises up from zero .",
    "thus they have concluded that the ground state of this substance is nonmagnetic . from the result of structure - analysis experiment @xcite , the chain is composed of stacked @xmath0 @xmath12 trimers and separated from other chains by large molecules @xmath13 .",
    "therefore this substance is thought to be well modeled by independent chains of stacked trimers and they have proposed a model shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xcite .",
    "solid lines denote the intra - trimer coupling @xmath2 , wavy lines the inter - trimer coupling @xmath3 , and dotted lines the inter - trimer coupling @xmath4.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this paper we call this model the distorted diamond ( dd ) chain model .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is written as @xmath14 where three spins @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 form a trimer .",
    "all the coupling constants are supposed to be positive ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "although it is thought that @xmath18 in @xmath1 because of its structure , we do not restrict ourselves to this case .",
    "we note that the point @xmath19 is equivalent to the point @xmath20 by interchanging the role of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath2 as the energy unit and set @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if we transform the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) into the fermion representation through the jordan - wigner transformation , we can see that the fermionic band gap exists at @xmath21 but not at @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the saturation magnetization @xcite .",
    "thus the trimerization itself can not be the direct reason for the nonmagnetic ground state .",
    "this can also be explained by considering the necessary condition for the appearance of magnetization plateau proposed by oshikawa , yamanaka and affleck @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the periodicity of the ground - state wave function , @xmath26 the magnitude of spins and @xmath27 the average magnetization per one spin in the plateau . the periodicity of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) itself is @xmath28 .",
    "we see that @xmath29 does not satisfy the condition ( [ eq : oya ] ) with @xmath0 and @xmath30 .",
    "then , if the present model is applicable to @xmath1 , its ground - state wave function should have the periodicity at least @xmath31 due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this paper , we explain why the non - magnetic ground state is realized and draw the ground - state phase diagram on the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the @xmath32 case of the present model was named the diamond chainand investigated by takano , kubo and sakamoto ( tks ) @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the ground state of the diamond chain is composed of three phases ; the ferrimagnetic phase ( @xmath21 ) for @xmath33 , the tetramer - dimer phase for @xmath34 and the dimer - monomer phase for @xmath35 .",
    "the relation between the present model and tks s model will be discussed later .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we explain the mechanism for the non - magnetic ground state by use of the analytical method and a physical consideration . in  3 , we obtain the phase diagram from the numerical data of diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) for finite systems by use of the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussions .",
    "we consider three special cases at first .",
    "when @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the present model is reduced to the simple @xmath0 chain with nearest - neighbor interactions , the ground state of which is the spin - fluid ( sf ) state , as is well known . in case of @xmath38 , the ground state may be ferrimagnetic ( @xmath39 ) , because the state with @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the classical ground state . at the point @xmath42",
    ", the chain is truncated into an array of independent trimers .    [ 0.5 ] case in the linear chain form.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.5 ]    next , let us consider the @xmath43 case .",
    "if we re - draw the model in the single chain form as in figure 2 , we see this is closely related to the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction model in figure 3 . in fact , the model of figure 2 is obtained from that of figure 3 by removing one nnn interaction of every three nnn interactions .",
    "the important point is that every spin feels the frustration .",
    "the nnn interaction model is one of the most important models having the frustration and is extensively studied @xcite .",
    "when @xmath44 , the ground state of the nnn interaction model is an array of independent singlet dimers , where the translational symmetry by one spin spacing is spontaneously broken @xcite . then there should exist the critical point of the ground - state phase transition between the spin - fluid ( sf ) state and the dimer state .",
    "okamoto and nomura @xcite numerically determined this sf - dimer critical point , @xmath45 .",
    "since the model of figure 2 is very similar to that of figure 3 , as stated , the sf - dimer transition may occur also in the model of figure 2 when @xmath46 is increased .",
    "this can be confirmed by the bosonization technique in the following way .",
    "the effective hamilton of the model of figure 3 in the continuum limit is written as @xcite @xmath47     + \\frac{y_{\\phi}v_{\\rm s}}{2\\pi}\\int { \\rm d }",

    "the renormalized value of @xmath49 should be @xmath51 .",

    "we note that the spin wave velocity @xmath48 is slightly different between two models , but it does not bring about any essential effect .",
    "thus we can conclude that the model of figure 2 also shows the sf - dimer phase transition . since @xmath64 in equation ( [ eq : y - nnn ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath65 in equation ( [ eq : y - dd ] ) , the critical value @xmath66 is naively obtained by letting @xmath67 , which leads to @xmath68 by using @xmath69 . in fact , as shown in  3 , the numerical result is @xmath70 .",
    "the dimer ground - state wave function in the model of figure 2 is two - fold degenerate with periodicity @xmath31 and is shown in figure 4 .",
    "[ 0.5 ] in the single chain form .",
    "two spins in an ellipse form a singlet dimer pair , title=\"fig : \" ] [ 0.5 ] in the single chain form .",
    "two spins in an ellipse form a singlet dimer pair , title=\"fig : \" ]    when @xmath71 , we have to take the trimerization effects into the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the @xmath22 subspace , the trimerization does not bring about the mass - generating term such as @xmath55-term in equation ( [ eq : sg - nnn ] ) , although it slightly modifies the spin wave velocity @xmath48 .",
    "then , as far as the trimerization is not so large ( not so far from the @xmath43 line ) , the dd chain model also exhibits the sf - dimer phase transition .",
    "the dimer configuration of the dd chain model is easily known by tracing back of the model mapping , which is shown in figure 5 .",
    "this ground - state wave function is also two - fold degenerate with periodicity @xmath31 .",
    "[ 0.5 ] [ 0.5 ]    here we summarize the critical properties of the sf - dimer transition using the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : sg - nnn ] ) having the sine - gordon form .",
    "the renormalization group calculation leads to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an infrared cutoff , and @xmath74 the flow diagram of is shown in figure 6 , from which we see that the sf - dimer transition is of the berezinnskii - kostelitz - thouless type , as is well known . since our model is isotropic , the renormalized value of @xmath49 should be equal to unity , as already stated .",
    "then , when the system is in the sf state , the starting point of the renormalization lies on the sf - nel boundary line which flows into the origin where @xmath51 , and moves as @xmath75 , as @xmath46 increases .",
    "finally the sf - dimer transition takes place when the starting point arrives at the origin . in the sf state , @xmath76 in equation ( [ eq : rg ] ) , resulting in @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the bare value of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the cutoff length .",
    "then , there appear logarithmic corrections in various physical quantities at every place in the sf region in our isotropic ( i.e. , @xmath81 symmetric ) model . on the sf - dimer critical point ( origin o ) , on the other hand ,",
    "the logarithmic corrections vanish because @xmath82 .",
    "this is very peculiar to the isotropic case .",
    "since the sf - dimer transition occurs at @xmath83 , one may think that the sf - dimer critical point can be obtained from equations ( [ eq : y - nnn ] ) or ( [ eq : y - dd ] ) . however , as stated , the expressions ( [ eq : y - nnn ] ) and ( [ eq : y - dd ] ) are valid only in the lowest order of @xmath58 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , although the critical properties are well expressed by the effective hamiltonian .",
    "then it needs the numerical calculation for determining the sf - dimer critical point even in case of @xmath43 .    [ 0.4 ] ) .",
    "the phase boundaries are shown by thick lines . in our isotropic case ,",
    "the starting point of the renormalization lies on the sf - nel boundary line . as @xmath46 increases , the starting point moves as @xmath84 .",
    "if the system has the @xmath59 symmetry with @xmath85 , the starting point of the renormalization moves as @xmath86.,title=\"fig : \" ]    if the model has the @xmath59 symmetry ( no longer isotropic ) with @xmath85 , the starting point of the renormalization moves as @xmath86 as @xmath46 increases .",
    "when the starting point arrived at @xmath87 , the sf - dimer transition occurs .",
    "then , in the @xmath59 symmetric case , the logarithmic corrections exist only at the sf - dimer critical point , and do not exist in the sf region .",
    "to confirm the consideration in  2 and to obtain the ground - state phase diagram on the @xmath5 plane , we performed the numerical diagonalization for finite systems for @xmath88 by use of lanczos algorithm under the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is very easy to distinguish whether the ground state is ferrimagnetic ( @xmath21 ) or @xmath22 from the numerical data .",
    "however , it is difficult to detect the sf - dimer critical point from the numerical data , because this transition is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type @xcite with pathological critical behavior .",
    "okamoto and nomura ( on ) @xcite developed a method by use of which the sf - dimer critical point of the @xmath0 nnn interaction model of figure 3 can be successfully determined from the numerical data for the energy gaps .",
    "let us explain this method , focusing on its physical meaning . in usual cases , the ground state is unique ( not twofold degenerate ) in finite systems , except for the special cases such as the ising model and the majumdar - ghosh model @xcite .",
    "how the twofold degenerate ground state is realized in infinite systems ?",
    "the energy gap of a low - lying excited state of finite systems rapidly decreases as the system size @xmath89 increases , and finally degenerate to the ground state in @xmath90",
    ". then the linear combination of the ground state and the above - mentioned excited state results in the twofold degenerate ground state of the infinite systems . in our case",
    ", the ground state of finite systems has the property @xmath91 as far as it lies in the @xmath22 subspace ( i.e. , except for the ferrimagnetic case ) .",
    "the twofold degenerate dimer state of infinite systems also has the property @xmath91 .",
    "then the above - mentioned excited state should be also of @xmath91 , because of the law of the addition of the angular momentum .",
    "then we can conclude that the lowest excitation in finite systems is of @xmath91 in the dimer region . in the sf region , on the other hand",
    ", the lowest excitation should be of the spin - wave type with @xmath92 ( one magnon state ) . in the present case , the excitation with the same energy exists in the @xmath93 subspace due to the isotropic nature .",
    "this means that the system has three - fold degenerate lowest excitation with @xmath94 , when it lies in the sf region .    from the above physical consideration",
    ", we can write down the criterion @xmath95 where @xmath96(n ) and @xmath97(n ) are the singlet - singlet energy gap and singlet - triplet energy gap for a finite - size system with @xmath89 spins , defined by @xmath98 respectively . here",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 are the lowest and second lowest energies in the subspace with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",

    "figure 8 shows the extrapolation of @xmath110 to @xmath90 in case of @xmath104 , resulting in @xmath112 .    by sweeping parameters ,",
    "we finally obtain the phase diagram on the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the result is shown in figure 9 .",

    "in  2 , we have stated that the ground - state quantum phase transition of the dd chain model ( the present model ) has the same universality class as that of the nnn model ( figure 3 ) .",

    "figure 12 shows the sf - dimer critical point @xmath119 of the interpolation model , in which the critical point smoothly changes .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that the ground - state quantum phase transition of the dd chain model ( the present model ) has the same universality class as that of the nnn interaction model ( figure 3 ) . the dd chain model with @xmath43",

    "may be realized by decreasing the strength of the nnn interaction to @xmath120 of the original strength .",
    "if this is the case , the sf - dimer critical point of the dd chain model with @xmath43 is @xmath121 of that of the nnn interaction model , which results in @xmath122 .",

    "the ferrimagnetic phase ( @xmath21 ) appears when @xmath33 . in the tetramer - dimer ( td )",

    "figure 13(c ) shows the dimer - monomer ( dm ) state , appearing when @xmath127 , which is composed of the regular array of the singlet dimers and free spins . because of the free spins , the dm state is macroscopically degenerate .",
    "let us discuss the relation between our model and tks s model . in the dm state of tks s model",
    ", the monomers are completely free but this is very peculiar to this model . in our model , since the symmetry of a diamond is broken because @xmath128 , the monomer is no longer free and has an effective interaction between neighboring monomers through the dimer between them .",
    "therefore the dm state of tks s model is smoothly connected to the spin - fluid state of our model , as can be seen in figure 9 .",
    "the tetramer in the td state is also special to tks s model . when the symmetry of the diamond is broken , the tetramer is decomposed into two dimers existing on stronger bonds , as is shown in figure 5 .",
