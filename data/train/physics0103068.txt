    "experimental investigations of lorentz symmetry provide important tests of the standard model of particle physics and general relativity .",
    "while the standard model successfully describes particle phenomenology , it is believed to be the low energy limit of a fundamental theory that incorporates gravity .",
    "this underlying theory may be lorentz invariant , yet contain spontaneous symmetry - breaking that could result in small violations of lorentz invariance and cpt at the level of the standard model .",
    "a theoretical framework has been developed to describe lorentz and cpt violation at the level of the standard model by kosteleck and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this standard - model extension is quite general : it emerges as the low - energy limit of any underlying theory that generates the standard model and contains spontaneous lorentz symmetry violation @xcite .",
    "for example , such characteristics might emerge from string theory @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the standard model extension is that it is formulated at the level of the known elementary particles , and thus enables quantitative comparison of a wide array of searches for lorentz and cpt violation @xcite .",
    "`` clock comparison experiments '' are searches for temporal variations in atomic energy levels . according to the standard model extension considered here",
    ", lorentz and cpt violation may produce shifts in certain atomic levels , whose magnitude depends on the orientation of the atom s quantization axis relative to a fixed inertial frame @xcite .",
    "certain atomic transition frequencies , therefore , may exhibit sinusoidal variation as the earth rotates on its axis .",
    "new limits can be placed on lorentz and cpt violation by bounding sidereal variation of these atomic transition frequencies .",
    "specifically , the description of lorentz and cpt violation is included in the relativistic lagrange density of the constituent particles of the atom .",
    "for example , the modified electron lagrangian becomes @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent possible vacuum expectation values of lorentz tensors generated through spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking in an underlying theory .",
    "these are absent in the standard model .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent coupling strengths for terms that violate both cpt and lorentz symmetry , while @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath13 violate lorentz symmetry only .",
    "an analogous expression exists for the modified proton and neutron lagrangians ( a superscript will be appended to differentiate between the sets of parameters ) .",
    "the standard model extension treats only the free particle properties of the constituent particles , estimating that all interaction effects will be of higher order @xcite . as a result , the interaction term @xmath14 is unchanged from the conventional , lorentz invariant , qed interaction term .    within this phenomenological framework ,",
    "the values of these parameters are not calculable ; instead , values must be determined experimentally .",
    "the general nature of this theory ensures that different experimental searches may place bounds on different combinations of lorentz and cpt violating terms , while direct comparisons between these experiments are possible ( see table [ tab.compare ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the leading - order lorentz and cpt violating energy level shifts for a given atom are obtained by summing over the individual free particle shifts of the atomic constituents . from the symmetry violating correction to the relativistic lagrangian , a non - relativistic correction hamiltonian @xmath15 is found using standard field theory techniques @xcite . assuming lorentz and cpt violating effects to be small ,",
    "the energy level shifts are calculated perturbatively by taking the expectation value of the correction hamiltonian with respect to the unperturbed atomic states , leading to a shift in an atomic ( @xmath16 ) sublevel given by @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the number of each type of particle and @xmath19 is the corresponding correction hamiltonian .",
    "note that for most atoms , the interpretation of energy level shifts in terms of this standard model extension is reliant on the particular model used to describe the atomic nucleus ( e.g. , the schmidt model ) .",
    "one key advantage of a study in hydrogen is the simplicity of the nuclear structure ( a single proton ) , with its results uncompromised by any nuclear model uncertainty .    among",
    "the most recent clock comparison experiments are penning trap tests by dehmelt and co - workers with the electron and positron @xcite which place a limit on electron lorentz and cpt violation at 10@xmath20 gev .",
    "a recent re - analysis by adelberger , gundlach , heckel , and co - workers of existing data from the `` et - wash ii '' spin - polarized torsion pendulum @xcite has improved this to a level of 10@xmath21 gev @xcite , the most stringent bound to date on lorentz and cpt violation of the electron .",

    "this work reports a bound of less than 1 mhz for these terms .",

    "the shift in the @xmath0 , @xmath30 zeeman frequency is @xcite : @xmath32 the subscripts denote the projection of the tensor couplings onto the laboratory frame .",
    "therefore , as the earth rotates relative to a fixed inertial frame , the zeeman frequency @xmath33 will exhibit a sidereal variation .",
    "we have recently published the result of a search for this variation of the @xmath0 , @xmath30 zeeman frequency in hydrogen using hydrogen masers @xcite .",

    "the atoms travel ballistically for about 1 second before escaping , making @xmath53 collisions with the bulb wall .",
    "a teflon coating reduces the atom - wall interaction and thus inhibits decoherence of the masing atomic ensemble by wall collisions .",
    "the maser bulb is centered inside a cylindrical te@xmath54 microwave cavity resonant with the 1420 mhz hyperfine transition .",
    "the microwave field stimulates a small , coherent magnetization in the atomic ensemble , and this magnetization acts as a source to stimulate the microwave field . with sufficiently high atomic flux and low cavity losses",
    ", this feedback induces active maser oscillation .",
    "the maser signal is inductively coupled out of the microwave cavity and amplified with an external receiver . surrounding the cavity",
    ", a solenoid produces the weak static magnetic field ( @xmath55 1 mg ) that establishes the quantization axis inside the maser bulb and sets the zeeman frequency ( @xmath55 1 khz ) .",
    "a pair of helmholtz coils produces the oscillating transverse magnetic field that drives the @xmath0 , @xmath46 zeeman transitions .",
    "the cavity , solenoid , and zeeman coils are all enclosed within several layers of high permeability magnetic shielding .     which defines a quantization axis inside the maser bulb .",
    "the microwave cavity field @xmath56 ( dashed field lines ) and the coherent magnetization @xmath57 of the atomic ensemble form the coupled actively oscillating system . ]    a well engineered hydrogen maser can have fractional stabilities approaching @xmath58 over intervals of hours .",
    "this stability is enabled by a long atom - field interaction time ( 1 s ) , a low atom - wall interaction ( due to the low atomic polarizability of h and the wall s teflon coating ) , reduced doppler effects ( the atoms are confined to a region of uniform microwave field phase , effectively averaging their velocity to zero over the interaction time with the field ) , and multiple layers of thermal control of the cavity ( stabilizing cavity pulling shifts ) .      among the quantities used to characterize a hydrogen maser , those most relevant to this experiment are the atomic line - q @xmath59 , the population decay rate @xmath60 , the hyperfine decoherence rate @xmath61 , the atomic flow rate into and out of the bulb @xmath62 , and the maser rabi frequency @xmath63 .",

    "the italicized values for p-28 were inferred from double resonance fit parameters as described in sec .",

    "all other values were either calculated or extracted from direct measurements as described in this section . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to make a more sensitive measure of the sidereal variation of the zeeman frequency in a hydrogen maser , it will be important to clearly identify and reduce the magnitude of the long term drifts of the zeeman frequency .",
    "possible sources of these drifts are magnetic fields near the maser bulb caused by stray currents in heaters or power supplies in the inner regions of the maser .",
    "also , the scatter of the zeeman data points , believed to be due mainly to residual thermal fluctuations , should be reduced .",
    "both of these objectives could be accomplished by carefully rebuilding a hydrogen maser , with better engineered power and temperature control systems .",

    "maser p-8 is housed permanently in our laboratory , so much of our characterization was done with this maser . however , this maser was not suitable for a lorentz symmetry test because it suffered from large , long term zeeman frequency drifts , attributed to less magnetic shielding and larger extraneous fields ( e.g. , from heating elements ) ."
