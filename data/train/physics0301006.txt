    "formation of dna loops is a common motif of protein - dna interactions  @xcite . a segment of dna forms a loop - like structure when either its ends get bound by the same protein molecule or a multi - protein complex , or when the segment gets wound around a large multi - protein aggregate , or when the segment connects two such aggregates . in bacterial genomes , dna loops were shown to play important roles in gene regulation  @xcite ; in eucaryotic genomes , dna loops are a common structural element of the condensed protein - dna media inside nuclei  @xcite .",
    "understanding of the structure and dynamics of dna loops is thus vital for studying the organization and function of the genomes of living cells .    the amount of experimental data on the dna physical properties and protein - dna interactions both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _ has grown dramatically in recent years  @xcite . with the advent of modern experimental techniques , such as micromanipulation  @xcite and fast resonance energy transfer  @xcite , researchers were presented with unique opportunities to probe the properties of individual macromolecules .",
    "x - ray crystallography , nmr , and 3d electron cryomicroscopy  @xcite provided numerous structures of protein - dna complexes with resolution up to a few angstroms , including such huge biomolecular aggregates as rna polymerase  @xcite and nucleosome  @xcite .",
    "the ever growing volume of data provides theoretical modeling , which has generally been recognized as a vital complement of experimental studies , with an opportunity to revise the existing models , and to build new improved models of biomolecules and biomolecular interactions .",
    "several existing dna models are based on the theory of elasticity  @xcite .",
    "these models treat dna as an elastic rod or ribbon , sometimes carrying an electric charge .",
    "the geometrical , energetic , and dynamical properties of such ribbon can be studied at finite temperature using monte - carlo or brownian dynamics techniques employing a combined elastic / electrostatic energy functional  @xcite .",
    "such studies usually involve extensive data generation , for example , numerous monte carlo structural ensembles , and require significant investment of computational resources .",
    "alternatively , one could resort to faster theoretical methods , such as statistical mechanical analysis of the elastic energy functional  @xcite or normal mode analysis of the dynamical properties of the elastic rod  @xcite .",
    "a fast approach to studying the static properties of dna loops  such as the loop energy , structure , and topology  consists in solving the classical equations of elasticity  @xcite , dated back to kirchhoff  @xcite and derived on the basis of the same energy functional .",
    "the equations can be solved with either fixed boundary conditions for the ends of the loop or under a condition of a constant external force acting on the ends of the loop  @xcite .    in order to achieve a realistic description of the physical properties of dna",
    ", the classical elastic functional  @xcite has to be modified : ( i ) the modeled elastic ribbon has to be considered intrinsically twisted ( and , possibly , intrinsically bent ) in order to mimic the helicity of dna , ( ii ) the ribbon has to carry electrostatic charge , ( iii ) be anisotropically flexible , i.e. , different bending penalties should be imposed for bending in different directions , ( iv ) be deformable , e.g. , through extension and/or shear , ( v ) have different flexibility at different points , in order to account for dna sequence - specific properties , ( vi ) be subject to possible external forces , such as those from proteins or other dna loops .",
    "the earlier works have presented many models including several of these properties , e.g. , bending anisotropy and sequence - specificity  @xcite ; extensibility , intrinsic twist / curvature , and electrostatics  @xcite ; extensibility , shearability , and intrinsic twist  @xcite ; intrinsic curvature and electrostatics  @xcite ; or intrinsic twist and forces due to self - contact  @xcite .    yet , to the best of our knowledge , a completely realistic treatment , where the theory of elasticity would be modified as to include all of the listed dna properties , has never been published . while for dna segments of large length some of these properties can be disregarded or averaged out using a proper set of effective parameters , we feel that a proper model of dna on the scale of several hundred base pairs  which is a typical size of dna loops involved in protein - dna interactions  must be detailed , including a proper description of all physical properties of real dna .",

    "notably , it is shown how the elastic rod model can be combined with the all - atom model in multi - scale simulations of protein - dna complexes or how all - atom dna structures can be built on the basis of the coarse - grained model .",
    "in this section we describe first the classical kirchhoff theory of elasticity and then how this theory can be applied to modeling dna loops .",
    "the classical theory of elasticity describes an elastic rod ( ribbon ) in terms of its centerline and cross sections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elrod]a )",
    ". the centerline forms a three - dimensional curve @xmath1 parametrized by the arclength  _ s_. the cross sections are `` stacked '' along the centerline ; a frame of three unit vectors @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 uniquely defines the orientation of the cross section at each point  @xmath0 .",
    "the vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 lie in the plane of the cross section ( for example , along the principal axes of inertia of the cross section ) , and the vector @xmath7 is the normal to that plane  .",
    "therefore , we frequently drop the explicit notation `` @xmath8 '' from the equations throughout the paper . ] .",
    "if the elastic rod is inextensible then the tangent to the center line coincides with the normal @xmath9 : @xmath10 ( the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath0 ) .",
    "parameterization of the elastic rod .",
    "( a ) the centerline @xmath11 and the intrinsic local frame @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) the principal normal @xmath12 and the binormal @xmath13 form the natural local frame for the 3d curve @xmath11  @xcite . ]",
    "the components of all the three vectors @xmath14 can be expressed through three euler angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which define the rotation of the local coordinate frame @xmath18  relative to the lab coordinate frame .",
    "alternatively , one can use four euler parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , related to the euler angles as @xmath23 and subject to the constraint @xmath24 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the computations presented in this paper employ the euler parameters in order to avoid the polar singularities inherent in the euler angles .",
    "following kirchhoff s analogy between the sequence of cross - sections of the elastic rod and a motion of a rigid body , the arclength @xmath0 can be considered as a time - like variable",
    ". then the spatial angular velocity  @xmath25 of rotation of the local coordinate frame can be introduced : @xmath26 the vector @xmath25 is called the vector of strains  @xcite .",
    "geometrically , its components @xmath27 and @xmath28 are equal to the principal curvatures of the curve @xmath11 , so that the total curvature equals @xmath29 and the vectors of principal normal @xmath30 and binormal @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elrod]b ) are @xmath32 the third component of the vector of strains @xmath33 is the local twist of the elastic rod around its axis @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "all three components can be expressed via the euler parameters @xmath34  @xcite : @xmath35    if the elastic rod is forced to adopt a shape different from that of its natural ( relaxed ) shape , then elastic forces @xmath36 and torques @xmath37 develop inside the rod : @xmath38 the components @xmath39 and @xmath40 compose the shear force @xmath41 ; the component @xmath42 is the force of tension , if @xmath43 , or compression , if @xmath44 , at the cross section at the point @xmath0 . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the bending moments , and @xmath47 is the twisting moment . in equilibrium ,",
    "the elastic forces and torques are balanced at every point @xmath0 by the body forces @xmath48 and torques @xmath49 , acting upon the rod : @xmath50 the body forces and torques of the classical theory usually result from gravity or from the weight of external bodies  as in the case of construction beams . in the case of dna ,",
    "such forces are mainly of electrostatic nature , as will be described below .",
    "the last equation required to build a self - contained theory of the elastic rod relates the elastic stress to the distortions of the rod .",
    "the classical approach stems from the bernoulli - euler theory of slender rods , which stipulates the elastic torques @xmath37 to be linearly dependent on the curvatures and twist of the inherently straight rod : @xmath51 the linear coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 are called the bending rigidities of the elastic rod , and @xmath54 is called the twisting rigidity . for a solid rod , the classical theory finds that @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the young s modulus of the material of the rod , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the principal moments of inertia of the rod s cross - section .",
    "the twisting rigidity @xmath54 is proportional to the shear modulus @xmath60 of the material of the rod ; in the simple case of a circular cross - section , @xmath61 .    the equations , , , , and form the basis of the kirchhoff theory of elastic rods .",
    "we simplify the equations , first , by making all the variables dimensionless : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the length of the rod .",
    "second , we express the derivatives @xmath64 through @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and the euler parameters , using equations  ( [ eq : cur_eu1]-[eq : cur_euo ] ) and the constraint  , differentiated with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "third , we eliminate the variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 using equations   and arrive at the following system of differential equations of 13-th order  :    @xmath68    @xmath69    the solutions to this system correspond to the equilibrium conformations of the elastic rod .",
    "the 13 unknown functions   @xmath11 , @xmath70 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37   are directly obtainable from @xmath71 by virtue of  . ]",
    " describe the geometry of the elastic rod and the distribution of the stress and torques along the rod .",
    "the equations can be solved for various combinations of initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the case considered in this paper will be the boundary value problem , when the equilibrium solutions are sought for the elastic rod with fixed ends  that is , with known locations @xmath72",
    ", @xmath73 of its ends at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and known orientation @xmath76 , @xmath77 of the cross section at those ends .",
    "such case would correspond , for example , to a dna loop whose ends are bound to a protein .",
    "( a ) the elastic rod fitted into an all - atom structure of dna .",
    "( b ) a coordinate frame associated with a dna base pair , according to  @xcite . ]    in general , the system  ( [ eq : grand_1]-[eq : grand_11 ] ) has multiple solutions for a given set of boundary conditions .",
    "the dimensionless elastic energy of each solution is computed  according to the bernoulli - euler approximation    as the quadratic functional of the curvatures and the twist : @xmath78 the straight elastic rod becomes the zero - energy ground state for the functional  ( [ eq : ener_funct ] ) .",
    "if the interactions of the elastic rod with external bodies , expressed through the forces @xmath79 and torques @xmath80 , are not negligible then the energy functional will include additional terms due to those interactions .",
    "elastic rod theory is a natural choice for building a model of dna  a long linear polymer .",
    "the centerline of the rod follows the axis of the dna helix and watson - crick base pairs form cross - sections of the dna `` rod '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elrod_dna]a ) . a coordinate frame can be associated with each base pair according to a general convention  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elrod_dna]b ) . for a known all - atom structure of a dna loop , an elastic rod ( ribbon ) can be fitted into the loop using those coordinate frames .",
    "conversely , a known elastic rod model of the dna loop can be used directly to build an all - atom structure of the loop ( see app .  [",
    "sec : appendixf ] ) . finally , if the all - atom structure is known only for the base pairs at the ends of the loop ( as in the case of the _ lac _ repressor   cf sec .  [ sec : lac_solutions ] )",
    "then the coordinate frames @xmath18  can be associated with those base pairs and provide boundary conditions for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : grand_1]-[eq : grand_11 ] ) .    however , several modifications of the classical theory are necessary in order to describe certain essential properties of dna .",
    "first of all , the relaxed shape of dna is a helix , which is described by a tightly wound ribbon rather than a straight untwisted rod treated by our equations so far .",
    "the helix has an average twist of @xmath81/  so that one helical turn takes about 36   .",
    "this is much smaller than the persistent length of dna bending ( 500   ) or twisting ( 750   )  @xcite , so even a relatively straight segment of dna is highly twisted .",
    "we introduce the intrinsic twist @xmath82 of the elastic rod as a parameter in our model .",
    "it is considered to be a function of arclength @xmath0 , because the twist of real dna varies between different sequences  @xcite .",
    "second , certain dna sequences are also known to form intrinsically curved rather than straight helices  @xcite . in terms of our theory",
    "that means that the curvature of the relaxed rod may be different from zero in certain sections of the rod .",
    "the intrinsic curvatures @xmath83 are introduced in our model similarly to the intrinsic twist  as functions of arclength @xmath0 determined by the sequence of the dna piece in consideration .    the intrinsic twist and curvatures",
    "result in the modified bernoulli - euler equation  : @xmath84 where @xmath85    now , the elastic torques are proportional to the changes in the curvatures and twist from their intrinsic values , rather than to their total values .",
    "note , however , that the `` geometrical '' eqs .    and consequently , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : grand_5]-[eq : grand_8 ] )  still contain the full values of the twist and curvature , so that switching from eq .   to eq .",
    "does not simply result in replacing @xmath86 and @xmath67 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 throughout the system  ( [ eq : grand_1]-[eq : grand_11 ] ) .",
    "another important structural property of real dna , which we want to encapsulate in our theory , is the sequence - dependence of the dna flexibility , i.e. , that certain sequences of dna are more rigid than others  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the bending and twisting rigidities @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in eq .   become functions of arclength @xmath0 rather than constants . the exact shape of these functions depends on the sequence of the studied dna piece ( cf app .  [ sec : appendixd ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless bending rigidities @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( as well as the dimensionless forces and torques ) now become scaled not by @xmath54 , but by an arbitrary chosen value of the twisting modulus @xmath92 ( for example , the average twisting rigidity of dna ) : @xmath93 ( _ cf _ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod_scale_0],[eq : for_scale_0 ] ) ) .    with the above changes ,",
    "the new grand system of differential equations becomes :    @xmath94    and the new energy of the elastic rod is computed as : @xmath95    the system  ( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] ) describes the elastic rod model of dna in the most general terms .",
    "not all of the options provided by such model will be explored in the present work ; most times the equations will be simplified in one way or another .",
    "the unexplored possibilities and situations when they might become essential will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us observe two immediate results of switching from the classical equations  ( [ eq : grand_1]-[eq : grand_11 ] ) to the more realistic equations  ( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] ) .",
    "first , the high intrinsic twist @xmath82 results in strongly oscillatory behavior of solutions to the system  ( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] ) . due to the non - linear character of the system",
    ", the oscillatory component can not be separated from the rest of the solution .",
    "second , a dna loop that contains intrinsically bent segments ( those inside which @xmath96 ) may not be uniformly twisted  as it would be in the classic case ",
    "even if the loop were isotropically flexible ( @xmath97 ) and no external torques were acting upon the loop ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "whereas the classical theory necessitates that in such case @xmath99 ( _ cf _  eq .  ) , the right - hand part of the updated eq .",
    "is non - zero if @xmath100 .",
    "in this section we first describe the test case system for our theory : the complex of the _ lac _ repressor protein with dna .",
    "then this protein - dna system is used to illustrate the numeric algorithm of solving the equations of elasticity .",
    "finally , different solutions for the dna loop clamped by the _ lac _ repressor are presented .          for a test case study ,",
    "the developed theory was used to build a model of the dna loop induced in the _ e.  coli _",
    "genome by the _ lac _",
    "repressor  protein .",
    "_ lac _ repressor  functions as a switch that shuts down the lactose ( _ lac _ ) operon  a famous set of _",
    "e.  coli _  genes , the studies of which laid one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biology  @xcite .",
    "the genes code for proteins that are responsible for lactose digestion by the bacterium ; they are shut down by the _",
    "repressor  when lactose is not present in the environment .",
    "when lactose is present , a molecule of it binds inside the _ lac _",
    "repressor  and deactivates the protein , thereby inducing the expression of the _ lac _ operon  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lac_operon]a - b ) .",
    "the _ lac _ repressor  consists of two dna - binding `` hands '' , as it can be seen in the crystal structure of the protein  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lac_operon]c ) .",
    "each `` hand '' recognizes a specific 21-bp long sequence of dna , called the operator site .",
    "the _ lac _",
    "repressor  binds to two operator sequences and causes the dna connecting those sequences to fold into a loop .",
    "there are three operator sequences in the _ e.  coli _  genome : o@xmath101 , o@xmath102 , and o@xmath103  @xcite ; the repressor binds to o@xmath101 and either o@xmath102 or o@xmath103 , so that the resulting dna loop can have two possible lengths : 385  bp ( o@xmath101-o@xmath102 ) or 76  bp ( o@xmath101-o@xmath103 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lac_operon]b ) .",
    "all three operator sites are necessary for the maximum repression of the _ lac _ operon  @xcite .",
    "while the long o@xmath101-o@xmath102 loop ( 385  bp ) is the easier to form , the short o@xmath101-o@xmath103 loop ( 76  bp ) contains the _ lac _ operon  promoter   so that folding this 76  bp region into a loop is certain to disrupt the expression of the _ lac _ operon .    it would hardly be possible to crystallize the dna loops induced by the _",
    "repressor   merely because of their size  and thus the crystal structure  @xcite of the _ lac _ repressor  was obtained with only two disjoint operator dna segments bound to the protein  .",
    "the equations of elasticity , discussed above , can be used to build elastic rod structures of the missing loops , connecting the two dna segments .",
    "such structure would allow to further the study of the _ lac _ repressor - dna interactions in several ways .",
    "first , the force of the protein - dna interactions computed after solving the equations of elasticity can be used in modeling the changes in the structure of the _ lac _ repressor  that likely occur under the stress of the bent dna loop .",
    "second , the elastic rod structure of the loop may serve as a scaffold on which to build all - atom structures of its parts of interest  such as the binding sites of other proteins , important for the _ lac _ operon  expression , e.g. , rna polymerase and cap  or , indeed , of the whole loop ( cf app .",
    "[ sec : appendixf ] ) .",
    "all - atom simulations of these sites , either alone or with the proteins docked , may provide interesting keys to the interactions of the regulatory proteins with the bent dna loop and therefore , to the mechanism of the _ lac _ operon  repression .",
    "third , one can predict how changing the dna sequence in the loop would influence the interactions between the _ lac _ repressor  and the dna  by changing the sequence - dependent dna flexibility in our model and observing the resulting changes in the structure and energy of the dna loop .",
    "finally , the _ lac _ repressor  system can be used to tune the elastic model of dna per se , in terms of parameters and complexity level , by comparing the predictions resulting from our model with the experimental data .",
    "these questions will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , while the following sections will detail our study of the _ lac _ repressor  system .",

    "the reason for introducing such cutoff is that the dna elasticity has partially electrostatic origin , so that the energetic penalty for dna bending and twisting , approximated by the elastic functional  , already includes the contribution from electrostatic repulsion between the neighboring dna charges .",
    "it is debatable what `` neighboring '' implies here , i.e. , how close should two dna phosphates be in order to significantly contribute to dna elasticity . in this work , the cutoff distance @xmath158 is chosen to be equal to one step of the dna helix ( @xmath161=36 ) .",
    "this , on the one hand , is the size of the smallest structural unit of dna , beyond which it does not make sense at all to use a continuum model of the double helix ",
    "so , at the very least , the phosphate pairs within such unit should be excluded from the explicit electrostatic component . on the other hand ,",
    "the forces of interaction between the phosphates , separated by more than that distance from each other , are already much smaller than the elastic force , as will be shown below .",

    "the combination of twisting and bending caused the loops to flip up  as one can cause a piece of wire to flip up and down by twisting its ends between one s fingers .",
    "for the intermediate salt concentrations ( 10 - 20 mm ) the oscillations of the intermediate solutions between the two possible states resulted in non - convergence of the iterative procedure . in this respect , using the larger electrostatic exclusion radius improved convergence .",
    "for the exclusion radius of @xmath184 , the iterations did not converge for salt concentrations of 15 and 20 mm ; convergence for the 10 mm salt was achieved but resulted again in flipping up to the stable solutions . for the exclusion radius of @xmath199 , the iterations successfully converged to u@xmath130  and o@xmath130  solutions ( albeit somewhat changed due to the electrostatics ) for the 15 and 20 mm salt concentrations and did not converge for 10 mm only .",
    "such instability of the u@xmath130  and o@xmath130  loops serves , of course , as another argument for disregarding them in favor of the stable u and o solutions .    upon introducing the electrostatic self - repulsion ,",

    "[ sec : lacsols_short ]  was no longer possible .",
    "therefore , one could explore whether superhelical structures of the loop could be built by further twisting the ends of the loop .",
    "one extra turn around the cross - section at the @xmath75 end did generate new structures of the u and o loops . yet , those structures were so stressed and had such a high energy ( on the order of 50kt higher than their predecessors ) that it was obvious that those structures will not play any part at all in the real thermodynamic ensemble ot the _ lac _ repressor  loops .",
    "any further twisting of the ends resulted in non - convergence of the iterative procedure .",
    "clearly , this length of a dna loop is insufficient to produce a rich spectrum of superhelical structures .",
    "below , we will review the presented modeling method and its limitations , compare it with the previously reported similar models , discuss the possible applications and the further developments of the method , and summarize what has been learned about the _ lac _ repressor - dna complex .",
    "the presented modeling method consists in approximating dna loops with electrostatically charged elastic rods and computing their equilibrium conformations by solving the modified kirchhoff equations of elasticity .",
    "the solutions to these equations provide zero - temperature structures of dna loops  the equilibrium points , around which the loops fluctuate at a finite temperature . from these solutions",
    ", one can automatically obtain both global and local structural parameters , such as the twist and curvature at every point of the loop , the loop s radius of gyration , the linking number of the loop and its distribution between writhe and twist , various protein - dna distances , the distances between dna sites of special interest , etc .",
    "the solutions readily provide an estimate of the energy of the dna loop and the forces that the protein has to muster in order to confine the loop termini to the given conformation , the distribution of the energy between bending and twisting , and the profiles of stress and energy along the dna loop .",
    "our method allows to build a family of topologically different loop structures by applying such simple geometrical transformations as twisting and rotating the loop ends , or varying the initial loop conformation that serves as the starting point for solving the bvp . by comparing the energies of the topologically different conformations and assuming the boltzmann probability to find the real dna loop in either of them , one can either deduce the lowest energy structure which the loop should predominantly adopt  as was mostly the case in the studied _ lac _ repressor - dna complex  or to compute the loop properties of interest by taking boltzmann averages among several obtained structures of comparable energies .    for dna loops of a size of several persistence lengths ( 150  bp  @xcite ) , only a few topologically different structures of comparable energy can exist and our simplified search of the conformational space should be sufficient to discover all members of the topological ensemble  as it has been demonstrated in this work .",
    "yet longer dna loops should produce large topological families of structures and , unless a fast exhaustive search procedure is discovered , this limits the applicability of our method to dna loop on the order of or shorter than 1,000  bp .",
    "the method is still good for generating sample structures of longer loops , but more structures of comparable energy are likely to be missed .",
    "the lower boundary of applicability of our method is stipulated by the loop diameter : the kirchhoff theory is applicable only if the elastic rod is much longer than its diameter .",
    "the diameter of the dna double helix is 2  nm , which is equivalent to 6  bp .",
    "therefore , the loop studied by our method should be at least several times longer than that : roughly , 50  bp and longer .",
    "ideally , one would request that the loop exceed the persistence length of dna , yet proteins are known to bend dna on smaller scales  as , for example , the _ lac _ repressor  does ",
    "so we apply the theory to dna loops of around 100  bp in length .    hence , we suggest that the presented model can be applied to studying the conformations of dna loops of about 100  bp to 1,000  bp length . building",
    "a single conformation is a fast process that takes only several hours of computation on a single workstation .",
    "the problem can be solved for a certain set of boundary conditions , as presented here  or the loop boundaries can be systematically moved and rotated and the dependence of the loop properties on the boundary conditions can be studied by re - solving the problem in each new case .",
    "such approach has the advantage over the monte carlo simulations in avoiding having to build and analyze a massive set of structures sampling the conformational space .    at a finite temperature , the dna loops exist as an ensemble of conformations . while generating all feasible topologically different structures , our method still neglects the thermal vibrations of each of them and the related entropic effects . yet , those effects are likely to be insignificant , since the length of the studied dna loops is limited to several persistence lengths , as discussed above",
    ". the related thermal oscillations of the loop structure should be small , although a separate study to quantify the effect of the oscillations seems worthwhile . for longer dna loops , an extensive sampling of the conformational space  for example , using the monte carlo approach ",
    "is indispensable .",
    "compared to the pre - existing analytical and computational dna models based on the theory of elasticity  @xcite , our model provides a universal and flexible description of dna properties and interactions .",
    "most previous methods either considered the dna to be isotropically flexible  @xcite , or did not consider the effects of the dna intrinsic twist and curvature  @xcite , or limited the treatment to a purely elastic model , that is , to the cases when the electrostatic properties of dna could be disregarded  @xcite . in the present work , a model of anisotropically flexible , electrostatically charged dna with intrinsic twist and intrinsic curvature has been employed , kirchhoff equations were derived in their most general form  ( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] ) , and all these dna properties have been extensively studied in the case of the _ lac _ repressor  loops . as it has been shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropy ] , the combination of the intrinsic twist with the anisotropic flexibility is essential in order to correctly estimate the energy of the dna loop , as well as the local bend and twist at each point of the loop .",
    "the electrostatic interactions are important in the case of a close contact of the loop with itself or with other molecules ( sec .",
    "[ sec : electrostatics ] ) .",
    "the universality of our approach allows us to include all these cases into the scope of approachable problems .",
    "moreover , all the dna parameters : the bending moduli , the intrinsic twist and curvature , the charge density  are treated in our equations as functions of the arclength .",
    "this provides an automatic tool for studying the sequence - dependent properties of the dna loops .",
    "the elastic moduli and intrinsic parameters need to be specified for different dna sequences , e.g. , as outlined in  @xcite",
    ". then the properties of any loop are approximated by functions @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath83 , @xmath207 , smoothly changing their values between those associated with each base pair in the loop sequence ( as discussed in app .",
    "[ sec : appendixd ] ) and the influence of the dna sequence on the conformation and energy of that loop can be studied by simply substituting their functions associated with different dna sequences into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] ) . of course",
    ", extensive testing of such parameters and comparison with experimental results on dna bending and loop energetics has to be done prior to performing any such studies of sequence - dependent effects .",
    "another opportunity that our model provides consists in its ability to mimic the effect of protein binding within dna loops .",
    "for example , if a protein is known to bend dna over a certain region   then the intrinsic curvature term can be adjusted so as to enforce the required curvature over that region of the dna loop . to strictly enforce the curvature ,",
    "the rigidity of that region would have to be increased as well .",
    "studying the solutions to the kirchhoff equations with such intrinsic curvature term would reveal what changes to the energy and conformation occur in the dna loop upon binding of the specified protein .",
    "a recent study  @xcite of the cap protein binding within the _ lac _ repressor  loop , performed in this vein , suggested an explanation for the experimentally observed cooperation between the cap and the _ lac _ repressor  in dna binding  @xcite .",
    "certainly , the different features of our model have to be used only as each specific problems dictates .",
    "for example , the model of isotropically flexible dna seems sufficient for determining the global properties of dna loops , such as the linking numbers of different conformations , their radii of gyration , or the energy distribution between bend and twist . in the present study , increasing the complexity of the model and varying the elasticity properties did not much change the shape of the loop , which determines these global properties ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : iter_short ] , [ fig : long_sols]-[fig : range_0 ] , [ fig : el_eff ] , [ fig : ion_change ] ) .",
    "presumably , the reduced model should be sufficient for computing the global properties of other dna loops .",
    "if , however , the energy of the loop has to be estimated , or the energies of different loop conformations need to be compared , or , indeed , the local structure at a certain point of the loop needs to be predicted , with a view to study how binding of a certain protein in that area changes upon the loop formation  then the anisotropic loop model becomes imperative , as it has been demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropy ] . finally , the problems which involve loop conformations with a near self - contact  such as those of the o loop or the tightly wound superhelical structures  @xcite  necessitate including the electrostatic force term into kirchhoff equations .",
    "the same holds for the problems studying the effect of salt concentration on structure and energetics of dna loops .",
    "the speed and high adaptability of our modeling approach makes it a good candidate for multi - scale modeling simulations .",
    "the most obvious application would be to study the structure and dynamics of a system similar to the _ lac _ repressor - dna complex : a protein or a protein aggregate holding a long dna loop .",
    "the structure of the loop and the forces and torques that the loop exerts on the protein are directly obtainable from the elastic rod computations .",
    "such forces would normally consist of the elastic forces at the loop boundaries and , perhaps , the electrostatic forces if parts of the dna loop approach the protein - dna complex closely .",
    "the electrostatic forces are directly computable from the predicted loop geometry .",
    "the forces and torques can then be plugged in an all - atom simulation of the structure of the protein aggregate and the dna segments directly bound to it , similarly to how it is done in steered molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "the state of the dna segments that provide the boundaries of the dna loop can be routinely checked during the all - atom simulations .",
    "whenever a notable change in the positions and orientations of the boundaries occur , the coarse - grained elastic computations have to be repeated ( using the previous solutions as the initial guess ) and the simulations continue with the updated values of the forces and torques .",
    "the fast coarse - grained computations presented here result in only a marginal increase in the total time required for the all - atom simulation .",
    "the multi - scale simulations provide a direct means to study the changes in structure and dynamics of the the protein aggregate under the force of the dna loop it creates .",
    "another application of multi - scale modeling could be to a system where several proteins bind to the same dna loop and alter the dna geometry at or near their binding sites .",
    "such systems arise during gene transcription , when multiple transcription factors and rna polymerase components bind at or near a gene promoter , during dna replication when helicases and gyrases concurrently alter the dna topology , inside eukaryotic chromatin with multiple nucleosomes clustering on long dna threads  @xcite .",
    "simulations of the separate protein - dna complexes could be run on atomic scale , and the stress imposed on the dna in one simulation could be passed to another via an elastic rod model of the dna segment(s ) connecting the different complexes .",
    "the binding of some proteins could even be mimicked with the intrinsic curvature and twist terms , as outlined above .",
    "finally , the local dna geometry predicted in our model can be used to replace the coarse - grained elastic ribbon with an all - atom dna structure in selected areas of the loop or even over the whole loop ( cf app .",
    "[ sec : appendixf ] ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lac_operon]c , d , where the all - atom structure was placed on top of the predicted 76  bp and 385  bp u loops .",
    "a local segment of the all - atom structure can be simulated with the forces and torques from the rest of the loop applied to its boundaries  using the same multi - scale simulation technique as outlined above .",
    "the segment can be simulated on its own , so as to compare the segment s structural dynamics in an unconstrained conformation , or inside the large bent loop . or , if the segment in question is a binding site of a certain protein , that protein could be docked to the dna segment , and the simulation of the two would allow one to study the changes in the protein binding to dna upon the loop formation . with the advent of the computational power ,",
    "even the simulations of the all - atom structures of moderately sized dna loops , such as the 76  bp loop studied here , would become possible .",
    "for such a simulation , the all - atom loop structure , predicted on the basis of the elastic loop model , can serve as a good starting point .",
    "naturally , before being used in such advanced simulations , the model has to be refined and extensively tested using all the available experimental data . in the present state",
    ", we have not even converged to a single preferred set of elastic moduli , as a whole family of values may account for the _ lac _ repressor  loop bending energies .",
    "refining and adjustment of the model parameters on the basis of other data is at this point imperative for making the suggested universal elastic model fully functional on all levels .",
    "such data can come from the experiments on dna interaction with other dna - binding proteins , including topoisomerases  @xcite , from the energetics of dna minicircles  @xcite , and from the analysis of deformations in dna x - ray structures , following the ideas of olson _ et al _",
    "@xcite .",
    "another necessary adjustment would have to account for the well - known sequence - specificity of dna properties  @xcite .",
    "the bending moduli have to be determined in the sequence - specific fashion , as functions of the arclength @xmath0 , varying according to the dna sequence at each point of the studied loop ( see app .",
    "[ sec : appendixd ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic curvatures @xmath109 and varying intrinsic twist @xmath110 are also known to have a significant effect on the structure and dynamics of some dna sequences  @xcite and parameterizing these functions is therefore also important for our model .    before the parameters are better defined , the model is still good for solving general problems , such as selection between alternative dna loop topologies or energy estimates within several kt , as discussed in the previous section , but not for more subtle quantitative predictions of the structural and energetical properties of dna loops .",
    "several extensions to the model may prove necessary in order to achieve realistic dna descriptions in certain cases .",
    "one obvious extension is including dna deformability into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] ) .",
    "dna is known to be a shearable and extensible molecule , as is evidenced by the deformations observed in the all - atom structures   or micromanipulation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the dna deformability can influence both the local and global structure of the modeled dna , especially in view of the observed coupling between the dna stretch and twist  @xcite . in order to include the dna deformability in our model , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] )  have to be modified as outlined in app .",
    "[ sec : appendixe ] , raising the order of the system ( [ eq : adv_grand_1]-[eq : adv_grand_11 ] )  to 16 .",
    "another vital modification consists in adding a steric repulsion parameter to the other force terms . in the present study ,",
    "there was no need for such a term because of its insignificance compared to the dna self - repulsion .",
    "however , if the dna interaction with a positively charged object ( e.g. , the histone core of the nucleosome ) is to be described , then the steric repulsion term becomes imperative lest the elastic solutions collapse on the positive charges , causing non - convergence of the iterative process .",
    "the steric repulsion can be described as the van der waals 6 - 12 potential and would not be qualitatively different from the electrostatic repulsion introduced in  . only the electric charges in eq .",
    "have to be replaced by the van der waals coefficients , the degrees of the denominators have to be changed to 6 or 12 , and the inverse screening radius has to be set to zero  otherwise , the forces of steric repulsion are computed in the same way and through the same iterative algorithm applied to solving the integro - differential equations .",
    "as for the electrostatic self - repulsion , its description in our model can be rendered more realistic by placing the phosphate charges on the outside of the double helix rather than on the centerline as in the present simplified treatment  . placing the phosphates at the points @xmath208 of the rod cross - section , where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are determined by the dna chemical structure ( fig .  [",
    "fig : elrod_dna ] ) , would result in replacing the radii @xmath11 in eq .",
    "by @xmath211 .",
    "that would make the electric field dependent not only on the radius - vector @xmath11 , but also on the the euler parameters @xmath212 that determine the orientation of the local coordinate frame .",
    "this additional dependence is unlikely to result in any algorithmic difficulties with solving the equations .",
    "physically , however , moving the phosphate charges away from the centerline means introducing external torques in each cross - section in additional to external forces , and the torques could change the calculated loop structure  again , unlikely in the general case , but possibly in the case of a close approach of the charged elastic ribbon to itself or any other charged object involved in the model .",
    "as has been noted above , the discussed modeling method produces static , zero - temperature structures of dna loops . yet",
    ", the entropic contribution to the free energy of different dna states may sometimes be important .",
    "interestingly , there is a way to estimate the structural entropy of a dna loop with our method .",
    "one could employ the intrinsic curvature / twist terms and perform statistical sampling by assigning bends and unwinding / overwinding with the energetic penalty between 0 and 1kt at random points of the loop , analyzing the resulting changes in the loop structure and energy .",
    "since the zero temperature structure of the loop is used as the starting point in the iterative calculations of the randomly bent and twisted structures , the iterations should converge much faster than those running from scratch .",
    "thus the ensemble of thermally excited structures can be generated and used to obtain the properties of the studied dna loop at a final temperature .",
    "the entropy of each looped state can be estimated , for example , through the volume of space swept by all the different structures from the thermal ensemble .    with the modifications , outlined above , the proposed model is likely to describe dna loops very realistically , yet still be less detailed and computationally much faster than all - atom models .",
    "one drawback , however , lies in the non - linear nature of the elastic problems .",
    "the solutions to the equations of elasticity are known to exhibit a non - trivial dependence on the problem parameters , for example , the boundary conditions . a latent response to the change of a certain condition can lead to an abrupt change in the shape of the bvp solution , for example , if the point of instability of the latter is achieved .",
    "if the solution changes too abruptly , the iterative procedure will fail due to non - convergence of the bvp solver .",
    "another reason for the non - convergence is meeting a bifurcation point , as it happened at low salt concentrations with the u@xmath130  and o@xmath130  solutions for the 385  bp loop ( sec .",
    "[ sec : electro_385 ] ) .",
    "such problems seem to be inherent to our method .",
    "if they are encountered , we would recommend to thoroughly analyze the nature of the non - convergence , for example , through monitoring the evolution of the intermediate solutions prior to the non - convergence . in the case of abrupt changes ,",
    "the ultimate structure can perhaps be guessed , or achieved along a different pathway with an equivalent endpoint that might not be leading the rod through the point of abrupt change ( for instance , rotating the end of the elastic rod counterclockwise by @xmath213 if a clockwise rotation by @xmath214 is causing problems ) . in the case of a bifurcation ,",
    "the bifurcating solutions branches need to be analyzed  which by itself may provide useful insights into the structural properties and transformations of the studied loop .      to conclude the paper , let us summarize what has been learned with our method about the specific system , the _ lac _ repressor  and its dna loop .",
    "for both possible lengths of the loop , it has been shown that the underwound loop structure pointing away from the _ lac _ repressor  should be predominant under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions , unless other biomolecules interfere .",
    "the predicted structure of the u loop depends only slightly on the salt concentration , although the loop energy exhibits a stronger dependence .",
    "the experimentally observed energy of the loop can be obtained with the right combination of parameters - which , of course , have to be extensively tested with other protein - dna systems .",
    "another reason why the predicted structure of the dna loop has to be treated with caution is the dynamic nature of the _ lac _ repressor - dna complex .",
    "the x - ray structure  @xcite , on which our conclusions were based , has been obtained without the dna loop connecting the protein - bound dna pieces and , therefore , can be presumably changed by the stress of the bent dna loop . yet",
    ", our results pave the way for analyzing these changes .",
    "the forces of the protein - dna interactions , computed with our model , can be applied in a multi - scale simulation of the _ lac _ repressor - dna complex , as described above .",
    "such simulation would reveal the equilibrium state of the _ lac _ repressor  with the bound dna loop , or at least show the spectrum of structural states visited by the protein during its dynamics with the attached loop .",
    "the results of such dynamics may even change our conclusions about the structure and energetics of the dna loops created by the _ lac _ repressor .",
    "when the boundary conditions change , the o loop can become energetically preferable to the u loop , or even one of the dismissed extraneous solutions may become feasible . yet , to make multi - scale simulations possible , that would study the complexes between _ lac _ repressor , or other proteins , and the dna loops in their dynamic nature , was the driving force behind the development of our coarse - grained dna model  which , per se , does not pretend to yield final conclusions about the _ lac _ repressor - dna complex .",
    "in conclusion , a universal theoretical model of dna loops has been presented .",
    "the model unifies several existing dna models and provides description of many physical properties of real dna : anisotropic flexibility , salt - dependent electrostatic self - repulsion , intrinsic twist and curvature  all the properties being sequence - dependent .",
    "the model is applicable to a broad range of problems regarding the interactions of dna - binding proteins with dna segments of moderate length ( 1001,000bp ) and can serve as a basis of all - atom or multi - scale simulations of protein - dna complexes .",
    "the application of the model to the _ lac _ repressor - dna complex revealed a likely structure of the 76  bp and 385  bp dna loops , created by the protein .",
