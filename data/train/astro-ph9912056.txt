    "detailed studies of the matter distribution in clusters of galaxies provide important clues on the growth of condensations and the evolution of the universe . from x - ray observations it is possible to derive both the gas and the total binding mass distributions , under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "optical data , i.e. galaxy photometry and redshifts , combined with x - ray observations allow to check the validity of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption and derive the spatial distribution of the dark matter .",
    "most analyses in the past ( @xcite ) were based on the further simplifying assumption that the gas is isothermal , at least within about 1 h@xmath4 mpc , possibly with the exclusion of a central cooling flow region ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the @xmath0-model ( @xcite ) which predicts that the dynamical parameter @xmath5 , representing the ratio between the energy per unit mass of galaxies and gas , equals the morphological parameter @xmath6 defined by the fit of the gas density distribution with a king profile .",
    "the observations show that on average @xmath7 ( @xcite ) . however bahcall and lubin ( 1994 ) ascribed this `` @xmath0-discrepancy '' to the underestimate of the slope of the galaxy density profile , appearing in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , rather than to a failure of the model . in their x - ray ",
    "optical analysis of a sample of abell clusters , cirimele , nesci , & trvese ( 1997 ) ( cnt ) found that @xmath8 in a wide range of densities , as predicted by the hydrostatic isothermal equilibrium .",
    "this allows to define , for each cluster , a morphological parameter @xmath9 , independent of any analytical representation of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath9 with @xmath12 supports the explanation of the `` @xmath0-discrepancy '' suggested by @xcite and the consistency of the `` @xmath0-model '' , at least for several galaxy clusters of regular and relaxed appearance .",
    "the gas and binding mass distributions thus derived provide a typical value of the baryon fraction @xmath13 , of the order of 0.2 within 1 - 2 h@xmath4 mpc ( @xcite , mohr et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this relatively high value , compared with the results of primordial nucleosynthesis calculation ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) implies that either the cosmological parameter is smaller than unity ( @xcite ) , or @xmath13 is not representative of the cosmic value , and galaxy clusters are surrounded by extended halos of non baryonic dark matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter hypothesis raises the problem of understanding the mechanisms of a large scale baryonic segregation .",
    "however , recently asca data have provided direct evidences of gas temperature gradients in the outer regions of several galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) . according to @xcite , in the outer regions",
    "some clusters show a polytropic index even greater than 5/3 , which is inconsistent with the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions . according to @xcite , a systematic difference between the electron and the proton temperatures",
    "can not explain the inconsistency , and a real departure from hydrostatic equilibrium must happen in some cases . even disregarding these extreme cases ,",
    "once the temperature profiles are available it is worth : i ) to check how far from the cluster center the hydrostatic condition can be assumed , specially if strong temperature gradients are present ; ii ) to estimate the correction to the total mass and baryon fraction implied by non - isothermality .",
    "moreover some clusters show an anomalously high value of the dynamical parameter @xmath12 , possibly suggesting deviations from the equilibrium conditions and requiring a detailed analysis of the velocity distribution .",
    "the galaxy cluster a  2319 has been extensively studied in the past , so that many galaxy redshifts are available , rosat pspc images can be retrieved from the public archive and a temperature profile based on asca data has been published by @xcite ( see however @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the present work",
    "we combine these data with the f band photometry of galaxies ( @xcite ) , and compare the gas and galaxy density distributions .",
    "we generalize the definition of the morphological parameter @xmath9 to verify the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions .",
    "the analysis suggests the consistency of the hydrostatic model in the presence of a temperature gradient .",
    "thus we discuss the mass distribution as obtained by adopting a polytropic model or a simple parabolic representation of the temperature profile , and we compare the resulting baryon fraction with the limits provided by the standard nucleosynthesis calculations , then deriving constraints on the large scale baryon segregation and the cosmological parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath15 .",
    "the galaxy cluster a  2319 has been studied by several authors in the radio , optical and x - ray bands .",
    "it is classified as a bm type ii - iii and as a richness 1 , rs - type cd cluster ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath161800 km s@xmath17 is particularly high .",
    "however , faber and dressler ( 1977 ) , on the basis of 31 galaxy spectra already suggested that a  2319 is actually two clusters nearly superimposed along the line of sight : the main component a  2319  a with an average redshift @xmath18=15882 and a velocity dispersion @xmath19 km s@xmath17 and the second component a  2319  b , located about @xmath20 nw with @xmath21=19074 and @xmath22 km s@xmath17 .",
    "more recently oegerle , hill , and fitchett ( 1995)(ohf ) measured several new redshifts , applied the `` @xmath23-test''of dressler and shectman ( 1988 ) to locate the a and b components , and assigned the 139 galaxies of known redshift to the component a and b ( or to the background / foreground ) on the basis of their position and redshift , empirically trying to keep gaussian the velocity distribution of a  2319  b. they found n@xmath24=100 and n@xmath25=28 galaxies in the two components with @xmath18=15727 km s@xmath17 , @xmath26=1324 km s@xmath17 @xmath21=18636 km s@xmath17 @xmath27=742 km s@xmath17 respectively .    to assign individual galaxies to the a and b components we adopted the results of ohf to obtained a first order estimate of the cluster positions , average radial velocities @xmath28 , and velocity dispersions @xmath29 , and we computed the relevant core radii @xmath30 of the two components , where i = a , b identifies the component .",
    "then we assumed the following probability distributions of galaxies respect to radial velocities v and projected distance b from the relevant cluster center :    @xmath31^{(1- \\beta_{(i)})}-1\\right)\\right\\}^{-1 } \\left [ 1+\\left(\\frac{b}{r_c^{(i)}}\\right)^2\\right]^{-\\beta_{(i ) } }    \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_i(v ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_{(i)}^2 } } \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{(v-\\bar{v}_{(i)})^2}{2\\sigma_{(i)}^2}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 the first order estimate of the number of galaxies of the relevant component , and the @xmath33 is the radius of the circle containing the @xmath34 observed galaxies .",
    "this simple parameterization is independent of any assumption about the distance along the line of sight of the two clusters and their relative motion . each galaxy",
    "is then assigned to the component of higher probability .",
    "the 99% confidence volumes are also considered for each cluster , and galaxies outside these volumes are assigned to the background or foreground .",
    "we obtain the new values n@xmath24=96 and n@xmath25=24 @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "since the resulting velocity distributions of the two components do not show strong deviation from gaussian distributions , the reported uncertainties @xmath39 and @xmath40 , on @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , have been computed as @xmath41 $ ]  i = a , b .",
    "the effect of membership uncertainty can be evaluated as follows .",
    "given a sample of n galaxies with average velocity @xmath42 and velocity dispersion @xmath43 , the addition of k galaxies with velocity @xmath44 produces a new velocity dispersion @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , to increase @xmath26 by more than @xmath46 it is necessary to include in the sample a more than k=2 galaxies with a recession velocity exceeding @xmath47 .",
    "although on the sole basis of the `` @xmath23 test '' there is a 10% probability that a2319b is not a physical association , the strong clustering of large @xmath23 values in a region ( see ohf fig.5 ) corresponding to enhanced x - ray emission suggest that it is a physical entity .",
    "moreover , the analysis of bound orbits of the two components a  2319  a and a  2319  b led @xcite to the conclusion that `` there is a reasonably high probability that these clusters are not bound and will never merge '' .",
    "the latter conclusion is supported by the discussion of fgb who compare the x - ray images with simulations of cluster collisions ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the above considerations suggest and legitimate the assumption , adopted in the following , that the two clusters are separate entities .",
    "we have added to the spectroscopic information the f band photometry of a  2319 , obtained by @xcite from microdensitometric scans of a palomar 48 inch schmidt plates , as part of a systematic study of the morphology and luminosity functions of galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "due to the low galactic latitude ( b@xmath48 ) the field of a  2319 is very crowded and the automatic star / galaxy classification is difficult .",
    "thus we have revised the classification and recovered some misclassified object .    to focus our attention on the main component a , we reduced the effect of the b component excluding from our sample all the galaxies classified as b ( or background / foreground ) .",
    "we adopted a fixed center @xmath49 , derived from the centroid of x - ray emission as computed in a small ( 2 arcmin ) circle around the intensity peak .",
    "this point is identified with the center of a spherical structure which we assume to represent the a component .",
    "we chose a magnitude limit @xmath50=16.33 mag and the resulting fraction of galaxies without measured redshift is 0.23 .",
    "thus , the fraction of galaxies without measured redshift and belonging to the b component is of the order @xmath51 , i.e. 4% , and is not expected to affect significantly the galaxy density profile .",
    "we fitted with a maximum likelihood algorithm the unbinned galaxy distribution using both a king profile @xmath52 and with a de vaucouleurs profile @xmath53 , where the background counts @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath0 are free parameters , while @xmath58 is determined by the normalization to the total number of observed galaxies and @xmath59 is the projected distance from the cluster center .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test has been applied in both cases and the results are reported in table 1 , where the errors reported represent one - sigma uncertainties derived from monte carlo simulations described in section 4 , and @xmath60 is the probability of the null hypothesis that deviations larger than d are produced by random noise .    the surface density and",
    "the fitting profiles are shown in figure 1 .",
    "in this case the king profile has a slightly higher probability and will be adopted in the following to derive the volume distribution by numerical inversion .",
    "however , the differences between the two fitting curves , specially for @xmath61 , can not affect significantly the subsequent discussion of the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions .    to obtain the total luminosity of the cluster , @xmath62",
    ", we fitted with a @xcite function the unbinned luminosity distribution excluding the brightest member , using a maximum likelihood algorithm , adopting a constant @xmath63 and @xmath64 as a free parameter , as in @xcite .",
    "this gives : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is expressed in units of @xmath67 , @xmath68 in @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the limiting luminosity corresponding to the magnitude limit ( @xmath71 mag ) of the galaxy sample adopted to derive @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath64 changes by less than 1% considering a sample which includes the galaxies of a  2319  b. the galaxy mass @xmath72 is then obtained from the total luminosity assuming an average mass - to - light ratio @xmath73 from @xcite , adopting @xmath74 for bright ellipticals ( see @xcite ) and computing @xmath75 from the relation v - f=0.40 ( b - v ) ( @xcite ) .    to estimate the virial mass we have evaluated the r.m.s .",
    "velocity dispersion @xmath76 in four concentric rings each containing 1/4 of the galaxies of known redshift of a  2319  a. the four values are 1148 km s@xmath17 , 1415 km s@xmath17 , 1327 km s@xmath17 , 1193 km s@xmath17 with a r.m.s uncertainty of about 200 km s@xmath17 .",
    "thus in the following we assume a constant dispersion , derived from the entire a  2319  a sample , @xmath77 km s@xmath17    the resulting virial mass @xmath78 is @xmath79 , namely only 2% less than the value given by ohf , since the decrease of @xmath80 is almost entirely compensated by a slight increase of the projected virial radius @xmath81 ( @xcite ) , which in our case is @xmath82 mpc .",
    "from the rosat public archive we extracted the available position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) images corresponding to two observations of a  2319 , on march 1991 and november 1992 , which cover a 128x128 arcmin@xmath83 field with pixel size of 15x15 arcsec@xmath83 and an effective resolution of about @xmath84 fwhm , in the energy band 0.5 - 2.0 kev . the exposure maps ( @xcite ) , providing the effective exposure time of each pixel , are also available at the rosat public archive for each observation .",
    "we divided each image for the relevant exposure map and combined the two images with weights proportional to the maxima of the exposure map ( 1514.6 s and 3200.8 s respectively ) .",
    "the resulting image is shown in figure 2 .",
    "feretti , giovannini & bhringer ( 1997 ) ( fgb ) discuss the radio structure of a2319 , which shows a powerful radio halo .",
    "they also analyze two substructural features in the x - rays , one corresponds to the e - w elongation in the very center of the a component , detected in the image obtained with the rosat high resolution imager , and is interpreted by fgb as an evidence of a recent merging process , likely providing the energy for the radio halo .",
    "this feature is confined within the inner 5 arcmin and does not affect the analysis of the hydrostatic equilibrium , particularly in the region where the temperature is not constant , i.e. for @xmath85 arcmin . in the outer region the cluster structure is rather regular , as for most cd clusters , except for an elongation in the direction of the b component . according to fgb , the b component is in a pre - merger state and has not yet proceed far enough to disturb the bulk of the gas , as can be argued from a comparison with the cluster collision simulation by @xcite .",
    "thus we analyzed a  2319  a as a separate entity , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "as a first approximation we ignored the presence of the b component , we assumed spherical symmetry and , as in cnt , we derived the volume density @xmath86 of the gas by both numerical inversion of the projection equation , and by fitting the observed surface brightness with a `` @xmath0-model '' ( @xcite ) @xmath87^{-3\\beta + 1/2}+i_b$ ] , obtaining consistent results .",
    "the results are also consistent with fgb and with a more recent analysis of @xcite",
    ". then we applied the same procedure after the exclusion of the northern half ( @xmath88 ) of the image , to eliminate the effect of the b component .",
    "we have evaluated the constant background value @xmath89 cts s@xmath17 arcmin@xmath90 in the region @xmath91 mpc .",
    "the fitting parameters are reported in table 2 , together with the central proton density @xmath92 .",
    "the one - sigma uncertainties have been evaluated by monte carlo simulations , described in section 4 .",
    "the central proton density is obtained from the relation : @xmath93^{-3\\beta + 1/2}=   em \\cdot \\int_{\\nu_{min}}^{\\nu_{max } } \\lambda(\\nu , t ) d \\nu\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the rest - frame cooling function corrected for the cosmological dimming factor @xmath95 and computed with the code of @xcite with 0.3 solar abundance corresponding to @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 define the observing band in the rest - frame and @xmath99   ( see @xcite ) , and correction for absorption with @xmath100 ( @xcite ) has been applied to @xmath101 .    again",
    "our results are consistent with the analysis of fgb .",
    "in particular we also find a smaller value of the core radius @xmath57 of the a component when the northern half is excluded to reduce the effect the b component .",
    "the observed surface brightness profile and the fitting @xmath0-model are shown in figure 3 .",
    "for consistency with the optical analysis , where we eliminated the galaxies assigned to the b component , in the following we adopt the fit obtained after the exclusion of the northern half of the cluster image .",
    "the corresponding gas density profile @xmath102^{-3\\beta/2}$ ] is obtained assuming a constant temperature equal to the emission - weighted temperature @xmath103 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the non - isothermality does not significantly affect the results ( @xcite ) , due to the weak dependence of the emissivity on temperature , in the adopted band ( see next section ) .",
    "the gas density profile has been computed also by a non parametric numerical deprojection as in cnt , obtaining consistent results .",
    "as pointed out in cnt , it is possible to check the hydrostatic equilibrium condition in a non - parametric way , by a direct comparison of the density profiles of gas and galaxies . assuming spherical symmetry , the equilibrium condition implies ( @xcite ) : @xmath104 where @xmath76 is the radial galaxy velocity dispersion , @xmath105 measures the anisotropy of the velocity distribution and @xmath106 is the average molecular weight which we assume equal to 0.58 ( @xcite ) . for constant @xmath76 and @xmath107 , and @xmath108",
    ", this implies @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a constant representing the ratio between the energy per unit mass in the galaxies and the gas respectively ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "it is possible to define the morphological parameter @xmath111 to be compared with @xmath12 which is obtained from the spectroscopic observation of galaxies and the gas temperature derived from x - ray spectra . as already discussed in cnt , the very existence of a wide range of densities where @xmath9 is constant supports , in many cases , the validity of the isothermal model .",
    "however in the presence of a temperature gradient , as in the case of a  2319  a , both @xmath12 and @xmath9 depend on radius and the equilibrium equation reads : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and we still assume that the galaxy velocity distribution is isotropic and @xmath76 is constant . to check the validity of equation  [ bb ] we used the temperatures obtained by @xcite .",
    "we computed @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath114 at three projected radii of 4 , 10 and 20 arcmin , corresponding to the boundaries of the four rings whose temperatures are given by @xcite . with the constant velocity dispersion @xmath115 km s@xmath17 derived in section 2 , @xmath12 ranges from 0.86 @xmath116 0.15 in the first point , to 1.52@xmath116 0.47 in the outermost point , i.e. the ratio between the energy per unit mass in gas and galaxies is close to unity within a central isothermal region of about 0.5 h@xmath4 mpc , while it decreases in the outer regions .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath117 , obtained by numerical deprojection , versus @xmath118 . from the slope of the curve",
    "is possible to derive a value of @xmath119 at each radius .",
    "the values of @xmath119 range from @xmath120 in the first ring , to @xmath121 in the outermost ring .",
    "the one - sigma uncertainties are evaluated from monte carlo simulations described below .",
    "we also computed @xmath122 , which is close to zero in the cluster center and increases up to 0.58@xmath123 at r@xmath1241 h@xmath4 mpc .",
    "the one - sigma uncertainties are derived from errors on the temperature values reported in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath125 as a function of the rhs of equation  [ bb ] , ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "we stress that the relation between the two quantities on the x and y axes is not automatically implied by their definition , since the galaxy density @xmath127 only appears in the rhs and is observationally independent of the quantities in the lhs .",
    "the value of @xmath125 is slightly larger than @xmath126 .",
    "this could indicate that @xmath43 is still slightly overestimated due to the presence of the background component a  2319  b. however the intrinsic statistical uncertainty does not allow this level of accuracy .",
    "furthermore , even small deviation from the spherical symmetry , or from isotropy of the velocity distribution , could have comparable effects .",
    "all we can safely say is that there is an increase of @xmath12 versus ( @xmath126 ) , which is consistent with a straight line of unit slope .",
    "thus , within the present uncertainties the data are consistent with equation [ bb ] , namely with validity of the hydrostatic equilibrium , also in the outer region of the cluster where the temperature declines .",
    "the accuracy of this type of check , as applied to a single cluster , is limited by various factors .",
    "although future x - ray data will provide much higher signal - to - noise , the uncertainty on galaxy density profile is intrinsically limited by poisson noise on galaxy counts . moreover subclustering and unknowable deviations from spherical symmetry",
    "will always produce an uncertainty on the galaxy density deprojection .",
    "nevertheless , the systematic application of the method described , to all the cluster with measured temperature distribution ( @xcite ) will likely provide statistical indication on the validity of , or the deviation from , the equilibrium conditions in the outer parts of galaxy clusters .    assuming that our results indicate the validity of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", we can derive the distribution of the total binding mass @xmath128 of a2319a : @xmath129    the slopes of the temperature profiles are crucial in establishing whether the non - isothermality causes an increase or decrease of the mass estimate , with respect to the isothermal @xmath0-model .",
    "in fact , from equation  [ mtot ] , indicating with @xmath130 the mass derived by an isothermal @xmath0-model with temperature @xmath131 the fractional change in the mass estimate is : @xmath132 where the two terms on the r.h.s . of the equation",
    "can be of the same order .      where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the emissivity of the gas , integrated in the adopted band .",
    "we can fit the temperature profile of a  2319 provided by @xcite , neglecting the effect of projection and adopting @xmath138 , to determine the polytropic index @xmath134 .",
    "notice that , due to small value of @xmath139 , the result is not significantly different if we simply assume @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the above expressions .",
    "the slope @xmath142 of the temperature profile reaches a maximum at @xmath143 and progressively decreases in the outer regions .    as a result , for @xmath144 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath145 is positive only for @xmath146 .",
    "this limit decreases for increasing @xmath0 and @xmath134 , e.g. @xmath147 for @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , while @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "we stress that @xmath145 is always negative at large radii , and this implies an enhancement of the `` baryon catastrophe '' .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath154 and the resulting temperature profile is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the quality of the fit is quite poor , and there is a probability of 91% that the deviations are non random .",
    "the increment of the mass in the central region , with respect to isothermal model , and the enhancement of the baryonic catastrophe obtained with a polytropic model are a mere artifact of the particular shape of the polytropic temperature profile , which is not a good representation of the data , at least in the case of a  2319  a.    more specifically , the data seem to indicate an almost isothermal central region and an increasing slope of the temperature profile for increasing radius .",
    "this behavior is consistent with a change of the polytropic index with radius from an isothermal ( @xmath153 ) towards an adiabatic ( @xmath149 ) hydrostatic equilibrium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a fit with the law @xmath155 is shown in figure 6 . in this case",
    "the probability is p(@xmath156)=0.99 .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath130 , corresponding to the isothermal model , and @xmath157 as obtained with both the polytropic model and the quadratic interpolation of the temperature profile . on the basis of the above discussion we assume the latter as the best representation of the mass distribution .    in the same figure , galaxy and gas masses , @xmath72 and @xmath158 are also shown .",
    "the latter is computed both in the isothermal approximation and using the temperature profile : the result is only weakly dependent on the temperature changes .",
    "@xmath158 is steeper than @xmath72 and @xmath157 , which have more similar slopes . as a consequence the gas mass dominates over the galaxy mass at large radii .",
    "these results are consistent with previous findings of cnt .",
    "the statistical uncertainties have been evaluated by monte carlo simulations of the entire reduction process . for the x - ray data , starting from a `` @xmath0-model '' corresponding to the fitting parameters",
    ", we generated 500 random sets representing the photon counts in each radial ring with poisson noise , and we extracted 500 random background values , with a standard deviation estimated from intensity fluctuation of the surface brightness outside @xmath159 mpc where the background value has been measured .",
    "then we fitted with a `` @xmath0-model '' each intensity profile , obtaining the statistical distribution of the fitting parameters .",
    "finally we extracted 500 values of the temperature in each of the four rings corresponding to the data of @xcite , with the relevant standard deviations , and we fitted the temperature profile with a parabolic law .",
    "then we applied to the simulated data the same algorithms applied to real data for the evaluation of the mass profiles .",
    "this procedure allows to define a one - sigma confidence interval for the gas mass @xmath160 and for the total mass @xmath161 as a function of radius .",
    "a similar procedure was adopted for the galaxy distribution .",
    "then we extracted , for each cluster simulation , a random value of @xmath162 from a gaussian distribution with a mean value and a standard deviation corresponding obtained from @xcite .",
    "the one - sigma confidence intervals are reported as shaded areas in figure 7 .",
    "we define the luminous mass as the sum of the gas mass and the galaxy mass as deduced using an average stellar mass - to - light ratio ( see section 2 ) : @xmath163 .",
    "the above results imply that the dark matter @xmath164 has a distribution similar to @xmath72 .",
    "this provides a constraint on the mechanism of galaxy and cluster formation .",
    "since an unknown fraction of the dark matter is baryonic , @xmath165 represents a lower limit on the baryon fraction @xmath166 .",

    "we have performed a new analysis of the abell cluster a  2319 , and assigned the individual galaxies to the a  2319  a and a  2319  b components by an objective criterion taking into account both position and redshift .",

    "since , according to @xcite , a  2319  a shows a radial gas temperature decrease , we have generalized the method introduced by cirimele , nesci & trvese ( 1997 ) cnt , in order to check the validity of the hydrostatic equilibrium in the case of a non isothermal gas .",
    "we have derived the total mass profile @xmath157 through the non isothermal hydrostatic equation adding new evidence in favor of the results of cnt that the total mass and the galaxy mass have similar radial distributions , more concentrated with respect to the gas component .",
    "polytropic models imply smaller masses at large radii , respect to the isothermal model , i.e. a higher value of the baryon fraction .",
    "thus , the use of a polytropic model would enhance the baryon catastrophe .",
    "however we have shown that the polytropic model is inconsistent with the observed temperature profile , at least in the specific case of a 2319 a. a parabolic representation of the temperature profile gives , instead , a total mass larger than computed in the isothermal approximation , mitigating the baryon catastrophe .    in any case , @xmath166 is larger than @xmath179 , resulting from nucleosynthesis calculations and recent measures of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio ( d / h ) , in high resolution studies of the @xmath181 forest ( @xcite ) . under the assumption that the value of @xmath182 , found for a 2319 a , which is consistent with other estimates ( @xcite , cnt , @xcite , mohr et al . , 1999 )",
    "is typical of galaxy clusters , it is possible to derive the following conclusions . if the @xmath183 assumption is kept , then the baryonic fraction within galaxy clusters is not representative of the cosmic value and clusters must be surrounded by dark matter halos ( @xcite ) . if , on the other hand , beyond @xmath184 mpc the material has not yet fallen into the cluster , as infall models indicate , then @xmath166 is representative of the cosmic value and the cosmological parameter must be @xmath185 ( @xcite and refs . therein ) , i.e. in our case @xmath186 , where the uncertainty on the latter value depends on the intrinsic spread of the baryon fraction , in the presently observable volumes around galaxy clusters",
    ".    recently markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have collected temperature profiles for 30 galaxy clusters based on asca observations .",
    "however , only a minority of clusters is regular enough , specially in the outer regions , to allow an x - ray and optical check of the equilibrium conditions as suggested in the present paper .",
    "this limits the accuracy and the reliability of a `` measure '' of the cosmological parameter @xmath14 , based on a comparison between the baryon fraction @xmath166 and @xmath2 .",
    "moreover future cosmic microwave background experiments are expected to provide tighter constraints on @xmath14 ( @xcite ) as compared with the results derived from the analysis of the matter distribution in galaxy clusters .    on the basis of this new estimate of @xmath14 ,",
    "once the equilibrium conditions of the non - isothermal regions are verified by the systematic application of the analysis outlined in the present paper , it will be possible to extend the ( otherwise questionable ) estimates of the general distribution of luminous and dark matter based on the hydrostatic model , to the outer regions of galaxy clusters of a statistical sample , thus providing new constraints for the models of cluster formation an the physics of large scale baryon segregation .",
