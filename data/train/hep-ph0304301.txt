    "it appears that in the next decade the photon - nucleus interactions will be in the forefront of the small _ x _ qcd dynamics studies .",
    "this is due to the possibilities of the studying coherent ( and for some channels incoherent ) photon - nucleus interactions at energies which exceed at least by a factor of 10 the energies of electron - nucleon interactions at hera .",
    "such studies will be feasible at lhc within the program of the study of the ultra peripheral collisions ( upc ) @xcite .",
    "this opens a challenging opportunity to get answers to a number of the fundamental questions which could be investigated in the coherent processes : how to achieve new qcd regime of strong interaction with small coupling constant , how interactions depend on the type of the projectile and how they change with an increase of the size / thickness of the target , etc .",
    "several regimes appear possible depending on the incident energy and the target thickness . a hadronic projectile ( proton , pion , etc ) high - energy interactions with the nucleus rather rapidly approach the black body limit ( bbl ) in which the total cross section of the interaction is equal to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "another extreme limit is the interaction of small size projectiles ( or wave packages ) . in this case in a wide range of high energies the system remains almost frozen during the passage through the nucleus and the regime of color transparency is reached in which the interaction of the small size projectile with a nucleus is rather weak and proportional to a. this color transparency phenomenon in hard high energy projectile - nucleus interactions has been recently observed experimentally in the exclusive production of two jets by pions in the coherent diffraction off nuclei . at higher energies interactions of small dipole is expected to reach the regime of the perturbative color opacity . in this regime",
    "the small size projectile still couples to the gluon field of the target via the ( skewed ) gluon density of the target , @xmath7 , like in the color transparency regime .",
    "however , the scattering amplitude is not @xmath8 due to the leading twist ( lt ) shadowing , @xmath9 .",
    "the onset of gluon shadowing tames somewhat the increase of @xmath10 between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and slows down the increase of the small dipole - nucleus interaction with energy .",
    "the resulting taming is not strong enough to prevent the leading twist approximation result for the total inelastic cross section from reaching and even exceeding the bbl .",
    "this violation of unitarity is an unambiguous signal that for sufficiently small @xmath3 the lt approximation breaks down .",
    "an important practical issue for the studies of the small @xmath3 dynamics is whether the interactions of small dipoles with several nucleons of the target are strongly modified by the leading twist shadowing dynamics @xcite or one can neglect the lt gluon shadowing , like in the model of mclerran and venugopalan@xcite , and focus on the higher twist effects which are often modeled in the impact parameter space eikonal model @xcite .",
    "if the leading twist shadowing was small and only higher twist effects were taming the increase of the dipole - nucleus cross section , the break down of the dglap approximation would occur at rather large @xmath3 .",
    "the break down of dglap may result in onset of the bbl or taming of the cross sections at smaller values .",
    "we will argue below that the relative importance of leading and higher twist interactions could be experimentally resolved using coherent onium photoproduction .",
    "note also that if the lt gluon shadowing effects were small enough , the bbl for the interaction of @xmath13 dipoles of the size @xmath14 could be reached for central collisions with heavy nuclei already at @xmath15 that is in the kinematics where @xmath16 effects in the evolution of the parton densities are small . in any case , whatever is the limiting behavior for the interaction of the small size dipoles with heavy nuclei , it is of major theoretical interest since it represents a new regime of interactions when the leading twist approximation and therefore the whole notion of the parton distributions becomes inapplicable for the description of hard qcd processes in the small @xmath17 regime .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that on the top of providing higher parton density targets , nuclei have another important advantage as compared to the nucleon target .",
    "it is a weak dependence of the scattering amplitude on the impact parameter for a wide range of the impact parameters ( in fact , one can combine light and heavy nuclei to study the dependence of the amplitudes on the nuclear thickness ) . on the contrary , in the nucleon case",
    "the scattering at large impact parameters is important even at very small @xmath3 working to mask the change of the regime of the interactions at small impact parameters .",
    "theoretical studies of the limiting behavior of the small dipole - heavy nucleus cross sections did not lead so far to definitive results .",
    "it is conceivable that the qcd dynamics will stop the increase of the cross section at central impact parameters at the values significantly smaller than allowed by the bbl . in the following discussion to emphasize the qualitative difference of the new regime we will use for simplicity the extreme hypothesis that the impact factor at small impact parameters reaches the value of one corresponding to the bbl pattern of the elastic and inelastic cross sections being equal .",
    "there exist many processes where the projectile wave function is a superposition of configurations of different sizes , leading to the fluctuations of the interaction strength . in this respect ,",
    "interactions of real and virtual photons with heavy nuclei provide unique opportunities since the photon wave function contains both the hadron - like configurations ( vector meson dominance ) and the direct photon configurations ( small @xmath13 components , heavy quark - antiquark components ) .",
    "the important advantage of the photon is that at high energies the bbl is manifested in diffraction into a multitude of the hadronic final states ( elastic diffraction @xmath18 is negligible ) while in the hadron case only elastic diffraction survives in the bbl , and details of the dynamics responsible for this regime remain hidden .",
    "moreover , one can _ post - select _ a small size or a large size initial state by selecting a particular final state , containing for example @xmath19 @xmath20 , or a leading light meson .",
    "such post - selection is much easier in the photon case than in the hadron case since the distribution over the sizes of the configurations is much broader in the photon case .",
    "spectacular manifestations of bbl in ( virtual ) photon diffraction include strong enhancement of the large mass tail of the diffractive spectrum as compared to the expectations of the triple pomeron limit , large cross section of the high @xmath21 dijet production @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the study of the diffractive channels will allow to distinguish between two extreme scenarios : large suppression of the cross section due to the leading twist shadowing and nonlinear regime of the bbl .",
    "investigation of the coherent diffraction in bbl would allow to perform unique measurements of various components of the light cone wave function of the photon , providing a much more detailed information than similar measurements in the regime where leading twist dominates .    in this review",
    "we summarize our recent studies of the various regimes of the coherent photoproduction off nuclei @xcite : the onset of the bbl regime , phenomenon of color transparency and perturbative color opacity related to the leading twist nuclear gluon shadowing , and the pattern of soft qcd phenomena in the proximity to the black body limit .",
    "in addition we consider hard leading twist diffraction off nuclei in dis .",
    "we also outline how these effects can be studied in upc collisions and provide a comparison with the first upc data from rhic .",
    "our consideration of the coherent photoproduction processes of light flavor and hidden charm is based on the use of the eikonal approximation that is the glauber model modified to take into account finite longitudinal momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the photoproduction cross section @xmath22 is given in the glauber model by the general expression @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the photon energy , @xmath25is the vector meson momentum , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the longitudinal momentum transfer in the @xmath28 transition , and @xmath29 is the diffractive nuclear profile function .",
    "depending on the considered vector meson production process , the glauber approach can be combined with either the traditional vector dominance model ( vdm ) ( for the detailed review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or with the generalized vector dominance model ( gvdm ) @xcite . more properly",
    "this latter approximation should be called the gribov - glauber model @xcite because the space - time evolution of high energy processes is different in quantum mechanical models and in quantum field theory , and therefore theoretical foundations of the high - energy model are different . in particular , in qcd in difference from quantum mechanics a high - energy projectile interacts with all nucleons at the same impact parameter almost at the same time @xcite . due to the cancellations between diagonal and nondiagonal transitions",
    "the gvdm allows to take into account the qcd effect of the suppression of interaction of spatially small quark - gluon wave packages with a hadron target - the so called color transparency phenomenon .",
    "namely , cancellations occur between the amplitudes of the photon transition into a vector state @xmath30 with subsequent conversion to a state @xmath31 and direct production of the state @xmath31 , etc .",
    "the importance of the nondiagonal transitions reveals itself in the precocious bjorken scaling for moderately small @xmath32 as due to the presence in the virtual photon of hadron - like and point - like type configurations @xcite .",
    "these amplitudes are also crucial for ensuring a quantitative matching with perturbative qcd regime for @xmath33  few gev@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the vector meson production off a nucleon can be written within the gvdm as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are expressed through @xmath37 .",
    "calculation of the vector meson production amplitude off nuclei within the glauber approximation requires taking into account both the nondiagonal transitions due to the transition of the photon to a different meson @xmath38 in the vertex @xmath39 and due to a change of the meson in multiple rescatterings like @xmath40 .",
    "this physics is equivalent to inelastic shadowing phenomenon familiar from hadron - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "then in the optical limit ( @xmath41 ) of the glauber multistep production theory one can introduce the eikonal functions , @xmath42 , which describe propagation of the produced objects through the medium and are related to the diffractive profile function by expression @xmath43 within the optical limit of the glauber based gvdm with accuracy @xmath44 the eikonal functions @xmath42 are determined by the solutions of the coupled channel equations @xmath45 , \\label{cch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath46 .",
    "the exponential factors @xmath47 $ ] are responsible for the coherent length effect , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the generalized glauber -based optical potentials in the short - range approximation are given by the expression @xmath50 here @xmath51 are the forward elementary amplitudes , and @xmath52 is the nuclear density normalized by the condition @xmath53 .",
    "we calculated @xmath54 in the hartree - fock - skyrme ( hfs ) model which provided a very good(with an accuracy @xmath55 ) description of the global nuclear properties of spherical nuclei along the periodical table from carbon to uranium@xcite and the shell momentum distributions in the high energy ( p,2p)@xcite and ( e , ep)@xcite reactions .",
    "if the nondiagonal rescattering amplitudes @xmath56 , one can easily integrate eq.[cch ] , and using the expression for the elementary amplitude @xmath57 obtain the expression for the photoproduction cross section : @xmath58 well known from early seventies ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the gvdm to describe coherent photoproduction of hadronic states of @xmath59 gev off nuclei and consider the onset of bbl in the soft regime . in ref .",
    "@xcite the simplest nondiagonal model was considered with two states @xmath0 and @xmath60 .",
    "then the gvdm comprises elementary amplitudes @xmath61    it was assumed that both @xmath0 and @xmath62 have the same diagonal amplitudes of scattering off a nucleon .",
    "the ratio of coupling constants was fixed : @xmath63 , while the ratio of the nondiagonal and diagonal amplitudes @xmath64 , and the value @xmath65 were found from the fit to the forward @xmath66 cross sections measured at @xmath676.1 , 6.6 and 8.8 gev@xcite .",
    "one should emphasize here that in such gvdm extension @xmath60-meson approximates the hadron production in the interval of hadron masses @xmath68 .",
    "thus the values of the production cross section refer to the corresponding mass interval .",
    "we refined this model in @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the nuclear structure parameters was diminished by calculating the nuclear densities in the hartree - fock - skyrme ( hfs ) approach .",
    "next , we used in all our calculations the parameterization of  @xcite for the @xmath69 amplitude which was obtained from the fit to the experimental data on photoproduction off the proton target .",
    "the value of @xmath70 was fixed at 0.18 to ensure the best fit of the measured differential cross section of the @xmath0-meson photoproduction off lead at @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "note that this value of @xmath74 leads to a suppression of the differential cross section of the @xmath0-photoproduction in @xmath75 by a factor of @xmath76 practically coinciding with phenomenological renormalization factor @xmath77 introduced in @xcite to achieve the best fit of the elementary @xmath0-meson photoproduction forward cross section in the vdm which neglects mixing effects . with all parameters fixed we calculated the differential cross sections of @xmath0-production off nuclei and found a good agreement with the data @xcite , see a detailed comparison in @xcite . in view of a good agreement of the model with the data on @xmath0-meson production in the low energy domain we used this model to consider the @xmath0-meson photoproduction at higher energies of photons .",
    "the increase of the coherence length with the photon energy leads to a qualitative difference in the energy dependence of the coherent vector meson production off light and heavy nuclei and to a change of the a - dependence for the ratio of the forward @xmath60 and @xmath0-meson production cross sections between @xmath78 gev and @xmath79 gev ( fig.[rhoen ] ) .",
    "the observed pattern reflects the difference of the coherence lengths of the @xmath0-meson and a heavier @xmath80-meson which is important for the intermediate photon energies @xmath81 gev .",
    "the corrections due to nondiagonal transitions are relatively small ( @xmath82 15% ) for the case of @xmath0 production off a nuclei . as a result",
    ", we find that the gvdm cross section is close to the one calculated in the vdm for heavy nuclei as well .",
    "situation for @xmath60 production is much more interesting .",
    "the cross section of @xmath60 production off a nucleon is strongly suppressed as compared to the case when the @xmath83 transitions are switched off .",
    "the extra suppression factor is @xmath84 .",
    "the non - diagonal transitions disappear in the limit of large a ( corresponding to the bbl ) due to the condition of orthogonality of hadronic wave functions in accordance with the general argument of gribov @xcite . therefore in the limit of @xmath85",
    "we expect that the relation @xmath86 should be fulfilled for the productions of states @xmath87 of invariant masses @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "indeed we have found from calculations that in the case of the coherent photoproduction off lead the nondiagonal transitions becomes strongly suppressed with increase of the photon energy . as a result the @xmath90 ratio increases , exceeds the ratio of the @xmath91 forward cross sections calculated with accounting for @xmath92 transitions already at @xmath93 gev and becomes close to the value of @xmath94 which can be considered as the limit when one can treat the interaction with the heavy nucleus as a black one .",
    "it is worth noting here that presence of nondiagonal transitions in terms of the formalism of the scattering eigen states @xcite corresponds to the fluctuations of the values of the interaction cross sections for the real photon .",
    "the gvdm discussed in the paper leads to small ( @xmath95 ) color transparency effects at intermediate energies for the cross section of semiinclusive photoproduction processes .",
    "really , this model corresponds to the propagation of states with cross sections : @xmath96 . in the case of electroproduction @xmath74",
    "should be significantly larger : @xmath97 this equation follows from eq.([gvdm ] ) where the left hand side is put to zero because the cross section of the elastic vector meson electroproduction rapidly decreases with @xmath98 .",
    "the presence of the ct phenomenon within the gvdm leads to a substantial modification of the pattern of the approach to bbl .",
    "the nondiagonal transitions become more important with the increase of @xmath98 , leading to an enhancement of the effects discussed above . in particular",
    ", the fluctuations of strengths of interaction would lead at large @xmath98 to the color transparency phenomenon .",
    "presence in gvdm of significantly different masses of @xmath99 makes it impossible to describe all fluctuations of strengths of interaction in terms of one coherent length .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between gvdm description of the light meson production described above and production of charmonium states . in the case of the photoproduction of light mesons the soft physics dominates both at low and high energies",
    "hence , the gribov - glauber model should be applicable in a wide range of energies . at the same time the space - time picture of the process changes with energy . at low energies",
    "the meson is formed at the distances smaller than the typical interaction length of a meson in the nucleus . with the increase of energy",
    "the formation length starts to exceed the nuclear size and a photon converts to a system of @xmath13 and higher fock - components before the target , and one has to account for the interactions of this system with the media and subsequent transition of the system to a vector meson .    the situation is much more involved in the case of ( charm)onium production . at high energies",
    "both the coherence length @xmath101 and the formation length @xmath102}^{-1}$ ] ( distance on which the squeezed @xmath13 pair transforms into the ordinary meson ) are large and the color transparency phenomenon reveals itself .",
    "in particular , it explains the fast increase of the cross section with energy observed at hera ( for reviews of small x phenomena see ref .",
    "consequently , the value of the cross section extracted from the charmonium photoproduction characterizes the interaction of the squeezed @xmath19 pair with a nucleon rather than the charmonium - nucleon interaction . in the high energy limit the very small interquark distances in the wave function of the photon dominate , and",
    "one has to treat the interaction of small dipoles with nuclei . in this case",
    "the eikonal approximation gives a qualitatively wrong answer since it does not take into account the leading twist effect of the gluon shadowing(see the detailed analysis in  @xcite ) , while the leading twist analysis predicts large shadowing effects  @xcite , see discussion in section 3 . on the other hand , at the intermediate energies when onium states are formed inside the nucleus the nonperturbative effects at a transverse distance scale comparable to the charmonium size becomes important .",
    "the hadronic basis description would be more relevant in this case .",
    "however the vdm which takes into account only diagonal vector meson transitions does not account properly for the basic qcd dynamics of interaction .",
    "in particular , slac data  @xcite show that @xmath103 which within vdm corresponds to : @xmath104 .",
    "this conclusion is in evident contradiction with the qcd expectation that the hadron interaction cross section should be scaled approximately as the transverse area occupied by color : @xmath105 .",
    "thus in this naive qcd picture @xmath106 .",
    "a qcd explanation of such failure of vdm is based on the observation @xcite that in photoproduction of both the @xmath107and @xmath108mesons the small relative distances @xmath109 dominate in the @xmath19 component of the photon wave function .",
    "therefore the cross sections which enter into the ratio of @xmath107and @xmath108yields are cross sections of the interaction of the small dipoles , not genuine mesons .",
    "the suppression of the production of @xmath108 in this picture is primarily due to a smaller leptonic decay width of @xmath108(a factor of 1/3 ) .",
    "a significant additional suppression comes from importance of more massive @xmath19 intermediate states in the photon wave function ( @xmath110 respectively ) .",
    "the exact value of the suppression is sensitive to the details of the onium wave functions and the dependence of the dipole - nucleon cross section on the size of the dipole @xcite .",
    "the dominance of small @xmath19 configurations in photoproduction processes is relevant for the significant probability of nondiagonal @xmath111 diffractive transitions .",
    "the gvdm adjusted to account for the color screening phenomenon  @xcite allows to take into account qcd dynamics using a hadronic basis .",
    "such a description is limited to the regime of small coherence lengths ( medium energies ) , where leading twist shadowing is not important .",
    "we use the gvdm to consider the coherent photoproduction of hidden charm mesons off nuclei at moderate photon energies @xmath112 where the coherence length for the @xmath113 transition @xmath114 is still close enough to the internucleon distance in nuclei while the formation length @xmath115 is comparable to the radii of heavy nuclei . in this energy range",
    "produced charmonium states have a noticeable probability to rescatter in sufficiently heavy nuclei .",
    "therefore , one would be able to reveal the fluctuation of the charmonium - nucleon interaction strength as due to the diagonal @xmath116 and nondiagonal @xmath117 rescatterings for moderate energies .",
    "the gvdm which we outlined above takes into account the coherence length effects via the glauber model approximation .",
    "the key distinction from the @xmath118meson case is choosing the parameters of the model to account for the space - time evolution of spatially small @xmath19 pair .",
    "it is important that the inelastic shadowing corrections related to the production of higher mass states  @xcite are still insignificant .",
    "a reasonable starting approximation to evaluate the amplitude of the charmonium - nucleon interaction is to restrict ourselves to the basis of @xmath107and @xmath108states for the photon wave function in eq.[gvdm ] .",
    "then , similarly to the considered above case of @xmath119 production we have two equations comprising six elementary amplitudes .",
    "the charmonium - nucleon coupling constants : @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are determined from the widths of the vector meson decays @xmath122 . since in",
    "the photoproduction processes @xmath19 pair is produced within the spatially small configuration one can neglect for a moment by the direct photoproduction amplitude and obtain the approximative relations between rescattering amplitudes    @xmath123    large values for nondiagonal amplitudes @xmath124 are a characteristic qcd property of hidden charm and beauty meson - nucleon interaction .",
    "note that the negative sign of the nondiagonal amplitude is dictated by the qcd factorization theorem . a positive sign of the forward photoproduction @xmath125 amplitudes as well as the signs of the coupling constants @xmath126 and @xmath127 are determined by the signs of the charmonium wave functions at r=0 . from the approximative estimates above",
    "it also follows that @xmath128 .",
    "this is much larger than @xmath129 20 mb   suggested by analyses of the data on @xmath130 absorption in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "when combined with the slac data  @xcite , this corresponds to @xmath131 with large experimental and theoretical errors .    to fix elementary amplitudes more accurately within gvdm ( see @xcite for details )",
    "we parameterized the elementary photoproduction cross section in the form used by the experimentalists of hera to describe their data .",
    "this form has no firm theoretical justification but it is convenient for the fit @xmath132 here @xmath133 is the invariant energy for the photon scattering off a free nucleon , @xmath134 is the reference point and @xmath135 is the two - gluon form factor of a nucleon .",
    "we also used the slac results for the forward @xmath136 cross section   @xcite and for the ratio @xmath137 besides , we fixed the @xmath138 cross section @xmath139 mb as measured at slac@xcite and used the reasonable assumption about the energy dependence of this cross section as the sum of soft and hard physics : @xmath140 the existence of a hard part of the @xmath141n cross section is consistent with the gvdm , because the photoproduction amplitude has a stronger energy dependence than the pomeron exchange , i.e.  soft scattering amplitudes . next , we used this input , the optical theorem and the well known gribov - migdal relation @xmath142 to determine from eq.[gvdm ] all elementary amplitudes in the discussed energy range .",
    "in particular , we found the value @xmath143 mb .",
    "however , the input parameters of the gvdm , namely the experimental cross sections of the forward elementary photoproduction and , especially , the value of @xmath144 , are known with large uncertainties . in result",
    ", we obtained elementary cross sections changing in the ranges : @xmath145 and @xmath146 , in the discussed energy range .",
    "we checked how a variation of @xmath144 within the experimental errors influences our results .",
    "= .9    = 1 .",
    "in our papers@xcite,@xcite we analyzed the coherent photoproduction of charmonia off light(si ) and heavy(pb ) nuclei .",
    "here we present the cross sections of the coherent photoproduction of @xmath141 and @xmath130 off ca .",
    "the energy dependence of these cross sections is compared ( fig.[jpsipsi]a ) to that obtained in the impulse approximation where all rescatterings of the produced vector mesons are neglected , and the cross section is given by the simple formula @xmath147    the distinctive feature of the coherent charmonium photoproduction is that differential cross sections oscillate as a function of the photon energy .",
    "the major source for such a behavior at intermediate energies is oscillating behavior of the longitudinal nuclear form factor at the relatively large values of @xmath148 in the photoproduction vertex .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath107photoproduction in the gvdm is close to that calculated in the impulse approximation - the shapes of curves are very similar and the values of the cross sections are only slightly reduced at energies below 40 gev(fig.[jpsipsi]b ) .",
    "this indicates that it would be very difficult to extract the total @xmath138 cross section from such a measurement . at the same time , since the the nuclear form factor is known with a high precision from the high energy elastic electron - nucleus scattering , one can use the coherent @xmath107photoproduction off the spherical nuclei to determine the elementary @xmath149 amplitude in a wide range of energies for @xmath150 .",
    "the picture is qualitatively different for the coherent @xmath108photoproduction off nuclei . due to the higher threshold ( @xmath151 gev , the direct @xmath108production off nuclei is suppressed in the impulse approximation ( for the same incident energy ) as compared to the @xmath107production by the nuclear form factor . since @xmath152",
    ", the minima of the impulse approximation distribution are shifted .",
    "the contribution of the nondiagonal term @xmath153 essentially increases the @xmath108yield and produces an additional shift of the minima in the spectrum to lower photon energies ( fig .",
    "[ jpsipsi]c ) .",
    "this results in significant effects , especially , if one analyses the data as a function of the mass number a at different energies to extract a - dependence of the @xmath138 cross sections .",
    "it is seen from fig.[adpsi ] that the oscillating form factor significantly influences the a - dependence that complicates extracting of the genuine @xmath138 and @xmath154 cross section from such analysis .",
    "the oscillation of the cross section with energy can be used to measure in a new way the elementary charmonium photoproduction amplitudes as well as the charmonium - nucleon amplitudes using the coherent charmonium photoproduction off light nuclei@xcite . in particular , at the photon energies @xmath155 ( fig .",
    "[ jpsipsi]d ) , the main contribution to the cross section originates from the nondiagonal rescattering . as a result",
    ", one can extract from the data the nondiagonal elementary @xmath156 amplitude by measuring the ratio of the @xmath130 and @xmath141 yields at zero production angle , because other inputs to this ratio such as the elementary @xmath149 amplitude are fixed from the @xmath141 production .",
    "moreover , since other parameters enter both in the numerator and denominator , the major uncertainties are canceled out .",
    "on the other side , the energy dependence of this ratio should originate primarily due to the contribution of the direct @xmath130 production .",
    "thus , one would be able to determine the @xmath157 amplitude from the measurement of the @xmath130-to-@xmath141 ratio .",
    "we want to emphasize that the suggested procedure for extracting the nondiagonal amplitude and amplitudes of direct @xmath141 and @xmath130 photoproduction from the nuclear measurements is practically model independent .",
    "it is much more difficult to determine the diagonal @xmath158 and @xmath159 amplitudes , which are relevant for the suppression of the charmonium yield in heavy ion collisions .    a naive diagonal vdm with @xmath160 based on the slac data  @xcite leads to a rather significant suppression of the @xmath141 yield : @xmath161 for light nuclei , and @xmath162 for heavy nuclei .",
    "however , we find  @xcite a strong compensation of the suppression due to the contribution of the nondiagonal transitions . as a result",
    "we find that overall the suppression does not exceed @xmath163 for all nuclei along the periodical table .",
    "hence , an extraction of the diagonal amplitudes from the measured cross sections would require a comparison of high precision data with very accurate theoretical calculations including the nondiagonal transitions .",
    "another strategy is possible if the elementary @xmath164 , and @xmath157 photoproduction amplitudes , as well as the nondiagonal amplitude @xmath165 would be reliably determined from the medium energy data . in this case",
    "it would be possible to determine the imaginary parts of the forward diagonal amplitudes from the gvdm equations  ( [ gvdm ] ) @xmath166 the suggested procedure allows to determine all elementary amplitudes with a reasonable precision from the measurements of @xmath141 and @xmath130 photoproduction off the light nucleus at the medium photon energies .",
    "the measurement of the coherent charmonium photoproduction off nuclei in this energy region are planned at slac  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of coherent production off heavy nuclei and of the quasielastic production with parameters of gvdm fixed from the analysis of light nuclei would provide a critical test of the model .",
    "the main limitation of the suggested procedure is the restriction of the hadronic basis to the two lowest 1s , 2s charmonium states with the photon quantum numbers : @xmath141 , @xmath130 .",
    "this is one of the key approximations in the discussed approach .",
    "it seems quite reasonable since in the coherent production of vector meson states off nuclei at moderate energies contribution of high mass states is more suppressed by the target form factor .",
    "however , we neglected by @xmath167 which is nearly degenerate in mass with @xmath130 : @xmath168 mev .",

    "angle @xcite . on the contrary , in the perturbative qcd limit the diffractive dijet production , except the charmed dijet production ,",
    "is strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the suppression is due to the structure of coupling of the @xmath13 component of the real photon wave function to two gluons when calculated in the lowest order in @xmath312 . as a result , in the real photon case",
    "hard diffraction involving light quarks is connected to production of @xmath313 and higher states .",
    "distribution of diffractively produced jets over invariant mass provides an important test of the onset of bbl limit .",
    "really , in the dglap / ct regime differential cross section of forward diffractive dijet production should be @xmath314 and be dominated by charm jet production .",
    "this behavior is strikingly different from the bbl limit expressions of @xcite .",
    "thus , the dijet photoproduction should be very sensitive to the onset of the bbl regime .",
    "we want to draw attention that @xmath315 component of the photon light - cone wave function can be measured in three independent diffractive phenomena : in the bbl off the proton , in bbl off a heavy nuclei , in the ct regime where the wave function can be measured as a function of the interquark distance  @xcite .",
    "a competing process for photoproduction of dijets off heavy nuclei is production of dijets in @xmath316 collisions where the second photon is provided by the coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "the dijets produced in this process have positive c - parity and hence this amplitude does not interfere with the amplitude of the dijet production in the @xmath317 interaction which have negative c - parity .",
    "our estimates indicate that this process will constitute a very small background over the wide range of energies @xcite .",
    "ultraperipheral collisions(upc ) of relativistic heavy ions at rhic and lhc open a promising new avenue for experimental studies of the photon induced coherent and incoherent interactions with nuclei at high energies  @xcite .",
    "really , the lhc heavy ion program @xcite will allow studies of photon - proton and photon - nucleus collisions at the energies exceeding by far those available now at hera for @xmath318 scattering .",

    "we can use the standard weizsacker - williams approximation  @xcite to calculate the cross section integrated over the momentum of the nucleus which emits the quasireal photons .",
    "the cross section of the vector meson production integrated over the transverse momenta of the nucleus which emitted a photon can be written in the convoluted form : @xmath319 here y is the rapidity @xmath320 the flux of the equivalent photons @xmath321 is given by a simple expression  @xcite : @xmath322.\\ ] ] here @xmath323 and @xmath324 are modified bessel functions with argument @xmath325 , @xmath326 is lorentz factor and @xmath327 is the impact parameter .",
    "the glauber profile factor @xmath328 accounts for the inelastic strong interactions of the nuclei at impact parameters @xmath329 and , hence , suppresses the corresponding contribution of the vector meson photoproduction .",
    "recently the star collaboration released the first data on the cross section of the coherent @xmath330-meson production in gold - gold upc at @xmath331 gev  @xcite .",
    "this provides a first opportunity to check the basic features of the theoretical models and main approximations which include the weizscker - williams ( ww ) approximation for the spectrum of the equivalent photons , an approximate procedure for removing collisions at small impact parameters where nuclei interact strongly , and the model for the vector meson production in the @xmath332 interactions . in the case of the @xmath0-meson production the basic process",
    "is understood much better than for other photoproduction processes .",
    "hence , checking the theory for this case is especially important for proving that upc could be used for learning new information about photon - nucleus interactions .",
    "note here that the inelastic shadowing effects which start to contribute at high energies still remain a few percent correction at energies @xmath333 100 gev relevant for the star kinematics . for lhc energy range one should account for the blackening of interaction with nuclei . in this case",
    "cross section of inelastic diffraction in hadron - nucleus collisions should tend to 0 .",
    "so major impact for the calculation of the process of diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 meson would be necessity to neglect by the contribution of @xmath1  @xcite .    the calculated momentum transfer distributions at the rapidity @xmath334 and the momentum transfer integrated rapidity distribution for gold - gold upc at @xmath335 gev are presented in figs .",

    "correspondingly , the calculated incoherent cross section for this region of @xmath336 is @xmath339 mb .",
    "our calculations of incoherent production which are based on accounting for only the single elementary diffractive collision obviously present the lower limit",
    ". the residual nucleus will be weakly excited and can evaporate only one - two neutrons .",
    "the events @xmath340 were detected by the star and identified as a two - stage process - coherent @xmath330-production with the subsequent electromagnetic excitation and neutron decay of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cross section estimated by the star for the case when only one of the nuclei is excited and emits several neutrons is @xmath341 mb .",
    "the momentum transfer distribution for these events is determined by the coherent production .",
    "hence , it differs from that for incoherent events but in the region of very low @xmath336 it is hardly possible to separate them experimentally , and the measured cross section @xmath342 includes contribution of incoherent events on the level of @xmath343 .",
    "the total rapidity - integrated cross section of coherent @xmath330-meson production calculated in the gvdm for the range of energies available at rhic is shown in fig .",
    "[ figstar2](solid line ) .",

    "the value @xmath345 mb was obtained at this energy by the star from the data analysis at the low momentum transfer @xmath338 gev@xmath34 .",

    "we did nt account for the @xmath336-dependence of the elementary amplitudes which are rather flat in the considered range of energies and momentum transfers as compared to that for the nucleus form factor .",
    "so , in the region of integration important for our analysis it is reasonable to neglect this slope .",
    "nevertheless , an account of this effect would slightly reduce our estimate of the total cross section .",

    "all these effects do not influence noticeably the value of the @xmath336-integrated cross section but can be easy treated and taken into account in a more refined analysis .",

    ". at the same time estimates of the counting rates performed within the framework of the felix study @xcite have demonstrated that the effective photon luminosities generated in peripheral heavy ion collisions at lhc would lead to significant rates of coherent photoproduction of vector mesons including @xmath4 in reaction @xmath349 as a result it would be possible to study at lhc photoproduction of vector mesons in pb - pb and ca - ca collisions at energies much higher than the range @xmath350 gev covered at the fixed target experiment at fnal @xcite .",
    "note that even current experiments at rhic ( @xmath351 gev ) should also exceed this limit .",
    "as it is clearly indicated by the star study the coherent photoproduction , leaving the both interacting nuclei intact , can be reliably identified by using the veto triggering from the two - side zero degree calorimeters which select the events not comprising the escaped neutrons . the additional requirement which enables to remove contribution of the incoherent events with the residual nucleus in the ground state is selection of the produced quarkonium with small transverse momentum . in fig .",
    "[ lhcdst ] we compare the momentum transfer distributions for the coherent @xmath141 and @xmath4 photoproduction calculated in the leading twist shadowing model with the corresponding distributions for incoherent photoproduction .",
    "note that we estimated the upper limit of incoherent cross section simply as the free elementary cross section on the nucleon target multiplied by the number of nucleons a.    in fig .",
    "[ figlhc1]a , b we present the rapidity distributions of the @xmath141 coherent production for peripheral collisions at lhc calculated including effects of gluon shadowing and in the impulse approximation . at the central rapidities we find suppression by a factor 4 for a case of ca and more strong , by a factor 6 for pb .",

    "an account of nondiagonal transitions leads to a prediction of a significant enhancement of production of heavier diffractive states especially production of high @xmath21 dijets .",
    "study of these channels may allow to get an important information on the onset of the black body limit in the diffraction of real photons .",
    "we argued that the fluctuations of strengths of interactions has been observed at intermediate energies in the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons .",
