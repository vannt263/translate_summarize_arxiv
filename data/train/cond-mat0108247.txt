    "random - graph models are particularly attractive @xcite , since they combine the analytic accessibility within the framework of mean - field theory @xcite with the finite connectivity of short - range , finite - dimensional models .",
    "furthermore , random - graph models occur in problems of combinatorial optimisation and theoretical computer science @xcite , where solving e.g. a satisfiability or a matching problem is equivalent to finding the ground - state of a spin - model on a graph . considering statistical ensembles of such problems with the aim of characterizing typical problems",
    "corresponds to defining an ensemble of random graphs .",
    "interest in random - graph models has intensified lately and led to solution schemes beyond replica - symmetry @xcite .    for fully connected systems ,",
    "where the local field at each site is the sum of many random terms , the central limit theorem ensures that the local fields are gaussian distributed .",
    "the distribution of fields may thus be characterized  at the level of replica symmetry  by two variables , the mean and the variance of this distribution .",
    "the free energy is thus characterized by a few order - parameters , which are determined self - consistently .",
    "finite - connectivity models on random graphs are mean - field models where the local fields do not consist of many terms and consequently are not gaussian distributed .",
    "the free energy is characterized by a continuous order - parameter function  the distribution of local fields .",
    "a key step simplifying the replica analysis of random graphs models has been the introduction of a global order - parameter function @xcite . in the case of hamiltonians containing 2-spin , 3-spin , and",
    "higher interaction terms , the sums emerging from averaging over the disorder may be disentangled using the order parameter function @xmath6 .",
    "this function gives the fraction of sites , whose replicated spins @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are in a given configuration @xmath9 .    in principle",
    "any function of the spin configuration may be written as a sum of 2-spin , 3-spin , and higher interaction terms and used as an energy function .",
    "however correlations between these interactions may make the resulting hamiltonian intractable . in this paper",
    "we discuss how to treat random - graph models with hamiltonians with a non - trivial dependence on the local magnetic field at each site .",

    "furthermore such an order - parameter function ought to admit a replica - symmetric ansatz or other schemes and an analytic continuation @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we show that this need is answered by a two - argument order - parameter function @xmath15 . viewing the variables @xmath16 as new phase - space variables coupled to the spins",

    "we calculate the quenched average in replica - symmetry of the number of metastable configurations in one of the simplest model on a random graph , the ferromagnetic 2-spin model . for this model some results have already been obtained , albeit restricted to the annealed approximation , both for graphs with fixed connectivity @xcite and fluctuating connectivity @xcite .",
    "for fully - connected disordered systems , like the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , the problem of metastable states has been dealt with in the classic paper by bray and moore @xcite .",
    "metastable configurations have each spin pointing in the direction of its local field , i.e. they are stable ( or marginally stable ) against single - spin flips .",
    "as so - called inherent structures , such configurations play a crucial role in structural glasses @xcite . in spin - models of dense granular matter they play the role of blocked configurations @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians which non - trivially depend on the local magnetisation also occur in the context of lattice - gases , e.g. where sites with more than a certain number of neighbouring particles are energetically penalized @xcite .",
    "finally , a treatment of the dynamics of spin models on random graphs will need an order - parameter function ( generating function ) analogous to the one introduced here , since the dynamics depends explicitly on the local field at each point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first the ferromagnetic 2-spin model on a random graph is introduced . after discussing the annealed approximation to the problem ,",
    "the calculation of the quenched average of the number of metastable configurations is outlined in section [ twospin ] .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the 2-argument global order - parameter function .",
    "the replica - symmetric ansatz for the order - parameter function is discussed and the replica - symmetric result for the entropy of metastable configurations is given .",
    "these expressions are evaluated numerically and are compared to the results of monte - carlo simulations and thermodynamic integration of an auxiliary model in section [ results ] .",
    "the results of generalizing the problem to 3-spin models are given in section [ threespin ] and the generalisation to models with frustrated interactions is discussed in section [ disorder ] .",
    "in the following we consider one of the simplest spin - models on a random graph , namely the two - spin ferromagnetic model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath19 where the sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the variable @xmath22 with @xmath23 denotes the presence of a bond connecting sites @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes its absence .",

    "the condition for a ( marginally ) metastable configuration is that at each site @xmath2 the local field @xmath30 obeys @xmath31 .",
    "this definition implies that a number of neutral moves remains , as spins with zero local field may be flipped without a cost in energy .",
    "we choose this definition , since a quench of the system will in general leave a number of spins with zero local field , which are crucial to the subsequent dynamics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the marginally stable states could be excluded easily by considering only configurations with non - zero local magnetic field .",
    "it is instructive to see how the average number of blocked configurations is calculated in the annealed approximation , where the partition function is averaged directly over the ensemble of random graphs , before passing to the more complicated case of the quenched average .",

    "however the form of ( [ rsspe ] ) as an invariant density suggests the use of a simple population dynamics to solve the self - consistent equation and evaluate the entropy of metastable configurations and other physical quantities . recently",
    "this population dynamics has been used extensively in @xcite . for the present problem",
    "it may be adopted as follows : we consider a large number @xmath91 of triples labeled @xmath92 of numbers @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",

    "in the same way the expressions ( [ rsener])-([rsfree ] ) may be evaluated .",
    "choosing a set of @xmath95 triples at random ( where @xmath95 is sampled from the appropriate distribution ) the integrands of ( [ rsener])-([rsfree ] ) may be computed .",
    "averaging the results of sufficiently many such steps we obtain approximations of the multiple integrals over @xmath100 in these expressions .",
    "the results discussed in the following section were obtained with @xmath101 , @xmath102 iterations steps , and @xmath103 steps to calculate ( [ rsener])-([rsfree ] ) .",
    "to check our analytical results - evaluated numerically - against the results of numerical simulations , we use a method based on monte - carlo simulation of an auxiliary model and thermodynamic integration . denoting the number of sites with @xmath31 as @xmath104 we define the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the original hamiltonian ( [ hdef ] ) and",
    "@xmath85 is a lagrange multiplier fixing the energy @xmath108 of the original system . by construction ,",
    "the states accessed in the limit @xmath109 of @xmath105 are the blocked configuration of the original hamiltonian with energy @xmath108 fixed by the parameter @xmath85 ( provided they exist)@xcite .",
    "numerically , blocked configurations of ( [ hdef ] ) of a given energy may thus be generated by a monte - carlo dynamics of the auxiliary hamiltonian ( [ h_aux ] ) , starting at a low auxiliary temperature @xmath110 , and gradually increasing @xmath111 until the ground state is found .",
    "the auxiliary temperature must be changed sufficiently gradually to ensure the system always remains in equilibrium .",
    "having taken the limit @xmath109 the lagrange multiplier @xmath85 is simply the inverse temperature of the blocked configurations .",
    "thus the entropy of the blocked configurations may be obtained up to a constant by thermodynamic integration @xmath112    the numerical results of the following section were generated by annealing ( [ h_aux ] ) on four realisations of a random graph with @xmath113 increasing @xmath111 from 0 to 10 in steps 0.001 every 2000 monte - carlo sweeps . at the end of this process the energy @xmath108 , the fraction of sites with zero local field , and the magnetisation were measured during the last 250 monte - carlo sweeps .",
    "furthermore we checked the independence of the results on the annealing rate . in the case of the entropy ,",
    "the constant of integration was obtained simply by fitting the resulting curve to the analytic result .",
    "in the following we describe the results of the calculations of the preceding section for the case @xmath114 and compare them to the results of numerical simulations . in figure [ figsc2 ]",
    "we plot both the annealed and the quenched result for the entropy of blocked configurations .",
    "the results of the quenched average evaluated according to the algorithm of section [ twospinnum ] fluctuate somewhat , so the curve is not very smooth , especially at negative temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , very good agreement between the results of numerical simulation according to section [ numerics ] and the quenched average of the entropy is found .",
    "the maximum of the entropy is reached at energies around @xmath115 , so a randomly chosen blocked configuration will have this energy with a probability approaching @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit . in the ground state @xmath116 ,",
    "all spins of a cluster of connected points are aligned .",
    "hence the entropy density of blocked configurations is simply the number of disconnected clusters of the graph times @xmath117 . using the standard results of random graph theory @xcite",
    "we obtain a ground state entropy of @xmath118 , which agrees with the present result to within numerical precision .",
    "= .3    in figure [ figgc2 ] we show the fraction of sites with zero local magnetic field as a function of the energy density @xmath108 , which increases monotonously with @xmath108 .",
    "this effect arises since blocked sites with non - zero magnetic field give a negative contribution to the energy . in order to obtain blocked states also at high energies ,",
    "the system must thus make more of the local fields equal to zero .",
    "this is also the reason for the decrease of the entropy at increasing energies .",
    "= .3    in figure [ figmc2 ] we plot the absolute value of the magnetisation of blocked configurations against the energy density .",
    "there is a second - order phase - transition from configurations with zero magnetic field at high energies , to a ferromagnetic phase at low energies . again",
    "the mechanism for this is simple : in order to form blocked configurations at low energies , ( absolutely ) large local fields are required .",
    "these are achieved most easily by giving the system a finite magnetisation .",
    "this simply reflects the analogous transition in the model without the blocking condition , although the transition occurs at a lower energy . at the transition ,",
    "the rs order - parameter function changes qualitatively : in the high - temperature phase , its weight is concentrated at @xmath119 and it remains a non - trivial function only of @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121 , whereas in the low - temperature phase @xmath80 is a non - trivial function of all its arguments .",
    "= .3    in figure [ figebeta ] we plot the energy versus the inverse temperature of the blocked configurations @xmath85 for three connectivities",
    "we note that the kink in the curve  signifying the second - order nature of the phase transition ",
    "becomes more pronounced at higher connectivities . at @xmath123 it appears that there is a jump in the curve , which would signify that the transition had become first order .",
    "furthermore , for finite running times , the algorithm solving the saddle - point equations shows hysteresis .",
    "however none of this is borne out by closer analysis .",
    "near the transition , the three curves in figure [ figebeta ] collapse onto each other when rescaled by the width @xmath124 over which the transition occurs .",
    "furthermore the hysteresis in the algorithm disappears when a small magnetic field is applied .",
    "we thus conclude that at high connectivities , the transition remains of second order , but is characterized by a long plateau at the transition point .",
    "= .3    finally , in figure [ phase_diag ] the phase diagram of the transition to ferromagnetic blocked states is given .",
    "below the percolation threshold of the graph @xmath125 blocked states are typically not magnetised since the graph consists of many small disconnected clusters : flipping all spins of such a cluster leads from one blocked configuration to another . as a result @xmath126 diverges as @xmath125 is approached from above .",
    "increasing @xmath29 the critical value of @xmath85 and of the corresponding energy decreases monotonously as expected .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting that the critical energy saturates already around @xmath127 .",

    "the integral over @xmath64 turns into a delta - function again  so the sum over @xmath160 may be performed  after the exponential term containing the order - parameter function has been expanded as a power series .",
    "now we need to insert the rs - ansatz ( [ rsop ] ) into the self - consistent equation ( [ spe ] ) . collecting all terms carrying replica - indices in the @xmath95th term we have @xmath161 where @xmath82 is defined in ( [ fdef ] ) . in the last step",
    "the we used @xmath162 writing @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 the limit @xmath14 may be taken .",
    "collecting all terms in @xmath95 and fourier - transforming with respect to @xmath166 we obtain the self - consistent equation in rs in the form ( [ rsspe ] ) .",
    "the calculation of ( [ rsener])-([rsfree ] ) follow the same scheme .",
