    "the nuclei provide the matters with mass , the stars with fuel , and the universe with a variety of elements .",
    "it was discovered by ernest rutherford and coworkers about 100 years ago @xcite , that explains the large - angle scattering of alpha particles by a gold foil @xcite .",
    "this discovery was also a beginning of the era of the quantum mechanics .",
    "rutherford estimated the upper limit of the nuclear size which turned out to be much smaller than that of the atom . in the atomic scale (  ) , the nuclear size ( fm ) could be regarded as just a point ! according to the classical mechanics",
    ", the atoms must collapse into nuclear size , because the attractive coulomb potential eventually brings all the electrons into the nucleus .",
    "this mystery stimulated niels bohr to develop his idea on the quantum mechanics @xcite .      with a knowledge of the quantum mechanics , it is easy to understand why the atoms do not collapse to the nuclear scale .",
    "if an electron was confined in the nuclear scale of femtometer , the uncertainty principle immediately tells us that its zero - point kinetic energy would become gigantic ( order of gev ) . in order to decrease this kinetic energy to a reasonable magnitude",
    ", the electron s wave function must have an atomic size of  .",
    "thus , the atomic size is a consequence of the quantum effect .",
    "the molecules ( and the solids ) are a good contrast to atoms .",
    "the atom is bound by the coulomb interaction , whose range is infinite ( @xmath0 ) , between a positively charged nucleus and electrons with a negative charge .",
    "since the molecules consist of these charge - neutral atoms , the interaction between a pair of neutral atoms does not have the long - range tail of @xmath1 , but normally has a short - range repulsive part and an intermediate - range attractive part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aa - nn](a ) ) . because of this charge neutrality , the molecule is easy to disintegrate into smaller units ( molecules and atoms ) .",
    "the atomic size is approximately constant and independent from the atomic number , while the molecular size varies depending on the number of atoms and their kinds .",
    "last but not the least , in the zero - th order approximation , the ground states of the molecules can be classically described as atoms located at fixed relative positions .",
    "the hindered quantum fluctuation in molecules is simply due to the fact that the atomic mass , which is approximately identical to the nuclear mass , is about 2,000 times larger than the electronic mass .",
    "the nucleus has a number of properties analogous to the molecules , except for its strong quantum nature .",
    "it is a self - bound system composed of fermions of spin @xmath2 and isospin @xmath2 with approximately equal masses , called nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) .",
    "the nuclear species are classified by the numbers of neutrons ( @xmath3 ) and protons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "rutherford discovered that the size of the nucleus is as tiny as the femtometer , but later it was found that the nuclear size varies , as its volume is roughly proportional to the mass number ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "each nucleon is a color - singlet ( neutral ) object .",
    "the interaction between a pair of nucleons ( nuclear force ) has a finite range of a scale of the pion compton wave length ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "[ fig : aa - nn ] , we show schematic pictures of the atomic and nucleonic potentials .",
    "the ground state of the diatomic molecule ( panel ( a ) ) is formed at the bottom of the potential , @xmath14 . in the length scale of  ,",
    "the atomic mass is heavy enough to localize the wave function at the location of the bottom of the potential , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the relative distance between a pair of atoms is fixed at @xmath16 .",
    "this property allows us to describe the atomic motion in the classical mechanics , such as in the molecular dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the nuclear interaction is not strong enough to bind nucleons at the bottom of the potential . in other words ,",
    "the nucleon s mass is too light to localize the wave function in the sub - femtometer scale . in deuteron",
    ", the zero - point kinetic energy cancels the negative potential energy ( @xmath17 ) , leading to a bound state at approximately zero energy ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the deuteron wave function spatially extends beyond the range of nuclear force ( @xmath19 ) , which reduces the kinetic energy @xmath20 .",
    "this shows a striking contrast to the diatomic molecule , and is even analogous to the atoms , that the large size of the deuteron is a consequence of the quantum effect .",
    "this strong quantum nature also tells us that the infinite nuclear matter will not be crystallized even at zero temperature , but will stay as the liquid .",
    "the nuclear system provides us with unique opportunities to study femto - scale quantum liquids .",
    "the strong quantum nature in finite nuclei leads to a rich variety of unique phenomena .",
    "remarkable experimental progress in production and study of exotic nuclei requires us to construct theoretical and computational approaches with high accuracy and a reliable predictive power .",
    "extensive studies have been made for constructing theoretical models to elucidate basic nuclear dynamics behind a variety of nuclear phenomena .",
    "simultaneously , significant efforts have been made in the microscopic foundation of those models .",
    "for light nuclei , the `` first - principles '' large - scale computation , starting from the bare nucleon - nucleon ( two - body & three - body ) forces , is becoming a current trend in theoretical nuclear physics . among them",
    ", the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method is the most successful first - principles approach to nuclear structure calculation @xcite . in this approach , using the monte carlo technique , the many - body wave function is sampled in the coordinate space with spin and isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "the success of the gfmc clearly demonstrates that we are able to construct a light nucleus from the scratch on the computer .",
    "the gfmc method has been applied to nuclei up to the mass number @xmath21 .",
    "another first - principles approach is to project the nuclear hamiltonian in a truncated hilbert space , then diagonalize it .",
    "this is called no - core shell - model ( ncsm ) method @xcite .",
    "the ncsm also shows successful applications up to the @xmath22-shell nuclei .",
    "the gfmc and ncsm both indicate the exponential increase in computational tasks with respect to the increasing nucleon number .",
    "the third approach , the coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) , has an advantage that the required computation increases only in power with respect to the nucleon number .",
    "the ccm , which was originally invented in nuclear physics @xcite and later became extremely successful in quantum chemistry @xcite , has been revisited as an ab - initio computational approach to nuclear structure @xcite . especially , it is powerful to study closed - shell nuclei .    although these first - principles approaches have recently shown a significant progress , they are still limited to nuclei with the small mass number .",
    "this may sound mysterious to physicists in other fields , because we know that the similar kinds of approaches are able to treat systems of much larger particle numbers .",
    "for instance , using the ccm , nowadays , the chemists can easily calculate a molecular structure with 100 electrons . why is the first - principles calculation of nuclear structure so difficult ?",
    "the answer is perhaps trivial for nuclear physicists , but may not be so for others .",
    "let us pick up several important aspects leading to this answer .",
    "( 1 ) the strong quantum nature .",
    "as we have discussed previously , the full quantum mechanical treatment is necessary for nuclear structure calculation .",
    "( 2 ) strong coupling nature .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon scattering length is approximately @xmath23 fm in @xmath24 channel .",
    "this is much larger than the mean distance between nucleons inside the nucleus ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "( 3 ) singular property of the nucleonic interaction . to reproduce the phase shift for the nucleon - nucleon scattering ,",
    "the interaction should have a strong repulsive core at short distance @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) complexity of the nucleonic interaction .",
    "the interaction has a strong state dependence which may be represented by the spin- and isospin - dependence @xcite .",
    "it also contains strong non - central and non - local terms , such as tensor and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "furthermore , for a quantitative description of nuclei , it is indispensable to introduce three - body interactions in addition to the two - body force .",
    "( 5 ) coexistence of different interactions .",
    "in addition to the strong interaction , we need to treat the electromagnetic interactions among protons .",
    "( 6 ) coexistence of different energy scales .",
    "the nuclear binding energy amounts to order of gev for heavy nuclei .",
    "because of the strong quantum nature in nuclei , this is a consequence of the cancellation between positive kinetic energy and negative potential energy .",
    "thus , we need to compute these enormous positive and negative components in high accuracy to obtain a correct binding energy . ( 7 ) fermionic nature of nucleons . needless to say , since the nucleons are fermions , the total wave function must be anti - symmetrized .",
    "( 8) finite systems without an external potential .",
    "electronic many - body problems in molecules and solids are solved with external fields produced by nuclei with positive charges .",
    "in contrast , the nucleus is a self - bound finite system .",
    "thus , we are usually required to obtain an intrinsic wave function without the center - of - mass degrees of freedom .",
    "this requirement often restricts our choice of the basis functions .    despite of these difficulties , significant advances in the computer power",
    "may lead to a realistic `` first - principles '' construction of the @xmath26-shell nuclei in near future .",
    "there have been extensive efforts toward this direction , especially developing an algorithm suitable for parallel use of the vast number of processors @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the first - principles calculations , which are limited to nuclei with small number of nucleons , the density functional theory ( dft ) is currently a leading theory for describing nuclear properties of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is capable of describing almost all nuclei , including nuclear matter , with a single universal energy density functional ( edf ) . an argument based on the quantum many - body theory leading to nuclear edf",
    "was also developed in 70s@xmath2780 s @xcite . in addition , its strict theoretical foundation is given by the basic theorem of the dft @xcite . since the nucleus is a self - bound system without an external potential , we should slightly modify the dft theorem .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic_formalism ] .",
    "the nucleus by itself produces a potential confining nucleons which is analogous to the kohn - sham potential in dft @xcite .",
    "nuclear physicists often call this potential `` mean field '' , though it is different from a naive mean - field potential directly constructed from the nucleonic interaction .",
    "there are many evidences for the fact that the mean - free path of nucleons inside the nucleus is significantly larger than the nuclear radius @xcite , in spite of the strong ( and even singular ) two - body interaction .",
    "this is partially due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "since the nucleon mean - free path is roughly proportional to @xmath28 @xcite , it is significantly enhanced for nucleons whose energies are close to the fermi energy .",
    "another even simpler argument was given by bohr and mottelson @xcite , that the nuclear normal density is much lower than the one giving the close packing limit ( crystalline limit ) . in this argument",
    ", the quantum effect plays a primary role .",
    "the dft theorem guarantees the existence of generalized density functionals for every physical observable ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : basic_formalism ] ) .",
    "however , to construct the exact functional , we need experimental data and other theoretical inputs .",
    "currently , there are a variety of edfs which predict somewhat different properties for nuclei very far from the stability line .",
    "we are in want of finding an ultimate universal energy density functional , which is capable of exact description of every nucleus in the nuclear chart .",
    "in addition to the recent progress in the first - principles calculations for light nuclei , the radioactive beam facilities in the world will give us ideal opportunities to determine the parameter set for a better functional .",
    "new data on neutron halos and skins in medium heavy nuclei may provide important information on its dependence on density and density gradient .",
    "observation of new isotopes in a long isotopic ( isotonic ) chain may lead to useful constraints on the isovector parts of the energy functional .",
    "an extension of the dft to the time - dependent dft ( tddft ) provides a feasible description of many - body dynamics , which contains information on excited states in addition to the ground state .",
    "the tddft is justified by the one - to - one correspondence between the time - dependent density and time - dependent external potential @xcite , which will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : tddft ] .",
    "the tddft has vast applications to quantum phenomena in many - body systems . among them",
    ", the perturbative regime has been mostly studied so far .",
    "different approaches to the linear response calculations will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbative_regime ] .",
    "it is of significant interest but challenging to go beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "nuclei show numerous phenomena related to the large amplitude collective motion , such as fission , shape transition , shape coexistence , anharmonic vibrations , and so on .",
    "we present , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lacm ] , a theory to identify an optimal collective submanifold in the classical phase space of large dimensions .",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) has been extremely successful for calculations of ground - state properties of atoms , molecules , and solids .",
    "it describes a many - particle system exactly in terms of its one - body density alone .",
    "the dft is based on the original theorem of hohenberg and kohn ( hk ) @xcite which was proved for the ground - state of the many - particle system .",
    "every observable can be written , in principle , as a functional of density .    in nuclear physics , however , we need to treat an isolated system without an external potential .",
    "the present nuclear edf produces a localized density profile without an external potential .",
    "thus , the ground state spontaneously violates the translational symmetry and seems to contain spurious excitation related to the center - of - mass motion .",
    "furthermore , it also violates the rotational symmetry when the ground state is spontaneously deformed .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the nuclear edf can be theoretically justified in a strict sense .",
    "we present a possible justification in sec .",
    "[ sec : dft_wave_packet ] , according to the recent progress @xcite .",
    "the hk theorem @xcite guarantees one - to - one mapping between a one - body density @xmath29 and an external potential @xmath30 .",
    "then , since the ground - state wave function is a functional of density , in principle , all the observables should be functionals of the density as well .",
    "however , to describe an isolated self - bound finite system in a box of volume @xmath31 , it is somewhat useless to use the ground - state density in the laboratory frame , because it must be constant , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , where @xmath3 is the particle number . instead , we want to use a functional of the _ intrinsic _ density @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the center - of - mass coordinate of the total system . in this case",
    ", the original hk theorem can not be justified , because it adopts a one - body external field @xmath30 coupled to the density @xmath29 in the laboratory frame .",
    "validity of the dft for the intrinsic states has been discussed by several authors @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present a method to define the dft for an intrinsic state , more precisely for a `` wave - packet '' state .",
    "the argument here essentially follows the idea by giraud et al @xcite .",
    "in fact , all the nuclear edfs , currently available , produce a _ wave - packet _ state .",
    "the minimization of an edf @xmath36 $ ] without the external potential ( @xmath37 ) leads to the nucleon density distribution @xmath29 with a finite radius .",
    "this violates the translational symmetry of the original hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , it is of our interest here to justify the energy functional of the _ wave - packet _ density in the laboratory frame in a strict sense .",
    "first , we assume that a wave - packet state in the laboratory frame can be expressed by a product wave function of _ intrinsic _ and _ spurious _ degrees of freedom , @xmath38 . here",
    ", @xmath39 indicates the intrinsic state and @xmath40 defines the spurious motion .",
    "this decomposition can be exactly done for the translational motion .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath35 @xmath42 denote the center - of - mass coordinates ( total momenta ) . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the relative jacobi coordinates and their conjugate momenta , respectively .",
    "since the intrinsic ground state , which is supposed to be unique , is completely independent from the spurious motion , we can adopt an arbitrary form of @xmath45 ; e.g. , @xmath46 .",
    "then , the ground wave - packet state can be obtained by the variation after the projection : @xmath47\\ ] ] where the projection operator @xmath48 does not change the intrinsic state @xmath39 but makes @xmath45 an eigenstate of the total linear momentum @xmath49 .",
    "the variation with respect to the full space ( @xmath38 ) contradicts the uniqueness of the ground state , because states with different @xmath45 give the same @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the variation here should be performed with respect only to the intrinsic state @xmath39 .",
    "this is indicated by the subscript `` @xmath51:fixed '' in eq .",

    "there are numerous recent works , in the skyrme energy functionals @xcite the gogny energy functionals @xcite , and the covariant edfs @xcite , to construct the collective bohr hamiltonian with the microscopic inputs .",
    "however , the collective mass parameters are further approximated by the inglis - cranking formula .",
    "since this cranking approximation has a well - known defect leading to a disagreement with experiments , the phenomenological scaling to increase the collective mass by roughly @xmath724 % , is often adopted .",
    "this comes from the fact that the cranking formula neglects the time - odd mean fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , the replacement of the cranking mass by the mfhe mass should solve this problem .",
    "the mfhe with the skyrme energy functional has been applied to studies of cr isotopes with the above approximations and a restriction to the 1d shape degree @xcite . in a very recent work @xcite ,",

    ", we mainly focus our discussion on the basic concepts of the nuclear dft and applications of the time - dependent dft ( tddft ) .",
    "the nucleus is a self - bound isolated system without an external potential .",
    "this produces a situation different from many - electron systems with the external coulomb potentials .",

    "should be generalized to include the pair density ( abnormal density ) in addition to the normal density .",
    "this can be done with the generalized scheme by bogoliubov .",
    "the tddft was also established , in the same manner as the hohenberg - kohn , by the one - to - one correspondence between the potential and density depending on time .",
    "most applications of the tddft are performed in the perturbative linear response regime . even in the linear regime , because of the complexity of the edfs of nuclei , it is computationally very demanding to perform the numerical calculations and requires significant works for its program coding .",
    "there are several approaches to the linear - response calculations , each of which has an advantage and disadvantage .",
    "this has been discussed in details in sec .  [",

    "we have presented a theory of a decoupled collective space inside the large tddft phase space in sec .",
    "[ sec : lacm ] . in case that the collective motion of interest is slow relative to the other intrinsic degrees of freedom , self - consistent solutions of the moving - frame harmonic equation ( mfhe ) with the constraint minimization of the edf provide microscopic determination of the collective variables and the collective hamiltonian .    in sec .",

    "currently available edfs are able to reproduce the gdr in heavy nuclei , however , have a problem for that in light nuclei .",
    "we also presented the applications of the mfhe to shape coexistence phenomena in @xmath664se .",
