    "hard spheres with solely steric repulsion are an important model system in the field of soft condensed matter as they exhibit not only a fluid and a crystalline phase @xcite , but there occurs a dramatic slowdown of dynamics when also the density of the particles is increased @xcite .",

    "many theoretical approaches to describe glassy dynamics are based on cage breaking events , e.g. , the widely - used mode coupling theory @xcite or models that consider activated hopping of particles out of a cage @xcite .",

    "therefore , the structure of a cage that traps a particle close to a wall can be determined theoretically @xcite ( the full gamut of classical dft is covered in @xcite ) . as we will show later",
    ", structural results will be important to understand the anisotropic cage breaking dynamics .",
    "for the system that we consider here , we have resolved the anisotropic structures in a previous work @xcite , where we studied a glass - forming binary hard - sphere mixture close to a wall by applying the white bear mark ii framework of fundamental measure theory @xcite , a quantitative benchmark dft for hard spheres @xcite .",

    "half of the particles possess the effective diameter @xmath0 and the other half has a larger diameter @xmath1 .",
    "usually we consider @xmath2 particles in a three dimensional cubic box with periodic boundary conditions in two directions ( the @xmath3- and @xmath4-direction in our choice of the coordinate system ) and closed by two walls normal to third direction ( the @xmath5-direction ) .",
    "we typically combine the number densities @xmath6 of each species @xmath7 in a total packing fraction @xmath8 . the spheres , as sketched in fig .

    "in the limit of small temperatures @xmath14 and large interaction strengths , i.e. for @xmath15 with boltzmann s constant @xmath16 , the structure and dynamics of the system correspond to the structure and dynamics of a hard sphere system @xcite .",
    "we have chosen @xmath13 such that for a given temperature the average overlap between two particles or between a particle and the wall does not exceed @xmath17 of the diameter @xmath0 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of our bd simulations is given by the overdamped langevin equation @xmath18 the friction constants @xmath19 are proportional to the diameter @xmath12 of the spheres .",

    "we employ @xmath26 as a suitable brownian time throughout the article , where @xmath27 is the coefficient of free diffusion of the small spheres .",
    "more details about the simulations and an analysis of the hard sphere limit are given in a previous work @xcite , where we studied the structure of a binary hard - sphere system in the vicinity of a hard wall by simulations and dft calculations .",
    "in dense systems each particle is surrounded by a cage of neighboring particles ( see for instance fig .  [",

    "such a cage can possess any orientation and , for this reason , a mean field description usually is isotropic . instead , close to walls a preferred orientation of the cage exists .",

    "figure  [ fig : vanhovecompilation](a ) displays @xmath34 for small particles ( first row ) and @xmath35 for large particles ( second row ) at a volume fraction @xmath36 and for different evolution times , as indicated .",
    "the caging of particles is visible in the slowed down diffusive dynamics for shorter times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] , ( ) and ( ) ) . of course",
    ", diffusion is prohibited inside the wall , but the overall diffusion process in all remaining directions still looks rather homogeneous as long as the particle does not leave its cage . for a density close to the glass transition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vanhovecompilation](b ) for @xmath37 ) , @xmath28 displays an even slower diffusion process ( note the different timescales ) . on the same time",
    ", the diffusion within the cage becomes more anisotropic , e.g. , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] ( ) no preferred direction of motion is visible , close to the glass transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] ( ) a particle within a cage more likely moves parallel to the wall and the motion in all other directions is suppressed . in all cases ,",
    "the small particles diffuse faster as expected from the smaller friction constant @xmath38 .    for sufficiently long times",
    ", we can identify different escape routes along which the particle can leave the cage . besides a diffusive spread within the first layer in direction parallel to the wall , smaller particles tend to use a perpendicular path to swap into the second layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] , ( ) ) before they spread in parallel directions again ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] , ( ) ) . for the large particles , however , the typical diffusion paths are different .",
    "first , when large particles approach the second layer , they spread much slower along the second layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] , ( ) ) than the small particles do .",
    "second , when large particles arrive at a distance of approximately @xmath39 , their most likely trajectories branch away from the @xmath5-axis , while small particles also stay at the @xmath5-axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] , ( ) and ( ) ) .",
    "this can be explained by a preferred stacking of large particles above small particles .",
    "if a large particle was initially located next to a small one , it raises towards the second layer until it is possible to stack with its smaller neighbor . in order to do so",
    ", it leaves the actual perpendicular path .",
    "the last plot of the time series of the large particles van hove function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhovecompilation ] , ( ) ) suggests that first isolated peaks evolve before the probability density washes out in the second layer .",
    "these two mechanisms , namely the perpendicular diffusion of the small and the tilted diffusion of the large particles , account for local rearrangement processes . such rearrangements also occur in the bulk case , but due to isotropy with no preferred direction . due to our symmetry breaking wall , in our situation",
    "the probability densities @xmath28 are anisotropic and bear pre - defined more probable diffusion paths due to the structure of the local neighborhood .        to quantify this effect we explore the consequences of the anisotropic escape routes for the directional dependence of the mean squared displacements ( msd ) .",
    "as we will show in the following , the diffusion process and the accompanied escape from the cage into a certain direction are similar to the diffusion and escape in all other spatial directions , but each event must be weighted with the probability for its occurrence . in fig .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : msd_pre_selection ] ) represents the diffusion process of selected particles that move only into the desired direction .",
    "their final positions after a time @xmath30 , denoted by the polar angles @xmath47 , are restricted to @xmath48 .",
    "the msds from fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](a ) are calculated with respect to different starting positions , i.e. , @xmath49 , where in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](b - d ) the particles always start at wall contact .",
    "as it is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](a ) , the effect of different starting positions has major impact on the shape of the vertical short - time msd at intermediate or high packing fractions .",
    "if the tracked particle starts inside a layer , i.e. , the maximum of the density profile ( at @xmath50 ) , it immediately feels the impact of the confining cage at this position .",
    "this fact makes it to become trapped at short and intermediate times and only jump after larger waiting times .",
    "furthermore , if a particle starts in the second layer , it is able to jump forward or backward . therefore , especially at shorter times the diffusion is enhanced by a factor of approximately @xmath51 with respect to a particle that starts in front of the wall .",
    "however , the initial trapping in the cage is still visible . at larger times ,",
    "backward jumps are restricted by the wall and the factor @xmath51 disappears .",
    "contrarily , if the starting position is in between the first two layers ( @xmath52 ) , the diffusion in @xmath5-direction is larger for short times and smaller for long times .",
    "this is due to the fact that the starting position for such a particle is less stable , because it is unfavorable to stay in between two layers .",
    "successively , when the particle relocates along the @xmath5-axis , it inevitably reaches one of the neighboring layers , where it might be caught in a cage for a typical period .",
    "since we aim to investigate the local rearrangement from one stable position to another , we will always consider particles that start at the wall in the following .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](b ) we plot the msd ( averaged over all small particles ) for a dense system with packing fraction @xmath37 for directions parallel and perpendicular to the wall in comparison with the free diffusion .",
    "the averaged curves suggest that the diffusion process in @xmath5-direction is stronger suppressed than parallel to the wall .",
    "this is because we consider the average over all particles in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](b ) .",
    "however , if only particles within the pre - selected directions are employed , the different msd look all rather akin as demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : msdcompilation](c ) .",
    "all curves approximately correspond to the curve of the diffusion along the wall from fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](b ) .",
    "this intriguing finding leads to the conclusion that the diffusion behaves similar in all spatial directions , where at the same time diffusion along the wall is more probable ( already seen from fig .  [ fig : vanhovecompilation ] ) . only because in the usual representation of the msd the displacement is weighted by the probability of the accompanied sampling in a certain direction ,",
    "a more pronounced plateau emerges when inspecting less probable directions , e.g. , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](b ) .",
    "one has to be careful with the interpretation of the above presented averages , since a particle could for example escape in a tilted direction due to the lack of a neighboring particle at that position , by chance .",
    "such events would occur in the direction where the first and second layer in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro](b ) are connected by strongly correlated regions , i.e. , along a path on which the minimal value of the total correlation function is as large as possible .",
    "note that its direction is also captured by the solid angle interval 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdcompilation](d ) .",
    "still , the above described perceptions motivate for the fact , that the escape in other directions can probably be treated in a similar way as the perpendicular escape , just with the difference that some directions are more probable than others . concerning the importance for the bulk ,",
    "the completely averaged diffusion process is probably the result of the weighted composition of the separate diffusion mechanisms in all possible directions .",
    "for this reason , we will focus on the cage escape in @xmath5-direction within our setup in the following sections .",
    "in particular , we will study the forces acting on a particle during its escape , relate the forces to collision frequencies in a hard - sphere system , and investigate the history dependence of escape paths .",
    "in this section we analyze the forces acting on a sphere that is trapped in an anisotropic cage formed by its neighboring particles .",
    "furthermore , we explore the history dependence of the dynamics during cage - breaking events .",
    "the properties studied in this section will be used as ingredients for the one - particle random - walk models proposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rw ] .          while in the previous section we focused on the preferred trajectories which trapped particles",
    "use to escape from cages , we now look for mean forces on particles during their escape . in order to explore the properties of a cage , we use the bd simulations to calculate the mean forces @xmath53 that act on the surface of a small particle .",
    "these forces arise from overlaps with neighboring particles which are located in directions denoted by the polar angle @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig : forcedistributionandcaps](a ) shows these forces averaged over a large number of configurations in a dense system with @xmath37 for various distances @xmath5 from the wall .",
    "the two very prominent peaks in all the distributions stem from the likely configurations where the small test particle is the neighbor of a small or a large sphere at the wall , respectively . as the tracked particle detaches from the wall , these peaks shift from the sides towards the bottom hemisphere ( @xmath55 ) of its surface ( if the wall is considered at the bottom of the box ) .",
    "however , from atop ( @xmath56 ) the forces become smaller .",
    "this is due to the unfavored position of a neighboring particle on top of the test particle , because particles of the second layer from the wall are usually not positioned directly on top of particles of the first layer ( cf .",
    "structural analysis in previous work @xcite ) .",
    "this explains our results of the van hove functions , where the direction perpendicular to the wall is the preferred direction for a small test particle to move .    in order to obtain the forces that a particle has to overcome in order to move in a certain direction , we average all force components acting along the opposite direction over the hemisphere of the test particle that points in the corresponding direction . to be specific",

    "the curves represent forces that a particle has to countervail in order to move into a certain direction .",
    "one can nicely see the change of the forces with the angle and the particle detachment . when a particle is close to contact ( red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcedistributionandcaps](b ) ) , the cross section force exhibits a strong minimum for the direction pointing towards the wall ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "note that the particle hardly can move into that direction due to the repulsion from the wall that is not included in the particle - particle force considerations . in the opposite direction ( @xmath56 ) a subtle",
    "local minimum occurs and there is a maximum into a tilted direction ( @xmath65 ) roughly denoting the direction towards the neighboring particles in the second layer ( compare also fig .  [",
    "fig : intro](b ) ) . as the test particle is moved away from the wall towards the middle of the first two density layers , the minimum in the direction perpendicular away from the wall ( @xmath56 ) becomes even more pronounced , whilst the maximum shifts towards the parallel direction ( see , e.g. , the cases represented by the yellow / green lines ) .    note that the cross section force can not be calculated from a one - particle density , but at least a two - body description as presented in previous work @xcite is needed , because the anisotropy of the force distribution is crucial .

    "how often such collision events occur , we analyze the distribution of the absolute value of the interaction force for our soft - sphere system where the overlapping energy is well - defined and then approach the hard - sphere limit .    the boltzmann factor for two particles of the species @xmath7 and @xmath72 with the interaction potential @xmath73",

    ", the @xmath101 limit was determined by considering the corresponding functions at a time @xmath108 which is much shorter than the rearrangement time in all systems .    intriguingly , as marked by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcehistorydependencewithz](b ) a connection between maxima of the local density ( red line ) and the magnitude of the force history ( green and blue lines ) becomes visible . whenever a local density peak emerges , the magnitude of the memory is suppressed .",
    "the opposite is true for local density minima , where the magnitude of the corresponding force memories is enhanced .",
    "this shows that when particles reside inside a local density layer , they are supposed to be more stable at this position for longer times and individually occurring forces are similar . in return , this precipitates in the average of the force memory and therefore results in a less pronounced deviation from the total average . on the other hand ,",
    "when a particle is on its way from one density maximum to another , it necessarily crosses a local minimum . on this",
    "crossing , its history has major influence on the average forces .",
    "for example , when the particle is moving in positive @xmath5-direction , it possibly leaves void space behind it , whereas in front of it a barrier of neighboring particles is blocking its path .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that at such a position the memory has a large effect on the consecutive motion .",
    "in this section , we test whether a random - walk model for a single particle can describe a cage breaking event",
    ". we will not construct a model that is just based on an escape rate like kramer s rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or on an escape rate given in an free energy landscape as detmined in @xcite but our random walks rely on the ingredients obtained in the previous section . to analyze the impact of the different ingredients , we construct random walk models where one particle in principle moves in three dimensions , though we use the models to describe the cage - breaking motion along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "we employ the diffusion coefficients as given by the temperature in order to determine the mean square of a step length and the average force profile in order to obtain a drift contribution in the case the particle is overlapping with another particle .",
    "the probability for a collision as determined from simulation data is used as an additional input in order to decide whether there is any overlap at all . in the first model ,",
    "no history - dependence is used , while in the second model we employ the memory function obtained from our simulations as an additional input .",
    "we will employ the test case , where a single small particle starts at the wall and moves towards the second layer in a perpendicular straight path .      our first random - walk model ( rw , no mem . ) does not incorporate any memory .",
    "it just employs the average force @xmath89 acting on a particle .",
    "the model consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "decide from an equally distributed random number and from the @xmath5-dependent collision probability @xmath109 , whether the particle collides with another particle .",
    "2 .   calculate a three - dimensional diffusion step @xmath110 within a time @xmath111 via a diffusion coefficient according to free diffusion and an external force in the case of a collision .",
    "according to these steps , the external force vanishes if no collision occurs , but in the case of a collision an external force @xmath112 with the following two contributions is applied : @xmath113 here , @xmath114 is the average of the absolute ( normal ) forces acting on the particles surface at a position @xmath5 .",
    "it is proportional to the local average pressure and can be calculated from the one - particle density together with the anisotropic pair correlations .",
    "the second force is the mean force , exerted by the structure of the neighboring particles . in both cases the normalization with",
    "the collision probability @xmath115 guarantees that the average force profile @xmath116 is recovered over time .",
    "our second random - walk model ( rw ) incorporates the memory of the history of the particle , namely the fact that it has started at the wall and , for this reason , is supposed to recognize the impact of the force memory @xmath117 . in this model the second force @xmath118 of the model rw , no mem .",
    "is slightly modified such that it reads @xmath119 } { p_\\text{1,coll}(z ) } , \\ ] ] where we use the fits of the force memories from eq .",
    "( [ eq : stretchedexp ] ) as an input and the respective parameters as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : historydependenceplots](b ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdrwmodel](a ) we plot the msd of small particles in @xmath5-direction for simulation data in comparison with results from our random - walk models for two different packing fractions . in case of the history - dependent model",
    "rw the respective memory times are @xmath120 for @xmath37 and @xmath121 for @xmath93 . for the simple random - walk model rw , no mem . without memory ,",
    "the curves deviate from the measured ones already at small runtime @xmath30 .",
    "the deviation is less pronounced for the dilute system , where memory is supposed to play a smaller role than for systems close to the glass transition .",
    "the model rw ( with memory ) leads to reasonable predictions with , at least , a typical rearrangement for both packing fractions .",
    "the impact of memory in our model system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : msdrwmodel](b ) , where we plot the average measured forces as a function of the particle position @xmath5 and of the runtime @xmath122 . for short runtime , the particle does not manage to hop over the first few particle layers , which results in truncated lines .",
    "however , for increasing runtime , the time - averaged forces from our random walk models converge , as expected , against @xmath123 .",
    "this mimics the loss of memory .",
    "in this work we explored the properties of a cage - breaking event in a bidisperse mixture of spheres in the vicinity of a wall .",
    "we studied the ingredients which are necessary to develop an effective one - particle random - walk description of the dynamics . by considering cages close to a wall and an escape route perpendicular to the wall",
    ", we guaranteed that errors that arise due to averaging quantities over differently oriented cages are small .",
    "we discovered that a random - walk model can describe the dynamics reasonably well if a suitable anisotropic force distribution , a collision frequency , and a memory function are used as input .",
    "while the force distribution and the collision frequency in principle can be obtained from theories on a level of two - particle structural correlations ( as studied in previous works @xcite ) , the memory of a trajectory depends on the motion of all particles in the surrounding cage . besides the memory function",
    ", no other collective motion effects had to be included . by this",
    ", we demonstrated that the memory is essential to describe the dynamics in a dense system .    in order to develop comparable random - walk models for rearrangements in bulk",
    ", one has to be careful with averages over different cage orientations . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to construct such random - walk models following three steps .",
    "first , all relevant ( probable ) cages in bulk must be identified ( cf .",
    "second , the distributions of forces must be determined for all these cage configurations in such a way that the orientation is always fixed relative to one neighboring particle .",
    "third , the average over orientations must be calculated .",
    "that way , the dynamics along the escape route and along other directions can be determined independently before taking an average instead of determining the dynamics after averaging over directions , which would correspond to the dynamics based on an isotropic mean field cage .",
    "thus , errors can be avoided which result from the fact that the averaging over directions and the determination of escape dynamics obviously do not commute .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how our approach compares to free energy landscapes of a cage @xcite or how our results can be built in or compared to the theories which employ isotropic cages , e.g. , the theory where the cage breaking event is facilitated by the elasticity of the cage @xcite or mode coupling theory @xcite .",
