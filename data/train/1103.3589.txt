    "this article is motivated by discussions of the origin of quantum mechanics , as presented , for example , in refs .",
    "these suggest that quantum mechanics could possibly _ emerge _ by coarse - graining and sufficiently far from the planck scale .",
    "thus , the quantum phenomena would arise from dynamics beneath .",
    "numerous indications exist which support this view .",
    "nevertheless , the general principles governing such hypothetical dynamics are under debate @xcite and , perhaps , have not even been touched upon , so far .    in this situation , it may be worth while to focus on aspects of quantum and classical mechanics which bring them as closely together as possible , yet sharpen remaining differences .",
    "the _ linearity _ of the respective evolution equations must certainly be counted among such aspects .",
    "indeed , it is remarkable that dynamical evolution in physics , to a large extent , can be encoded in one or the other of three linear equations : @xmath0 \\label{schroedinger }   i\\partial_t\\psi & = & \\hat h\\psi   \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{vonneumann }   i\\partial_t\\hat\\rho & = & [ \\hat h,\\hat\\rho ]   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , respectively , are the _ liouville equation _ ( [ liouville ] ) , governing the evolution of a classical phase space density @xmath1 in terms of the poisson bracket @xmath2 and the hamilton function @xmath3 of the object under study , the _ schrdinger equation _ ( [ schroedinger ] ) for the quantum mechanical wave function(al ) in terms of the appropriate hamilton operator @xmath4 , and the _ vonneumann equation _ ( [ vonneumann ] ) for the density operator @xmath5 in terms of the commutator @xmath6 $ ] with @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that all three equations pertain to ( or can be interpreted as ) ensemble theories .",
    "they have the generic structure : @xmath7 where the `` state '' appears only _ linearly _ in all cases .",
    "this first - order in time differential equation , of course , assumes widely different forms depending on the forces or dynamics under study .",
    "that is , the `` liouville superoperator '' @xmath8 on the right - hand side allows to incorporate physics ranging from classical non - relativistic single particles all the way to relativistic quantum fields , employing a phase space ensemble of initial conditions in classical statistical mechanics and the functional schrdinger picture for interacting quantum fields .    since the schrdinger equation describes special cases ( pure states ) of situations ( pure and mixed states ) covered by the vonneumann equation , we consider eqs.([liouville ] ) and ( [ vonneumann ] ) , eventually in the form of eq.([linform ] ) , in the following .",
    "in passing , we recall that _ nonlinear _ modifications of quantum mechanics have been proposed and severely constrained in various ways , see , for example , refs.@xcite .    in distinction , modifications of the linear eq.([vonneumann ] ) , in particular , have been derived for `` open systems '' or quantum mechanical objects interacting with an environment ( such as a heat bath of oscillators , etc . ) .",
    " here , one is clearly _ not _ interested in modifying quantum mechanics but in applying it to complex situations .  the generic form of the resulting _ consistent _ dynamics , replacing eq.([vonneumann ] ) while preserving the defining properties of the density operator ,",
    "is known as the _ lindblad equation _ @xcite .",
    "its generator provides an important example of a _ completely positive map_. some aspects of this will be discussed in more detail in section  4 , in order to contrast it with modifications of the linear dynamics introduced there .    a hypothetical fundamental coupling of quantum mechanical and classical degrees of freedom  _ `` hybrid dynamics '' _  instead , presents a departure from quantum mechanics . while this does not touch the linearity , in the sense of eq.([linform ] ) , consistency of the resulting theory has to be carefully examined .",
    "we remark that there is also a practical interest in certain forms of hybrid dynamics .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation , for example , is based on a separation of interacting slow and fast degrees of freedom of a compound object .",
    "the former are treated as approximately classical while the latter as of quantum mechanical nature .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that in these cases , hybrid dynamics is considered as relevant _ approximate description _ of an intrinsically quantum mechanical object .",
    "this has recently been employed , for example , in a re - derivation of geometric forces and berry s phase @xcite .",
    "such considerations are and will become increasingly important for precise manipulations of quantum mechanical objects by apparently , for all practical purposes classical means , especially in ( sub-)nanotechnological devices .    however , this may be also relevant for studies of the _ measurement problem _ : namely , quantum theory , endowed with the copenhagen interpretation , _ assumes _ a coupling of the quantum mechanical object to the classical measuring ( or manipulating ) apparatus .",
    "however , it remains profoundly silent about _ how _ this is realized and how the ensuing state reduction ( `` collapse of the wave function '' ) proceeds .",
    " truly hybrid dynamics , which does not arise from an approximation , augmented by effects of environment induced decoherence and anharmonic forces , must have something to say about measurement situations , if it can be formulated consistently .    presently , we are motivated by interest in the _ back - reaction _ effect of quantum fluctuations on classical degrees of freedom , in particular if they are physically distinct .",
    "we recall here especially discussions of the `` semiclassical '' einstein equation coupling the classical metric of spacetime to the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor of quantized matter fields .",
    "can this be made into a consistent hybrid theory leaving gravity unquantized ? this has recently been re - examined in ref.@xcite ; earlier related work includes refs.@xcite .",
    "concerning the origin of quantum mechanics from a coarse - grained deterministic dynamics @xcite , to which we alluded above , the back - reaction problem can be more provocatively stated as the problem of the interplay of fluctuations among underlying deterministic and emergent quantum mechanical degrees of freedom . or , in short : _ `` can quantum mechanics be seeded ? '' _    in this paper , we present a few ingredients which may be helpful in further studies of these questions .  in the following section  2 , we begin with a brief recapitulation of our path integral formulation of classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "some simple observations following from this lead us to take up the subject of hybrid dynamics in section  3 . in section  4 , we continue the discussion from a different angle , namely with some remarks on problems encountered when trying to embed classical or quantum mechanics in a more general linear dynamics .",
    "our aim here is to solve the liouville equation ( [ liouville ] ) with the help of a suitable propagator which , in turn , is represented as a path integral .",
    "we summarize essential steps , while more details of the derivation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the following considerations are rather independent of the number of degrees of freedom and apply to matrix or grassmann valued variables as well ; field theories require a classical functional formalism , which has been considered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system , for simplicity .",
    "we assume conservative forces acting on the classical object under study and that hamilton s equations are determined by the generic hamiltonian function : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote generalized coordinate and momentum , respectively , and where @xmath12 stands for an external potential ( a mass parameter will be inserted later ) .",
    "an ensemble of such objects can be described by a probability distribution function @xmath1 depending on the @xmath13-coordinates of phase space and time .",
    "such a distribution evolves according to the _ liouville equation _ : @xmath14 with @xmath15 . ",
    "the relative minus sign in the poisson bracket , or between terms here , reflects the symplectic phase space symmetry",
    ". it will give rise to a commutator structure , which reminds one of quantum mechanics , as we shall see momentarily .",
    "following a fourier transformation , @xmath16 , and a transformation of the effectively _ doubled number of spacelike coordinates _",
    ", @xmath17 the liouville equation becomes : @xmath18 \\label{hx }   \\hat h_\\chi & : = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\chi ^{\\;2}+v(\\chi ) \\;\\ ; ,   \\;\\;\\;\\mbox{for}\\;\\;\\chi = q , q   \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{i }   { \\cal e}(q , q)&:=&(q - q)v'(\\frac{q+q}{2 } ) -v(q)+v(q)\\;=\\;-{\\cal e}(q , q ) \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , it bears strong resemblance to the _ vonneumann equation _ , cf .",
    "eq.([vonneumann ] ) , considering @xmath19 as matrix elements of a density operator @xmath20 .",
    "we automatically recover the hamiltonian operator @xmath4 related to the hamiltonian function , eq.([hamiltonianf ] ) , as in quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , reality and normalization of the phase space probability distribution @xmath21 translate into hermiticity and trace normalization of the density operator @xmath20 @xcite .    however , an essential dynamical feature here consists in the interaction @xmath22 between _",
    "bra- _ and _ ket-_states .",
    "thus , generally , the hilbert space and its dual are coupled by a genuine _ superoperator _ , a concept to be defined in the following subsection .",
    "is antisymmetric under @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that the complete liouville superoperator on the right - hand side of eq.([schroed ] ) , to be compared with eq.([linform ] ) , has a symmetric spectrum with respect to zero and , in general , will not be bounded below .",
    "related observations were discussed , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "it is remarkable that the interaction between bra- and ket - states vanishes under certain circumstances : @xmath24 rendering a liouville superoperator of quantum mechanical form , i.e. , as in eq.([vonneumann ] ) .   in a field theory",
    "amounts to having massive or massless free fields , with or without external sources , and with or without bilinear couplings . in these cases , anharmonic forces or interactions",
    "are absent . ]",
    "this has been discussed in ref.@xcite under the perspective of having quantum phenomena emerge due to discrete spacetime structure .    in the following",
    ", we will study in more detail the classical dynamics described by eq.([schroed ] ) , or by appropriate generalizations , and pay particular attention to the presence of the superoperator @xmath22 , when comparing with the vonneumann equation and its solution by a propagator .",
    "the dynamics of density operators in the general form of eq.([linform ] ) can be conveniently rewritten by introducing the concept of _ superspace _ , also called _ liouville space _ @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 denote a hamiltonian operator , as in quantum theory , and let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , present a complete orthonormal set of basis states , assuming here that the relevant hilbert space is @xmath28-dimensional .",
    "then , the matrix elements of the vonneumann equation ( [ vonneumann ] ) read : @xmath29\\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\ ;    j , k = 1,2,\\dots , n \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with a density matrix @xmath1 of @xmath30 elements . or , written as in eq.([linform ] ) :",
    "@xmath31 where the _ liouville superoperator _ @xmath32 is now defined by its matrix elements : @xmath33 this simple rewriting may suggest to introduce a space in which the density operator is a vector .",
    "this is the role of the liouville space ( or superspace ) .",
    "the dynamics of density operators can then be described in parallel for classical and quantum mechanics . in general , they will differ , of course , by the precise form of the superoperator , examples of which we have seen here and in the previous subsection .    given the hilbert space , as above , the density operator can be expanded as : @xmath34 the family of @xmath30 operators @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , can be interpreted as a complete set of matrices , or vectors , such that the density operator becomes : @xmath37 where the `` ket '' @xmath38 denotes the liouville space _ vector _ representing the hilbert space _ operator _ @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , we introduce a `` bra''-vector @xmath39 as the hermitian conjugate of @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , any operator @xmath40 is represented by a vector , denoted by @xmath41 , and can be expanded as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the usual matrix elements @xmath44 .",
    " furthermore , with a bra - vector @xmath45 representing @xmath46 , the scalar product of two operators is defined by : @xmath47 this implies the orthonormality condition : @xmath48 in analogy to and based on @xmath49 .",
    " finally , consider the scalar product : @xmath50 upon substitution in eq.([opex ] ) , this yields : @xmath51 this is consistent with the following completeness relation in liouville space : @xmath52 it is easy to see now that the liouville space is a linear space and that the density operator @xmath53 , in particular , is a vector in this space .  to conclude these formal considerations , we define a linear operator in terms of its matrix elements : @xmath54 an example of which is given in eq.([lvn ] ) .",
    "the importance of liouville space for classical _ and _ quantum dynamics resides in that liouville and vonneumann equations , both , assume the form of eq.([linform ] ) , incorporating an appropriate superoperator @xmath32 , cf .",
    "eqs.([schroed])([i ] ) and ( [ vn]) (    [ lvn ] ) , respectively .",
    "thus , we find a close formal similarity between the structure of these equations and the schrdinger equation ( [ schroedinger ] ) .    therefore , it is plausible that formal derivations or techniques concerning the solution of the schrdinger equation can be transferred to the cases of liouville or vonneumann equations with the help of liouville space notions .",
    "this regards perturbation theory as much as nonperturbative methods , the path integral approach in particular , to which we turn next .",
    "the technical ingredients of the feynman path integral approach , for the derivation of quantum mechanical propagators in particular , are very well known @xcite .",
    "we will make use of these ideas , in order to derive a path integral for the propagator of density matrices based on the liouville space formulation of the preceding subsection .",
    "our derivation relies on the close formal similarity between the classical liouville equation and the vonneumann equation on one hand side and the schrdinger equation on the other , in the appropriate representation that we discussed .   explicitly . ]    in particular , the formal solutions of the classical liouville equation and of the quantum mechanical vonneumann equation , both , can be written in the form : @xmath55 where @xmath32 is the relevant liouville superoperator . here",
    ", we have : @xmath56 where @xmath4 denotes the appropriate hamilton operator in coordinate representation , as indicated , which alone is relevant for the vonneumann equation , while @xmath22 represents the additionally present superoperator term for classical dynamics , cf .",
    "subsection2.1 .    in order to solve the problem of time evolution in the present case",
    ", we need to know the ( super)matrix elements entering the propagation equation : @xmath57 in analogy to the case of a state vector evolving according the schrdinger equation .",
    "not surprisingly , we can now follow the usual steps @xcite , in order to construct the path integral representation of our propagator @xcite .    in this derivation",
    ", one has to pay attention to a suitable generalization of the trotter product formula .",
    "this works out in a straightforward way ; the relevant definitions and details of the proof are given in ref.@xcite .    rewriting the eq.([rhoprop ] ) as : @xmath58 our interest is to know the _ superpropagator _",
    "@xmath59 .    following the recipe to arrive at a path integral representation ,",
    "we make use here of suitably inserted complete sets of superspace vectors , such as : @xmath60 and , correspondingly , for momentum space , cf .",
    "eq.([completeness ] ) . using the plane wave relation between coordinate and momentum eigenfunctions ,",
    "we also employ : @xmath61 furthermore , the orthogonality relation @xmath62 , cf .",
    "eq.([orthogonality ] ) , implies : @xmath63 then , with all following steps of the derivation in parallel with the usual ones , it is straightforward to obtain the _ liouville path integral _",
    "@xcite : @xmath64\\big )   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , otherwise unrestricted paths , and with the _ superaction _",
    "@xmath69 defined by : @xmath70   \\label{superaction1 }   { \\cal s}:=\\int_{t_0}^t\\mbox{d}\\tau\\;\\big ( { \\textstyle \\frac{m}{2}}\\dot q^2-v(q ) -\\big ( { \\textstyle \\frac{m}{2}}\\dot q^2-v(q)\\big ) -{\\cal e}(q , q)\\big ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] for a particle of mass @xmath71 .",
    "we recall that @xmath72 corresponds to evolution according to the vonneumann equation , whereas @xmath73 represents the _ only _ modification due to classical dynamics , in accordance with the liouville equation , cf .",
    "eqs.([schroed])([i ] ) .",
    "however simple this result may seem , the eqs.([superpropagator])([superaction1 ] ) describe time evolution of the full density matrix .",
    "the particular new feature is that formally _",
    "classical dynamics is treated on the same footing as quantum mechanics _ , differing only in the action entering the phase in the integrand of the path integral .",
    "these considerations are limited neither by one dimension nor by single - particle physics , but can be extended all the way to relativistic field theories .",
    "this offers new calculational tools , new approximation methods in particular , and may be of interest for applications in classical statistical mechanics . in the following , however , we turn to the quantum - classical divide .",
    "first of all , it seems worth while to record a few simple properties of the liouvile path integral .",
    "we observe that in the absence of forces , @xmath74 , the classical and quantum mechanical propagators _ coincide _ , according to eqs.([superpropagator])([superaction1 ] ) . which implies that classical and quantum mechanical behaviour can differ at most in the initial states that are being propagated , in this case .",
    " this holds true even for @xmath75 , if @xmath72 , i.e. , for harmonic forces , cf .",
    "( [ ezero ] ) . ",
    "thus , the cherished `` textbook effect '' of the _ spreading of wave packets _ is not a peculiar ( kinematical ) quantum effect , but rather an effect of the particular states considered !",
    "a simple calculation , taking into account our above transformations from @xmath13- to @xmath76-coordinates ( and back ) , shows that a _ classical point particle _ with initial phase space distribution @xmath77 is propagated to the distribution @xmath78 , i.e. along a straight line path , as expected .  instead , a free gaussian wave packet in @xmath76-space spreads in the way described in textbooks on quantum mechanics .    finally , we can convince ourselves that the classical dynamics is properly represented by the liouville propagator , in general , by undoing the coordinate transformations ( [ coordtrans ] ) directly in the path integral representation of the superpropagator : @xmath79 a transformation with unit jacobian . following a partial integration of the superaction , the path integral over the @xmath80-coordinate simply yields a functional @xmath81-``function '' and results in : @xmath82\\;\\mbox{exp}(-im\\dot x_iy_i )   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions",
    "@xmath83 , similarly for the velocities , and where @xmath84 denote the initial and final values of the @xmath80-variable , respectively .",
    "the phase factors stem from the partial integration of the superaction .",
    "thus , we find the expected result that only paths following solutions of the _ classical _ equations of motion contribute to the propagator .",
    "the role of the phase factors is easily understood by recalling eq.([rhoprop1 ] ) : after the inverse coordinate transformations ( [ coordtransinverse ] ) , one of the two ordinary integrations there becomes here , including the relevant ( initial ) phase factor : @xmath85 i.e. , this incorporates the inverse fourier transformation , back to the momentum variable of phase space .",
    "the second ( final ) phase factor , then , is necessary for the propagator to fulfil the important semi - group property @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the path integral for the propagator of the classical liouville equation shows significant similarity with the propagator of the quantum mechanical vonneumann equation .",
    "this suggests a new perspective on _ hybrid dynamics _  the hypothetical direct coupling of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that we discussed in section1 .",
    "in particular , we are interested here in the propagator for the density matrix of a bi - partite system , composed of a classical and a quantum mechanical particle of masses @xmath86 in external potentials @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the relevant coordinates will be denoted by @xmath76 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "our previous considerations lead us to propose the following _ hybrid superpropagator _",
    "eq.([superpropagator ] ) ) : @xmath89\\big )   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where the superaction naturally consists of three contributions , @xmath90 : @xmath91 \\label{sqm } { \\cal s}_{\\mbox{qm}}&:=&\\int_{t_0}^t\\mbox{d}\\tau\\;\\big ( { \\textstyle \\frac{m}{2}}\\big ( \\dot q'^2-\\dot q'^2\\big ) -\\big ( v(q')-v(q')\\big )   \\big ) \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{sh } { \\cal s}_{\\mbox{h}}&:=&-\\int_{t_0}^t\\mbox{d}\\tau\\ ; { \\cal v}(q , q;q',q ' )   \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] several remarks are in order here .",
    "the contribution @xmath92 is the classical superaction arrived at in eqs.([superpropagator])([superaction1 ] ) ; we just inserted @xmath22 , eq.([i ] ) , explicitly and collected terms .",
    "correspondingly , the contribution @xmath93 is the action for the propagator of the vonneumann equation , i.e. , it describes the quantum mechanical particle in the usual way .",
    "thus , in the absence of the interaction term @xmath94 , the hybrid superpropagator @xmath95 factorizes into the corresponding ones for liouville and vonneumann equations . this would consistently describe a composite system of two independent , classical and quantum mechanical particles .",
    "the interaction term @xmath94 introduces the coupling responsible for _ hybrid dynamics_.  for our present purposes , we restrict this coupling by two consistency requirements :   + ( * a * ) @xmath96 describes a classical particle interacting with another particle ( coordinates @xmath88 ) , as if the latter were _ classical _ ; + ( * b * ) @xmath97describes a quantum mechanical particle interacting with another particle ( coordinates @xmath76 ) , as if the latter were _ quantum mechanical_.    in view of the general form of the external potential terms in eqs.([scl ] ) and ( [ sqm ] ) , these conditions can only be fulfilled , if @xmath98 is _ harmonic _ , i.e. , is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to two in all variables .",
    "thus , the hybrid coupling is of a form that admits a classical or quantum mechanical interpretation , depending on whether it is viewed from the classical or quantum mechanical subsystem .",
    "an example is provided by a distance dependent oscillator potential , @xmath99 . following the derivation of the classical superpropagator ,",
    "this becomes , in the above coordinates : @xmath100 \\label{clqm } & = & ( q - q)(q+q)+(q'-q')(q'+q')^2 - 2(qq'-qq ' ) \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , it can be seen as coupling between two classical particles , fulfilling condition ( * a * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the separable oscillator terms here also equal @xmath101 , i.e. , are of quantum mechanical form , in accordance with ( [ ezero ] ) , and the bilinear coupling can as well be seen as quantum mechanical , fulfilling condition ( * b * ) .",
    "interesting consequences of these conditions , determining a _ harmonic hybrid interaction _ , are summarized in the following table : +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.2 cm indicated are the nature of the potentials acting on the classical and quantum mechanical particles and their interaction , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively  h : harmonic ; anh : anharmonic  and the character of the resulting hybrid dynamics ",
    "cl : classical ; qm : quantum mechanical . 0.25 cm for example , if the classical and quantum mechanical particles are governed by a harmonic potential and an anharmonic potential , respectively , then the resulting dynamics of the composite system can be considered as that of two bilinearly coupled quantum mechanical particles , one of which moves in a harmonic potential . ",
    "the case of both potentials being anharmonic is most interesting .",
    "however , no general statements can be made in this case without further study .",
    "the quantum mechanical or classical behaviour of the composite system might very well depend on _ where _ ( concerning its variables ) one is looking at this object !",
    "there is a _ qualitative difference between cl and qm _ , contained in the full path integral for the superpropagator , eqs.([hsuperpropagator])([sh ] ) .",
    "following standard arguments which lead back from a path integral to an equivalent equation of motion for the ( hybrid ) density operator @xmath5 , several related observations may be interesting .",
    "the qm evolution is generated by a commutator of the hamiltonian with the density operator .",
    "generally , this superposes and , for multi - partite systems , in particular , entangles underlying bra- and ket - states separately , @xmath105 ( using a convenient notation with discrete indices ) . for a bi - partite system , it is revealing to write the relevant interaction terms explicitly : @xmath106=\\hat h_1\\hat\\rho_1\\otimes\\hat h_2\\hat\\rho_2-\\hat\\rho_1\\hat h_1   \\otimes\\hat\\rho_2\\hat h_2   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] for an interaction @xmath107 , with the factors acting on subsystems `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' , respectively , and where @xmath108 , for a separable initial state .",
    "this has been called _ dynamically assisted entanglement generation _ , see , for example , refs .  @xcite .",
    "it may come as a surprise that the cl evolution does this just as well , due to the structure of the superoperator .",
    "for polynomial interactions , in particular , the superoperator _ always _ contains a contribution proportional to the usual qm terms .",
    "however , the cl evolution , generally , produces additional correlations in @xmath5 , due to terms contained in @xmath109 which _",
    "entangle bra- and ket - states_.  in comparison with eq.([qmentangle ] ) , such terms can have the unfamiliar structure : @xmath110 which differs decidedly from a commutator .",
    " this leads us to distinguish _",
    "( i.e. , within given tensor product hilbert space of subsystems `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ) and _ inter - space entanglement _",
    "( i.e. , between said hilbert space and its dual ) .",
    "consider , for example , the anharmonic potential @xmath111 for a bi - partite system consisting of particles `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' .",
    "similarly as before , this leads here to the interaction : @xmath112 in terms of , by now , familiar variables , taking into account subsystems `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' with @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s refering to bra- and ket - states , respectively .",
    "besides separable terms , @xmath115 , there are terms which mix ( and entangle ) variables of both subsystems , as usual in qm .",
    "however , there are also additional terms that refer to hilbert space and its dual simultaneously ( and entangle corresponding states ) , for example , @xmath116 .    in retrospect , somehow , such difference between cl and qm evolution had to be expected : instead with superstates @xmath117",
    ", we could have worked with superstates @xmath118 , relating to coordinates and momenta of the classical theory .",
    "there , coordinates and momenta end up tightly correlated , due to hamilton s equations , and produce inter - space entanglement in an interacting bi - partite system .",
    "thus , the confrontation of cl with qm , as in our side - by - side study , is quite revealing . in particular , we speculate that this opens new views on generating entanglement in multipartite systems , perhaps , by evolving through quasiclassical stages or by making use of decohered intermediary states .",
    "concerning the quantum - classical divide , the present analysis shows that there is an appealing , if not puzzling formal similarity between cl and qm .",
    "however , this demonstrates one more time that what has been discussed in various ways as cl limit of qm  and which is similarly relevant for `` emergent qm ''  deserves further study .    while our work has been concerned mainly with the evolution of cl or qm objects , we recall that v.i.manko and collaborators have pointed out that classical states may differ widely from what could be obtained as the `` @xmath119 '' limit of quantum mechanical ones .",
    "they show that all states can be classified by their ` tomograms ' as _ either _ cl _ or _ qm , cl _ and _ qm , and _ neither _ cl _ nor _ qm  @xcite .    the classical limit can be considered a limit `` _",
    "f_or_a_ll_p_ractical_p_urposes '' , gradually approached with decoherence as an essential but insufficient ingredient or , formally , following the mnemonic `` @xmath119 '' rule .",
    "however , in order to truly bridge the qualitative difference between intra- and inter - space entanglement that we find , and explain the `` manko classes of states '' , some unknown dynamics seems missing .",
    "the problems discussed here lead us to the question : `` does the @xmath119 deformation of qm provide the only _ interesting linear dynamics _ besides qm itself ? ''",
    "we are interested here once more in the structure of the linear evolution equations that we have discussed side by side , namely the classical liouville equation and the vonneumann equation of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , we consider this with respect to a hypothetical most _ general linear dynamics _ that can be represented in the generic form of eq.([linform ] ) : @xmath120 where the indices ( @xmath121 ) refer to a discrete , finite dimensional hilbert space , which we assume for simplicity .",
    "thus , generally , there are @xmath122 complex coefficients to be specified . imposing the _ constraint _ that the ` density matrix ' is and remains hermitian , which requires that @xmath123 , the set of coefficients can be specified by @xmath124 _ real parameters_.",
    "this should be compared with the vonneumann equation  which we discussed , in order to introduce the concept of a superoperator , cf .",

    "the matrix elements of which are specified by @xmath30 _ real parameters _ , the corresponding superoperator has been obtained as : @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , we can write a symbolic relation , concerning the number of real parameters which determine the respective dynamical equation : @xmath126 i.e. , the number of real parameters entering the quantum mechanical evolution law ( qm ) scales with the hilbert space dimension like the square root of the corresponding number for the most general linear dynamics ( gl ) which preserves hermiticity . by choosing the eigenstates of the hamiltonian as basis of the hilbert space",
    ", the number of relevant parameters in qm could be further reduced to @xmath28 , the number of real eigenvalues of @xmath4 .",
    "we may wonder whether the commutator in eq.([vn ] ) , @xmath127 $ ] , presents the _ minimal structure _ preserving hermiticity , normalization , and positivity of the density matrix .",
    "conversely , can the different numbers of real parameters between a more general linear evolution law and qm be attributed to an _ attractor mechanism _ or _ information loss _ if and when qm is emergent @xcite ?    as a first step to investigate these issues , we consider here whether qm admits a more general linear evolution .",
    " we recall the following result for the qm of _ open systems _ , see ref.@xcite and references there :    * if and only if the liouville superoperator @xmath8 entering the right - hand side of eq.([linform1 ] ) generates a _",
    "hermitian , trace preserving _ , _ completely positive map",
    "_ , @xmath128 , then it can be written in canonical _",
    "kraus form _ : @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "* such a map @xmath131 applied to a hermitian , positive semidefinite , normalized density operator yields another one and linear maps beween density operators can be written in kraus form .",
    "an evolution equation corresponding to such a map , in general , contains the vonneumann equation as a special case .",
    " in fact , the solution of the vonneumann equation ( [ vn ] ) is provided by a unitary transformation , @xmath132 , which presents the simplest case with only one unitary kraus operator , @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , any generalization which maintains the defining properties of density operators , generally , will need additional kraus operators specified by additonal parameters .",
    " in this sense , the commutator defining the vonneumann equation presents the _ minimal structure _ indeed .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the dynamics generated by @xmath134 of the kraus form , in general , is equivalent to a non - unitary reduced dynamics of a unitary dynamics on a bigger ( tensor product ) hilbert space `` @xmath135ystem@xmath136nvironment '' @xcite : @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "hence , we learn :    * hermitian , trace preserving , completely positive maps , while generalizing the vonneumann dynamics , are _ not _ general enough to `` leave qm '' .",
    "they describe the qm of _ open systems_.    however , this kind of maps does _ not _ exhaust the larger set of maps generated by all possible liouville superoperators .",
    "we conclude that one can not `` leave qm '' by invoking _ more general linear dynamics than that generated by trace preserving , completely positive maps _ without affecting properties and interpretation of the states represented by density matrices .",
    "it is useful to recall here ( the motivation behind ) the assumptions made concerning the properties and interpretation of density operators . ",
    "a density operator @xmath5 is required to be * i ) * _ hermitian _ ,",
    "i.e. , to have real eigenvalues , in order to qualify as an observable .",
    "this is needed , in turn , if one requires @xmath5 to be * ii ) * _ positive - semidefinite _ and * iii ) * _ normalized_. all three properties , together , are necessary assumptions for the standard probability interpretation of the eigenvalues of a density matrix , according to the born rule .",
    "a recurrent theme , when comparing quantum with classical states , for example , with the help of the wigner ( function ) transform of the density matrix , is the appearance of negative eigenvalues or _",
    "`` negative probabilities''_. numerous attempts have been made to give a satisfactory physical interpretation and mathematically consistent definition to these , see refs.@xcite and further references there .    instead of entering this discussion , we look at the arguably simplest example of _ general linear dynamics _ in the following .",
    "this is obtained by giving up the requirement * ii ) * above , i.e. , by abandoning positivity , and by considering a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "a convenient parametrization of the most general liouville superoperator @xmath8 for a two - dimensional state space can be written with the help of the pauli matrices @xmath140 .",
    "thus , the ( super)matrix elements @xmath141 , @xmath142 , are defined by : @xmath143 where a summation over repeated indices is understood ; in this notation we have @xmath144 .",
    "hermiticity requires @xmath145 .",
    "generally , three vectors @xmath146 are needed .",
    "furthermore , we define : @xmath147 i.e. , where @xmath148 is a hermitian @xmath139 matrix .",
    "this ansatz saturates the expected number of @xmath149 real parameters , since @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath148 contribute 3 , 9 , and 4 parameters , respectively . in order that the map generated by @xmath32 be trace preserving , we must have @xmath152 , for all @xmath5 , which leads to @xmath153 .",
    "this yields four real constraints , @xmath154 \\label{c2 }   2a\\cdot\\mbox{re}{\\cal g}\\cdot\\vec b+ig_{ij}\\vec b_i\\times\\vec b_j&\\stackrel{!}{=}&0   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduce the number of available real parameters to twelve .",
    "next , we conveniently choose the vectors @xmath155 to form a right - handed orthogonal system ; with respect to suitable coordinates , this sets six vector components to zero .",
    "thus , we are left with six real parameters , three of which could characterize the qm evolution of a two - state object , while three pertain to the generalization we are concerned with .    finally , we assume for simplicity that the ` qm part ' of @xmath32 is diagonal , corresponding to a spin-1/2 particle in a constant external magnetic field parallel to the quantization axis , for example .",
    "setting one of the remaining parameters to zero , we obtain a simplified model with altogether three real parameters , @xmath156 : @xmath157   & \\;&+\\beta\\gamma\\big\\{\\langle i|\\sigma_z|k\\rangle\\langle l|\\sigma_x|j\\rangle -\\langle i|\\sigma_x|k\\rangle\\langle l|\\sigma_z|j\\rangle\\big\\ }   + i\\beta\\gamma\\big\\{\\langle i|\\sigma_y|k\\rangle\\delta_{lj }   + \\delta_{ik}\\langle l|\\sigma_y|j\\rangle\\big\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{lsimp } & \\;&+i\\beta^2\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{lj } + i\\gamma^2\\langle i|\\sigma_y|k\\rangle\\langle l|\\sigma_y|j\\rangle -i(\\beta^2+\\gamma^2)\\langle i|\\sigma_z|k\\rangle\\langle l|\\sigma_z|j\\rangle \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where qm terms @xmath158 feature in the first line .",
    "all other contributions on the right - hand side have no counterpart in qm ; this will become obvious by explicitly solving the model .",
    "the first two terms in the second line and the two last ones in the third couple bra- and ket - states , which we discussed as a consequence of classical evolution in sections  2.1 and 3.1 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the generator @xmath159 is hermitian and trace preserving , as it should .",
    "taking hermiticity and trace normalization of the density matrix into account by : @xmath160 we write the resulting evolution equation explicitly : @xmath161 \\nonumber   & \\;&\\left ( \\begin{array}{cc }   i\\gamma^2(1 - 2\\rho_{11 } ) & 2\\beta\\gamma + ( 2\\alpha + i[2\\beta^2 + \\gamma^2])\\rho_{12 } -i\\gamma^2\\rho_{12}^\\ast \\\\    -2\\beta\\gamma -(2\\alpha -i[2\\beta^2 + \\gamma^2])\\rho_{12}^\\ast   -i\\gamma^2\\rho_{12 } & -i\\gamma^2(1 - 2\\rho_{11 } )   \\end{array } \\right ) . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for @xmath162 , we recover the vonneumann equation , e.g. , for a spin-1/2 particle in a constant magnetic field .",
    "in this case , besides the hamiltonian , @xmath163 , also the total spin - squared @xmath164 is a constant of motion .",
    "we remark that if a constant operator , @xmath165 , obeys @xmath166 , for all solutions @xmath5 of the general linear evolution equation ( [ linform1 ] ) , then @xmath167 , which generalizes the vanishing of the commutator @xmath168_{lk}$ ] in qm , for constants of motion .",
    "this is fulfilled for any @xmath169 , with constant @xmath170 , due to the preservation of the trace normalization of the density matrix , incorporated by @xmath171 .",
    "however , this raises also the interesting question , whether there exist conserved superoperators , @xmath172 , which can be defined by the vanishing supercommutator : @xmath173_{ij , mn}:=q_{ij , kl}{\\cal l}_{kl , mn}-{\\cal l}_{ij , kl}q_{kl , mn } \\stackrel{!}{=}0   \\;\\;.\\ ] ] in the present case , this amounts to a @xmath174 matrix equation , to be studied .",
    "we now turn to the explicit solution of eq.([glevol ] ) , which can be represented as follows .",

    ", is of second order ; it decouples into two first order equations in the limit @xmath177 , independently of the value of @xmath178 . ]",
    "the remaining constants are defined by : @xmath179 \\label{omega } \\omega_\\pm&:=&2\\beta^2+\\gamma^2 \\pm 2i\\alpha ( 1-\\gamma^4/4\\alpha^2)^{1/2 }   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we may choose @xmath180 . diagonalizing the resulting traceless hermitian density matrix , we obtain the eigenvalues : @xmath181 with @xmath182 given by eqs.([rho12])([omega ] ) .",
    "several features of the solutions of our model seem unexpected .  to begin with , for @xmath162 , we obtain : @xmath183 \\label{rho12s } \\rho_{12}(t)=\\rho_{21}^\\ast ( t)&= &   r_+\\mbox{e}^{2i\\alpha t}+r_-\\mbox{e}^{-2i\\alpha t }    \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which amounts to the usual qm solution only , if we choose @xmath184 . from a qm perspective ,",
    "the _ larger set of solutions _ , parametrized by a larger set of initial conditions , is quite surprising .",
    "it leads to time dependent ` probabilities ' , if we try to interpret the eigenvalues of @xmath5 in the usual way : @xmath185 while these ` probabilities ' are real and normalized , by construction of our model , they might temporarily fall outside the interval @xmath186 $ ] , depending on the parameters @xmath187 .",
    "this remark applies also for the general case , with @xmath188 , where amplitudes grow @xmath189 , see eqs.([rho12]),([omega ] ) .",

    " opens the possibility of a larger state space , reflected in a doubling of the number of degrees of freedom_.     we emphasize that the qm evolution becomes exponentially unstable when such perturbation is introduced .",
