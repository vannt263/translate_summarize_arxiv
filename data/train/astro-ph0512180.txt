    "the x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath0 ) relation of galaxy clusters is one of the most fundamental parameter correlations , established from previous x - ray observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the x - ray luminosity reflects temperature and density profiles of hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , the @xmath0 relation should contain information on physical status and evolution of the icm .",
    "observationally , the correlation is well approximated with a power - law function : @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , it shows a significant scatter around the mean power - law relation and little redshift evolution . on the other hand , the self - similar model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicts @xmath16 .",
    "thus the inconsistency between the observations and the simple theoretical model has been debated for many years and various possibilities including non - gravitational heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dependence of gas mass or gas - mass fraction on the temperature have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , hydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the effect of radiative cooling plays an important role to reproduce the observed @xmath17 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they also suggested a further requirement of significant non - gravitational heating mechanism so as to account for the observed gas - mass fraction , however , the physical origin of the additional heating is yet to be understood .    under the virial theorem and the isothermal @xmath1-model @xcite ,",
    "an icm temperature @xmath18 is proportional to a virial temperature , @xmath19 , and differs by a factor of @xmath1 , @xmath20 .",
    "however , since @xmath18 is usually an emission - weighted temperature measured from x - ray spectroscopy and strongly reflects the temperature of the cluster core region , a temperature decrease due to radiative cooling may have much influence on the @xmath18 measurement .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "spectroscopy of central region of clusters particularly with cd galaxy provided important results that cool emission from the core is systematically less luminous than that estimated in the past mainly on the basis of imaging observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after the advent of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ x - ray satellites , more detailed temperature profiles have been measured for nearby ` cooling - flow ' clusters , which typically show central temperature decrement by a factor of @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these facts gave a piece of evidence against the standard cooling - flow model @xcite , which triggered explorations of a variety of new scenarios for gas heating : heat conduction from outer hot layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , agn heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic reconnections @xcite , tsunami @xcite etc .",
    "recently @xcite proposed a quasi - hydrostatic model for cluster gas under radiative cooling , which predicts a characteristic temperature profile with an asymptotic temperature for the central region being @xmath22 of the non - cooling outer region .",
    "their calculation agrees well with that observed in the cooling - flow clusters .",
    "if the ` universal ' temperature profile emerges in all or a fraction of clusters with short cooling timescales , the effect of temperature drop should be properly taken into account in the discussion of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "another point is due to a connection of the @xmath0 relation to the cluster core sizes .",
    "@xcite found based on the x - ray data analysis of 79 distant clusters with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ that the distribution of the cluster core radius shows two distinct peaks at @xmath23  kpc and @xmath24  kpc for @xmath25 .",
    "when dividing the sample into two subgroups corresponding to the two peaks , they show a significant difference in the normalization factor of the @xmath0 relation . some possibilities",
    "have been discussed to understand the origin of the double - peaked distribution @xcite , however , it is yet to be clarified . as long as",
    "one rely on the hydrostatic equilibrium and the isothermal @xmath1-model , their result may indicate that underlying dark matter distribution is likely to have two preferable scales of 50 kpc and 200 kpc . on the other hand",
    ", it is also found that the core radius is tightly related to the radiative cooling timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the core structure might largely be a result of the thermal evolution of the icm .    in this paper",
    ", using a large number of _ rosat _ and _ asca _ clusters compiled by @xcite , we investigate correlations between the fundamental cluster parameters . since _",
    "asca _ has a high sensitivity to measure the x - ray spectrum in the wide energy band while _ rosat _ is good at imaging in the soft x - ray band , the two observatories are an excellent combination to study properties of the intracluster medium . at present the _ xmm - newton _ and the _ chandra _ satellites are in orbit and generate much cluster data with higher sensitivities .",
    "however , the data set used in the present paper will be one of the best existing to construct the largest sample of distant clusters and study global x - ray structures . while @xcite mainly focused on the discovery of the typical two core sizes based on the analysis of 79 distant clusters with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ , @xcite described the uniform analysis , and showed the x - ray parameters for the individual clusters and the results on scaling relations .",
    "the present paper addresses the @xmath0 relation in more detail , which is organized as below . in   [ sec : sample ] , the sample and parameter estimation are described . in   [ sec : lx - t_density ] , we show gas density profiles of the sample and how they are related to a scatter about the @xmath26 relation . since redshift evolution is not clearly seen in the present distant sample and our analysis is based on a conventional @xmath1-model , a study of redshift evolution in the @xmath0 relation is beyond the scope of the present paper . in ",

    "we use @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the quoted parameter errors are the 90% confidence range throughout the paper unless otherwise noted .",
    "the @xmath30 error bars are plotted in all figures .",
    "the sample is selected from an x - ray catalogue of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ distant clusters presented in @xcite .",
    "though the original catalogue includes 79 clusters in the redshift range of @xmath31 , the final sample used in this work comprises 69 clusters in @xmath32 in order to reduce possible selection effect and measurement uncertainties which are more serious at higher redshifts , as detailed below .",
    "because the sample was collected from the archival data of the pointing observations , in order to reduce the selection effect that is not negligible at higher redshift , we exclude 5 high - redshift clusters with large measurement uncertainties from the @xcite sample : they are # 75 , # 76 , # 77 , # 78 , # 79 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we exclude # 71 and # 76 due to possible contaminations of x - ray emission from the central radio sources as reported by _",

    "we did not use # 43 a1758 and # 79 ms1054.5 - 0321 because their @xmath1-model parameters were not well constrained .",
    "the data analyses consisted of two major steps : 1 ) the spatial analysis with the _ rosat _ hri and 2 ) the spectral analysis with the _ asca _ gis and sis .    for 1 )",
    ", the radially - averaged x - ray surface brightness distribution was fitted with the isothermal @xmath1-model to determine the slope parameter @xmath1 , the core radius @xmath33 and the central surface brightness .",
    "the model gave an reasonably good fit to the observed surface brightness of many clusters : it resulted in a statistically acceptable fit for about 2/3 of the sample .",
    "for some clusters , however , it has left residual emission in the central region and a significant improvement was found when including an additional @xmath1-model component particularly for 9 clusters ( termed as `` double-@xmath1 '' clusters ) .",
    "we have further found that adoption of the single @xmath1-model for such double-@xmath1 clusters will return parameters consistent with one of the two @xmath1-model components , as shown in fig .",
    "9 of @xcite , which means the single @xmath1-model tends to pick up a component that dominates the emission .",
    "thus the present work basically stands on the single @xmath1-model for the reason that we are mainly interested in a systematic study on the global structure in a large number of distant clusters .",
    "note that possible systematic errors of physical parameters estimated under the @xmath1-model will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray morphology was measured with using ` centroid variations ' of the cluster image and the sample was classified into `` regular '' and `` irregular '' clusters ( see  3.2 of @xcite for details ) .    for 2 ) , the emission - weighted temperature and bolometric luminosity were measured from the _ asca _ spectroscopic data under the raymond - smith model @xcite , utilizing the xspec software version 9.0 .",
    "@xmath34 is the emission - weighted temperature determined from the simultaneous fitting to the _ asca _ gis and sis spectra extracted from @xmath35 and @xmath36 circular regions , respectively , and the bolometric luminosity , @xmath37 is calculated within a virial radius @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath38 is defined as the radius within which the average matter density is equal to @xmath39 times the critical density of the universe at the cluster redshift .    in",
    "what follows , we use the x - ray parameters derived under the single @xmath1-model ; the slope parameter @xmath1 , the core radius @xmath33 , the central electron density @xmath40 , and the radiative cooling time @xmath5 as well as spectroscopically measured @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "all quantities are listed in tables 2 , 4 , and 5 of @xcite .      to perform a reliable estimation of the @xmath1-model parameters",
    ", we have carefully checked the effect of the _ rosat_/hri psf on the spatial analysis . as detailed in   3.4 of @xcite , we confirmed that the effect is negligibly small and the parameters are well reproduced as long as @xmath33 is larger than @xmath43 .",
    "we have also checked the consistency with the previously published values from the _ chandra _ observations in regard to the @xmath1-model parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath33 ) and the temperature , and found a good agreement ( see   3.4 and   4.2 of @xcite ) . due to the large _ asca _ psf , it is not easy to measure the temperature profile accurately for the distant clusters .",
    "we then use the spectroscopically determined mean temperature in the parameter estimation .",
    "we will further evaluate possible systematic errors in estimating physical parameters under the @xmath1-model , @xmath37 and @xmath5 , which are important quantities in the present study .",
    "* @xmath37 + to estimate a systematic error of @xmath37 , we first calculate the bolometric luminosity within @xmath44 in two different ways : 1 ) convert the 210 kev luminosity measured with the gis spectrum into the bolometric luminosity using the emissivity of the raymond - smith plasma model and the _ asca _ temperature , and 2 ) integrate the @xmath1-model surface brightness distribution determined with the _ rosat _ hri within the same integration area and multiply it by the band correction factor .",
    "we found that two estimations are consistent within about 1020% in all three different temperature ranges of 25 , 57 , @xmath45  kev or four different redshift ranges , 0.10.2 , 0.20.3 , 0.30.4 , @xmath46 .",
    "this also assures that the current assumption of the isothermal @xmath1-model gives reasonably a good approximation to the real clusters in estimating @xmath37 .",
    "then we finally determine the bolometric luminosity within @xmath38 , @xmath37 from 1 ) the bolometric luminosity that was spectroscopically measured within @xmath47 under the raymond - smith model and corrected for the emission from outside @xmath47 by assuming the @xmath1-model surface brightness distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show a comparison of the bolometric luminosities measured with gis and hri .",
    "* @xmath5 + in the temperature range concerned , the cooling rate of the gas is dominated by free - free emission and then approximately proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , with the cooling rate in the form @xmath49 , we define the cooling time for a cluster as @xmath50 , where @xmath40 is the gas density at the cluster center .",
    "on the other hand , recent higher - resolution observations of clusters with a cooling core pointed that the conventional @xmath1-model does not sufficiently fit overall profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , if the central temperature drop by a factor of @xmath21 exists like what observed in many cooling - flow clusters , it might cause an overestimation of @xmath5 .",
    "we then make a comparison with recent results from @xcite as they analyzed _ chandra _ data of x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath51 and derived the cooling time profiles using spatially resolved spectral information . from fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , we find that there is an agreement between the two analyses : for 11 out of 21 distant clusters @xmath52 is consistent with the _ chandra _ results within the measurement errors . for the rest of them , it is systematically larger ( smaller ) for @xmath53  gyr ( @xmath54  gyr ) .",
    "as the clusters with @xmath54  gyr are mostly irregular ones , the underestimation might be due to their complex internal structure and different definitions of the centroid position . from temperature maps derived by @xcite",
    ", we found that clusters with systematically smaller @xmath5 tend to have hot spots at the centroids or gas hotter than the surrounding regions .",
    "this would then bias the temperature toward lower value ( as we use the emission - weighted temperature instead of the spatially - resolved central temperature ) and then higher central density ( to account for the observed emission measure ) , resulting in shorter @xmath5 . for clusters with @xmath53  gyr , the overestimation may be attributed to possible temperature decrease at the center : assuming that the central temperature is 1/2  1/3 of ambient temperature , @xmath55 , and the emission - weighted temperature is related through @xmath56 ( eq .  [ eq : temp_correction ] in   [ subsec : lx - t - tcool ] ) , @xmath52 is possibly overestimated by a factor of @xmath57 .",
    "thus this may reconcile the factor of @xmath21 difference seen in fig .",
    "however , because the above estimation depends on the assumed temperature profile , we use @xmath5 obtained from the @xmath1-model analysis of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data .",
    "note that the two analyses compared in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b are consistent within at most a factor of 2 and our discussion is not so much affected by the absolute value of @xmath5 as this paper aims at a study of a global trend of the icm evolution , which is suggested to proceed along the `` principal axis '' (   [ subsec : funda_plane ] ) over two orders of magnitudes of cooling time .",
    "since the @xmath0 relation is sensitive to the structure of the cluster core region , we first examine the core radius . as noted in @xcite , together with 45 nearby clusters analyzed in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath33 distribution of 121 clusters exhibits high concentrations around @xmath59kpc and @xmath60kpc .",
    "we show the core radius distribution of the present sample in fig .",
    "though the @xmath33 has a large cluster - to - cluster dispersion , we find that about 60% of clusters are included in narrow ranges corresponding to the two peaks .",
    "thus the large dispersion is partly due to the double peak structure of the @xmath33 distribution .    under the self - similar model , the internal structure of the gas",
    "should be scaled by the virial radius , and then @xmath61 should be constant for all clusters .",
    "however , as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , @xmath33 does not simply scaled by @xmath38 . as mentioned in @xcite",
    ", we should be careful about the results of the @xmath58 relation because it depends on the choice of the @xmath33 range .",
    "when we fit all the sample at the same time , we obtain a weak correlation , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) . since @xmath64 in general , @xmath38 is mostly determined by the temperature .",
    "actually @xmath33 and @xmath41 do not show a strong correlation . if we divide the sample into two @xmath33 groups relative to @xmath65  kpc , @xmath66 for 34 clusters with @xmath67  kpc ( @xmath68 ) while no meaningful correlation was found for 35 clusters with @xmath69  kpc ( the correlation coefficient is 0.21 ) .",
    "we further restrict the large core group to a narrow range , for example @xmath70  kpc , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus we consider that the large core clusters may marginally satisfy the self - similar condition ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the small core group clearly shows a deviation from the @xmath58 relation , the formation of the small cores is suggested to be determined from some physical process other than the self - similar collapse .",
    "furthermore , for 6 clusters with a very large core radius of @xmath73  kpc , which forms the third peak around 500  kpc in the @xmath33 histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , there is no meaningful @xmath58 correlation ( the correlation coefficient is 0.21 ) .",
    "thus they do not satisfy the self - similarity .",
    "this deviation may be attributed to the past or on - going merging events , which we will discuss in more detail in   [ subsec : lx - tbeta ] .      to investigate the global gas density structure",
    ", we plot the best - fit @xmath1-model profiles for 69 clusters in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the radius was normalized by @xmath38 .",
    "a significant scatter of the density exists within @xmath74 region ( typically @xmath75  kpc ) and the smaller core clusters show a systematically higher density in comparison to the large core clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the profiles are fairly universal outside that radius .",
    "we consider that this is consistent with the similarity found in outer regions of scaled profiles for nearby clusters @xcite .    in the next two subsections",
    "we will treat the core region and the envelope separately in order to directly show how the density profile is related to the scatter around the @xmath0 relation .",
    "we found that the @xmath58 relation and the density profile do not show a clear evolution against the observed redshift .",
    "however it is important to test whether the @xmath0 relation would evolve with redshift or it is more closely related with other physical parameters .",
    "then in   [ subsec : lx - t_redshift ] we will investigate the redshift dependence of the @xmath0 relation since the present sample covers the redshift range of @xmath76 .",
    "we calculate the luminosities outside a radius of @xmath2 and plot them against the temperature in fig .",
    "the radius was chosen so as to be a typical @xmath33 of the large core clusters , @xmath77  kpc and thus the emission from the core region can be removed from the overall emission . as a result , we obtained @xmath78 we found that there is no significant difference in the relation between the two @xmath33 groups ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) and the data scatter around the mean relation is surprisingly small .",
    "despite the similarity of the outer profiles shown in  [ subsec : gas_profile ] , however , the measured power - law index is yet close to 3 rather than the self - similar expectation of 2 .",
    "this is also true for 20 clusters with @xmath70  kpc , which marginally satisfy the self - similar relation as noted in ",
    "[ subsec : r500-rc ] ; the power - law index is @xmath79 .",
    "note that the @xmath0 relation is highly sensitive to the way the central emission is treated .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the slope of the @xmath0 relation would be flattened from @xmath80 to @xmath4 once corrected the central emission based on the standard cooling flow model .",
    "we find that the slope is still steeper than the prediction of the self - similar model by simply excluding the central component in a model - independent manner .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , we show the @xmath0 relation calculated for @xmath81 .",
    "the power - law fitting resulted in @xmath82 there is a significant data scatter in the plot and the luminosity is systematically higher for the small core group for a fixed temperature . if assuming the best - fit slope of 4.37 , the relations for the small and large core groups are obtained as : @xmath83 ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this significant difference in the normalization factor can be attributed to a negative correlation between the central density and the core radius as mentioned in  [ subsec : gas_profile ] .",
    "we then see from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] that the density scatter inside @xmath2 is indeed a source of scatter seen in the @xmath0 relation . in comparison to the result for @xmath84 , the large variety of the luminosity for @xmath81 and the significant deviation from the self - similarity for the small core clusters may imply that the dispersion around the @xmath0 is closely related to the evolution of the icm in the central region after the collapse .",
    "we investigate the redshift dependence of the @xmath0 relation by evaluating the relations for the following three subsets of data : 18 clusters in @xmath85 , 27 clusters in @xmath86 , and 24 clusters in @xmath87 ( only 7 out of 24 have @xmath88 ) and compare with the previous results on high - redshift ( @xmath88 ) and low - redshift ( @xmath89 ) clusters . to constrain the redshift dependence in the core and outer region separately",
    ", we also derive the @xmath26 relation for @xmath81 and @xmath84 .",
    "we did not apply the evolution correction to @xmath37 ( i.e. multiplying @xmath37 by @xmath90 since it does not significantly change the relation for @xmath39 as shown in table  9 of @xcite . )    * @xmath0 relation + the power - law fitting of the @xmath91 relations for three redshift subgroups resulted in @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "there is a marginal trend to obtain a steeper slope and a smaller normalization factor for the higher redshfit clusters .",

    "although the marginal , negative evolution of the normalization factor seen in the @xmath104 relation might imply a progress of gas concentration as redshift , the study of redshift evolution requires higher - accuracy determination of parameters and thus is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "the scatter seems to link more strongly to the other parameters describing the core structure , which we will try to show more directly in   [ sec : lx - t - rc ] and   [ sec : lx - t - tcool ] .",
    "besides , @xcite showed that there is not strong redshift evolution in the observed x - ray properties particularly at @xmath105 , including the central gas density , the core radius , and temperature . as we will show in   [ subsec : funda_plane ] , the current sample is also found to have an x - ray fundamental plane similar to that found in nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "we will then carry out statistical studies regardless of their redshifts in the paper .",

[ fig6]a , we show the @xmath0 relation of 69 clusters where we again divide the sample into two subgroups according to two different @xmath33 ranges . as pointed out in @xcite , the distributions of the two subgroups are systematically shifted in the figure ; the luminosity of a small core cluster is on average higher than that of a large core cluster for a fixed temperature .",
    "if we fit all the 69 clusters at the same time , we obtain a power - law index of @xmath8 ( 90% error ) . since we found that there is not significant difference in the power - law indices between the two subgroups ( table  [ tab1 ] ) , we obtain the best - fit normalization factors of the relation to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 by fitting them separately but fixing the indices at the mean value of 3.01 .",

    "we found that the result depends little on the redshift , as shown in fig .",

    "we indicated the possible three phases of the gas property along the @xmath212 axis in fig .",
    "[ fig14]d , according to the different level of cooling and icm density structure .      in the context of isobaric cooling flow model , the local density of the gas increases against decreasing the temperature so that the thermal pressure @xmath216 at given @xmath217 is kept constant within the cooling radius , i.e. @xmath218 , and then @xmath219 would follow . if this is the case , since @xmath220 for the gas hotter than @xmath221  kev , the @xmath222 relation would exhibit @xmath223 .",
    "for a typical cooling radius of @xmath224 ( @xmath225  kpc ) , @xmath226 contributes about 50% of the total luminosity .",
    "when we derived the @xmath227 relation , however , we did not find any tendency for such an inverse correlation ( see also the @xmath96 relation in fig .  [",
    "fig4]a ) .",
    "the observational results indicate that the gas in the core region of small core clusters is undergoing radiative cooling but the temperature decline towards the center seems mild .",
    "the gas may be considered close to a steady state .",
    "we will discuss such a possible state of the gas , quasi - hydrostatic cooling , proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model predicts a moderate and smooth gas inflow with hydrostatic balancing . in the context , unlike isobaric cooling flows that increase the local density so @xmath216 is kept against local cooling , quasi - hydrostatic cooling allows the gas to modify its profile or core size so @xmath228 matches with the force by gravitational potential .",
    "in   [ subsec : lx - t - tcool ] we derived the @xmath6 relation by correcting the emission - weighted temperature for small - core clusters with short @xmath5 based on the idea of the universal temperature profile , and showed that the bolometric luminosity normalized by the temperature dependence of @xmath229 , @xmath10 is constant within the data scatter over a wide range of @xmath230 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the rate of thermal energy loss is kept nearly constant after the onset of cooling in the cluster core .",
    "according to the quasi - hydrostatic model , the temperature starts to decrease at the cooling radius and approaches a constant of @xmath231 the ambient temperature towards the center .",
    "the temperature profile does not depend on its absolute value .",
    "this picture may explain the observations of nearby cooling - flow clusters .",
    "the mass inflow rate from the outer region is controlled by cooling so as to maintain the quasi - hydrostatic balance and is expected to vary little through the flow .",
    "the condition is well satisfied in the case that the temperature is @xmath232  kev where bremsstrahlung dominates cooling more than line emission .",
    "the present sample meets this condition since it has a temperature range of @xmath233}<12 $ ] .",
    "therefore our results can be consistently understood within a framework of the quasi - hydrostatic cooling model .    at the same time",
    ", we have found that the gas density profile for the outer part of the cluster does not vary very much from cluster to cluster , and is almost independent of the gas cooling at the center .",
    "this would also imply that the energy loss due to radiative cooling at the center is only a portion of the total energy of the thermal gas , and the outer region is likely to offer a great _ reservoir _ of the heat , which is carried a fraction into the inner cooling region advectively by the gas inflow under quasi - hydrostatic balance .",
    "as described above , cooling with quasi - hydrostatic balancing modifies the core structure of the gas .",
    "this may give a clue to the origin of the small core of @xmath23  kpc or the inner core component of the double-@xmath1 cluster .",
    "in addition the study would also have an impact on the present understanding of the origin of the dispersions around the @xmath0 relation because it provided the observational evidence that they are directly linked to the thermal evolution of the icm and showed how the relation would be modified when the effect of the cooling is considered .      in this subsection",
    "we attempt to present an overall picture of the icm evolution on the basis of the observational results .",
    "first we consider about the @xmath33 distribution and the origin of the double-@xmath1 nature of the clusters from the phenomenological point of views .",
    "we have reported that the cluster core radius has a large cluster - to - cluster dispersion of more than an order of magnitude , even if restricted the sample to the regular clusters @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the presence of two peaks separated by a factor of @xmath234 . for 9 ( 7 ) out of the 35 regular clusters ,",
    "the surface brightness is significantly ( marginally ) better fitted with the double-@xmath1 model , and the average values of two core radii for the double-@xmath1 clusters coincide well with the two @xmath33 peaks of the single-@xmath1 clusters",
    ". then a question may arise : are there three subclasses of clusters , small - core single-@xmath1 , large core single-@xmath1 , and double-@xmath1 clusters , or are we looking at some different aspects of a single evolutionary process ? from the imaging analysis , we noticed that the double-@xmath1 clusters are further subdivided into inner - core dominant and outer - core dominant ones ; if we are to perform a single @xmath1 model fitting for these clusters , we would pick up either of the core radii as the best - fit result .",
    "thus the similarity in the @xmath33 distributions for the single-@xmath1 and double-@xmath1 clusters can be interpreted in the following way : the ( regular ) clusters have more or less double-@xmath1 nature in their structure , and when x - ray emission from one of the two cores dominates the whole cluster emission , we recognize it as the single-@xmath1 case and pick up either the inner or outer core as the core radius .",
    "this will account for an apparent large dispersion of core radius .",
    "accordingly the single-@xmath1 clusters with a small / large core radius may respectively correspond to extreme cases of inner / outer core dominant double-@xmath1 clusters .",
    "then why are there inner - core dominant and outer - core dominant clusters ?",
    "such double structures have often been attributed to the cooling - flow phenomenon at the cluster center .",
    "however , the present analysis showed that the standard cooling - flow model with dynamic inflow is not preferable to account for the results , in particular the @xmath235 and @xmath236 relations . on the other hand , in ",
    "[ sec : lx - tbeta ] we suggested the possible three phases of the icm property on the @xmath237 plane in the light of the radiative cooling and the relevance to a variety of density structure .",
    "it is likely that the double-@xmath1 clusters are those in the transient phase of their cooling cores , i.e. , core size transition from outer - core dominated to inner - core dominated , mentioned in the quasi - hydrostatic cooling model . as the interpretation of the double core nature",
    ", we consider in the following way : when some time passed after the collapse and the cooling becomes important , the core is radiatively cooled and the central density gradually becomes higher to evolve from an outer - core - dominant cluster toward an inner - core - dominant cluster .",
    "the above discussion on the evolution of gas structure focused on the effect of radiative cooling and the possibility of quasi - hydrostatic state since the x - ray analysis showed that a majority of small core clusters are distributed in a narrow range of @xmath10 once the temperature bias is corrected ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) and thus supports the existence of a typical value .",
    "moreover , a long tail at the smaller @xmath10 is seen in the histogram for @xmath238  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig12]c ) .",
    "this indicates existence of some peculiar clusters or extra physical mechanism that produces such a variation .",
    "recently , @xcite examined a relation between substructure and cool cores and the scatter about cluster scaling relations using 45 nearby clusters .",
    "they found that cool core clusters , which usually have less morphological substructure , exhibit higher intrinsic scatter about scaling relations even after correcting for cooling core effect , suggesting a possibility that a more global process is at work .",
    "then the variation in the @xmath10 histogram for the small @xmath33 clusters may be related with the scatter found by @xcite .",
    "to further clarify both the structural evolution and the scatter of scaling relations , a systematic study with higher sensitivities will be important .      we will remark on the effect of the cold front detected in nearby clusters with the _ chandra _ observations in regard to the present interpretation , and the assumption of the universal temperature profile with consideration on the recent progress of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the cold front structure is characterized by a compact core with the density and temperature jumps in contrast to the surroundings , and interpreted as a remnant of subcluster merger @xcite . for higher redshifts , it is more difficult to directly identify such small structures due to the limitation of the sensitivity to measure the temperature maps , and some of them might possibly be fitted with the double-@xmath1 model . however , as the cold front is a signature of recent merger , it is expected to be accompanied with the irregular x - ray morphology .",
    "thus for relatively bright clusters , a small core of the cold front in an irregular cluster may be distinguishable from that of a regular cluster by referring to the morphological information .",
    "for example , and , for which a possible remnant of cooling core of a merging subcluster was pointed out @xcite , were classified into irregular clusters from our image analysis , though they have different @xmath33 and are located in the different phases in fig .",
    "[ fig14]d ( i ) and iii ) , respectively ) . for more accurate identification of the cold front in distant clusters ,",
    "it is necessary to measure the 2 dimensional density and temperature maps with higher sensitivity observations .",
    "we have utilized the universal temperature profile to estimate the effect of temperature decrease and relate the emission - weighted temperature to the ambient temperature for clusters with short cooling time and apparent luminosity enhancement in fig .",
    "[ fig10]b . due to the limited spatial resolution of _ asca",
    "_ , the temperature profiles were not directly constrained for the distant sample .",
    "however for some of them , the results have been already published with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data . as for the double-@xmath1 clusters or the small core cluster with very short cooling time of @xmath239 , , , , , the gradual temperature decline within the central region of roughly @xmath240  kpc",
