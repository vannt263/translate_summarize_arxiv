    "more recent observations of  and  at the same location as the  peak were carried out by tin et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who obtained fractionation ratios of 0.35 and 0.18 respectively for these ions .",
    "in addition to the deuterium fractionation , it is known that the absolute abundances relative to h@xmath11 of  and n@xmath11h@xmath12 peak at the same position ( ungerechts , walmsley , & winnewisser 1980 ; swade 1989 ; dickens et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the only other doubly deuterated molecule observed in the interstellar medium is d@xmath11co , which has been detected in two regions : the well - known orion compact ridge source ( turner 1990 ) and the low - mass protostar iras 16293 - 2422 ( ceccarelli et  al .",
    "1998 ; loinard et  al .",
    "2000 ) . in both cases , the large d@xmath11co fractionation  @xmath2(d@xmath11co@xmath13 and 0.35 respectively  is thought to result from grain surface chemistry , since the molecular abundances in these warm regions reflect the evaporation of ice mantles from interstellar dust grains ( e.g.  brown , charnley , & millar 1988 ) , and the post - evaporation molecular d / h ratios remain equal to the ratios in the precursor ices for over @xmath14 years ( rodgers & millar 1996 ) .",
    "deuterated formaldehyde forms on grains via addition of h and d atoms to co ( tielens 1983 ; charnley , tielens , & rodgers 1997 ) , and so large amounts of hdco and d@xmath11co can be expected if the gas - phase atomic d / h ratio is large .    and",
    "can also form on grains through d and h atom additions to atomic n ( brown & millar 1989 ) . however , as noted by roueff et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the lack of ongoing star formation , together with the low temperature in l134n ( @xmath1512k ; swade 1989 ; dickens et  al .",
    "2000 ) , suggests that mantle removal has not occurred .",
    "markwick , millar , & charnley ( 2000 ) have proposed a nonthermal mechanism for removing grain mantles in dark clouds involving ion - neutral streaming produced in mhd motions .",
    "however , this process also acts to remove @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the gas ( charnley 1998 ) and so this mechanism is unlikely to have occurred at the deuterium emission peak in l134n .",
    "it therefore appears that the  and  observed in l134n must be created in the gas phase .    in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of gas phase ammonia deuteration .",
    "we first discuss the underlying chemistry which controls the deuterium fractionation and ammonia abundances in dark clouds .",
    "we then show how successive deuteron transfer reactions can lead to large abundances of multiply - deuterated ammonia .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the steady - state d / h ratios in isotopomers of ammonia , and compare these theoretical ratios with those observed in l134n and with those expected from grain surface chemistry .",
    "a number of singly - deuterated molecules have been detected in dark interstellar clouds with large fractionations ( @xmath180.1 ) , and the theory behind the observed d enhancement is well understood ( e.g.watson 1974 ; gulin et  al .",
    "1982 ; millar , bennett , & herbst 1989 ; roberts & millar 2000 ) . essentially , small zero - point energy differences ensure that molecular ions become preferentially deuterated via d / h exchange reactions with hd , and subsequent ion - molecule reactions spread this d - enrichment to neutral species . at 10k , the most important fractionation process is that of h@xmath11d@xmath12 : @xmath19 we can quantify the degree of fractionation attainable by reaction  ( [ rfrac1 ] ) by writing @xmath20 where @xmath2(hd ) will be twice the cosmic d / h ratio of @xmath21 ( linsky et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and @xmath22 is the so - called enhancement factor , given by : @xmath23 ( stark , van der tak , & van dishoeck 1999 ; millar et  al .",
    "2000 ) . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the forward and reverse rate coefficients for reaction ( [ rfrac1 ] ) ; at 10k the respective values are @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28s@xmath29 ( millar et  al .  1989 ; sidhu , miller , & tennyson 1992 ) , @xmath30 is the electron fraction , @xmath31 is the rate coefficient for proton or deuteron transfer to species @xmath32 ( principally co , n@xmath11 and o ) whose abundance is @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the electron dissociative recombination coefficient of @xmath16 ( equal to @xmath35 ( @xmath36/300k)@xmath37 @xmath38s@xmath29 ; larsson et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "proton transfer from h@xmath39 to co and n@xmath11 is the primary source of the hco@xmath12 and n@xmath11h@xmath12 ions , so the h@xmath11d@xmath12 enhancement also determines the fractionation of dco@xmath12 and n@xmath11d@xmath12 .",
    "if we assume that one third of such reactions result in deuteron transfer , it follows that @xmath40 this simple theory predicts that the fractionation of n@xmath11d@xmath12 and dco@xmath12 should be equal .",
    "however , as discussed in @xmath411 , the values measured in l134n by tin et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) are 0.35 and 0.18 respectively .",
    "this discrepancy is puzzling , since if anything , the value of @xmath2(dco@xmath12 ) should be larger than @xmath2(n@xmath11d@xmath12 ) as dco@xmath12 is also fractionated via the reaction of hco@xmath12 with atomic d ( adams & smith 1985 ; cf .",
    "dalgarno & lepp 1984 ; opendak 1993 ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that deuteron transfer from h@xmath11d@xmath12 to n@xmath11 occurs preferentially to proton transfer , but that the branching ratios for are statistical . nevertheless , the n@xmath11d@xmath12 fractionation is comparable to that determined by snyder et  al .",
    "( 1977 ) and , to order of magnitude , the observed fractionation is compatible with the above theory if @xmath42 .",
    "the observed ammonia abundance in l134n is @xmath43 ( swade 1989 ; dickens et  al .",
    "2000 ) , in agreement with the steady - state value in chemical models where most of the nitrogen is in molecular form ( e.g.millar , farquhar , & willacy 1997 ) . in this case ,",
    "ammonia formation is initiated by he@xmath12 attack on n@xmath11 to form n@xmath12 .",
    "this ion then undergoes successive reactions with h@xmath11 until nh@xmath44 is formed , which then recombines to give : @xmath45 this formation mechanism remains somewhat controversial , because the first hydrogenation step @xmath46 is endothermic by @xmath47k ( marquette , rebrion , & rowe 1988 ) .",
    "however , this is slightly less than the ground state rotational energy of ortho - h@xmath11 , and le bourlot ( 1991 ) showed that as long as the ortho - to - para ratio is greater than @xmath48 then reaction ( [ nplush2 ] ) is the dominant loss route for n@xmath12 , so reaction sequence ( [ seq ] ) proceeds efficiently . even at 10k ,",
    "chemical cycling between ortho and para - h@xmath11 via proton transfer reactions is able to provide sufficient ortho - h@xmath11 ( le bourlot 1991 , 2000 ) .",
    "we have extended our steady - state analysis to include multiply deuterated ammonia .",
    "figure  1 shows the primary chemical reactions creating and destroying  and its associated isotopomers through ion - molecule reactions involving generic protonated and deuterated ions , xh@xmath12 and xd@xmath12 .",
    "after  is formed by the reaction sequence ( [ seq ] ) , deuteron transfer reactions form  which can then recombine to give .",
    "successive deuteron transfer reactions can lead eventually to  and .",
    "the relative steady - state abundances therefore depend on the xd@xmath12/xh@xmath12 ratio and the branching ratios for dissociative recombination of the deuterated ions .",
    "we assume that the /nh@xmath11 branching ratio , @xmath51 , is the same for deuterated ammonium ions as for , and we assume statistical branching ratios regarding the position of the d in the products ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "gellene & porter ( 1984 ) measured the branching ratios for electron dissociative recombination of nhd@xmath39 and found h atom ejection occurred 2.7 times more frequently than d ejection , implying that the n ",
    "h bonds are eight times more likely to break than the n ",
    "a similar effect has been observed in the recombination of hdo@xmath12 and hd@xmath11o@xmath12 ( jensen et  al .  1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , our results represent a lower limit to the amount of deuteration that can occur via ion - molecule chemistry , since preferential retention of the d in the molecule is more likely to occur .    for each of the species in fig .  1",
    ", one can write an expression equating the formation and destruction rates . these expressions can then be solved to give the number density ratios at steady state .",
    "after some algebra one obtains : @xmath64 note that , although the _ absolute _ abundances will depend on the formation rate of , the _ relative _ abundances of the deuterated forms depend only on @xmath60 and @xmath51 , and so are not affected by any uncertainty regarding the kinetics of ammonia synthesis .",
    "solutions of equations ( [ r3])([r1 ] ) are plotted in figure  2 . for @xmath65",
    "the predicted values are proportional to @xmath60 . at larger values of @xmath60",
    "the curves asymptotically approach the value determined by the branching ratios of the deuterated ammonium ions .",
    "the shaded region in fig .  2 covers the observed range in @xmath60 ; from a lower bound of 0.05 inferred from dco@xmath12 observations ( see @xmath66 ) , up to a maximum of 0.35 implied by the n@xmath11d@xmath12 observations of tin et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) . the filled circles in fig .",
    "2 show the observed  and  ratios ; the fact that both the observed values imply the _ same _ underlying value of @xmath60 is convincing evidence that gas - phase chemistry is the source of the  and  in l134n .",
    "note that there also exists another gas phase route to singly - deuterated ammonia : the reaction of n@xmath12 with hd , analogous to reaction  ( [ nplush2 ] ) . in this case , the channel leading to @xmath67 is favored over @xmath68 , since the endothermicity of the former channel is only 16k ( marquette et  al .",
    "1988 ) . hence ,",
    "if the h@xmath11 ortho - to - para ratio is low so that reaction  ( [ nplush2 ] ) occurs slowly , this can lead to large enhancements of  via the deuterated version of reaction sequence  ( [ seq ] ) ( tin et  al .",
    "however , this mechanism can not explain the presence of doubly - deuterated ammonia .",
    "as we have shown that deuteron transfer reactions are more than capable of producing the observed  and  abundances , we believe that the scheme illustrated in fig .  1 is sufficient to explain the ammonia deuteration in l134n .",
    "we have shown that the observed abundances of ammonia isotopomers in l134n are consistent with the steady - state solutions of a relatively simple ion - molecule reaction scheme ( see fig .  1 ) , if the value of @xmath69 .",
    "in order to assess the validity of our analysis , we would like to be able to reconcile our scheme with the observed abundances of simple molecular ions and their deuterated counterparts .",
    "the observed range of values for @xmath60 implies a value of @xmath70 of 500035000 ( eqn .",
    "[ [ dcop ] ] ) . in order to calculate the expected value of @xmath70 in l134n from equation  ( [ cals ] ) , we need to know the electron fraction , @xmath30 , and @xmath71 , the total removal rate of h@xmath11d@xmath12 through reactions with heavy species",
    ". we can calculate these values approximately from the the steady - state h@xmath39 concentration , which is given by @xmath72 and the charge conservation equation : @xmath73 note that the rate coefficients in equation  ( [ h3plus ] ) are the same as in equation  ( [ cals ] ) , since we assume that h@xmath11d@xmath12 reacts at the same rate as h@xmath39 , except for electron recombination , where we use the value for @xmath74 of @xmath75 measured by sundstrm et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "hco@xmath12 and n@xmath11h@xmath12 have been observed in l134n , and their respective abundances are @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( swade 1989 ; womack et  al .  1992a ; dickens et  al .",
    "2000 ) . adopting physical parameters of @xmath78k and @xmath79  @xmath80 ( dickens et  al .",
    "2000 ) , we thus have three equations ( [ [ cals ] ] , [ [ h3plus ] ] , and [ [ econs ] ] ) in three unknowns ( @xmath30 , @xmath81 , and @xmath71 ) .",
    "solving these equations for different values of @xmath70 allows us to constrain the chemical state of l134n . also ,",
    "because the rate coefficients for reactions of h@xmath39 and h@xmath11d@xmath12 with heavy molecules are @xmath82  @xmath28  s@xmath29 , we can calculate the total abundance of heavy molecules from our derived value of @xmath71 .    for @xmath83 ,",
    "we calculate @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , consistent with little depletion of co , n@xmath11 , and o from the gas phase . on the other hand , for @xmath87 , we derive @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , implying significant depletion . for the intermediate value of @xmath91 inferred from the deuterated ammonia fractionation",
    ", we find that partial depletion ( @xmath92% ) of heavy molecules is required to account for the observed deuterium enhancements .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by roberts & millar ( 2000 ) . finally , as our calculated ionization levels lead to good agreement with the observed  abundance ( @xmath93 )",
    ", we conclude that the observed abundances and fractionations in l134n are well - matched by steady - state ion - molecule chemistry .",
    "despite reservations concerning the physical conditions in l134n , some as yet unidentified mechanism may be returning mantle - formed molecules to the gas there .",
    "the mantle abundances of ammonia isotopomers computed numerically by brown & millar ( 1989 ) ( see their table 2 ) effectively rule out a grain surface origin when scaled to the ammonia abundance in l134n . however , their surface reaction scheme permits larger d / h ratios than those presented , since the fractionation is proportional to the gas phase atomic d / h ratio , @xmath2(d ) , which may be higher than the value assumed in their calculations . following the scheme of brown & millar",
    ", we can derive values for the surface fractionation ratios : @xmath94 thus , if @xmath95 , then it is also possible to explain the observed abundances by surface formation of ammonia .",
    "it may be possible , however , to discriminate between alternative formation mechanisms by examining the relative scaling of the fractionation ratios .",
    "for example , grain surface formation implies that @xmath96 whereas , to first order , gas phase chemistry implies ( using equations [ [ r3]][[r1 ] ] ) @xmath97 the fact that the calculated values of @xmath2 for the three isotopomers always have the same ratio irrespective of their absolute values is apparent from fig .  2 , where the vertical separation of the curves for the three isotopomers is constant .    for doubly - deuterated ammonia ,",
    "the predicted ratios are similar , with the observed value of @xmath98 implying respective values of @xmath99 and 0.03 for gas phase and surface chemistry .",
    "although the observed value of 0.05 agrees with our gas phase scheme , the observational uncertainties are too large to rule out surface formation . however , for triply - deuterated ammonia , the gas phase scheme predicts a fractionation almost twice as large ; when scaled to the  abundance this implies a /  ratio 2.5 times greater than the value predicted by surface chemistry ( where we have used the relation @xmath100 ; cf .  our definition of @xmath2 in @xmath101 ) .",
    "with the observed values @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we predict @xmath104 . hence ,",
    "if  can be detected ( or an upper limit determined ) in l134n , it may be possible to determine whether the ammonia is formed in the gas or on the grains .",
    "it is worth stressing that the kind of scaling relations for multiply - deuterated fractionation ratios expressed by equations  ( [ surfscale ] ) and ( [ gasscale ] ) are applicable in general to all molecules .",
    "thus , whereas the fractionation of singly - deuterated molecules reflects both the formation mechanism of the molecule and the underlying d / h ratio in the precursors , the relative fractionation ratios of multiply - deuterated molecules reflect only the formation mechanism .",
    "this fact was first appreciated by turner ( 1990 ) , who used the d@xmath11co : hdco : h@xmath11co ratios to show that formaldehyde in the orion compact ridge should have a grain surface origin .",
    "we have shown that large abundances of  and  can be produced by gas phase chemistry in the interiors of cold dense clouds .",
    "ammonia is deuterated via deuteron transfer from species such as h@xmath11d@xmath12 , dco@xmath12 , and n@xmath11d@xmath12 , followed by dissociative recombination .",
    "this mechanism is able to match the observed fractionation ratios of both species if the underlying xd@xmath12/xh@xmath12 ratio , @xmath60 , equals 0.1 .",
    "grain surface formation of ammonia produces distinct fractionation ratios , however the uncertainties in the observed abundances mean that we can not definitively conclude that deuterated  is being formed in the gas .",
    "because the scaling of the fractionation ratios expected from these two processes is not the same , this raises the possibility that the : :  ratios may ultimately be used to determine the origin of these molecules . in particular , this could be resolved with the detection of , which we predict to have an abundance of @xmath105 in l134n .",
    "gas phase formation appears more feasible than surface chemistry since it is able to account for the observed  abundance without recourse to uncertain surface processes and desorption mechanisms .",
    "a further problem for the grain surface hypothesis is the fact that the large value of @xmath2 ( ) in l134n requires a gas phase atomic d / h ratio of 0.05 , but theoretical models predict an equilibrium value of only a few times @xmath106 at 10k ( millar et  al .",
    "1989 ; roberts & millar 2000 ) .",
    "we also find that the large observed molecular d / h ratios can only be reproduced if heavy elements are partially depleted onto grain surfaces .",
    "therefore , it appears that the deuterium emission peak in l134n traces a small region where significant amounts of co , n@xmath11 and o are frozen onto grains .",
    "a similar region of enhanced d fractionation is known to exist in tmc-1 ( gulin et  al .",
    "1982 ) , a dark cloud that appears to be physically similar to l134n .",
    "the fact that there appear to be several infrared sources located behind l134n ( snell 1981 ) may allow the molecular depletion into ice mantles to be measured and crudely mapped . alternatively , these spatial gradients may be due to the energy available when ions and neutrals have slightly different velocities . in this case",
    ", @xmath25 becomes the dominant term in the denominator of the expression for @xmath22 ( eqn .",
    "[ [ cals ] ] ) , which is consequently reduced ( charnley 1998 ) .",
    "another explanation may be the existence of chemical bistability in interstellar clouds ; gerin et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that molecular d / h ratios are typically reduced by a factor of ten in the high ionization phase steady - state solution , as opposed to the low ionization phase .",
    "nevertheless , it seems more likely that depletion is the cause of the high deuteration in l134n , since the latter mechanisms act to reduce @xmath70 whereas depletion causes @xmath70 to increase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed range of @xmath60 in l134n is always @xmath107 ; this is what one would expect for a 10k cloud with no depletion , and is in fact the value derived from dco@xmath12 observations of a large number of cold clouds ( gulin et  al .",
    "1982 ; butner et  al .  1995 ) .",
    "the fact that the fractionation in l134n is determined to be above this canonical cold cloud value is evidence for selective deuterium enhancement in this particular region , as opposed to a reduction of the fractionation in the surrounding gas . on the other hand , gerin et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed a value of @xmath108 in the high latitude cloud mcld  123.5@xmath10924.9 , ten times lower than the ` normal ' value . in this instance , it would appear that some mechanism is indeed operating to suppress the d / h enhancement .",
    "if the depletion is particularly large , the value of @xmath60 can become as large as unity ( millar et  al .",
    "2000 ) . in this case ,",
    "chemical models predict large abundances of hdco and d@xmath11co ( roberts & millar 2000 ) , so it may be fruitful to search for d@xmath11co in dark clouds .",
    "note , however , that deuterated formaldehyde may not in fact be as abundant as predicted by these models where it is assumed that h@xmath11co is deuterated via the same mechanism as , namely deuteron transfer from h@xmath11d@xmath12 , dco@xmath12 etc .",
    "followed by dissociative recombination .",
    "in fact , the lowest energy isomer of protonated formaldehyde has the form h@xmath11coh@xmath12 , and this ion has been detected in the interstellar medium ( ohishi et  al .",
    "we may therefore expect that deuteron transfer to h@xmath11co will most likely result in h@xmath11cod@xmath12 and will not lead to hdco after dissociative recombination ( sen , anicich , & federman 1992 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the dco@xmath12 fractionation of 0.05 observed in a number of sources by butner et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) is only a factor of two less than the value of @xmath60 required to explain the ammonia deuteration in l134n .",
