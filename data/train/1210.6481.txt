    "in this paper , different classical results @xcite are recalled .",
    "they are obtained from a geometrical interpretation of different multi - agent systems evolving in phase space under the hypothesis of equiprobability @xcite .",
    "two nonlinear models that explain the decay of these statistical systems to their asymptotic equilibrium states are also collected @xcite .",
    "we sketch in section [ s2 ] the derivation of the boltzmann - gibbs ( exponential ) distribution @xcite by means of the geometrical properties of the volume of an @xmath0-dimensional pyramid .",
    "the same result is obtained when the calculation is performed over the surface of a such @xmath0-dimensional body . in both cases ,",
    "the motivation is a multi - agent economic system with an open or closed economy , respectively .",
    "also , a continuous version of an homogeneous economic gas - like model @xcite is given in the section [ s2 ] .",
    "this model explains the appearance , independently of the initial wealth distribution given to the system , of the exponential ( boltzmann - gibbs ) distribution as the asymptotic equilibrium in random markets , and in general in many other natural phenomena with the same type of interactions .",
    "the maxwellian ( gaussian ) distribution is derived in section [ s3 ] from geometrical arguments over the volume or the surface of an @xmath0-sphere @xcite . here",
    ", the motivation is a multi - particle gas system in contact with a heat reservoir ( non - isolated or open system ) or with a fixed energy ( isolated or closed system ) , respectively .",
    "the ubiquity of the maxwellian velocity distribution in ideal gases is also explained in the section [ s3 ] with a nonlinear mapping acting in the space of velocity distributions @xcite .",
    "this mapping is an operator that gives account of the decay of any initial velocity distribution toward the gaussian ( maxwellian ) distribution .",
    "last section contains the conclusions .",
    "here we assume @xmath0 agents , each one with coordinate @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 representing the wealth or money of the agent @xmath4 , and a total available amount of money @xmath5 : @xmath6 under random or deterministic evolution rules for the exchanging of money among agents , let us suppose that this system evolves in the interior of the @xmath0-dimensional pyramid given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - e ] ) .",
    "the role of a heat reservoir , that in this model supplies money instead of energy , could be played by the state or by the bank system in western societies .",
    "the formula for the volume @xmath7 of an equilateral @xmath0-dimensional pyramid formed by @xmath8 vertices linked by @xmath0 perpendicular sides of length @xmath5 is @xmath9 we suppose that each point on the @xmath0-dimensional pyramid is equiprobable , then the probability @xmath10 of finding the agent @xmath4 with money @xmath1 is proportional to the volume formed by all the points into the @xmath11-dimensional pyramid having the @xmath4th - coordinate equal to @xmath1 .",
    "then , it can be shown that the boltzmann factor ( or the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 that verifies the normalization condition @xmath14 the final form of @xmath15 , in the asymptotic regime @xmath16 ( which implies @xmath17 ) and taking the mean wealth @xmath18 , is : @xmath19 where the index @xmath4 has been removed because the distribution is the same for each agent , and thus the wealth distribution can be obtained by averaging over all the agents .",
    "this distribution has been found to fit the real distribution of incomes in western societies @xcite .",
    "we derive now the boltzmann - gibbs distribution by considering the system in isolation , that is , a closed economy . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume @xmath0 interacting economic agents , each one with coordinate @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , and where @xmath1 represents an amount of money .",
    "if we suppose that the total amount of money @xmath5 is conserved , @xmath20 then this isolated system evolves on the positive part of an equilateral @xmath0-hyperplane .",
    "the surface area @xmath21 of an equilateral @xmath0-hyperplane of side @xmath5 is given by @xmath22 if the ergodic hypothesis is assumed , each point on the @xmath0-hyperplane is equiprobable .",
    "then the probability @xmath10 of finding agent @xmath4 with money @xmath1 is proportional to the surface area formed by all the points on the @xmath0-hyperplane having the @xmath4th - coordinate equal to @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath12 is the boltzmann factor ( boltzmann - gibbs distribution ) , with the normalization condition ( [ eq - p_n1 ] ) .",
    "it takes the form , @xmath23 where the coordinate @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "after some calculation the boltzmann distribution is newly recovered : @xmath26 with @xmath27 , being @xmath28 the boltzmann constant and @xmath29 the temperature of the statistical system .",
    "we consider an ensemble of economic agents trading with money in a random manner @xcite .",
    "this is one of the simplest gas - like models , in which an initial amount of money is given to each agent , let us suppose the same to each one .",
    "then , pairs of agents are randomly chosen and they exchange their money also in a random way .",
    "when the gas evolves under these conditions , the exponential distribution appears as the asymptotic wealth distribution . in this model ,",
    "the microdynamics is conservative because the local interactions conserve the money .",
    "hence , the macrodynamics is also conservative and the total amount of money is constant in time .",
    "the discrete version of this model is as follows @xcite .",
    "the trading rules for each interacting pair @xmath30 of the ensemble of @xmath0 economic agents can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a random number in the interval @xmath33 .",
    "the agents @xmath34 are randomly chosen .",
    "their initial money @xmath35 , at time @xmath36 , is transformed after the interaction in @xmath37 at time @xmath38 .",
    "the asymptotic distribution @xmath39 , obtained by numerical simulations , is the exponential ( boltzmann - gibbs ) distribution , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the pdf ( _ probability density function _ ) , i.e. the probability of finding an agent with money ( or energy in a gas system ) between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "evidently , this pdf is normalized , @xmath44 .",
    "the mean value of the wealth , @xmath45 , can be easily calculated directly from the gas by @xmath46 .",
    "the continuous version of this model @xcite considers the evolution of an initial wealth distribution @xmath47 at each time step @xmath48 under the action of an operator @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the system evolves from time @xmath48 to time @xmath50 to asymptotically reach the equilibrium distribution @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath51 in this particular case , @xmath39 is the exponential distribution with the same average value @xmath52 than the initial one @xmath53 , due to the local and total richness conservation .",
    "the derivation of the operator @xmath49 is as follows @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath54 is the wealth distribution in the ensemble at time @xmath48 .",
    "the probability to have a quantity of money @xmath55 at time @xmath50 will be the sum of the probabilities of all those pairs of agents @xmath56 able to produce the quantity @xmath55 after their interaction , that is , all the pairs verifying @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the probability that two of these agents with money @xmath56 interact between them is @xmath58 .",
    "their exchange is totally random and then they can give rise with equal probability to any value @xmath55 comprised in the interval @xmath59 . therefore , the probability to obtain a particular @xmath55 ( with @xmath60 ) for the interacting pair @xmath56 will be @xmath61 .",
    "then , @xmath49 has the form of a nonlinear integral operator , @xmath62    if we suppose @xmath49 acting in the pdfs space , it has been proved @xcite that @xmath49 conserves the mean wealth of the system , @xmath63 .",
    "it also conserves the norm ( @xmath64 ) , i.e. @xmath49 maintains the total number of agents of the system , @xmath65 , that by extension implies the conservation of the total richness of the system .",
    "we have also shown that the exponential distribution @xmath66 with the right average value is the only steady state of @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath67 . computations also seem to suggest that other high period orbits do not exist . in consequence , it can be argued that the relation ( [ eq - opert ] ) is true .",
    "this decaying behavior toward the exponential distribution is essentially maintained in the extension of this model for more general random markets .",
    "let us suppose a one - dimensional ideal gas of @xmath0 non - identical classical particles with masses @xmath68 , with @xmath2 , and total maximum energy @xmath5 .",
    "if particle @xmath4 has a momentum @xmath69 , we define a kinetic energy : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the square root of the kinetic energy @xmath72 . if the total maximum energy is defined as @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 we see that the system has accessible states with different energy , which can be supplied by a heat reservoir",
    ". these states are all those enclosed into the volume of the @xmath0-sphere given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - ee ] ) .",
    "the formula for the volume @xmath75 of an @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath76 is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the gamma function . if we suppose that each point into the @xmath0-sphere is equiprobable , then the probability @xmath79 of finding the particle @xmath4 with coordinate @xmath71 ( energy @xmath80 ) is proportional to the volume formed by all the points on the @xmath0-sphere having the @xmath4th - coordinate equal to @xmath71 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath81 which is normalized , @xmath82 .",
    "the maxwellian distribution is obtained in the asymptotic regime @xmath16 ( which implies @xmath17 ) : @xmath83 with @xmath18 being the mean energy per particle and where the index @xmath4 has been removed because the distribution is the same for each particle .",
    "then the equilibrium velocity distribution can also be obtained by averaging over all the particles .",
    "we start by assuming a one - dimensional ideal gas of @xmath0 non - identical classical particles with masses @xmath68 , with @xmath2 , and total energy @xmath5 .",
    "if particle @xmath4 has a momentum @xmath69 , newly we define a kinetic energy @xmath72 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - p_i ] ) , where @xmath71 is the square root of @xmath72 .",
    "if the total energy is defined as @xmath73 , we have @xmath84 we see that the isolated system evolves on the surface of an @xmath0-sphere .",
    "the formula for the surface area @xmath85 of an @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath76 is @xmath86 where @xmath78 is the gamma function .",
    "if the ergodic hypothesis is assumed , that is , each point on the @xmath0-sphere is equiprobable , then the probability @xmath79 of finding the particle @xmath4 with coordinate @xmath71 ( energy @xmath80 ) is proportional to the surface area formed by all the points on the @xmath0-sphere having the @xmath4th - coordinate equal to @xmath71 . it can be shown that @xmath87 which is normalized . replacing @xmath88 by @xmath89 , @xmath90 takes the following form @xmath91 in the asymptotic limit @xmath16 , @xmath92 this is the typical form of the maxwellian distribution , with @xmath93 given by the equipartition theorem .      here ,",
    "as we have done in the anterior case of economic systems , we present a new model to explain the maxwellian distribution as a limit point in the space of velocity distributions for a gas system evolving from any initial condition @xcite .",
    "consider an ideal gas with particles of unity mass in the three - dimensional ( @xmath94 ) space .",
    "as long as there is not a privileged direction in the equilibrium , we can take any direction in the space and study the discrete time evolution of the velocity distribution in that direction .",
    "let us call this direction @xmath95 .",
    "we can complete a cartesian system with two additional orthogonal directions @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath97 represents the probability of finding a particle of the gas with velocity component in the direction @xmath95 comprised between @xmath98 and @xmath99 at time @xmath48 , then the probability to have at this time @xmath48 a particle with a @xmath94 velocity @xmath100 will be @xmath101 .",
    "the particles of the gas collide between them , and after a number of interactions of the order of system size , a new velocity distribution is attained at time @xmath50 . concerning the interaction of particles with the bulk of the gas , we make two simplistic and realistic assumptions in order to obtain the probability of having a velocity @xmath55 in the direction @xmath95 at time @xmath50 : ( 1 ) only those particles with an energy bigger than @xmath102 at time @xmath48 can contribute to this velocity @xmath55 in the direction @xmath95 , that is , all those particles whose velocities @xmath100 verify @xmath103 ; ( 2 ) the new velocities after collisions are equally distributed in their permitted ranges , that is , particles with velocity @xmath100 can generate maximal velocities @xmath104 , then the allowed range of velocities @xmath105 $ ] measures @xmath106 , and the contributing probability of these particles to the velocity @xmath55 will be @xmath107 . taking all together we finally get the expression for the evolution operator @xmath49",
    "this is : @xmath108    let us remark that we have not made any supposition about the type of interactions or collisions between the particles and , in some way , the equivalent of the boltzmann hypothesis of _ molecular chaos _",
    "@xcite would be the two simplistic assumptions we have stated on the interaction of particles with the bulk of the gas .",
    "then , an alternative framework than those usually presented in the literature @xcite appears now on the scene .",
    "in fact , it is possible to show that the operator @xmath49 conserves in time the energy and the null momentum of the gas .",
    "moreover , for any initial velocity distribution , the system tends towards its equilibrium , i.e. towards the maxwellian velocity distribution ( 1d case ) .",
    "this means that @xmath109 with @xmath110 . in physical terms , it means that for any initial velocity distribution of the gas , it decays to the maxwellian distribution , which is just the fixed point of the dynamics . recalling that in the equilibrium @xmath111 , with @xmath28 the boltzmann constant and @xmath29 the temperature of the gas , and introducing the mass @xmath42 of the particles , let us observe that the maxwellian velocity distribution can be recovered in its @xmath94 format : @xmath112 in general ,",
    "it is observed that the convergence of the @xmath49-iterations of any distribution @xmath113 to its gaussian limit @xmath114 is very fast .",
    "we have shown that the boltzmann factor describes the general statistical behavior of each small part of a multi - component system whose components or parts are given by a set of random variables that satisfy an additive constraint , in the form of a conservation law ( closed systems ) or in the form of an upper limit ( open systems ) .",
    "let us remark that these calculations do not need the knowledge of the exact or microscopic randomization mechanisms of the multi - agent system in order to reach the equiprobability . in some cases",
    ", it can be reached by random forces , in other cases by chaotic or deterministic causes .",
    "evidently , the proof that these mechanisms generate equiprobability is not a trivial task and it remains as a typical challenge in this kind of problems .    in order to explain the ubiquity and stability of this type of distributions two models based on discrete mappings in the space of distributions have been proposed .",
    "on one hand , the gas - like models interpret economic exchanges of money between agents similarly to collisions in a gas where particles share their energy . the continuous version of a gas - like discrete model where the agents trade in binary collisions has been introduced to explain the stability of the exponential distribution in this kind of economic systems . on the other hand , a nonlinear map acting on the velocity distribution space of ideal gases , which gives account of the decay of an out - of - equilibrium velocity distribution toward the maxwellian distribution , has been presented .",
    "some properties concerning the dynamical behavior of both operators have also been sketched .",
