    "in this paper we focus on a very promising approach to industry compatible plasma diagnostics , the so - called plasma resonance spectroscopy . this approach attempts to exploit the natural ability of plasmas to resonate on or near the electron plasma frequency @xmath0 for diagnostics purposes .",

    ", on the other hand , result from the interaction of the plasma with the electric field alone ; they utilize resonances below @xmath1 which are not present in vacuum ( standing surfaces waves ) and deduce the plasma parameters from the absolute value of the frequency @xcite . finally , _",
    "one - port concepts _ utilize probes with only one electrical input / output port @xcite , while _ two - port concepts _ use a probe configuration with two ports or even two separate probes @xcite .",
    "( multi - port concepts would also be conceivable . )",
    "many groups have dealt with simulation and modeling of specialized aspects of such diagnostic devices to achieve a better understanding of the resonance behavior @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the purpose of this manuscript is to study the whole class of active , electrostatic methods in order to gain a deeper physical understanding of the resonance behavior .",
    "therefore , we use a general description based on functional analytic methods which allows for an analysis without particular assumptions on the probe geometries or the homogeneity of the plasma .",
    "we represent the plasma chamber ( see figure [ abstractmodel ] ) as a simply connected , spatially bounded domain @xmath2 , most of which is plasma ( a simply connected subdomain @xmath3 ) .",

    "taking also into account the insulating surfaces @xmath8 , the boundary conditions for the potential are of mixed type : @xmath23    the currents @xmath24 carried by the electrodes are the measured signals of the diagnostic . as  the electrodes are shielded from the plasma , at least by the sheath , the currents are carried by displacement alone . counting them positive when they flow from the electrode to the plasma ( in the direction of the negative surface normal ) , one obtains @xmath25    of course",

    "the euclidian product is not available .",
    "however , a physically reasonable quadratic form exists , i.e. , the energy @xmath74 , which is stored in the capacitance and the inductance of the resonant circuit .",

    "( it is advantageous to allow for complex states . ) in dirac s bra - ket notation we define an appropriate function space as @xmath88 for two system states @xmath89 and @xmath90 we define a scalar product @xmath91 which is motivated by the inner energy functional .",
    "the following hermitian form is compatible with the dynamical equations and satisfies all requirements of an inner product , namely i ) conjugate symmetry , ii ) sesquilinearity , and iii ) positive definiteness . @xmath92",
    "the scalar product defines a corresponding norm @xmath93 .",
    "the norm - square of a state is equal to its inner energy , up to a factor of two @xmath94 equipped with this scalar product , and suitably completed , the defined function space of all possible states forms a hilbert space @xmath95 .",
    "it should be noted that the elements of @xmath95 are not all regular functions .",
    "the charge part may contain also singular functions like surface charges .",
    "however , this is acceptable as long as the norm @xmath93 is finite .    one important family of states @xmath96 can be obtained from the characteristic vacuum functions @xmath97 which have only a current part , their charge part and also the corresponding potential are equal to zero , @xmath98 the scalar product of @xmath96 with a system state @xmath71 is an expression for the inner current @xmath52 which is carried by the electrode @xmath9 . utilizing the definition of the scalar product one obtains @xmath99    the dynamical equations and can be written in a compact form @xcite .",
    "we define two dynamical operators @xmath78 and @xmath80 which act on the hilbert space @xmath95 .",
    "the conservative operator @xmath78 contains the effects of the electron inertia and the electric field ; it is defined by the action @xmath100 @xmath78 can be shown to be anti - hermitian , i.e. , @xmath101 ( see appendix ) . thus the associated eigenvalues are purely imaginary and represent the frequency behavior . the dissipative operator @xmath80 contains the effects of the collisions @xmath102 it can be shown that @xmath80 is hermitian , i.e. , @xmath103 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the eigenvalues are negative definite , @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , they are real and contain information about damping of the system . with the help of these definitions , the dynamical equations and of the system",
    "can be written as @xmath105 applying a fourier transform to this abstract form and solving for @xmath71 , the measured current can be obtained @xmath106 thus , the response function , can be written as @xmath107    the main result of this analysis is that the response function @xmath108 is given by the matrix elements of the resolvent of the dynamical operator equation evaluated for values on the imaginary axis .",
    "the result can be ultimately interpreted using equivalent lumped element circuits as described above .",
    "with this result and the insights gained from the simple application of the formulated theory , we are able to discuss the result of the abstract model , given by equation in terms of a lumped element circuit model . for a one - port probe ( we account for two electrodes plus ground ) the current to one of the two powered electrodes is given as @xmath109 comparing the response function @xmath108 with the one in reveals the same structure .",
    "it represents the coupling between the powered electrodes directly and the coupling from each electrode to ground . in this case , the dynamical operator @xmath110 is not a matrix as in the simple example , but a functional operator .",
    "the current is able to flow on infinite different paths through the plasma , each path can be expressed by a series resonance circuit .",
    "therefore , the response function represents an infinite number of series resonance circuits connected in parallel .    in summary ,",
    "the complete equivalent circuit consists of a branch which represents the direct coupling between the two powered electrodes .",
    "two additional branches mimic the parasitic coupling of the electrodes to ground or `` infinity '' .",
    "each branch itself is complex , and the relation between the plasma and probe parameters and the values of the circuit elements are generally very complicated .",
    "this case is depcited in figure [ abstractrcl ] . for realizations with more than one port",
    "the coupling gets even more complex .    under strictly electrical and geometrical symmetry",
    "the situation for a one - port probe becomes simpler .",
    "it can be shown via a @xmath111-y transform ( circuit theory ) that the coupling to ground or `` infinity '' vanishes .",
    "as the field decays quickly with increasing distance from the probe , the measurements become actually local .",
    "the equivalent circuit becomes more simple : an infinite number of series resonance circuits , each of which representing a discrete resonance mode , are connected in parallel to a vacuum coupling .",
    "the multipole resonance probe proposed by the authors @xcite fulfills these requirements to a great extent  it consists of two separated hemispherical electrodes covered by a dielectric shielding .",
    "thus its geometry is approximately symmetric ( with respect to rotations around the center of the probe ) and its electrical behavior is completely symmetric ( with respect to the mapping @xmath112 and @xmath113 . additionally , the spherical geometry allows for a compact mathematical description of the resonance behavior and simple algebraic expression for its resonance frequencies .",
    "we have formulated a model of electrostatic active resonance spectroscopic methods in terms of a functional analytic approach .",
    "the abstract character of these methods allow for a generalized model where the geometrical and electrical details of the probe realization do not enter explicitly in the equations .",
    "we presented a general analytic solution for the system state that gives physical insight in the resonance behavior . the scalar product between this state and the observation vector was shown to be the inner current at one electrode .",
    "part of the current is the inner admittance that is determined as a matrix element by the resolvent and the observation vector .",
    "this result can be interpreted in terms of a lumped element equivalent circuit . to guide the physical interpretation of the functional analytic approach this method",
    "was explicitly used to obtain the systems response of a idealized situation , i.e. , that the equivalent circuit is described by a simple rcl - series circuit .    as an example we presented the equivalent circuit of an one - port probe .",
    "an analysis of this circuit allows for an optimization of the probe geometry . due to a symmetrical geometry and a symmetrical applied voltage it is possible to transform the circuit in an equivalent circuit of one branch between the two electrodes",
    "this branch is given by an infinite number of parallel series resonance circuits and each represents a resonance mode parallel to a vacuum coupling .",
    "of course the presented theory can be extended in many ways .",
    "for instance , the influence of a magnetic field or kinetic effects may be taken into account .",
    "the magnetic field is negligible in the described theory as long as the skin depth is greater than the influence region of the probe and the gyration frequency is not in the range of the resonance frequency .",
    "a kinetic treatment of the electrons becomes important if the pressure is in the range of a few pa and lower .",
    "first attempts to establish a kinetic theory based on functional analytic methods are in progress .",
    "non the less , the authors applied the formulation to the _ multipole resonance probe ( mrp ) _",
    "@xcite which is the optimized concept .",
    "its application area in a dielectric depositing plasma process is an advantage compared to a langmuir probe .",
    "measurements with the prototype of the mrp in a double icp @xcite have shown the feasibility of this concept and were in very good agreement with a langmuir probe .",
    "in the following , the balance equations and their relations will be formally derived . the calculations utilize the facts that the particle current vanishes at the electrodes due to the dielectric shielding , the total inner current is divergence - free , the @xmath97 are the characteristic functions defined by eq . and",
    "employs the boundary conditions of @xmath16 and @xmath43 .",
    "+ the vacuum current can be expressed via capacitance coefficients in the following form @xmath114 it can also be shown , that kirchhoff s law of current conservation is conserved .",
