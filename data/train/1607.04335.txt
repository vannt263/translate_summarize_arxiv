    "complex networks and multi - agent systems , are very active fields of research .",
    "they entail the study of networks of interacting agents whose structure is irregular , complex and dynamically evolving with time @xcite .",
    "most real systems in biology , chemistry , engineering , socioeconomics , are made up of millions and millions of interacting agents ( i.e atoms , electrons , people as the case may be ) which account for fluctuations in the overall behaviour of the system . over the years",
    ", it has also been discovered that non - linear mathematical models replicate the dynamics of real systems better than the linear ones @xcite .",
    "an example of such former models is the lotka - volterra model @xcite , and its generalisation @xcite , which is also known as the prey - predator model @xcite .",
    "the lotka - volterra model has been used in various ways to model complex systems@xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the model was used in e - commerce web sites in a competitive scenario to explore its effects and the characteristic of `` rich gets richer '' on internet economy , and the  winner - takes - all \" phenomenon .",
    "this was an improvement on @xcite where interacting agents where discovered to be  sharing the market \" .",
    "the verhulst - lotka - volterra model was generalized in @xcite through the introduction of a non - linear , symmetric interaction function , used to investigate a competitive scenario .",
    "this resulted in a self - organising clustering of agents , which were either chaotic or / and non chaotic in nature as a result of their dependence on the agent s size and their initial state conditions .",
    "cooperative scenarios examined in @xcite were modeled individually without imposing any  market condition \" .",
    "this resulted in the growth of different clusters of interacting agents beyond their capacity in contrast to the competitive case . a complex network representation of the competitive and the cooperative scenarios was presented in @xcite , in order to give another description of some generalized verhulst - lotka - volterra model .",
    "this present paper offers new insights on the effects of competitive and/or cooperative interaction in a multi - agent system when @xmath0 agents have some common resources to share in the  market \" .",
    "the main contribution of our paper is two folds : firstly , we generalize the verhulst - lotka - volterra model by introducing a network effect through an undirected but weighted graph .",
    "the weights suitably represent competition or cooperation .",
    "the elements of the resulting adjacency matrix replaces the strength parameter in the interaction function of the@xcite model in order to enable a mixed - type of interactions , i.e. , having a system in which competitive and cooperative scenarios are considered to occur simultaneously amongst the various interacting agents .",
    "secondly , we introduce a market capacity in the model to replace individual agent s capacity : this is a realistic constraint , i.e. , the maximum level which all the agents may reach in the market , like in verhulst model of limited population growth @xcite- thereby enforcing a natural ( endogenous ) limit on agent s size growth .",
    "such competition , cooperation and mixed - type of interactions are analyzed below for triad interacting agents through the evaluation of the eigenvalues of the relevant jacobian matrix computed at corresponding fixed points , in order to investigate the system stability .",
    "this triad system has been chosen as the most simple yet complex enough as representative of basic networks @xcite .",
    "notice that the model goes well away for the 2-player prisoner ( dilemma ) game .",
    "thus , a mixed - type of interactions between agents , made possible through the network effect in the generalized verhulst - lotka - volterra model , markedly differs from previous works @xcite , and seems more realistic .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the generalized verhulst - lotka - volterra model is discussed .",
    "section 3 contains the outline of the mathematical model used in this paper .",
    "the fixed point analysis and state stability are investigated in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "initial size conditions and convergence to a steady state of the triad interacting agents are further illustrated through simulations .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of growth and/or decay effects in various scenarios , - sometimes rather complex , but _ a posteriori _ understandable .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 6 .",
    "it appears that the model is suitable for describing not only an  economic market \" but other agent based cases such as co - autorship , or more generally team working , or any other small or large network based complex systems .",
    "a generalized verhulst - lotka - volterra model introduced in @xcite is given by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the size of agent @xmath3 such that @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is its time derivative ; @xmath6 is agent s growth rate if no interaction is present , @xmath7 is the agent s maximum capacity and @xmath8 is the interaction function . the first term is a verhulst - like term @xcite and the others stem from the lotka - volterra model @xcite .    the interaction function @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 ; \\label{2b}\\ ] ] it is a continuously differentiable function that allows a proper theoretical analysis of the system dynamics leading to conclusions which will appear to be likely model independent .",
    "the positive parameter @xmath10 controls or scales the intensity of agent size similarity and the parameter @xmath11 determines the scenarios of agent s interaction .",
    "the model is used in @xcite to analyze a system of @xmath0 agents in competition for some common resources with competition becoming more aggressive between agents with similar size .",
    "this is because as @xmath12 , the interaction function @xmath13 for a constant parameter @xmath10 , its maximum value .",
    "the competition weakens when agents have distinctly different sizes , thereby suggesting a peer - to - peer competition modelling .    for the peer - to - peer interaction system , presented in @xcite , a strength parameter @xmath11",
    "was introduced : @xmath14 was considered to show the presence of competition in the market , while @xmath15 implied cooperation . under the cooperative scenario",
    ", the interaction function is defined in the interval @xmath16 . in order to avoid complexity and instability of the system ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 was chosen carefully through fixed point analysis of agents with equal sizes@xcite , whose eigenvalues are @xmath17 so that , the @xmath11 range interval @xmath18 ensures the stability of the system .",
    "this paper is a study of the verhulst - lotka - volterra model when competition and cooperation can occur between linked agents .",
    "the market capacity @xmath19 becomes the amount of product / service sales that could be reached within a certain period of time by any agents in the  market \" @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the individual agent s maximum capacity @xmath7 and @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20 so that the initial verhulst - lokta - volterra model becomes : @xmath21 in addition , interaction among agents is introduced and modeled by a matrix @xmath22 with elements @xmath23 , which are zero on the diagonal , and can be + 1 or -1 off the diagonal .",
    "thus , the interaction function becomes : @xmath24\\ ] ] with @xmath25 .",
    "this matrix @xmath22 is the adjacency matrix of a network represented by a weighted and undirected graph .",
    "the weights are @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicate no interaction , cooperation and competition respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is no loop , that is , an agent can not compete or cooperate with herself .",
    "for some special matrices @xmath22 , we obtain the model in @xcite .",
    "for instance , when @xmath28\\ ] ] we obtain the full competitive scenario as in @xcite . for @xmath29,\\ ] ] this is the full cooperative scenario @xcite .",
    "in addition the network matrix @xmath30\\ ] ] ensures a mixed - type of interaction amongst the agents in the model , when @xmath31 takes the value + 1 or -1 .",
    "that is , when competition and cooperation occur simultaneously amongst interacting agents in the system .",
    "for example , for @xmath32 , in our model , we can have two agents collaborating in order to compete effectively with the third agent .",
    "this can be compared with the case of two small companies collaborating to compete against a big company which had previously monopolized the market or when two political parties merge together for the purpose of winning over a ruling ( or over a potentially ruling ) party in an election or when scientific teams or authors cooperate on some research topics .",
    "thus suppose that there exist @xmath0 agents sharing some common resources .",
    "let us assume that agents increase in size if they acquire some portion of the resources or have their size reduced if any market portion is lost .",
    "our mathematical model is defined by an @xmath0-dimensional differential equation : @xmath33 s_{i}s_{j } , \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad i = 1 ,   \\ldots , n \\label{2f}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the agent size such that @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is its time derivative ; @xmath6 is the growth rate of agent @xmath3 if no interaction is present ; @xmath19 is the market capacity and @xmath36 is the element of the network matrix @xmath22 which determines the interaction between agent @xmath3 and @xmath37 .",
    "the interaction function @xmath8 is composed of dynamic parameters that result from the difference between agents in relation ; the parameter @xmath10 is a positive parameter that regulates the difference in the agent s size .",
    "note that while @xmath22 indicates what interaction is present , @xmath10 determines the  range \" of interaction of the agents .",
    "indeed , in contrast to the  large \" interaction between equal size agents , the intensity of interactions between  agents with bigger market share \" and  those with small market share \" occurs to be weak , since as @xmath38 , the interaction function @xmath39 ; on the contrary , indeed , as @xmath40 , @xmath41 depending on @xmath36 , which signifies a strong interaction between agents with similar sizes .    for the sake of simplicity , without much losing generality , it can be assumed that the agents have the same dynamic properties @xmath42 , while the market capacity can be @xmath43 .",

    "in this section , we present results from numerical simulations emphasizing the initial conditions and the convertgence of triad agent sets for all interesting and possible scenarios , for each network matrix type @xmath141 .    for the sake of clarity , in fig [ fig : graph ]",

    "we have verified the coherence of results .",
    "this suggested to us to present only cases when the initial conditions of agents sizes are rather different or quite similar , assuming a constant parameter that controls the size similarity , @xmath146 .",
    "the dynamic change in agent s size and relative behavior have been observed for each scenario .",
    "finally , note that agent s sizes initial conditions were chosen within a small interval in order to allow some  meaningful \" interaction amongst the agents ; since within our model , indeed , as @xmath38 , the interaction function @xmath39 .      the fully competitive scenario with different initial conditions for the agent s size is observed in fig [ fig : competitive scenario ] with a consideration on dynamical change in the agent size ; the market eventually ends in a monopoly .",
    "for all the permutations of the initial conditions , the agent that starts with the highest initial size , i.e @xmath148 , eventually monopolizes the market by attaining the market capacity , while the other two agents fade out of the market .",
    "this is possible because the two agents with smaller sizes compete too weakly with the agent that eventually dominates the market .    on the contrary ,",
    "when agents sizes are similar in fig [ fig : competitive scenario ] , the competition becomes very  fierce \" and all agents are struggling for their survival in the market . after some time span",
    ", it is observed that the agents eventually have an equal share of the market ; their total market share is however lower than the market capacity .",
    "thus , strong competition among peers is shown to lead to a reduction in the aggregate output due to the selfish interest of the individual agents .",
    "indeed , observe that the final state ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "convergence is generally slower in the competitive scenario when compared with the other scenarios due to the nature and effect of competition amongst the interacting agents .      the fully cooperative scenario ( @xmath150 ) is analyzed for different initial sizes of the triads and illustrated in fig [ fig : cooperative scenario ] .",
    "the cooperation amongst the agents enables all agents to grow in size up to this market capacity , thereby increasing the total market size , - which is the essence of cooperation @xmath151 .",
    "a simple analogy can be drawn with the case of publishing research in journals with a demand of just three papers in a journal edition ( i.e. market capacity ) .",
    "for simplicity , let it be assumed that the three authors have the same quality standard ( i.e. initial condition ) , under full competition , each author will have one article published making up three papers .",
    "however , the  best \" situation occurs under full cooperation when each author cooperates in writing the articles ; they eventually have three papers each published to their credit .",
    "hence , the final result will be three papers for the editor and three papers for each author .",
    "one other example pertains to car owners who may own more than one car , e.g. , three cars from three different manufacturers .",
    "these simple examples show that the agent s sizes can intersect each other during full cooperation .",
    "the simulation leads to the same effect , even if the initial conditions are permuted amongst the triads and when the agents have similar initial sizes as shown in fig [ fig : cooperative scenario ] .",
    "also , agents tend to `` quickly agree '' , thereby converging within a short time lapse .      the mixed interaction scenario ( @xmath120 ) , when agent @xmath55 competes with agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 themselves in cooperation is shown in fig [ fig : mixed a ] - fig [ fig : mixed b ] for different permuted initial conditions of agent s sizes .",
    "it can be observed that in all simulations , the sizes of agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 in cooperation grow dynamically with time up to the market capacity but agent @xmath55 decreases in size until it fades out of the market .",
    "the most interesting simulation is seen in fig [ fig : mixed b ] , with different initial conditions @xmath152 where agent @xmath55 initially possesses the biggest share of the market with @xmath153 , competes with the two other agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 that alternate a smaller size @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "note that the sum of the two initial shares of the cooperating agents is lower than the share of the competing agents .",
    "interestingly , after some time , the collaboration between agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 knocks out agent @xmath55 from the market .",
    "an example of this scenario was experienced in 2015 in the nigerian political history , where a political party that ruled the country for 16 years after democracy was restored , was defeated in a tight competition between the incumbent president and an aspirant that emerged from a strategic collaboration of three smaller political parties@xcite . however ,",
    "this is not possible if the intensity of interactions is very low amongst the agents ; that is , when @xmath55 is  extremely bigger \" in size when compared to agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 .",
    "when all the agents have similar initial conditions , the pattern is similar with agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 totally taking over the market by growing up to the market capacity as seen in fig [ fig : mixed b ] .      finally , the second possible case of mixed interaction scenario ( @xmath124 ) is shown in fig [ fig : mixed 2a ] - fig [ fig : mixed 2b ] ; agent @xmath55 cooperates with agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 themselves in competition , for different permuted initial conditions of agent s sizes .",
    ".summary of the effect of initial size conditions for the various scenarios as obtained from simulations , i.e. changing the relative initial sizes of the agents [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    when agent @xmath55 cooperates strongly with the agent with a higher initial condition and cooperates weakly with the other one .",
    "the effect of cooperation makes agent @xmath55 ( irrespective of its initial condition ) and any one of the two agents that cooperates strongly with agent @xmath55 grows up to the market capacity , while the effect of weak cooperation and competition between agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 makes the agent with the lowest initial condition vanishing from the market .",
    "surprisingly , when the three agents have the same initial size , the simulation turns out interesting also , as seen in fig [ fig : mixed 2b ] , - unlike the first case of mixed interaction .",
    "when agent @xmath55 cooperates strongly with agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 which are in strong competition with each other , the effect of this strong and opposite interaction in the system results in a final state in which no agent is attaining the market capacity , but each agent nevertheless grows above its initial size ; all three agents remained active in the market .",
    "a summary of the simulations of the triad interaction agents is presented in table 1 .",
    "the characteristic values pertain to agent s size initial conditions , final size and the time of convergence .",
    "it can be observed that convergence is slower during competition , due to the conflicting interests of interacting agents ; in contrast , during cooperation , agents tend to  agree \" , thereby converging within a shorter time lapse . for the mixed interaction cases , when agent @xmath55 competes with agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 in cooperation , a scenario with two collaborating agents in conflict with one , the time of convergence is seen to be faster than when agent @xmath55 cooperates with agents @xmath56 and @xmath48 in competition : this can be understood due to the collaborative effect of mixed interactions being higher in the first case than in the second case .      in conclusion of this simulation results section",
    ", we would like to further emphasize the two most interesting cases @xmath124 and @xmath150 , from a qualitative point of view in this subsection , and for a practical point of view , considering a time scale reasoning , in the next subsection , [ timescale ] .",
    "it can be usually noticed that the size evolution is rather smooth , - in fact remembering the ( positive or negative ) logistic behavior found from verhulst equation .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing that the double pair cooperation ( @xmath124 ) can lead to a non - smooth evolution ; see fig [ fig : mixed 2b ] .",
    "observe the figure with different initial sizes , in particular , the evolution of agent @xmath56 which starts with the lowest initial size .",
    "its size first increases , but reaches a maximum ; thereafter , due to the cooperation of agent @xmath55 and agent @xmath48 , agent @xmath56 is removed from the market , - even though agent @xmath55 ( which started with the biggest size ) cooperates with agent @xmath56 . _ in fine _",
    ", @xmath55  prefers to cooperate \" with @xmath48 , - and eliminate agent @xmath56 , because @xmath55 and @xmath48 , starting in the most advantageous positions .",
    "this situation does not need to be explicitly illustrated with many practical cases ; it occurs of course in economic markets , like when two top soda companies ( coca - cola and pepsi - cola , sorry for such a publicity ) wish to control a country market .",
    "the same occurs in scientific competition : a well known case of war between ( usa ) famous laboratories occurred after the discovery of the high @xmath156 superconducting ceramics @xcite . in sport ,",
    "cooperation ( within theoretical competition ) in order to win a race leads to temporary cooperation ; see cyclism races @xcite or sumo wrestling @xcite competitions .",
    "competition and cooperation between political parties in order to form a coalition have already been mentioned .",
    "the other interesting case is found when all agents start with same sizes in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed 2b ] .",
    "they all start to grow , but the two competing agents with each other , agent @xmath56 and agent @xmath48 , loose their impetus to agent @xmath55 however cooperating with both of them . in this case ,",
    "agent @xmath56 and agent @xmath48 are @xmath157 removed from the market , but only reach some level yet above their initial size .",
    "of course , in so doing , agent @xmath55 does not reach the full market capacity .",
    "this  bumpy behavior \" is reminiscent of the behavior found when , in verhulst equation , the growth rate and/or the capacity are / is time dependent @xcite .",
    "such a mapping into time dependent extensions of the parameters in verhulst equation is of course outside the aim of the present paper and is left for further work .",
    "even though qualitative aspects of cooperation / competition behavior seem well described , it seems of interest to discuss whether the control parameters of the size evolution are reasonable .",
    "first recall that @xmath158 in eq.([2a ] ) was chosen to be equal to 1 .",
    "this growth rate parameter takes values of the order of 0.04 @xmath159 for steady populations , like in usa , e.g. , in the last century .",
    "indeed , one could estimate that the possible bearing time of a woman was about 25 years , and during that time she would bear one child who would be surviving .",
    "therefore in a strict verhulst model , the rise in ( population ) size , going roughly from 0 to 1 on the size axis , and from 1 to 10 , on the simulation scale time axis , according to all the presented figures , proposes a growth rate @xmath160 , - thus roughly twice as large as in reality .",
    "it is easy to observe that the time scale due to the competition parameter is rather measured through the ratio @xmath161 ; see eq.([2f ] ) . since we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath162 , the previous reasoning holds , leading to a convincingly reasonable value of @xmath163 for most cooperation / competition scenarios in real life .",
    "it seems reasonable to consider that the simulation scale is measured in usual time spans : years to hours . from the various examples that we have pointed out as applications , it is obvious that the cooperation / competition mixed cases occur over different time horizons , - whence scaling the various @xmath164 strengths .",
    "in this paper , the verhulst - lotka - volterra model for competition and cooperation was extended through the introduction of some notion hereby called  market capacity \" , in place of the individual agent s own capacity , thereby imposing a limit on agent s size growth .",
    "this improves previous studies in which agent s capacity are modeled individually , - studies which resulted in agents unrealistically growing above their capacity in a fully cooperative scenario .",
    "the present model has emphasized the basic plaquette of a network , a triad system ; it was chosen as a simple yet complex representative of any network through which some properties of the model can be investigated analytically .",
    "in addition to this , through simulations , dynamic changes in the agent s size and relative behavior are observed , for all ( 4 possible ) scenarios .",
    "we have emphasized that the initial relative sizes of agents is very relevant for the evolution of the system , leading to market sharing , or sometimes removal of agents form the  market \" .",
    "interesting scenarios occur even if the initial size of agents are similar . when the initial sizes are quite different , the steady is of course more quickly reached .",
    "we have emphasized that in some scenarios , a non smooth behavior can be found .",
    "the influence of initial conditions on the co - evolution of networks has been in this respect pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we consider that the model allows to describe the evolution of various types of agents , and is a basis for investigating more complex networks .",
    "we have pointed practical cases of interest throughout the text ; recall co - authorship behavior in scientific publications , political manipulations along democratic lines , the cases of sport in which individuals from different teams can cooperate against rivals and reach a better status , in so doing . as pointed out by porter : _  the presence of multiple rivals and strong incentives influences the intensity of competition among firms / agents ; yet , competition and cooperation can coexist because they are on different dimensions or because cooperation at some levels is part of winning the competition at other levels\"_.    other examples where the model can be useful may be found , beside general aspects @xcite , in econophysics , like when there is cooperation in financial or food price speculation @xcite , in auction collusions @xcite , or in practical economic life , e.g. when two companies decide to tie up over the introduction of autonomous driving taxi @xcite .",
    "notice that cooperation can also be corruption @xcite , but can also be used to resist speculation .",
    "the case of false , i.e. misleading cooperation could also be interestingly considered , but needs further work , data , and debate .        beside including time dependence of the interaction parameters , external field effects , memory @xcite and learning @xcite effects could be included in further studies .",
    "moreover , the simultaneous up - dating might be challenged for a sequential up - dating in order to find more complex behaviors . in particular ,",
    "we have pointed out that destruction of agents may occur ; in contrast network growth can allow for creation of agents .",
    "this is relevant to observe our extension of the basic vlv modeling : the most interesting difference between agent - based herding model and lotka - volterra model is the possibility of investigating systems with a variable number of agents .    finally , asymmetric interactions , e.g. removing the constraint due to the square of the exponential in eq.([2b ] ) would be highly interesting .",
    "can it be _ in fine _ pointed out that the above matrices could be asymmetric , thus sometimes , with complex eigenvalues @xcite , whence possibly cyclic behaviors .",
    "indeed , so called alternating and cut - off ways of cooperation can be envisaged @xcite .",
    "many developments and much work are obviously ahead .",
