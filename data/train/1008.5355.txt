    "moreover , there are many dynamically defined homeomorphisms from certain dynamically defined subsets of @xmath0 to other subsets of @xmath0 . perhaps the first such result was a homeomorphism from the @xmath1-limb of @xmath0 to a subset of the @xmath2-limb of @xmath0 constructed by branner and douady @xcite ; this class of homeomorphisms was later extended by riedl @xcite .    in @xcite ,",

    "these homeomorphisms preserve the embedding into the plane so that they even extend to neighborhoods of these limbs within @xmath5 , preserving the orientation @xcite .",
    "all these homeomorphisms are constructed by quasiconformal surgery , and they all change the dynamics of the associated polynomials so that in general , periods of hyperbolic components are changed .    at about the same time , it was observed @xcite that there is a combinatorially defined bijection between the limbs @xmath3 and @xmath4 that preserves periods of hyperbolic components , and it was conjectured that this would yield a homeomorphism between these limbs that preserved periods of hyperbolic components . an early attempt to prove this conjecture by quasiconformal surgery resulted in another proof of the theorem from @xcite that stayed within the quadratic family .",
    "a proof of this conjecture is the main result of the present paper ; it can be stated as follows .    for any hyperbolic component of @xmath0 , let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two limbs with equal denominators .",
    "then there exists a homeomorphism between them that preserves periods of hyperbolic components .",
    "since our homeomorphism preserves periods of hyperbolic components , it can not extend to neighborhoods of the limbs .    for a fixed @xmath6 consider the arrangement @xmath7 of all hyperbolic components with periods up to @xmath8 ( see figure [ figure : combmand ] for an example ) .",

    "it is known ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.10 ) that an angled internal address uniquely describes a combinatorial class , where finite addresses correspond to hyperbolic classes . on the other hand",
    "the internal address describes a combinatorial class up to the `` symmetry '' .",
    "for example , hyperbolic polynomials have the same internal addresses if and only if the dynamics of the polynomials on the julia sets are topologically conjugate ; this topological conjugation extends to a neighborhood of the julia set , preserving the orientation , if and only if the two polynomials have the same angled internal address .",
    "internal addresses are strictly increasing ( finite or infinite ) sequences of integers starting with @xmath27 .",
    "not every such sequence occurs for a combinatorial class of the mandelbrot set : those that occur are called `` complex admissible '' .",
    "an explicit characterization of the complex admissible sequences was given in @xcite .",
    "the following theorem shows the `` valency of the symmetry '' :    [ th : anglintaddr ] if an angled internal address describes a combinatorial class in the mandelbrot set , then the numerators @xmath88 can be changed arbitrarily ( coprime to @xmath89 ) and the modified angled internal address still describes a combinatorial class in the mandelbrot set .    in other words ,",
    "complex admissibility is a property of internal addresses , not of angled internal addresses .",
    "in fact , any internal address uniquely determines the denominators @xmath89 of any associated angled internal address , while theorem  [ th : anglintaddr ] says that the numerators @xmath88 are completely arbitrary ( coprime to @xmath89 ) .",
    "consider a small copy @xmath90 of the mandelbrot set , and assume @xmath91 is the main hyperbolic component of @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath91 has a finite angled internal address : @xmath92    [ th : smallcop ] a combinatorial class @xmath71 belongs to the small copy @xmath90 if and only if the angled internal address of @xmath71 is @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",

    "this result can be expressed as follows : for a given combinatorial class @xmath71 , there are usually many hyperbolic components @xmath98 , and most of them are not associated to the internal address of @xmath71 . for those that are not , @xmath71 is in the @xmath1-limb of @xmath29 .",
    "in this , section , we prove the main theorem in an apparently stronger form : consider hyperbolic components @xmath35 and @xmath36 with identical internal addresses",
    ". then we will construct a homeomorphism between the limbs @xmath48 and @xmath99 , where @xmath97 .",
    "the original statement of the main theorem describes the case @xmath100 .",
    "this more general version can easily be deduced from the statement of the main theorem , because there is a unique hyperbolic @xmath91 at which the angled internal addresses of @xmath35 and @xmath36 branch off , in the sense that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are contained in two different limbs at angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 of @xmath91 , with @xmath97 ; a possibly repeated application of the main theorem will then yield the statement we are proving here , and it shows that the statement remains true for @xmath101 , i.e. , for the limbs @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the reason why we are giving an apparently more general proof is because the proof really is the same , and this illustrates the general nature of the argument .",
