    "the goal of designing and constructing quantum computers based on quantum dots requires characterization of all their physically relevant properties . for this",
    ", it is necessary to have a full toolbox of experimental diagnostics - in this case , one electron excited - state lifetime measurements as a function of external parameters such as temperature and magnetic field , and to be able to interpret these measurements in the light of theory .    in this paper",
    "we present calculations of the dominant spin relaxation processes in ideal silicon quantum dot spin qubits @xcite along with calculations for orbital and valley relaxation .",
    "our particular emphasis is decay due to phonon coupling , since this mechanism is believed to be responsible for @xmath4 across wide parameter regimes relevant to quantum information applications .",
    "we will indicate in detail how it can be distinguished experimentally from other mechanisms .    a full ,",
    "experimentally verified theory of the energy relaxation processes of the excited electronic states in silicon quantum dots is important for several reasons .",
    "first , it accomplishes a major step on the experimental path to determining the quantum coherence times of isolated spins in silicon ( a preeminent goal in the verification of a qubit ) .",
    "second , it helps corroborate our understanding of the material system and better characterizes the device under scrutiny ; an example would be transport spectroscopy of nearby energy levels and their line widths .",
    "third , it provides necessary parameters needed for the design of future experiments , systems , and architectures . indeed , if the dominant spin qubit relaxation mechanisms are as we predict",
    ", we can not only validate the @xmath4 lifetimes of silicon qubits , but also retrieve the relative magnitudes of the dominant spin - orbit coupling contributions inherent in the device ( important for both silicon quantum computing and silicon spintronics applications ) , as well as the nature and energies of the various states above the two spin - qubit states .",
    "finally , the lifetimes of excited orbital states are relevant to optical pumping schemes , many - phonon decoherence calculations , transport spectroscopy , beyond single - spin qubit implementations @xcite , and other areas of quantum control .",
    "it has long been known that localized spins in silicon can have exceedingly long lifetimes , even at relatively high temperatures ( @xmath5 2k ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of spin decoherence times are notoriously difficult as many mechanisms can relax a spin , even in the more robust case of direct energy relaxation , or @xmath4 processes , where a quantum of energy is lost to the environment . in silicon , for example , energy relaxation processes may depend on the many - valley nature of the conduction band electrons ; neglecting this effect leads to incorrect predictions ( to many orders of magnitude ) @xcite .",
    "the key realization came in 1960 from roth @xcite and , independently , hasegawa @xcite - that spin mixing to the ( 1s - like ) valley manifold states explains the ",
    "fast relaxation observed for donor electrons .",
    "soon after , _ _ feher , gere , wilson _ _ _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and castner @xcite thoroughly fleshed out the experiments and theories of donor state lifetimes in silicon .",
    "castner was the first to calculate relaxation across different valley donor states .",
    "this body of work was the basis of some of the first proposals for electron spin qubits in silicon as a basis for a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "this reinvigoration of the field has led to the extension of these original relaxation theories to new nanostructures like donors and quantum dots in strained silicon @xcite and in iii - v quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the region of qubit interest in our case refers to a spin qubit with finite magnetic field , well below any degeneracy with higher orbital or valley states .",
    "we can summarize the key results of this paper and prior work on qubit relaxation relevant to qubit and quantum computer design in silicon quantum dots as follows :    1 .",
    "we are concerned with the lifetimes of excited states of a 0-dimensional ( 0d ) localized electron in silicon .",
    "the relaxation of 1d and 2d mobile electron spins has been investigated for spintronics applications .",
    "this has led to some misconceptions about electron spin relaxation in 1d and 2d vs. 0d .",
    "they are in fact very different . for mobile electrons",
    ", scattering plays the key role @xcite , and spin rotation between or during scattering events is the driver of loss of spin memory  ( dyakonov - perel and elliott - yafet effects @xcite ) .",
    "this normally leads to spin lifetimes on the order of microseconds in silicon @xcite .",
    "since scattering is not an issue in 0d , this is an unjustified worry for spin qubits for silicon quantum computers .",
    "however , spin lifetime measurements in silicon quantum wells can help determine relevant spin - orbit coupling parameters needed for quantum spin relaxation calculations .",
    "spontaneous emission of a phonon is the dominant mechanism determining the spin - flip time , @xmath4 ( @xmath4 being the characteristic time for true energy relaxation to the environment via a phonon or photon ) , at temperatures around 100 mk .",
    "photon emission is negligible because of the much lower density of final photon states .",
    "phonon emission accompanied by a spin - flip occurs due to spin - orbit mixing within the crystal . of the `` bulk '' roth @xcite and hasagawa @xcite mechanisms that are relevant for donors in unstrained silicon ,",
    "the  valley repopulation mechanism disappears with increasing [ 001 ] strain as is common in silicon quantum wells @xcite .",
    "one - valley mechanism goes to zero if the magnetic field is parallel to one of the three crystallographic axes , and goes as @xmath6 for other directions @xcite .",
    "3 .   the effect of germanium in a sige qd heterostructure is not significantly detrimental to relaxation times for growth - typical ge concentrations @xcite ( in the virtual crystal approximation ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in lateral si quantum dots comes predominantly from structural inversion asymmetry ( sia ) and symmetry - breaking due to interface effects leading to both rashba - like and dresselhaus - like soc terms @xcite .",
    "( the relative magnitude of dresselhaus - like and rashba - like soc in silicon quantum wells or dots has yet to be verified experimentally , let alone systematically across samples . )",

    "this contrasts sharply with gaas quantum dots and si donor states .",
    "for these two cases @xmath10 ( though for different reasons ) .",
    "the ratio of the rashba - like and dresselhaus - like terms are expected to be sample dependent since in silicon they are due solely to interface effects ( silicon , unlike iii - vs , has no bulk - inversion asymmetry ( bia ) ) . 5 .   direct coherent rotations due to nearby spins in the semiconductor are possible .   1 .   at zero and low magnetic fields ,",
    "direct dipole - dipole magnetic coupling with the central electron qubit and other electrons in the environment can occur .",
    "these rotations are technically coherent processes , but they result in spin flips that change the longitudinal component of the qubit magnetization and thus appear like @xmath4 processes .",
    "these processes do not depend on @xmath9 and can set upper limits on observed @xmath4 times .",
    "the strength of this interaction is reduced as the inhomogeneity of the electron line widths increases , though even one electron spin exactly at resonance 200 nm away can cause 200 ms effective @xmath4 lifetimes .",
    "a full theory is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "2 .   at zero fields ,",
    "direct electron qubit - nuclei flip - flops are possible leading to @xmath4-like rotation . at finite fields this mechanism",
    "is suppressed due to the mismatch of the electrons and nuclei respective g - factors .",
    "these mechanisms may in some cases be corrected via spin - echo techniques or suppressed by freezing out the background spins 6 .",
    "other mechanisms for longitudinal spin relaxation , @xmath4 , such as hyperfine coupling to si@xmath11nuclei in natural si , 1/f noise , and johnson noise , are estimated to be small in the parameter ranges considered here , though further work is required to verify this .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of these effects allows them to be distinguished from spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the phonon bottleneck effect operates rather weakly in the parameter regime of interest for quantum dot applications .",
    "it can be calculated in a theory that goes beyond the electric dipole approximation ; the result is only a slight enhancement of @xmath7 8 .",
    "orbital relaxation in strained silicon is much faster than in bulk silicon in some important cases .",
    "surprisingly , the rate of spontaneous decay from the first excited orbital state in silicon quantum dots can be comparable to that of gaas quantum dots , which are commonly expected to relax more efficiently due to that crystal s piezoelectric nature .",
    "this has important implications for optically - induced motional spin - charge transduction ( readout ) and optical pumping ( initialization ) of spin qubits @xcite , making the former harder and the latter easier , as well as for excited state spectroscopy .",
    "excited valley state relaxation can be slow in silicon due to a small matrix element connecting valley states of different symmetry ; this leads to the hope of valley qubits @xcite .",
    "the phonon emission rate has a maximum at the umklapp phonon energy ( 11 mev and 23 mev for transverse and longitudinal phonons in silicon ) that connects valley minima from one brillouin zone to its nearest neighbor @xcite .",
    "this leads to  at the longest ",
    "nanosecond relaxation times @xcite in p donors with their large valley splitting ( ~10 mev ) , but in quantum dots is suppressed due to a large energy mismatch .",
    "however , the valley index in general can not be considered a good quantum number in quantum dots due to large valley - orbit mixing @xcite .",
    "for the same reason ,  valley relaxation in realistic devices can be dominated by orbital relaxation due to mixing with nearby orbital levels .",
    "the situation is different and more favorable in some cases such as for li donors @xcite .",
    "non - ideal interfaces in silicon quantum dots may effect the relaxation processes ; these effects are microscopic in origin @xcite and are not considered quantitatively in this paper .",
    "this content is arranged as follows .",
    "we begin with an introduction to the single electron states in silicon quantum dots typical of heterostructures used for qubits today .",
    "we follow with a discussion of the electron - phonon interaction , the dominant relaxation mechanism in these devices .",
    "we then use that theory to calculate the orbital relaxation ( no spin flip ) of low - lying excited states to states having the same valley index .",
    "we do this first using the electric - dipole ( ed ) approximation and then including all multipoles .",
    "this gives useful numbers for excited orbital state lifetimes as well as a quantitative idea of the extent of validity of the ed approximation in further calculations .",
    "then the main subject of this paper is tackled , namely the spin flip mechanisms relevant to quantum dots . in this section ,",
    "we review and adapt the previously known ",
    "bulk spin - flip mechanisms to the quantum dot case .",
    "we then consider new mechanisms due to structural inversion asymmetry which give the dominant spin relaxation mechanisms for most of the magnetic field range .",
    "this is followed by comparisons with spin relaxation mechanisms ( noise , nuclei ) and valley relaxation , which completes the narrative of excited lifetimes in single electron quantum dots relevant to quantum computing .",
    "where possible we compare the results for quantum dots with those for p donors in silicon and gaas quantum dots , both of which are relevant reference systems .",
    "the final section summarizes the relation of theory to experiment .",
    "it is difficult to make sharp predictions for the absolute magnitude of @xmath4 because of strong dependences on quantities that are usually somewhat uncertain , particularly the dot size , as well as a reliance on bulk material constants which may vary in nanostructures .",
    "we show how to overcome this problem by combining measurements of qubit spin lifetimes with measurements of excited orbital state energies and lifetimes .",
    "it is precisely for this reason that we deal in such detail with the excited states .",
    "this work is concerned mainly with lateral quantum dots formed by heterostructure confinement in the growth ( @xmath12 ) direction and lateral confinement by metallic top gates .",
    "figure 1 shows some of the heterostructure choices possible in constructing these dots , from modulation doped two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) structures depleted by top gates to accumulation mode inversion layer devices in mosfet - like structures .",
    "we will concern ourselves here predominately with the sige qw qd case , although our considerations should carry over to si mosfet dot structures as well .    in semiconductors ,",
    "the electron wave functions are superpositions of bloch states at the bottom of the conduction band ( cb ) , so the indirect band - gap , `` many - valley '' nature of silicon ( as opposed to a single @xmath13-valley in gaas ) takes on great importance . in a biaxially - strained silicon",
    "qw , the number of states is doubled relative to gaas , but reduced from the 6-fold degeneracy of electrons in the bulk . the conduction band ( cb ) minima located at @xmath14 with @xmath15",
    "have band energies lower than the minima at @xmath16 and @xmath17 by about 0.1 to 0.15 ev at typical strain values ( 20 - 30% ge in the barriers ) @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath14 valleys are populated but not the @xmath17 and @xmath16 valleys @xcite .",
    "a similar splitting is at work in si mosfet - type structures , though here the physical origin of the lifting of the degeneracy is due to anisotropy of the silicon effective mass ( and in some cases local strain ) . in the absence of magnetic fields and valley - splitting effects ,",
    "the electronic ground state in this system is four - fold degenerate ( spin and valley ) .",
    "when potentials or boundary conditions that mix the two valleys are present , as they always will be to some extent , there will be excited valley states corresponding to different linear combinations of the valley minima .",
    "so each valley state has its own identical set of orbital and spin states and an additional quantum number is needed to specify which valley state the electron occupies .",
    "a magnetic field splits the degeneracy of the spin states .",
    "the valley degeneracy is split by the hard confinement of the qw interfaces ( or the impurity potential in that case ) and is influenced by a number of parameters , especially the magnitude of the electric field in the growth direction and the sharpness of the confining potential . for the moment , we assume for simplicity that any static magnetic field is small or directed in the plane of the qw ( so that the orbital functions are unperturbed ) and that the well walls , located at @xmath18 are smooth . in these circumstances , we may write @xmath19.\\ ] ] @xmath20 is the envelope function obtained by solving the confinement problem in the effective mass approximation for the @xmath21-th orbital , @xmath22 are the coefficients weighting the two valleys for the @xmath23-th valley state ( @xmath24 for strained silicon , @xmath25 for bulk silicon ) , and @xmath26 are the lattice - periodic parts of the bloch functions , @xmath27 , at the conduction band minimum @xmath28 .",

    "is shown in figure [ fig : the - circled - numbers ] .",
    "until now we have only concerned ourselves with ",
    "perfect(completely flat ) interfaces . in these cases",
    "the valley and orbital states are well defined - valley index being a generally good quantum number - much like the isolated donor case . in reality",
    "most interfaces are imperfect ; they have alloy disorder ( si vs. ge atoms ) , steps due to miscut , steps due to growth layer formation , and even interface states and traps ( especially with respect to si / sio@xmath35 interfaces ) .",
    "this leads to mixing of the valley and orbital wave functions as well as diminishing of the valley splitting ( due to interference ) @xcite , and as such , wave functions and splittings that vary from device to device and dot to dot .",
    "these microscopic variations are not considered in this paper .",
    "fortunately , these effects are often not large corrections to the calculations below , as the experimentally accessible energy splittings come into the equations at a much higher power than the relevant ( experimentally inaccessible ) matrix elements .",
    "as we go we will point out differences from our theory for the ideal and likely situations , focusing on experimentally accessible signatures .",
    "phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations , that is , mechanical motion that gives time - dependent stress .",

    "distortion of the lattice can also create large internal electric fields which affect the electron .",
    "this is the piezoelectric interaction .",

    "figure [ fig : valley relaxation ] explicitly shows the valley relaxation rate in the two cases of fixed @xmath49 wave function height and wave function height that changes accurately with electric field and valley splitting .",
    "it turns out that the bloch coefficients to the nearest valley at @xmath62 are most efficient and phonons are then emitted in the @xmath12 direction . as @xmath49 gets compressed , not only does the valley splitting increase due to interface scattering ( approaching the ",
