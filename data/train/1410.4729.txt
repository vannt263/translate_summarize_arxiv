    "we assume the interface to be macroscopically thin , having surface tension sufficiently large to keep the fluid interface flat in the flow .",
    "frankel and acrivos @xcite established that in highly concentrated three - dimensional suspensions subjected to shear flow the dominant contribution to the viscous dissipation rate comes from the gaps between neighboring particles .",
    "they found that the asymptotic rate of viscous dissipation in the fluid with shear viscosity @xmath19 between two spheres approaching each other with relative velocity @xmath20 is given by formula @xmath21 the derivation was based on the exact solution of stokes equations by brenner @xcite .",
    "further terms in the expansion ( [ eq : e_3d ] ) can be obtained using the asymptotic expansion of lubrication force given by jeffrey @xcite .",
    "we consider the system with a flat particle - laden interface which is symmetric with respect to the interfacial plane @xmath22 .",

    "this condition is satisfied if there is no additional adsorbed species at the interface , such as surfactants . in the case of different viscosities",
    "there is a stress jump across the interface .",
    "it is straightforward to show that tangential traction at the interface equals zero for the flow symmetric with respect to the axis that joins the centers of two particles .",
    "the normal traction due to pressure jump is compensated by surface tension if it is strong enough , so that the interface remains flat . for this to occur",
    ", the laplace pressure , @xmath23 @xmath24 being surface tension , must be large compared to the pressure difference at the interface between two fluids . in lubrication flow the excess pressure in the fluid is of order @xmath25 , yielding the pressure jump @xmath26 the condition @xmath27 can be cast in form latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : alpha - condition }    interface is flat if dilatation rate @xmath1 is small enough .",
    "this condition is satisfied in most practical situations involving colloidal particles .",
    "thus , if the condition ( [ eq : alpha - condition ] ) is satisfied there is no additional traction due to presence of the interface between the fluids . as a result",
    ", the velocity field remains the same as for the one - fluid problem without the interface .",
    "viscous dissipation in the domain occupied by each bulk fluid will be proportional to the value of corresponding shear viscosity .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic rate of viscous dissipation in the system can be written as a sum of the contributions from each bulk fluid , @xmath29    in order to calculate the effective dilatational viscosity we shall follow the approach pioneered by einstein @xcite and equate expressions for the rate of viscous dissipation calculated in two ways .",
    "first , we consider the system as homogeneous , having an effective continuum interface with effective surface dilatational viscosity @xmath5 .",
    "second , we consider the energy dissipation in presence of particles explicitly .    the energy dissipation rate due to dilatational surface flow in a homogeneous surface characterized by dilatational viscosity @xmath5 is @xcite @xmath30 where the @xmath12 area of the interface . in our case @xmath12",
    "equals the area of the hexagonal array of @xmath11 particles : @xmath31 substituting @xmath32 in accordance with eq .",

    "substituting eqs  ( [ eq : phi_m ] ) , ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] ) yields @xmath36    equating two expressions for the energy dissipation rate , ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : e_p ] ) , we finally obtain the formula for the effective dilatational viscosity at large concentration of particles , @xmath37 this result , together with the low - concentration asymptotics given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta - low ] ) , is plotted in figure  [ fig : zetas ] .",
    "asymptotic behavior of dilatational viscosity at low [ line a , eq .  ( [ eq : zeta - low ] ) ] and high [ line b , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta - high ] ) ] particle concentrations .",
    "crosses correspond to the numerical results by edwards and wasan @xcite . ]",
    "the derivation presented in the previous section is based on the idea put forward by frankel and acrivos @xcite , who suggested that fluid flow in the gaps between neighboring particles gives the dominant contribution to the viscous dissipation rate in the highly concentrated suspension , and used this idea to calculate the effective shear viscosity of highly concentrated three - dimensional suspensions of solid spherical particles .",
    "we shall now discuss possible caveats of this model and their implications on our result .",
    "frankel and acrivos considered arrangement of particles in a lattice of fixed geometry . to reconciliate their results with the experimental data , they employed the semiempirical cage model @xcite to calculate viscous dissipation rate and found that the best agreement with the available experimental data is achieved for the cubic arrangement of the particles .",
    "however , a condition of fixed particle arrangement is not fulfilled in shear flow , and is at best an instantaneous configuration .",
    "this fact together with non - uniqueness of the cage model makes the result by frankel and acrivos empirical and requires fitting to the experimental data . returning to our system we note that , in contrast to shear flow , surface dilatational flow conserves hexagonal arrangement of the particles on a surface , so there is no need in empirical parameters in our model .",
    "berlyand _ et al _ @xcite considered fluid flow in highly concentrated strictly two - dimensional suspensions and found that in two dimensions different types of singular terms should be considered for adequate description of the divergence of the dissipation rate . in our case",
    "this complication does not arise because , although particles are arranged on a 2d plane , fluid flow between them remains three - dimensional .",
    "moreover , of four types of flow considered in ref .",
    "[ ] , namely , the squeeze , the shear , and two types of rotation , only the squeezing flow , considered in our derivation , is present in purely dilatational flow .",
    "marrucci and denn @xcite analyzed the result by frankel and acrivos and concluded that for the realistic configurations of particles the averaging over relative pair positions of the particles is incorrect , and the models based on regular lattice may present a misleading picture of suspension behavior . in our case",
    "the deviation of particles configuration from hexagonal lattice also requires separate analysis .",
    "however , presence of the repulsive interaction between particles sufficient to make them non - brownian removes this , otherwise complicated , problem .",
    "edwards and wasan @xcite presented the results , shown in figure  [ fig : zetas ] , on the effective dilatational viscosity obtained by numerical solution of stokes equations for the case of adsorbed spherical particles arranged in a square lattice .",
    "it is not surprising that the high - concentration results are higher than for hexagonal arrangement of particles because the distance between particles arranged in a square lattice is less .",
    "it is less clear why the data at lower concentrations is , being larger than predicted by low - concentration formula ( [ eq : zeta - low ] ) , changes slower than proportionally to the particle concentration @xmath16 .",
    "estimation of the concentration ranges at which the limiting formulas for the dilatational viscosity , eqs  ( [ eq : zeta - low ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta - high ] ) , are accurate , requires separate investigation . a simple criterium for the applicability of the high - concentration formula ( [ eq : zeta - high ] ) can be obtained by requiring viscous dissipation in lubrication gaps between particles to be large compared to the rest excess dissipation in the surrounding fluids .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to the condition of dilatational analog of saffman - delbrck length @xcite , @xmath38 being large compared to the characteristic length for the excess dissipation outside lubrication gaps , which is of order of the particle size @xmath9 . expressing eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta - high ] ) in terms of @xmath15 and substitiuting the result in inequality @xmath39 yields @xmath40 which is consistent with the initial assumption that the lubrication gap should be small compared to the size of the particles .",
    "we have obtained asymptotic expression for the effective surface dilatational viscosity of a flat interface separating two immiscible fluids laden with half - immersed monodisperse rigid spherical particles at high concentration of the particles .",
    "the derivation is based upon the facts that ( i ) highly - concentrated particle arrays in a plane form hexagonal structure , and ( ii ) the dominant contribution to the viscous dissipation rate arises in the thin gaps between neighboring particles .",
    "dilatational viscosity is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta - high ] ) and diverges as @xmath41 , where @xmath15 is the distance between neighboring particles surfaces .    it should be possible to verify this result by direct experimental measurements . in the case of oscillatory",
    "flows the present result , obtained for the case of stationary flow , represents a low - frequency limit of frequency dependent dilatational viscosity .",
    "the result can be extended in several ways .",
    "it should be possible , with different degrees of complexity , to extend the hydrodynamic model to the cases of different particle shapes , size distributions , different contact angles between the particles and the fluid interface , different curvatures of the interface , combined shear+dilatational flow ( _ eg _ such as in langmuir trough ) , and so on . if particles adsorbed at the fluid interface are small ( `` nanoparticles '' ) , physical effects not captured by the simple hydrodynamic model become important and require further investigation , for example , thermal motion of the particles and the interface @xcite , or modification of fluid viscosity due to confinement @xcite and viscoelectric @xcite effects .    the model for the dilatational viscosity can be used in conjunction with appropriate model for interparticle interactions to describe viscoelasticity of particle - laden interfaces @xcite .",
    "the present result should allow extending the description of viscoelastic properties to the case of high concentration of the particles ."
