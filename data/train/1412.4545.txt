    "with the purpose of better understanding the dynamics of core - collapse supernova and the observed neutron star characteristics , a considerable theoretical effort has been undertaken in recent years concerning the modelization of the equation of state ( eos ) of cold dense matter with some extensions to finite temperature .    if it is well admitted that hyperonic and deconfined quark matter could exist in the inner core of neutron stars , a complete understanding of its composition is far from being achieved .",
    "concerning hyperons , simple energetic considerations suggest that they should be present at high density  @xcite .",
    "however , in the standard picture , the opening of hyperon degrees of freedom leads to a considerable softening of the eos  @xcite , which in turns leads to maximum neutron star masses smaller than the highest observed values  @xcite .",
    "this puzzling situation could be circumvented by a very early deconfinement transition  @xcite , or by the population of other baryonic states such as @xmath2-baryons pushing the hyperon onset to higher densities .",
    "the latter , however , only replaces the hyperon puzzle by a @xmath2 puzzle  @xcite unless a phase transition to quark matter is simultaneously invoked .    without calling upon such a transition",
    ", it has been shown that the observed neutron star masses simply imply that the hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath3 ) and hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) couplings must be much more repulsive at high density than presently assumed ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the general agreement is , however , that the price to pay for this additional repulsion is a very low strangeness content of neutron stars  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown , that at least in non - relativistic models , this is strongly parameter dependent and that neutron stars with a considerable amount of hyperons can exist .",
    "another argument put forward against hyperons is that the strong repulsion needed , has its implications in the purely nuclear part , too , leading to large radii for neutron stars , larger than those suggested for intermediate mass neutron star by recent observations  @xcite . in many models with hyperons",
    "compatible with the neutron star mass constraint , see e.g.  @xcite , indeed relatively high radii of about 14 km for a non - rotating spherical neutron star with the canonical mass of @xmath1 are obtained .",
    "this can , however , not be a general argument since there are some examples with lower radii  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the generic presence of attractive and repulsive couplings suggests the existence , in a model - independent manner , of a phase transition involving strangeness .",
    "a detailed study of the phase diagram of dense baryonic matter was recently undertaken in refs .",
    "@xcite within a non - relativistic mean - field model based on phenomenological functionals .",
    "it was shown that under these assumptions first- and second- order phase transition exist , and are expected to be explored under the strangeness equilibrium condition characteristic of stellar matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a phase transition has been discussed for relativistic mean field models , but within a model with very strong @xmath3 attraction .",
    "here we are interested ( a ) in examining in which region of parameter space within rmf models a first order phase transition from purely nuclear to hyperonic matter could exist and if the existence of such a phase transition is compatible with experimental and observational data , ( b ) if it is possible to obtain high mass neutron stars with considerable amount of hyperons and ( c ) in finding additional support for hyperonic eos with radii of 12 - 13 km for canonical @xmath1 neutron stars and maximum masses in agreement with observations .",
    "we will work at zero temperature throughout the whole paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we discuss the model applied and the setup for the hyperonic interactions .",
    "we explain the procedure to detect thermodynamic instabilities in sec .  [",
    "sec : thermo ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lambda ] we present results for neutron star matter containing nucleons , electrons and @xmath5 hyperons .",
    "we extent the discussion to the full baryonic octet in sec .",
    "[ sec : fulltov ] and we close the paper by a summary of results in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "the literature on phenomenological rmf models including hyperons is large and many different versions exist ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , including either non - linear couplings or density - dependent ones of baryons to the meson fields mediating the interaction .",
    "let us stress at this point that , although they are generally called meson fields , these fields are purely phenomenological and only serve for describing the interaction without any relation with existing meson fields , except for the quantum numbers which give the names for the corresponding rmf meson fields .",
    "the lagrangian of the model can be written in the following form @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the field of baryon @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the vector meson field tensors of the form @xmath10 @xmath11 are scalar - isoscalar meson fields , coupling to all baryons ( @xmath12 ) and to strange baryons ( @xmath13 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 induces a scalar - isovector coupling .    in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the meson fields are replaced by their respective mean - field expectation values , which are given in uniform matter as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represents the third component of isospin of baryon @xmath21 with the convention that @xmath22 .",
    "the scalar density of baryon @xmath21 is given by @xmath23 and the number density by @xmath24 the effective baryon mass @xmath25 depends on the scalar mean fields as @xmath26 and the effective chemical potentials , @xmath27 , are related to the chemical potentials via @xmath28 the rearrangement term @xmath29 is present in density dependent models to ensure thermodynamic consistency .    for the present study we will limit ourselves to two non - linear models , gm1  @xcite and tm1 - 2  @xcite , and one density - dependent model , ddh@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the two non - linear ones have been chosen among the large number of models since they are two widely used ones , with a very different strategy for determining the parameters : gm1 has been adjusted to nuclear saturation properties imposing a certain effective mass and incompressibility , whereas tm1 has been fitted to ground state properties of nuclei and at high densities to dbhf calculations . for the gm1 parametrization ,",
    "@xmath31 = 0 , and the @xmath30-field is absent in gm1 and tm1 - 2 .",
    "the density - dependent models assume @xmath32 ( no non - linear terms ) and the following density dependence of the couplings is used within ddh@xmath30 @xmath33 with @xmath34 denoting nuclear matter saturation density and @xmath35 for all isoscalar couplings and @xmath36 - c_i ( x - d_i)~.\\ ] ] for the isovector ones .",
    "the parameter values for gm1 can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , table iii , for tm1 - 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , table i , and for the ddh@xmath30 model in ref .",
    "@xcite , table ii .",
    "the eos of homogeneous symmetric nuclear matter for parametrization tm1 - 2 is shown in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "it has the same properties as tm1 @xcite at and below saturation density , but it is stiffer at supra - saturation densities , still within the constraints imposed by heavy - ion flow  @xcite .",
    "however , within this parametrization the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation is very large , @xmath37 mev .",
    "since the radius of compact stars is very sensitive to @xmath38  @xcite , we will consider a modified version with @xmath39 mev  @xcite , too , introducing a non - linear @xmath40 term as in ref .",
    "the resulting properties of homogeneous symmetric nuclear matter are listed in table  [ tab : nuclear ] for all parametrizations employed within the present paper . in the same table",
    "we also include the value of the pressure of @xmath41-equilibrated cold neutron star matter at @xmath34 for reference . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a microscopic neutron matter calculation in the framework of a chiral effective field theory together with available information on symmetric nuclear matter have been used to build the eos of stellar matter , this value should lie in the range @xmath42 this range of pressures is the result of a quite restrictive allowed region for the symmetry energy ( 29.7 - 33.5 mev ) and its slope @xmath38 ( 32.4 - 57 mev ) at saturation .",
    ".__nuclear matter properties of the models considered in this study for symmetric nuclear matter at saturation , except for the last column where the pressure of stellar matter at @xmath34 is given _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1fractions ] we display the fractions of the different particles in neutron star matter as function of baryon number density within gm1 , varying @xmath43 and @xmath44 . as expected ,",
    "rendering the vector repulsion stronger by choosing a smaller value of @xmath43 , the respective hyperonic thresholds are shifted to higher densities .",
    "thereby , the cascade thresholds show a stronger @xmath43 dependence than the @xmath5-threshold .",
    "the reason is the stronger @xmath43-dependence of the individual hyperon - meson coupling constants , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : symmetry ] ) , induced by the symmetry requirements of the procedure used .",
    "it can be observed that all threshold densities for @xmath45 are significantly lower than those in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , hyperons are present at much lower baryon number densities . this can be explained by a different readjustment of the couplings to @xmath12 : we keep the values of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter , @xmath46 mev , @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev , constant when changing the value of @xmath43 . in addition , all the curves have been calculated with nonzero coupling to @xmath13 .    the observed dependence on the attraction furnished by @xmath13 is no surprise . increasing @xmath44 , the threshold density for hyperon @xmath21",
    "is lowered and its abundance is globally increased . in particular , on the right panel",
    "it can be seen that for a strongly attractive coupling of @xmath49-hyperons , although , due to the much higher mass of the @xmath49 with respect to @xmath5 , the latter threshold still remains the lowest one , at densities beyond the @xmath50-threshold , @xmath5-hyperons become the less abundant ones .",
    "this is again an example which shows to which extent the composition of the core of neutron stars depends on the interactions between different particles and the necessity of more experimental data to pin down the neutron star composition .",
    "the fractions of particles plotted in fig .",
    "[ fractm1 ] were calculated within tm1 - 2 ( @xmath37 mev ) and tm1 - 2 with the @xmath51 nonlinear term ( @xmath39 mev ) . in case of an existing instability",
    ", it is driven by the hyperon indicated in the name of the parametrisation , see table  [ tab : tm1cassig ] .",
    "some additional comments are in order :    * for the hyperon potentials chosen and taking for the isoscalar vector mesons the @xmath52 couplings , the first hyperon to set in is always the @xmath5 followed by the @xmath53 ; * increasing the strength of the @xmath54 coupling with respect to its @xmath52 value disfavors the onset of @xmath49 due to the large strangeness of these hyperons and the onset of @xmath5 is followed by the onset of @xmath55 ; * increasing the strength of the @xmath56 coupling with respect to its @xmath52-value will disfavor more strongly the onset of @xmath57 and @xmath5 , and , therefore , it may happen that the @xmath53 onset density is the lowest , mainly if @xmath39 mev , the latter having a larger @xmath58 favoring negatively charged hyperons ; * taking the smaller value of the symmetry energy slope , @xmath39 mev , the @xmath5-hyperons set in at larger densities , and the @xmath57-hyperons at smaller densities . the total strangeness inside the maximum mass star is smaller for the eos with smaller @xmath38 .",
    "we have investigated neutron star matter including hyperonic degrees of freedom within an rmf approach . for the nucleonic eos we have considered the gm1 parametrization @xcite , the ddh@xmath30 @xcite , and some variations of the tm1 parametrization @xcite with a smaller symmetry energy slope @xmath38 and/or a harder eos at large densities @xcite .",
    "the hyperon - nucleon interactions have been adjusted to existing experimental data .",
    "thereby we have followed two different strategies in the isoscalar vector sector : either symmetry constraints  @xcite have been imposed , relaxing the @xmath52-symmetry to fix the couplings as done in several recent works  @xcite or no particular symmetry has been assumed between hyperonic and nuclear couplings . for the hyperon - hyperon interaction , that in the present formalism is described through the mesons with hidden strangeness ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath59 , the couplings @xmath44 have been varied freely , and , in particular , they have been chosen strong enough to originate an instability with the onset of hyperons ; whereas for the coupling to @xmath59 , the prescription for the isoscalar vector sector has been followed .",
    "our main focus has been to study the possibility that an instability driven by the onset of hyperons could exist , the neutron star maximum mass , and the strangeness content of neutron star matter .",
    "we have looked at the radii of intermediate mass neutron stars with eos containing hyperons , too .",
    "the existence of an instability as trace of a first order phase transition was identified by analyzing the curvature of the thermodynamical potential with respect to the baryonic , strangeness and leptonic densities . in all our studies at most one negative eigenvalue , corresponding to the direction in density space , in which density fluctuations get spontaneously and exponentially amplified in order to achieve phase separation , has been found .",
    "first we have studied @xmath60 and @xmath5 matter in @xmath41-equilibrium , and showed that it was possible to choose a set of parameters that gives rise to an instability driven by the onset of @xmath5s and still predict a maximum star mass of the order of 2@xmath61 , and stars with a mass of @xmath62 with a radius of @xmath63 km .",
    "it was shown that the hyperon content is very sensitive to the attraction furnished by a coupling to @xmath13 and that the absolute value of the hyperon content is strongly model dependent .",
    "the @xmath64 calculations are far from excluding hyperons from neutron stars .",
    "the price to pay for having an instability is , however , a very strong @xmath5-@xmath5-attraction , which is in contradiction with the actual experimental information .    in a second step",
    "we have considered the whole baryonic octet .",
    "again , it was shown that a particular choice of the coupling parameters @xmath44 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 allowed the construction of eos giving rise to star masses as high as 2@xmath61 , which , in addition , predict the occurance of instabilities at the onset of hyperons . in particular , it was shown that it is possible to have an instability driven by the onset of the @xmath5 , the @xmath49 or the @xmath57 hyperons depending on the choice of the coupling parameters .",
    "the coupling parameters will also determine the different hyperon species and the strangeness fraction occuring inside a neutron star .",
    "presently , the scarce amount of experimental information on the hyperon sector , leaves too much freedom in adjusting the interaction parameters , to give a definite answer about the composition of neutron star matter with hyperons .",
    "it was also shown that the neutron star radii at intermediate masses depend mainly on the properties of the purely nuclear eos and considerable differences due to the presence of hyperons can be observed only for masses close to the respective maximum mass .",
    "the main parameter determining the radii at intermediate masses is the slope of the symmetry energy , @xmath38 , as found earlier  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that hyperons can be added to nuclear models with low symmetry energy and slope without violating the neutron star maximum mass constraint , and that in this way radii between 12 - 13 km can be obtained for neutron stars with the canonical mass of @xmath1 . from rather",
    "general arguments it seems indeed difficult to obtain even lower radii with an eos satisfying the maximum mass constraint  @xcite . in fact , for almost all the parameter sets considered , the @xmath5-hyperons appear first , and the hyperons are present only in stars with @xmath67 , such that the radius at @xmath68 is determined by the nuclear parameters .",
    "contrary to @xcite we could get hyperonic stars described within a rmf calculation with a mass @xmath69 or above , and still satisfying the semi - empirical constraint on the pressure of neutron star matter at saturation density  @xcite",
