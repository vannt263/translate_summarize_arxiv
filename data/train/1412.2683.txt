    "in this paper we discuss two different sources of effective metric : elastic media @xcite and topological matter with weyl or dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "we will consider the two dimensional graphene in the presence of elastic deformations as an example .",
    "let us start from the description of the deformations in @xmath0 elastic media that are described by metric field @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the displacement field , which describes the displacement of atoms from their equilibrium positions .",
    "here we have introduced the ( inverse ) vielbein of elasticity theory @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite instead of the of the displacement of the lattice knots , the system of the crystallographic coordinate planes @xmath6 has been used . in that case",
    "the vielbein represents vectors orthogonal to the planes , i.e. the vectors of the reciprocal bravais lattice . ) in terms of the displacement field @xmath4 one has : @xmath7 for small deformations , @xmath8 , the displacement field is expressed in terms of the elastic deformations and rotations : @xmath9 the curvature and torsion fields appear in the presence of dislocations and disclinations @xcite .",
    "the description of deformations in @xmath10 media ( graphene , the boundaries of topological insulators , etc ) coincides with that of the @xmath0 in case when there are no off - plane displacements of atoms ( except that the indices take the values @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , in the presence of the off plane displacements , when the considered surface is really curved , the description is different .",
    "let us denote the three - vectors that give the coordinates of the surface points by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 while @xmath16 is the displacement field .",
    "then , metric of elasticity theory is given by @xmath17 in terms of the displacement field @xmath16 one has : @xmath18 unlike the @xmath0 case the inverse vielbein @xmath19 can not be represented as @xmath20 because @xmath21 has three components .",
    "the point nodes ( zeroes ) in the energy spectrum of fermionic excitations are also described by the vielbein , but of different origin .",
    "the point node protected by topology is robust to the deformations of the system : it does not disappear under deformation , though the dirac cone is deformed and the position of the node changes .",
    "topological theorem ",
    "the atiyah - bott - shapiro construction @xcite  dictates the linear expansion near the nodal point @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the position of the weyl or dirac point , which for brevity will be further called dirac point .",
    "we use the representation for the coefficients @xmath24 in order to match the particular expression for the hamiltonian in graphene ( see below ) .    in the inhomogeneous system",
    "the expansion parameters become fields . the floating dirac point @xmath25 plays the role of the effective @xmath26 gauge field , and the coordinate dependent matrix @xmath27 coincides with the effective vielbein @xmath28 up to the factor @xmath29 that defines invariant integration measure over coordinates ( for the case of graphene see below , sect .",
    "[ secthom ] ) : @xmath30 further in @xmath31 d case we shall refer to @xmath32 as to the zweibein and to @xmath33 as to the vielbein .",

    "the emergent spin connection may appear , so that we deal with the emergent riemann - cartan geometry .",
    "however , in case of graphene in the leading approximation it will not appear , so that we are left with the effective gravity described by the emergent vielbein with vanishing spin connection .    in the solid state materials with dirac or weyl points in the fermionic spectrum",
    "there is an interplay of the two metric fields : elastic and fermionic .",
    "in particular , the deformations or local rotations of the crystal , which is described by the elastic gravity , causes the deformation of the fermionic vielbein , i.e. the fermionic gravity .",
    "we consider this effect on example of the 2d graphene .",
    "now let us come to the description of graphene .",
    "we start with homogeneous elastic deformation @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the uniformly strained crystal is periodic , and thus the expansion in eq.([elasticity2 ] ) with constant expansion parameters remains valid .",
    "since the pseudo - momentum @xmath36 remains a good quantum number , the homogeneous spectrum ( [ huniform ] ) is also valid .",
    "there are two fermi points in unstrained graphene @xmath37 . in the presence of elastic deformations the positions of these two points are changed and are given by @xmath38 .",
    "the definition of @xmath23 depends on the choice of coordinate system , i.e. on the parametrization of graphene surface . in @xcite",
    "the parametrization typical for the elasticity theory is used .",
    "namely , in the chosen parametrization of the surface the coordinates of carbon atoms are the same as in the unperturbed honeycomb lattice . in this reference frame",
    "we have @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is to be interpreted as the emergent @xmath26 gauge field : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the material gruneisen parameter while @xmath43 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the given parametrization is natural for the curved graphene surface .",
    "we refer to it as to the accompanying reference frame .    however , if the surface @xmath44 is curved only slightly and remains close to the ideal plane @xmath45 , the other parametrization is preferred , which is called typically the `` laboratory reference frame '' . in this parametrization",
    "the coordinates of carbon atoms are given by their projections to the plane @xmath45 .",
    "let us choose the third coordinate axis orthogonal to @xmath45 .",
    "then the transformation between the two parametrizations of @xmath44 is given by : @xmath46 here the laboratory reference frame coordinates are denoted by @xmath47 while the coordinates of the original reference frame ( accepted in @xcite ) are denoted by @xmath48 .      in laboratory reference",
    "frame the value of @xmath23 has two contributions : @xmath49 the first term in the right hand side of this expression contains the geometric contribution , which comes from the coordinate transformation of the original position @xmath50 of the dirac node in the non - deformed lattice .",

    "the definition of @xmath69 depends on the choice of coordinate system , i.e. on the parametrization of graphene surface . in the accompanying reference frame",
    "we have ( eq . ( 3.4 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath70 the second term in the right hand side of eq.([connection0 ] ) comes from the dependence of the hopping elements on the distances between the atoms in the lattice , which are changed under the deformation of the lattice .",

    "the terms @xmath75 in the rhs of eq.([connection1 ] ) are of the geometric origin : they come from the coordinate transformation from the original non - disturbed to the strained graphene .",

    "does not produce the pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "it can be eliminated by gauge transformation , which leaves only the gauge field @xmath78 . as a result",

    "the pure rotations that do not depend on coordinates ( @xmath82 ) leave the zweibein isotropic . to see that we may in addition rotate the internal space accordingly thus giving rise to the transformation of the pauli matrices @xmath83 . as a result",
    "we come back to the isotropic fermi velocity : @xmath84 .    in the accompanying reference frame ( in which the carbon atoms have the same coordinates as in regular honeycomb lattice )",
    "we have : @xmath85    from eq .",
    "( [ heffective2 ] ) it follows that the fermions living near to the two fermi points @xmath86 and @xmath87 have opposite charges with respect to the emergent gauge field @xmath40 .",
    "this is in contrast to the real electromagnetic field : fermions at both valleys have the same electric charge .",
    "let us consider how the emergent geometry is affected by dislocation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "both effective geometry of elasticity theory and the effective geometry experienced by fermions acquire the singular contributions to torsion concentrated at the origin @xmath88 of the dislocation . however , we shall see , that these contributions are different . at the origin @xmath88 of the dislocation",
    "the pair hexagon - hexagon may be substituted , for example , by the pair heptagon - pentagon .",
    "then the extra sequence of hexagons is added along the line @xmath89 that starts at the pentagon .",
    "for the low energy effective theory this results in cutting of the graphene surface along the line @xmath89 that begins at @xmath88 and goes to infinity",
    ". then the strip of a finite width is added along @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting surface is sewn along the cut . as a result in the accompanying reference frame ( where the coordinates of the atoms are the same as in the unperturbed honeycomb lattice )",
    "there is the uncertainty in the definition of the parametrization at the cut .",
    "this uncertainty gives nonzero value to the following integral along the contour @xmath90 surrounding @xmath88 : @xmath91    let us introduce vectors that connect a vertex of the unperturbed honeycomb lattice with its neighbors : @xmath92 also we define the following vectors : @xmath93 one can check that the allowed values of burgers vector are @xmath94 with integer values @xmath95 . in the mentioned particular case when the pair hexagon - hexagon is substituted by the pair heptagon - pentagon",
    "the burgers vector @xmath96 is equal to @xmath97 for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 .      in laboratory reference",
    "frame the dislocation is described in a different way .",
    "this parametrization of graphene surface does not contain ambiguity .",
    "the ambiguity in the parametrization of accompanying reference frame appears through the displacement field defined as a function of @xmath47 : @xmath101 ( off - plane displacements do not enter . ) the parametrization in accompanying reference frame is defined modulo the step - like discontinuity at the cut . therefore , although the displacement field @xmath102 has a step - like discontinuity concentrated along the cut , its derivative @xmath103 is continuous .",
    "the burgers vector is given by : @xmath104 we may choose , for example , the following representation : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the polar angle ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) while @xmath109 is continuous along the cut ( i.e. it does not contain the discontinuity along the cut ) .",
    "however , @xmath110 may be undefined at the origin of the dislocation .",
    "in the following we shall imply that the graphene surface is nearly flat and shall consider expressions for torsion and magnetic field carried by the dislocation in the laboratory reference frame , where there is no ambiguity in parametrization .",
    "it is useful to describe dislocation in this reference frame using the field of elastic vielbein that is regular along the cut and is undefined at the origin of the dislocation only . for small out of plane displacements",

    "when the off - plane displacement can not be neglected , tensor @xmath114 can not be identified with the elastic vlelbein , but it still can be used for the calculation of torsion and emergent magnetic field ( see below ) .",
    "the burgers vector is expressed through @xmath5 as @xmath115 this means that @xmath116    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ using ] ) is specific for the dislocation . at the same time",
    "@xmath110 may be or may not be related to the dislocation depending on external conditions . for brevity we shall consider the relatively simple case of suspended graphene in vacuum ( when there are no external forces at all ) .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in general case of the graphene layer placed on the substrate the connection between the substrate and the grapnene layer complicates the consideration .",

    "@xmath117 should be considered as the given function of @xmath118 , whose shape is fixed by external conditions . in principle , this function may also be singular at the position of the dislocation .      elastic part of the free energy of the thin plate may be written as @xcite : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the two - dimensional lame coefficients , @xmath122 , while @xmath123 is bending rigidity @xcite .",
    "we may neglect the term quadratic in @xmath124 in @xmath125 but can not in general case neglect the term quadratic in @xmath126 .",

    "the difference between the phases of the two solutions defined by paths @xmath236 and @xmath237 ended at the same point @xmath238 is defined by the winding number @xmath239 of the contour @xmath240 around the dislocation .",
    "the two given solutions differ by the phase factor : @xmath241 here @xmath242 is the total momentum of the quasiparticle ( that is the sum of the unperturbed fermi point @xmath243 and @xmath244 ) . for vanishing gruneisen parameter @xmath245",
    "we are left with especially simple result : for the contour winding once around the origin of the dislocation the phase is equal to @xmath246 .",
    "the description of the scattering problem of quasiparticle on the dislocation involves these multiple - defined wave functions .",
    "we do not give here the detailed description of the quantum - mechanical solution for the given scattering problem .",
    "let us notice only that this situation is similar to that of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "however , now momentum @xmath217 enters the expression for the phase factor of eq .",
    "( [ psi2 ] ) .",
    "this complicates the consideration . for the elastic scattering with small angles ( so that @xmath217 for the incoming and outgoing waves are equal ) the analogy is most valuable .",
    "we refer to the appearance of the phase in the wave function proportional to the product of winding number , particle momentum , and torsion concentrated within the loop as to stodolsky effect ( see below ) .",
    "measuring of the beam phase shift in the gravitational field ( that is expressed through both gravitational constant and plank constant ) was suggested by colella and overhauser in 1974 @xcite .",
    "this effect was discussed later in a number of papers ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "stodolsky @xcite derived an expression for the phase shift in the case of the gravitational field of general ( non - newtonian ) form that reveals an analogy to the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "therefore , we feel it reasonable to call the appearance of this phase ( proportional to the particle momentum ) the _ stodolsky effect_. notice , that in the form discussed here the condensed matter analogue of this effect differs from the usual gravimagnetic aharonov - bohm effect originated from the components @xmath247 , @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "the observation of this effect in graphene for the scattering of quasi - particle on the torsion singularity carried by the dislocation was proposed in @xcite ( in this respect in @xcite the first term of eq .",
    "( [ using ] ) was discussed while the contribution of @xmath110 was not considered ) .",
    "as distinct from the fundamental gravity , in the effective elastic gravity there is no diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the coordinate transformation describes real deformation of the lattice , which modifies the distances between the atoms . in the so - called `` laboratory reference frame '' ( in which the points of the surface are parametrized by the projections of their coordinates to a `` laboratory '' plain ) there are two sources of the response of the fermionic gravity to the elastic gravity : the geometric one , which is determined by the coordinate transformation ; and the material one , which is determined by the material grneisen parameters . at the same time in the `` accompanying reference frame '' ( in which the coordinates of the atoms are equal to their coordinates in the unperturbed lattice ) there is only the material contribution : the `` geometric '' one is eliminated by the transformation between the two coordinate systems .",
    "this should be taken into account , when the geometric methods are applied to the study of properties of topological solid - state or liquid materials . there",
    "the fictitious gravitational field is introduced in the newton - cartan formulation with localization of galilean invariance , see e.g. recent papers @xcite .",
    "our consideration of emergent geometry in the presence of dislocations demonstrates that the dislocation carries the singularity of torsion in addition to the finite flux of emergent magnetic field .",
    "the latter may be observed via the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the torsion singularity may also be probed by the scattering of quasipartcles on the dislocation .",
    "it manifests itself in stodolsky effect that is similar to the aharonov - bohm effect , i.e. the quasipaticle winding around the torsion singularity acquires the phase that is proportional to the torsion localized on the dislocation multiplied by the momentum of the incoming wave .",
    "the observation of a similar phase shift in general relativity was suggested in @xcite and discussed in a number of papers ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "stodolsky @xcite discussed the non - newtonian case , when the expression for the phase shift may be easily generalized to take the form considered here . in @xcite it was proposed to observe this effect in graphene for the scattering of quasi - particles on the dislocation .",
    "however , in @xcite only the torsion originated from the discontinuous part of the displacement vector ( the first term of eq . ( [ using ] ) ) was discussed . in the present paper",
    "we take into account torsion singularity originated from the second term of eq .",
    "( [ using ] ) given by the elasticity equations .",
    "this results in a correction to the phase acquired by the particle proportional to material parameter @xmath42 .",
    "notice , that unlike for the usual aharonov - bohm effect , the phase acquired by the particle when it surrounds torsion singularity is proportional to its momentum and depends on the direction of momentum .",
    "the particular distribution of dislocations simulates effective emergent magnetic field and effective torsion distributed within the graphene plane ( see also @xcite ) . in that case in addition to the torsion field originated from the derivative of the effective vielbein @xmath171 the extra contribution appears that is related to the distribution of dislocations .",
    "such a contribution may be interpreted through the appearance of spin connection @xmath249^a_b$ ] defined through relation @xmath250 } + t^a_{ij , { \\rm dislocations } } \\equiv \\big[d_{[i}e_{j]}\\big]^a , \\quad d_i= \\partial_i   + \\omega_i\\ ] ] ( here @xmath251 is the regular part of inverse vielbein .",
    "it is equal to @xmath252 with the singular contribution of dislocations subtracted . )",
    "the interrelation between the two types of metric considered here on an example of graphene may be extended to the other condensed matter systems with fermi points in the presence of elastic deformations .",
    "the example of such a @xmath10 system is given by the boundary of topological insulator .",
    "the example of the @xmath0 system is given by the weyl and dirac semimetals @xcite . in both these cases",
    "there exists the natural metric of elasticity theory that is determined by strain .",
    "however , the fermionic quasi - particles experience another metric given by the expansion of the effective hamiltonian near fermi point .",
    "the particular expressions for the emergent vielbein and emergent gauge field depend on the details of the considered systems and differ from the expressions for graphene considered above .",
    "notice , that unlike graphene in these cases the emergent spin connection may appear in addition to the emergent gauge field ( in the absence of dislocations ) .",
