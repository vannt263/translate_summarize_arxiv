    "in recent years , specially in view of an increasing interest in high @xmath0 operation scenarios , such as hybrid scenarios for iter @xcite , the impact of electromagnetic effects on the particle and heat transport has attracted much attention .",
    "here @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron density and temperature .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as the effective field strength @xcite .",
    "recent reports have shown the significant role of electromagnetic modes such as micro - tearing modes ( mtms ) on the electron heat transport in the core of fusion plasmas @xcite .",
    "it has been found that in plasmas where @xmath0 and collisionality are sufficiently high mtms can become the dominant instability . under these conditions ,",
    "mtms generate a major contribution to the anomalous electron heat flux .",
    "the mtms are small - scale in the radial direction , but ion - scale in the binormal direction .",
    "they are electromagnetic modes with an even parity with respect to the perturbed parallel vector potential , @xmath5 ( referred to as _ tearing parity _ ) . in the literature",
    "two drive mechanisms for mtms are proposed : one is the time - dependent thermal force experienced by electrons which results in a parallel current that produces magnetic field perturbations .",
    "if these perturbations then tip the field lines in the direction of an equilibrium electron temperature gradient the thermal force will increase and therefore the instability arises @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is due to a current carried by nearly trapped electrons in a boundary layer close to the trapped - passing boundary @xcite .",
    "both of these mechanisms require finite electron temperature gradient and collisions .",
    "however , mtms have been observed to arise under conditions which are not well - described by the above mechanisms @xcite .",
    "thus , a complete picture of mtm excitation is not available at present .    in the following",
    "we summarize the previous findings reported in refs .",
    "linear simulations for mast @xcite , nstx@xcite , and asdex - ug @xcite plasmas reported that mtms can be the dominant instabilities in the region @xmath6 with the maximum growth rate at mode numbers @xmath7 between @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the ion sound larmor radius .",
    "the electron temperature gradient is found to be the drive of the instability and a non - monotonic dependence of the growth rate on the electron - ion collisionality @xmath10 is observed .",
    "the peak of the growth rate coincides with the experimental value of @xmath10 for various considered radial positions .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of the mtm growth rate on collisionality is due to the fact that , on one hand both of the driving mechanisms mentioned above require finite collisionality , and therefore stability can be expected as @xmath10 reduces , but on the other hand , in a strongly collisional regime the strong rate of scattering of the electrons between the field lines prevents the formation of a current layer , hence mtms are stabilized @xcite .    it has also been shown that by increasing the effective ion charge @xmath11 , mtms are destabilized through the @xmath11-dependence of the electron - ion collision frequency , see ref .  @xcite . as mtms are electromagnetic in nature a finite @xmath0 is needed for their destabilization . for the studied discharge in ref .  @xcite it is found that the @xmath0 threshold is well below the experimentally relevant @xmath0 value and the growth rate increases moderately with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "non - linear simulations confirmed the role of the electron temperature gradient as the drive of the mtm instability in spherical ( nstx ) @xcite as well as standard tokamaks ( asdex - ug ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the chirikov criterion @xcite for overlapping of the magnetic islands leads to an up - shift of the electron temperature gradient threshold @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the onset of the mtms and its parametric dependence through local linear gyrokinetic simulations with the gyrocode  @xcite , in a spherical tokamak : nstx , and two conventional tokamaks : asdex - ug and jet . for the nstx case we use the plasma parameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the asdex - ug case we use the plasma parameters found in ref .  @xcite . in the present work we re - examine these discharges with an emphasis on the parametric dependences of the mtm onset . in view of the new iter - like wall experiments on jet , in the presented analysis",

    "we have investigated the onset and parametric dependences of the mtm instability in the core ( @xmath65 ) of a spherical ( nstx ) , and two conventional tokamaks ( asdex - ug , jet ) .",
    "the quasilinear transport is computed using the gyrokinetic code gyroin the flux - tube ( local ) limit . in confirmation with previous studies",
    ", we found that for the experimentally relevant plasma parameters the mtms are linearly the dominant instability in nstx and asdex - ug . under typical jet baseline parameters considered here the mtms",
    "are also found as the dominant linear instability . in nstx and jet",
    "the maximum of the mtm linear growth rate is located at higher mode numbers than that for asdex - ug .",
    "therefore , the previously discussed idea that the higher mode number mtms are the characteristics of the spherical tokamaks , while lower mode number mtms are the characteristics of the conventional tokamaks is not supported by our results .",
    "parametric scaling of the mtm instability in the core of these plasmas , revealed that a finite level of @xmath10 and @xmath0 are needed in order for mtms to become unstable , and when unstable , they can remain the dominant instability over a wide range in @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "the linear mtm growth rate seems to be only weakly dependent on @xmath0 , and exhibits a weak but non - monotonic dependence on collisionality , @xmath10 . by neglecting the collisionality or @xmath0 effects ,",
    "the itg / tem modes appear as the most unstable modes in all three studied machines .",
    "a strong dependence for the growth rate of mtms on electron temperature gradient is found in nstx , while for asdex - ug and jet the mtm growth rate is found to be less sensitive to this parameter .",
    "the mtm growth rate significantly increases as @xmath58 increases in nstx , but in asdex - ug and jet a weak and non - monotonic dependence on @xmath58 is found .",
    "these results indicate that while @xmath58 is a fundamental drive for the mtms in these plasmas , it can contribute to the stabilization of the mode as well ; this non - trivial behavior is more pronounced in the asdex - ug and jet plasmas .",
    "similar trends are observed in all three machines when scanning for the electron density gradient , where the mtms linear growth rates show again a non - monotonic dependences on @xmath59 parameter with peaks located in the negative @xmath59 region corresponding to slightly hollow electron density profiles .",
    "we have investigated the impact of a finite @xmath24 on the onset and characteristics of mtm instability in various parametric scans , and we have observed that the stabilization of @xmath24 parameter on the mtm mode itself is not significant in all machines . however , its impact on the itg / tem unstable modes can result in a strong suppression of these modes allowing for the mtm to remain the dominant instability for a wider range in considered parameters , i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the non - monotonic and weaker dependence of the mtm on the electron temperature / density gradient however , can not be explained by @xmath24 effects .    in the studied cases",
    "the mtm drives mostly electron heat transport through @xmath42 fluctuations , while other transport channels and contributions from @xmath41 and @xmath43 are significantly smaller . for the ion heat flux and particle fluxes , the transport driven by mtms",
    "are negligible , however , if ballooning modes like itg / tem / kbm are also present , even as sub - dominant modes , these fluxes are mainly driven by these modes and therefore the overall ion heat and particle transport may not be negligible . however , these findings are based on linear analysis and further non - linear studies are needed for their confirmation .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that the cases which we have considered have been chosen because they were unstable to mtms .",
    "however , particularly large aspect ratio tokamaks , being unstable to mtms should not be considered a generic property .",
