    "the study of multi - strange baryons in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions was first motivated by the prediction of an enhancement of strange @xmath3 pair production due to the formation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) compared to that found from a hadron gas state @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is thought to be more pronounced for multi - strange baryons and anti - baryons since their production is strongly suppressed in hadronic interactions due to their high mass thresholds @xcite .",
    "also , by comparing the multi - strange baryon yields and ratios to other particles with those predicted from particle production models , one can test whether the system has reached chemical equilibrium or not .",
    "the study of transverse momentum spectra will allow us to test the thermal equilibration of the system .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) allows for the study of nuclear matter in extreme conditions such as in the case of the theoretical qgp .",
    "we present here preliminary measurements of multi - strange baryon production at mid - rapidity as a function of the collision centrality in @xmath2 gev au+au collisions from the star experiment .",
    "the data presented here were taken with the star detector during the year 2000 au+au at @xmath2 gev run .",
    "the experimental setup for this period consisted mainly of a large cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) used for charged particle tracking and identification .",
    "a central trigger barrel ( ctb ) and two zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) were used for triggering .",
    "more details of the experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data were divided into three centrality classes corresponding to @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the total hadronic cross section as described in @xcite .",
    "the multi - strange @xmath0 particles were reconstructed via their decay topologies , @xmath7 followed by @xmath8 with a branching ratio of @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 particles was handled by first reconstructing @xmath11 candidates as described in @xcite .",
    "these @xmath11 candidates were then extrapolated backwards and combined with negatively charged tracks to determine @xmath0 candidates , and similarly for the charge conjugate @xmath1 decay . particle identification from energy loss of charged tracks in the tpc as well as",
    "simple geometric and kinematic cuts were applied at both steps to reduce the large combinatorial background inherent to such a reconstruction process . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 the raw yields",
    "were extracted from the invariant mass distribution by counting the entries within @xmath12  mev / c@xmath13 about the expected mass and then subtracting the background .",
    "the background under the peak was estimated by sampling two regions on either side .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of @xmath0(@xmath1 ) candidates was then histogramed in transverse mass @xmath14 bins and the signal extracted in each bin as described above .",
    "each @xmath15 bin was then corrected for detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency by the monte carlo technique where simulated @xmath0 particles were embedded into real events .",
    "the data cover @xmath16 , simulations showed that the acceptance and efficiency for @xmath17 is constant , in @xmath18 , over this range .",
    "each of the obtained preliminary @xmath15 spectra for @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the three centrality classes used in this analysis was then fit to an exponential function ( @xmath19 ) to determine simultaneously the inverse slope , @xmath20 , and the rapidity density , @xmath21 , integrated over all @xmath15 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ fitparxi ] .",
    "we observe that the slope parameter is , within error bars , the same for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and is not strongly dependent on centrality .",
    "also the @xmath21 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 is found to increase linearly with @xmath22 .",
    "thus , no noticeable change of the production mechanism for @xmath17 baryons is observed in the covered centrality region .",
    "systematic errors are estimated to be @xmath23 .",
    "the feeddown from weak decay of @xmath24(@xmath25 ) on @xmath0(@xmath1 ) is estimated to be less than @xmath26 and thus it has been neglected for this analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 particle yields in the measured @xmath15 region correspond to @xmath27 of the total yield .",
    ".mid - rapidity fit parameters from exponential fit to @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath15 spectra . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure  [ invslopevsmass ] shows the mid - rapidity inverse slope parameters as a function of particle mass , for central pb+pb collisions at @xmath2817.2 gev @xcite and preliminary results from au+au collisions at @xmath28130 gev @xcite .",
    "note that both , statistical errors and systematic errors ( horizontal lines ) are reported on star points , while sps points only include statistical errors .",
    "we observe the following : the inverse slope parameters are higher in rhic collisions than in sps collisions and the strange baryons seem to deviate from the collective flow pattern driven by lighter particles at both energies .",
    "the relatively low inverse slope parameter found for the @xmath17 baryons may be due to the functional form and the @xmath15 range used for the fit or it could indicate , as proposed in @xcite , that they freeze - out earlier during the system s evolution .      figure  [ nonidenratios ] shows the mid - rapidity ratios ( a ) @xmath29 and ( b ) @xmath30 from heavy ion collisions at sps @xcite , plus preliminary rhic results .",
    "the @xmath31 ratio increases with beam energy indicating a higher exitation energy from the collision reached at rhic energies compared to sps energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath32 ratio remains constant from sps to rhic energies due to the competing effect of the droping net - baryon density . also from sps to rhic energies ,",
    "the @xmath33 ratio increases due again to the drop of the net - baryon density which causes a smaller fractional rise on @xmath11 than on @xmath0 , while the @xmath34 is constant .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath34 suggests a saturation of the strangeness production from sps to rhic .",
    "note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 ratios have been corrected for feeddown from weak decays of @xmath17 on @xmath35 . for sps values",
    "the quoted @xcite upper limits of @xmath36 for @xmath11 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 were used .",
    "ratios and ( b ) @xmath39 ratios as a function of beam energy .",
    "systematic errors to star points are shown in gray.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    particle ratios between dissimilar species can be used to test particle production models . using preliminary star data",
    "we have obtained @xmath40 .",
    "alcor , a quark coalescence model , overestimates the @xmath41 ratio by almost a factor of two @xcite . a statistical model assuming local chemical equilibrium and strangeness neutrality @xcite is , within systematic errors , in agreement with the experimental value of @xmath41 ratio .",
    "finally the authors of @xcite need to assume chemical non - equilibrium in their qgp model to better address the @xmath33 ratio .",
    "in summary , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 invariant yields at mid rapidity increase linearly with the number of produced negative hadrons . the production of strangeness per produced hadron seems to saturate from sps to rhic energies , which is consistent with the system being in chemical equilibrium .",
    "the extracted inverse slope parameters are the same for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 and are not strongly dependent with centrality . for central collisions",
    "this inverse slope parameter is higher than that from collisions at the sps energy and shows a deviation from a collective flow pattern that may indicate an earlier freeze - out of multi - strange baryons .",
