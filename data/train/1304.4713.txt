    "the attractive feature of the fl model makes it suitable for the study of the medium modifications of baryon properties .",

    "this treatment is very like the method used in the qmf model  @xcite , and it is similar to adjusting the parameter @xmath131 by hyperon masses in an earlier version of the qmc model  @xcite . using this simple method , we obtain the potential depth of a @xmath2 in saturated nuclear matter to be around @xmath132 mev with the parameter set b , which is very close to the value of @xmath0 case .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 hypernuclei in the present model could be bound by an amount similar to @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "such a result is not consistent with the repulsive @xmath2 potential suggested by recent experimental studies .",
    "hopefully , the model can be improved by including the quark - quark hyperfine interactions as done in the qmc model  @xcite . for @xmath4 hypernuclei , we obtain the potential depth of a @xmath4 in saturated nuclear matter to be around @xmath133 mev with the parameter set b , and consequently @xmath4 hypernuclei are weakly bound in the present model .",
    "we note that the parameter set a yields qualitatively similar results for @xmath2 and @xmath4 hypernuclei .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a model for the description of @xmath0 hypernuclei and for investigating the medium modifications of baryon properties .",
    "we have used the fl model to describe the nucleon and @xmath0 in nuclear matter and hypernuclei . in the fl model ,",
    "the baryon is described as a bound state of three quarks in a nontopological soliton formed by a scalar composite gluon field .",
    "the baryons interact through the self - consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons generated by the nuclear environment .",
    "the mesons , which are treated as classical fields in the spirit of the qmc model , couple directly to the quarks inside the baryons .",
    "the quark degrees of freedom are explicitly considered in the model ; therefore , it enables us to investigate the medium modifications of baryons in a nuclear many - body system and provide a reasonable description of the system in a consistent manner .",
    "we have presented the calculated results of @xmath0 hypernuclei and the medium modifications of baryon properties with two sets of parameters , which correspond to the two limiting cases in the parameter space of the fl model .",
    "the parameters in the fl model are constrained by reproducing free baryon properties , while the quark - meson couplings are determined by fitting saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , no more adjustable parameters exist when we calculate the properties of @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "it has been found that the resulting @xmath0 single - particle energies with the parameter set b are very close to the experimental values , while those with set a are slightly underestimated .",
    "we have found that the properties of the nucleon and @xmath0 are significantly modified in nuclear medium . at normal nuclear matter density , the nucleon radius increases by about @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) with the parameter set b ( a ) , while the @xmath0 radius increases by about @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) . in the @xmath0 hypernucleus ,",
    "both nucleon and @xmath0 radii increase significantly from the surface to the interior .",
    "it is gratifying to note that the present model is able to provide a reasonable description of @xmath0 hypernuclei without adjusting parameters , and at the same time it predicts a significant increase of the baryon radius in nuclear medium .",
    "it is important to point out the limitations of the present model and possible directions for further improvements .",
    "we have examined its applicability to @xmath2 and @xmath4 hypernuclei . using a simple method for including spin - dependent interactions",
    ", we found that @xmath2 hypernuclei are bound by an amount similar to @xmath0 hypernuclei and @xmath4 hypernuclei are weakly bound in the present model .",
    "this is not consistent with the repulsive @xmath2 potential suggested by recent experimental studies .",
    "according to recent developments of the qmc model , the quark - quark hyperfine interaction due to the gluon exchange plays an important role in explaining why @xmath0 hypernuclei are bound whereas @xmath2 hypernuclei are not .",
    "in further work , we plan to include the quark - quark hyperfine interaction in the fl model and explore its medium modification .",
    "it is very interesting to investigate and compare the influence of the hyperfine interaction on properties of in - medium baryons and hypernuclei .",
