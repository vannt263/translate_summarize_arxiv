    "condensation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature . it may take place in equilibrium , off - equilibrium , in real space or in momentum space . starting from the most familiar condensation of supersaturated vapour",
    ", there is a great abundance of examples which includes , among others , the bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite and the related transition in mean - field systems , like the spherical  @xcite or the large-@xmath0 model  @xcite .",
    "more recently there has been much interest in condensation transitions arising out of equilibrium , both in classical  @xcite and quantum systems  @xcite . in the non equilibrium context",
    "the phenomenology of condensation turns out to be very rich with a variety of manifestations in fields as diverse as economics , information theory , traffic models , granular materials , networks and mass transport  @xcite .",
    "much progress in the understanding of the basic features common to most of these different instances of condensation has been achieved through the study of driven diffusive systems and , in particular , of the zero - range process or variants of it  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus on a yet another manifestation of condensation , which is somewhat conceptually different . in the usual contexts mentioned above",
    ", condensation is a phenomenon observed in the average behavior of the system .",
    "instead , we shall be concerned with condensation occurring in the _ fluctuations _ , namely with condensation as a _ rare _ event  @xcite .",
    "the conceptual and substantial difference is that condensation of fluctuations may occurr even in systems which can not sustain condensation on average , such as non interacting systems . in order to emphasize this point",
    ", we shall work with the gaussian model , which is the paradigmatical non interacting system in the theory of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "although the average properties of this system are well known to be trivial , in and out of equilibrium , we shall find that fluctuations of extensive quantities may condense .",
    "most of the work quoted above on condensation , both on average and in the fluctuations , has been carried out in the context of non equilibrium steady states , obtained by driving an externally generated current into the system . here , instead , we shall carry further the program initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite of exploring fluctuations in the largely unknown area of the processes wihout time translation invariance  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we shall consider the ralaxation following the istantaneous quench from an initial temperature @xmath1 to a lower temperature @xmath2 .",
    "with such a choice , we can overview the entire evolution from the equilibrium behavior before the quench to the off equilibrium relaxation after the quench .",
    "we shall see that , depending on the nature of the observable , fluctuations may condense either in and out of equilibrium , or just as an out of equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "we shall analyse in detail the mechanism of condensation and we shall derive phase diagrams , extending into the time direction .",
    "these diagrams show that during relaxation condensation is enhanced by the dynamics , if occurring also in equilibrium , or dynamically generated if absent in equilibrium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ii ] we set up the ensemble theory apparatus needed in the rest of the paper .",
    "the gaussian model is introduced in section  [ iii ] .",
    "section  [ iv ] is the central section of the paper , where the notions of condensation on average and condensation of the fluctuations are discussed in general .",
    "the example of a macrovariable condensing both in equilibrium and off equilibrium is treated in section  [ v ] , while the example of condensation as an out - of - equilibrium phenomenon is discussed in section  [ vi ] .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section  [ vii ] .",
    "the apparently puzzling feature of condensation appearing in the fluctuations of a non interacting system finds explanation in the framework of large deviation theory  @xcite , through the mapping of rare fluctuations in the given system ( in our case the gaussian model ) into typical events in a new system , obtained by the application of an appropriate bias . the key point , as we shall see ,",
    "is that the bias produces an effective interaction , which is responsible of the condensation on average in the biased system .",
    "the basic idea amounts to an extension of ensemble theory beyond the realm of equilibrium statistical mechanics , according to a scheme which has been recently used in a variety of different contexts , classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite .    in order to give a general presentation of the method ,",
    "let us consider a generic probability distribution @xmath3 , referred to as the _ prior _ and describing the state of a system of volume v , with microstates consisting of sets of degrees of freedom @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is a generic label , and control parameters @xmath6",
    ". in this paper @xmath5 is the position vector @xmath7 in real space or the wave vector @xmath8 in fourier space , and @xmath6 stands for temperature @xmath9 in equilibrium or for time @xmath10 off equilibrium .",
    "the probability of a fluctuation @xmath11 of a random variable @xmath12 is given by p(m , j ) = _ d p(,j)(m - m ( ) ) [ gen.3 ] where @xmath13 is the phase space . introducing the integral representation of the @xmath14 function @xmath15",
    "this becomes p(m , j ) = _ - i^+ i e^-zm k_m(z , j ) [ gen.5 ] where k_m(z , j ) = e^zm ( ) [ gen.6 ] is the moment generating function of @xmath16 and the brackets @xmath17 denote the average in the prior ensemble . if the system is extended and @xmath12 is an extensive macrovariable , for large volume eq .",
    "( [ gen.5 ] ) can be rewritten as p(m , j , v ) = _ - i^+ i e^-v[zm + _ m(z , j ) ] [ gen.6 ] where @xmath18 is the density @xmath19 and -_m(z , j ) = k_m(z , j , v ) [ gen.7bis ] is the volume independent scaled cumulant generating function .",
    "carrying out the integration by the saddle point method , the large deviation principle is obtained p(m , j , v ) ~e^-vi_m(m , j ) [ gen.8 ] with the rate function i_m(m , j ) = z^*m + _",
    "m(z^*,j ) [ gen.9 ] and where @xmath20 is the solution , supposedly unique , of the saddle point equation _ m(z , j ) = -m .",
    "[ gen.9bis ]    from the above algebra follows the basic result of large deviation theory  @xcite that @xmath21 and @xmath22 form a pair of legendre transforms .",
    "therefore , regarding the latter quantity as the `` free energy '' of the new ensemble p(,z , j , v ) = p(,j , v ) e^zm ( ) [ du.2 ] obtained by imposing the exponential bias on the prior , the rate function remains identified with the `` thermodynamic potential '' associated to yet another ensemble p(,m , j , v ) = p(,j , v)(m - m ( ) ) [ gen.2 ] in which the bias is implemented rigidly through the phase space restriction @xmath23 . to make contact with familiar ground , if the prior was the uniform ensemble @xmath24 and @xmath16 the energy of the system , then @xmath25 and @xmath26 would be , respectively , the usual canonical ensemble at the inverse temperature @xmath27 and the microcanonical ensemble with energy @xmath28 .",
    "we stress that the above chain of relations holds in general , without limitations to equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath21 plays two distinct roles  @xcite : on the one hand it acts as the rate function regulating the occurrence of rare events in the prior ensemble and on the other hand it is the thermodynamic potential accounting for the average properties in the constrained ensemble @xmath29 . in particular , if the extra correlations due to the bias are responsible of singularities in the free energy , amenable to a phase transition , the same singularities arise in the unbiased fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the same phenomenon , in principle , could be observed following different experimental protocols , either by leaving the system unbiased and monitoring fluctuations or , alternatively , by arranging the appropriate bias aimed to render typical the effect of interest .",
    "in order to produce a concrete and simple realization of the above ideas , let us consider the gaussian model , which describes a system of volume @xmath30 , with a scalar order parameter field @xmath31 and the bilinear energy functional [ ] = _ v d x [ ( ) ^2 + r ^2 ( x ) ] [ gmd.1 ] where @xmath32 is a non negative mass .",

    "[ lg.2 ] due to linearity , the problem can be diagonalized by fourier transformation .",

    "let us first consider equilibrium , in the time region @xmath114 preceding the quench . here , the critical line is horizontal and corresponds to the critical threshold @xmath115 of the spherical model at the temperature @xmath1  @xcite . then , according to the dual point of view expounded above , the two alternative readings of the equilibrium transition are that condensation can be observed either as the usual transition of the spherical model or as a rare event in the gaussian model , where the sample variance is free to fluctuate .",
    "consider , next , the relaxation regime after the quench , for @xmath116 . as it is evident form fig .",
    "[ ph_diag_s ] , there are two time regimes separated by the minimum of the critical line , about the characteristic time @xmath117 , which is the relaxation time of the slowest mode . in the first regime @xmath118",

    "hence , condensation of the fluctuations is enhanced by the off equilibrium dynamics .",
    "ii ) the nonmonotonicity of the critical line is a remarkable dynamical feature , leading to a re - entrance phenomenon .",
    "namely , when the transition is driven by @xmath10 , and @xmath109 is kept fixed to a value in between @xmath124 and @xmath115 , a fluctuation of this size at first is normal and then condenses , while for @xmath109 in between the minimum of the critical line and @xmath124 , the fluctuation undergoes a second and reverse transition becoming normal again at late times .",

    "[ criten.1 ] the corresponding phase diagram , in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ ph_diag_s ] , is qualitatively different from the one in the top panel for the absence of the phase transition in equilibrium .",

    "consequently , @xmath132 drops down from infinity to a minimum around @xmath123 and , then , rises again toward infinity as the system reaches the final equilibrium state .",
    "the nonmonotonic shape of the critical line implies , also in this case , re - entrance of the @xmath10-driven transition for all fluctuations above the minimum of the critical line .",
    "in summary , we have analysed the behavior of fluctuations of macrovariables in the gaussian model , both in equilibrium and in the off equilibrium relaxation following a sudden temperature quench . for a certain class of bilinear variables",
    "there is condensation in the behavior of large deviations , in the sense that the @xmath85 mode contributes a macroscopic amount to the fluctuations .",

    "<S> condensation of fluctuations is an interesting phenomenon conceptually distinct from condensation on average . </S>",
    "<S> one stricking feature is that , contrary to what happens on average , condensation of fluctuations may occurr even in the absence of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation emerges from the duality between large deviation events in the given system and typical events in a new and appropriately biased system . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising phenomenon is investigated in the context of the gaussian model , chosen as paradigmatical non interacting system , before and after an istantaneous temperature quench . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the bias induces a mean - field - like effective interaction responsible of the condensation on average . </S>",
    "<S> phase diagrams , covering both the equilibrium and the off - equilibrium regimes , are derived for observables representative of generic behaviors . </S>"
