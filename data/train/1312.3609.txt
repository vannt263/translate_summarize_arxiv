    ", huge amounts of energy can be liberated .",
    "assuming that the energy released during mass accretion onto a bh is @xmath5 , to build a bh with mass @xmath6m@xmath7 would correspond to @xmath8erg .",
    "this total accretion energy is two orders of magnitude higher than the binding energy of the host galaxy spheroid ( @xmath9m@xmath7 ; @xmath10erg ) and can be comparable to , or higher than , the thermal energy of the gas in the dark matter halo ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bower et  al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "if even a small fraction of the accretion energy can couple to the gas over @xmath40.11000kpc , growing bhs have the potential to regulate their own growth and impact upon the gas in their host galaxies and that in the larger scale environment . indeed , to successfully reproduce",
    "many of the fundamental properties of galaxies , icm and the igm models of galaxy formation have found it necessary for agn to inject some of this energy into the surrounding gas .",
    "i discuss some examples of this below .",
    "one of the most famous theoretical results on the impact of agn comes from semi - analytical models , which are unable to reproduce the cut - off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function without agn injecting energy into the halo gas ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "low accretion rate agn located in the quasi - hydrostatic halos of massive galaxies ( i.e. , halo masses @xmath11m@xmath7 for local galaxies ) efficiently suppress the cooling of hot gas through the so - called `` maintenance - mode '' or `` radio - mode '' , resulting in the regulation of future star formation ( sf ) and bh growth in the host galaxy .",
    "this method of feedback has also been used to explain other observables such as the lack of cold gas in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "the relationship between the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath12 ) and x - ray temperature ( @xmath13 ) of the icm within groups and clusters is another key observable for models to reproduce .",

    "in contrast , a more rapid / catastrophic form of interaction between agn and their host galaxies ( sometimes named the `` quasar mode '' ) is proposed during high accretion states ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * silk & rees 1998 ) ) . to reproduce many fundamental observables of massive galaxies and bhs ,",

    "subsequent to the surveys carried out by the _ herschel",
