    "however , we checked using the example of the av18 and urbana ix 3nf combination that the conclusions remain unchanged when instead of the chiral forces so - called high precision realistic forces are used .    since cib effects are driven by the difference between np and nn t - matrices we display in figs .

    "the nn interaction of column  4 was combined with 3nf ( no cib , @xmath11 , @xmath83 ) . in column  6 a proper treatment of the cib in the @xmath3 partial wave",
    "was performed by taking in that partial wave both np and nn interactions and keeping in addition to the total isospin @xmath48 also @xmath0 . in all other @xmath50 states",
    "the effective t - matrix @xmath83 was used and only states with @xmath48 were kept .",
    "no 3nf was allowed ( @xmath3 cib , @xmath81 ) .",

    "the proper treatment of cib in all states with @xmath50 , when both np and nn interactions were used and both @xmath48 and @xmath0 states were kept , are shown in column  8 and 9 for the cases when nn interactions were used alone ( cib , @xmath81 ) and combined with 3nf ( cib , @xmath11 ) , respectively .    from tables",
    "[ table1 ] ,  [ table2 ] ,  and  [ table3 ] it is clear that it is sufficient to use the effective t - matrix @xmath83 and to neglect @xmath0 states completely to account exactly for cib effects in all three total cross sections .",
    "that is true in both cases , when the 3nf is present or absent . in the case when the 3nf is not included , the total cross sections for the nd interaction , for elastic scattering , and for breakup , depend slightly on the @xmath3 t - matrix used in the calculations .",
    "changing it from @xmath41 to @xmath40 leads to differences of the cross section values up to @xmath84 ( columns  2 and 4 ) . using in the @xmath3 channel the effective t - matrix @xmath82 accounts for all cib effects exactly , without the necessity to introduce the total isospin @xmath0 components in any of the @xmath50 partial wave states .",
    "namely , the exact treatment of cib by using in all @xmath50 states the @xmath41 and @xmath40 t - matrices and both @xmath48 and @xmath0 partial wave states ( column  8) gives the same value for all three total cross sections . also restricting the exact treatment of cib to the @xmath3 state only ( column  6 )",
    "provides the same values for the total cross sections .",
    "it shows that contribution of @xmath0 states , as far as the total cross sections are concerned , can be neglected and all cib effects properly taken into account by restricting to the total isospin @xmath48 states only and using in all @xmath50 channels the effective t - matrix generated according to the @xmath4 rule .",
    "the same is true when 3nf is included . in this case , in all three total cross sections , clear effects increasing with energy are seen . but",
    "again , all three treatments of cib yield the same numbers ( columns 5 , 7 , and 9 ) . since in the cases when @xmath0 states were included ( columns 7 and 9 ) also the corresponding @xmath0 matrix elements of a 3nf were used , we conclude that their influence on the total cross sections is negligible .      in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we display results for the nd elastic scattering angular distributions obtained using different assumptions about the underlying dynamics and treatment of cib . as for the total cross sections , in case when the 3nf is inactive , the three treatments of the cib , namely using @xmath83 and no @xmath0 states , @xmath0 in the @xmath3 state with the @xmath41 and @xmath40 t - matrices in that state , and @xmath0 in all @xmath50 states with the corresponding np and nn t - matrices , provide the same elastic scattering cross sections ( dashed ( cyan ) , dashed - dotted ( magenta ) , and dotted ( maroon ) lines , respectively ) .",

    "we checked that also for all nd elastic scattering spin observables , encompassing the neutron ( vector ) and deuteron ( vector and tensor ) analyzing powers , the spin correlation as well as spin transfer coefficients , the above three approaches lead to the same results .",
    "thus again the contribution of all @xmath0 states can be neglected and cib in elastic nd scattering treated exactly by restricting only to @xmath48 states and using in all @xmath50 states the @xmath4 rule to generate from @xmath41 and @xmath40 the effective @xmath83 t - matrix .",
    "restricting to @xmath41 or @xmath40 t - matrices in the @xmath3 channel and neglecting all @xmath0 states changes the elastic scattering cross sections and spin observables by up to @xmath85 ( see the solid ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) lines , respectively , in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .    adding the 3nf changes the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "the 3nf effects grow with the projectile energy and are especially large in the region of intermediate and backward angles .",
    "but again the three approaches to cib provide the same cross sections and spin observables ( they are displayed for cross sections in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] by overlapping lines : dotted ( black ) , dashed - double - dotted ( green ) , and dotted - double - dashed ( magenta ) ) . that again supports the conclusion that @xmath0 states can be neglected together with the @xmath0 3nf matrix elements for all nd elastic scattering observables .      in the final breakup state of three free nucleons",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath0 total isospin components are allowed .",
    "thus one would expect that here the influence of the @xmath0 components will be better visible than in elastic scattering .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig8 ] that this indeed is the case for the example of three kinematically complete breakup configurations : final - state - interaction ( fsi ) , quasi - free - scattering ( qfs ) , and symmetrical - space - star ( sst ) .    in the fsi configuration under the exact fsi condition ,",
    "the two outgoing nucleons have equal momenta .",
    "their strong interaction in the @xmath3 state leads to a characteristic cross section maximum occurring at the exact fsi condition , the magnitude of which is sensitive to the @xmath3 scattering length .",
    "since largest cib effects are seen in the difference between np and nn ( pp ) @xmath3 scattering lengths , the region of the fsi peak should reveal largest cib effects . that is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a for the nn and in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b for the np fsi configuration , where the solid ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) lines display fsi cross sections obtained with the @xmath3 np and nn t - matrices , respectively , using in all other @xmath50 states the effective t - matrix @xmath83 .",
    "only @xmath48 states were used and the 3nf was omitted . using also in the @xmath3 state the effective t - matrix leads to the dashed ( cyan ) line , which changes to the dotted ( black ) line when ,",
    "keeping the rest unchanged , the 3nf is also included .",
    "most interesting is the effect of treating the cib exactly in the state @xmath3 by including the @xmath0 component and using both @xmath41 and @xmath40 t - matrices : dashed - dotted ( magenta ) and dashed - double - dotted ( green ) lines in case when 3nf is omitted and included , respectively .",
    "as expected , the inclusion of the isospin @xmath0 in the @xmath3 state brings the predictions , in the case when 3nf is omitted , close to the nn prediction ( dashed ( red ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) for the nn fsi , and close to the np prediction ( solid ( blue ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) for the np fsi .",
    "however , a significant difference exists between that result and the pure nn or np ones as well as when compared to results obtained with the effective t - matrix @xmath83 ( dashed ( cyan ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a and [ fig5]b ) .",
    "this shows that the proper treatment of cib in the fsi configurations of the nd breakup requires the inclusion of the total isospin @xmath0 component and using both @xmath41 and @xmath40 t - matrices in the @xmath3 state .",
    "this is also sufficient for the exact treatment of cib as shown by the results of the full cib treatment , where in all @xmath50 partial waves also isospin @xmath0 states are taken into account and corresponding @xmath41 and @xmath40 t - matrices are used , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5]a and [ fig5]b by the dotted ( maroon ) line for the nn interaction acting alone and dotted - double - dashed ( magenta ) line when combined with the 3nf , respectively .",
    "these lines overlap with the lines corresponding to the case when @xmath0 is included for the state @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0 component in the @xmath3 state is important and provides fsi cross sections which are different from the results obtained with particular nn @xmath3 interactions only ( np for np fsi and nn for nn fsi ) .",
    "it proves the importance of including @xmath0 in the @xmath3 state and shows that both np and nn interactions have to be employed when the fsi peaks are analyzed to extract the value of the corresponding scattering length .    in order to see how the magnitude of the effects induced by the @xmath0 @xmath3 component depends on the particular fsi configuration , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the cross section in the maximum of the fsi peak as a function of the laboratory production angle of the final - state interacting pair .",
    "again it is clearly seen that restricting to @xmath83 only and neglecting @xmath0 components is insufficient to include all cib effects .",
    "inclusion of @xmath0 component only in the @xmath3 state is , however , sufficient to fully account for the cib effects .",
    "the importance of that component depends on the production angle . at the angles in the region around @xmath86 the contribution of that component is tiny but",
    "becomes significant at smaller and larger production angles .",
    "for the qfs and sst configurations the picture is similar . again in order to fully account for the cib effects it is necessary and sufficient to include the total isospin @xmath0 component in the @xmath3 state .",
    "we exemplify this in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the nn qfs and in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the sst configurations .",
    "again there is an angle around which the contribution of that component is minimized . for the nn qfs it occurs around @xmath87 and for the sst around @xmath88 .",
    "we investigated the importance of the scattering amplitude components with the total 3n isospin @xmath0 in two 3n reactions .",
    "the inclusion of these components is required to account for cib effects of the nn interaction .",
    "the difference between np and nn ( pp ) forces leads to a situation in which also the matrix elements of the 3nf between @xmath0 states contribute to the considered 3n reactions .",
    "the modern nn interactions , which describe existing pp and np data with high precision , provide pp and np t - matrices which differ up to @xmath89 .",
    "such a magnitude of cib requires that the isospin @xmath0 components are included in the calculation of the breakup reaction , especially for the regions of the breakup phase - space close to the fsi condition .",
    "however , in order to account for all cib effects it is sufficient to restrict the inclusion of @xmath0 to the @xmath3 partial wave state only instead of doing it in all @xmath50 states . for elastic scattering we found that the @xmath0 components can be neglected completely and all cib effects",
    "are accounted for by restricting oneself to total 3n isospin @xmath48 partial waves only and using the effective t - matrix generated with the @xmath90 rule @xmath82 .",
    "these results allow one to reduce significantly the number of partial waves in time - consuming 3n calculations .",

    "<S> the contribution of this amplitude originates from charge - independence breaking of the nucleon - nucleon potential and is driven by the difference between neutron - neutron ( proton - proton ) and neutron - proton forces . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the isospin @xmath0 component is important for the breakup reaction and the proper treatment of charge - independence breaking in this case requires the inclusion of the @xmath3 state with isospin @xmath0 . for neutron - deuteron elastic scattering </S>",
