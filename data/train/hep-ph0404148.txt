    "has quickly become a real theoretical challenge . in this respect ,",
    "perturbative qcd mechanisms [ 5 ] , with different @xmath9 vertex function [ 5 , 6 ] , have been considered as main candidates for significantly increasing the @xmath0 value . on the other hand , while searching for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , supersymmetry has been employed in processes like @xmath10 [ 7 ] , @xmath11 [ 8 ] , @xmath12 [ 9 , 10 ] , @xmath13 [ 11 ] , and deviations from the sm predictions for the values of branching ratios and @xmath14 asymmetries have been the main targets .",

    "we give a detailed calculation of the gluonic transition form factor which plays an important role in the evaluation of this contribution .",
    "although it has been concluded that this mechanism could provide large @xmath1 values [ 13 ] , we show that the presence of combined singularities in the amplitude convolution is a source of large uncertainties . in section 4",
