    "the term _ duality _ is pervasive in physics , mathematics and philosophy . in general , a duality connects and contrasts two aspects or realizations of a given entity . in this article",
    "we will be concerned only with dualities in physics .",
    "these are specific mathematical transformations that we will uncover as we proceed connecting seemingly unrelated _ physical phenomena_.    over time",
    ", dualities have appeared in various guises in nearly all disciplines of physics @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) duality of maxwell s equations in the absence of sources , noticed by heaviside in 1884 , is probably the oldest well - known duality in modern physics .",
    "later , the wave - particle duality of quantum mechanics @xcite became a fundamental tenet of the modern physical description of reality .",
    "this fourier transform - based duality has since appeared in numerous arenas , including in recent years various branches of quantum statistical mechanics and field theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and it is likely to continue to play an ever increasing role .",
    "kramers and wannier introduced dualities in statistical mechanics in their foundational 1941 paper @xcite .",
    "these authors discovered an elegant relation between the two - dimensional classical ising model on a square lattice _ at high temperature _ , and the same model _ at low temperature _",
    "( hence the origin of the name  self - duality \" in this case ) , and used it to determine that model s _ exact critical temperature _ some years before onsager @xcite published its exact solution . this first _ quantitative _ success",
    "was followed by other similar ones , and so dualities became a standard tool in statistical mechanics since they could also provide _ qualitative _ insight .",
    "the spectacular cross - fertilization between statistical mechanics and quantum field theory ( qft ) of the 1970 s brought dualities to the attention of high energy theorists , and soon it became apparent that dualities in qft combined features of the em and statistical mechanics dualities while retaining their distinct capability to produce weakly - coupled representations of strongly - coupled problems .",
    "dualities can provide reliable qualitative or even exact quantitative information about systems that need not be exactly solvable , partly because they can put constraints on the phase boundaries and the exact location of some critical or multi - critical points . thus ( self-)dualities have been essential for investigating the phase diagrams of numerous models in statistical mechanics and field theory @xcite .",
    "this aspect encompasses some of the most spectacular applications of dualities , and constitutes the legacy of kramers and wannier .",
    "however , dualities can become even more potent when fused with other tools , such as perturbation theory .",
    "a case in point is the ads - cft correspondence , a topic that remains the focus of intense research efforts . since its original formulation in high energy physics @xcite ,",
    "this _ conjecture of a duality _ between a weakly - coupled five - dimensional gravity theory ( on an _ anti de sitter _ ( ads ) background ) and a strongly - coupled four - dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) has been generalized and exploited in other branches of physics . at present , the range of applications of the ads - cft correspondence includes problems as diverse as electronic transport properties @xcite , quantum critical dynamics @xcite , and the physics of strongly coupled quark - gluon plasmas @xcite . the efforts to apply the ads - cft correspondence to other strongly - coupled models continue , but the problem of pushing it beyond a conjecture into a rigorous mathematical statement remains .",
    "we think that turning the ads - cft correspondence into a mathematically rigorous duality is essential to understanding its potential generalizations .",
    "these examples ( old and new ) attest to the power of dualities and justifies the efforts of numerous researchers to exploit them to address hard problems by simple , elegant means .",
    "this article is a self - contained exposition of extensive original developments , including many new dualities and self - dual models , in the general bond - algebraic theory of dualities first introduced in reference @xcite ( bond algebras have also been employed in the analysis and spectral resolution of exactly solvable models @xcite , but this application is not discussed in this paper ) . in the context of some specific models , quantum dualities have been well understood for many years .",
    "reference @xcite introduced a coherent framework supporting a systematic study of both quantum _ and _ classical dualities on an equal footing , and providing a systematic way to compute dual ( disorder ) variables .",
    "the new , unified , theory that emerges is rigorous , easy to use , algorithmic , and of practical significance to theoretical studies and numerical simulations .",
    "it has the potential to provide invaluable insight into a myriad of pressing problems that are beyond perturbation theory .",
    "our theory of dualities rests on a single key observation : the _ bonds or interactions _ of a hamiltonian or transfer matrix are more relevant to a duality transformation than the elementary degrees of freedom . those bonds , or interaction terms , are organized into a _ bond algebra_. in contrast , symmetries or properties of the elementary degrees of freedom are largely irrelevant from a duality mapping perspective @xcite .",
    "our bond - algebraic approach to dualities may shed light on problems like the characterization and classification of collective ( topological ) excitations of lattice models , and the ads - cft correspondence @xcite , when complemented with recent developments in the theory of dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians that meet basic physical requirements like causality are usually realized by adding together ( or integrating with a given measure in qft ) simple local or quasi - local operators , like few - body interactions and kinetic energy single - body operators .",
    "these operators ( or some simple function of them ) constitute the _ bond operators _ , or bonds for short .",
    "together they generate , in a sense to be specified in section [ sec3.2 ] , an operator von neumann algebra that we call a bond algebra .",
    "bond algebras are model - specific algebras of interactions that can be _ radically different _ from the algebras that embody elementary degrees of freedom like bosons , fermions , or spins .",
    "our new theory states that dualities are structure - preserving mappings ( homomorphisms ) of bond algebras , _ that are typically local in the bonds_. this _ purely algebraic _",
    "characterization is physically meaningful because homomorphism of bond algebras are _ always _ equivalent to a unitary transformation ( or , if gauge symmetries are involved , to a partial isometry ) connecting the hilbert spaces on which the two models connected by a duality are defined .",
    "thus quantum dualities are revealed as unitary transformations , and dual models must share identical spectra and level degeneracies ; that is , provided gauge symmetries are not involved",
    ". the precise connection between gauge symmetries and dualities will be one of the central themes of this paper .",
    "remarkably , these ideas can be extended to include classical dualities @xcite , thus unifying the theory of classical and quantum dualities in a way that had been overlooked up to now .",
    "the key is to notice that many problems in classical statistical physics can be formulated in terms of a transfer matrix or operator . in this context ,",
    "physical requirements like locality become manifest in the _ multiplicative _ structure of the transfer matrix or operator , that will be in general a _ product _ of local or quasi - local bonds .",
    "once the bonds are identified , the theory of dualities proceeds as before .",
    "thus , a duality mapping for the bond algebra of the transfer matrix realizes a dual transfer matrix that determines a dual representation @xmath1 of the partition function @xmath2 .",
    "but , since dualities are unitary transformations , it follows that @xmath3 .",
    "this is , in short , the bond - algebraic approach to classical dualities . in this way one can show , for instance , that the self - duality of the two - dimensional classical ising model @xcite , and the self - duality of the quantum ising chain @xcite are two manifestations of a symmetry possessed by one and the same bond algebra . but more importantly",
    ", we will illustrate in this paper that the bond - algebraic approach has the potential to extend classical dualities beyond its present boundaries , as set for example in the reviews @xcite ( see appendix [ appa ] ) .",
    "we think that this strongly indicates that our technique can be relevant to solving the open problem of constructing dual representations of non - abelian lattice models , although so far we have only some examples to support this claim .",
    "bond algebras are most efficient in revealing dualities because they are model ( hamiltonian / transfer matrix)-specific , and thus capture , in the form of a local mapping , the precise information that makes two operators dual .",
    "this is different from techniques based on essentially fixed mappings , like generalized jordan - wigner transformations @xcite .",
    "these transformations are isomorphisms ( that we call _ dictionaries _ ) connecting operator algebras ( i.e. , _ languages _ ) , typically representing elementary degrees of freedom",
    ". since these dictionaries are insensitive to the specific structure of physical models , they can easily spoil important physical characteristics , as illustrated by standard fermionization in more than one space dimension .",
    "however , it is important to underscore that a bond algebra is _ not _ uniquely determined by the hamiltonian / transfer matrix that motivates its definition , but rather by the choice of bond decomposition of those operators . since",
    "that choice is not unique , ( i ) any single hamiltonian may produce many different bond algebras , and ( ii ) any one bond algebra may be related to many different hamiltonians .",
    "this flexibility is essential for classification purposes and to the success of our technique .",
    "it enables us to explore a variety of bond algebras for one and the same hamiltonian / transfer matrix to capture its full range of dual representations .",
    "similarly , it allow us to apply one and the same duality mapping to different problems .",
    "the self - duality for the spin @xmath4 xy model in a transverse field of section [ sec3.10.2 ] provides an example of the first observation ( i ) above . in this case",
    ", the self - duality _ emerges _ on a special line in coupling space , and it takes a special choice of bonds to generate the bond algebra that makes this self - duality apparent . the second observation ( ii )",
    "is illustrated by the new dualities of section [ sec3.6 ] for the quantum heisenberg model in any number of space dimensions @xmath5 .",
    "these dualities for a _ non - abelian _ model are based on dualities for the ( abelian ! ) @xmath5-dimensional quantum ising model and highlight some difficulties with the standard notion of non - abelian dualities @xcite .",
    "they point to the fact that the concepts of symmetry and duality are quite often inaccurately related .",
    "while symmetries of a theory represent isomorphisms leaving the hamiltonian invariant , ( self-)dualities do not preserve the form of the theory , but rather preserve its spectrum and level degeneracies .",
    "the relevance of bonds over elementary degrees of freedom is further emphasized by the fact that dualities are _ local _ transformations in terms of bonds , while they are _ non - local _ when described in terms of elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "this follows because one can invert the relations between bonds and elementary degrees of freedom to obtain the latter as non - local functions of the bonds .",
    "once this is done , one can compute the action of the duality mapping on the elementary degrees of freedom , to obtain their dual image .",
    "since dualities are structure - preserving mappings , these _ dual _ elementary degrees of freedom are guaranteed to be equivalent to the original ones .",
    "this _ systematic derivation _ of ( non - local in general ) dual variables ( elementary degrees of freedom ) from more basic , local objects is extremely important , not only because it establishes a bridge between the bond - algebraic and the traditional approach to quantum dualities , but also because dual variables can have a fundamental physical meaning as ( generalized ) _ disorder variables _ @xcite .",
    "starting with any specific bond algebra , one can proceed to look systematically for its alternative realizations that feature local representations of the bond generators . _",
    "any of these realizations defines a duality _ ( realizations that feature non - local representations of the bond generators can appear , but",
    "would typically be discarded in practice ) .",
    "this simple premise can lead to surprising results , as we will see often in this paper .",
    "exact dimensional reduction can appear as a duality , and , as illustrated by our new derivation of the jordan - wigner transformation , _ statistical transmutation _ can appear as a duality too .",
    "_ symmetry transmutation _ is also not unusual as illustrated for example by our new derivation of the duality between the xy and solid - on - solid ( sos ) models , obtained here for the first time _ without invoking the villain approximation _",
    "( symmetry transmutation here refers to the fact that the @xmath6 symmetry group of the xy model is not isomorphic , but rather the pontryagin dual of the @xmath7 symmetry group of the sos model ) .",
    "but perhaps what is most surprising about bond - algebraic dualities is their capability to _ dispose of gauge symmetries _ , as we explain next .",
    "gauge symmetries are constraints on the state hilbert space , encoded in a large set of local operators that commute with the hamiltonian , and with any other ( measurable ) observable .",
    "since bonds are in general measurable , local observables , they generate a bond algebra of gauge - invariant operators .",
    "this has the remarkable consequence that bond algebras of gauge models can have dual representations on state spaces of lower dimensionality ( a fact that should not be confused with an _ emergent _ duality as described in section [ sec3.11 ] ) .",
    "we call these dualities gauge - reducing ; they map the original gauge model to a model with less , or simply without gauge symmetries , and are represented by _",
    "homomorphisms _ of bond algebras , rather than isomorphisms . unlike ordinary dualities that are unitarily implementable ,",
    "gauge - reducing dualities are implemented by partial isometries ( one can think of a partial isometry as a rectangular unitary matrix , that either maps a state to zero or to an isometric ( equal norm ) state ) .",
    "but in spite of these mathematical twists , dualities are just as easy to detect in gauge theories as in any other model .",
    "that is because , while gauge symmetries do affect the algebra of elementary degrees of freedom , _ they do not affect the algebraic relations between bonds_. thus bond - algebraic dualities may provide in some instances a practical solution to the problem of eliminating gauge constraints .",
    "this paper describes in detail the mathematics and multiple applications of these ideas to models with _",
    "abelian _ gauge symmetries .",
    "_ non - abelian _ gauge symmetries abide by the same principles but are technically more involved , so we defer their complete treatment to future publications .",
    "this article contains many new results and is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2.1 ] starts with a discussion of the different physical contexts in which dualities have been introduced , followed in section [ sec2.2 ] by a more detailed discussion of what was known about quantum dualities prior to the publication of reference @xcite , the so - called standard approach .",
    "these discussions should help the reader put the subject of dualities , and some of the problems they address , in perspective .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains all the important formal developments related to the bond - algebraic approach to dualities .",
    "overall it is devoted to quantum dualities and their intimate connection to classical dualities , mainly discussing every major new idea and mathematical technique that is of relevance .",
    "we start by studying bond algebras in sections [ sec3.2 ] and [ sec3.3 ] .",
    "our new definition of quantum dualities as mappings of bond algebras is presented in section [ sec3.4 ] , and the next section explains how the standard approach described in section [ sec2.2 ] follows immediately from the bond - algebraic formalism ( determination of dual variables ) .",
    "section [ sec3.6 ] discusses critically the notion of non - abelian duality , in the light of new dualities for the quantum heisenberg model , and section [ sec3.7 ] develops new boundary conditions that preserve duality properties _ in finite size systems_. section [ sec3.8 ] expands , in more concrete terms , on the connection between bond algebra mappings and unitary transformations .",
    "the remaining sections are devoted to deriving and explaining the precise relations between self - dualities , standard quantum symmetries , section [ sec3.9 ] , and disorder variables , section [ sec3.10 ] , and the novel concept of emergent duality , section [ sec3.11 ] .",
    "disorder variables can be systematically determined from bond - algebraic dual mappings and they share an interesting relation with topological excitations .",
    "section [ sec3.12 ] explains how bond - algebraic dualities afford a practical way to eliminate gauge symmetries completely , and finally section [ classical&quantum ] explains how many classical dualities follow from bond - algebraic techniques .",
    "the rest of the article is dedicated to unveil old and discover new dualities in a broad spectrum of problems of physical relevance .",
    "there are so many examples that in the following we only indicate a few of them .",
    "sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] exemplify the many ideas ideas and techniques developed in section [ sec3 ] with self - dualities and dualities in quantum lattice models , of arbitrary spatial dimensions , mainly of interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , section [ sec5.5 ] describes a new duality for the extended kitaev toric code model in arbitrary space dimensions to a well known model of hamiltonian lattice field theory , the @xmath0 abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "the application of bond - algebraic techniques to qft is developed in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "sometimes we show results directly in the continuum but we want to stress the fact that the lattice hamiltonian formalism is the most convenient approach for interacting field theories .",
    "we study in full detail compact and non - compact versions of quantum electrodynamics in various spatial dimensions and make an attempt to introduce a version of quantum electrodynamics without vector potential . in section [ sec6.4 ]",
    "we introduce a new family of self - dual models related to the abelian higgs model , we prove the quantum stckelberg model to be self - dual in two - dimensions in section [ sec_stuckel ] , and section [ 6.8 ] discusses self - dual field theories that display the phenomenon of _ dimensional reduction _ of prime interest in the theory of topological quantum order @xcite .",
    "section [ sec8 ] presents several problems of classical statistical mechanics whose duality properties are uncovered by our bond - algebraic approach .",
    "section [ sec8.2 ] describes duality properties of the ising model in the utiyama lattice , while the vector potts model in two dimensions is not only studied in great detail in section [ sec8.3 ] but also it is shown how to modify it to make it self - dual for arbitrary couplings and states .",
    "building upon these ideas we introduce a new self - dual @xmath8-state approximation to four - dimensional lattice electrodynamics in section [ sec8.4 ] .",
    "section [ eightvertexm ] establishes a link between the eight - vertex model ( in its ashkin - teller representation ) and the quantum anisotropic heisenberg model , based on duality mappings rather than integrability .",
    "the general connection between quantum and classical disorder variables is discussed in section [ appb ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec9 ] presents several important applications and consequences of dualities .",
    "those include general properties of the spectrum of self - dual theories and the way to extract exact relevant information in presence of phase transitions , and most importantly a new way to look at _ fermionization in arbitrary spatial dimensions _ as a general duality mapping .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate how the jordan - wigner transformation is a consequence of bond algebraic duality mappings when these are applied to nearest - neighbor spinless fermion and spin @xmath9 systems on a chain .",
    "we further show , how _ no such duality can map _ all ( real - space ) nearest - neighbor spinless fermi hopping terms to all spin @xmath9 exchange terms on general lattices ( and viceversa ) in spatial dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "that is , in general , no extension of the @xmath11 jordan - wigner transformation that connects all such individual _ local terms _ can appear in higher dimensions .",
    "we show , however , that notwithstanding it is possible to fermionize spin systems in @xmath10 dimensions ( such as the @xmath12 quantum ising model ) via a gauge reducing duality .",
    "thus we further extend and formalize , via the systematics of bond algebras , the scope of known systems that can be fermionized . in section [ sec_tqo_dim ]",
    "we examine the connection between the phenomenon of dimensional reduction and duality in the context of topological quantum order systems @xcite .",
    "we also indicate the most natural way to classify these systems in terms of so - called @xmath5-dimensional gauge - like symmetries as opposed to using a particular measure of entanglement since no single measure can uniquely characterize a quantum state .",
    "the appendices , a total of five , contain not only technical details omitted in the text for pedagogical reasons but also some relevant mathematical expressions not found in the literature , so we advice the reader to consider consulting them if he or she wants to get a deeper understanding of the subject .",
    "this short section discusses dualities in physics from a historical perspective .",
    "mainstream , traditional ideas about dualities in field theory , classical statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics are summarized and illustrated with key examples .      the first appearance of the term _ duality _ can be traced back to the early days of electromagnetism as a field theory . in 1884 , heaviside recast maxwell s equations in vector form @xcite , in the absence of sources , @xmath13 ( in rationalized heaviside - lorentz units , and the speed of light @xmath14 ) , and pointed out that the _ duality _ @xmath15 maps solutions of these equations to other solutions .",
    "this notion of duality stresses _ symmetries of the equations of motion _ showing that different physical quantities are interchangeable .",
    "two of maxwell s equations can be solved by introducing a four - vector potential @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , that is related to @xmath18 and @xmath19 through the antisymmetric field - strength tensor @xmath20 then the remaining maxwell s equations read ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22 this formalism is essential for well know reasons , but the ( self-)duality of maxwell s equations is not readily reflected by equation , partly because the gauge transformation , with arbitrary scalar function @xmath23 , @xmath24 leaves the em field @xmath25 unchanged but renders @xmath16 unobservable .",
    "this motivates one of this paper s central theme : the interplay between dualities and gauge symmetries .",
    "a second , seemingly very different , concept of duality was developed in the early 1940s in the context of _ classical _ statistical mechanics .",
    "it originated in the work of kramers and wannier @xcite on the two - dimensional ( @xmath26 ) ising model on a square lattice , with partition function @xmath27 .\\ ] ] here @xmath28 stands for a classical spin degree of freedom located on the vertex ( site ) @xmath29 , @xmath30 , of a square lattice with unit vectors @xmath31 , see figure [ notation_links ] .",
    "the exchange constant is @xmath32 , with @xmath33 temperature and @xmath34 boltzmann s constant .",
    "kramers and wannier noticed that @xmath35 satisfies a relation @xmath36 that , since @xmath37 connects the high - temperature ( weak @xmath38 ) behavior of the ising model to its low temperature ( strong @xmath38 ) behavior ( @xmath39 is a known , analytic ( non - singular ) proportionality factor ) .",
    "it follows that every singularity of @xmath40 at coupling @xmath38 must be matched by another singularity at a corresponding dual coupling @xmath41 , so that if @xmath35 has only one phase transition ( one singularity ) at a critical coupling @xmath42 , it must be located at the self - dual point @xmath43 . then from equation @xmath44 which determines the _ exact _ critical temperature of the ising model @xmath45 ( in units of @xmath46 ) .",
    "this spectacular result drew considerable attention to duality transformations , and soon after the publication of reference @xcite , wannier @xcite showed how to obtain duality relations of the form @xmath47 for ising models defined on nearly arbitrary planar lattices @xmath48 .",
    "these transformations where dubbed dualities @xcite because @xmath49 stands for the lattice dual to @xmath48 ( _ dual _ here is used in the sense of old algebraic topology , see for instance , reference @xcite , chapter iv , section 6 . )",
    "dual lattices are defined in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "we see from equation that the ising model on a square lattice is self - dual partly because so is the square lattice , while the ising model on a triangular lattice is dual to that same model on a hexagonal lattice ( and viceversa ) .",
    "this last duality is part of a simple approach to determining these models critical temperature @xcite .",
    "potts extended the duality transformation of wannier to some of the models now known under his name in his 1952 paper @xcite .",
    "it was wegner , however , who uncovered the general structure underlying dualities , by showing in his 1973 paper @xcite that duality transformations could be obtained for a wide class of models ( including models in more than two dimensions ) by considering the ( group - theoretical ) fourier transform of individual boltzmann weights .",
    "the 1975 paper @xcite popularized wegner s approach to the point that it became the standard , traditional approach to classical dualities .",
    "this traditional approach is described thoroughly in the review articles by savit @xcite and malyshev and petrova @xcite , but it is also summarized in appendix [ appa ] ( see reference @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) .    the key fact that the notion of a fourier transform exists for _ any _ group allows for application of the traditional approach to produce dual representations of any _ abelian _ model displaying appropriate interactions , but it is impossible to take the same traditional approach to produce dual representations for lattice _",
    "non - abelian _ models ( that is , models like wilson s non - abelian lattice gauge theories ) .",
    "to construct dual representations of such models remains one of the most difficult open problems in the theory of dualities @xcite ( let us point out that _ abelian _ and _ non - abelian _ here does not refer to the symmetry group of the model of interest , but rather to the nature of that model s degrees of freedom , see section [ sec3.6 ] ) .    yet a third concept of duality was developed for _ quantum _ many - body problems in the late 1970s , mainly in a series of papers @xcite concerned with hamiltonian lattice quantum field theory ( lqft ) . starting with reference @xcite ,",
    "these papers settled a notion of quantum duality that we interpret and formalize as follows : two hamiltonians @xmath50(o_\\gamma),\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ h_2[\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\cdots](o_\\gamma),\\ ] ] that feature coupling constants @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and elementary degrees of freedom @xmath53 labelled by some labels @xmath54 are _ dual _ if there exists an _",
    "alternative representation _",
    "@xmath55 of the algebra of the @xmath53 such that @xmath56(o_\\gamma)= h_2[\\lambda_1^*,\\lambda_2^*,\\cdots](\\hat{o}_\\gamma).\\ ] ] that is , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are dual if they are equal up to an _ operator change of variables _ @xmath59 , together with a readjustment of couplings @xmath60 . in summary , we have described notions of duality that arose in three different fields of physics .",
    "it is not clear a _ a priori _ that they are related beyond general , conceptual features , but we will show in this paper that there is a common mathematical background underlying all three of them .",
    "as described near the end of the last section , quantum dualities have the following far reaching consequence : if equation holds , it must be that the energy spectra of the two dual hamiltonians satisfy @xmath61 this suggests that a quantum duality may be a unitary equivalence of the form @xmath62(o_\\gamma)\\ , \\mathcal{u}^{\\dagger}_{\\sf d}=h_2[\\lambda_1^*,\\lambda_2^*,\\cdots](\\hat{o}_\\gamma),\\ ] ] that would imply equation right away . surprisingly , the definition of quantum dualities just introduced seems to be incompatible with equation , as we will explain below .",
    "let us consider a specific , non - trivial example in detail , the quantum , one - dimensional ( @xmath11 ) ising model in a transverse field ( or `` quantum ising chain '' for short ) , specified by the hamiltonian @xmath63(\\sigma)=\\ \\sum_i\\ ( h\\sigma^x_i+\\ j\\sigma^z_i\\sigma^z_{i+1 } ) \\label{infinite_ising_transverse}.\\ ] ] @xmath64 features @xmath9 spins located at each site @xmath65 of a chain , represented by pauli matrices @xmath66 .",
    "they constitute the elementary degrees of freedom that were denoted by @xmath67 near the end of last section .",
    "the goal is to show , along the lines of equation that @xmath64 is self - dual ( that is , dual to itself ) .",
    "so we must find a new representation @xmath68 of the pauli matrices and new values @xmath69 of the couplings so that @xmath70(\\sigma)= h_{\\sf i}[h^*,j^*](\\mu)$ ] .",
    "since we know from the exact solution of @xmath64 @xcite that its energy levels are symmetric in @xmath71 ( so that @xmath72 ) , we set @xmath73 and @xmath74 . we are left then with the problem of finding an appropriate dual representation of the pauli matrices .",
    "the equality @xmath75 suggests setting up the relations , @xmath76 as underscored by the question marks in equation , we have to decide what @xmath77 and @xmath78 should be .",
    "the obvious choice @xmath79 leads to @xmath80 on the other hand , if the new spin variables @xmath81 exist at all , they must satisfy @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 but then we see from equations and that @xmath84 _ commutes _ with @xmath85 .",
    "let us set then @xmath86 and @xmath87 in equation , so that @xmath88 the solution to _ this _ set of equations is @xmath89 and now @xmath84 , @xmath85 do satisfy the correct spin-1/2 algebra .",
    "this completes the proof in the traditional approach to quantum dualities that @xmath64 is self - dual @xcite .    admitting that this example is a fair representation of an  average \" quantum duality",
    ", we can infer that    1 .",
    "quantum dualities need not be strong - coupling / weak coupling relations ; 2",
    ".   quantum dualities are _  fundamentally \" non - local _ , 3 .",
    "quantum dualities are _ not _ unitarily implementable .",
    "the last statement follows from this simple observation .",
    "suppose we could recast the self - duality of the ising chain as a unitary equivalence @xmath90\\mathcal{u}_{\\sf d}^\\dagger= h_{\\sf i}[j , h]$ ] .",
    "then we would have that @xmath91\\mathcal{u}_{\\sf d}^\\dagger=",
    "\\mathcal{u}_{\\sf d}\\left(\\sum_i\\ j\\sigma^z_i\\sigma^z_{i+1}\\right ) \\mathcal{u}_{\\sf d}^\\dagger = h_{\\sf i}[j,0]=\\sum_i\\ j\\sigma^x_i,\\ ] ] but this can not possibly be right , because @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] _ have different level degeneracies_. this is not to say , however , that the traditional approach , based on operator changes of variables , goes successfully beyond unitary equivalence .",
    "equation implies that @xmath94 if the @xmath95 are truly an alternative representation of the pauli matrices , this equation can not possibly be right either , for the same reasons as before .",
    "this section is devoted to explaining our theory of quantum and classical dualities based on bond algebras , and it discusses every major new idea and mathematical technique that we introduce to the subject ( some of them advanced in reference @xcite ) .",
    "we will argue that    1 .",
    "quantum and ( a very large class of ) classical dualities are unitary equivalences ( or projective unitary equivalences if the duality eliminates gauge symmetries ) , and that 2 .",
    "the easiest way to search for dualities is to look for structure - preserving mappings between hamiltonian - dependent _ bond algebras _ , section [ sec3.8 ] .",

    "then we get two bond algebras that are clearly different , @xmath122 since @xmath123 is commutative while @xmath124 is not .",
    "this flexibility of the concept of bond algebra turns out to be an essential advantage .",
    "_ applications dictate what bond decomposition is best for any given problem_.    the complexity of a bond algebra can vary , and a practical measure of that complexity is simply afforded by considering the hilbert space @xmath125 on which the bond algebra acts on",

    "@xmath127 , where the index set @xmath128 is infinite , so that @xmath125 is an _ infinite tensor product _ @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath129 .",
    "the first scenario ( 1 ) is elementary ( bond algebras are then just matrix algebras ) , and ( 2 ) is moderately simple , but ( 3 ) is directly connected to the thermodynamic limit and/or the continuum limit of qfts @xcite , and it is the source of endless fascination and complications . in practice , problems in ( 3 ) must be regularized ( turned into problems in ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) ) before any progress can be made ( see appendix [ appe ] on lqft ) .",

    "the dual variables are guaranteed to satisfy the same algebra as the original variables @xmath219 .",
    "but we can view this from a different perspective .",
    "the fact that the dual variables satisfy the correct algebra affords an independent check supporting that @xmath181 is indeed an isomorphism , and thus the relations that were assumed to characterize the bond algebra are complete .    in summary ,",

    "any permutation of the three bond types ( or any bonds more generally in other systems ) can , of course , be written as a product of pairwise permutation operators of the form of equation ( [ pair_permute ] ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath283    similar to the group @xmath284 , we might embed other finite groups as acting on a finite number of bond types .      up to now",
    "we have only considered bond algebras of infinite systems .",
    "this has advantages and disadvantages . on one hand ,",
    "the bond algebras are mathematically well defined , and the bond algebra mappings of interest are typically simple . on the other hand ,",
    "it is of great interest to study the action of these mappings on operators that are infinite combinations of bonds ( e.g. , the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this may be a concern because those operators need to be defined in the infinite tensor product space where the bond algebra acts .",
    "we saw in section [ sec3.5 ] some of the problems that can arise from trying to extend the action of bond algebra mappings to infinite combinations of bonds .",
    "let us take a look at these problems from a slightly different perspective that will be useful later in this section .",

    "this problem was already pointed out in section [ sec2.2 ] from a different but equivalent perspective . in general ,",
    "duality mappings established in the limit of infinite size , or in the continuum as in qft ( see section [ sec6 ] ) , are well defined on finite combinations of bonds , but have ill - defined actions on for example global symmetries that involve infinite combinations of bonds .",
    "the practical solution to these problems is to work with bond algebras of finite - size systems , and eventually take the thermodynamic limit if one is interested in the infinite - size system .",
    "but typically , standard boundary conditions ( bcs ) ( open , periodic , anti - periodic , etc . ) may spoil duality properties that are apparent in the infinite- size limit .",
    "for example , both open and periodic bcs , @xmath290 spoil the self - duality @xmath291 of the quantum ising chain , and the same happens with many other ( self-)dualities .    on the other hand , bcs can help to restore in finite - size systems properties of the thermodynamic limit like translation invariance .",
    "similarly , bond algebras can be exploited to find in a systematic way _ model specific _ bcs that restore duality properties @xcite .",
    "this is an impressive advantage of the bond - algebraic over the traditional approach , because it puts models that are _ exactly _ dual or self - dual at reach of computer simulations ( the role of bcs in connection to dualities was noticed from time to time in the literature in the context of specific models , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "let us see how this works with the models of equations and .",
    "more complicated examples will be discussed in later sections .",
    "intuitively speaking , the hamiltonian @xmath292 of equation should not be self dual , because it has @xmath96 bonds @xmath188 , but only @xmath293 bonds @xmath196 .",

    "this is important because we would like to compute @xmath319 and check that no inconsistency arises , and it is easy to solve .",
    "the trick is to add @xmath318 to the list of bond generators , i.e. , bond algebra , _ but not to _ @xmath316 , and extend the action of @xmath181 consistently . in this case",

    "this is intimately connected to the topic of section [ sec3.9 ] , and it is important in practice to remember that the action of a duality on a non - local symmetry can not be understood with any precision in the formal limit of infinite size or in the continuum ( where , on the other hand , dualities are most easily spotted ! ) .",

    "one easy way to check the correctness of the self - duality mapping of equation ( with corrected boundary term ) is to compute the dual variables , and check that they satisfy the correct pauli algebra .",
    "the problem with this plan is that all the bonds in @xmath329 commute with the symmetry @xmath336 , and so the individual spins @xmath211 , @xmath337 can not possibly be in the bond algebra . the solution is to add one spin , say @xmath309 to the set of bond generators , _ but not to @xmath329_. in this way , we extend the bond algebra to include all the @xmath211 without spoiling the fact that @xmath329 is self - dual , provided we can extend the action of the self - duality isomorphism to @xmath309 in a consistent fashion .    for the sake of concreteness , let us see how this works when there are only @xmath338 spins in the chain . then the self - duality isomorphism @xmath339 can be extended to @xmath340 as @xmath341 preserving all the algebraic relations .",

    "we think this is a misnomer for the following reasons : as argued , self - dualities are usually unitarily implementable transformations . however , while quantum symmetries are trivial isomorphisms that leave the hamiltonian @xmath105 invariant , self - duality transformations do not preserve the form of @xmath105 , but rather preserve its spectrum and level degeneracies . in a sense ,",
    "self - dualities capture non - trivial isomorphisms aside from the more trivial case of symmetries that leave @xmath105 itself invariant .",
    "one basic connection between symmetries and dualities is that symmetries control the variety of ways in which dualities can manifest themselves",

    "this is easy to understand on general grounds , now that we know that dualities are unitary equivalences . for suppose that you have two different dualities @xmath198 and @xmath362 that connect hamiltonians @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath363 then @xmath364 so that @xmath365 is a symmetry of @xmath57 , and @xmath366 is a symmetry of @xmath58 .",

    "these connections could be used to unveil hidden symmetries through dualities .",
    "the connection between dualities and symmetries is even stronger for self - dual models @xcite .",

    "this is an especially attractive possibility for models that exhibit a phase transition at the self - dual point , but in fact , it can be excluded on general principles . for suppose that one could find a self - duality transformation @xmath378 that depends on some set of continuous coordinates @xmath379 , so that @xmath380\\ ,   \\mathcal{u}^\\dagger_\\d(\\theta)=h[\\lambda_2,\\lambda_1,\\cdots]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any value of @xmath381 , _ independently of the values of the couplings in @xmath105_. such a group of self - duality unitaries would become an extra continuous symmetry of the model at the self - dual point .",
    "but this is impossible , because @xmath382 must be a symmetry always .",
    "then , taking @xmath383 infinitesimal so that @xmath384 , we see that the generators @xmath385 must always commute with @xmath105 .",

    ", \\mathcal{u}^\\dagger_{\\sf d}(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\cdots)= h[\\lambda_2,\\lambda_1,\\cdots],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this is in fact the case for the spin @xmath9 xy model discussed in section [ sec3.11 ] .",
    "but this would not turn the self - duality at the self - dual point into continuous symmetry either .",
    "rather , one would have a discrete set of symmetries , one discrete set for each value of the self - dual coupling @xmath388 .    in closing ,",
    "let us mention briefly two examples .",
    "consider first the finite , open , self - dual quantum ising chain @xmath389 introduced in section [ sec3.7 ] , equation .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath390 ( there is no need to compute @xmath198 explicitly , just to note that @xmath198 implements the mapping defined in equation ) . at the self - dual point @xmath391 ,",
    "@xmath198 becomes a non - trivial discrete symmetry of the model , the generator of a @xmath0 symmetry group for @xmath389 .",
    "this is especially interesting , since the standard @xmath0 symmetry of the ising model is broken by the self - dual boundary term @xmath392 . for the _ infinite _ quantum ising chain , we have from equation that @xmath393 thus @xmath394 generates lattice translations to the left .      recognizing that self - dualities are unitary equivalences has consequences that go beyond symmetry , and are intimately tied to the behavior of the quantum fluctuations that compete at a quantum phase transition . for self - dual models , there is a natural way to associate a disorder parameter to any order parameter ( and viceversa ) , through the self - duality unitary , and moreover , the eigenstates of the self - duality unitary are states at which the expectation value of a pair of  duality - conjugate \" observables _ are equal_. while these states are not specially meaningful at general couplings , at the self - dual point they can be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( because the self - duality becomes a symmetry at the self - dual point ) .",
    "the general setting we are going to consider in this section is that of a self - dual hamiltonian @xmath177 $ ] depending on any number of parameters @xmath178 , with dual parameters @xmath180 defined by @xmath395=\\mathcal{u}_\\d\\,h[\\lambda]\\,\\mathcal{u}_\\d^\\dagger.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observable @xmath396 dual - conjugate to @xmath182 is defined by the equation @xmath397 for example , @xmath398 $ ] is the dual - conjugate of @xmath177 $ ] , and for the ising models studied in section [ sec3.7 ] , the dual - conjugates of the spin operators @xmath399 are the dual variables @xmath68 of equations and .",
    "the first interesting consequence of this definition is that , _ relative to self - duality eigenstates @xmath400 _ , @xmath401 pairs of observables that are dual - conjugate have identical expectation values , @xmath402 , where the states @xmath400 can be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath198 and @xmath403 $ ] ( since @xmath198 is a symmetry of @xmath105 at the self - dual point ) .",
    "next we would like to compare expectation values of dual - conjugate pairs relative to arbitrary states @xmath404 .",
    "for this it is convenient to specialize the discussion to self - dualities that are their own inverses , so that @xmath405 it is often possible to arrange for this to be the case , thanks to the freedom in choosing @xmath198 discussed in the previous section .",
    "then , we have on one hand that @xmath406 where @xmath407 but thanks to equation , a completely analogous relation holds for @xmath142 : @xmath408 it is in this specific sense that @xmath142 and @xmath409 show perfectly complementary behavior .",
    "let us apply these general results to quantum phase transitions .",
    "let @xmath410 denote a ground state for @xmath177 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath411 is a ground state for @xmath398 $ ] , that we denote @xmath412 .",
    "it follows that @xmath413 hence , if the mean value of @xmath182 happens to be related to the _ order parameter _ associated with a phase transition that takes place as the couplings @xmath202 are changed , it follows immediately from the two relations above that @xmath396 represents an operator related to the _ disorder parameter_.    consider for illustration the quantum ising chain , and set @xmath414 , so that the dual @xmath180 , resulting from the self - duality transformation @xmath415 , is @xmath416 .",
    "then we have that @xmath417 equation demonstrates that the string operator of equation is the disorder variable conjugate to the order variable @xmath211 @xcite . the relation between our bond - algebraic approach to _ quantum disorder variables _ and the work of kadanoff and ceva @xcite on ( commutative ) algebras in the _ classical _ @xmath26 ising model is elaborated on in section [ appb ] .",
    "our bond - algebraic approach generalizes the work of @xcite . here",
    "we would like to point out that in reference @xcite , it was argued ( only in the context of the @xmath26 ising model ) that the product of an order and a neighboring disorder variable should behave as a fermion .",
    "this is largely satisfied by our operator order and disorder quantum variables for the quantum ising chain .",
    "if we define @xmath418 then it will be easy to check that the operator @xmath419 represents a majorana fermion , that is , a dirac fermion that is self - conjugate ( and consequently , its own anti - particle ) .",
    "for the current purposes , it suffices to mention that majorana fermions can be expressed in terms of ( spinless ) fermion creation / annihilation operators and satisfy the following anti - commutation relations @xmath420 this enables the standard jordan - wigner transformation @xcite that maps @xmath9 spin degrees of freedom into spinless fermions ( and viceversa ) .",
    "it seems to be a general feature of @xmath11 quantum models that the product of the order and disorder variables satisfies simple and interesting algebraic relations .",
    "unfortunately , this pattern seems to break down in higher dimensions .",
    "two standard ways to simplify models in condensed matter physics are to restrict couplings to take very special values , and/or project out some states of the full state space .",
    "a typical example is the @xmath421-@xmath422 model @xcite , that is obtained as a projection from the hubbard model in the strong - coupling limit . in this section ,",
    "we explain how emergent ( self-)dual properties can appear in the effective models that come out of such manipulations @xcite , even when the starting models are not ( self-)dual to start with .",
    "we discuss the two scenarios ( special couplings versus reduced state space ) separately for simplicity , but examples more complex than the ones we are going to consider can well present a blend of both .      the projection of a hamiltonian , and a corresponding bond algebra , into a sector ( subspace ) @xmath423 of the full state space @xmath125 , produces a _ new _ bond algebra that may , or may not , have new algebraic and duality properties .",
    "for instance , bonds that do not commute in general may commute when projected onto certain sectors , or vanish ( thus reducing the number of relations that characterize the algebra ) .",
    "hence it may well be that the projected bond algebra enjoys ( self-)dualities that are not available for the full model .",
    "more precisely , a projection will always change the structure of the bond algebra , unless the projector @xmath424 commutes with all the bonds . to see this ,",
    "notice that the following relation always holds @xmath425 so , projection always preserve the linear structure .",
    "problems can develop with respect to the multiplicative structure , since @xmath426 will generally hold only if for all @xmath54 , @xmath427=0.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ] ] if this is the case , then @xmath428 and the projection process preserves ( to some extent ) the structure of the bond algebra ( in other words , the mapping @xmath429 is an algebra homomorphism ) .    however , it is unlikely that the projections of physical interest will preserve the bond algebra as in equation , and so we can expect that the effective , projected model will have a different bond algebra ( gauge models represent the most important exception to this rule , see the next section ) .",
    "we call _ emergent dualities _ those dualities that are brought about by this change in the bond algebra due to a projection ( or a special fixing of the couplings , like in the next subsection ) , to stress that these dualities _ emerge _ in some sector of the theory but need not be exact relations for the full system .    in many instances ,",
    "the sector of interest is that of low energies . at low temperatures ,",
    "the system becomes more and more confined to this hilbert space sector ( especially so when spectral gaps are present between the low energy sector of @xmath105 and all other excited states ) .",
    "it is important to appreciate that emergent dualities must be unitarily implementable , just as ordinary dualities , with the extra freedom that the unitary transformations need only be defined on certain subspaces such as that spanned by the low energy states .    to make this lucid , we now consider two examples .",
    "the first example is afforded by the elementary hamiltonian @xmath430 with the angular momentum operator @xmath431 .",
    "if one takes its domain to be the full hilbert space of wave - functions on the circle @xmath432 , then @xmath433 is not bounded below .",

    "we will indicate how to construct them in general , and write them explicitly for the simplest case of just two sites ( @xmath343 ) .",

    "the next step is to figure out whether the single spins @xmath488 , @xmath310 are elements in the bond algebra generated by @xmath473 , @xmath489 .",

    "@xcite , it is argued that self - dualities are unitary transformations _ that exchange the kinetic with the potential energy term _ in a hamiltonian , and since these two terms must have different spectra for a non - abelian theory , a non - abelian self - duality can not exist .",

    "in this section we explain an extension of the notion of duality established in section [ sec3.8 ] that can accommodate changes in the dimension of the state space , and show its use to eliminate gauge symmetry constraints . in practice , however , we can potentially eliminate any _ local _ ( or in the language of reference @xcite , @xmath500 gauge - like ) symmetry in this way , so it is important to keep in mind that a local symmetry need not always be a gauge constraint that can be disposed of .",

    "this is not to say that all symmetries have the same physical meaning , nor the same mathematical consequences .",
    "there is a distinction between ordinary symmetries , like rotations in space , and gauge symmetries .",
    "ordinary symmetries have direct physical impact , since they can influence the level degeneracy of a hamiltonian ( and with it , its thermal physics , see appendix [ sec3.1 ] ) and constrain transition amplitudes to satisfy stringent selection rules . on the other hand ,",
    "gauge symmetries are _ constraints _ pointing to a fundamental redundancy .",
    "the state space of a model with gauge symmetries is _ larger than physical _ , meaning that it contains states that can not be prepared or observed by experimental means ( or may even contain states of negative norm ) .",
    "the _ sector of physical states _ is precisely that sector that is invariant under the action of all the gauge symmetries .",
    "similarly , hermitian operators that do not commute with the gauge symmetries are not observables , in the sense that its eigenvalues do not represent measurable quantities ( think , for example , of the vector potential in qed ) . in a gauge theory ,",
    "an observable must be hermitian , and commute with all the gauge symmetries .    in perspective , gauge symmetries are better thought of as constraints , and it may seem desirable to keep them conceptually far apart from ordinary symmetries .",
    "but it is unavoidable on first principles that quantum constraints may look just like a symmetry . for suppose",

    ". then it must be that @xmath502,\\ \\ \\ \\ ( \\mbox{consistent constrained dynamics}),\\ ] ] to ensure that the dynamics generated by @xmath105 is consistent with the constraint .",
    "then if @xmath501 is ( hermitian ) unitary , it will look just like ( the generator of ) a symmetry .    in practice",
    ", physical input is required to set apart constraints from symmetries .",
    "take , for example , the specification of the quantum statistics of identical particles .",
    "until pauli proposed his exclusion principle , it would have been natural to argue that the many - body schrdinger equation for indistinguishable particles had the group of permutations among its _",
    "symmetries_. it took the introduction of a _ new physical principle _ to show that these symmetries were in fact _",
    "constraints _ , or superselection rules , that select the fermionic or bosonic sector of fock space as the sector of physical states .",
    "if a quantum gauge theory arises from the quantization of a _ classical _ gauge theory , then there is no risk of confusing gauge and ordinary symmetries . on the other hand ,",
    "recent developments in condensed matter physics are fostering the development of quantum models that do not show an obvious classical limit , and that posses local symmetries that look much like gauge symmetries ( see , for example , kitaev s honeycomb model , discussed at the end of section [ sec3.6 ] , and section [ subsec3.12.3 ] ) .",
    "then , one is forced to face the problem of deciding whether these should be treated as ordinary symmetries , or as gauge symmetries ( constraints ) , in part because the ( self)-dualities available will depend drastically on which one it is .",
    "the problem could easily show up for effective theories of strongly correlated systems , where emergent symmetries @xcite could well be local .      in the light of the previous discussion",
    ", it would seem natural to assume that a duality between a model with and a model without gauge symmetries ( a gauge - reducing duality ) should be emergent , in the sense of section [ sec3.11 ] .",

    "but as it turns out , the bond - algebraic approach does not require the elimination of gauge symmetries to work , and that is why bond - algebraic dualities are practical tools for removing gauge symmetries .",
    "if one chooses the bond algebra of the gauge model wisely , one can find mappings that preserve all the algebraic relations to models that do not have any gauge symmetries .    to make these ideas more precise ,",

    "our bond - algebraic approach constitutes an excellent technique for detecting gauge - reducing dualities , in part because gauge symmetries are _ local _ in general .",
    "this makes possible to choose a set of bond generators such that each bond _ individually _ commutes with the gauge symmetries . in this way",
    "we gain direct access to the physical ( gauge - invariant ) algebra of interactions , and we can look for bond algebraic dualities to other representations that show _ no gauge symmetries_. we saw already a duality along these lines in section [ sec3.6 ] , when we studied a new duality for the abelian quantum ising and non - abelian heisenberg models in arbitrary dimension @xmath5 .",

    "to answer this question , we compute @xmath526 thus we see that @xmath181 is a gauge - reducing duality homomorphism , and that @xmath64 represents all the physics contained in @xmath504 , but without all the gauge redundancies .    since a gauge - invariant bond algebra captures the purely physical properties of the interactions , the equivalence ( duality ) between the two theories is self - evident in our formalism .",
    "the bond algebraic approach naturally includes gauge invariant wilson loops , aharonov - bohm phases , and the local fields @xmath527 as gauge invariant quantities constructed out of the individual bonds of the gauge theory .",
    "let us explain briefly how to construct the projective unitary that implements the mapping of equation .",
    "notice that the complete commuting set of observables @xmath528 , @xmath238 , is mapped to the set @xmath251 .",

    "while there are intuitive physical arguments to justify this ( namely , gauss law permits to measure the charge of a particle by measuring its electric field on the surface of a sphere _ arbitrarily far away from it _ ) , the fact is that sometimes completely gauge - reducing duals with local bonds are _ readily available _ ( like in the example of the previous section ) , and there is no need to exploit the systematic construction ( see sections [ sec5.3 ] , [ sec5.4 ] , [ sec5.5 ] , and [ sec6.4 ] ) .",
    "but sometimes the systematic construction seems to be the best we can do ( see section [ sec6.3 ] ) .    in this section , we describe the systematic construction for the @xmath0 gauge model of equation , to illustrate the ideas on which it rests ( these ideas are a reinterpretation and generalization in terms of bond algebras of an scheme introduced in reference @xcite to study the @xmath260 , @xmath0 gauge theory ) . the generalization to higher dimensions , other ( abelian ) gauge groups , and matter - coupled gauge theories is straightforward , and",

    "elementary as it is , this duality is noteworthy because the traditional approach to classical dualities described in appendix [ appa ] _ fails in the presence of a minimally coupled external field _ , and could not have been used to derive it .",

    "the classical self - duality embodied in equations and , valid for any @xmath96 , has not been written before in the literature despite its simplicity .",
    "it has , however , one remarkable feature : it is a duality for a model _ in a minimally - coupled external field _ , and dualities for such models are beyond the traditional approach as described in appendix [ appa ] , and references @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the standard approach relies on the fourier transform technique for establishing dualities , _ and _ , for these models with two - body interactions , on having individual boltzmann weights that define _ circulant matrices _",
    "but the boltzmann weights in @xmath633 can not be chosen to be circulant except if @xmath634 .",

    "thus , _ every quantum duality translates into a classical duality _ @xcite .",
    "notice that it is crucial that @xmath198 is a unitary or projective unitary , a fact that was overlooked in the past @xcite .    due to the results of section [ sec3.7 ] ,",
    "the duality relation can be made exact for _ any _ finite size system @xmath96 , and _ not _ just for the thermodynamic limit @xmath643 . rigorously speaking this is always the case , with quantum and classical dualities representing two sides of the same coin .",
    "on the other hand , there is a useful practical algorithm , that will be presented in section [ sec8 ] , that makes use of the stl decomposition and where the thermodynamic limit is , in principle , required @xcite .",
    "typically , the use of the stl decomposition implies that the derived classical model presents infinitesimally weak and infinitely - strong couplings , and so the classical dualities derived in this way are less clearly established .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that the classical model @xmath2 of equation depends on the quantum couplings @xmath202 not just through @xmath38 , in the sense that different quantum couplings can relate to qualitatively very different classical models ( and not just the same @xmath2 at different values of @xmath38 ) .",
    "for example , the stl decomposition maps a single quantum spin @xmath644 to the model of equation ( in the limit @xmath645 , _ provided @xmath646 _ ) , and not otherwise .",
    "similar constraints apply elsewhere . as dualities relate different regions in the coupling spaces of quantum problems , it is essential to keep track of exactly which classical problems may correspond to a given quantum system for each set of couplings .",
    "in this section , we will study two self - dual generalizations of the @xmath11 dimensional quantum ising chain : the quantum potts ( p ) and _ vector _ potts ( vp ) models ( also known as @xmath8-clock model @xcite ) .",
    "these models are just two special examples of a large class of @xmath261 clock models @xcite , that we discuss too , but very briefly .",

    "a finite temperature phase transition is characterized by a non - analyticity in the free energy of the system at the transition point ( or transition line , etc . ) .",
    "similarly , a zero temperature ( quantum ) phase transition relates a level crossing , or an avoided level crossing , and non - analyticities in the ground state energy of the quantum hamiltonian at hand .",
    "when present , a self - duality relates the energy levels ( and thus the free energy and all related thermodynamic quantities ) at one coupling ( or temperature ) to those at another coupling ( or temperature ) .",
    "thus , whenever a phase transition occurs at one value of the coupling @xmath202 it must also occur at the dual coupling @xmath180 .",
    "a corollary of the above is that ( 1 ) if the system exhibits an odd number of transitions as a function of @xmath202 then one transition must occur at the self - dual point @xmath1277 .",
    "similarly , ( 2 ) if an even number of transitions are present , then no phase transition can occur at @xmath1277 .",
    "a further consequence of self - dualities is that ( 3 ) if a system is devoid of transitions in a particular region @xmath1278 then it must also be devoid of transitions in the related dual region whose endpoints are given by @xmath1279 and @xmath1280 ( where @xmath1279 and @xmath1280 are the dual counterparts to @xmath1281 and @xmath1282 ) .",

    ", there is a region that is free of non - analyticities connecting the above two phases @xcite .",
    "the above three consequences , which can be appended by additional constraints that we will elaborate below , can be applied , mutatis mutandis , not only to questions concerning thermodynamic phase transitions but also to general non - equilibrium phenomena .",

    "if a level crossing occurs at a point @xmath202 then a level crossing must occur at the point @xmath1298 .",

    "by contrast , dualities are _ model specific transformations _ that always preserve locality ( in the hamiltonians ) , and are designed to take the most advantage of each model s peculiarities . to see how transmutation of statistics is possible , notice for example that bond algebras of fermionic systems feature only ( sums of ) _ even products _ of the elementary fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "since such even products behave very differently from the fermions themselves , they could in principle be mimicked by bonds of models featuring other types of elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "it follows from the formalism of section [ sec3.5 ] , in the absence of gauge symmetries , that the _ dual variables _ that arise from a _ duality connecting models with different statistics _ will afford a dictionary mediating the two statistics .",
    "dualities can also help improve the efficiency of standard fermionization techniques in dimension @xmath885 , because different dual representations of one and the same model can behave very differently under generalized jordan - wigner transformations .",

    "the jordan - wigner dictionaries arise as dual variable mappings .",
    "( ii ) we will then show that the generalization of a higher dimensional jordan - wigner transformation that maps nearest - neighbor bilinear interactions of different underlying statistics to one another is strictly impossible on lattices that have closed loops . in other words , there is no local fermionization mapping , that preserves the number of degrees of freedom , in dimensions @xmath1367 .",
    "there are , of course , four - body ( plaquette ) interactions where a local mapping is still possible .",
    "( iii ) finally , we will show that while mappings involving local nearest - neighbor bilinears , and preserving the number of degrees of freedom , are impossible , mappings involving gauge - reducing dualities are indeed possible .",
    "we illustrate this point by fermionizing the @xmath12 ising model via its duality to the @xmath0 ising gauge model .",
    "nonetheless , dualities that connect models with different statistics are constrained by quantum - mechanical considerations _ that depend on the space - time dimension @xmath1204 _ , and they become increasingly challenging as @xmath1204 increases .",
    "we will show an example of this in a family of models that can be fermionized in @xmath11 dimensions , but can not be fermionized in higher dimensions .",
    "we would like to mention that @xmath1368 , a process which not only effects exchange statistics transmutation to canonical bosons but also modifies the _ exclusion _ statistics @xcite , could also be in principle interpreted as a duality mapping but it is a less precisely defined mathematical transformation which requires some vacuum regularization process .      in this section",
    "we want to derive the standard jordan - wigner mapping as a duality transformation .",

    "we see that _ fermionization is a process local in the bonds _ , and that the non - local structure of the jordan - wigner transformation has the same origin as that of other dual variables .",
    "notice that one can define the inverse duality isomorphism @xmath1407 by inspection of equation , and express spin variables in terms of fermions @xmath1408 with the corresponding hermitian - conjugate relation .",
    "there is some flexibility in the definition of the jordan - wigner transformation that reflects two independent facts .",
    "first , we could have extended the bond algebra by adding the boundary bonds @xmath1409 ( and @xmath1410 ) , with the resulting string operator running from site @xmath1411 to site @xmath96 in equations and .",

    "we could have set @xmath1413 , where @xmath1414 , with the corresponding dual variables displaying this overall phase .",
    "moreover , one can extend these ideas to establish a duality - based derivation of generalized jordan - wigner transformations @xcite .",
    "we next ask whether nearest - neighbor spin and fermion models can be related on arbitrary lattices . on general lattices",
    "on which _ closed loops _ may be drawn , the bond algebras become richer and , in general , prohibit such a mapping between the simplest choice of elementary bonds involving two nearest - neighbor spins and two nearest - neighbor fermions .",
    "the natural extension of the mapping of equation reads @xmath1415 where the vectors @xmath1416 now label the endpoints of links on _ an arbitrary @xmath5-dimensional lattice_. as we will show below , equation generally fails to define a bond algebra isomorphism whenever the lattice contains at least two closed loops @xmath1417 that share a link . to see this ,",

    ", it follows from equations and that @xmath1427    this shows that the mapping of equation can not define a bond algebra isomorphism ( a fermionization of the xy model in @xmath885 ) , since it defines a many - to - one mapping .",
    "it is a good illustration of the type of problems that arise in attempts at fermionizing spin models in more than one dimension , while preserving locality @xcite and the dimension of the state space @xcite .",
    "thus , our circle of ideas has closed on itself .",
    "we see how a common ( and slightly imprecise ) lore , relating the existence of closed loops with the impossibility of transmutation of statistics in a direct physical way , is mathematically realized within the bond algebraic approach in the above case .",

    "_ different number of degrees of freedom_.      the result of the last section is a rigorous manifestation of a general obstruction to mapping nearest - neighbor spin hamiltonians to local fermionic models , and _ viceversa _ , in more than one spatial dimension @xcite , while preserving the dimension of the ( hilbert ) state space .",
    "there are some interesting exceptions , however , where the obstructions to higher dimensional fermionization have been overcome .",
    "these include the fermionization of ( i ) the poc model @xcite of section [ sec5.1 ] , ( ii ) the @xmath12 dimensional kitaev s honeycomb spin @xmath9 model @xcite ( and extensions thereof ) of section [ sec3.6 ] , and ( iii ) some general related models discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "a mapping between _ local _ fermionic models and local spin models is important in practice .",
    "some treatments @xcite invoke the need to add auxiliary fermions ( spins ) to map any local fermionic ( spin ) model to a _ sector of a local spin ( fermionic ) _ model , that acts in general on a larger state space .",
    "bond - algebraic dualities , that are always local transformations , afford practical alternative ( and more general ) approaches to the problem of fermionization in higher dimensions , that may or may not involve a change in the number of degrees of freedom . first there is the basic approach of looking directly for a bond - algebraic duality that connects the fermion / spin model of interest to a dual spin / fermion model , as we did at the beginning of this section . at times it is more convenient to look for a duality of the model of interest to a dual model that features the same type of degrees of freedom , but displays interaction terms that are amenable to standard fermion / spin or spin / fermion transformations . in either case , a change in the number of degrees of freedom may occur naturally as a consequence of a gauge - reducing duality .",
    "this affords a natural picture where local fermionization becomes possible , perhaps at the cost of introducing gauge symmetries .",
    "we next illustrate this idea in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "the quantum ising model in @xmath12 ( see equation ) has a large , flexible bond algebra generated by @xmath1429 this bond algebra contains the bonds of most other @xmath12 dimensional spin models of interest ( we already exploited this fact in section [ sec3.6 ] to find new dualities for the heisenberg model ) .",
    "it follows that if we can fermionize the ising model , we can translate that fermionization to many other spin models , including the heisenberg model , but it is well known that any attempt to rewrite it in terms of fermionic operators ( while preserving the dimension of the state space ) returns a _",
    "non - local _ fermionic hamiltonian ( this is to be expected in the light of the discussion of the previous section ) .",

    "let us close this section with two additional examples of fermionization .",

    "another new example is afforded by the xm model of section [ sec4.4 ] , that can be fermionized to read @xmath1435.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      two self - dual models known to any physicist , electromagnetism without sources and the quantum ising chain , happen to be integrable as well . since the presence of an exact self - duality is a rather unusual property in itself , one is naturally tempted to conjecture a connection between quantum integrability and self - duality .",
    "we have seen by now more than enough examples of self - dual models that are ( most likely ) _ not _ integrable to grant that the previous argument is without force .",
    "that is not , however , quite the end of the story .",
    "as it turns out , one of the few known criteria for quantum integrability , the dolan - grady relations @xcite , is somewhat connected to self - duality , in that those relations may in principle be more easily satisfied by self - dual models .",
    "in fact , of the very few ( all one - dimensional ) models known to satisfy these relations , the most relevant one is the quantum ising chain .",
    "closer scrutiny , however , seems to make very clear that the dolan - grady relations are essentially unrelated to self - duality .",
    "let us explain this more clearly .",
    "assume that a hamiltonian can be partitioned into two pieces @xmath436 and @xmath1436 , @xmath1437 such that @xmath436 and @xmath1436 satisfy the _ dolan - grady relations _",

    "it was shown in @xcite , in a remarkable _ tour - de - force _ , that the constraints alone suffice to guarantee that @xmath105 is a member of a family with an infinite number of conserved charges ( which can furthermore be explicitly written down in terms of @xmath436 and @xmath1436 ) .",
    "clearly , if @xmath105 is self - dual under an exchange of @xmath436 and @xmath1436 , so that @xmath1440 , then either dolan - grady relation implies the other .    in this sense , relations may be in principle more easily satisfied by self - dual models .",
    "but other than that , there is no reason to believe that self - duality is related to quantum integrability in any deeper way .",
    "first and foremost , the infinite set of conserved charges exist whenever holds , independently of the presence or absence of self - duality @xcite .",
    "moreover , a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators ( @xmath11 phonons ) afford an example of a model which is both exactly solvable and self - dual , and yet it does not satisfy neither relation in , which shows that the latter do not constitute a necessary condition for integrability either .",
    "it is important to notice also that the ising chain has _ two _ finite , self - dual renditions , @xmath1441 _ but only the latter satisfies the dolan - grady relations_.    it seems safe to conclude that self - duality and quantum integrability are quite independent properties , a fact that highlights once again the importance of self - dualities as non - perturbative probes of strongly - coupled models .      in recent years",
    "there has been much interest in topological quantum order @xcite . in topologically ordered systems ,",
    "the state of the system can not be characterized by local measurements but rather by topological quantities @xcite .",
    "one of the main hopes further driving interest in those systems has been that systems characterized by non - local order will be immune to local perturbations and thus quantum information may be protected for sufficiently long times .",
    "one of the most important properties of low temperature topological quantum order is indeed its robustness to local perturbations @xcite . as demonstrated in @xcite , several models harboring that order reduce , _ via a bond algebraic duality _ , to one - dimensional ising chains with short - range interaction .",
    "this suggested the possibility of short autocorrelation times in these particular models , and several new ones that have been devised and investigated since .",
    "one of the consequences of this dimensional reduction borne by bond - algebraic dualities is that these systems possess memory times that are finite ( i.e. , system size independent ) at all temperatures .",
    "this is so as the memory times @xmath1179 gleaned from ( time @xmath421 ) autocorrelation functions such as @xmath1442 with @xmath1443 a quantum bit ( qubit ) operator are reduced , via a bond algebraic duality , to the autocorrelation function of a local quantity in a lower dimensional system .",
    "as the dual lower dimensional system remains ergodic at all non - zero temperatures ( and thus harbors a finite autocorrelation time ) , the memory time in the higher dimensional topologically ordered system always remains finite as well .",

    "the dual lattice @xmath49 is obtained by placing a vertex at the center of each @xmath1204-dimensional volume , and connecting any two dual vertices that share an @xmath1524-dimensional face with a link piercing that face .",
    "similarly , the construction of the dual lattice assigns to each @xmath1525-dimensional simplex in the initial lattice one , and only one , @xmath1526-dimensional face in the dual lattice , and so on .",
    "hence a lattice duality maps @xmath1527-dimensional elementary simplices of the lattice to @xmath1528-dimensional simplices of its dual , in such a way that whenever two @xmath1527-dimensional simplices share an @xmath1529-dimensional face , the corresponding @xmath1528-dimensional dual simplices are connected by an @xmath1530-dimensional simplex of the dual lattice that _ pierces _ that connecting @xmath1531-dimensional simplex ( face ) . for example , a @xmath26 triangular lattice is dual to an hexagonal lattice , and a square lattice is dual to itself ( i.e. , it is _ self - dual _ ) .",
    "it is well known , though not necessarily obvious , that a lattice duality transformation is its own inverse .",
    "that is , the lattice @xmath49 dual to a lattice @xmath1532 , which is itself a dual lattice , is just the original lattice @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath1533 .",
    "in this appendix we analyze general conditions any two physical systems must satisfy in order to share identical energy spectra .    it is a basic postulate of quantum mechanics that observables should be represented by hermitian operators @xcite .",
    "hermiticity guarantees that observables always admit an spectral decomposition , and , in particular , if the spectral decomposition of a hamiltonian is known , @xmath1534 where @xmath1535 is the projector onto the hilbert space sector of energy @xmath1536 . then both the thermodynamics and quantum dynamics it determines are known as well .",
    "this follows because thermodynamic quantities can be computed from the ( canonical ) partition function @xmath1537 where @xmath1538 is the density of states at energy @xmath1536 ; and the dynamics of any observable is determined by heisenberg s equation of motion , @xmath1539,\\ ] ] that can be solved explicitly as @xmath1540    suppose now that the hamiltonian @xmath105 is defined on a hilbert space @xmath1541 of finite dimension @xmath1542 .",

    "it follows that two hamiltonians @xmath57 , @xmath58 can have identical energy levels only if @xmath1549 from an algebraic perspective , one can argue that energy levels are determined by the algebra @xmath1550 generated by @xmath105 and @xmath113 ( see reference @xcite , theorem 3.30 , for a precise statement of this idea ) .",
    "next we review well known relations concerning the one - to - one correspondence between the density of states @xmath1551 and the partition function @xmath1552 .",
    "equation ( [ zr ] ) expresses the partition function @xmath1552 as a laplace transform of the density of states @xmath1551 .",

    "( if both hamiltonians act on hilbert spaces of the same dimensionality @xmath1559 then , from equation ( [ spec_eq ] ) , it will suffice to verify equation for @xmath1560 ) .",
    "we review the basics of lattice quantum field theory ( lqft ) @xcite to clarify the connection between the lattice models studied in this paper and qft .",
    "lqft regularizes field theories by approximating fields taking values in the continuum space - time @xmath1561 ( @xmath1562 is the time axis ) with fields defined on a hyper - cubic space lattice of spacing @xmath883 , i.e. , @xmath1563 with @xmath1564 an integer .",

    "the lattice action @xmath1570 describes a mechanical model that can be quantized according to well understood schemes of quantization .",
    "the resulting quantum theory , known as lattice hamiltonian approach , represents a lattice approximation to the qft .",

    "the corresponding classical lattice field theory @xmath1573 where we have parametrized the field as @xmath1574 , describes a set of planar rigid rotators that has to be quantized according to dirac s quantization scheme @xcite .",

    "the resulting formalism discretizes both space and time _ , recasting quantum field theoretic problems in the language of classical statistical mechanics , and is ideally suited for numerical simulations .",
    "we describe it next .",
    "let us start with the simple case of a single particle in an external potential @xmath1577 .",
    "consider feynman s expression for transition amplitudes ( feynman s path integral @xcite ) , @xmath1578 where @xmath1579 , @xmath1580 , @xmath1581 , and @xmath1582 the hamiltonian operator of a particle moving in one dimension .",
    "equation reduces the evaluation of transition amplitudes to the evaluation of a multiple integral , by means of an approximation that _ discretizes time _",
    "( notice for future reference , that the argument of the exponential is the ( discrete form of the ) classical action of the particle ) .",
    "our goal , however , is to use feynman s formula to study ground state properties .",
    "so consider the quantum partition function @xmath1552 of equation .",
    "we can expect that at very low temperatures @xmath1552 will be dominated by the ground energy level , @xmath1583 or more precisely , @xmath1584    on the other hand , the partition function corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath1585 where now @xmath1586 , and the last integral expression can be interpreted as a _ classical _ partition function for @xmath96 oscillators .",
    "let us apply these ideas to a bosonic scalar field @xmath861 in @xmath26 dimensions , @xmath1587 that for special forms of @xmath1588 was studied in section [ sec6.1 ] .",
    "we start by discretizing the model in space and quantize it canonically .",
    "we then apply the formulas just derived for one particle @xmath1589 from which we can compute , for instance , quantum ground state properties ( @xmath1590 , where @xmath809 is the length in the space direction ) .",
    "it is standard practice to fine - tune the spacing in the `` time '' direction @xmath1591 equal to the lattice spacing @xmath883 , _ so that @xmath1592_. then we can write @xmath1593 where now @xmath1594 includes the `` time '' coordinate .",
    "another important example is that of gauge fields .",
    "the problem of finding a convenient discretization for the yang - mills action @xmath1595 was solved by wilson @xcite .",
    "wilson s action reads @xmath1596 where the @xmath358s , defined on the links of the lattice , are elements of the gauge group ( assumed for simplicity to be some unitary or special unitary group of dimension @xmath96 ) , and @xmath1597 stands for the _ real part_. if we take the gauge group to be @xmath6 @xmath1598 and wilson s action reads @xmath1599 which is the standard action for _ compact _ qed .",
    "notice that if one expands the cosine to lowest order one obtains @xmath1600 which is the standard discretization of maxwell s qed action .    in closing ,",
    "let us notice that the quantum hamiltonian for a lattice field theory can be recovered in principle from @xmath1601 , by using the transfer matrix formalism , see section [ classical&quantum ] .",
    "from a practical point of view , our approach to dualities is specially attractive because it permits to study dualities and self - dualities in _ finite - size systems _ , both classical and quantum . in this appendix",
    ", we illustrate through example the power of the bond - algebraic approach .",
    "one can simply check the duality mapping in a finite system and then safely extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the role boundary terms play in determining bulk properties is marginal .",
    "let us start with the ising model .",
    "we would like to study both open and periodic bcs , so we need at least three spins .",
    "then we have the hamiltonian @xmath1602 with open bcs , that is _ not _ self - dual ( its energy levels are not symmetric in @xmath422 and @xmath485 ) , and commutes with @xmath1603 . to restore self - duality , we can either _ remove _ , @xmath1604 or _ add _ @xmath1605 a bond ( see figure [ shorty_ising ] ) .",

    "the picture is quite different if we consider _ periodic _ bcs @xmath1606 again , the model is _ not _ self - dual , but it is @xmath0-symmetric and translationally invariant .",
    "remarkably , we can restore self - duality just by  decorating \" a bond , preserving all the symmetries of the model @xmath1607 this hamiltonian is local in terms of fermionic degrees of freedom ( i.e. , after a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite ) and its spectrum is self - dual .",
    "the bonds of the @xmath1608-symmetric heisenberg model @xmath1609 can be written in terms of the bonds of the self - dual ising model of equation .",
    "hence we can use the ising model self - duality mapping to generate a duality for the heisenberg model .",
    "the dual hamiltonian reads @xmath1610 and a simple calculation confirms that it shares the energy levels of @xmath226 .",
    "notice though that the non - abelian symmetry of @xmath226 is hidden in @xmath231 .",
    "next we consider gauge - reducing dualities as described in section [ sec3.12 ] .",
    "dualities that eliminate gauge symmetries connect models with state spaces of different dimensions , and so the unitaries @xmath509 that represent them are projective , meaning that they either map a state to another state with the same norm , or to zero . in other words , unlike symmetries and ordinary dualities that are represented by square matrices , gauge - reducing dualities are represented by _",
    "rectangular _ matrices .",
    "let us consider an elementary example , the @xmath12-dimensional @xmath0 gauge model of section [ sec3.12 ] restricted to just _ two _ lattice sites , @xmath1611 so that the model features just one gauge symmetry , @xmath1612 . as discussed in section [ sec3.12 ] , gauge symmetries are actually _ constraints_. the state space of @xmath1613 above has dimension , @xmath1614 , but contains states that are not physical , because they are not invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath1469 .    the fact that the state space of a gauge model contains non - physical states has an impact on its _ energy levels_. in general , three things could happen to any specific level : i ) its energy eigenstates are all gauge - invariant and so physical ; ii ) some eigenstates are gauge - invariant and some are not , so that the gauge constraints reduce the level s degeneracy ; iii ) _ none _ of its energy eigenstates are gauge - invariant , and so the energy level is not physical ( not realizable in experiments ) .",

    "@xmath1613 in particular shows a combination of i ) and iii ) , as one can check explicitly . on the other hand , it is more convenient to use dualities to solve the gauge constraints .",
    "the point is that we can find a different representation of the bond algebra of @xmath1613 that affords a dual hamiltonian @xmath1615 that captures only the gauge - invariant physics of @xmath1613 .",
    "since there is only one gauge symmetry , the space of gauge invariant states has dimension @xmath1616 , so that we should be looking for a duality to a model with a two - dimensional state space . with this in mind",
    ", we find right away @xmath1617 so that @xmath1618 , and the dual hamiltonian reads @xmath1619 it is easy to check that @xmath1613 displays four non - degenerate energy levels , two of them identical to the two levels of @xmath1615 .",
    "it follows ( and this can be checked explicitly ) that the energy eigenstates of @xmath1613 that belong to the levels not present in @xmath1615 are not gauge - invariant .",
    "the projective unitary that implements the mapping of equation is a @xmath1620 matrix that can be constructed as follows .",
    "the bond @xmath348 and the symmetry @xmath1621 taken together form a complete commuting set , with simultaneous eigenstates @xmath1622 on the other hand , @xmath348 is itself dual to a complete commuting set for the target space , @xmath1623 .",
    "thus @xmath509 must map the @xmath1624 eigenstates of @xmath348 to the corresponding @xmath1624 eigenstates of @xmath278 , and simultaneously map the @xmath1625 eigenstates of @xmath1621 to the zero vector (",
    "this is so because @xmath1621 must act as the identity in the space of the dual model , and the identity has only the eigenvalue @xmath463 ) .",

    "all four gauge symmetries of equation are independent .",
    "hence the space of gauge invariant states has dimension @xmath1639 .",
    "this means that the dual model without gauge symmetries must feature only four spins .",

    "one can check explicitly that every energy level of @xmath1643 is also present in the spectrum of @xmath1644 , but @xmath1644 has other levels in addition to the physical , gauge - invariant , ones .",
