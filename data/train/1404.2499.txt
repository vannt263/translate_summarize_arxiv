    "graphene is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) allotrope of carbon with excellent electronic and mechanical properties , making it suitable for multiple applications in nanoscale electronics and nanophotonics.@xcite a major deficiency in graphene s properties is the absence of a band gap rendering it impossible for use in switching circuits.@xcite several approaches have been used to induce a band gap in graphene such as electrically gated bilayer graphene,@xcite substrate induced band gap,@xcite or isoelectronic codoping with boron and nitrogen.@xcite recently , it has become possible to engineer the band gap of graphene by lithographic patterning into small quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) nano sheets referred to as graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs)@xcite with excellent electronic properties such as room temperature ballistic transport.@xcite the ability to produce gnrs in very large amount is helping to accelerate research in the field of gnr electronics . as quasi 1d materials , gnrs are extremely sensitive to their surrounding conditions , which provides a route for manipulating their electronic properties .",
    "additionally , other factors such as finite size effect,@xcite edge effect,@xcite and the presence of strain@xcite could be used to effectively tune the electronic properties gnrs .",
    "while patterning graphene into gnrs helps to induce a band gap , it has been shown that the effective mass of gnrs is proportional to the band gap@xcite . in intrinsic semiconductors where carrier scattering by longitudinal acoustic phonons is the dominant scattering mechanism ,",
    "the mobility is inversely proportional to the effective mass@xcite .",
    "this means increasing the band gap of gnrs results in an increase in effective mass and a decrease in mobility@xcite .",
    "it is therefore extremely important to perform a comprehensive study on the influence of edge passivation and external strain on carrier effective mass and its correlation with the energy band gap .",
    "the combined effects of edge passivation and strain on band gap for gnrs has been extensively studied using first principle calculations@xcite . in ref .",
    "23 , the authors focused only on modulation of band gap due to edge effects and strain . in ref .",
    "26 , it is shown that the effective mass of agnrs is proportional to the band gap , but the authors did not take into account the bond length variation induced by h - passivation .    in this work",
    ", we present a simple model which combines tb approximation with parameters derived from first principle calculations for studying the influence of edge passivation and uniaxial strain in the -16% to 16% range on the effective mass of agnrs .",

    "the effective mass dependence on band gap is parabolic and analytic fits were derived for agnrs belonging to different families .",
    "both band gap and effective mass exhibit a nearly periodic zigzag variation under strain , indicating that the effective mass remains proportional to the band gap even when strain is applied .",

    ", @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath7 is the longitudinal elastic constant , @xmath8 the effective mass , and @xmath9 the deformation potential constant reflecting the change in band edge induced by strain .",
    "while patterning graphene into nanoribbons and the application of external strain could be employed to induce and manipulate the band gap of graphene , the effective mass of gnrs has been shown to vary proportionately with the band gap for perfectly terminating agnrs@xcite , accounting for the diminishing mobility with increasing band gap in graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors@xcite .",
    "it is therefore extremely important to perform a comprehensive study on the influence of edge passivation and external strain on carrier effective mass and its correlation with the energy band gap in gnrs .",
    "we consider an agnr of width @xmath10 and translation period @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of dimer lines and @xmath13 the unstrained carbon to carbon ( c - c ) bond length at the center of the gnr ( see fig .",
    "[ agnr structure](a ) ) .",
    "since the width of an agnr is specified by the number of dimer lines along the ribbon , we will use the notation n - agnr to refer to an agnr with n dimer lines along the ribbon .",
    "the unit cell of an n - agnr contains @xmath12 a - type atoms and @xmath12 b - type atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ agnr structure ] .",
    "additionally , n - agnrs can be classified into three distinct families @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a positive integer and their electronic properties are known to exhibit distinct family splitting.@xcite the dangling @xmath16-bonds at the edges are passivated by h atoms ( or other atoms / groups like o and oh ) .",
    "edge passivation by foreign atoms or groups produces geometric deformation altering the c - c bonds and bonding angles at the nanoribbon edge .",
    "@xcite for example , for agnrs passivated with h atoms , the bond lengths parallel to dimer lines at edges are shortened by about 3.5%,@xcite compared to those in the middle of the ribbon . in general , this kind of geometric deformation results in changes of the hopping parameter@xcite between two neighboring carbon atoms and onsite energies on the gnr edge . in fig",
    ". [ agnr structure ] ( b ) , we show the h - passivated agnr under uniaxial strain . in the presence of uniaxial strain ,",
    "the translational period becomes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bond length for agnr under strain .",
    "hence , the strain ( @xmath16 ) can be defined as @xmath19 .",
    "a positive value for @xmath16 corresponds to tensile strain while a negative value represents compressive strain .",
    "since edge passivation and the presence of strain both alter the c - c bond length , these two effects can be described within the same model by simply incorporating the changes in onsite energies and hopping integrals induced by these effects",
    ". we shall discuss these effects using the tb model in what follows .",
    "the electronic states of gnrs are expressed in terms of the axial momentum ( @xmath20 ) and the lateral momentum ( @xmath21 ) , where @xmath22 in an integer describing the quantization of the component of electron s momentum along the width of the ribbon .",
    "agnrs are semiconductors with a direct band gap at the @xmath0 point . at @xmath23 ,",
    "the tb hamiltonian for an agnr reduces to a two - leg ladder lattice system @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ agnr structure ] ( c ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this simpler model reduces to @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote a site , @xmath26 site energies , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the nearest neighbor hopping integrals within each leg and between the legs respectively , and @xmath29 the annihilation operator of @xmath30-electrons on the @xmath31-th site of the @xmath32-th leg .",
    "we remark here that in this model , the electronic properties of gnrs are sensitive only to the three parameters : the site energies @xmath26 , and the nearest neighbor hopping integrals @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these parameters will differ for perfectly terminating , edge passivated and strained gnrs .",
    "this means that the combined effects of edge passivation and strain can be described by the same model hamiltonian by modifying the tb parameters in order to account for the considerable changes in c - c bond lengths .",
    "thus , the model is very simple and computational very efficient . in general for @xmath33 , @xmath34 can be expressed in matrix form for the translationally invariant system .",
    "if we order the basis as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , then the nearest neighbor hamiltonian can be split into four @xmath46 blocks @xmath47 where @xmath48 here , @xmath49 , with @xmath6 being the lattice constant .",
    "the electronic band structure of the agnr can then be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 corresponds to the conduction ( valence ) band , and @xmath22 the band index .",
    "the coefficients @xmath52 are tb wave function amplitudes .",
    "edge passivation and the effect of strain can both be described within our model by modifying the onsite energies and hopping integrals .",
    "strains applied to the gnr and the absorption of atoms or molecules at the edges causes an increase or decrease in c - c bond lengths , which in turn alters the onsite energies and the hopping integrals .",
    "previous studies carried out for edge passivated gnrs have shown that to first - order , the change in onsite energy due to edge passivation does not alter the band gap.@xcite we will therefore assume that changes in onsite energies due to h - passivation and uniaxial strain are negligible .",
    "hence we shall set all the onsite energies at @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in our treatment , we then focus only on changes in the hopping integrals due to external perturbations .",
    "a decrease in c - c bond length will increase overlap of @xmath30 orbitals which leads to an increase in the hopping integral .",
    "likewise , an increase in bond length will result to a decrease in @xmath30 orbital overlap , which accordingly decreases the hopping integral .",
