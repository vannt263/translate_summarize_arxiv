    "at the same time , some works indicate that rg expansion inhibits star formation by expelling ( and heating ) the igm gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a key step to quantify the large scale impact rgs have is to address the question that how much of the volume of the universe do the cosmological population of radio cocoons occupy over the hubble time , which we seek to answer in the present work .    from rough calculations",
    ", @xcite argued that the expanding lobes of the generations of rgs can pervade up to 0.5 of the whim ( warm / hot intergalactic medium ) component in the universe over @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite performed monte carlo simulations to construct virtual radio surveys @xcite , and @xcite estimated the cumulative volume filling factor to be @xmath4 .",
    "these results were expressed as a fraction of the whim volume , adopted from the numerical simulations of @xcite .    in this work",
    "we perform self - consistent cosmological simulations to compute the fractional volume of the universe occupied by rgs , a more rigorous approach than previous attempts . finding such volume filling fractions is important to probe in more detail the cosmological impact of rgs .",

    "the simulation method and model are described in  [ sec - model ] , and the results and discussion are in  [ sec - results ] .",
    "we perform n - body simulations of a @xmath0cdm universe , where a cubic cosmological box with comoving size @xmath5 mpc on a side , having triply periodic boundary conditions and expanding with the hubble flow , is evolved from @xmath6=25 up to @xmath6=0 .",

    "we implement 3 different values of @xmath60 : 10 myr produces 312340 sources , 100 myr produces 49282 sources , and 500 myr produces 12807 sources .",
    "we also consider the possibility that the rg lifetime is inversely proportional to the jet power , @xmath64 @xcite , where the constant is found assuming a lifetime of 500 myr at @xmath65 erg / s .",
    "this variable @xmath60 case produced 47179 sources .    at each timestep of the simulation",
    ", we spatially locate the new rgs born during that epoch ( whose @xmath62 values fall within the timestep interval ) in the high - density regions of the cosmological volume .",
    "we filter the density inside the box such that the rgs are spatially located in regions which would collapse to form halos of mass @xmath66 .",
    "we consider the mesh cells that have a filtered density @xmath67 the mean density of the box , and each new rg is located at the center of one such dense cell , selected randomly .",
    "after being born , a rg evolves through an active - agn phase (  [ sec - active - agn ] , when @xmath68 ) , and then goes through a post - agn phase (  [ sec - dead - agn ] , when @xmath69 ) . at each timestep",
    "the total volume occupied by the rgs is computed by counting the contributions of all the sources born by then , both the active ones and those in the post - agn phase .",

    "according to the standard scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cocoon pressure @xmath71 is much larger than the ambient gas pressure .",
    "the advance speed @xmath72 of the jet head is obtained by balancing the jet momentum flux with the ram pressure of the ambient medium , @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the area of the shocked `` working '' surface at the end of the cocoon ( larger than the instantaneous cross section area of the jet ) and @xmath75 is the external density .",
    "we use @xmath76 assuming that the shock front has a constant half - opening angle of @xmath77 relative to the central agn @xcite .",
    "since @xmath60 is short compared to the hubble time , energy losses and hubble expansion are neglected in this phase . all the kinetic energy transported along the jets during a rg s age @xmath78",
    "is transferred to the cocoon , whose energy is @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",

    "a shock is driven sideways into the ambient medium at a speed @xmath82 , following @xmath83 .",
    "the rg expands self - similarly during this phase @xcite and we approximate it s shape as cylindrical with length @xmath84 and radius @xmath85 .",
    "the two equations of motion are : @xmath86 for advance along the jet , and @xmath87 perpendicular to the jet .",
    "we solve for @xmath70 and @xmath88 using a 4th - order runge - kutta integration method .",
    "the rg volume during this self - similar expansion is then @xmath89 .",

    "it then becomes spherical in shape , and the sedov - taylor blast wave model describing the adiabatic expansion of a hot plasma sphere into a cold medium can be used to obtain its radius @xcite , @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93 by averaging the gas density of the mesh cells in the simulation box occurring within the cocoon spherical volume . for a strong explosion in the @xmath94 ambient gas , @xmath95 \\}^{1/5 }",

    "then the rg volume is @xmath96 .",
    "when the agn activity ends , the cocoon self - similarity is lost and we consider that the rg attains a spherical shape , if it had already not done so in the active phase .",
    "the pressure inside the cocoon causes the rg to continue expanding as long as it is overpressured @xcite .",
    "this overpressured cocoon expansion occurs analogous to a spherical adiabatic stellar wind bubble , with the radius evolving as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - rc ] ) . here",
    "the total kinetic energy injected into the cocoon by the agn throughout the active rg lifetime is @xmath97 .",
    "the rg is considered to undergo adiabatic expansion losses , and the cocoon pressure evolves as @xmath98 constant , with the constant derived from the pressure and size it had at the end of the active phase .",
    "the rg follows a spherical expansion as long as its pressure exceeds the external pressure , i.e. , @xmath99 , and in this late expansion phase , @xmath100 .",
    "when @xmath101 , or , the cocoon has reached pressure equilibrium with the external medium , the rg has no further intrinsic expansion .",
    "after this point , the cocoon simply evolves passively with the hubble flow of the cosmological volume .",
    "thus a rg in pressure equilibrium attains a final volume of @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the final comoving radius of the cocoon .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the redshift evolution of two single rgs in the simulation ; here we discuss only the one with @xmath104 myr ( _ red _ curves ) . at the end of the active phase ( @xmath105 ) its cocoon",
    "is overpressured by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "so it continues to expand while its pressure falls faster because of adiabatic losses .",
    "finally when @xmath71 falls to a level to match the external pressure it does not expand anymore . from @xmath107",
    "its comoving radius remains constant at @xmath108 mpc in the passive hubble phase .",
    "this illustrates that the radio cocoons are persistently overpressured for a substantial period of time even after the agn has stopped activity , and hence continue to expand into the ambient medium . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , after a active life of @xmath109 myr , the rg remains overpressured for @xmath110 myr .",
    "such results are in accord with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our simulations @xmath111 ( depending on the active lifetime ) of",
    "the sources became spherical in shape during the active - agn phase . in order to prevent overcounting of the volume due to overlap of rgs",
    ", we count the mesh cells in the simulation box which occur inside the volume of one or more rg cocoons",
    ". the total number of these filled cells , @xmath112 , give the total volume of the box occupied by rgs .",
    "we express the total volume filled as a fraction of volumes of various overdensities in the box , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the mean matter density of a spatially flat universe ( the box ) at an epoch @xmath6 .",
    "so @xmath115 gives the number of cells which are at a density @xmath116 times the mean density .",
    "we find @xmath115 for @xmath117 ; @xmath118 gives the total volume of the box , since then @xmath119 is the total number of cells in the box .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the redshift evolution of the volume filling factors for different active lifetimes . by the present epoch , @xmath120 of the entire universe",
    "is filled by rgs of active lifetime @xmath121 myr , the fraction going up to @xmath122 for 100 myr , and @xmath123 for 500 myr . with @xmath104 or @xmath124 myr ,",
    "rgs fill up all of the the overdense regions ( @xmath125 , or higher ) by @xmath126 . with @xmath127 myr ,",
    "rgs always fill up regions with @xmath128 or higher at all epochs . the case with @xmath64 fills up @xmath129 of the universe by @xmath130 , and give volume filling fractions similar to the values with a constant lifetime of 100 myr .",
    "it is the overdense cosmic regions which gravitationally collapse to form stars and galaxies .",
    "so evidently the rgs have a profound impact on the protogalactic regions of the universe . the precise effect on star formation",
    "is still open to debate (  [ sec - intro ] ) , with possible rg influence on both triggering and suppressing star formation in different regions of the universe depending on the exact ambient conditions .",
    "our volume filling factors of @xmath131 are between the values that @xcite ( @xmath132 ) and @xcite ( @xmath133 ) obtained as a fraction of the volume of the whim component of the universe .",
    "our results , based on self - consistent cosmological simulations , give a more reliable estimate of the fractional volume of the universe occupied by rgs .",
    "the volumes obtained by @xcite ( 100% filling by @xmath134 ) are much higher , since they consider the whole agn population .",
    "we perform preliminary estimates of the energy density and magnetic field in the volumes of the universe filled by radio cocoons .",
    "the cocoon energy density behaves similar to the cocoon pressure evolving adiabatically (  [ sec - dead - agn ] ) @xmath135 .",
    "assuming equipartition of energy between magnetic field of strength @xmath136 and relativistic particles inside the cocoon , the magnetic energy density is @xmath137 .",
    "the mean thermal energy density of the ambient medium inside the rg volume is @xmath138 .",
    "we define the volume weighted average of a physical quantity @xmath139 as @xmath140 , where the summation is over all rgs existing in the simulation box at that epoch .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the redshift evolution of @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the energy densities and magnetic field decrease with redshift as the filled volumes get bigger .",
    "the ratio @xmath142 , giving the importance of cocoon magnetic energy over external thermal energy , has a trend similar to that deduced by @xcite .",
    "we find that , by the present , @xmath144 is comparable to @xmath145 or greater by factors of few , implying that substantial magnetic energies are infused into the igm by the expanding radio cocoons . at @xmath146 , a magnetic field of @xmath2 g permeates the filled volumes , consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite . at a given redshift ,",
    "the energy density and magnetic field are larger for higher source lifetimes . the results for @xmath64 are intermediate between those of 10 and 100 myr .",
    "we conclude that using our n - body cosmological simulations , the expanding population of rgs pervade @xmath131 of the volume of the universe by the present , and occupy @xmath147 of the overdense regions by @xmath148 .",
