    "in 1998 , the cdf collaboration observed the pseudoscalar bottom - charm @xmath0 mesons through the decay modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath3 collisions at the energy @xmath4 at the fermilab tevatron , the measured mass is @xmath5 @xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "the cdf collaboration observed the pseudoscalar @xmath0 mesons with a significance exceeds @xmath6 through the decay modes @xmath7 in @xmath3 collisions at the energy @xmath8 using the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ii ) , the measured mass is @xmath9 @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "the d0 collaboration reconstructed the @xmath7 decays and observed the pseudoscalar @xmath0 mesons with a significance more than @xmath10 , the measured mass is @xmath11 @xcite . now",
    "the average value listed in the review of particle physics is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "other @xmath0 mesons , such as the scalar , vector , axialvector , tensor @xmath0 mesons , have not been observed yet , but they are expected to be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the future @xcite .",
    "the heavy quarkonium states and triply - heavy baryon states play an important role both in studying the interplays between the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd and in understanding the heavy quark dynamics due to the absence of the light quark contaminations .",
    "the bottom - charm quarkonium states @xmath0 , which consist of the heavy quarks with different flavors , are of special interesting .",
    "the ground states and the excited states lying below the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 thresholds can not annihilate into gluons , and therefore are more stable than the corresponding charmonium and bottomonium states , and would have widths less than a hundred @xmath17 @xcite . the excited states can undergo radiative or hadronic transitions to the ground state pseudoscalar @xmath0 mesons , which decay weakly . there have been several theoretical works on the mass spectroscopy of the @xmath0 mesons , such as the relativized ( or relativistic ) quark model with an special phenomenological potential @xcite , the nonrelativistic quark model with an special phenomenological potential @xcite , the semi - relativistic quark model using the shifted large-@xmath18 expansion @xcite , the perturbative qcd @xcite , the nonrelativistic renormalization group @xcite , the lattice qcd @xcite , etc .",
    "the qcd sum rules is a powerful theoretical tool in studying the heavy quarkonium states @xcite , and the existing works focus on the @xmath19-wave heavy quarkonium states @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the @xmath24-wave spin - triplet heavy quarkonium states @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath0 mesons have been studied by the full qcd sum rules @xcite and the potential approach combined with the qcd sum rules @xcite , while the vector @xmath0 mesons ( @xmath28 ) have been studied by the full qcd sum rules @xcite , and the axialvector @xmath0 mesons have not been studied yet . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "colangelo , nardulli and paver took the leading - order approximation , obtained the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and did not present the value @xmath31 . in ref.@xcite , narison took into account the next - to - leading - order perturbative contributions by assuming that one quark had zero mass , and obtained the values @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the predicted mass @xmath35 is much larger than other theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "those studies based on the qcd sum rules were preformed before the pseudoscalar @xmath0 mesons were observed by the cdf collaboration , the predictions should be updated .",
    "now we can take the experimental data as guides to choose the suitable borel parameters and continuum threshold parameters .",
    "naively , we expect that the masses of the pseudoscalar , vector and axialvector @xmath0 mesons have the hierarchy : @xmath36 , the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the spin - parity @xmath40 .",

    "the decay constants are basic input parameters in studying the exclusive processes of the @xmath0 mesons with the three - point vacuum correlation functions .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the masses and decay constants of the vector and axialvector @xmath0 mesons in sect.2 ; in sect.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sect.4 is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation functions @xmath42 in the qcd sum rules , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , the vector and axialvector currents @xmath45 and @xmath46 interpolate the vector and axialvector @xmath0 mesons , respectively .    we can insert a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath47 into the correlation functions @xmath42 to obtain the hadronic representation @xcite . after isolating the ground state contributions come from the vector and axialvector @xmath0 mesons , we get the following result , @xmath48 where the decay constants @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 and the @xmath51 are the polarization vectors of the vector and axialvector @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we can use dispersion relation to express the hadronic ( or phenomenological ) representation of the correlation functions @xmath52 in the following form , @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are the continuum threshold parameters .",
    "now , we briefly outline the operator product expansion for the correlation functions @xmath42 .",

    "we have used the equation of motion , @xmath71 , and taken the approximation @xmath72 to obtain the contributions of the four - quark condensates .",
    "the contributions of the four - quark condensates are depressed by inverse powers of the large euclidean momentum @xmath73 ( thereafter the borel parameter @xmath74 ) and play minor important roles , we neglect other diagrams contribute to the four - quark condensates of the order @xmath75 .",
    "we also neglect the contributions come from the three gluon condensates , as they are also depressed by inverse powers of the large euclidean momentum @xmath73 .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the next - to - leading - order perturbative contributions are shown in fig.4 .",
