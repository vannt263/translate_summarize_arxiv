    "the production of dust in the ejecta of core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sne ) is supported by observations @xcite , while theoretical studies of dust condensation in primordial cc - sne have predicted that 0.10.3",
    "@xmath6of dust could be produced @xcite .",
    "evidence for dust formation by ( at least ) some sne comes from precise isotopic abundance ratio studies of grain inclusions found in meteorites , with many ( including graphite and silicon carbide inclusions ) exhibiting isotopic distributions that differ significantly from those found in the sun and earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , direct evidence that sne play a major role in the dust budget of galaxies is still sparse , since of the few supernovae that have been probed for dust production , most appear to have formed much less dust than predicted by models .",
    "for example , analyses of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of sne 1987a and 1999em from 400800 days after outburst yielded estimates of a few@xmath7 @xmath6of dust formed per sn @xcite , which translates into condensation efficiencies , defined here as ( mass of refractory elements condensed into dust)/(mass of refractory elements in ejecta ) , of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for sne to have produced the majority of the @xmath9@xmath10 @xmath6of dust found in high - redshift ( @xmath11 ) quasars @xcite , their condensation efficiency must have been around @xmath120.2 @xcite .    in the cases of both sne 1987a and 1999em , the above investigators all separately noted that the dust masses could be significantly larger if the dust was clumped rather than distributed homogeneously throughout the ejecta .",
    "the presence of clumped dust is supported by the wavelength - independent circumstellar extinction seen in some sne @xcite , and by the theoretical expectation that rayleigh - taylor instabilities should form in post - shock ejecta @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed this hypothesis for dust formation within sn  2003gd , by demonstrating with three - dimensional monte - carlo radiative transfer ( rt ) models that clumpy , inhomogeneous dust models can require up to an order of magnitude more mass , than implied by either analytic estimates or by homogeneous dust models , to produce a given optical extinction and mid - infrared ( ir ) excess .",
    "sugerman et al .",
    "found that clumped models implied that up to @xmath13 @xmath6of dust had formed in the ejecta of sn  2003gd by day 678 , corresponding to a dust condensation efficiency of up 0.12 , which is interestingly close to the efficiency of @xmath120.2 required to match high redshift dusty sources .    since the previous , rather low , dust mass estimates for sn  1987a were based on analytical techniques , we were therefore motivated to re - analyse the available observational data for this object using modelling techniques similar to those used by sugerman et al . for sn  2003gd .",
    "in addition to allowing for clumped dust distributions , we also study the effects that the geometry of the medium and the spatial distribution of the luminosity source have on the emerging spectral energy distributions ( sed ) and , as a consequence , on dust masses determined by fitting rt models to observations .",
    "radiative transfer in an inhomogeneous medium has been the subject of a number of studies , including the simplest approach of a two - phase medium consisting of dense clumps embedded in a less dense interclump medium ( icm ) .",
    "these studies employed a combination of analytical techniques and monte carlo modelling with dust models of varying complexity , in order to study dust in different phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and in protogalactic and galactic environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "all the models presented in this work were performed using the 3d monte carlo rt code mocassin @xcite , which can account for both ( primary and secondary ) components of the radiation field in a fully self - consistent manner through absorption , re - emission and scattering of photons .",
    "this is necessary if one wants to deal with the transfer through inhomogeneous clumpy distributions , both for the case of a diffuse illuminating source distributed through the medium or for the case of a central illuminating source .",
    "section  2 describes the basic assumptions used for the modelling , while the results of our parameter investigation are presented and discussed in section  3 . in section  4 ,",
    "we readdress the issue of the mass of dust formed by sn  1987a , constraining our models primarily with the observations between @xmath120.3@xmath14 m and 30@xmath14 m published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w93 ) .",
    "using both smoothly varying and clumped grain density distributions , the 3d monte carlo radiative transfer ( rt ) code mocassin @xcite was used by @xcite to derive the mass of dust condensed by the type  ii sn  2003gd , by fitting optical ( b , v , r , i ) and _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "3.6@xmath14 m , 4.5@xmath14 m , 5.8@xmath14 m , 8.0@xmath14 m , and 24@xmath14 m fluxes observed at two epochs ( days 499 and 678 after outburst ) .",
    "their results clearly showed that analytical analyses of optical and ir data , as well as rt models with smoothly varying dust density distributions , can underestimate the dust mass by an order of magnitude or more compared to models that allow for clumping .",
    "@xcite provided evidence that optically thick clumps may exist in the envelope of sn  1987a , implying that the dust mass may be underestimated by sed - based smooth density distribution models .",
    "these authors argued that amorphous part dust was required by the wavelength - dependent blueward shift of various emission lines , while clumps are required to explain the wavelength independent reddening effect of the dust .",
    "successively , w93 summarised the evidence for significant clumping in the ejecta of sn  1987a , which was provided by observations ranging from @xmath0-ray and x - ray to infrared wavelengths .",
    "we have therefore revisited the observational data for sn  1987a , employing a similar modelling strategy to that used for sn  2003gd , i.e.  we assume that dust condensed in clumps within the ejecta , with the heating source distributed within the remnant shell .",
    "our models are appropriate for type  ii sne older than a few hundred days , when the energy input is dominated by @xmath0-rays from @xmath1co decay ( * ? ? ?",
    "we consider two clumping models , designed to represent the extreme cases of likely clumping behaviour : ( i ) the diffuse heating source is mixed with the dust grains , which are present in both the clumps and in the interclump medium ( icm ) ; and ( ii ) the diffuse illumination source is confined to the virtually dust - free icm , with all dust grains confined to the clumps .",
    "the latter model appears the most physically plausible , given that the outer c , o , and si - rich shells , where carbonaceous and silicate grains are expected to form , should never completely mix with the inner @xmath1ni/@xmath1co zone @xcite .",
    "only macroscopic mixing has been found in the clumpy ejecta of the type  ii supernova remnant cas  a @xcite , suggesting that the element layers were not homogeneously mixed . for completeness",
    ", we also consider a `` smooth '' , clump - free model .",
    "@xcite reported early ir observations ( day 265 and 267 ) and found no evidence for any emission from dust that might have formed in the sn ejecta or from pre - existing dust in the surrounding medium .",
    "a variety of observations indicated that the onset of dust formation in the ejecta of sn  1987a occurred at about day 530 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* w93 ) . given that the featureless 10-@xmath14 m spectrum of sn  1987a after day  530 ( w93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) precludes a significant silicate contribution , the dust was assumed to be either amorphous carbon ( optical constants from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or graphite ( optical constants from * ? ? ?",
    "in view of theoretical predictions that supernova grain size distributions should be relatively lacking in large particles @xcite , we adopted a standard ( * ? ? ?",

    "we found however that for the models presented in section  3 , the seds predicted by considering a full mrn distribution versus a truncated size distribution are quite similar and that the choice of either did not affect the general results of this paper .",
    "following our parameter investigation , we determine best fits to the w93 day 615 and day 775 spectra for all three dust configurations ( smooth , clumpy i and clumpy ii ) and in section 4 present revised dust mass estimates for sn  1987a on days 615 and 775 .     model and the green - dashed line is for a model with @xmath19 . , width=321 ]                                              the 3d monte carlo photoionisation and dust rt code mocassin was described and benchmarked in @xcite .",
    "we used version 2.02.21 of the code in its dust - only rt mode , which allows a multi - grid resolution approach in order to increase the spatial resolution in the clumps .",
    "the radiation field is described by discrete monochromatic packets of energy @xcite , whose trajectories through the shell ( mapped on multiple cartesian grids ) are characterised by absorption , re - emission and scattering events , according to the local medium opacities and emissivities . to ensure that energy conservation is strictly enforced at each location ,",
    "all energy packets are followed until they escape the shell , contributing to the emergent sed .",
    "the initial frequencies of the energy packets , emitted in this case by an extended diffuse source , are determined by sampling the probability density functions ( pdf s ) obtained from the blackbody distribution for the temperature of the source .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity , @xmath20 , integrated over the diffuse source equals that of an equivalent centrally - located point source and the energy carried by each individual energy packet in unit time is simply @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total number of energy packets employed in the simulation .",
    "our models consist of a spherical shell , with inner radius @xmath23 , outer radius @xmath24 and a @xmath25 density profile .",
    "two basic dust density distributions are considered : one where the density varies smoothly as @xmath26 and the other with dense homogeneous clumps embedded in a less dense icm , with a density profile varying as @xmath26 .",
    "the clumps have radius @xmath27 and a volume filling factor , @xmath28 .",
    "the density contrast between the clumps and the icm is defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the clump and icm dust densities at the inner edge of the shell .",
    "the absolute dust density in the clumps is therefore constant for all clumps , regardless of their radial distance , meaning that the density contrast with the icm is larger at larger shell radii .",
    "our choice to employ this model is based upon the assumption that as early as a few hours after outburst , post - shock ejecta become rayleigh - taylor unstable @xcite , forming a clumpy distribution .",
    "the clumps would then simply move outward with the original imprint of density enhancement remaining intact .",
    "the clump positions are assigned stochastically , with the probability of a given grid cell being occupied by a clump being proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of clumps in a given model is controlled by the volume covering factor , @xmath28 , and the clump size parameter , which is kept constant at a value of @xmath32  =  @xmath33/30 .",
    "the smooth models use 61@xmath34 cells to describe the sn shell , although we make use of the assumed symmetrical nature of the object and restrict our simulations to only one eighth of the total volume , reflecting the packets at the cartesian planes @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : clumpy ] shows a 3d representation of the density distribution in the clumpy models , consisting of cross - sections taken along the positive domains of the orthogonal cartesian planes",
    ". the clumpy models also use a _ mother _ grid of 61@xmath34 cells to describe the icm , whilst each individual clump is described by a subgrid of 5@xmath34 cells which occupies the volume of a _ mother _ grid cell .",
    "we experimented with higher resolution grids and subgrids and found that they had negligible consequences on our final results .",
    "for clumpy model configurations i and ii we first vary the dominant clump parameters and show the effects of these variations on the emergent seds and equivalent optical depths , defined in section  [ sec : difil ] below .      the illuminating source is adopted to have a total bolometric luminosity @xmath35 at day 615 ( from figure  3 of w93 ) radiating as a blackbody of @xmath36  =  7000  k. we experimented with lower blackbody effective temperatures and came to the conclusion that the observations could be best fitted by a value of t@xmath37  =  7000  k , which may be interpreted as the superposition of the 5000 - 5500  k optically thick ` hot ' component and the h  i bound - free continuum component identified in the w93 fits to the sn  1987a observations ( their figure  2 ) .",
    "we also note that for the same epoch ( day 616 ) @xcite and @xcite found @xmath38 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "however in this work , we adopt the lower luminosity value which is consistent with and returns the better fit to w93 s data , as shown in figure  [ fig : ltest ] , where we compare the seds obtained by identical smooth density models of day 615 , but with different bolometric luminosity .",
    "the red - dotted line is for a model with @xmath35 model and the green - dashed line is for a model with @xmath19 .",
    "the input parameters for all models will be discussed in more details in the following sections .",
    "the diffuse source is distributed either throughout the medium , including in the clumps ( the clumpy i models , in which the diffuse heating source intensity follows the dust density ) ; or located only in the icm ( the clumpy ii models ) , such that each radiating cell @xmath39 emits a luminosity @xmath40 proportional to the local interclump medium density .    in the case of a sn shell illuminated by a diffuse source of radiation distributed within the shell , optical depths calculated along a line of sight from the centre of the sphere",
    "have little observational relevance . to account for the fact that the photons emitted from different locations within the shell will encounter very different opacities",
    ", we calculate the _ effective optical depth _",
    ", @xmath41 , from the ratio of the emerging unattenuated flux at @xmath42 for the case where there is no dust present , @xmath43 , to the emergent flux after attenuation by dust in the shell , @xmath44 : @xmath45 this method is completely independent of geometry and therefore does not require averaging along a discrete number of lines of sight ; furthermore it automatically takes into account the effects of photons scattering off the grains , which increases their path lengths through the shell , thus increasing the probability of their being absorbed by dust before escaping .",
    "in this section we present results obtained from clumpy models where both clumps and icm radiate with luminosity @xmath40 proportional to the local medium density .",
    "the effects of varying the volume filling factor of the clumps , @xmath28 , the clump - to - icm density ratio , @xmath46 , and the dust mass , @xmath47 on the emerging seds and effective optical depths of the models are illustrated in figures  [ fig : sedcef ] to  [ fig : sedcemass ] .",
    "the seds are plotted as dimensionless , distance- and luminosity - independent spectral shapes , or relative flux , @xmath48/@xmath49 , versus @xmath42 in microns ..",
    "figure  [ fig : sedcef ] shows that increasing the volume filling factor @xmath28 of the clumps has dramatic effects on the effective optical depth and therefore on the emergent seds , for models with @xmath46  =  100 and the same total dust mass @xmath50  =  5.6@xmath210@xmath51 , with the individual dust clumps each having a mass of 10@xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath28 = 0.05 , each of these clumps has a centre - to - edge radial optical depth in the r - band of 1.22 for the amorphous carbon models .",
    "the same clumps containing graphite grains @xcite , rather than amorphous carbon grains , would have a centre - to - edge radial optical depth in the r - band of 0.46 .",
    "it is clear that an increase of the clump volume filling factor causes a decrease in the effective optical depth of the models , with less optical radiation being reprocessed at ir wavelengths .",
    "this somewhat counter - intuitive effect is in fact a direct result of the luminosity source being embedded in the clumps , so for constant @xmath47 and @xmath46 , an increase in @xmath28 implies a decrease in the clump dust density and thus a reduction of the optical depth through each knot , facilitating the escape of photons emitted by a given knot .",
    "this is opposite to the behaviour of models which have a central source of radiation , or ones in which only the icm radiates , as described in the next section .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sedcealpha ] we show the seds ( left panels ) and the equivalent optical depths ( right panels ) for models with a constant @xmath28  =  0.05 and a total dust mass in all clumps of @xmath50  =  5.6@xmath210@xmath51 , for different values of @xmath46 .",
    "variations in @xmath46 do not appear to have large effects on the emerging seds , except perhaps for the @xmath46  =  1 model ( red - dotted line ) , where there is no dust density enhancement in the clumps with respect to the icm .",
    "we note , however , that the icm dust density follows an @xmath26 dependency , whereas the density of the clumps stays constant with distance from the centre , implying that the clump to icm density ratio increases as the square of the distance from the centre .",
    "the main point is that for a model where the intensity of the diffuse heating source follows the dust density , dust grains can not be hidden in optically thick clumps .",
    "an increase in dust mass , e.g. a factor of two , will change the optical and ir sed dramatically , as shown in figure  [ fig : sedcemass ] , where in the left- and right - hand panels we plot the emergent seds and equivalent optical depths for models where @xmath28 and @xmath46 stay constant at values of 0.1 and 100 , respectively , and the total dust mass @xmath47 varies from @xmath125@xmath210@xmath51 to @xmath121@xmath210@xmath53 .",
    "finally , it is clear that for these models a degeneracy exists between @xmath28 and total dust mass @xmath50 , which can not be resolved solely by sed observations .",
    "we now present the results obtained from clumpy models ii having exactly the same clump distribution as for i , but this time assuming that dust is only present in the clumps and that the luminosity source is only embedded in the icm .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 tends to infinity for these models , so we only investigate the effects of varying @xmath28 and @xmath47 on the emerging seds and equivalent optical depths .",
    "the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : sedcenef ] show the seds and equivalent optical depths corresponding to models with constant total dust mass @xmath47  =  3.5@xmath210@xmath51 and @xmath28  =  0.01 ( black , dotted ) , 0.02 ( red , dashed ) , 0.05 ( green , dash - dot ) and 0.1 ( blue , dash - dot - dot ) . the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : sedcenemd ] show the seds and equivalent optical depths corresponding to models with constant @xmath28  =  0.1 and @xmath47 between @xmath54 . for the reference model , with @xmath28  =  0.1 and and @xmath47  =  3.5@xmath210@xmath51 , each clump has a mass of 3.5@xmath210@xmath55 and a centre - to - edge radial optical depth in the v - band of 1.33 and 0.41 , for the amorphous carbon and graphite models , respectively .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : sedcenef ] that @xmath28 directly controls the effective optical extinction , i.e. the amount of radiation intercepted by the clumps and reprocessed at ir wavelengths .",
    "the behaviour of the seds and equivalent optical depths here is the same as for a centrally located source and opposite to that shown by the clumpy i models where the heating radiation is emitted within both clumps and icm .    in the current case of a dust - free icm with the dust confined to clumps , for optically thick clumps the equivalent optical depth in the visual region",
    "is governed only by the covering factor of the clumps , which determines the amount of radiation intercepted by the clumps .",
    "this would imply that the actual dust mass in the clumps would be unconstrained by the measured extinction in the optical and that virtually unlimited amounts of dust could be hidden in optically thick clumps .",
    "this is apparent in figure  [ fig : sedcenemd ] , where it can be seen that the models with 10 , 50 and 100@xmath56  3.5@xmath210@xmath51 show the same sed between @xmath120.3@xmath14 m and @xmath122@xmath14 m .",
    "however the quantity of dust in the clumps still has a significant effect on the grain temperature distribution and therefore on the appearance of the sed at ir wavelengths .",
    "the larger the dust mass for a given @xmath28 , the cooler the average grain temperature and therefore the greater the shift of the reprocessed radiation peak to longer wavelengths .",
    "so , for the clumpy ii case the total dust mass is not unconstrained , even when the clumps are optically thick .",
    "if both optical and ir observational data are available , it appears that the best modelling strategy for optically thick clumps , when segregation between the dust and the heating source is assumed , is ( i ) to start with a large dust mass ( enough for the clumps to be optically thick in the visual region ) and to vary @xmath28 until a fit is achieved for the optical part of the sed ; ( ii ) keeping @xmath28 fixed , to vary the dust mass until a fit to the ir part of the sed is also achieved .",
    "if the dust mass is reduced to the point where the optical sed starts changing again , this implies that the clumps are becoming optically thin",
    ". this may be acceptable , or one may try a lower covering factor and restart the fitting process .",

    "( 2004 ) detected mid - ir silicate emission from the circumstellar ring that is believed to have been produced by mass loss by the progenitor star of sn  1987a .",
    "this ring is responsible for most of the present - day mid - ir emission , but bouchet et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that this contribution started after day 4200 only , and therefore does not affect the present findings .",
    "we also made estimates for the circumstellar extinction in the envelope of sn  1987a at late epochs in order to constrain our models .",
    "for this we used the methods described in greater detail by @xcite for the case of sn  2003gd .",
    "using the photometric data of @xcite for days 1 - 813 and @xcite thereafter , we estimated the circumstellar r - band extinction of sn  1987a at days 615 and 775 by comparing the observed level of the light curve at those epochs to that expected for a light curve powered purely by the decay of @xmath1co that had been normalised to the photometric data obtained earlier than day 400 .",
    "this yielded @xmath57 s of 1.7 and 2.4 magnitudes at days 615 and 775 , respectively .",
    "a somewhat more conservative estimate of the circumstellar extinction can be obtained if we assume that the intrinsic light curve has contributions from other sources of decay , such as @xmath61co , and also allow for the decreasing opacity of the envelope to the gamma rays that power the light curve .",
    "this yielded @xmath57 s of 1.2 and 1.6 magnitudes at days 615 and 775 , respectively .",
    "corresponding estimates for the r - band circumstellar extinction produced by the models were obtained by comparing the r - band flux levels obtained with and without dust .",
    "inspection of table  1 ( final row for each model ) shows that all of our day 615 models satisfy the @xmath57 = 1.21.7 observational constraint . for the case of our day",
    "775 models the predicted @xmath57 range is 1.52.4 , which can be compared to our estimated observational constraint of @xmath57 = 1.62.4 .    ) of @xcite graphite compared to @xcite amorphous carbon and to @xcite astronomical silicate .",
    "the coefficients were computed using mie scattering routines using an mrn size distribution with minimum and maximum grain radii of 0.005 and 0.05 @xmath14 m , identical to that used in all models presented in this paper.,width=321 ]    for clumpy  i amorphous carbon or graphite models , the derived day 615 and day 775 dust masses are the same , while the inner radius for the day 775 models is 5.7/5.0 times larger than for day 615 . yet the day 775 models yield higher @xmath57 s than the day 615 models .",
    "the equivalent optical depth increase from day 615 to 775 is due to the fact that for the volume filling factor to decrease from 5 to 3% whilst keeping the same dust mass , the dust number density in each individual clump must increase , hence making it harder for radiation produced in the internal regions of the clumps to escape .",
    "the decrease of the clump covering factor from day 615 to 775 is physically justified under the assumption that no clumps and no extra dust condensed between day 615 to day 775 .",
    "if this were true then the expansion of the inner radius from 5@xmath5610@xmath62 cm to 5.7@xmath5610@xmath62 cm would imply a decrease of the volume covering factor from @xmath28=0.05 to @xmath28=0.034 . however , best fit of the sed implies @xmath28 = 0.03 , causing therefore the increase of @xmath57 from 1.4 to 2.0 reported in table  1 .",
    "the behaviour of clumpy  ii models is somewhat different ; the volume filling factor here has to increase from 0.1 to 0.3 in order to fit the decrease of the sed in the optical from day 615 to day 775 .",
    "as discussed in section  3.2 , once the clumps become optically thick , the only factor affecting the optical sed is @xmath28 , with the main effect of varying the dust mass being on the temperature of the grains and therefore on the ir emission . in this model",
    "the total dust mass also increases between the two epochs , implying that as new grains form new clumps also form .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that clumps form early on by rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the explosion , and remain imprinted in the ejecta .",
    "the increase in dust mass , might therefore be due to additional accretion .",

    ", width=321 ]    our dust mass estimates are dependent on the assumed dust chemistry .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : amcvgraphvsilmrn ] , amorphous carbon grains with hanner ( 1998 ) optical constants have higher absorption coefficients per unit mass in the optical and near - ir than either astronomical graphite or silicate grains with @xcite optical constants .",
    "the amorphous carbon models therefore require the least mass to fit the observed seds of sn  1987a .",
    "graphite models require between 2 and 3 times as much mass to provide a fit .",
    "silicate - only models would require even larger dust masses , due to their even lower optical and near - ir absorption coefficients ; however pure silicate models are ruled out for sn  1987a by the lack of detectable 10- and 18-@xmath14 m silicate emission or absorption features in any of the mid - ir spectra of sn  1987a ( w93 ; roche et al .",
    "1993 ; bouchet & danziger 1993 ) .",
    "after day 530 , the emission - line strengths of [ si  i ] 1.65@xmath14 m , [ mg  i ] 4571 , and [ o  i ] 6300  decreased significantly @xcite , consistent with the formation of _ some _ fraction of silicate dust .",
    "we therefore tried a number of mixtures of astronomical silicates and graphite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp ] shows fits to the day 615 w93 data obtained with our clumpy  ii model using 50%  :  50% ( green dash - dot line ) , 25%  :  75% ( blue dash - dot line ) and 15%  :  85% ( cyan dash - dot - dot line ) astronomical silicate  :  graphite mixtures , all with masses of 1.3@xmath210@xmath5m@xmath4 ( red dotted line ) , i.e. twice as large as for the clumpy  ii graphite model .",
    "the 50%  :  50% silicate : graphite and 25%  :  75% mixtures produce too strong 10- and 18-@xmath14 m silicate absorption features compared to the observational limits .",
    "however , the 15%  :  85% silicate : graphite model produces a smooth enough mid - ir spectrum to be consistent with the observations .",
    "due to the high optical absorption coefficients of amorphous carbon grains , the clumpy  ii day 615 amorphous carbon mass estimate of 2.2@xmath210@xmath3  m@xmath4 ( table  [ tab : bestfit ] ) is likely to represent a lower limit to the total mass of dust that condensed in the ejecta of sn  1987a , while the mixed silicate : graphite mass of 1.3@xmath210@xmath5  m@xmath4 , discussed in the previous paragraph , probably represents close to an upper limit .",
    "iron grains have optical absorption coefficients in the optical that are intermediate between those of astronomical graphite and silicate , while lacking the strong infrared features that eliminate silicate - only models . however , direct observational evidence for iron grains in circumstellar or interstellar environments is still lacking .",
    "m photometric points at day 793 ( triangles ) are from @xcite.,width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : comp ] shows a comparison between the day 678 optical - ir spectrum of sn  2003gd @xcite and the day 615 and day 775 spectra of sn  1987a ( w93 ) , after scaling to a common distance of 51  kpc .",
    "it shows similarities between their seds in the optical and 1630-@xmath14 m regions , but differences in the 38-@xmath14 m region . the day 678 clumpy model for sn  2003gd @xcite , required a dust mass that is 13 times higher than the maximum mass allowed for mixed graphite : silicate models of sn  1987a and 27 times higher than our day 775 clumpy  ii pure graphite mass estimate for sn  1987a .",
    "the main reason for this difference is the very different opacities of the dust mixtures required to fit the seds of the two sne ; in the case of sn  2003gd , a dust mixture composed of 15% amorphous carbon and 85% astronomical silicates provided the best fit @xcite , while the maximum silicate mass fraction allowed for sn  1987a is only 15% , due to its featureless mid - ir spectrum at late epochs .",
    "astronomical silicates are much more transparent to optical and near - ir radiation than are amorphous carbon or graphite grains , and therefore require larger dust masses to match a given sed .",
    "furthermore , the much higher optical albedos of silicate grains allows much larger masses to be inside clumps , for similar levels of ir emission , though the silicate 10-@xmath14 m feature should be present in emission or absorption ( mainly the latter ) .",
    "we note that models containing only carbon grains did not provide a good fit to the day 499 optical - ir spectrum of sn  2003gd , producing too much emission in the 210-@xmath14 m region .",
    "the model fits imply that the proportions of silicates and carbon grains were reversed in sn  1987a and sn  2003gd .",
    "the mass of the immediate progenitor of sn  2003gd is estimated to have been 8@xmath64  m  @xmath4 @xcite , while the mass of sk  69  202 , the progenitor of sn  1987a , is estimated to have been @xmath1220  m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "nucleosynthetic calculations show that although large masses of oxygen should be produced by high mass supernovae , below 20  m  @xmath4 the yield of oxygen from the o - rich zone can drop below the yield of carbon from the c - rich zone @xcite , although the results are highly sensitive to details of some of the adopted reaction rates @xcite .",
    "irrespective of this , @xcite and @xcite have shown that due to the destruction by ionizing particles of co , and the consequent disruption of the normal co sink for carbon atoms in oxygen - rich regions , large quantities of carbon - rich dust particles can form easily in sn ejecta zones that have c / o@xmath651 .",
    "what remains to be elucidated is what causes either silicate or carbon grains to dominate the dust produced by particular supernovae .",
    "we have studied the effects of a number of clumping parameters on the seds emerging from two geometrical configurations , consisting of a spherical shell of clumpy medium illuminated by a diffuse radiation source .",
    "clumpy  i models assume full mixing between the dust and the radiating medium , while clumpy  ii models assume that dust is only present in the clumps and the illuminating radiation comes only from the icm .      1 .   varying the volume filling factor , @xmath28 has opposite effects in clumpy  i and clumpy  ii models . for a constant dust mass , @xmath47 and clump to icm ratio , @xmath46 ,",
    "an increase in @xmath28 in clumpy  i models causes a decrease in the effective optical depth , with less optical radiation being reprocessed at ir wavelengths . in clumpy",
    "ii models @xmath28 directly controls the amount of optical radiation being intercepted by the dust , since the illumination source is always external of the clumps .",
    "this is the same behaviour shown by centrally illuminated shell models . 2 .",
    "in the range explored , variations of @xmath46 in clumpy  i models ( constant @xmath47 and constant @xmath28 ) have only a minor impact on the emerging seds .",
    "3 .   for models",
    "where the emitting source is intermixed with the dusty medium , dust grains can not be hidden in optically thick clumps .",
    "for these models a degeneracy exists between @xmath47 and @xmath28 which may not be resolved with ir sed observations alone .",
    "4 .   for clumpy",
    "ii models with optically thick clumps , an increase in @xmath47 results in cooler grains which will therefore radiate at longer ir wavelengths .",
    "we used both smoothly varying and clumped dust density distributions to obtain new estimates for the mass of dust condensed by the type  ii sn  1987a by fitting the 0.3 - 30@xmath14 m spectrophotometric data of @xcite at two epochs ( day 615 and day 775 ) . from our modelling we conclude that between 2@xmath7 and 1.3@xmath66  m@xmath4 of mainly carbon - based grains had formed in the ejecta by day 615 ( 47@xmath7  m@xmath4 ) for pure graphite models ) with the derived dust masses being found to be independent of whether the dust was clumped or not .",
    "this result differs from the conclusions of w93 , who derived unclumped graphite dust masses of 46@xmath67  m@xmath4 on days 615 and 775 , versus graphite masses from their analytic clumped dust modelling of 35@xmath7  m@xmath4 .",

    "the cause of such very different dust yields amongst type  ii core - collapse supernovae remains to be explained ."
