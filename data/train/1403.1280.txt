    "one of the most promising `` smoking - gun '' signals for establishing the existence of the dark matter particle is the possible observation of a sharp cosmic @xmath0-ray line from dark matter annihilation or decay @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming cherenkov telescopes @xcite , the current fermi large area telescope @xcite and the hess instrument @xcite will allow to probe this possibility with further sensitivity . if such a signal is observed in the near future , the question of the identification of the dm particle that could have caused it will become crucial . such a signal could be induced through annihilation , coannihilation or decay . for all these scenarios , it is generally assumed that the photon is emitted through the loop of a charged particle . beside this general class of models , there exist other ways along which dm could emit monochromatic photons .",
    "one possibility consists in assuming that the @xmath0-ray line is due to a @xmath2 chern - simons interaction @xcite .",
    "another possibility , much less studied , would be to consider a photon directly emitted by the dm particle .",
    "this is a priori perfectly possible if dm is not exactly neutral , but is millicharged . for an annihilation such",
    "a possibility is not much of an option because the associated @xmath0-ray line would be in general suppressed with respect to the total cross section , by the square of the millicharge . given the constraints there are on the total cross section ( in particular from the relic density in the thermal freezeout scenario ) , this would lead to a signal sizeably smaller than present or near future sensitivities .",
    "instead for a decay , there is a priori more freedom because the decay lifetime is not so directly constrained by the relic density . in this work we consider such a decay possibility .    in the following",
    "we will first consider the two main frameworks that can in a simple way justify a millicharge for the dm particle , kinetic mixing and stueckelberg scenarios .",
    "in such scenarios , in order to justify that the dm particle would have a slow decay , we assume that its stability is due to an accidental symmetry that , being accidental , would be naturally broken by any uv physics . along these lines , the decay is naturally slow because suppressed by powers of the uv scale , just as expected for the proton .",
    "the appropriate language to consider in a model - independent way the possibility of a slow decay is therefore the one of the higher - dimensional operator effective theory .",
    "unlike for an annihilation , the use of an effective theory for a decay is fully justified since one expects a clear scale separation .",
    "consequently , such an effective theory allows for a systematic study of possibilities .",
    "we will determine all dimension - five and dimension - six operators that can lead to a two - body radiative decay from a millicharged fermion , scalar or vector dm particle .",
    "these operators come in addition to the effective operators which can lead to a @xmath0-ray line in the case where dm would be exactly neutral , given and studied in ref .",
    "the former operators involve a covariant derivative of the millicharged field , whereas the latter ones can involve a photon only from the presence of a hypercharge or @xmath3 field strength @xmath4 in the operator .    in the following",
    ", we will perform a detailed analysis of the constraints that hold on the various `` millicharged operators '' for the fermionic dm case .",
    "the scalar and vector cases will be discussed more briefly before concluding .",
    "a simple constraint that turns out to be relevant in some cases is that the dm particle lifetime should be larger than the age of the universe .",
    "another one concerns the emission of cosmic rays ( cr ) that could be associated to the one of the photon , either from the particle that accompanies the photon in the decay final state , or from other decays that the effective operator unavoidably predicts on top of the radiative one .",
    "gauge invariance in particular predicts decays where the photon is replaced by a @xmath5 .",
    "if the electromagnetic coupling to the @xmath5 is not millicharge suppressed , the flux of cosmic rays produced is much larger than the flux of monochromatic photons .",
    "in particular , if the particle accompanying the photon in the final state is a neutrino , which is the only standard model ( sm ) particle possibility ( a decay of special interest being `` poly - monochromatic '' , i.e.  monochromatic for both types of cosmic rays that are the less affected while propagating ) , we will see that an observable @xmath0-ray line is not an option , unless the dm mass is quite low . therefore , except for this case , the possibilities we will find point towards multi - component dm scenarios .",
    "other constraints are related to the fact that along the stueckelberg scenario the dm particle is charged under a new @xmath6 gauge group , which may be at the origin of the unsuppressed emission of the associated @xmath7 .",
    "a millicharge for a particle can either be postulated as just so ( from assuming an hypercharge such that @xmath8 is small ) or induced from a dynamical process , typically a small mixing parameter between the sm hypercharge gauge boson and a new @xmath6 gauge boson .",
    "the first option requires another particle to carry just so the same millicharge in such a way that the dm particle can decay into it . for the more appealing second option",
    ", one can point out two simple scenarios , depending on whether the @xmath6 gauge boson is massless or massive .      in the massless case ,",
    "a millicharge is induced for an originally neutral particle if the unbroken @xmath6 gauge boson kinetically mixes with the hypecharge gauge group @xcite , @xmath9 applying first a non - unitary transformation to get rid of this non - canonical kinetic term , one can always in a second step rotate both gauge boson fields with a unitary transformation because both gauge bosons are massless .",
    "there is therefore some arbitrariness in defining both fields .",
    "we make the convenient choice to go to the basis where the state which is essentially the hypercharge gauge boson couples to both @xmath10 and @xmath11 generators , whereas the other one , which is essentially the @xmath6 gauge boson , couples only to the @xmath11 generator .",
    "it allows to put the kinetic mixing suppression in the production decay process rather than in the detection , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite . in this basis , and after electroweak symmetry breaking , the covariant derivative @xmath12 becomes    @xmath13    with @xmath14 . a field with charges @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath11 couples to the photon field @xmath17 with charge @xmath18 with @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", a field with @xmath20 acquires a millicharge @xmath21 .",
    "note that everywhere in the following we will make the approximation @xmath22 .",
    "existing constraints on the parameters apply in general on the millicharge @xmath23 , rather than on @xmath24 directly , see below .",
    "a value of @xmath25 is therefore not excluded .",
    "however , it is generally expected smaller than one .",
    "for instance , if we consider the minimal scenario where the only dm couplings are those of eq.([lagrangian_kin_mix ] ) , the thermal relic abundance of the dm is provided by the annihilation into dark photons . by requiring the right dark matter abundance",
    ", we get a value for @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 this constraint together with eq .",
    "( [ mc_bound ] ) below gives the bound @xmath28 , justifying our approximation .",
    "it is well known that if the @xmath6 symmetry is spontaneously broken , so that the corresponding gauge boson becomes massive , a kinetic mixing interaction does not induce any millicharge for an originally neutral field . in the massive case there",
    "exists nevertheless the stueckelberg option .",
    "the stueckelberg mechanism allows to have a massive gauge boson without breaking the corresponding gauge symmetry .",
    "we will here consider an extension of the sm by a @xmath6 as in @xcite .",
    "this model contains a scalar which has stueckelberg couplings to both @xmath29 and @xmath6 . as a consequence , the neutral gauge bosons mix , and in the mass eigenstates basis the covariant",
    "derivative reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the sine and cosine of the various angles with @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the `` bare '' mass of the @xmath35 gauge boson , respectively @xcite .",
    "the expression of the electromagnetic charge is @xmath36 , with @xmath37 . in this way ,",
    "an originally neutral field acquires a charge of @xmath38 .",
    "note that the stueckelberg scenario as origin of a millicharged dm ( like the `` just - so '' scenario ) might be questioned by considerations of quantum gravity / string theory @xcite .",
    "the list of possible radiative decays that could be generated by the millicharge of a particle is extremely reduced and in this sense points towards a rather precise kind of scenario . for the fermion dm case ,",
    "there is only one decay possibility ,",
    "@xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 necessarily carrying the same millicharge . in the following , when establishing the list of operators that could lead to a sizable monochromatic photon signal , we will not specify the exact nature of the fermionic partner of the dm in these operators . it could be either a dirac or a majorana fermion , and it could be either a particle beyond the sm or a neutrino .",
    "the former option points towards a multi - component fermion dm scenario . note that the results obtained below , in particular those of fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_mix ] , do not depend on how the abundancies of these components pile up to saturate the observed value of @xmath42 , except those depending on the direct detection constraints on a millicharge .",
    "up to dimension six , there is only a very limited number of operators that can induce a @xmath39 decay from the millicharge of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "first of all , we only find a single dimension - five operator @xmath43 for this operator and all operators below , the addition of its hermitian conjugate is implicit",
    ". do not give any radiative two - body decays because this would require that the scalar field has both a vev and a millicharge , which would give a mass to the photon .",
    "similarly , operators with a @xmath44 or @xmath45 do not give any radiative decays as can be seen from the use of the equations of motion .",
    "note also that operators with an additional @xmath46 are redundant since both fermions in the operator are different fields ( i.e.  it can always be reabsorbed in the definition of one of the fermion field ) . ]",
    "the presence of the @xmath47 implies that this operator can be rewritten as a sum of operators where both covariant derivatives have been replaced by a sum of field strengths of the gauge boson to which the particle couples ( each one multiplied by the corresponding gauge coupling ) .",
    "dipole operators ( as relevant for example for the @xmath48 decay ) , with the difference that the photon would here be radiated by a millicharged particle instead of a charged lepton or charged gauge boson . ]    as for the dimension - six operators we find only three possibilities , @xmath49    their structure are equivalent up to one operator that does not produce monochromatic photons but can give other decays ( including two - body decays ) , hence different amounts of cosmic rays .",

    "( [ ofdpsisig ] ) , the covariant derivative of the operators of eqs .",
    "( [ o6fdpsisig ] , [ o6fddmsig ] ) can be traded for a sum of field strengths . in summary ,",
    "up to dimension six , we are left with four operator structures only , as given in eq .",
    "( [ ofdpsisig ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ o6fdpsisig])-([o6fd2sig ] ) . at the two - body decay level ,",
    "the scalar field in the last three operators can intervene only through its vev . for the quantum numbers of these fields",
    "there is in principle an infinity of possibilities and we will see how , when considering the constraints on the various operators , a simple global picture can emerge despite of this fact .",
    "as for the non - millicharged operators in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are a priori essentially two main ways to constraint the operators and thus to possibly discriminate between them , from @xmath0-ray line spectral features and from the associated continuum of cosmic rays produced .",
    "the fact that the lifetime of the dm particle must be longer than the age of the universe provides an additional constraint which is relevant in special cases .    by spectral features",
    "we mean the number of @xmath0-ray lines produced , their relative energies and relative intensities .",
    "however , for the millicharged operators there is no way to get more than one @xmath0-ray line from a unique given operator since in the final state , on top of the photon , one can only find the @xmath41 particle .    to determine what are the possibilities to distinguish among the various operators from a cosmic ray multi - channel analysis , we will proceed as for the case of non - millicharged operators in ref .",
    "the whole issue is that for a given operator , due to gauge invariance , there always is a continuum flux of cosmic rays associated to the production of a @xmath0-ray line , especially if its energy is larger than the @xmath5 boson mass .",
    "the decay rate of the dm particle into photons is proportional to its millicharge squared .",
    "therefore , to determine the upper bounds existing on the photon over cosmic rays ratios , we will need to know ( in some cases ) what are the bounds which hold on the millicharge of a metastable particle within the mass range we consider , @xmath50 gev . in this mass range , there are no relevant accelerator constraints @xcite .",
    "there are nevertheless stringent constraints from cosmology as well as from direct detection data . as well - known , in the usual @xmath51cdm model , which fits well both the cmb anisotropy and large scale structure data , it is assumed that there is no dm - baryon interaction other than gravitational .",
    "an additional dm - baryon interaction such as the one provided by a millicharge modifies this picture by rendering dm effectively `` baryonic '' .",
    "this affects the cmb power spectrum as well as the baryon acoustic oscillations , leading to the upper bound @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the dm - baryon momentum - transfer cross - section and @xmath54 is the dm - baryon relative velocity . in our case",
    ", the relevant cross - section is the rutherford one and @xmath55 eq .",
    "( [ cmb_bound ] ) translates into the following bound on the dm millicharge @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant .",
    "the direct detection bounds are much more model - dependent than the cmb ones .",
    "they crucially depend on the mass of the particle exchanged between the nucleon and the dm particle . in the massless @xmath6 gauge boson case , the elastic nucleon - dm scattering is proportional to the inverse of the recoil energy squared , @xmath58 .",
    "this results in a huge enhancement of the scattering cross section with respect to the usual wimp case where the cross section is typically suppressed by the inverse of the square of the gev - tev mass of the particle exchanged . for @xmath59  few  gev this results in upper bounds on the millicharge of order of @xmath60-@xmath61 , see fig .",

    "@xcite . beyond these values ,",
    "the upper bound on the millicharge scales as @xmath65 , so that it quickly becomes weaker than the cmb bound ( this occurs for @xmath66 gev ) . in the following ,",
    "when the bound on the millicharge is relevant to determine the upper bound on the @xmath0-ray line , we use the cmb bound .",
    "we will see that this bound already excludes an observable @xmath0-ray line for these cases ( hence a fortiori when the direct detection bounds are stronger , this is even more excluded ) .",
    "note also that all these direct detection constraints assume a standard local dm density , which might not apply depending on how large the dm particle millicharge is , because it can be shielded by galactic magnetic fields @xcite . for instance , when @xmath67 , the depletion of the local dm relic density from magnetic shielding begins to be sizeable , therefore weakening the direct detection bounds .",

    "the issue here is that in the massless hidden gauge boson case , the dm particle does not only decay to @xmath145 but it also does to @xmath146 . as the @xmath147 does not produce any cosmic rays , the latter decay is not relevant for fig .  1 .",
    "however , it is naturally faster than the former decay by a factor of @xmath148 .",
    "one has therefore to make sure that the resulting lifetime is not shorter than the age of the universe . imposing that @xmath149 , and imposing that the millicharge satisfies the cmb bound of eq .",
    "( [ mc_bound ] ) , we show in fig .",
    "2 the upper limits which hold on the intensity of the @xmath0-ray line for various values of the dark charge @xmath141 . clearly ,",
    "for large values of @xmath141 one gets competitive bounds with respect to those derived from @xmath0-ray line direct searches , whereas smaller values give irrelevant bounds .",
    "2 also shows the constraints we get assuming the direct detection bounds mentioned above ( i.e.  fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "@xcite , disregarding possible weakening of these bounds from magnetic shielding ) .",
    "these constraints are quite stringent , leading to unobservable @xmath0-ray lines , unless the dark charge is small enough . in fact",
    ", @xmath150 is necessary in order to get @xmath151 .",
    "these constraints are obtained assuming that the relic density of @xmath40 is the observed one . for smaller relic density values",
    "one gets weaker constraints . in the stueckelberg case ,",
    "all these considerations become obviously irrelevant as soon as the @xmath7 gauge boson mass is above @xmath129 ( or above @xmath152  gev for what concerns the direct detection bounds ) .",
    "from the above results it is clear that , since the neutrino is not a sm singlet , it is not an option within the @xmath154  gev range considered above . moreover in this case",
    ", since the millicharge of both fermions in the various operators must be equal , and since the millicharge of the neutrinos is extremely well bounded , the millicharge of the dm particle is also extremely well constrained .",
    "the most stringent constraint applies on the electronic neutrino .",
    "assuming charge conservation in @xmath155 decay , and using the experimental results from @xcite and @xcite : @xmath156 and @xmath157 , the constraint @xmath158 is obtained .",
    "independent , less stringent upper bounds also hold from neutrino magnetic dipole moment searches , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in the case of @xmath159 and @xmath160 ,",
    "the most stringent constraints come from stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos acquire a millicharge , their electromagnetic interactions would provoke extra energy losses in the core of red giants .",
    "this would delay the time of helium ignition , and as a consequence , the core of red giants would be heavier than in the standard case when helium lights up .",
    "but the mass of the red giant core at helium ignition is constrained by measurements from globular clusters .",
    "these constraints turn into the following bound on the charge of neutrinos : @xmath161 .",
    "this bound holds as long as @xmath162 kev , implying that it applies to all flavours . to get a lifetime allowing for an observable @xmath0-ray line , the huge suppression due to this millicharge could in principle",
    "be compensated by considering smaller @xmath51 scales , taking typically @xmath163 gev for dimension - five operators , and @xmath164 gev for dimension - six operators . however , since the @xmath5 emission rate is enhanced with respect to the @xmath0 emission by a factor of @xmath165 , this would clearly imply a decay rate to @xmath166 leading to a lifetime much shorter than the lifetime of the universe .",
    "similarly this would have given a huge amount of cosmic rays . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_mix ] and rescale them by a factor of @xmath167 where @xmath168 refers to the bound of eq .",
    "( [ mc_bound ] ) .",
    "] therefore , due to several reasons , a line observed at the present sensitivities with energies above the @xmath5 mass could not be attributed at all to a millicharged dm decaying in neutrino and photon through one of the operators under study .",
    "more generally , one could ask whether this possibility is also excluded for lower dm masses . here , there are a priori two directly connected constraints which must be fulfilled , giving an upper and a lower bound on @xmath129 .",
    "the upper bound comes from the fact that , even if for @xmath169 the @xmath5 can not be produced on its mass shell , it can be produced off - shell and subsequently decay to a pair of fermions .",
    "this could result in a lifetime shorter than the age of the universe and/or to too many cosmic rays .",
    "for instance , supposing that a @xmath0 line , to be observable , must result from a two - body decay typically giving a lifetime @xmath170  sec , it is easy to see that the three - body decay lifetime ( from @xmath171 ) is shorter than the age of the universe , unless @xmath172 the limit coming from the single neutrino channel gives therefore a strong enough limit on @xmath129 to render irrelevant the limits one could get from all other possible @xmath5 decay channel , except from the @xmath173 channel .",
    "it is easy to see that the latter channel gives up to a very good approximation the stronger constraint , @xmath174 which holds in order to avoid overproduction of galactic center @xmath175  kev photon from overproduction of positrons .",
    "the limit on the lifetime of a dm particle with mass below @xmath176  mev is given by @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "as for the lower bound , it comes from the fact that , if one decreases too much @xmath129 , one gets a decay into a photon and a neutrino which is too slow to account for any observable photon line that could be detected in the future .",
    "for instance , let us consider the x - ray line recently reported with energy @xmath1  kev and flux @xmath178 @xcite . assuming a standard dm density along the line of sight , such a line , if better confirmed experimentally , could be understood from a dm decay into a photon and a neutrino , if the lifetime is @xmath179 s @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to stress that such kind of lines could in principle be accounted for by any model leading to one of the fermion radiative operator reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the non - millicharged case ) or by any of the millicharged operators considered here , provided the operator can match the constraint that @xmath41 must be a lepton doublet and @xmath40 must be a singlet ( as its mass must lie in the kev range ) .",
    "mass , also holds for lower mass . to explain this recently reported line",
    ", one would not need necessarily to assume a fermion dm candidate .",
    "the scalar or vector operators given in this reference , or in section [ scalarvector ] below , could also account for it , provided there exists another lighter scalar or vector particle to accompany the photon in the decay final state .",
    "to distinguish among these operators appears to be hopeless , given the fact that the associated neutrino flux is basically unobservable at these energies .",
    "for various other possible explanations of this line , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ] for the millicharge option this latter requirement excludes the dimension - five operator but not the three dimension - six operators of eqs .",
    "( [ o6fdpsisig])-([o6fd2sig ] ) with @xmath88 the scalar sm doublet . for these operators",
    "one has nevertheless to check that for such low masses , and given the stringent constraints on the millicharge of neutrinos , one can get a lifetime of order the one needed .",
    "the radiative lifetime one gets for any of these three operators is the same @xmath180 which , for the parameter values indicated , is about the one needed . given the uncertainties on the experimental flux needed , on the dm lifetime needed , and on the bounds on the neutrino millicharge from red giants , at the effective theory approach level one concludes that a small millicharge for the neutrino could be at the origin of this @xmath0-ray line , or more generally of observable kev - mev low energy lines , provided there is new physics around the corner at colliders and provided that the millicharge of the @xmath159 or @xmath160 is close to its upper bound . in other words , despite of the very stringent bounds which exist on them , neutrino millicharges could consequently have an observable effect in the form of a x - ray line .",
    "note also that within the kev - mev mass range discussed here , for @xmath181 kev , the generation of the relic density for a fermionic sm singlet dm can nevertheless be challenging @xcite .",
    "finally , remark that in the kinetic mixing scenario , imposing as above that @xmath182 , gives the constraint @xmath183 , which means @xmath184 .",
    "after studying the possibility for a millicharged dm of the fermionic type to emit an observable @xmath0-ray line through its decay , we now turn to the scalar and vector dm cases .",
    "if the dm particle is of the scalar or vector type , there also exist operators that could a priori lead to such a line . for what concerns the emission of cosmic rays , the phenomenology of these operators turns out to be similar to the fermion case .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will limit ourselves to the determination of the operators and to a few additional general comments which slightly distinguish these scenarios from the fermion case .",
    "due to angular momentum conservation considerations , a scalar dm particle can not decay to a scalar and a massless gauge boson .",
    "therefore , it can only decay to a photon and another massive spin - one particle , which necessarily carries the same millicharge . as a result ,",
    "the scalar case is similar to the vector case .",
    "the operators that can allow a decay of a scalar dm particle into a vector particle and a photon , could also hold for a vector dm particle decaying into a scalar and a photon . in principle , a vector dm particle could nevertheless also decay in a different way , into a photon and another vector particle .",
    "note that a necessary condition for the vector dm to acquire a millicharge is to be a complex field , therefore associated to a non - abelian gauge group .    for the scalar - vector - photon case we found only one dimension - five operator @xmath185 and two dimension - six operators @xmath186 as said above , in these operators the dm particle can be either one of the scalar particle or a vector particle , the latter in one of the covariant derivative of eq .",
    "( [ osv6fdd ] ) or in one of the non - abelian hidden sector @xmath187 field strengths of eqs  ( [ osv5])-([osv6ff ] ) .",
    "the photon can show up from one of the @xmath187 field strengths , through gauge boson mixing .",
    "this occurs for instance if , on top of a kinetic mixing between the hypercharge gauge boson and a @xmath6 gauge boson , there is , through symmetry breaking , a mixing between this @xmath6 gauge boson and gauge boson(s ) of the new non - abelian symmetry ( whose field strength is @xmath187 ) . in this way",
    "the @xmath187 field strength provides a photon field proportionally to the millicharge of the complex gauge boson in this field strength . ) and a @xmath188 @xmath187 field strengths , both field strengths must be taken in their quintuplet combination , which means that the scalar field is a quintuplet . ]",
    "note that no operator containing only covariant derivatives remains .",
    "this can be shown using equations of motion and rotating away non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "operator ( [ osv6fdd ] ) is equivalent to op .",
    "( [ osv6ff ] ) up to operators that do not produce monochromatic photons .    for the two operators of eqs .",
    "( [ osv5])-([osv6ff ] ) , the emission of a @xmath5 is always suppressed by the millicharge squared , even if the scalars are non - sm singlet .",
    "this stems from the fact that the @xmath5 as the @xmath0 can come only from the field strength in these operators , not from a covariant derivative as for the fermion operators .",
    "this means that one gets the eq .",
    "( [ ratio_a ] ) prediction even if the scalars are not sm singlets ( up to corrections in @xmath189 for @xmath190 ) .",
    "of course , as for the fermion case , one can saturate the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ ratio_a ] ) only if there is no cosmic ray production from @xmath7 decay ( in the stueckelberg case ) .",
    "the latter could arise from the decay where the photon is replaced by a @xmath7 if this decay ( which is not suppressed by the value of the millicharge squared ) is not kinematically forbidden and if the @xmath7 subsequently decays into sm particles . as for the operator of eq .",
    "( [ osv6fdd ] ) , it can lead to a non - millicharge suppressed production of @xmath5 and @xmath83 from the covariant derivatives , if the scalars are non - sm singlets .",
    "its phenomenology is therefore very similar to the one of the fermion operators .",
    "finally , about the possibility that a vector dm particle could decay into a photon and another vector particle , one could think about operators with only @xmath187 field strengths , for instance @xmath191 , through a similar mechanism where a @xmath187 could give a photon through gauge boson mixing .",
    "we did not find any simple realization of such a possibility .",
    "in summary , there are very few ways of probing the dm hypothesis that can really be considered in a systematic and model - independent way . however , for the decay of an absolutely neutral dm particle into a @xmath0-ray line , this turns out to be feasible @xcite .",
    "this stems from the facts that , on the one hand , the use of an effective theory is fully justified , slow enough decay can naturally be explained from a much higher scale physics , and , on the other hand , it turns out that there are very few operator structures of this kind .",
    "@xcite considered the usual scenario where the dm particle is absolutely neutral so that the photon appears in the operator through a field strength ( i.e. typically from a charged particle in a loop ) . here",
    "we show that , for the same reasons , such a study can also be systematically carried out in the less considered scenario where the dm is millicharged , having therefore a tree - level coupling to the photon through a covariant derivative , either from an ad - hoc millicharge , or through mixing of the @xmath29 gauge boson with another @xmath6 gauge boson .    to the emission of a @xmath0-ray line from such operators",
    "is associated the emission of a continuum of cosmic rays .",
    "the monochromatic photon to cosmic ray flux ratio is determined by the sm quantum numbers of the field on which the covariant derivative applies ( and in one case also crucially on the dm mass ) , and if this particle is not a sm singlet on the value of its millicharge .",
    "this leads to upper bounds on the intensity of the @xmath0-ray line produced , given in fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_mix ] .",
    "this figure shows that if the dm is only charged under the dark sector , it can lead to a line matching the present experimental sensitivities without overshooting the bound on the flux of antiprotons and diffuse photons . on the contrary , when the particle emitting the photon from its millicharge is also charged under the sm , the cosmic rays constraints are much stronger than direct searches for spectral lines .",
    "therefore , in this case , if a line were to be detected with energy above the @xmath5 mass and with about the present experimental sensitivity , it could not be explained in such a way .",
    "such a conclusion can also hold for @xmath129 far below the @xmath5 mass .    for the massless hidden gauge boson case ( and the massive case where @xmath192 is both below the gev scale and smaller than @xmath129 ) relevant additional constraints show up imposing that the two - body decay width to a @xmath147 ( z ) leads to a lifetime longer than the age of the universe . combining this constraint with the direct detection bounds on a millicharge ,",
    "an observable @xmath0-ray line requires small values of the dark charge @xmath141 .    as for a decay into a neutrino and a photon ,",
    "given the stringent constraints that exist on the millicharge of a neutrino , the @xmath5 mediated decay into three neutrinos , or into a neutrino and a electron - positron pair , this possibility is forbidden unless @xmath129 is below the mev scale . for lower masses , and down to the kev scale , an observable line induced in this way",
    "is not excluded by these considerations .",
