    "being the fundamental resource in a wide range of situations in quantum information processing , entanglement is considered as a ` standard currency ' for quantum information tasks , and it is highly desirable to know which states of a given system exhibit a high or maximal amount of entanglement @xcite .",
    "when it comes to multipartite states this question becomes complicated .",
    "there are different _ types _ of entanglement @xcite , alongside which there are many different ways to quantify entanglement , each of which may capture a different desirable quality of a state as a resource .    in this work , the geometric measure of entanglement , a distance - like entanglement measure @xcite , will be investigated to analyze maximally entangled multipartite states .",
    "there are several incentives to consider this particular measure .",
    "firstly , it has a broad range of operational interpretations : for example , in local state discrimination @xcite , additivity of channel capacities @xcite and recently for the classification of states as resources for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc)@xcite .",
    "another advantage of the geometric measure is that , while other known entanglement measures are notoriously difficult to compute from their variational definitions , the definition of the geometric measure allows for a comparatively easy calculation .",
    "furthermore , the geometric measure can be linked to other distance - like entanglement measures , such as the robustness of entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the function also has applications in signal processing , particularly in the fields of multi - way data analysis , high order statistics and independent component analysis ( ica ) , where it is known under the name _",
    "rank one approximation to high order tensors _",

    "we focus our attention on permutation - symmetric states  that is , states that are invariant when swapping any pair of particles .",
    "this class of states has been useful for different quantum information tasks ( for example , in leader election @xcite ) .",
    "it includes the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite , w states and dicke states @xcite , and also occurs in a variety of situations in many - body physics .",
    "there has been lots of activity recently in implementing these states experimentally @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the symmetric properties make them amenable to the analysis of entanglement properties @xcite",
    ".    an important tool in this work will be the majorana representation @xcite , a generalization of the bloch sphere representation of single qubits , where a permutation - symmetric state of @xmath0 qubits is unambiguously mapped to @xmath0 points on the surface of the unit sphere .",
    "recently , the majorana representation has proved very useful in analyzing entanglement properties of symmetric states @xcite .",
    "in particular , the geometric measure of entanglement has a natural interpretation , and the majorana representation facilitates exploitation of further symmetries to characterize entanglement @xcite . for example , the two - qubit symmetric bell state @xmath2 is represented by an antipodal pair of points : the north pole @xmath3 and the south pole @xmath4 . roughly speaking , symmetric states with a high degree of entanglement",
    "are represented by point distributions that are well spread out over the sphere .",
    "we will use this idea along with other symmetry arguments to look for the most entangled states . along the way we will compare this problem to other optimization problems of point distributions on the sphere .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ geometric_measure ] , the definition and properties of the geometric measure of entanglement are briefly recapitulated , which is followed by an introduction and discussion of symmetric states in section [ positive_and_symm ] . in section [ majorana_representation ] , the majorana representation of symmetric states",
    "is introduced .",
    "the problem of finding the maximally entangled state is phrased in this manner , and is compared to two other point distribution problems on @xmath1 : tth s problem and thomson s problem . in section [ analytic ] ,",
    "some theoretical results for symmetric states are derived with the help of the intuitive idea of the majorana representation .",
    "the numerically determined maximally entangled symmetric states of up to 12 qubits are presented in section [ maximally_entangled_symmetric_states ] .",
    "our results are discussed in section [ discussion ] , and section [ conclusion ] contains the conclusion .",
    "the geometric measure of entanglement is a distance - like entanglement measure for pure multipartite states that assesses the entanglement of a state in terms of its remoteness from the set of separable states @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the maximal overlap of a given pure state with all pure product states @xcite and is also defined as the geodesic distance with respect to the fubini - study metric @xcite . here",
    "we present it in the inverse logarithmic form of the maximal overlap , which is more convenient in relation to other entanglement measures : @xmath5 @xmath6 is non - negative and zero iff @xmath7 is a product state .",
    "we denote a product state closest to @xmath7 by @xmath8 , and it should be noted that a given @xmath7 can have more than one closest product state .",
    "indeed , we will usually deal with entangled states that have several closest product states . due to its compactness ,",
    "the normalized , pure hilbert space of a finite - dimensional system ( e.g. @xmath0 qudits ) always contains at least one state @xmath9 with maximal entanglement , and to each such state relates at least one closest product state .",
    "the task of determining maximal entanglement can be formulated as a max - min problem , with the two extrema not necessarily being unambiguous : @xmath10 it is often more convenient to define @xmath11 so that we obtain @xmath12 . because of the monotonicity of this relationship , the task of finding the maximally entangled state is equivalent to solving the min - max problem @xmath13 as mentioned in the introduction , there are several advantages of this measure of entanglement .",
    "first of all , it has several operational interpretations .",
    "it has implications for channel capacity @xcite and can also be used to give conditions as to when states are useful resources for mbqc @xcite .",
    "if the entanglement of a set of resource states scales anything below logarithmically with the number of parties , it can not be an efficient resource for deterministic universal mbqc @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , somewhat surprisingly , if the entanglement is too large , it is also not a good resource for mbqc .",
    "if the geometric measure of entanglement of an @xmath0 qubit system scales larger than @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is some constant ) , then such a computation can be simulated efficiently computationally @xcite .",
    "of course , we should also note that there are many other quantum information tasks that are not restricted by such requirements .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-qubit ghz state can be considered the most non - local with respect to all possible two - output , two - setting bell inequalities @xcite , whereas the geometric measure is only @xmath16 , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0-qubit w state , on the other hand , is the optimal state for leader election @xcite with entanglement @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , for local state discrimination , the role of entanglement in blocking the ability to access information locally is strictly monotonic  the higher the geometric measure of entanglement , the harder it is to access information locally @xcite .",
    "in addition , the geometric measure @xmath6 has close links to other distance - like entanglement measures , namely the ( global ) robustness of entanglement @xmath18 @xcite and the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath19 @xcite . between these measures the inequalities @xmath20 hold for all states @xcite , and they turn into equalities for stabilizer states ( e.g. ghz state ) , dicke states ( e.g. w state ) and permutation - antisymmetric basis states @xcite .",
    "an upper bound for the entanglement of pure @xmath0 qubit states is given in @xcite as @xmath21 we can see that this allows for states to be more entangled than is useful , e.g. for mbqc . indeed ,",
    "although no states of more than two qubits reach this bound @xcite , most states of @xmath0 qubits have entanglement @xmath22 @xcite . in the next section , we will see that symmetric states have generally lower entanglement .",
    "we can also make a general statement for positive states that will help us in calculating entanglement for this smaller class of states . for finite - dimensional systems",
    ", a general quantum state can be written in the form @xmath23 with an orthonormalized basis @xmath24 and complex coefficients @xmath25 .",
    "we will call @xmath7 a _ real state _",
    "if  for a given basis @xmath24  all coefficients are real ( @xmath26 ) , and likewise call @xmath27 a _ positive state _ if the coefficients are all positive ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "a _ computational basis _ is one made up of tensors of local bases .",
    "[ lem_positive ] every state @xmath7 of a finite - dimensional system that is positive with respect to some computational basis has at least one positive closest product state @xmath29 .",
    "picking any computational basis in which the coefficients of @xmath30 are all positive , we denote the basis of subsystem @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and can write the state as @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a closest product state of @xmath7 can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 ) is the state of subsystem @xmath31 .",
    "now define a new product state with positive coefficients as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "because of @xmath41 , the positive state @xmath42 is a closest product state of @xmath30 .",
    "this lemma , which was also shown in @xcite , asserts that positive states have at least one positive closest product state , but there can nevertheless exist other non - positive closest product states .",
    "a statement analogous to lemma [ lem_positive ] does not hold for real states , and it is easy to find examples of real states that have no real closest product state .",
    "from now on we will simply denote entanglement instead of referring to the geometric measure of entanglement .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that the maximally entangled state of a multipartite system subtly depends on the chosen entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "in general it is very difficult to find the closest product state of a given quantum state , due to the large amount of parameters in @xmath43 .",
    "the problem will be considerably simplified , however , when considering permutation - symmetric states . in experiments with many qubits , it is often not possible to access single qubits individually , necessitating a fully symmetrical treatment of the initial state and the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model was found to be permutation - invariant , and its entanglement was quantified in term of the geometric measure and its distance - related cousins @xcite . for these reasons",
    "it is worth analyzing various theoretical and experimental aspects of the entanglement of symmetric states , such as entanglement witnesses or experimental setups @xcite .",
    "the symmetric basis states of a system of @xmath0 qubits are given by the dicke states , the simultaneous eigenstates of the total angular momentum @xmath44 and its @xmath45-component @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "they are mathematically expressed as the sum of all permutations of computational basis states with @xmath47 qubits being @xmath3 and @xmath48 being @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath49 with @xmath50 , and where we omitted the tensor symbols that mediate between the @xmath0 single qubit spaces .",
    "the dicke states constitute an orthonormalized set of basis vectors for the symmetric hilbert space @xmath51 .",
    "the notation @xmath52 will sometimes be abbreviated as @xmath53 when the number of qubits is clear .",
    "recently , there has been a very active investigation into the conjecture that the closest product state of a symmetric state is symmetric itself @xcite .",
    "a proof of this seemingly straightforward statement is far from trivial , and after some special cases were proofed @xcite , hbener _",
    "_ @xcite were able to extend this result to the general case .",
    "they also showed that , for @xmath54 qudits ( general quantum @xmath55-level systems ) the closest product state of a symmetric state is _ necessarily _ symmetric .",
    "this result greatly reduces the complexity of finding the closest product state and thus the entanglement of a symmetric state .",
    "a general pure symmetric state of @xmath0 qubits is a linear combination of the @xmath56 symmetric basis states , with the operational nature being that the state remains invariant under the permutation of any two of its subsystems .",
    "a closest product state of @xmath57 is @xcite @xmath58 i.e. a tensor product of @xmath0 identical single qubit states . from this , the amount of entanglement is found to be @xmath59 this formula straightforwardly gives the maximally entangled dicke state .",
    "for even @xmath0 it is @xmath60 and for odd @xmath0 the two equivalent states @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in general , however , the maximally entangled symmetric state of @xmath0 qubits is a superposition of dicke states .",
    "nevertheless , equation can be used as a lower bound to the maximal entanglement of symmetric states .",
    "this bound can be approximated by the stirling formula for large @xmath0 as @xmath63 .",
    "an upper bound to the geometric measure for symmetric @xmath0 qubit states can be easily found from the well - known decomposition of the identity on the symmetric subspace ( denoted @xmath64 , see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the uniform probability measure over the unit sphere @xmath67 on hilbert space @xmath68 .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath69 .",
    "hence , for any symmetric state of @xmath0 qubits , the geometric measure of entanglement is upper bounded by @xmath70 an alternative proof that has the benefit of being visually accessible is presented in appendix [ normalization_bloch ] .",
    "the maximal symmetric entanglement for @xmath0 qubits thus scales polylogarithmically between @xmath71 and @xmath72 . to compare this with the general non - symmetric case ,",
    "consider the lower bound of the maximal @xmath0 qubit entanglement ( @xmath0 even ) of @xmath73 .",
    "qubit state with @xmath74 are @xmath75 bipartite bell states , each of which contributes 1 ebit .",
    "another example is the 2d cluster state of @xmath0 qubits which has @xmath74 . ]",
    "thus the maximal entanglement of general states scales much faster , namely linearly rather than logarithmically .",
    "as mentioned , for most states the entanglement is even higher and thus too entangled to be useful for mbqc . while the bounds for symmetric states mean that permutation - symmetric states are never too entangled to be useful for mbqc , unfortunately their scaling is also too low to be good universal deterministic resources @xcite",
    ". they may nevertheless be candidates for approximate , stochastic mbqc @xcite .",
    "regardless of their use as resources for mbqc , the comparatively high entanglement of symmetric states still renders them formidable candidates for specific quantum computations or as resources for other tasks , such as the leader election problem @xcite and locc discrimination @xcite .",
    "we end this section by mentioning a simplification with respect to symmetric positive states .",
    "states that are symmetric as well as positive in some computational basis are labelled as",
    "_ positive symmetric_. from the previous discussion it is clear that such states have a closest product state which is positive symmetric itself , a result first shown in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , while each closest product state of a positive symmetric state is _ necessarily _ symmetric for @xmath54 qudits , it _ need not _ be positive .",
    "we can formulate this as a statement akin to lemma [ lem_positive ] .",

    "with the discussion of the geometric measure and symmetric states behind us , we have gathered the prerequisites to introduce a crucial tool , the majorana representation .",
    "it will help us to understand the amount of entanglement of symmetric states .      in classical physics , the angular momentum @xmath78 of a system can be represented by a point on the surface of the 3d unit sphere @xmath1 , which corresponds to the direction of @xmath78 .",

    "we call these points the _ majorana points _ ( mp ) , and the sphere on which they lie the _ majorana sphere_.    with equation , the form of a symmetric state @xmath87 can be explicitly determined if the mps are known .",
    "if the mps of a given state @xmath88 are unknown , they can be determined by solving a system of @xmath56 equations .",
    "@xmath89    the majorana representation has been rediscovered several times , and has been put to many different uses across physics . in relation to the foundations of quantum mechanics , it has been used to find efficient proofs of the kochen - specker theorem @xcite and to study the ` quantumness ' of pure quantum states in several respects @xcite , as well as the approach to classicality in terms of the discriminability of states @xcite .",

    "of particular interest , in this work , is that it gives a natural visual interpretation of the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite , and we will see how symmetries in the point distributions can be used to calculate the entanglement and assist in finding the most entangled states",

    "the @xmath100 are the angles between the two corresponding points on the majorana sphere , and thus the determination of the cpp can be viewed as an optimization problem for a product of geometrical angles .",

    "figure11a ( -7.5,0)(a )    figure11b ( -7.5,0)(b )    the solution to tth s problem , which is of the form @xmath364 , yields very low entanglement , but by modifying the coefficients of this non - positive state one can find a state @xmath365 which is even more entangled than @xmath366 . as shown in figure [ bloch_11](b ) , the state is rotationally symmetric around the z - axis and has 11 cpps .",
    "the entanglement is @xmath367 , making the state the potentially maximally entangled state of 11 qubits .      for 12 points ,",
    "both of the classical problems are solved by the icosahedron , a platonic solid . because the icosahedron can not be cast as a positive state , the numerical search for positive states yields a different state of the form @xmath368 . from figure [ bloch_12](a ) it can be seen that this state can be thought of as an icosahedron with one circle of mps rotated by 36@xmath339 so that it is aligned with the mps of the other circle .",
    "there are three circles of cpps with five in each circle .",
    "one of these planes coincides with the equator , so that @xmath369 is a trivial cpp . nevertheless , the exact location of some of the mps and cpps are unknown .",
    "the approximate entanglement is @xmath370 .",
    "figure12a ( -7.5,0)(a )    figure12b ( -7.5,0)(b )    due to the high symmetry present in platonic solids , the ` icosahedron state ' is a strong candidate for maximal symmetric entanglement of twelve qubit states .",
    "the state can be cast with real coefficients @xmath371 , and its mps can be easily derived from the known angles and distances in the icosahedron .",
    "@xmath372 with @xmath332 . from numerics and from the z - axis rotational symmetry ,",
    "it is evident that there are 20 cpps , one at the center of each face of the icosahedron .",
    "equivalent to the six - qubit case , the mps appear as diametrically opposite pairs , forcing the cpps to be as remote from the mps as possible .",
    "the cpps are @xmath373 with @xmath374 and @xmath375 with the knowledge of the exact positions of the mps and cpps , the entanglement of the icosahedron state can be calculated as @xmath376 .",
    "figure [ icosahedronpic ] shows a spherical plot of the overlap function @xmath377 from the same viewpoint as in figure [ bloch_12](b ) . due to their diametrically opposite pairs , the mps",
    "coincide with the zeros in this plot .",
    "the cpps can be identified as the maxima of @xmath352 .",
    "the mp distribution of highly entangled states can be explained with the overlap function @xmath378 seen in figure [ icosahedronpic ] .",
    "appendix [ normalization_bloch ] states that the integration volume of @xmath379 over the sphere is the same for all symmetric states .",
    "therefore a bunching of the mps in a small area of the sphere would lead to high values of @xmath379 in that area , thus lowering the entanglement .",
    "this explains the tendency of mps to spread out as far as possible , as it is seen for the classical problems .",
    "however , there also exist highly entangled states where two or more mps coincide ( as seen for @xmath380 ) .",
    "this is intriguing because such configurations are the least optimal ones for classical problems .",
    "again , this can be explained with the constant integration volume of @xmath379 .",
    "because of latexmath:[$g(\\sigma)^2 \\propto \\prod_i    @xmath379 are the diametrically opposite points ( antipodes ) of the mps and therefore a lower number of _ different _ mps leads to a lower number of zeros in @xmath379 .",
    "this can lead to the integration volume being more evenly distributed over the sphere , thus yielding a higher amount of entanglement .    excluding the dicke states with their infinite amount of cpps",
    ", one observes that highly entangled states tend to have a large number of cpps .",
    "the prime example for this is the case of five qubits , where the classical solution with only three cpps is less entangled than the ` square pyramid ' state that has five cpps . in theorem [ maj_max_pos_zero ]",
    "it was shown that @xmath228 is an upper bound on the number of cpps of positive symmetric @xmath0 qubit states .",
    "for all of our numerically determined maximally entangled states  including the non - positive ones  this bound is obeyed , and for most states the number of cpps is close to the bound ( @xmath382 ) or coincides with it ( @xmath383 ) .",
    "this raises the question whether this bound also holds for general symmetric states . to date , neither proof nor counterexample is known .    when viewing the @xmath0 mps of a symmetric state as the edges of a polyhedron , euler s formula for convex polyhedra yields the upper bound @xmath228 on the number of faces .",
    "this bound is strict if no pair of mps coincides and all polyhedral faces are triangles .",
    "intriguingly , this bound is the same as the one for cpps mentioned in the previous paragraph , and the polyhedral faces of our numerical solutions come close to the bound ( @xmath384 ) or coincide with it ( @xmath385 ) .",
    "the faces of the polyhedron associated with the majorana representation might therefore hold the key to a proof for @xmath228 being the upper bound on the number of cpps for all symmetric states ( with only the dicke states excluded ) .",
    "the case of ten qubits seems to be the first one where the maximally entangled symmetric state can not be cast as a positive state . for @xmath386 ,",
    "our candidates for maximal entanglement are real states , so the question remains whether the maximally entangled state can always be cast with real coefficients .",
    "we consider this unlikely , firstly because of the higher amount of mp freedom in the general case and secondly because many of the solutions to the classical problems can not be cast as real mp distributions for higher @xmath0 . for thomson s problem ,",
    "the first distribution without any symmetry ( and thus no representation as a real state ) arises at @xmath387 , and for tth s problem at @xmath159 .",
    "upper and lower bounds on the maximal entanglement of symmetric states have already been discussed in section [ positive_and_symm ] , with a new proof for the upper bound given in appendix [ normalization_bloch ] .",
    "stronger lower bounds can be computed from the known solutions to tth s and thomson s problems by translating their point distribution into the corresponding symmetric state and determining its entanglement .",
    "the diagram in figure [ e_graph ] displays the entanglement of our numerical solutions , together with all bounds .",
    "figure14    for @xmath388 qubits , the maximally entangled state can not be symmetric or turned into one by locc , because the lower bound on general states is higher than the upper bound of symmetric states .",
    "for @xmath389 , the maximally entangled state ( w state ) is demonstrably symmetric , but for @xmath390 the numerical solutions for symmetric states have less entanglement than the lower bound of general states .",
    "this would imply that @xmath0 qubit maximally entangled states can be symmetric if , and only if , @xmath391 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the maximally entangled state among symmetric quantum states of @xmath0 qubits . by visualizing symmetric states through the majorana representation and with the help of analytical and numerical methods , strong candidates for the maximally entangled symmetric states of up to 12 qubits",
    "were found . a comparison with the extremal distributions of tth s and thomson s problems shows that , in some cases , the optimal solution to majorana s problem coincides with that of the two classical problems , but in other cases it significantly differs .    lower and upper bounds show that the maximal entanglement of permutation - symmetric qubit states scales between @xmath392 and @xmath393 with the number of qubits @xmath0 . with respect to mbqc ,",
    "these results indicate that , although permutation - symmetric states may not be good resources for deterministic mbqc , they may be good for stochastic approximate mbqc @xcite .",
    "it also gives bounds on how much information can be discriminated locally , for which explicit protocols are known in some cases ( in particular for dicke states ) @xcite .",
    "we remark that , due to the close relationship of distance - like entanglement measures @xcite , the results for the geometric measure give bounds to the robustness of entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement , which can be shown to be tight in certain cases of high symmetry @xcite .",
    "we finally note that a similar study has been carried out , although from a different perspective , in search of the ` least classical ' state of a single spin-@xmath31 system @xcite ( which they call the ` queens of quantumness ' ) . there",
    "the majorana representation is used to display spin-@xmath31 states , through the well - known isomorphism between a single spin-@xmath31 system and the symmetric state of @xmath394 spin-@xmath80 systems . in this context",
    ", the most ` classical ' state is the spin coherent state , which corresponds exactly to a symmetric product state in our case ( i.e. @xmath0 coinciding mps ) .",
    "the problem of @xcite is similar to ours in that they look for the state ` furthest away ' from the set of spin coherent states .",
    "however , different distance functions are used , so the optimization problem is subtly different and again yields different solutions .",
