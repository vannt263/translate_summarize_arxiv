    "ever since the publication of @xcite s _ theory of games and economic behavior _ in 1944 , coalitions have played a central role within game theory .",
    "the crucial questions in coalitional game theory are which coalitions can be expected to form and how the members of coalitions should divide the proceeds of their cooperation . traditionally the focus has been on the latter issue , which led to the formulation and analysis of concepts such as gillie s core , the shapley value , or the bargaining set . which coalitions are likely to form is commonly assumed to be settled exogenously , either by explicitly specifying the coalition structure , a partition of the players in disjoint coalitions , or , implicitly , by assuming that larger coalitions can invariably guarantee better outcomes to its members than smaller ones and that , as a consequence , the grand coalition of all players will eventually form .    the two questions , however , are clearly interdependent : the individual players payoffs depend on the coalitions that form just as much as the formation of coalitions depends on how the payoffs are distributed .",
    "_ coalition formation games _ , as introduced by @xcite , provide a simple but versatile formal model that allows one to focus on coalition formation as such . in many situations",

    "hedonic games_.    the main focus in hedonic games has been on notions of _ stability _ for coalition structures such as nash stability , individual stability , contractual individual stability , or core stability and characterizing conditions under which they are guaranteed to be non - empty ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the most prominent examples of hedonic games are two - sided matching games in which only coalitions of size two are admissible  @xcite .",
