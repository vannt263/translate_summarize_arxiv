    "the lowest order cross section for @xmath2 in units of the lowest - order qed cross section for @xmath3 is defined as @xmath1 , namely @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "presently the uncertainty in @xmath1 in the energy region below 5 gev dominates the uncertainties in both @xmath6 , the qed running coupling constant evaluated at the z pole , and @xmath7 , the value of @xmath8 based on the standard model calculation  @xcite .",
    "hadron production from @xmath9 annihilation is one of the most valuable testing grounds for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "particularly , it is interesting and important to analyze low energy @xmath9 collision data , for example , the inclusive momentum spectrum , defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the momentum of the charged particles and center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy respectively , with today s knowledge .",
    "a purely analytical approach giving quantitative predictions for @xmath13 is the qcd calculation using the so - called modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla )  @xcite under the assumption of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite , which expresses the limiting spectrum for hadrons as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is an overall normalization factor describing hadronization and @xmath16 is a complex function of @xmath13 and effective scale parameter @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "1 . is valid in the range of @xmath18 .",
    "another example is the second binomial moments , which is a measure of the strength of hadron - hadron correlations and a sensitive probe for higher order qcd or non - perturbative effect .",
    "it is defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the charged particle multiplicity . according to the next leading order qcd calculation ( nlo ) ,",
    "@xmath21 is given by    @xmath22    with @xmath23 for five ( three ) active flavors .",
    "there has been a long standing discrepancy between the value of @xmath21 calculated by nlo and that measured with @xmath9 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 experiments . in addition , there is relatively little data in the energy region below 5 gev to compare with qcd calculations .",
    "this paper presents the final results of the @xmath1 values measured with besii  @xcite at bepc in the energy region from 2 - 5 gev .",
    "we also report preliminary results on the inclusive momentum spectra , the momentum distribution of charged particles , and second binomial moments @xmath21 obtained from the analysis of @xmath1 scan data .",
    "refs .  @xcite describe in detail the @xmath1 scan performed by bes at 91 energy points between 2 - 5 gev , and the experimental study of the background , particularly the beam associated background .",
    "the triggers and the determination of the trigger efficiency ; the measurement of luminosity ; the hadronic event selection and background subtraction ; the determination of the detection efficiency for hadronic events ; and the initial state radiative correction can be also found in refs .",

    "[ fig : besr ] , together with those measured by marki  @xcite , @xmath26  @xcite and pluto  @xcite . the @xmath1 values from besii have an average uncertainty of about 6.6% , which represents a factor of two to three improvement in precision in the 2 to 5 gev energy region .",
    "these improved measurements have a significant impact on the global fit to the electroweak data and the determination of the sm prediction for the mass of the higgs particle  @xcite .",
    "in addition , they are expected to provide an improvement in the precision of the calculated value of @xmath7 , and test the qcd sum rules down to 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath13 spectrum at five different energies between 2.6 and 4.8 gev are shown in figure  [ comxi ] .",
    "the errors in the spectrum include errors from hadronic event selection and uncertainties from the event generators .",
    "the momentum spectra at the five energy points are shown in figure  [ dnall ] , together with those measured at higher energy up to 130 gev in other experiments .",
    "the momentum spectra show that hadron production at very small momentum @xmath27 gev is approximately energy independent .",
    "this behavior has been explained in ref .",
    "@xcite to be due to the coherent emission of low energetic ( i. e. long wavelength ) gluons by the total color current .",
    "correspondingly the number of produced hadrons at small momentum is approximately constant .",
    "based on the multiplicity measured , we can obtain the second binomial moment @xmath21 . the results are displayed in figure [ r2bes ] , together with both nlo calculations and published data at higher energies up to 100 gev from @xmath9 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 experiments  @xcite .",
    "our measured @xmath21 , although with large errors , are consistent with those of other measurements done at higher energies .",
    "it s interesting to see that @xmath21 predicted by lo qcd are significantly higher than the measured data , while the nlo calculation comes closer to the data , although disagreement ( @xmath28 in @xmath21 ) remains sizeable ."
