    "magnetic flux , in the form of large flux tubes , emerges to the surface  presumably from near the base of the convection zone ( where the dynamo process is believed to be taking place)and responsible for sunspots and other solar active phenomena ( see rosner and weiss , 1992 ; gough , 2010 ) .",
    "a sunspot lasts from a few hours to several weeks .",
    "the typical sizes of sunspots range from  10 msh ( millionth of the solar hemisphere @xmath3 km@xmath4 ) to @xmath5 msh . although individual sunspots are common , the majority of sunspots are parts of groups .",
    "spot groups are often large and complex .",
    "the daily area of a spot ( or spot group ) is one of the most important parameters used to describe the spot ( or spot group ) development .",
    "the area of a spot ( or spot group ) is closely connected with the magnetic flux of the spot ( or spot group ) ( 130 msh area @xmath6 mx magnetic flux , @xmath7 , see wang and sheeley , 1989 ) .",
    "that is , the development of the spot ( or spot group ) area reflects the development of the solar magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the increase / decrease in the areas of spots or spot groups , @xmath8 , the growth / decay of spots or spot groups , can affect significantly the strength , configuration and topology of the magnetic structure in the solar atmosphere .",
    "hence , the studies of growth and decay of sunspots or sunspot groups are important for understanding configuration and topology of the magnetic structure on the solar surface , the solar variability and the underlying mechanism of it .",
    "several such studies have been made and many characteristics of the growth and decay of the spot groups are found ( see lustig and whl , 1995 ; hathaway and choudhary , 2008 ) .",
    "howard ( 1992a,1992b ) analyzed mt .",
    "wilson sunspot and sunspot group data during 19171985 and determined many properties of the day - to - day changes in the sunspot umbral areas ( spot growth / decay ) .",
    "howard ( 1992a ) also studied the variations in the annual averages of the umbral area increases , but no systematic variations are found . in the present study",
    "we analyze a large data set of sunspot groups and attempt to detect the long - term variations in daily rates of growth and decay of sunspot groups .    in the next section",
    "we describe the methodology and the data analysis . in section  3",
    "we present the results . in section",
    "4 we draw conclusions and briefly discuss the implications of them on the long - term solar variability .",
    "here we have used the combined greenwich ( 18741976 ) and solar optical observation network ( soon ) ( 19772009 ) sunspot group data , which are taken from david hathaway s website http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtml .",
    "these data included the observation time ( the greenwich data contain the date with the fraction of the day , in the soon data the fraction is rounded to 0.5 day ) , heliographic latitude ( @xmath9 ) and longitude ( @xmath10 ) , central meridian distance ( cmd ) , and corrected umbra and whole - spot areas ( in msh ) , etc .",
    ", of the spot groups for each day of observation .",
    "the positions of the groups are geometrical positions of the centers of the groups .",
    "the greenwich data have been compiled from the majority of the white light photographs which were secured at the royal greenwich observatory and at the royal observatory , cape of good hope .",
    "the gaps in their observations were filled with photographs from other observatories , including the kodaikanal observatory , india .",
    "the soon data included measurements made by the united states air force ( usaf ) from the sunspot drawings of a network of the observatories that has included telescopes in boulder , colorado ; hawaii ; etc .",
    "david hathaway scrutinized the greenwich and soon data and produced a reliable continuous data series from 1874 up to date ( also see hathaway and choudhary , 2008 ) . in case of soon data",
    ", we increased the area by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "david hathaway found this correction was necessary to have a combined homogeneous greenwich and soon data ( see the aforementioned website of david hathaway . )",
    "the method of analysis is similar to that in howard ( 1992a ) .",
    "howard used daily umbral areas of the spots measured in mt .",
    "wilson observatory during the years 19171985 .",
    "we have used the corrected daily whole - spot areas ( umbral value + penumbral value ) of spot groups ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "a spot group is included when the observations of it are available for two or more consecutive days .",
    "the daily rate of change of the area ( @xmath12 ) of a spot group is computed using the differences between the epochs of its observation in consecutive days and between the corrected whole - spot areas of the spot group at these epochs .",
    "that is , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the epoch of observation during the life time ( @xmath15 ) of a spot group and @xmath16 2 , 3 , .... , @xmath15 .",
    "positive and negative values of @xmath12 correspond to the daily rates of growth ( @xmath17 ) and decay ( @xmath18 ) of a spot group , respectively .",
    "the percentage of growth ( % g ) and decay ( % d ) are calculated as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the mean values ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in a given time interval are calculated as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 1 , 2, ....",
    ",k and @xmath27 1 , 2, .... ,m ; k and m are the number of data points of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , in the interval .",
    "it should be noted that obviously more contributions to @xmath21 and @xmath22 are coming from the spot groups before and after reaching their maximum areas , respectively .    the data on the recurrent and the non - recurrent spot groups are combined .",
    "the first and the subsequent disc passages of the recurrent spot groups are treated as independent groups .",
    "therefore , the life time of a spot group is @xmath28 12 days . as in the case of our earlier papers ( javaraiah 2010 , and references therein ) , here we have taken the following precaution which reduces substantially the uncertainties in the derived results ( ward , 1966 ; javaraiah and gokhale , 1995 ) : we have excluded the data corresponding to the @xmath29 on any day of the spot group life span .",
    "this reduced the error due to the foreshortening effect .",
    "further , we excluded the data corresponding to the ` abnormal ' motions , @xmath7 displacements exceeding @xmath30 day@xmath1 in the longitude or @xmath31 day@xmath1 in the latitude .",
    "this reduces uncertainties in @xmath21 and @xmath22 removing those which were incorrectly identified . for the sake of readers",

    "we noticed that some daily data records , particularly in the data during recent cycles ( @xmath8 , in the soon dataset ) , contain the zeros for the whole - spot group area .",
    "we excluded all those unrealistic data records , @xmath8 , we have excluded the data correspond to the whole - spot area equal to zero in any day during the life time of the spot group , because we find that presence of these unrealistic data yields large values for the derived decay rates .",
    "we determined the variations in the mean percentage growth and decay rates ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of the spot groups in the whole disk , in the northern and the southern hemispheres , and also in the separate @xmath49 latitude intervals .",
    "the variations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the spot groups in the whole disk are determined from the yearly data and for the spot groups in a whole hemisphere the variations are determined by binning the data into 3- and 4-year moving time intervals ( mtis ) that are successively shifted by one year during the period 19742009 , for the sake of better statistics . in case of the separate @xmath49 latitude intervals , we have used only 4-year mtis because in a shorter than 4-year interval the data are found to be inadequate and the error bars are very large to plot the results , particularly during the cycles minima .",
    "the yearly as well as 3- and 4-mtis time series of @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been corrected by replacing those values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 whose standard errors exceeded the 2.6 times ( correspond to 99% confidence level ) the corresponding median values with the average of the corresponding values and their respective two neighbors ( in case of the beginnings of the time series it is the average of the values in the intervals 1 and 2 and in the endings it is the average of the values in the intervals @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where n is the size of the series ) .",
    "we determined the periodicities in @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the fast fourier transform ( fft ) power spectrum analysis of the corrected time series .",
    "the values of the periodicities are determined from the maximum entropy method ( mem ) .",
    "the time - dependencies in the periodicities in @xmath21 and @xmath22 are checked using morlet wavelet analysis .",
    "the mem and the wavelet analyses of @xmath21 and @xmath22 were carried out in a similar way as in the analyses of the mean meridional motions of the spot groups by javaraiah ( 2010 ) and are briefly described below .",
    "the lengths of the time series are inadequate to measure precisely the values of @xmath52 11-year periodicities in @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the fft analysis .",
    "hence , the uncertainties in the longer periodicities determined here from the fft analysis are large .",
    "a different approach for determining the periodicities in a short time series with a higher accuracy is to compute the power spectrum using mem .",
    "mem analysis is a parametric modeling approach to the estimation of the power spectrum of a time series .",
    "the method is data adaptive being used upon an autoregressive modeling process .",
    "an important step in this method is the optimum selection of the order @xmath53 of the autoregressive process , which is the number of immediately previous points that have been used in the calculation of a new point .",
    "if @xmath53 is chosen too low the spectrum is over - smoothed and the high resolution potential is lost . if @xmath53 is chosen too high , frequency shifting and spontaneous splitting of the spectral peaks occur .",
    "the mem code which we have used here takes the values for @xmath53 in the range ( n/3 , n/2 ) ( ulrych and bishop , 1975 ) or 2n/@xmath54(2n ) ( berryman , 1978 ) . in order to find the correct values of the periodicities found in the fft power spectrum ,",
    "we have computed mem power spectra choosing various values for m in the range ( n/3 , n/2 ) and 2n/@xmath54(2n ) .",
    "we find that @xmath55 is suitable in the present mem analysis , @xmath8 , in the derived spectra the peaks are considerably sharp and well separated .",
    "wavelet analysis provides both time - domain information and frequency - domain information simultaneously .",
    "we have used the wavelet idl code provided by ch .",
    "torrence and g. p. compo as described in torrence and compo ( 1998 ) .",
    "morlet wavelet consists of a complex exponential modulated by a gaussian , @xmath56 , where @xmath14 is the time , @xmath57 is the wavelet scale , and @xmath58 is a non - dimensional frequency . a good temporal resolution is required to localize the power maxima in time and a good frequency resolution is required to determine the corresponding frequencies . a narrow ( in time )",

    "the 10-year difference between the periods of these cycles might have caused a few year phase catastrophe and responsible for the weak correlation .",
    "there is no correlation ( values are very small , 6%12% ) either between @xmath21 and @xmath76 or between @xmath22 and @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 is considerably large in the declining phases of some solar cycles and @xmath22 is considerably large in the rising phases of some cycles ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "therefore , the relation between the sunspot activity and the evolution rates of the spot groups is not clear . on the other hand",
    ", the different types of cycles of the sub - century and the century time scales may be dominant in indices of different types of activity ( komitov @xmath78 , 2010 ) .",
    "subsurface and surface flows may be responsible for the growth and the decay of the spot groups ( active regions in general ) .",
    "it may be interesting to note that the correlation between the powerful flare events and sunspot number is weak and a significant 5060-year periodicity seems to be highly pronounced in the powerful flare - related data ( komitov @xmath78 , 2010 ) .",
    "evolution of sunspot groups may be related to the cancelation / enhancement of the subsurface / surface magnetic flux due to the reconnection process , which seems to be the main mechanism of solar flare activity .",
    "hence , the long - term variations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 may be related to the corresponding long - term variations in the powerful flare events .",
    "although over the 12 cycles the values of the correlations between @xmath21 and @xmath76 , and between @xmath22 and @xmath76 , are small , in figure  7 there is a suggestion that the increasing / decreasing trends of both @xmath21 and @xmath22 during 34 cycles are related to the mean @xmath76 of the corresponding cycles , which is lower / greater than the mean @xmath76 of the 12 cycles .",
    "in addition , the @xmath05560-year cycle looks to be superposed ( particularly in the case of @xmath21 ) on a much stronger cycle of @xmath0 120-year ( with minima at cycles  12 and 23 ) . in this context",
    "it may be worth to note that the length of the current gleissberg cycle is also substantially long , @xmath79 years ( javaraiah , bertello , and ulrich , 2005 ) .",
    "these trends in @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicate that both these parameters will slightly increase during the next 23 cycles and the behavior may be similar to the corresponding trends of @xmath21 and @xmath22 during cycle 1215 .",
    "since , cycles  1215 are on the average weak cycles , hence the next few cycles may be weak cycles .",
    "this inference is also consistent with the following suggestions : ( i ) the violation of the g - o rule by cycle pair 22,23 might be followed by a few weak cycles ( javaraiah , 2005 ) ; ( ii ) now the level of activity may correspond to the declining phase of the current gleissberg cycle ( javaraiah , bertello , and ulrich , 2005 ) ; and ( iii ) a small amplitude predicted for solar cycle  24 ( javaraiah , 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "we find the high correlations 69% and 74% between the northern and the southern hemisphere @xmath21 and @xmath22 shown in figure  3 , respectively , suggesting that the long - term variations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 are closely symmetric about the sun s equator .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  3 , the phases of the variations of @xmath21 in the northern and the southern hemispheres seem to be opposite during each of the cycles  1719 .",
    "in fact , we obtained -74% correlation from 20 pairs of data points of @xmath21 correspond to the time number interval 6584 , @xmath8 , between around the maximum epochs of cycles  17 and 19 . on the other hand , in the recent four cycles there is no north - south asymmetry in @xmath21 , indicating that a high coherence in the variations of @xmath21 of the northern and the southern hemispheres is associated with reduced amplitude of a 3344-year cycle ( may be due to equatorial crossing of the magnetic flux in the convection zone ) .",
    "thus , the strength of a 3344-year cycle in the solar activity may be related to the strength of the north - south asymmetries in @xmath21 during the 11-year solar cycles that comprise the 3344-year cycle in activity .",
    "there is no north - south asymmetry in @xmath22 throughout the period 18742009 , except during cycle  17 .",
    "figures  812 show the fft and the mem power spectra of the variations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 shown in figures  24 ( the last few years data have not been used in case of all the time series of the 4-year mtis , because their inclusion found to distort the low frequency sides of the corresponding mem spectra ) .",
    "it should be noted that as the size of the time - interval increased the peaks at high frequencies are washed - out .",
    "therefore , only low frequency sides of the spectra are shown in figures  912 . however ,",
    "the 95% significant levels of the peaks in the fft spectra are determined by considering only the power at these low frequencies .",
    "( note : the spectra which correspond to the @xmath80 latitude interval are less reliable due the scarcity of the data in many 4-year time - intervals . )",
    "most of these spectra show the existence of a 6080-year periodicity in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with the corresponding peaks in the fft spectra are about 95% confidence level .",
    "( the mem spectra of the yearly data of @xmath21 and @xmath22 yield the values 59-year and 71-year , respectively , for the 6080-year periodicity . ) in addition , the following peaks at frequencies which are close to the solar cycle frequency are significant on @xmath52 95% confidence level : ( i ) the peak at frequency @xmath0 0.1 year@xmath1 in the fft spectra of both @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath2 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere ( see figure  10(b ) ) ; and ( ii ) the peak at frequency @xmath0 0.055 year@xmath1 in the fft spectrum of @xmath22 of @xmath80 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere ( see figure  12(a ) ) .",
    "these results suggest that the periodicities which are close to the solar cycle period are time and latitude dependent .",
    "figure  13 shows the wavelet spectra of the corrected time series shown in figure  2 .",
    "the lengths of the time series are inadequate to resolve the temporal dependency of 6080-year periodicity .",
    "the periodicities of @xmath22 which are close to the solar - cycle period seem to have occurred during the period 19001920 and around the period 19751995 .",
    "a 78-year periodicity in @xmath21 and also in @xmath81 seems to occur during the period 19601980 .",
    "a @xmath0 5-year periodicity in @xmath22 occurred around 1900 .",
    "hathaway and chowdhury ( 2008 ) noted that the solar cycle variation in the decay rates of the spot groups is merely coming from the latitude - time distribution of the spot groups .",
    "the existence of a 90-year cycle is also found in the widths of the butterfly diagram ( pulkkinen @xmath78 , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , one can suspect that the long - term ( @xmath0 60-year ) periodicity found here in @xmath82 and @xmath22 may also be artifacts of the long - term variations in the width of the butterfly wings .",
    "on the other hand , in figures  4 and 5 we can see that all the above said properties in the variations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are present in each of the @xmath49 latitude intervals , though the patterns are not as well defined as those of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a whole hemisphere .",
    "however , a large contribution to the 6080-year variations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 of a whole hemisphere is came from the corresponding variations in the @xmath83 latitude interval ( see figure  11 ) .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from the above analysis :    1 .   the minimum and the maximum values of the annual mean growth rates of the spot groups are @xmath052% day@xmath1 and @xmath0183% day@xmath1 , respectively , whereas the corresponding values of the annual mean decay rates are @xmath021% day@xmath1 and @xmath044% day@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the average value ( over the period 18742009 ) of the daily growth rate is about 70% more than that of the decay rate .",
    "the growth and the decay rates vary by about 35% and 13% , respectively , on a 60-year time scale .",
    "3 .   a @xmath0 11-year periodicity in the growth and the decay rates",
    "is found to be highly latitude and time dependent and seems to exist in both the growth and the decay rates of the spot groups mainly in the @xmath2 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere .",
    "4 .   from the beginning of cycle  23 the growth rate",
    "is substantially decreased and near the end ( 20072008 ) the growth rate is lowest in the past about 100 years . in the extended part ( beyond the length of the declining part of a normal cycle ) of the declining phase of this cycle ,",
    "the decay rate steeply increased and it is largest in the beginning of the current cycle  24 .",
    "these unusual properties of the growth and the decay rates during cycle  23 may be related to the very long declining phase of this cycle with the unusually deep and prolonged current minimum .",
    "the strength of the known approximate 3344 year modulation in solar activity seems to be related to the strength of the north - south asymmetry in the growth rate during the 11-year solar cycles that comprise the 3344 year cycle in activity .",
    "6 .   decreasing and increasing trends in the growth and",
    "the decay rates indicate that the next 23 solar cycle will be relatively weak .    the conclusions  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above , @xmath8 ,",
    "the lower decay rate and its slow evolution support the idea of a long - term persistence of the solar activity .",
    "this is consistent with an hypothesis of some class of turbulent dynamo models ( dikpati and gilman , 2006 ) , although the present analysis ( conclusion 6 , above ) does not support the large amplitude for the current cycle  24 that is predicted in these models .",
    "the existence of a quasi - periodic long - term variation ( gleissberg cycle ) in solar activity is well known . however ,",
    "a wide range of values ( 50130 years ) are suggested for gleissberg cycle . among them",
    "the existence of 6080-year periodicity is frequently reported ( komitov @xmath78 , 2010 ) .",
    "the 6080-year cycles of the growth and decay rates may be related to the corresponding cycles in the powerful flare events , rather than to that of the sunspot activity ( see previous section ) .",
    "one can expect that convection has a major role in the day - to - day fluctuations of the areas of spot groups .",
    "the growth and decay of an active region may have an association with upward flow and the reverse down flow of the convection , respectively ( see also komm , howe , and hill , 2009 ) .",
    "the long - term variations in the day - to - day fluctuations in the areas of the spot groups largely represent the corresponding long - term variations in the convective flows .",
    "the long - term variation in the convection may be related to the corresponding long period global oscillation of the sun .",
