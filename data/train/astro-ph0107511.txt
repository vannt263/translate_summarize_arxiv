    "despite three decades of intensive study , the mechanism producing pulsar radio emission is poorly understood .",
    "fluctuations in the intensity of the radio radiation provide important constraints on plausible mechanisms .",
    "single - pulse studies of bright pulsars detect a variety of patterns in the intrinsic intensity fluctuations , including nulling and drifting phenomena .",
    "the distribution of integrated pulse energies , however , has only a modest dispersion , typically forming a gaussian of width @xmath4 , the mean pulse energy ( eg .",
    "manchester & taylor 1974 ) .",
    "in contrast , the crab pulsar psr b0531 + 24 emits pulses with energies @xmath5 , extending up to @xmath6 ( lundgren et  al.1995 ) which were instrumental in the original detection of the crab ( staelin & reifenstein 1968 ) .",
    "these giant pulses ( gp ) are typically broadband ( moffett 1997 , sallmen et  al.1999 ) and of short duration , with widths of order a few @xmath7s and structure down to 10ns ( hankins 2000 ) .",
    "they are localized to the main and interpulse phase windows and follow an intensity distribution best characterized as a power law with index of @xmath8 .    the discovery of similar pulses from the millisecond pulsar psr b1937 + 214 ( sallmen & backer 1995 , cognard et  al.1996 ) was surprising .",
    "the pulses are extremely short ( @xmath9s ) events confined to small phase windows trailing the main and inter- pulses , again with an approximately power - law distribution of pulse energies ( kinkhabwala & thorsett 2000 ) .",
    "since psr b1937 + 214 is the only known radio pulsar having an estimated magnetic field at the light cylinder larger than that of the crab , it has been suggested that this is a key parameter controlling the giant pulse phenomenon ( cognard et  al.1996 ) .",
    "johnston et  al.(2001 ) have recently found that the vela pulsar produces pulses with a very wide distribution of peak fluxes .",
    "it is not clear if these events are related to true giant pulses ; the largest such pulses observed to date have @xmath10 , but these narrow pulses have peak fluxes exceeding @xmath11 the integrated peak intensity .",
    "relatively few individual pulses have been examined , and the extended tail in the @xmath12 distribution of these ` giant @xmath7-pulses ' may continue into the true gp regime .",
    "the pulses are localized to a phase window off of the integrated pulse emission , are of short duration and are highly polarized .    to explore the connection between the crab and psr b1937 + 214 gps and the large individual pulses of @xmath13 yr vela - like pulsars",
    ", we obtained fast time sample data for several young and millisecond pulsars .",
    "we report here evidence for giant pulses in the msp with the next highest known light cylinder field , psr b1821@xmath124 , along with limits on gp emission in other high - field msps . in a companion paper ( s. johnston & r.w .",
    "romani 2001 , in preparation ) we discuss large individual pulse energies in young high field pulsars .",
    "observations were made on 20 - 22 may 2001 , with the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "we used the center beam of the 21-cm multi - beam system at an observing frequency of 1517.75 mhz .",
    "the receiver has a system equivalent flux density of 30 jy on cold sky .",
    "the back - end consisted of a filterbank containing 512 channels per polarization each of width 0.5 mhz for a total bandwidth of 256 mhz .",
    "the polarization pairs are summed , each output is then sampled at 80 @xmath7s , one - bit digitized , and written to dlt for off - line analysis .",
    "the data were then de - dispersed at the pulsar s nominal dispersion measure . the mean and rms of groups of 8192 samples ( 0.65 s ) were examined and those which showed obvious signs of interference were discarded .",
    "the data could then be folded synchronously with the pulsar s topocentric period to produce a pulse profile .",
    "our nominal 5-@xmath14 sensitivity in 80 @xmath7s is 1.3 jy . in practice ,",
    "even after clipping , we experienced substantially larger background fluctuations and the rms exceeded our expected rms by a factor of 1.5 - 3 .    to confirm that we could detect conventional gps we made short observations of the crab pulsar , during which gps were detected with high significance .",
    "short integrations with the vela pulsar off - axis , producing an effective continuum flux of only 0.6 mjy , confirmed that we could detect the largest individual vela - type giant @xmath7-pulses at these faint continuum flux levels .",
    "finally , and most relevant to the present study we observed psr b1937 + 214 , obtaining 1784s of integration ( @xmath15 pulses ) .",
    "our sampling provides only 19 bins across the pulse profile , but we clearly detect the gp distributions in both the main and interpulse components . in both components",
    "the giant pulse peaks occur approximately one bin after the corresponding peak of the integrated pulse profile .",
    "the largest main component gp obtained had an energy 445 jy@xmath7s , the third largest had 230 jy@xmath7s .",
    "the phasing and intensity distribution are well matched to the 1.4 ghz results reported by kinkhabwala & thorsett ( 2000 ) .",
    "upper panel : the peak flux of the brightest pulses with adjacent bins @xmath16 , points at the peak phase . our integrated profile ( arbitrary scale ) is overplotted for reference ; 1.2 periods are shown .",
    "lower panel : integrated energy of the brightest gp .",
    "we label the components on the reference pulse profile and mark ( at top ) the 4-bin windows used to measure component energies . ]",
    "psr b1821@xmath124 has a period of 3.05ms and a dispersion measure ( dm ) of @xmath17 @xmath18pc .",
    "this dm leads to a smearing of 142 @xmath7s across our 0.5 mhz filter bands , limiting our resolution and ensuring that any giant pulse from the source will be smeared across 2 - 3 time samples .",
    "we obtained 3@xmath23600s of data on this pulsar starting at mjd 52049.7 ; after excision of 0.65s averages showing strong interference , we retained 9943s of data or @xmath193.3@xmath20 pulses . because of the expected dm smearing , we first searched the de - dispersed data stream by tagging pulses with 2 or more consecutive samples exceeding @xmath21 .",
    "our data contained 16 such pulses .",
    "the brightest of these , both in terms of peak sample intensity and integrated energy were confined to a narrow window in the first component of the integrated pulse profile ( figure 1 , which shows the brightest 8 pulses by each measure ) . during these observations",
    "psr b1821@xmath124 had a continuum flux of @xmath193 mjy and an average pulse energy of 9.3jy@xmath7s .",
    "the largest individual pulse observed had @xmath22 which is @xmath23 .",
    "this pulsar has a complex pulse morphology .",
    "we adopt the naming convention of backer & sallmen ( 1997 ) , in which p1 has a steep spectrum , dominating the pulse at low radio frequencies and the second narrow pulse p2 is stronger at short wavelength .",
    "the broad trailing component p3 seems to have a similar spectrum to p1 .",
    "backer & sallmen report that at 1.4 ghz the pulsar occasionally spends many hours in a mode with p2 decreased relative to the other components by a factor of 4 .",
    "we do not see such dramatic variations , but confirm that p2 is variable , decreasing in flux by 25% relative to p1 and p3 over our first hour of integration and stabilizing afterwards .",
    "( dashed line curve ) . below : the _ rxte _ pulse profile with the relative phase determined by rots et  al.(1998 ) . ]    the pulsar is also detected in the x - ray , again with a complex pulse profile .",
    "careful timing ( rots et  al.1998 ) using the _ rossi x - ray tming explorer ( rxte ) _ establishes that the narrow , hard spectrum x - ray component is associated with p1 , but lags significantly by @xmath24s . a second",
    "broad , and apparently softer , x - ray peak lags p3 by @xmath25s .",
    "figure 2 compares our integrated pulse profile and the profile obtained by averaging all 16 pulses with adjacent samples @xmath26 .",
    "these pulses have been re - sampled to common phase bins , with 38 points across the light curve ; each bin corresponds to about one original sample .",
    "the ` gp ' lightcurve p1 emission lags that of the integrated pulse profile by approximately @xmath27s ( one bin )",
    ". no other significant gp feature is seen . for comparison",
    "we plot the _ rxte _ light curve of rots et  al .",
    ", with the relative phasing determined in that study . dm smearing and re - sampling to fixed phase windows can fully account for our gp pulse width .",
    "thus our gp emission appears to be unresolved in phase and coincident with the hard power law high energy pulse .",
    "we can obtain some further information on the gp distribution by measuring pulse intensity distributions in windows of pulse phase .",
    "for each pulse we defined a 10 sample off pulse window ( @xmath28 = 0.63 - 0.85 in figure 1 ) .",
    "the individual components were estimated by the three 4-sample windows indicated in figure 1 ( p1=@xmath10.03  0.05 ; p2=0.24  0.32 ; p3= 0.45  0.53 ) .",
    "for each pulse we determined the background level from the median of the samples in off pulse region of the current and preceding pulses .",
    "the individual component energy was measured by an integration of the energy in the appropriate four sample window .",
    "the cumulative histograms of the three components are shown in figure 3 .",
    "component p1 shows an appreciable excess of high energy pulses , extending somewhat below our selected giant pulse threshold .",
    "note that due to dm smearing and our limited resolution , some pulse energy will be lost from these 4-sample windows , so these @xmath12 values underestimate the full pulse energy .",
    "since only our brightest gps are well separated from the underlying pulse and noise fluctuations , we can put little constraint on their intensity distribution .",
    "power law indices of @xmath29 adequately describe the gp excess .",
    "indeed an addition of an @xmath30 power law to the p3 flux distribution nominally matches the p1 distribution quite well ( dashed smooth line ) . as for the 1.4 ghz psr b1937 + 214 data of kinkhabwala & thorsett ( 2000 ) , it is likely that noise fluctuations and normal pulses steepen the estimated power law index this close to the noise floor .",
    "longer observations with greater sensitivity will be needed to probe the true gp intensity distribution .",
    "we expect about @xmath31h ( @xmath32 ) with @xmath33 .",
    "this 1.4 ghz gp rate is , in fact , roughly twice that of psr b1937 + 214 , which has @xmath34 .",

    "we also observed four other millisecond pulsars with high inferred light cylinder magnetic fields , @xmath35 . in table 1 , in @xmath35 order , the pulsars that we observed are listed along with the mean pulse energy , number of pulses observed and the limit to which giant pulses were not seen .",
    "these four pulsars have @xmath35s substantially lower than that of psr b1821@xmath124 . for psrs",
    "j0034@xmath10534 , j2129@xmath15721 and j1911@xmath11114 , the low flux at our observation epoch precluded significant bounds on gp emission .",
    "the last entry of the table lists the factor by which a pulse must exceed @xmath36 to be detected in our study . indeed ,",
    "if the cumulative intensity distribution followed @xmath44 and the gp rate were the same as for b1821@xmath124 , we would have required @xmath45 , 58 and 18 million pulses , respectively , to see a giant pulse in these three pulsars at our achieved threshold .",
    "considering further the likely decreased gp frequency at lower @xmath35 , our limits do not significantly constrain gp emission in these sources . on the other hand , for j0613@xmath10200 ( with a similar period and flux density to psr b1821@xmath124 but @xmath35 lower by 5 )",
    ", our limits do begin to probe b1821@xmath124 -like gps .",
    "for the gp distribution assumed above with the same probability as in b1821@xmath124 , we would have expected about 15 gp events .",
    "in fact , the largest few pulses do occur in @xmath46 of phase ahead of the integrated pulse profile , suggesting that more sensitive observations might uncover a gp distribution in this source at @xmath47 the frequency of the events seen in b1821@xmath124 .",
    "the addition of b1821@xmath124 to the gp family supports the idea that large magnetic fields in the outer magnetosphere are required for this behavior .",
    "however this object points to an additional common feature : as for the crab pulsar , the gps appear isolated to narrow windows of pulse phase showing high energy pulses , with hard power law spectra . in the case of the crab these x- and @xmath48-ray pulses",
    "are believed to arise in an outer magnetosphere acceleration gap along the boundary of the open zone ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ) .",
    "these crab - type outer gaps are believed to have @xmath49 pair production maintained by a dense bath of target soft synchrotron photons from the gap itself .",
    "high @xmath3 fields ( especially near the null charge surface ) should enhance this synchrotron emissivity , and hence the rate of secondary @xmath50 production .",
    "this dense pair plasma produces the narrow hard x - ray pulses , and we can speculate that the high densities promote the instabilities that create enhancements in the particle coherence and hence the giant radio pulses .",
    "this picture provides a few predictions .",
    "psr b1937 + 214 shows narrow x - ray pulses in asca data ( takahashi et  al.2001 ) , with a phase close to the radio interpulse .",
    "we expect that a high resolution x - ray profile with good absolute radio phase comparison will show these x - ray pulses to align with the gp phase , lagging the integrated radio profile pulse peak .",
    "it is not clear why the interpulse should be stronger at high energies than the main pulse .",
    "an additional strong gp candidate not accessible to our survey is the millisecond pulsar psr j0218 + 4232 ( @xmath51 g ) .",
    "comparison with the high energy pulse profile ( kuiper et  al.2000 ) suggests that gp emission may be found in the second radio pulse , and possibly in the @xmath52 mev pulse phase preceding the first radio peak .",
    "the detailed dependence of the gp frequency on @xmath35 is not clear .",
    "if the critical quantity is the field near the outer gap base at the null charge surface , where pair production is expected to be most intense , then magnetic inclination @xmath53 can have a strong effect with @xmath54 ^ 6 $ ] for a static dipole field and @xmath55 .",
    "consider the case of the crab pulsar , which has a frequency of @xmath56 pulses roughly @xmath57 larger than that of psr b1937 + 214 or psr b1821@xmath124 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "polarization modeling ( romani and yadigaroglu 1995 ) and the recent cxo wind torus images suggest that the crab has @xmath58 . baker and sallmen ( 1997 ) found a plausible polarization sweep fit of @xmath59 for psr b1821@xmath124 .",
    "for this angle the nominal field at the base of the gap is suggestively @xmath60 lower than that of the crab .",
    "of course , the magnetosphere of a msp is likely far from vacuum dipole , but this does underline that @xmath53 can have a strong effect on the ordering of gp candidates by @xmath3 .    a better criterion for the presence of strong gp activity may be the presence of a narrow hard spectrum x - ray pulse , indicating a dense pair plasma in an active outer gap .",
    "most known , young @xmath48-ray pulsars are vela - like with pair production controlled by thermal surface fluxes ( e.g. romani 1996 )",
    ". these do have non - thermal x - ray pulse components , but these are much broader and the emission represents a much smaller fraction of the spindown luminosity .",
    "gp distributions might therefore be much weaker in these pulsars .",
    "the occurrence of gp in other young crab - like pulsars and the connection with the large pulses from millisecond pulsars described here can only be addressed by further sensitive single pulse studies .",
    "the parkes telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
