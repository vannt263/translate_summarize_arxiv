    "the rise of m2 m communications introduced necessity for efficient random access mechanisms , motivating new research approaches that put novel views on the traditional solutions , such as the slotted aloha ( sa ) .",
    "one of the promising directions in this respect is the use of successive interference cancellation ( sic ) in the slotted aloha framework , which enables to exploit collisions and thereby boost the throughput .",
    "the use of sic in framed sa@xcite was originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "a systematic treatment of the concept was presented in the seminal paper by liva  @xcite , where the analogies between sic in framed sa and iterative belief - propagation ( bp ) decoding or erasure - correcting codes were identified .",
    "this opened the possibility to use the theory and tools of codes - on - graphs , laying the foundations of the coded random access .",
    "the ideas of coded random access in a setting with framed sa were further developed in @xcite , where the main message is that the use of sic , coupled with a proper access strategy , grants a throughput that tends to 1 asymptotically i.e. , when number of users @xmath0 .",
    "the application of coded random access in the original slotted aloha framework  @xcite , where the users perform access on a slot basis , rather than on a frame basis , was proposed in @xcite , introducing the approach of frameless aloha .",
    "the operation of frameless aloha is inspired by rateless codes @xcite : the slots are `` added '' to the contention process until the base station decides to terminate the contention ; the contention termination criterion can be based , for example , on throughput maximization . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a simple version of the scheme , where the users access the slots with probability that is uniform both over users and slots , leads to throughput values that are the highest in the reported literature for practical number of users in the range @xmath1 $ ] .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only reference to the capture effect in the literature on coded slotted aloha was made in @xcite , which presents a general modification of the and - or tree evaluation . ]",
    "@xcite that takes into account the capture effect . in this paper",
    "we make several steps forward .",
    "first , we present a detailed treatment of the capture effect in coded slotted aloha , providing a systematic approach for the actual computation of the expressions that constitute the and - or tree evaluation , as compared to @xcite .",
    "we apply the derived analysis to the rayleigh fading scenario in frameless aloha and show that higher throughput can be achieved in comparison to the simplest communication model that has no capture effect .",
    "we also perform a simulation - based study and demonstrate that the capture effect can be exploited to improve the throughput in the non - asymptotic case .",
    "the organization of the rest of the text is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] briefly introduces the concepts of the coded slotted aloha and capture effect .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] provides the system model .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] presents a detailed derivation of the and - or tree evaluation that takes into account capture effect , and instantiates it for the case of rayleigh fading and frameless aloha .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents both analytical and simulation - based results , while section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "a toy example illustrating the principles of coded sa ( i.e. , sic - enabled sa ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "the nodes on the left represent users , the nodes on the right represent slots , and the edges connect users with slots in which their respective transmissions take place .",
    "all transmissions made by a user are replicas of the same packet ; we assume that every transmission includes pointers to all other replicas .    in its simplest form , when there is no capture effect , sic proceeds as follows .",
    "first , the slots containing a single transmission , referred to as _ singleton slots _ , are identified and corresponding transmissions recovered . in the depicted example , fig .",
    "[ fig : graph]a ) , @xmath2 is a singleton slot and the packet of user @xmath3 is recovered from it . in the next step , using pointers from the recovered transmissions , the slots that contain replicas are identified and the corresponding transmissions removed , i.e. , the interference caused by them is canceled .",
    "this may result in new singleton slots , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph]b ) , where @xmath4 becomes a singleton slot .",
    "the above procedure iterates in the same way , until there are no new singleton slots , or all user transmissions have been recovered .",
    "we note that the described procedure is completely analogous to the iterative bp erasure decoding , where the left nodes represent the original data symbols , the right nodes represent the xor - encoded symbols , while an edge from a data symbol to an encoded symbol means that the data symbol is xor - ed within the encoded symbol .",
    "the sic algorithm with capture effect is executed in a similar way .",
    "a crucial difference is that , instead operating only on singleton slots , the algorithm also exploits slots where the capture effect takes place .",
    "specifically , both in the initial step and in the subsequent iterations , new user transmissions are recovered from : 1 ) singleton slots , or slots that become singletons due to the interference cancellation , or 2 ) collision slots , including those that remain collision slots after interference cancellation , in which the capture effect occurs , as explained in the next subsection .",
    "note that this feature introduced by the capture effect is not present in the analogous code - on - graph with xor - encoded symbols , as in such analogy the decoding is limited only to singleton slots .",
    "when multiple users contend simultaneously for the same slot in sa , it is assumed by default that all transmitted signals in the slot fail to be received due to the collision .",
    "however , the capture effect may take place , that is , the strongest received signal may be successfully received despite the presence of interfering signals from other users in the same slot . the capture effect in sa",
    "related literature has been considered extensively , see@xcite .",
    "a typical premise is that a capture can be enabled by having different power levels for different received packets .",
    "these differences are results of propagation phenomena , such as fading , shadowing and the near - far effect . stated more formally , the capture effect occurs when the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) is larger than a predefined threshold , called capture ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the actual value of the capture ratio depends on the coding / modulation used in a particular system . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the capture effect is applicable both in narrowband ( @xmath6 ) and broadband ( @xmath7 ) systems .",
    "the random distribution of the signal powers at the receiver and the sinr criterion to determine the capture probability have been considered in a number of works , like @xcite .",
    "the capture effect can be applied both in multi - packet reception ( mpr ) and sic enabled receivers .",
    "typically , the mpr is implemented in broadband systems , where @xmath8 , such as e.g. spread - spectrum systems . on the other hand , sic is used in conventional narrowband systems , where @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we focus on the latter , narrowband scenario , as an appropriate setting for m2 m communications .",
    "we also note that a typical assumption is that the sic is performed only on the signals received in the same slot , i.e. , intra - slot sic @xcite .",
    "however , the design features of coded sa allow both for intra- and inter - slot sic , i.e. , the interfering signals are removed from all slots where the repeated transmissions take place , thus `` unlocking '' all the slots where the capture effect can be exploited again .",
    "we consider a scenario in which @xmath10 users contend for the access to the base station ( bs ) , where @xmath10 is assumed known at the bs .",
    "the contention period is divided into @xmath11 slots of equal - duration , where @xmath11 is not a priori fixed value .",
    "the bs starts and terminates the contention period by sending the beacon ; we assume that the duration of the beacon is one slot . for each slot",
    ", each user decides whether to transmit or not randomly , with a predefined probability termed slot access probability @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is broadcast by the bs through the beacon that is used to initiate contention and is set to : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a suitably chosen parameter , subject to optimization .",
    "note that @xmath12 is the same for all users and constant for all slots . despite its simplicity , this approach yields exceptionally good results , as verified in @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath15 the @xmath16-th user , @xmath17 , and by @xmath18 the @xmath19-th slot of the contention period , @xmath20 .",
    "further , denote by @xmath21 the number of transmission that @xmath15 performs during the contention period and by @xmath22 the number of colliding transmissions in slot @xmath18 .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to @xmath21 and @xmath22 as user and slot degrees , respectively . from",

    "the bs stores all received slots ( i.e. , the received composite signals ) and after each received slot , performs sic until there are no new degree one slots , or higher degree slots that are exploitable due to the capture effect , as explained in section  [ sec : csa ] .",
    "the above process is repeated until the bs terminates the contention period by sending a new beacon ; this effectively and a posteriori determines the value of @xmath11 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume a perfect sic , i.e. , there is no residual interference power remaining after sic is performed .",
    "finally , we introduce the criterion for contention termination .",
    "denote by : @xmath38 instantaneous fraction of resolved users and instantaneous throughput respectively , where @xmath39 is number of resolved users ( the term + 1 in the denominator of takes into account the slot used for the beacon transmission ) .",
    "the termination criterion consists of two conditions : the contention is terminated _ either _ when @xmath40 , _ or _",
    "when @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the respective thresholds , chosen such that the expected throughput @xmath44 is maximized .",
    "here we briefly treat the case when packets arrive through a frequency non - selective rayleigh fading channel , a scenario for which the results are presented section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we define @xmath45 as a random variable that represents received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of user @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath46 , and assume that @xmath45 , @xmath17 , are independent and identically exponentially distributed with mean @xmath47 : @xmath48    a user transmission is captured in slot of degree @xmath49 when its sinr is larger than a capture ratio @xmath5 , i.e. , when : @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents the user s snr , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , are snrs of the @xmath54 interfering users , and @xmath6 .",
    "the condition   can be rewritten as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the above model implies that , in the case when there are no interfering transmission ( i.e. , when @xmath58 ) , a user transmission is recovered only if @xmath59 , i.e. , the received snr has to be sufficiently high . in other words , a user transmission may not be always recovered from a degree one slot , as it is assumed in the simplified sic scenario , outlined in section  [ sec : csa ] .",
    "also , it is straightforward to show that , with rayleigh fading , the probability that a user transmission is successfully recovered from a singleton slot is : @xmath60 = e^{-\\frac{b}{\\bar{\\gamma}}}. \\label{eq : deg_one}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
