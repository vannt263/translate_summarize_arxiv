    "it is possible that this is now about to change .",
    "candidates for gluonic hadrons have recently been reported which have much in common with theoretical expectations .",
    "there are various lattice predictions for the masses of glueballs ; the most reliable is presumably for the glueball ground state , which is expected to be a scalar with a mass near @xmath19-@xmath20  gev  @xcite .",
    "a candidate for the scalar glueball has been reported at 1520 mev by the crystal barrel collaboration at lear @xcite and may also be evident in central production by na12/2@xcite at cern . possible evidence for a @xmath14 light exotic hybrid candidate has been reported in @xmath21 and @xmath22 at about 1775 mev @xcite in @xmath23 and especially @xmath24 at @xmath25 gev by ves @xcite , and in @xmath26 @xcite with a resonant phase in the region 1.6 - 2.2 gev , with production and decay characteristic similar to theoretical expectations for  hybrid \" states .",

    "if the predictions are relatively stable and what level of theoretical uncertainty is present .",
    "this paper concentrates on hybrid states , which are formed by combining a gluonic excitation with quarks .",

    "previous flux tube estimates of the hybrid spectrum made several simplifying assumptions , including a small oscillation approximation and an adiabatic separation of quark and flux tube motion @xcite . in principal",
    "these could introduce important systematic biases in the spectrum .",
    "we will present numerical results which are free of these approximations , using a hamiltonian monte carlo technique .",
    "since our results for the lightest hybrid masses are quite similar to previous analytical results , we conclude that the approximations made were reasonable , or when they did lead to important numerical inaccuracies ( such as in the adiabatic approximation and in the small oscillation approximation at small r ) the estimates of corrections to the approximations were sufficiently accurate .",
    "thus , we substantiate previous estimates of hybrid masses in the flux tube model , and we also give masses for higher hybrid excitations using our techniques .",
    "in lattice qcd widely separated static color sources are confined by approximately cylindrical regions of chaotic color fields@xcite .",
    "the flux tube model is an attempt to describe this phenomenon with a simple dynamical model , and was motivated by the strong coupling expansion of lattice qcd @xcite and by early descriptions of flux tubes as cylindrical bags of colored fields @xcite . in this model one",

    "we use a standard linear form for the string potential , @xmath92 and we usually set the string tension @xmath93 equal to @xmath94 gev / fm . for our estimates of physical hybrid masses we will augment this with a color coulomb interaction for @xmath95 in ( 2 ) .      in the flux tube studies of isgur , kokoski , merlin , and paton @xcite the combined quark and flux tube system is treated using an adiabatic approach as a zeroth order approximation . in the adiabatic analysis one",

    "solution of the schrdinger equation for the @xmath4 wavefunction in the flux tube ground state potential @xmath98 then gives the conventional @xmath4 meson spectrum in the adiabatic approximation .",

    "the hybrid mass gap apparently falls rapidly with increasing @xmath80 , so it may be difficult to find a realistic description of the spectrum with a fixed-@xmath80 flux tube model for larger @xmath80 ; the excitation energy of a many - bead string is presumably quite low relative to the @xmath148 case , assuming similar @xmath88 and @xmath93 .",
    "there are also rather subtle complications in the dynamics of the @xmath169 flux tube with fixed ends@xcite ; the constraint of transverse bead motion implies dependence of energies on the initial conditions , which must then be varied to find the lowest - lying state .",

    "as the flux tube has an orbital excitation about the @xmath4 axis , and the @xmath4 themselves have an effective centrifugal barrier due to the flux tube angular momentum , which suppresses the radial @xmath4 wavefunction at small @xmath389 , we anticipate that the @xmath385 widths @xmath390 should be significantly smaller than those of the conventional @xmath3 states @xmath18 and @xmath391 .    in light quark systems",
    "this wavefunction suppression is not dramatic ( see for example the particle data group summary of @xmath392 @xcite for @xmath5 and @xmath336 @xmath4 states following the analyses of refs@xcite ) , so we anticipate a significant light hybrid leptonic width @xmath393 .",
    "the principal difficulty here may lie in distinguishing between light conventional and hybrid vector states unambiguously .",
    "the recent analyses of the light vector sector by donnachie and kalashnikova @xcite actually do support the presence of additional vector states , some of which they suggest may be hybrids .",
    "the recent studies of hybrid decays in the flux tube model@xcite may allow tests of these possible light vector hybrids .",
    "since the @xmath394 pair in @xmath395 has @xmath396 , whereas conventional @xmath4 vector states ( either @xmath397 or @xmath398 ) have @xmath399 , there are characteristic selection rules for decays that discriminate between these spin - singlet and triplet states .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath394 are in a spin singlet ( as in the @xmath395 vector hybrid case ) then the flux tube decay model forbids decays into final states of two spin singlet mesons .    for @xmath400 states this selection rule distinguishes rather clearly between conventional and hybrid vector mesons .",
    "it implies that in the decays of a light @xmath401 hybrid @xmath402 , although @xmath403 is allowed .",
    "analogously , @xmath404 for hybrid @xmath388 @xmath405 decays ; this is opposite to the case of conventional @xmath406 @xmath4 mesons , for which the @xmath407 channel is suppressed relative to @xmath408 or @xmath409 @xcite .",
    "the extensive analysis of data in ref @xcite revealed the clear presence of a @xmath410@xcite with a strong @xmath407 mode but no evidence for @xmath408 , in accord with expectations for a hybrid .",
    "furthermore , ref@xcite finds an @xmath411 with no evidence for decays into @xmath409 , again in conflict with expectations for conventional @xmath394 @xmath412 or @xmath398 ) states but in accord with predictions for hybrid decays .",
    "the branching fractions reported for the @xmath410@xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggest that there may be mixing between @xmath401 and radial @xmath413 basis states in this region .",
    "if these hybrid states near 1.5 gev are confirmed , this mixing may explain the low mass relative to the @xmath414-@xmath415 gev typical of other hybrid candidates .",
    "there may also be significant spin - dependent mass shifts in hybrids that were not incorporated in the present study , which reduce spin - singlet masses ( such as @xmath395 ) relative to the spin triplet states ( @xmath416 ) . to test this possibility , analogous experimental investigations of @xmath388 hybrid charmonia in @xmath385",
    "would be very useful .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath417 systems the suppressed wavefunction at contact is expected to make @xmath418 hybrids essentially absent in @xmath385 annihilation .",
    "for this reason the charmonium system may be optimal for hybrid searches ; conventional @xmath419 spectroscopy is reasonably well established , and since the @xmath275-wave coupling @xmath420 is not negligible , it may be possible to observe a moderately suppressed @xmath421 vector hybrid signal in @xmath385 annihilation at a tau charm factory@xcite .",
    "diffractive photoproduction of charmonium hybrids , @xmath422 , may also be possible , for example at hera .",
    "if the mass of the @xmath421 is indeed below or near 4.3 gev ( @xmath423 threshold ) , then hadronic cascades to conventional charmonium states , in particular the @xmath424 and @xmath386 , may be important and could provide a good tag@xcite .",
    "the e835 experiment at fermilab may be able to observe production of hybrid charmonium through hadronic cascade decays to @xmath425 and @xmath426 .    for hybrids which lie above @xmath423 threshold heavy quark symmetry or detailed decay models",
    "may be used to distinguish the spin singlet @xmath381 from the spin triplet @xmath18 states through their decay systematics .",
    "more detailed theoretical study on this and related questions is now warranted .",
    "to summarize , we find that heavy - quark hybrids in the flux tube model lie below @xmath65 thresholds , and for hybrid charmonium this implies that the lightest states should have rather narrow widths .",
    "we anticipate that production by gluon jets may be particularly promising and for this case some quantitative estimates already exist@xcite based on the masses found here .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find the lightest hybrid masses in the flux tube model to be @xmath427-@xmath428 gev and @xmath429-@xmath430 gev . these results , combined with recent detailed studies of hybrid decay modes @xcite , provide a clear set of theoretical predictions for hybrids for comparison with experiment .",
