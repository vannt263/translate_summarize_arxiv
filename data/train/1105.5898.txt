    "the famous singularity theorem of penrose ( see @xcite ) states that if in addition to the dominant energy condition , the space - time has a trapped surface , namely a two dimensional space - like sphere whose outgoing and incoming expansions are negative , thus the space - time is future causally geodesically incomplete ( we usually say that the space - time contains a _ singularity _ ) . the _ weak cosmic censorship _",
    "conjecture asserts there is no naked singularity under reasonable physical assumptions .",
    "in other words , singularities need to be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "thus , by combining these two claims , if one can exhibit a trapped surface in a space - time , then one can predict the existence of black holes .",
    "in other words , although many supplementary conditions are required , we regard the existence of a trapped surface as the presence of a black hole .",
    "a major challenge in general relativity is to understand how trapped surfaces actually form due to the focusing of gravitational waves . in a recent remarkable breakthrough @xcite",
    ", christodoulou solved this long standing problem .",
    "he discovered a mechanism which is responsible for the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces in vacuum space - times . in the monograph @xcite , in addition to the minkowskian flat data on a incoming null hypersurface , christodoulou identified an open set of initial data ( this is the _ short pulse _ ansatz ) on a outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "based on the techniques developed by himself and klainerman in the proof of the global stability of the minkowski space - times @xcite , he managed to understand the whole picture of how the various estimates on geometric quantities propagates along the evolution .",
    "once those estimates are established in a large region of the space - time , the actual formation of trapped surfaces is easy to demonstrate .",
    "christodoulou also proved a version of the same result for the short pulse data prescribed on past null infinity .",
    "he showed that strongly focused gravitational waves , coming in from past null infinity , lead to a trapped surface .",
    "this miraculous work provides the first global _ large data _ result in general relativity ( without symmetry assumptions ) and opens the gate for many new developments on dynamical problems related to black holes .",
    "the methods undoubtedly have many future applications in both general relativity and other partial differential equations",
    ".    in @xcite , klainerman and rodnianski extend aforementioned result which significantly simplifies the proof of christodoulou ( from about six hundred pages to one hundred and twenty ) .",
    "they enlarge the admissible set of initial conditions and show that the corresponding propagation estimates are much easier to derive .",
    "the relaxation of the propagation estimates are just enough to guarantee that a trapped surface still forms . based on the trace estimates developed in a sequence of work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite towards the critical local well - posedness for einstein vacuum equations ,",
    "they reduce the number of derivatives needed in the argument from two derivatives on curvature ( in christodoulou s proof ) to just one .",
    "more importantly , klainerman and rodnianski introduce a parabolic scaling in @xcite which is incorporated into lebesgue norms and sobolev norms .",
    "these new techniques allow them to capture the hidden _ smallness _ of the nonlinear interactions among different small or large components of various geometric objects .",
    "the result of klainerman and rodnianski can be easily localized with respect to angular sectors which leads to further developments , see @xcite for details .",
    "we remark that klainerman and rodnianski only considered the problem on a finite region .",
    "the question from past null infinity can be solved in a similar manner as in @xcite once one understand the picture on a finite region .",
    "the problem from past null infinity has also been studied in a recent work @xcite by reiterer and trubowitz .",
    "the aforementioned works are all investigating vacuum space - times . when some matter field is presenting , the formation of black holes has attracted a lot of interest .",
    "we mention only two of them which are more related to the present paper . in @xcite , based on their work on positive mass theorem , especially the resolution of jang s equation , schoen and yau proved the existence of a trapped surface when matter is condensed in a small region , see @xcite for an improvement .",
    "their result is restricted to the initial 3-slice hence is not dynamical .",
    "another work is an earlier paper @xcite of christodoulou .",
    "he studied the evolutionary formation of singularities for the einstein - scalar field system .",
    "the radial symmetry is assumed and the mechanism of the formation of trapped surface is quite different to his most recent work @xcite . and moreover , he could get more precise information on the gravitational collapse .    the purpose of the present paper is , under the framework of christodoulou and klainerman - rodnianski , to understand the formation of charged black holes , namely the evolutionary formation of trapped surfaces when there is an electromagnetic field coupled to the background space - time . on one hand , we will generalize the black - hole - formation results of christodoulou and klainerman - rodnianski .",
    "in fact , by switching off the electromagnetic field in our main theorem , we can retrieve their results in vacuum . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that the formation of black hole can purely due to condensation of maxwell field on the initial null hypersurface , namely , we can set the incoming gravitational energy to be zero .",
