    "plasmon resonant nanoparticles have unique capabilities of enhancing the brightness of light and confining strong electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a thriving interest for optical studies of plasmon resonant nanoparticles is due to their recently proposed use as labels in molecular biology @xcite .",
    "new types of cancer diagnostic nanoparticles are constantly being developed .",
    "nanoparticles are also being used in thermotherapy as nanometric heat - generators that can be activated remotely by external electromagnetic fields @xcite .    according to the quasi - static approximation for small particles ,",
    "the surface plasmon resonance peak occurs when the particle s polarizability is maximized .",
    "plasmon resonances in nanoparticles can be treated at the quasi - static limit as an eigenvalue problem for the neumann - poincar integral operator , which leads to direct calculation of resonance values of permittivity and optimal design of nanoparticles that resonate at specified frequencies @xcite . at this limit , they are size - independent . however , as the particle size increases",
    ", they are determined from scattering and absorption blow up and become size - dependent .",
    "this was experimentally observed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , we have provided a rigorous mathematical framework for localized surface plasmon resonances .",
    "we have considered the full maxwell equations .",
    "using layer potential techniques , we have derived the quasi - static limits of the electromagnetic fields in the presence of nanoparticles .",
    "we have proved that the quasi - static limits are uniformly valid with respect to the nanoparticle s bulk electron relaxation rate .",
    "we have introduced localized plasmonic resonances as the eigenvalues of the neumann - poincar operator associated with the nanoparticle .",
    "we have described a general model for the permittivity and permeability of nanoparticles as functions of the frequency and rigorously justified the quasi - static approximation for surface plasmon resonances .    in this paper , we first prove that , as the particle size increases and crosses its critical value for dipolar approximation which is justified in @xcite , the plasmonic resonances become size - dependent . the resonance condition is determined from absorption and scattering blow up and depends on the shape , size and electromagnetic parameters of both the nanoparticle and the surrounding material .",
    "then , we precisely quantify the scattering absorption enhancements in plasmonic nanoparticles .",
    "we derive new bounds on the enhancement factors given the volume and electromagnetic parameters of the nanoparticles . at the quasi - static limit , we prove that the averages over the orientation of scattering and extinction cross - sections of a randomly oriented nanoparticle are given in terms of the imaginary part of the polarization tensor .",
    "moreover , we show that the polarization tensor blows up at plasmonic resonances and derive bounds for the absorption and scattering cross - sections .",
    "we also prove the blow - up of the first - order scattering coefficients at plasmonic resonances .",
    "the concept of scattering coefficients was introduced in @xcite for scalar wave propagation problems and in @xcite for the full maxwell equations , rendering a powerful and efficient tool for the classification of the nanoparticle shapes .",
    "using such a concept , we have explained in @xcite the experimental results reported in @xcite . finally , we consider the super - resolution phenomenon in plasmonic nanoparticles .",
    "super - resolution is meant to cross the barrier of diffraction limits by reducing the focal spot size .",
    "this resolution limit applies only to light that has propagated for a distance substantially larger than its wavelength @xcite .",
    "super - focusing is the counterpart of super - resolution .",
    "it is a concept for waves to be confined to a length scale significantly smaller than the diffraction limit of the focused waves .",
    "the super - focusing phenomenon is being intensively investigated in the field of nanophotonics as a possible technique to focus electromagnetic radiation in a region of order of a few nanometers beyond the diffraction limit of light and thereby causing an extraordinary enhancement of the electromagnetic fields . in @xcite",
    ", a rigorous mathematical theory is developed to explain the super - resolution phenomenon in microstructures with high contrast material around the source point .",
    "such microstructures act like arrays of subwavelength sensors .",
    "a key ingredient is the calculation of the resonances and the green function in the microstructure . by following the methodology developed in @xcite",
    ", we show in this paper that one can achieve super - resolution using plasmonic nanoparticles as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect1 ]",
    "we introduce a layer potential formulation for plasmonic resonances and derive asymptotic formulas for the plasmonic resonances and the near- and far - fields in terms of the size . in section [ sec - multi - scatter ]",
    "we consider the case of multiple plasmonic nanoparticles .",
    "section [ sect3 ] is devoted to the study of the scattering and absorption enhancements .",
    "we also clarify the connection between the blow up of the scattering frequencies and the plasmonic resonances .",
    "the scattering coefficients are simply the fourier coefficients of the scattering amplitude @xcite . in section [ sect4 ]",
    "we investigate the behavior of the scattering coefficients at the plasmonic resonances . in section [ sect5 ]",
    "we prove that using plasmonic nanoparticles one can achieve super resolution imaging .",
    "appendix [ append1 ] is devoted to the derivation of asymptotic expansions with respect to the frequency of some boundary integral operators associated with the helmholtz equation and a single particle .",
    "these results are generalized to the case of multiple particles in appendix [ append2 ] . in appendix [ appen2d ]",
    "we provide the technical modifications needed in order to study the shift in the plasmon resonance in the two - dimensional case . in appendix [ appendixpt ]",
