    "based upon the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics , quantum cryptography provides a technique for sharing secret cryptographic keys with unconditional security @xcite . the underlying idea of quantum cryptography ",
    "also known as quantum key distribution ( qkd )  is that the secret bits of the cryptographic key are encoded in the quantum states of photons .",
    "when the encoded photons are transmitted from one party to another , let us call them _",
    "alice _ and _ bob _ , an eavesdropper , _ evan _ , can not view the key without introducing a significant error rate . measuring the bit transmission error rate by comparing some randomly selected test bits",
    "hence allows alice and bob to verify the security of their key transmission . since the first protocol for quantum cryptography ,",
    "bb84 @xcite , many variations of it have been proposed .",
    "these aim at increasing the eavesdropping error rate , flexibility , and efficiency of qkd .",
    "for example , bennett @xcite suggested in 1992 to use two non - orthogonal two - dimensional photon states to distribute keys , thereby increasing the flexibility in the choice of states .",
    "later on , work in @xcite and @xcite introduced respectively a three - state scheme and a six - state protocol which create more difficulties for evan .",
    "the main difference between the protocol by beige _",
    "_ @xcite and earlier protocols lies in the encoding of information into quantum states . instead of encoding a whole alphabet into each basis , ref .",
    "@xcite proposes a scheme where all the vectors of the same basis encode the same letter . when optimising this strategy , a direct quantum communication protocol between alice and bob is obtained @xcite .",
    "this protocol is a qkd protocol with maximum efficiency but a relatively low error rate in case of eavesdropping .",
    "recently , khan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the same encoding to maximise intercept - resend eavesdropping error rates . in the following we refer to this protocol as kmb09 . when using two - dimensional photon states , kmb09 is essentially the same as the sarg04 protocol by scarani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with @xmath0 .",
    "brierley  @xcite increased the eavesdropping error rate of these protocols even further by allowing alice and bob to use multiple bases of more than two - dimensional photon states .",
    "this improvement comes at the cost of very low key bit transmission efficiencies .    in this paper",
    ", we design a qkd protocol with two - dimensional photon states which is characterised not only by one but _ two _ different types of errors with a distinct correlation between both of them in case of eavesdropping .",
    "more concretely , we propose a qkd protocol , where alice and bob can calculate a quantum bit error rate ( qber ) .",
    "in addition , they can exchange information about the index of the transmitted state .",
    "unexpected differences in the index are measured by the index transmission error rate ( iter ) .",
    "this combination of measures makes it much harder for evan to escape his detection .",
    "the eavesdropper not only has to minimise different types of errors .",
    "distinct correlations between the iter and the qber , ie .",
    "a distinct signature of eavesdropping , allows alice and bob to detect the origin of their errors . as a result",
    ", alice and bob can tolerate lower eavesdropping and higher system error rates without compromising their privacy .",
    "we no longer require that the error rates in case of eavesdropping unavoidably exceed the system error rate , since evan can no longer disguise his presence as system errors .",
    "this should allow alice and bob to communicate securely over much longer distances .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ kmb ] analyses the kmb09 protocol  @xcite and derives the error rates and key bit transmission efficiencies of this protocol for the case , where alice and bob use two - dimensional photon states .",
    "although this has not been emphasized in our earlier work , the kmb09 protocol is a qkd protocol with a qber and an iter .",
    "however , as we shall see below , there is no distinct correlation between these errors in case of eavesdropping .",
    "section  [ more ] therefore presents a variation of the kmb09 protocol which permits alice and bob to use not only two but three different bases .",
    "the third basis increases the flexibility of the proposed protocol which can be used to create a _ linear _ dependence between the iter and the qber in the case of intercept - resend eavesdropping .",
    "our calculations are illustrated by figures which take all possible measurement bases of evan into account and show typical values for actual realisations of the proposed protocol .",
    "we finally summarise our findings in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our first step in designing a qkd protocol with the above described features is to notice that the encoding of information used in the kmb09 protocol already results in two different types of errors : a qber and an iter . in our earlier work @xcite , we did not recognise the potential advantage of this fact and considered only the iter when designing optimal qkd protocols based on more - than - two dimensional photon states . in this section",
    "we analyse the kmb09 protocol with two - dimensional photon states in much more detail than previously done and present analytical results for the qber , the iter , and the key bit transmission efficiencies with and without eavesdropping and introduce the notation used throughout this paper .",
    "as we shall see below , in the kmb09 protocol , there are only very weak correlations between the qber and the iter .",
    "the second step in designing a qkd protocol with an improved eavesdropping detection is therefore the introduction of a variation of the original kmb09 protocol in section [ more ] .      in the case of two - dimensional photon states",
    ", the kmb09 protocol suggests that alice and bob use two bases @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 alice randomly prepares photons in the basis states of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and sends them afterwards to bob . for each incoming photon ,",
    "bob randomly selects a basis and measures its state either in _ e _ or in _ f_. after the transmission of many photons , alice publicly announces the index _",
    "i _ of each prepared state .",
    "bob compares these indices with the indices of his measurement outcomes and interprets his findings as suggested by table  [ tab : states_interpretation1 ] . for each measured photon",
    ", he obtains either 0 , 1 , or @xmath4 .",
    "these results indicate respectively whether a @xmath5 , a @xmath6 or _ no bit _ has been transmitted . under ideal conditions , it is not possible that alice and bob have different indices , when both use the same basis .",
    "a key bit is hence obtained whenever the index of the state sent by alice is different from the index measured by bob . notice that this encoding and decoding works without having to apply any constraint to the basis states of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "bob obtains a 1 , if he measures an @xmath1 state and he obtains a 0 , if he measures @xmath2 , whenever a key bit is transmitted , i.e.  when alice s and bob s indices are different .    .bob",
    "s interpretation of the measurements which he performs on the incoming photons , after alice announced the index of the transmitted state .",
    "no key bit is obtained when both have the same index , as indicated by the crosses .",
    "an error occurs when both their states have a different index although both use the same bases . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we now assume that alice and bob already agreed on a concrete set of bases @xmath7 for the preparation and the measurement of their photon states .",
    "moreover , we assume that they introduced the basis pairs @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ si ] ) and that they agreed to use the interpretation of information suggested in tables [ tab : encoding23 ] and [ tab : encoding2 ] .",
    "then their qkd protocol works as follows :    1 .",
    "alice generates a random sequence of symbols @xmath11 and assigns a random index @xmath12 to every one of them .",
    "alice then uses this sequence and the corresponding indices , prepares a sequence of photons in the respective states @xmath13 , and sends them to bob .",
    "3 .   bob measures the state of every incoming photon , thereby randomly switching his measurement basis among the three bases in * b*. 4 .",
    "afterwards , alice announces her random sequence of indices @xmath14 publicly .",
    "bob announces which photons he found in a state @xmath15 with an index @xmath16 which is different from the @xmath14 of the corresponding state @xmath13 . for each of these photons",
    ", he announces a set @xmath17 which contains his respective measurement basis .",
    "alice announces which ones of these sets contain the basis in which she prepared the respective photon .",
    "now alice and bob both know which photons transmit one key bit and interpret the corresponding photon states accordingly",
    "finally , alice and bob openly compare some quantum bits and some indices of transmitted states .",
    "this allows them to calculate their qber , their iter , and their key bit transmission efficiency .",
    "if they detect an eavesdropper , the generated cryptographic key is not secure .",
    "( [ eq : general_efh_kmb ] ) describes a way to parametrize the basis states of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath18 by three angles @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "since the qkd protocol discussed in this section requires an additional basis @xmath22 , we moreover define @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real numbers ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath26 .",
    "the qber is the ratio of the number of erroneous bits to the total number of detected bits .",
    "this means , to determine their qber , alice and bob need to select some of the transmitted bits as test bits and compare their values publicly . a closer look at the above protocol shows that the qber is closely related to the iter .",
    "the reason is that a quantum bit error occurs whenever alice and bob obtain a different index , although both use the same basis ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tab : encoding2 ] ) . when both use the same bases , it does not matter which set @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 bob chooses , since alice s basis",
    "is automatically included in his set and a key bit is obtained . taking this and the fact that",
    "alice and bob both choose the same bases with probability @xmath34 into account , we find that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the probability of alice and bob obtaining a key bit for each transmitted photon .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    the main difference between the qkd protocol which we discuss in this section and its original version is that using three bases gives alice and bob more flexibility . they can now choose their angles @xmath19 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 such that there are very strong correlations between the qber and the iter in case of intercept - resent eavesdropping .",
    "[ fig : evanopt_kmbvar ] illustrates the interplay between error rates and efficiencies for three different choices of the bases @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 . like fig .",
    "[ fig : evanopt_kmb09 ] before , this figure is the result of a numerical simulation which varies both angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 between @xmath5 and @xmath49 .",
    "the main difference between figs .",
    "[ fig : evanopt_kmb09 ] and [ fig : evanopt_kmbvar ] is that there is now a strong dependence of the iter on the qber .",
    "[ fig : evanopt_kmbvar](b ) and ( c ) even show a linear dependence .",
    "this means , in these two cases , intercept - resend eavesdropping has a distinct signature which makes it much harder for an eavesdropper to hide his presence .",
    "if the system errors of the transmission line do not have the same signature , he can not enter the scene unnoticed by simply replacing the transmission line between alice and bob with a less faulty one .",
    "in other words , eavesdropping errors can no longer be mimicked by system errors .",
    "this paper proposes a qkd protocol for which eavesdropping introduces not only one but two different types of errors into the key bit transmission with a distinct correlation between both of them .",
    "this is possible , since the protocol uses an encoding of information which is different from the encoding of information in bb84 @xcite . instead of each basis encoding a whole alphabet , all the states of the same basis",
    "encode the same letter . as a result",
    ", eavesdropping introduces quantum bit as well as index transmission errors .",
    "a quantum bit error occurs , when alice and bob both obtain different key bits .",
    "an index transmission error occurs when alice and bob use the same basis but their respective states nevertheless have different indices .",
    "intercept - resend eavesdropping results , in general , in a significant change of both the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) and the index transmission error rate ( iter ) .",
    "the main purpose of the proposed qkd protocol is to make it much harder for an eavesdropper to conceal his presence .",
    "the eavesdropper now not only has to minimise different types of errors .",
    "the above mentioned strong correlations between the iter and the qber introduce a distinct signature of eavesdropping .",
    "this signature allows alice and bob to detect the origin of their errors and to tolerate lower eavesdropping and higher system error rates without compromising their privacy .",
    "we no longer require that the error rates in case of eavesdropping unavoidably exceed the system error rate , since evan can no longer disguise his presence as system errors .",
    "as a result , alice and bob should be able to communicate securely over much longer distances .",
    "finally , let us remark that , for concrete practical implementations of the proposed qkd scheme , alice and bob should choose their bases @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 such that their system errors ( and not the eavesdropping errors ) have a distinct signature . changes of this signature can then herald evan s presence , independent of his eavesdropping strategy .",
    "evan only remains unnoticed , if the error rates and efficiencies which he introduces into the key bit transmission are the same as the ones caused by errors of the concrete experimental setup .",
    "finding an eavesdropping strategy which fulfils this condition is in general a very hard task for evan to complete .",
    "our analysis suggests that it might be impossible for evan to satisfy this condition .",
