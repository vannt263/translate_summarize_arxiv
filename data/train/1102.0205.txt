    "to understand the physical and chemical evolution of low - mass protostars , in particular the relative importance of radiative heating and shocks in their energy budget , spectrally resolved observations are required that can separate these components .",
    "the heterodyne instrument for the far - infrared ( hifi ) on _ herschel _ opens up the possibility to obtain high resolution data from high - frequency lines that are sensitive to gas temperatures up to several hundred kelvin .",
    "three well - known low - mass protostars ( iras  2a , 4a and 4b ) are studied as part of the _ water in star - forming regions with herschel _",

    "the @xmath2co  109 lines are dominated by broad ( fwhm 2530  km  s@xmath11 ) emission indicating a large - scale shock process ( @xmath121000  au ) .",
    "several co and @xmath3co line profiles also reveal a medium - broad component ( 510  km  s@xmath11 ) , seen prominently in h@xmath13o lines ( @xcite ) , indicative of small - scale shocks ( @xmath141000  au ) .",

    "three different models using the ` ratran ` radiative transfer code are applied to the optically thin c@xmath4o lines to quantify the co abundance .",
