    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) made of ultracold trapped bosonic atoms have become a vast ground to study interacting quantum systems @xcite .",
    "there has been a substantial theoretical interest in becs , and ample studies have been made to describe their static and dynamic properties using gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation governs a mean - field theory which assumes that all boson are described by a single time - dependent one - particle function throughout the evolution of the bec in time .",
    "it is generally accepted that gross - pitaevskii theory adequately describes the ground state and out - of - equilibrium dynamics of becs in the limit of an infinite number of particles and at constant interaction parameter ( i.e. , when the product of the number of particles times the scattering length is kept fixed ) . here ,",
    "mathematically rigorous results exist and show that , under certain conditions , the energy per particle and density per particle of the many - boson system coincide in this limit with the gross - piteavekii results and that the system is @xmath0 condensed @xcite .    whereas a condensate fraction of 100% implies that the number of depleted ( non - condensed ) particles divided by the total number of particles vanishes in the infinite - particle limit , the former is always non - zero in an interacting many - boson system .",
    "this observation has motivated us recently to look at properties of becs which depend on the number of depleted particles rather than the condensate fraction . in @xcite we showed , for the ground state as well as for an out - of - equilibrium bec , that even in the infinite - particle limit when the bec is 100% condensed , the variance of a many - particle operator and the uncertainty product of two such operators can differ from those predicted by the gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "the existence of many - body effects beyond those predicted by gross - pitaevskii theory stems from the necessity of performing the infinite - particle limit only after a many - particle quantum mechanical observable is evaluated and not prior to its evaluation . unlike the variance of operators of a single particle @xcite , the variance and uncertainty product of many - particle operators is more involved , also see @xcite in this context .",
    "it has furthermore been shown that the overlap of the exact and gross - pitaevskii wave - functions of a trapped bec in the limit of an infinite number of particles is always smaller than unity and may even become vanishingly small @xcite .    the purpose of the present work is to build on and go beyond @xcite in two directions , first , by studying the variance and uncertainty product of trapped bosons with a long - range inter - particle interaction and , second , when the system is no longer condensed .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "the density of the system is simply the diagonal of the reduced one - body density matrix , @xmath12 .",
    "we express in what follows quantities using the time - dependent natural orbitals @xmath10 .",
    "the diagonal part of the reduced two - body density matrix is given by [ 2rdm ] & = & d_3 ",
    "d_n ^(_1,_2, ",

    "we begin simply with the operator [ lin_term ] a = _ j=1^n a(_j ) of the many - particle system , where @xmath14 is a hermitian operator .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives the average per particle of @xmath15 in the state @xmath16 , [ average_a ] ( t)|a|(t)= d a ( ) , which is directly expressed in terms of the system s density per particle in case of a local operator in coordinate space @xmath17 . in the case of a local operator in momentum space @xmath18 we can write @xmath19 .    to proceed we also need the expectation value of the square of @xmath15 , [ sqr_term ] a^2 = _",

    "the first term , which is denoted by @xmath20 , describes the variance of @xmath14 resulting _ solely _ from the density per particle @xmath21 . the second term , which is denoted by @xmath22 , collects all other contributions to the many - particle variance and is identically zero within gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "@xmath22 is generally non - zero within a many - body theory .",
    "finally , taking two many - particle operators , a=_j=1^n a(_j ) , b=_j=1^n b(_j ) , and their respective time - dependent variances per particle , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , their uncertainty product satisfies the inequality [ uncertainty_t_1 ] _",

    "as mentioned above we would like to go beyond @xcite in the investigation of the variance and uncertainty product of trapped becs .",
    "to this end , we here study trapped bosons with a long - range interaction and when the system is no longer condensed .",
    "we treat structureless bosons with harmonic inter - particle interaction trapped in a single - well anharmonic potential .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation of the trapped bec has no analytical solution in the present study , see in this respect @xcite , nor even the variance and uncertainty product can be computed analytically , thus a numerical solution of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics is a must .",
    "this will lead to interesting results .",
    "we need a suitable and proved many - body tool to make the calculations .",
