    "the relation between the galaxy and dark matter distributions depends on the physics of galaxy formation , and it is expected that galaxies are , at least to some degree , biased tracers of the mass distribution .",
    "this expectation , which is supported by observational evidence that galaxy clustering varies with luminosity , morphology , and color ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) , complicates efforts to test cosmological models against observed galaxy clustering .",
    "however , the presence of bias also implies that galaxy clustering can be used to constrain the physics of galaxy formation , especially as independent observations define the background cosmology with increasing precision ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the 2df and sdss galaxy redshift surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which can measure the clustering of different galaxy types with unprecedented detail , are now bringing this goal within reach . achieving it",
    "requires a language for describing bias that is powerful enough to capture the information in these measurements and thereby connect observations of galaxy clustering to the physics of galaxy formation .    in this paper , we examine the influence of bias on galaxy clustering statistics , using the framework of the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) .",
    "this approach describes bias at the level of `` virialized '' dark matter halos , structures of typical overdensity @xmath4 , which are expected to be in approximate dynamical equilibrium .",
    "gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation can strongly influence the distribution of galaxies _ within _ such halos ( e.g. , the numbers , masses , and locations of galaxies ) , but the masses and spatial distribution of halos themselves should be determined mainly by gravitational dynamics of the dark matter . in the hod framework ,",
    "the bias of any particular class of galaxies is fully defined by the probability distribution @xmath0 that a halo of virial mass @xmath1 contains @xmath2 galaxies , along with the relations between the galaxy and dark matter spatial and velocity distributions within halos .",
    "while the history of the galaxy population is necessarily entwined with the background cosmology , the hod description suggests a useful conceptual division between the `` cosmological model '' and the `` theory of galaxy formation '' in predictions of galaxy clustering : the cosmological model determines the properties of the halo distribution , and the theory of galaxy formation specifies how those halos are populated with galaxies .",
    "the most important strength of the hod formulation of bias is its completeness . for a given cosmological model ,",
    "the hod tells us everything a theory of galaxy formation has to say about the statistics of galaxy clustering , in real space and redshift space , and on small , intermediate , and large scales .",
    "conversely , if we can determine the hod empirically , we will learn everything that observed galaxy clustering has to tell us about the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "moreover , the hod provides a physically informative basis for interpreting discrepancies between predicted and observed galaxy clustering , or between predictions of different galaxy formation theories themselves .",
    "it would be more illuminating to learn , for example , that a given theory predicts too many red galaxies in halos of mass @xmath5 than to learn that it predicts the wrong 3-point correlation function of such galaxies . finally ,",
    "since the hod describes bias at the level of systems near dynamical equilibrium , empirical determinations of the hod can take advantage of mass estimation methods that are inapplicable on large scales .",
    "for example , traditional virial methods and x - ray mass estimates of clusters can provide fairly direct constraints on @xmath0 at high @xmath1 ( see   5 ) .",
    "the halo occupation framework has a long history , initially in analytic models that described galaxy clustering as a superposition of randomly distributed clusters with specified profiles and a range of masses ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the explosion of recent activity in this field has been fueled partly by the recognition that a combination of this approach with recently developed tools for predicting the spatial clustering of halos @xcite provides a powerful formalism for analytic calculations of dark matter clustering , which can be naturally extended to biased galaxy populations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and numerous other papers referred to in subsequent sections ) .",
    "our own interest was sparked largely by the paper of @xcite ( @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for similar analyses ) , who demonstrated that they could reproduce the clustering of galaxies in their semi - analytic models by populating n - body halos according to a predicted @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the predicted clustering depends not only on the complex mass dependence of the mean occupation , but also on finer details of sub - poisson fluctuations about the mean .",
    "this result illustrates the power of the hod to test detailed predictions of galaxy formation theories .",
    "models of @xmath0 based on semi - analytic calculations of @xcite and @xcite have been incorporated into several of the papers cited above , and some recent papers have presented predictions of hydrodynamic simulations for @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will compare predictions of @xmath0 from hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic calculations in a future study ( berlind et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the hod description can be contrasted with another widely used approach that characterizes bias in terms of the correlation between galaxy density and properties of the large - scale environment , such as mass density , temperature , and geometry .",
    "this `` environmental bias '' approach has been used to study the effects of generic biasing models on galaxy clustering statistics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; narayanan , berlind , & weinberg 2000 ; berlind , narayanan , & weinberg 2001 ) and to encapsulate predictions of hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has also led to valuable analytic results concerning the shape of the galaxy power spectrum and the influence of bias on higher - order clustering on large scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however",
    ", this formulation can not effectively describe bias on scales smaller than the smoothing length used to define the environment , and the choice of smoothing scale is , itself , rather arbitrary . in the hod framework , there is some range of reasonable methods for defining halos , but the choice of @xmath4 for a typical halo boundary is well motivated by the division between the infall and dynamical equilibrium regimes .",
    "also , as already noted , this choice allows use of virial mass estimates to constrain @xmath0 empirically , while the large - scale matter density , which plays a fundamental role in environmental formulations of bias , is generally unobservable .",
    "our methodology in this paper is to define generic models of the hod , apply them to an n - body simulation of the inflationary cold dark matter scenario ( see   2 ) , and investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering statistics on the hod parameters .",
    "this numerical approach complements earlier analytic work on halo bias by considering a wider range of clustering statistics and hod models , some of them not readily amenable to analytic calculations .",
    "we will interpret our results in light of the analytic formalism developed in other papers and in terms of some heuristic analytic models presented here as a guide for understanding .",
    "the next section defines our hod prescriptions more formally .",
    "we then devote considerable attention , in   3 , to the two - point correlation function @xmath6 , because of its intrinsic importance and in order to illustrate some general features of the way the hod influences galaxy clustering .",
    "we consider other clustering statistics in   4 , and properties of galaxy groups in   5 .",
    "a general theme emerging from these results is that different statistics respond to different features of the hod , implying that precise measurements of galaxy clustering can in principle yield an empirical determination of the hod .",
    "achieving this goal in practice requires a scheme for getting a good first guess at the hod that will reproduce the observed galaxy clustering .",
    "we outline such a scheme and present an illustrative test in   6 . in its present form",
    ", this scheme assumes that the underlying cosmology is known , but we speculate on prospects for breaking the degeneracy between bias and cosmology .",
    "we summarize our results in   7 .",
    "in the hod framework , the relation between the galaxy and matter distributions is fully defined by ( 1 ) the probability distribution @xmath0 that a halo of virial mass @xmath1 contains @xmath2 galaxies , ( 2 ) the relation between the galaxy and dark matter spatial distributions within halos , and ( 3 ) the relation between the galaxy and dark matter velocity distributions within halos .",
    "we use the term `` halo occupation distribution '' ( or hod ) to refer to all three of these aspects .",
    "each individual class of galaxies ( defined , for example , by luminosity and color ranges or by morphological type ) has its own hod .    for this study",
    "we have used the high resolution gif n - body simulations carried out by the virgo consortium @xcite .",
    "the particular model we have focused on is the flat @xmath7cdm model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and a spectral shape parameter @xmath11 ( in the parameterization of @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation follows the evolution of @xmath12 particles , each of mass @xmath13 , in a comoving box of size @xmath14 .",
    "the rms mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath15 are @xmath16 , in agreement with the observed abundance of clusters @xcite .",
    "gravitational forces are significantly softer than @xmath17 on scales @xmath18 .",
    "we identify halos in the dark matter distribution using a `` friends - of - friends '' ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath19 times the mean inter - particle separation , and we only consider halos consisting of 10 or more particles .",
    "this means that the smallest halos we can resolve have a mass of @xmath20 .    for our present purposes ,",
    "an hod prescription amounts to a recipe for selecting a subset of the dark matter particles in these halos to represent the galaxy population of the simulation .",
    "most of the models we show in this paper are tuned to produce a galaxy population with a space density of @xmath21 .",
    "this space density corresponds to galaxies of luminosity @xmath22 , assuming no further cuts in color or morphology .",
    "our hod prescriptions consist of the following features :    \\1 .",
    "_ @xmath23 _  we consider two types of models for this relation , power laws and broken power laws . in the power - law models ,",
    "the mean number of galaxies that populate dark matter halos of mass @xmath1 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the power - law index , @xmath26 is the cutoff halo mass below which halos can not contain galaxies , and @xmath27 sets the amplitude of the relation and corresponds to the mass of halos that contain , on average , one galaxy . in the broken power - law models , @xmath28 where @xmath25 and @xmath29 are the low and high mass power - law indices , @xmath30 is the halo mass at which the power - law slope breaks , and @xmath31 is required by continuity to be @xmath32 . for a given hod model , the value of @xmath27 is chosen to produce a galaxy population of the desired space density .    the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are directly related to the efficiency of galaxy formation as a function of halo mass .",
    "for example , bright galaxies can not form in halos below a certain mass because these halos do not contain enough cold gas , hence the need for @xmath26 .",
    "the simplest form of @xmath23 would have @xmath2 proportional to @xmath1 ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath34 .",
    "however , many physical mechanisms can alter the efficiency of galaxy formation as a function of halo mass .",
    "for example , the typical cooling time for gas increases with halo mass , and this suggests that @xmath35 . this effect could be counteracted by an earlier average formation time of galaxies that end up in high mass halos .",
    "galaxy mergers may alter galaxy numbers preferentially in intermediate mass halos , where mergers are most frequent .",
    "any given physical process can affect @xmath23 differently for different galaxy classes .",
    "for example , mergers decrease the number of low luminosity galaxies but increase the number of high luminosity galaxies .",
    "morphological transformations , likewise , increase the numbers of one galaxy type while decreasing those of another",
    ". we will , therefore , be able to learn much about the processes that determine galaxy properties by comparing the hod for different galaxy classes .",
    "_ @xmath36 _  once @xmath37 is determined , the actual number of galaxies that occupies any given halo is drawn from a probability distribution @xmath36 .",
    "we consider three such probability distributions : ( a ) a poisson distribution ; ( b ) a very narrow distribution , which we call `` average '' , where the actual number of galaxies is the integer either above or below @xmath37 , with relative frequencies needed to give the required mean ( this is identical to the `` average '' distribution used by @xcite ) ; ( c ) a negative binomial distribution , which is substantially wider than poisson .",
    "although it is possible for the form of @xmath36 to vary with @xmath1 , we do not consider such models in this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows @xmath0 for a particular hod prescription ( power - law @xmath23 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "each point represents the number of galaxies chosen to occupy a particular halo in the dark matter distribution .",
    "the two panels show the difference between assuming an average and a poisson @xmath36 .",
    "= 5.0truein    in the high halo mass regime , @xmath36 should depend on the statistics of halo merger histories @xcite . the distribution of merger histories for halos of a given mass will produce a resulting distribution of galaxy numbers for those halos . in the low mass regime , each halo is expected to contain only one galaxy , but whether that galaxy would pass a given luminosity threshold depends on the gas cooling and star formation history of that halo .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 depends on the regularity of galaxy formation in halos of a given final mass .",
    "_ central galaxy _ ",
    "once the actual number of galaxies @xmath2 that occupy each halo is determined , we must specify how these galaxies are distributed within halos .",
    "the first step in this process is to specify whether or not there must be a galaxy at the center of each halo for which @xmath40 .",
    "we investigate both these cases .",
    "if we force a galaxy to sit at the halo center , we place it at the halo center of mass and assign it the mean halo velocity .",
    "_ galaxy concentration _",
    " we allow for the possibility that galaxies are more or less spatially concentrated than the dark matter within halos .",
    "we implement such models by selecting `` galaxy '' particles with probability @xmath41 , so that , on average , @xmath42 this prescription imposes a difference @xmath43 in the logarithmic slopes of galaxy and dark matter profiles without imposing any specific form or symmetry on the galaxy distribution in the halos ; the galaxy distribution will inherit the geometry of the dark matter",
    ". a non - zero @xmath43 can be applied together with the central galaxy prescription or on its own .",
    ". _ velocity bias _  finally , we allow for the possibility of velocity bias within halos .",
    "the mean velocity of galaxies in a halo should not differ from that of the dark matter , since both components are responding to the same large - scale gravitational field .",
    "however , the galaxies in a halo might have a higher or lower velocity dispersion than the dark matter particles at the same locations .",
    "we define a velocity bias factor @xmath44 through the relation @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the velocities of the galaxies and the dark matter particles that they are assigned to and @xmath48 is the mean center - of - mass halo velocity . for example , if @xmath49 all the galaxies within a halo have the mean halo velocity , while if @xmath50 galaxy velocities trace the dark matter velocities .",
    "our central galaxy and galaxy concentration prescriptions impose some degree of velocity bias even if @xmath50 , the first because the central galaxy is assumed to move at @xmath48 , and the second because the typical dark matter velocities depend on radius if the halo is not isothermal .",
    "prescriptions  3 , 4 , and 5 allow us to represent a number of physical processes that could affect the galaxy distribution in important ways .",
    "for example , dynamical friction could cause galaxies to sink to the center of a halo and end up with a spatial distribution that is more centrally concentrated and a velocity distribution that is colder than that of dark matter .",
    "in addition , if galaxies form near the centers of their original parent halos , they can inherit spatial and velocity bias as a result of incomplete relaxation during the merging of these halos into a larger common halo @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxy mergers happening at the centers of massive halos could reduce galaxy numbers in those regions , thus causing galaxies to be less centrally concentrated than dark matter ( @xmath51 ) . also , an @xmath52 velocity bias could arise as a result of preferential destruction or merging of galaxies that have a low velocity .    following the above steps , we have created a large number of galaxy distributions spanning a wide space of hod parameters .",
    "all of these galaxy distributions come from the same dark halo population and differ only in the hod .",
    "we have calculated a variety of clustering statistics for each of these galaxy distributions in order to test the sensitivity of each statistic to features of the hod .",
    "it would be impractical to show all statistics for all of our hod models , so in each of the following sections we focus on a subset of models that illustrate the sensitivity of the statistic under examination .",
    "our approach of populating n - body simulations according to an hod with power - law @xmath23 is similar to that used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in their modeling of measurements from the lcrs and pscz redshift surveys .",
    "however , the implementations are different , and our hod model is substantially more general : we allow variations of @xmath26 and the form of @xmath36 in addition to variations in @xmath25 , and we allow the possibility of spatial and velocity biases within halos",
    ".    we asserted in   1 that the hod formulation can provide a complete statistical description of the bias between galaxies and mass .",
    "underlying this assertion is an implicit assumption that the galaxy content of a halo of virial mass @xmath1 is statistically independent of that halo s larger scale environment .",
    "this assumption is supported by the n - body simulation results of @xcite , who find , in agreement with predictions of the excursion set model @xcite , that halos of fixed mass in different environments have similar properties and formation histories , although the halo mass function is itself systematically shifted towards higher mass halos in high density regions . however , the alleged independence of halo histories and large scale environment merits more detailed theoretical investigation .",
    "the hypothesis that the hod formulation is complete will ultimately be tested empirically , by seeing whether an hod model can reproduce all facets of observed galaxy clustering when applied to a cosmological model consistent with other observational data .",
    "additional implicit assumptions , that all galaxies reside in virialized dark matter halos and that the halo population itself is minimally affected by baryonic physics , seem well justified , though the latter deserves more thorough testing with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "halos , so they are described statistically by the hod itself . ]",
    "the specific parameterizations adopted here may not capture all of the important features of the true hod , though they are flexible enough to produce a wide range of results and can easily be generalized to include , e.g. , mass dependence of @xmath36 or @xmath43 .",
    "we begin our analysis with the two - point correlation function @xmath53 , which plays a fundamental role in understanding galaxy clustering because it has been thoroughly studied as a function of galaxy type , color , and luminosity ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and numerous references therein ) and because its observed form is remarkably simple . for typical optically selected samples , @xmath53 is a power - law @xmath54 for separations @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "more luminous galaxies have a larger @xmath58 and similar @xmath59 , while redder or early - type galaxies have a larger @xmath59 and a higher clustering amplitude on small scales .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations show that cdm models do not predict a power - law matter correlation function ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and analytic theory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) implies that the linear theory power spectrum would have to contain a specially tuned feature in order to yield a power - law @xmath6 on non - linear scales .",
    "if the primordial power spectrum is a smooth function , as expected on theoretical grounds , it appears that scale - dependent bias must transform the curved matter correlation function into a power - law galaxy correlation function .",
    "remarkably , galaxy distributions predicted by hydrodynamic simulations , by `` sub - halo '' analyses of high resolution n - body simulations , and by semi - analytic models applied to n - body halos all yield power - law galaxy correlation functions , at least for some reasonable choices of cosmology and galaxy definition parameters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the context of hod bias",
    ", we would like to know whether a power - law @xmath53 follows from some simple and generic property of the hod , such as a particular galaxy profile in high multiplicity halos , or whether it demands finely tuned parameter choices .",
    "we also want to know more generally how the amplitude and shape of @xmath53 depend on parameters of the hod .",
    "recent papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) present a fairly complete analytic theory of the galaxy correlation function in the halo bias model .",
    "the basic idea is to add the `` 1-halo '' term representing galaxy pairs within a single halo to the `` 2-halo '' term representing pairs in separate , spatially correlated halos ( as done in a different context by @xcite ) .",
    "the full analytic theory becomes simple in the fourier domain , where convolutions of the halo profile transform into multiplications . as a guide to interpreting our numerical results",
    ", we begin with a complementary , more approximate discussion of correlations in real space .    for separations larger than the virial diameter of the largest halos , all pairs must come from galaxies in separate halos .",
    "@xcite derived an analytic approximation for the bias factor of halos @xmath60 as a function of halo mass @xmath1 using the @xcite formalism . above the characteristic mass @xmath61 in the press - schechter mass function ,",
    "halo formation is enhanced in regions of high background density ( and suppressed in underdense regions ) , so @xmath60 exceeds unity and increases rapidly with increasing mass .",
    "halos with @xmath62 are weakly anti - biased because they merge into more massive systems in overdense regions .",
    "@xcite numerical results yield @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that the cross - correlation between halos of mass @xmath27 and @xmath65 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mass correlation function .",
    "consider a halo of mass @xmath27 .",
    "the mean number of excess galaxies in a volume @xmath68 at distance @xmath69 from the halo is obtained by integrating over the differential halo mass function @xmath70 ( which has units of number density per unit mass ) , weighting each halo by the mean number of galaxies @xmath23 and by the biased correlation factor : @xmath71 if the number density of galaxies is @xmath72 , then the number density of correlated galaxy pairs is @xmath73 where the factor of @xmath74 corrects for double counting of each pair .",
    "thus , at large separations we expect @xmath75 and the galaxy bias is just the weighted value of the halo bias .    on small scales , the correlation function is dominated by the 1-halo term representing galaxy pairs that reside in the same halo .",

    "more generally , we can write @xmath79 where @xmath80 refers specifically to the correlation function associated with galaxy pairs in the same halo and the function @xmath81 represents the average fraction of galaxy pairs in halos of mass @xmath1 that have separation less than @xmath69 ( a fraction @xmath82 of the virial diameter ) . since the only @xmath69 dependence on the r.h.s",

    "such comparisons become harder for low multiplicity groups , though it may soon be possible to test for any overall bias by comparing mean dynamical masses to the group - mass correlation function derived from weak lensing .",

    "the encouraging implication is that combinations of clustering measurements can pin down the properties of the hod , hemming it in with complementary constraints .",

    "the sdss also provides detailed photometric information for all galaxies in the redshift survey , allowing studies of the hod for a multitude of galaxy classes , and weak lensing measurements from the sdss images can determine the galaxy - mass correlation function for each of these classes .    in this section ,",
    "we outline a strategy for determining the hod from observations , and although this outline is far from complete , we believe that it offers a promising route forward . since the possible parameter space of hod models is extremely broad , a practical strategy requires some procedure for getting a good first guess at @xmath0 , which can then be refined and tested using a battery of clustering measures .",
    "our procedure assumes that the underlying cosmological model is known in advance based on independent observations , though the model can be further tested by seeing whether it reproduces all aspects of observed galaxy clustering for some hod .",

    "successful application of this procedure to surveys like the 2dfgrs and sdss would tell us essentially everything that local ( @xmath324 ) galaxy clustering has to say about galaxy formation , assuming that the adopted cosmological model is correct .",
    "determinations of the hod for different galaxy classes would provide detailed targets for analytic or numerical models of galaxy formation and insight into the physics that controls galaxy luminosities , colors , and morphologies .    if , as we have speculated , the effects of cosmology and bias are not degenerate , then the hod determination procedure becomes something still more powerful : a systematic way of testing cosmological models against galaxy clustering data given only some very general assumptions about galaxy formation ( basically the validity of the hod framework itself ) .",
    "incorrect cosmological models would fail to reproduce the observations for any choice of hod .",
    "of course , galaxy clustering provides a testing ground for cosmology even with less detailed assumptions about galaxy formation , since the effects of `` local '' bias on the power spectrum , higher order moments , redshift - space distortions , and galaxy density and velocity fields become relatively simple on sufficiently large scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) , which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability @xmath0 that a dark matter halo of virial mass @xmath1 contains @xmath2 galaxies , together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos . by populating the halos of a cosmological n - body simulation using a variety of hod models , we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the hod . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of @xmath0 on different scales . </S>",
    "<S> obtaining the observed power - law form of @xmath3 requires rather specific combinations of hod parameters , implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation ; the success of numerical and semi - analytic models in reproducing this form is entirely non - trivial . </S>",
    "<S> other clustering statistics such as the galaxy - mass correlation function , the bispectrum , the void probability function , the pairwise velocity dispersion , and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of hod parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a strategy for determining the hod empirically from redshift survey data . </S>",
    "<S> this method starts from an assumed cosmological model , but we argue that cosmological and hod parameters will have non - degenerate effects on galaxy clustering , so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of hod . </S>",
    "<S> empirical determinations of the hod as a function of galaxy type from the 2df and sdss redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation , insight into the origin of galaxy properties , and sharper tests of cosmological models . </S>"
