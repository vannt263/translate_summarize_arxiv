    "the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) contains gas over a wide range of densities , temperatures and ionization states",
    ". these can be broadly sub - divided into the molecular phase ( e.g. @xcite ) , the neutral atomic phase ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the warm and hot ionized phases ( e.g. @xcite ) . the neutral atomic medium ( mostly neutral hydrogen , hi ) is further usually sub - divided into `` cold '' and `` warm '' phases ( the `` cnm '' and `` wnm '' , respectively ) .",
    "typical cnm temperatures and densities are @xmath6  k and @xmath7  @xmath8 , respectively , with corresponding wnm values of @xmath9  k and @xmath10  @xmath8 .",
    "this was originally an observational definition , to distinguish between phases producing strong narrow absorption lines towards background radio - loud quasars and smooth broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "later , this separation into cold and warm phases was found to arise naturally in the context of models in which the atomic and ionized phases are in pressure equilibrium .",
    "atomic gas at intermediate temperatures was found to be unstable to perturbations , and to migrate to either the cold or warm stable phases , given sufficient time to attain pressure equilibrium @xcite .",
    "radio studies of the hi-21 cm transition have played a vital role in understanding physical conditions in the neutral ism .",
    "the hi-21 cm excitation temperature of a gas cloud ( the `` spin temperature '' , @xmath11 ) can be shown to depend on the local kinetic temperature ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) , with @xmath13 in the cnm and @xmath14 in the wnm @xcite .",
    "since the hi-21 cm absorption opacity for a fixed hi  column density varies inversely with @xmath11 , while the emissivity is independent of @xmath11 ( in the low opacity limit ) , hi-21 cm absorption studies against background radio sources are primarily sensitive to the presence of cnm along the sightline , while hi-21 cm emission studies are sensitive to both warm and cold hi .",
    "indeed , the original evidence for two temperature phases in the neutral gas stemmed from a comparison between hi-21 cm absorption and emission spectra @xcite .",
    "physical conditions in the neutral gas are also known to depend on the gas column density . at the low hi  column densities of the inter - galactic medium , @xmath15  @xmath16 ,",
    "the gas is optically thin to ionizing ultraviolet ( uv ) photons and is hence mostly ionized , giving rise to the so - called lyman-@xmath5 forest @xcite . at higher hi  column densities , @xmath17  @xmath16 ,",
    "the hi  is optically - thick to ionizing photons at the lyman - limit , and the core of the lyman-@xmath5 absorption line is saturated .",
    "such `` lyman - limit systems '' are partially ionized and typically arise for sightlines through the outskirts of galaxies @xcite . at still higher hi  column densities , @xmath18  @xmath16 ,",
    "the lyman-@xmath5 line becomes optically - thick in its naturally - broadened wings and acquires a lorentzian shape ; such systems are called damped lyman-@xmath5 absorbers ( dlas ; @xcite ) .",
    "damped absorption is ubiquitous on sightlines through galaxy disks and , at high redshifts , has long been used as the signature of the presence of an intervening galaxy along a quasar sightline @xcite .",
    "finally , the molecular hydrogen fraction shows a steep transition from very low values to greater than 5% at @xmath19  @xmath16  in the galaxy @xcite ) .",
    "neutral gas is likely to become predominantly molecular at higher hi   column densities , @xmath20  @xmath16  @xcite .    while it is well known that a threshold column density ( @xmath19  @xmath16 ) is required to form the molecular phase , for self - shielding against uv photons in the @xmath21 lyman band @xcite , the conditions for cnm formation are less clear . in this _ letter _ , we report results from hi-21 cm absorption studies of a large sample of compact radio sources that indicate the presence of a similar , albeit lower , hi  column density threshold for cnm formation in the milky way .",
    "we have used the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt , 23 sources ) , the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , 10 sources ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca , 2 sources ) to carry out sensitive , high spectral resolution ( @xmath22  km / s ) hi-21 cm absorption spectroscopy towards 35  compact radio - loud quasars .",
    "most of the target sources were selected to be b - array calibrators for the very large array , and have angular sizes @xmath23 .",
    "details of the sample selection , observations and data analysis are given in @xcite , @xcite , roy et al .",
    "( 2011 , in prep . ) and kanekar & braun ( 2011 , in prep . ) .",
    "the final optical - depth spectra have root - mean - square ( rms ) noise values of @xmath24 per 1  km / s channel , with a median rms noise of @xmath25 per 1  km / s channel .",
    "these rms noise values are at off - line channels , away from hi-21 cm emission that increases the system temperature , and hence , the rms noise . a careful bandpass calibration procedure was used to ensure a high spectral dynamic range and excellent sensitivity to wide absorption [ see @xcite and @xcite for details ] .",
    "these are among the deepest hi-21 cm absorption spectra ever obtained ( e.g. @xcite ) and constitute by far the largest sample of absorption spectra of this sensitivity .",
    "the use of interferometry also implies that the spectra are not contaminated by hi-21 cm emission within the beam , unlike the case with single - dish absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "galactic hi-21 cm absorption was detected against every source but one , b0438 - 436 .",
    "we used the leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) survey @xcite to estimate the `` apparent '' hi  column density ( uncorrected for self - absorption , i.e. @xmath26  @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath27 is the brightness temperature ) at a location adjacent to each target .",
    "the observational results are summarized in table  [ tab : summary ] , whose columns contain ( 1 )  the quasar name , ( 2 )  its galactic latitude , ( 3 )  the hi  column density ( uncorrected for self - absorption ) , in units of @xmath28  @xmath16 , from the lab survey , ( 4 )  the integrated hi-21 cm optical depth @xmath29 , in km / s , and ( 5 )  the harmonic - mean spin temperature @xmath11 in k , estimated assuming the low optical depth limit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "finally , for the one source with undetected hi-21 cm absorption ( b0438 - 436 ) , we quote a @xmath31 upper limit on the integrated hi-21 cm optical depth , assuming a gaussian line profile with a full width at half maximum of 20  km / s , and the corresponding @xmath31 lower limit on the spin temperature .",

    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the integrated hi-21 cm optical depth plotted against hi  column density , on a logarithmic scale .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the integrated hi-21 cm optical depth has a rough power - law dependence on @xmath34 for @xmath18  @xmath16 .",
    "however , there is a steep decline in @xmath35 for hi  column densities lower than this value .",
    "these properties were noted previously by @xcite for individual spectral features ( see their figs .",
    "36 ) rather than the line - of - sight integral .",
    "a similar pattern is visible in the right panel of the figure , which plots the spin temperature @xmath11 against @xmath34 .",
    "24 out of 25 sightlines with @xmath36  @xmath16  show @xmath37  k , while all ten sightlines with @xmath38  @xmath16  have @xmath39  k. the median spin temperature for sightlines with @xmath18  @xmath16  is @xmath40  k , while that for sightlines with @xmath41  k is @xmath42  k. thus , there appears to be a physical difference between sightlines with hi  columns lower and higher than the column density @xmath43  @xmath16 .",
    "note that the use of apparent @xmath34 only affects high - opacity sightlines , and has no significant effect on our results .",
    "we used a number of non - parametric two - sample tests ( e.g. the gehan test , the peto - prentice test , the logrank test , etc ) , generalized for censored data , to determine whether the spin temperatures of sightlines with @xmath44 and @xmath45 are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "all tests used the asurv rev .",
    "1.2 package @xcite which implements the methods of @xcite .",
    "the use of multiple tests guards against any biases within a given test , resulting from the relatively small sample size ( 10 systems with @xmath45 ) and the presence of censored values @xcite .",
    "errors on individual measurements were handled through a monte - carlo approach , using the measured values of @xmath11 and @xmath34 ( and the associated errors ) for each sightline to generate @xmath46 sets of 35 pairs of @xmath11 and @xmath34 values .",
    "the statistical significance of each result ( quoted below ) is the average of values obtained in these @xmath46 trials for each test .",
    "the tests found clear evidence , with statistical significance between @xmath47 and @xmath48 that the spin temperatures for sightlines with @xmath44 and @xmath45 are drawn from different parent populations .",
    "following @xcite , our final result is based on the peto - prentice test , as this has been found to give the best results for very different sample sizes @xcite .",
    "the two @xmath11 sub - samples ( with `` low '' and `` high '' @xmath34 ) are then found to be drawn from different parent distributions at @xmath49 significance ; the probability of this arising by chance is @xmath50 .",
    "it thus appears that sightlines with @xmath51  @xmath16   have systematically higher spin temperatures than sightlines with @xmath52 .",
    "the spin temperature measured here is the column - density - weighted harmonic mean of the spin temperatures of different `` phases '' along the line of sight ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a sightline with @xmath34 equally divided between cnm and wnm , with @xmath53  k and @xmath54  k respectively , would yield an average @xmath55  k , while one with 90% of gas with @xmath56  k and 10% with @xmath53  k would yield an average @xmath57  k. in other words , a high @xmath11 indicates the presence of a smaller fraction of the cold phase of hi .",
    "thus , the fact that average spin temperatures are significantly higher on sightlines with low hi  column densities , @xmath38  @xmath16 , indicates that such low-@xmath34 sightlines contain low cnm fractions , far smaller than those on sightlines with @xmath18  @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] that the integrated hi-21 cm optical depth drops sharply at @xmath58 , due to the decline in the cnm fraction at low hi  column densities .",
    "this can be accounted for by a simple physical model in which a minimum `` shielding '' hi  column density of wnm is needed for the formation of the cold phase in an hi  cloud .",
    "assuming that the hi-21 cm optical depth in the wnm is negligible compared to that in the cnm , the equation of radiative transfer for a `` sandwich '' geometry can be written as @xmath59 where the explicit velocity dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 has been omitted for clarity and the integrated hi  emission profile becomes , @xmath62 or , @xmath63 for a measured `` apparent '' column density , @xmath64 ( assuming negligible self - opacity ) , a threshold column density ( where @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 , a saturation column density ( where @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 and an effective opacity , @xmath69 . the effective opacity is related to the measured integrated opacity by the effective linewidth , @xmath70 , as @xmath71 .    the upper and lower dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] show the above expression for ( @xmath72  @xmath16 , @xmath73  @xmath16 , @xmath74  km / s ) and ( @xmath75  @xmath16 , @xmath76  @xmath16 , @xmath77  km / s ) , respectively . note that the effective linewidth only shifts the curves up and down in the figure .",
    "the fact that none of the data points of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] lie to the left of the upper curve indicates that a minimum _ shielding _ hi  column of @xmath78 \\sim 5 \\times 10^{19}$ ]  @xmath16   is needed for the formation of the cold neutral medium . note that , in the above `` sandwich '' geometry , a total wnm column density of @xmath79  @xmath16  is needed before any cnm can be formed",
    "most theoretical models of the diffuse interstellar medium treat it as a multi - phase medium , consisting of neutral and ionized phases in pressure equilibrium ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the mckee - ostriker model , physical conditions in the ism are regulated by supernova explosions , whose blast waves sweep up gas in the ism into shells , leaving large cavities full of hot ionized gas @xcite .",
    "cold atomic gas is then formed by the rapid cooling of the swept - up and shocked gas .",
    "soft x - rays from neighbouring hot ionized gas and stellar uv photons penetrate into the cnm and heat and partially ionize it , producing envelopes of warm neutral and warm ionized gas ( wim ) .",
    "thus , a typical ism `` cloud '' [ see fig .  1 of @xcite ] is expected to form at the edges of supernova remnants and super - bubbles containing the hot ionized medium ( him ) .",
    "such a cloud consists of a cnm core surrounded by a wnm envelope and a further wim shell , all of which are in pressure equilibrium .",
    "the cnm core is almost entirely neutral , the wnm and wim are partially ionized , and the him is almost entirely ionized @xcite .",
    "a threshold hi  column density for cnm formation in an ism cloud arises quite naturally due to the need for self - shielding against ionizing ultraviolet ( and soft x - ray ) photons ( see also @xcite ) . at low hi  columns",
    ", uv photons can penetrate all the way into a cloud core and heat ( and partly ionize ) the hi . only clouds",
    "that self - shield against the penetration of these high - energy photons can retain a stable cnm core .",
    "self - shielding against uv photons is significant once the optical depth at the lyman limit crosses unity , i.e. for @xmath80  @xmath16 , and becomes more and more efficient with increasing hi  column density .",
    "our results indicate that self - shielding only becomes entirely efficient at excluding uv photons from the interior of hi  clouds at a _ total _ hi  column density of @xmath81  @xmath16 . below this threshold ,",
    "sufficient uv photons penetrate into the cloud interior to hinder the survival of the cold phase .",
    "the simple `` sandwich '' model overlaid on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] suggests that a shielding column of @xmath82  @xmath16   _ on each exposed surface of a cloud _ is sufficient to exclude uv photons , with the rest of the hi  then free to cool to lower temperatures .",
    "it is also possible that sightlines with low @xmath34 are sampling gas at higher distances from the galactic plane , with lower metallicity and pressure .",
    "two - phase models that incorporate detailed balancing of heating and cooling rates obtain lower cnm fractions at lower pressures and metallicities @xcite .",
    "observationally , @xcite have found evidence for an anti - correlation between spin temperature and metallicity in high-@xmath83 dlas , with low - metallicity dlas having higher spin temperatures , probably because the paucity of metals yields fewer cooling routes @xcite . if low-@xmath34 sightlines contain `` clouds '' with systematically lower metallicities ( and/or pressures )",
    ", these could have lower cooling rates and hence , lower cnm fractions .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have estimates of either pressure or metallicity along our sightlines and hence can not test this possibility .",
    "we note that all sightlines with high spin temperatures are at intermediate or high galactic latitudes , @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) , suggesting larger distances from the plane .",
    "conversely , the figure also shows that low spin temperatures ( @xmath85  k ) are obtained even for sightlines at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "measurements of the metallicity and pressure along the low-@xmath34 sightlines , through uv spectroscopy , would be of much interest .",
    "there have been earlier suggestions , based on semi - analytical or numerical treatments of self - shielding , that hi  clouds are predominantly neutral for @xmath87  @xmath16  ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , this is the first direct evidence for a change in physical conditions in hi  clouds at this column density .",
    "note that this is a factor of several lower than the known threshold of @xmath19  @xmath16  for the formation of molecular hydrogen in galactic clouds , set by the requirement of self - shielding against uv photons at wavelengths in the h@xmath88 lyman band @xcite .",
    "thus , there appear to be three column densities at which phase transitions occur in ism clouds , at @xmath81  @xmath16  resulting in the formation of cold hi , at @xmath89  @xmath16  resulting in the formation of molecular hydrogen , and finally , at @xmath90  @xmath16 , when most of the atomic gas is converted into the molecular phase .    in this context , it is vital to appreciate that the abscissa of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] refers to _ apparent  _ hi  column density under the assumption of negligible self - opacity of the hi  profile .",
    "the saturation column density , n@xmath91 , is an _",
    "observational _ upper limit to @xmath92 and does not represent a physical limit on @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , the widespread occurrence of the hi  self - absorption phenomenon within the galaxy @xcite and the detailed modeling of high resolution extragalactic hi  spectra suggests that self - opacity is a common occurrence @xcite which can disguise neutral column densities that reach @xmath93  @xmath16 .",
    "the original definition of a dla as an absorber with @xmath94  @xmath16  was an observational one , based on the requirement that the damping wings of the lyman-@xmath5 line be detectable in low - resolution optical spectra of moderate sensitivity @xcite . with today",
    "s 10-m class optical telescopes , it is easy to detect the damping wings at significantly lower hi  column densities , @xmath95  @xmath16(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) ; such systems are referred to as `` sub - dlas '' .",
    "there has been much debate in the literature on whether or not dlas and sub - dlas should be treated as a single class of absorber and on their relative importance in contributing to the cosmic budget of neutral hydrogen and metals ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argue that dlas and sub - dlas are physically different , claiming that most of the hi  in sub - dlas is ionized and at high temperature , while that in dlas is mostly neutral ; this is based on numerical estimates of self - shielding in dlas and sub - dlas against the high-@xmath83 uv background @xcite .",
    "our detection of an hi  column density threshold for cnm formation that matches the defining dla column density indicates that dlas and sub - dlas are indeed physically different types of absorbers , with sub - dlas likely to have significantly lower cnm fractions than dlas , at a given metallicity .    in summary ,",
    "we report the discovery of a threshold hi  column density , @xmath96  @xmath16 , for cold gas formation in hi   clouds in the interstellar medium . above this threshold ,",
    "the majority of galactic sightlines have low spin temperatures , @xmath97  k , with a median value of @xmath40  k. below this threshold , typical sightlines have far higher spin temperatures , @xmath98  k , with a median value of @xmath42  k. the threshold for cnm formation appears to arise naturally due to the need for self - shielding against ultraviolet photons , which penetrate into the cloud at lower hi  columns and heat and ionize the hi , inhibiting the formation of the cold neutral medium .",
