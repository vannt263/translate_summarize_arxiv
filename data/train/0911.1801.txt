    "in a @xmath2 cold dark matter universe ( @xmath2cdm ) , the formation of structures generally involves the merging of smaller structures .",
    "mass is built up predominantly by the merger of objects of masses between @xmath3 of the galaxy s total mass at redshift @xmath4 @xcite . since @xmath5 ,",
    "approximately 60% of galaxies have experienced a major merger , which we will take in this paper as those involving a ratio of masses 3:1 or higher . also , an important fraction of the baryonic mass ( 30 - 50% ) of @xmath4 galaxies is provided by major mergers @xcite .",
    "recent observations show that nearly 20% of the massive disc galaxies have undergone a major merger since @xmath6 @xcite this process is virtually scale - free , meaning that low - mass dark matter halos , in which disc galaxies presumably reside , have undergone similar merging histories to high - mass dark matter halos in which , predominantly , ellipticals reside .",
    "this at first is puzzling , as mergers have long been associated with forming spheroidal structures , i.e. early - type galaxies @xcite . following this line of reasoning",
    ", every galaxy in the nearby universe should be an elliptical or an irregular , which is clearly not the case .",
    "furthermore , observed elliptical galaxies can be described by simple relations relating colors , luminosities , masses , etc .",
    "these simple relations are difficult to reproduce with a scenario involving collisions @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this , of course , lies with the baryonic physics .",
    "studies using two stable discs as initial conditions ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b07 ) ; @xcite ) as well as fully cosmological simulations @xcite have shown that binary gas - rich mergers can result in disc morphologies . hence",
    ", major mergers between gas - rich disc galaxies can possibly play an important role in the formation of a large number of the spiral galaxies we observe today .",
    "these facts bring an addition to the original scenario for the formation of disc galaxies , which involved the assembly of a halo of dark matter and ionized gas by hierarchical clustering and mergers of sub - halos , followed by the collapse and virialization of the dark matter halo , and finally the dissipative collapse of the baryonic component , resulting in a rotationally - supported disc , that will later fragment to form stars @xcite .",
    "one must also consider a formation scenario involving major collisions between spiral galaxies . the first numerical simulations of major collisions between disc galaxies were performed under the assumption that dissipation by gasdynamical effects was negligible .",
    "the results showed that the remaining galaxy had several properties attributed to elliptical galaxies , including luminosity profiles @xcite .",
    "even with the quite recent inclusion of feedback processes , the results remained mostly unchanged @xcite .",
    "minor collisions have also been studied in the past and results showed that this kind of collision tends to form galaxies whose disc is destroyed or very perturbed @xcite .",
    "all the aforementioned studies assumed a ratio gas / stars more representative of present low redshift mergers .",
    "of course , stars have not always been present inside galaxies .",
    "going back in time , we can expect to find fewer and fewer stars , and therefore a more important gaseous component @xcite .",
    "the milky way s thick disc is made predominantly of old stars , with ages in the range of @xmath7 , significantly older than the typical star found in the thin disc @xcite . the thick and thin disc differ in their structural , chemical , and kinematical properties : ( 1 ) the thick disc has a scale height of about 900 pc , compared to 300 pc for the thin disc @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the stars in the thick disc have a low metallicity , @xmath1\\sim-0.6 $ ] on average , and a ratio larger than the stars in the thin disc .",
    "( 3 ) stars in the thick disc tend to rotate slower than stars in the thin disc , by about @xmath8 @xcite and have an average vertical velocity dispersion of @xmath9 compared to @xmath10 for the stars in the thin disc @xcite .",
    "the formation of the milky way s thick disc remains an open question , with popular theories including the heating of a thin disc by minor mergers @xcite , or the direct accretion of stars , which are tidally torqued into the plane of the existing thin disc @xcite , or dynamical heating by destruction of very massive star clusters @xcite .",
    "we favor a scenario in which the milky way s thick disc is formed during the high - redshift epoch in which mergers are most common in @xmath2cdm , and accretion rates are high , with the disc which formed during this turbulent period being born thick ; the thin disc subsequently grows during the relatively quiescent period which follows , which in the case of the milky way is approximately the last 10 gyrs @xcite .",
    "recent observations suggest that all spiral galaxies are surrounded by a red , flattened envelope of stars , and these structures have been interpreted as showing that thick discs are ubiquitous in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence , understanding the formation of the thick disc will provide major insights into the formation processes of spiral galaxies .",
    "if we make the hypothesis that thick disc are formed during gas - rich major mergers , it would mean that a significant number of spiral galaxies have experienced major mergers .",
    "indeed , simulations have shown that gas - rich mergers tend to form two disc components ( @xcite ; b07 ) .",
    "these simulations included the effect of star formation and supernovae feedback , which allowed to study the kinematical and structural properties of galaxy merger remnants in detail .",
    "however , they did not include a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment and , therefore , could not predict the abundances of metals in stars and the interstellar medium ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* who studied the formation of ellipticals galaxies due to a more violent major merger ) .",
    "it is well - established that the thick disc of the milky way possesses a unique chemical signature , which is believed to be directly related to the formation process and it is important to analyze if the merger scenario for the formation of the thick disc component is compatible with these chemical signatures .",
    "this is the basis of our study here : we believe that the remnants of major mergers may be associated with a significant fraction of the `` red envelopes '' observed in @xcite , i.e. with extragalactic thick discs .",
    "since we expect the conditions for merging galaxies during hierarchical clustering at a high redshift to vary , we need to consider a wide range of parameters , such as mass ratio , orbit , and gas fraction of the merger progenitors . in this paper , we present a series of 8 simulations of mergers of gas - rich disc galaxies , with different mass ratios and orbital parameters .",
    "we analyze the kinematic and structural properties of the merger remnants .",
    "the results for one of the simulations have already been presented in a previous paper ( b07 ) .",
    "we now complete this work by presenting the entire suite of simulations .    for kinematic properties , we determine the relative importance of rotation and velocity dispersion in providing support .",
    "we also investigate if a counter - rotating component arises naturally in a gas - rich merger , as such components are observed in nature @xcite . for structural properties ,",
    "we determine if the luminosity profiles of these thick discs formed in major mergers follow an exponential law , and if so , what their respective scale lengths are .",
    "we determine if the thick and thin discs in merger remnants are coplanar , or if there is a significant angle between them , something that was not included in our previous work",
    ".    however , the main goal of the present paper is to study the viability of the merger mechanism for the formation of the thick disc from the chemical evolution s point of view , but without neglecting the kinematical and dynamical properties . with this in mind ,",
    "we choose initial conditions likely to produce a discy remnant .    in this paper , we use the numerical algorithm gcd+ , which includes a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment , to investigate whether key abundance ratios such as and in simulated remnants of gas - rich disc galaxy mergers have values and distributions similar to the ones found in the observed disc galaxies , including the milky way .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we briefly describe the numerical simulations employed , including the n - body / sph code adopted ( gcd+ ) , the initial conditions software ( galactics ) , and the basic parameters of our 8 realizations .",
    "the kinematical and structural properties of the merger remnants are presented in  3 and discussed in  4 .",
    "conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "all simulations were performed using gcd+ @xcite , self - consistently modeling the effects of gravity , gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation .",
    "gcd+ is a tree / sph algorithm that includes type  ia and type  ii sne feedback , and traces the lifetimes of individual stars , enabling us to monitor the chemical enrichment history of our simulated galaxies .",
    "star formation occurs in a convergent gas velocity field where gas density is greater than a critical density , @xmath11 .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of eligible gas particles is then @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a dimensionless star formation efficiency , and @xmath14 is the dynamical time .",
    "this formula corresponds to a schmidt law : sfr @xmath15 .",
    "the mass , energy , and heavy elements are smoothed over the neighboring gas particles using the sph smoothing kernel .",
    "the code separately tracks the abundances of 9 elements : h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , and fe . gas within the sph smoothing kernel of type  ii sne explosions is prevented from cooling , creating an adiabatic phase for gas heated by such sne .",
    "this adiabatic phase is assumed to last for the lifetime of the lowest mass star that ends as a type  ii sne , i.e. , the lifetime of an @xmath16 star ( 100 myr ) .",
    "this is similar to a model presented in @xcite .",
    "stellar yields are dependent of the progenitor mass and metallicity . for type  ii sne",
    ", we use the metallicity - dependent stellar yields of @xcite for stars with mass over @xmath17 , while for low- and intermediate - mass stars , we use the stellar yields of @xcite . for type  ia sne , we adopt the model of @xcite in which type  ia sne occur in binary systems with a primary star and a companion of a definite mass and metallicity range .",
    "the yields are from @xcite .",
    "note that gcd+ relaxes the instantaneous recycling approximation and takes into account the lifetime of progenitor stars , and chemical enrichment from intermediate mass stars .",
    "the code calculates , within each timestep , the amount of energy and heavy element released by every star particle and distributes them over the neighbours using the sph kernel for both type ii and ia sne .",
    "we did not include in the present paper any black hole feedback .",
    "several studies have demonstrated that this can be very important for the final morphology and the termination of the star formation in the merger remnant @xcite . however , the implementation of the blackhole feedback in numerical simulations is still highly ambiguous and we prefer here , for simplicity , to include only sn feedback . for more details about gcd+",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in each simulation , the initial conditions consist of two galaxies with exponential gas discs embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "these galaxies are generated using the galactics package @xcite , producing stable discs for a large number of galactic rotations .",
    "for the dark matter halos , galactics use the lowered evans model @xcite , which leads to a constant - density core .",
    "this model differs from models which have a steeper central density profile suggested by @xmath2cdm cosmological simulations @xcite . for our purpose",
    "this difference is not critical , as the central regions contain only a small fraction of the total mass .",
    "the star formation mechanism is shut down for the first @xmath18 enabling very gas - rich mergers . in our simulations ,",
    "the gas ratio immediately before merger is more relevant than the initial value .",
    "pure gas disc will induce an unrealistic starburst initially .",
    "however , by turning off star formation initially , we can control the gas fraction at the merger epoch . for each simulation ,",
    "the most massive galaxy ( gal1 ) has total mass of @xmath19 ( except for simulation m11 ) and a scale length of 4.5  kpc .",
    "the mass and scale length of the second galaxy ( gal2 ) depends on the specific mass ratio chosen for the simulation . using the observed gas fraction of galaxies at high @xcite and low @xcite redshift , @xcite",
    "provide a relation between gas fraction and redshift for galaxies of various masses .",
    "using this relation ( their equation  [ 1 ] ) allows us to estimate that the mergers in the epoch between @xmath20 would be between galaxies which have gas fractions as high as the ones used in our study .",
    "note that this is an upper bound of such epoch due to the fact that the high redshift observations of @xcite are considered lower bounds of the gas content .",

    "we can see this in our two simulations which formed bulge - dominated galaxies , namely m11 and m12z . explaining this difference is not simple because of the chaotic nature of the merger process .",
    "there is likely a complex relationship between the initial conditions and the behavior of the gas during the merger .",
    "the duration of the merger and the violence of the collision seems to favor a higher dynamical warming , and this favors the formation of a small rotationally supported disc , embedded within a large spheroidal component . in the case of simulation m11 , the two progenitors have a lower mass than in the others simulations , but the starburst has the same intensity . as a result , there is not enough gas left after the merger to form a substantial thin disc .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite who found that low - mass progenitors are more likely to form an important spheroidal component than high - mass ones .",
    "when a disc - like remnant is formed , it invariably consists of two disc components : a thick disc made of stars formed before or during the merger , and a thin disc made of stars born after the merger .",
    "the thick disc has a lower rotation velocity than the thin disc , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the scale - length ratio between the two components is also in agreement with this work , which suggests that gas - rich disc mergers may be a common way to form disc galaxies .",
    "however , we have to be careful since subsequent gas infall from satellites or the intergalactic medium is not included in our simulations",
    ". such gas infall could increase the scale - length of the thin disc and affect our results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stars belonging to the thick and thin discs differ by their abundances in various metals .",
    "old stars have an excess in @xmath51-elements relative to young stars at metallicities below @xmath60 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with observational studies on the chemical abundances of the two disc components of the milky way , if the old and young stars in our simulations are analogous to the thick- and thin - disc stars , respectively .",
    "@xcite published a spectroscopic survey of 176 stars with high probability to be part of the galactic thick disc , selected with the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "these authors analyze the relationship between the abundances of 22 chemical elements and the ratio .",
    "it is clear form their fig .",
    "12 that the ratio is higher for the thick disc than the thin disc by almost 0.15 until the metallicity reaches @xmath1=-0.3 $ ] . at larger metallicities ,",
    "the ratios of the two discs becomes similar .",
    "the authors explain this fact by invoking an extended period of enrichment in iron by type ia sne , an explanation that is supported by our work .",
    "16 in the same article shows that chemical elements other than the @xmath51-elements do not follow the same pattern , which is further evidence of the important role of type ii sne in the formation of the milky way , and support the scenario that a major collision took place in the history of the milky way .",
    "another similar study was done by @xcite .",
    "that study presents abundances for 102 dwarf f and g stars , and uses their kinematics to determine if they belong to the thin or thick disc . their fig .",
    "8 shows the abundances of oxygen , magnesium , and silicon as functions of metallicity , which indicates that that stars in the thick and thin disc have different abundances for a metallicity @xmath1<-0.5 $ ] .",
    "their fig .",
    "10 is particularly interesting and shows that the abundance of oxygen decreases with increasing metallicity in the interval @xmath61<0.0 $ ] .",
    "this is all in agreement with the results presented here .",
    "these authors suggest the existence of several observational constraints related to the formation and chemical evolution of the thick disc :    * thick - disc stars and thin - disc stars have different chemical abundances .",
    "* for a smaller than a certain value , thick disc stars have a larger abundance of @xmath51-elements than thin - disc stars .",
    "* the ratio decreases with increasing @xmath1 $ ] , which shows the important contribution of type  ia sne .",
    "* stars in the thick disc are on average older than stars in the thin disc .",
    "our results mostly agree with these constraints , which supports the gas - rich , major - collision scenario for the formation of the thick disc of the milky way , a scenario in which a collision leads to an intense starburst accompanied by a very large number of type  ii sne .",
    "these sne enrich the gas supply in @xmath51-elements , allowing the formation of stars with a high ratio .",
    "the starburst also leads to a progressive enrichment in iron caused by type  ia sne .",
    "stars formed after the collision will therefore have a smaller for the same metallicity .",
    "these stars will form a thin disc with a smaller velocity dispersion than the stars formed during the merger .",
    "another interesting result is the drop in with increasing radius .",
    "finally , we must point out that the initial conditions used in our study are greatly simplified .",
    "first , the initial conditions do not include a spheroidal component made of stars .",
    "we assume that the merger progenitors are pure disc for simplicity .",
    "we might expect that these stars , if included , would end up in the halo of the final galaxy , which might explain that most simulations produced a low - mass halo .",
    "we can argue that our results are valid in the limit where the initial spheroidal components are too small to affect the dynamics of the collision .",
    "we have not included a bulge component as well .",
    "although morphologies of high redshift galaxies are unknown , this assumption may be too simplistic and our results may be biased by this assumption . however , a recent work showed the presence of a bulge can produce a disc remnant with a gas ratio as low as 12% @xcite .",
    "these facts are an evidence that a merger between bulgeless disc - disc galaxies is not a sufficient condition to form a dick remnant .",
    "in fact , bulgeless mergers generally produce elliptical remnants in dissipationless simulations @xcite .",
    "so , the presence of a massive gaseous component is probably the major condition to reform a disc after a major merger .",
    "we also have to add that the softening length used in this study is slightly higher than what are used in the recent state - of - the - art simulations",
    ". however , the morphological aspects of our study show good agreement with previous such higher spatial resolution simulations , showing that the resolution is sufficient for the analysis presented in this paper .    the hierarchical model of structure formation normally includes a significant amount of collision and accretion of low - mass galaxies .",
    "it is presumptuous to assume that the formation of the thick disc can be explained entirely by one single collision .",
    "it is possible that several of these collisions take place in the initial phases of the formation of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our study can explain several observations with the important starburst that takes place during a major , gas - rich collision .",
    "using gcd+ , we have performed 8 simulations of major mergers between gas - rich spiral galaxies .",
    "we have analyzed the kinematic , structural , and chemical properties of stars formed before and during the collision ( the old population ) and stars formed after the collision ( the young population ) .",
    "we used the star formation rate to define these two populations .",
    "a fraction of the old stars end up in the halo of the merger remnant , while the remaining stars form a thick disc which is partly supported by velocity dispersion , partly supported by rotation , and sometimes includes a significant counter - rotating component .",
    "the young stars form a thin disc that is supported by rotation , and , in many cases , a ring that might or might not be coplanar with the thin disc . the disc themselves tend to be coplanar , the angle between them being @xmath62 or less . with rare exceptions , both discs are well - fitted by an exponential profile , and the scale - length of the thick disc exceeds the one of the thin disc a few percents up to a factor of 1.60 .    the starburst occurring during the collision",
    "rapidly enriches the gas in various metals .",
    "explosions of type  ii sne follow rapidly the start of the collision , owing to the short lifetime of their progenitors , and enrich the intergalactic medium in @xmath51-elements .",
    "enrichment by type  ia sne is spread over a large period of time , enabling the enrichment in iron of both stellar populations , which results in an old population having a ratio higher than the young population , even at relatively large metallicities ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this could explain the high ratio observed in stars in the thick disc and the halo of the milky way .",
    "this result do not depend strongly upon the initial conditions , since it was found in all simulations .",
    "our main conclusion is that the morphological , kinematical and chemical properties of the thick and thin disc can be reproduced in an scenario where thick disc formed in a gas rich merger between two disc galaxies .",
    "furthermore , while the structural and kinematical properties of the merger remnants are strongly dependent on the initial conditions features such as the ratio of the disc scale - lengths , the extent of the discs , the presence of rings or of a counter - rotating component , vary from simulation to simulation the chemical abundances show a remarkable consistency among the various simulations .",
    "the key result of this study is that the ratio remains constant with increasing for old stars , up to @xmath1=-0.5 $ ] while it decreases with increasing metallicity for young stars .",
    "this is true in each of the 8 simulations we considered .",
    "the observed chemical signatures in our merger remnants require that mergers happen before the onset of the majority of type  ia sne , regardless of the orbits or mass ratios of the progenitors .",
    "furthermore , the mergers need to be gas rich to lead to a remnant with a rotationally supported disc .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with the mergers we expect to find at high redshift and , therefore , our results support this scenario for the formation of the different disc components in the milky way .",
    "the simulations were performed at the laboratoire dastrophysique numrique , universit laval , the university of central lancashire s high performance computing facility , and at the center for computational astrophysics of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
