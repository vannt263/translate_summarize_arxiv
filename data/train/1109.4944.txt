    "emission from intergalactic gas is very faint and observations are currently mostly limited to low redshifts . at @xmath13 ly@xmath2 emission",
    "was recently seen out to @xmath14 kpc from star - forming galaxies in a stacking analysis by @xcite , and the origin of this light seems to be radiation of the central object scattered by galactic halo gas .",
    "however , these observations are limited to the immediate vicinity of galaxies , i.e.  @xmath15 , and are currently feasible only for the ly@xmath2 transition . on the other hand ,",
    "studying this gas in absorption is viable at all redshifts as long as there are sufficiently bright background objects .",
    "most importantly , absorption studies are sensitive to gas with several orders of magnitude lower density than emission studies .",
    "the background sources used for absorption line probes of the igm have traditionally been qsos , but one may also use background galaxies or gamma ray bursts . while the surface density of background galaxies is much higher than that of qsos ,",
    "the quality of the individual spectra is much lower , since at the redshifts discussed in this paper the typical background galaxy is @xmath16 times fainter than the brightest qsos .",
    "studies using galaxies as background sources are therefore confined to analyzing strong absorption lines and generally require stacking many lines of sight . on the other hand , qsos sufficiently bright for high - resolution , high s / n spectroscopy using 8m - class telescopes are exceedingly rare , but the information obtained from a single line of sight is of exceptional quality , well beyond what could be obtained with even the very brightest galaxy at comparable redshift .",
    "we note also that galaxies and qsos do not provide identical information , as the former are much more extended than the latter .",
    "this is particularly relevant for metal lines , which often arise in absorbers with sizes that are comparable or smaller than the half - light radii of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we focus on studying the igm near star - forming galaxies at @xmath17 using absorption spectra of background qsos . at present",
    "we focus on ly@xmath2  in the vicinity of galaxies , while a future paper will study the relation between metals and galaxies .",
    "star - forming galaxies in this redshift range can be detected very efficiently based on their rest - frame uv colors @xcite and the same redshift range is ideal for studying many astrophysically interesting lines that lie in the rest - frame uv part of the spectrum ( e.g. ly@xmath2 at 1215.67 , civ @xmath18 1548.19,1550.77  , ovi @xmath181031.93,1037.616  , where the civ and ovi lines are doublets ) . at these redshifts",
    "the ly@xmath2 forest is not as saturated as at @xmath19 , and at the same time the absorption systems are not as rare as they are at low redshifts .",
    "in addition , this redshift range is exceptionally well - suited for studying the galaxy - igm interface given that this is when the universal star formation rate was at its peak ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and hence we expect the interaction between galaxies and their surroundings to be most vigorous .",
    "the largest qso - galaxy surveys at high redshift are those from @xcite and @xcite , and here we will briefly describe the former given that it is the most comparable in terms of the galaxy sampling density and data quality to the study presented in this paper .",

    "@xcite also used hires spectra , but at @xmath29 the surface density of galaxies with @xmath30 is @xmath31 times smaller than at @xmath32 , and the qso spectra did not cover higher order lyman lines , which are important for the recovery of optical depths in saturated ly@xmath2 lines .",

    ". the qso redshift distribution can be seen in figure  [ redshift ] and a summary of the properties of the final spectra is given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the redshift range that we consider when studying ly@xmath2 absorption in the spectrum of a qso at redshift @xmath72 is given by equation  ( [ eq : zrange ] ) .",
    "the lower limit ensures that only ly@xmath2 redwards of the qso s ly@xmath75 emission line is considered , thus avoiding any confusion with the ly@xmath75 forest from gas at higher redshifts .",
    "the upper limit is set to avoid contamination of the ly@xmath2 forest by material associated with the qso and to avoid the qso proximity effect .",
    "we verified that excluding 5,000 rather than 3,000 @xmath110 gives nearly identical results .    the median s / n in the ly@xmath2 forest regions of the spectra ranges from 42 to 163 ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "a number of qso spectra ( 5 out of 15 ) contain damped lyman-@xmath2 systems ( dlas ) and sub - dlas within the considered redshift range .",
    "we divided out the damping wings after fitting the voigt profiles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details on this procedure ) .",
    "the saturated cores of the ( sub-)dlas were , however , flagged and excluded from the analysis , but this does not have a significant effect on our results .",
    "the goal of the pixel optical depth ( pod ) method is to use automatic algorithms ( as opposed to manual fits ) to find the best estimate of the optical depth of the ly@xmath2 absorption line and those of various metal transitions as a function of redshift . obtaining accurate pixel optical depths",
    "can be challenging due to the presence of noise , errors in the continuum fit , contamination and saturation .",
    "it is more instructive to plot optical depths than normalized fluxes because the optical depth is proportional to the column density of the absorbing species , while the flux is exponentially sensitive to this density .",
    "hence , a power - law column density profile translates into a power - law optical depth profile and a lognormal column density distribution becomes a lognormal optical depth distribution .",
    "the shapes of the profiles and distributions common in nature are therefore preserved , which is not the case if we work with the flux . of course ,",
    "if the spectral resolution is coarser than the typical line width , or if the wavelength coverage does not allow for the use of weaker components of multiplets to measure the optical depth of saturated lines , then the interpretation of the recovered optical depths is more complicated .",
    "our spectral resolution is , however , sufficient to resolve the ly@xmath2 lines and our wavelength coverage is sufficient to recover the optical depth of most saturated lines .",
    "another advantage of optical depths is that their dynamic range is unconstrained , whereas the normalized flux is confined to vary between zero and one .",
    "the large dynamic range does imply that one must use median rather than mean statistics , because the mean optical depth merely reflects the high optical depth tail of the distribution .",
    "while this problem could also be solved by using the mean logarithm of the optical depth , that would not resolve another issue resulting from the large intrinsic dynamic range : the observed optical depth distribution is cut off at the low absorption end by noise and at the high end by line saturation ( and thus ultimately also by noise ) .",
    "however , errors in the tails of the distribution do not matter if we use median statistics ( or other percentiles , provided they stay away from the noise ) .",
    "the pod statistics method was introduced by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and further improved by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the pod method used in this study is the one developed and tested by @xcite , and is identical to that of @xcite for the case of ly@xmath2 .",
    "the ly@xmath2 optical depth in each pixel is calculated from the normalized flux @xmath120 , @xmath121 pixels with @xmath122 ( which can occur in the presence of noise ) are assigned an optical depth of @xmath123 , which is smaller than any recovered optical depth .",
    "pixels that have @xmath124 are considered saturated , where @xmath125 is the rms noise amplitude at the given pixel and @xmath126 is a parameter that we set to 3 ( see aguirre , schaye & theuns , 2002 for more details ) .",
    "one advantage of the pod method is that it is easy to recover a good estimate of the ly@xmath127 optical depth in these saturated pixels by using the available higher order lyman lines .",
    "the recovered ly@xmath2 optical depth is then given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the oscillator strength of the @xmath130th order lyman line and @xmath131 is its rest wavelength ( @xmath132 corresponds to @xmath2 , @xmath133 to @xmath75 , etc . ) .",
    "taking the minimum optical depth ( equation  [ eq : hoeq ] ) minimizes the effect of contamination by other lines .",
    "higher order lines used for ly@xmath2 optical depth recovery are those that lie in the wavelength range of the spectrum , and for which @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the noise at @xmath131 .",
    "if none of the available higher order lines satisfy this criterion , or if none of the higher order lines are available , then the pixel is set to a high optical depth ( we use @xmath136 ) .",
    "an example of the recovered optical depth in one qso spectrum is shown in figure  [ taulbg ] , together with the positions of galaxies in the same field .",
    "setting pixels to @xmath137 and @xmath138 allows them to correctly influence the median and other percentiles .",
    "the actual values they are set to are unimportant as long as @xmath139 for the percentile of interest . in other words , as long as the @xmath137 or @xmath138 are on the same side of a given percentile as the true optical depth that they are replacing , their actual values are unimportant .",
    "we use the pod method because : a ) it is fast , robust , and automatic , which means it can deal with large amounts of data , both observed and simulated ; b ) it makes it straightforward to exploit the full dynamic range measurable from our spectra ; c ) the fact that the optical depth is directly proportional to the column density of neutral hydrogen makes it easy to interpret the results ( see  [ interpretation ] ) . while the pod method has clear advantages , it is important to note that it does not replace the more traditional method of decomposing the absorption spectra into voigt profile components .",
    "for example , in its simplest form , the pod method does not make direct use of information about the line widths , which are clearly of interest as they contain important information about the temperature and the small - scale velocity structure of the absorbing gas .",
    "an analysis of the kbss data based on voigt profile decompositions is presented in @xcite .",
    "after recovering the optical depths in each pixel of a qso spectrum , we can build a map of the galaxies average surroundings , as a function of the transverse distance from the line of sight ( los ) , i.e.   the impact parameter , and the velocity separation from the galaxy along the los .",
    "we sometimes convert velocity separation into distance by assuming that it is due to the hubble flow .",
    "however , as we will show in sections  [ 2ddistribution ] and [ sec : distortions ] , this is a poor approximation at small velocity differences from galaxies",
    ". we will refer to distances computed under the assumption of zero peculiar velocities ( and zero redshift errors ) as  hubble distances \" .",
    "different galaxies and qso fields are combined , meaning that the median pod for a given impact parameter and velocity difference is estimated over all galaxies irrespective of which field they come from , without applying any weighting .",
    "each galaxy therefore provides an array of pixels with varying velocity difference but fixed impact parameter .    for reference",
    ", we note that 0.2 , 2.1 , and 9.9 percent of the pixels in our sample are at 3-d hubble distances smaller than 200 , 500 , and 1000 pkpc , respectively .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ 2ddifferentialfixed ] shows the logarithm of the median @xmath140 as a function of the transverse and the los separations from galaxies .",
    "the distance bin size in this plot is 200 by 200 pkpc ( which corresponds to @xmath141 along the los ) , and the image has been smoothed with a 2-d gaussian with fwhm equal to the bin size .",
    "note that we take a galaxy - centered approach in constructing this image .",
    "each galaxy contributes a column of pixels whose position along the @xmath142-axis corresponds to the galaxy s impact parameter .",
    "a single pixel can be used multiple times : once for each galaxy whose separation from the pixel falls within the range plotted .",
    "this is the first published 2-d absorption map around galaxies .",
    "studies by e.g. @xcite and @xcite show cross - correlation maps of galaxies with ly@xmath2 absorption systems , which is not equivalent .",
    "the map shows a strong correlation between the ly@xmath2 absorption strength and the distance to the galaxies .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ 2ddifferentialfixed ] shows the same data , after randomizing the galaxy redshifts .",
    "we randomize the galaxy redshifts within the ly@xmath2 forest region of each qso spectrum while keeping their impact parameters unchanged in order to preserve the number of pixels per galaxy . in this way we can estimate the magnitude of the fluctuations in the absence of correlations between the locations of galaxies and absorbers .",
    "we can see that the signal is lost , which implies that the features seen in the left panel are real .",
    "finally , we note that because a single galaxy contributes a full column of pixels at its impact parameter , bins along the los are somewhat correlated .",

    "the smearing in the los direction manifests itself as enhanced absorption at small impact parameters relative to the signal at small los separations . the confidence level associated with the detected discrepancy between the two directions , which we estimate as the fraction of bootstrap realizations in which the sign of the discrepancy is reversed , is at least 99% for each data point out to 1  pmpc ( i.e.  points 27 of the first panel ) .",

    "however , this does not prove the observed elongation along the los is due to redshift errors rather than peculiar velocities .",
    "in fact , since the elongation is more extended than the typical redshift errors ( @xmath246 vs.  @xmath92 ) , but similar to the expected circular velocities ( @xmath247 ) , it is likely that the finger of god effect is dominated by small - scale peculiar velocity gradients due to virial motions , infall , and/or outflows .",

    "the last black square in the first panel is an outlier , but note that it is based on only 16 galaxies , whereas the same points in panels 5 - 9 are based on 49217 galaxies .",
    "indeed , according to the redshift randomization method described in the next section , the last black square in the first panel is only a 1.8@xmath235 outlier , whereas the last red circles of panels 1 - 6 ( or , equivalently , the first 6 black squares in the last panel ) represent detections of excess absorption with significance varying between 2.6@xmath235 and @xmath264 .",
    "the median log(@xmath265 ) and 1@xmath235 confidence intervals from figure  [ 2ddifferentiallog ] are tabulated in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "figure  [ hubble ] shows the median @xmath266 optical depth in radial bins around the galaxy positions , where we assumed that velocity differences between absorbers and galaxies are entirely due to the hubble flow .",
    "we emphasize that figures  [ 2ddifferentiallog ] and [ 2dcuts ] show that this is not a good approximation , particularly for distances @xmath267pmpc .",
    "it does , however , provide us with a compact way to present a lot of information .",
    "the 3-d hubble distance , as we call it , is therefore just @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the galaxy s impact parameter , @xmath270 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath238 is the velocity separation between an absorber and the galaxy . as mentioned in section  [ galaxies ] , we use only galaxies with impact parameters smaller than 2 pmpc , even when making figure  [ hubble ] .",
    "hence , distances @xmath271 pmpc reflect mostly los separations .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the median level of absorption in the ly@xmath2 forest pixels .",
    "the significance of the excess absorption can be estimated by comparing the error bars , which indicate the @xmath272 confidence intervals determined by bootstrap resampling the galaxies , to the difference between the data points and the horizontal dashed line .",
    "more precisely , we can estimate the confidence level associated with the detection of excess absorption as @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the fraction of 1,000 bootstrap realizations for which the data point falls below the dashed line .",
    "this method indicates that within 2.8 pmpc excess absorption is detected with greater than 99.7% significance ( i.e.  @xmath3 ) . for 2.8",
    " 4.0 pmpc the significance is 87% ( i.e.  @xmath275 ) , while the absorption is consistent with random beyond 4  pmpc .    the dotted curve and the right @xmath276-axis show the number of galaxies contributing to each bin .",
    "since the inner few bins contain only a few tens of galaxies each ( 14 for the first bin ) , the bootstrap errors may not be reliable for these bins .",
    "the significance of the excess of absorption can be estimated more robustly by making use of the fact that each qso spectrum provides many independent spectral regions at the impact parameter of each galaxy .",
    "we can do this by comparing the excess absorption to the grey region , which indicates the @xmath272 detection threshold and which was determined by re - measuring the median @xmath277 after randomizing the galaxy redshifts ( while keeping the impact parameters fixed ) .",
    "the grey shaded region shows the @xmath272 confidence interval obtained after doing this 1,000 times . for each distance bin , the confidence level of the detection",
    "is then given by @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the fraction of realizations resulting in a median optical depth that is higher than actually observed .",
    "in agreement with the errors estimated by bootstrap resampling the galaxies , we find that the significance is @xmath280% within 2.8  pmpc and that there is no evidence for excess absorption beyond 4  pmpc . for 2.84.0 pmpc",
    "the significance of the detection is , however , larger than before : 99.2% ( i.e.  @xmath281 ) .",
    "we conclude that the absorption is significantly enhanced out to at least 3  pmpc proper , which is @xmath282  cmpc .",
    "the fact that the absorption is enhanced out to several pmpc is in good agreement with @xcite , who measured the mean flux as a function of 3-d hubble distance .",
    "however , the profile measured by @xcite is much flatter . converting their data into optical depths ,",
    "they measure @xmath283 in their innermost bin , which extends to about 200  pkpc .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude lower than our median recovered optical depth at this distance .",
    "conversely , at large distances their mean flux asymptotes to 0.765 , or @xmath284 , which is much higher than our asymptotic median optical depth of @xmath285 , even though we measure a similar mean flux of 0.806 , or @xmath286 .",
    "thus , our dynamic range is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of @xcite .",
    "this difference arises because we use median optical depth rather than mean flux statistics and because we use higher order lyman lines to recover the optical depth in saturated lines .",
    "the dashed curves show the 15.9% and 84.1% percentiles , indicating the @xmath272 scatter in the pods ( which is obviously much larger than the error in the median ) .",
    "it is important to note that , except on the smallest scales ( @xmath287 pkpc ) , the scatter is similar to or larger than the median excess absorption .",
    "hence , there will be a wide range of pods for all separations probed here .",
    "finally , the blue line shows the best - fit power - law through the data points , @xmath288 where we required the fit to asymptote to the median of all pixels ( horizontal , dashed line in figure  [ hubble ] ) .      in this section we will show that the results we presented ( 2-d and 3-d absorption profiles ) are robust to changes in the s / n ratio of the qso spectra , to the omission of nirspec or non - nirspec redshifts , to the exact redshift calibration , and , for optical depths @xmath289 , to the use of higher order lyman lines .",
    "we have chosen to demonstrate this using the plots of median absorption versus 3-d hubble distance , because these offer a compact summary of the data .    in the left panel of figure  [ hubblevariations ]",
    "we compare the median ly@xmath2 absorption as a function of 3-d hubble distance for the lower and higher s / n subsamples of the qso spectra ( with median s / n ratios of @xmath290 and @xmath291 respectively ) .",
    "it appears that better data yields slightly more absorption at 3-d hubble distances of @xmath292  pmpc , but the differences are not significant .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ hubblevariations ] compares the subset of 71 galaxies for which redshifts have been measured from nebular emission lines using the nirspec instrument ( red circles ) with the default sample ( grey curve ) as well as with the result obtained when we ignore the nirspec redshifts and instead use ly@xmath2  emission and/or interstellar absorption redshifts measured from lris spectra for all galaxies ( black squares ) . as discussed in sections  [ redshifts ] and appendix  [ sec : zerrors ] , the redshifts estimated from the nirspec spectra have errors of @xmath293 , while the redshifts estimated from lris spectra typically have @xmath294 . in figure  [ hubblevariations ]",
    "we see that the signal appears to drop slightly more steeply for the nirspec subsample , as would be expected given the smaller redshift errors , but both the nirspec and pure - lris samples are consistent with the default sample .",
    "we note that for ly@xmath2  emission and interstellar absorption we also tried using the redshift calibrations from @xcite and @xcite instead of the one from @xcite .",
    "for @xcite the signal tends to be slightly stronger and the bootstrap errors slightly smaller , but the differences are small compared with the errors ( not shown ) .",
    "one of the advantages of the pod method is the possibility to recover the optical depth in the saturated ly@xmath2 pixels by using higher order lyman lines .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ hubblevariations ] shows the effect of omitting this feature of the pod method .",
    "the two curves are nearly identical except for the first two bins , @xmath295  pmpc , where the median optical depths increase from @xmath296 when we make use of higher order lines to @xmath297 when we do not .",
    "the latter value is not meaningful as it is the optical depth that we assign to pixels for which saturation prevents recovery of the optical depth ( see  [ pod ] ) . without higher order lines",
    ", we can not constrain the flux to be much smaller than the s / n ratio , which in our case corresponds to optical depths of about 45 .    hence , measuring the median optical depth in the circumgalactic region requires the use of higher order lines , but the recovery of the optical depth in saturated pixels appears to be unimportant at large distances .",
    "this is , however , only true if we restrict ourselves to median statistics . as we will see in sections  [ cgm_scatter ] and",
    "[ sec : coldflows ] , higher order lines are also crucial at large distances if we are interested in the pdf of pixel optical depths .      figure  [ 2ddifferentiallog ] shows that absorption signal is smeared out over @xmath240  pmpc ( i.e.  @xmath298 ) in the los direction .",
    "indeed , for all panels of figure  [ 2dcuts ] the first 6 bins along the los ( black squares ) , which correspond to velocities @xmath299 , are consistent with each other at the @xmath272 level .",
    "this velocity is slightly larger than the expected redshift errors and similar to the expected circular velocities of the halos hosting our galaxies . because there is no evidence for structure in the velocity direction on scales @xmath299 and",
    "because the errors are strongly correlated for smaller velocity differences ( see appendix  [ rankcorrelation ] ) , it makes sense to group these first 6 los bins together and measure the absorption as a function of transverse distance .",
    "the result is shown as the blue squares in figure  [ hubble_td ] ( all data from this figure is tabulated in table  [ tbl-3 ] ) , which shows the 3-d hubble distance results for comparison ( grey circles ) .    estimating the errors by bootstrapping galaxies , we find that excess absorption is detected with @xmath300 confidence over the full range of impact parameters .",
    "using the more robust method of randomizing galaxy redshifts , we find that the significance is at least @xmath301 for all but the second point ( 0.130.18  pmpc ) , which is based on only 8 galaxies and for which the significance is only @xmath302 .",
    "as expected , the hubble and transverse results converge at large distances , where redshift space distortions are small ) . ] .",
    "they also agree at very small distances ( first bin ; @xmath303  pmpc ) , because a small 3-d hubble distance implies that the transverse distance must also be small ( note that the reverse is not true since galaxies with small impact parameters contribute pixels with large los separations ) . on intermediate scales , however , the two measures of distance yield significantly different results , with the absorption at fixed 3-d hubble distance being stronger than that at the same fixed transverse distance . in particular , while the transverse direction shows a rapid fall off at @xmath304pmpc followed by a constant excess absorption out to 2  pmpc , the absorption decreases smoothly with 3-d hubble distance .    because of redshift space distortions , it is not possible to measure the absorption as a function of the true , 3-d distance . however , we expect the true result to be in between the transverse and hubble results shown in figure  [ hubble_td ] .",
    "the 3-d hubble distance may overestimate the true distance on intermediate scales , because it assumes all velocity differences to be due to the hubble flow , whereas in reality redshift errors and peculiar velocities will contribute .",
    "note , however , that infall of the right magnitude could lead the 3-d hubble distances to underestimate the true distances . on the other hand , because we group los separations of @xmath305 , the transverse distance will typically underestimate the true distance on intermediate scales because it implicitly assumes that the contribution of the hubble flow is negligible up to velocity differences of @xmath306 .",
    "however , we chose to average over this velocity difference with good reason : within @xmath307 the signal is independent of velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ 2dcuts ] ) and the errors are strongly correlated ( appendix  [ rankcorrelation ] ) , which suggests that the velocities are not dominated by the hubble flow .",

    "the dashed curve shows the result if we convert the recovered optical depths into overdensities using the fit to hydrodynamical simulations given in @xcite for @xmath354 .",
    "the relation provided by those authors was obtained by producing mock ly@xmath2 absorption spectra for sight lines through a hydrodynamical simulation , scaling the simulated spectra to fit the observed mean flux decrement , and then fitting the relation between the ly@xmath2 optical depth - weighted overdensity of gas responsible for the absorption in each pixel and the recovered ly@xmath2 pod in that pixel .",
    "the agreement between the hydrodynamical simulation and the jeans method is clearly excellent .",
    "we conclude that typical gas overdensities decrease from @xmath355 at distances @xmath356  pkpc , which is similar to the virial radii of the halos hosting our galaxies , to @xmath240 at @xmath240  pmpc .",
    "the steepness of the drop at intermediate scales is uncertain due to redshift space distortions , but it is likely to be bracketed by the the middle and right panels of figure  [ hubbleoverdensity ] . observe that on large scales the overdensity asymptotes to values smaller than unity .",
    "this is expected , as the median optical depth is a volume weighted measure rather than a mass - weighted measure .",
    "while the mass - weighted mean overdensity is by definition unity , the volume - weighted mean overdensity is smaller because underdense regions dominate the volume .",
    "as most of the pathlength in the ly@xmath2 forest is across voids , the median density inferred from the ly@xmath2 forest is less than 1 .",
    "the difference between volume and mass - weighted quantities probably also accounts for the relatively low overdensity measured around the virial radius ( @xmath357  pmpc ) .",
    "the smallest impact parameter in our sample is @xmath249 pkpc .",
    "it is difficult to probe scales smaller than this with qso - galaxy pairs owing to the small number of bright qsos and the rarity of close pairs , as well as to the difficulty of observing objects right in front of a bright qso . for such small scales",
    "it is therefore more efficient to resort to using galaxies as background objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , in this section we will use our sample of background qsos to study the gas within transverse distances of 200 pkpc of galaxies .",
    "but before doing so , we will compare our results with the small - scale data from @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured ly@xmath2 rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of distance from the same sample of galaxies that we study here . since they used background galaxy spectra for probing foreground galaxies circumgalactic matter , they were able to study smaller scales than we can probe with the qso spectra .",
    "while they could measure the ew in a stack of background galaxy spectra , the spectral resolution of the galaxy spectra was too low to measure column densities or resolved pixel optical depths and the s / n was too low to obtain ew measurements for individual galaxies .",
    "the red circles in figure  [ ew ] show their measurements at small impact parameters and the blue circles show their measurements using qso spectra , together with our ew measurements from qso spectra at larger impact parameters ( black squares ) .",
    "although we used the same data , their technique for measuring ew differs from ours ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "we computed the ews as follows .",
    "we shifted the spectra into the rest - frame of each galaxy within a given impact parameter bin , found the mean flux profile , divided it by the mean flux level of all pixels in the spectra ( i.e.  0.804 ) in order to mimic the effect of continuum fitting low - quality spectra , and integrated the flux decrement over @xmath358 centered on the galaxies positions .",
    "we verified that using a larger velocity interval ( @xmath359 ) gives consistent results .",
    "it appears that the absorption strength falls off according to a power law , out to @xmath360 pkpc . beyond this impact",
    "parameter the relation flattens off at ew@xmath361   .",
    "@xcite found that the absorption near galaxies follows a bimodal distribution . while the flux decrement is usually large , @xmath362 of galaxies",
    "are not associated with strong ly@xmath2 absorption within a 3-d hubble distance of 1  @xmath363  pmpc ( i.e.  @xmath364 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : scatter ] , we also find that the absorption varies strongly from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "however , we showed that this is not only true near galaxies , but also if we look in random places of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the distribution of median optical depths is not bimodal .",
    "as @xcite did not measure optical depths , we show the distribution of the median flux decrement for impact parameters @xmath365 and velocity differences @xmath366 from galaxies in the left panel of figure  [ histogramgalaxy200kpc ] . for comparison ,",
    "the right panel shows the corresponding median optical depths . as before , we chose this velocity interval because there is little structure in the median profiles for velocity separations smaller than this value ( see figs .",
    "[ 2ddifferentiallog ] and [ 2dcuts ] ) , which is not surprising given that @xmath367 is similar to both the redshift errors and the circular velocities of the halos thought to host the galaxies .",
    "the blue curves show the results for randomized galaxy redshifts , where we assign random redshifts ( within the ly@xmath2 forest redshift range ) to the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the curves are the result of estimating a histogram for randomized redshifts 1,000 times , and taking the mean median in each bin .",
    "a k - s test shows that the two distributions are discrepant at the @xmath368 level , so the absorption is clearly enhanced near galaxies .",
    "it can be seen in the left panel that galaxies either show very little transmission , or relatively high flux .",
    "the flux distribution is thus bimodal , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however , the right panel shows that there is no evidence for bimodality of the optical depth distribution .",
    "hence , the bimodality seen in the left panel is a consequence of the mapping @xmath369 which bunches the low ( high ) optical depth tail of the distribution together at a flux decrement of zero ( one ) .",
    "note that the shape of the optical depth distribution ( which appears to be approximately lognormal ) is physically more relevant than that of the flux , because the former is proportional to the neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "we will demonstrate next that the scatter is not random as the optical depth is strongly anti - correlated with the impact parameter .      in recent years",
    "cosmological simulations and theoretical models have converged on the idea that gas accretion is bimodal .",
    "while the gas accreting onto massive halos is shock - heated to the virial temperature , in lower mass halos most of the gas falls in cold ( @xmath370k ) .",
    "the cold mode feeds the galaxy through filaments ( cold streams ) whereas the hot mode results in the formation of a hydrostatic halo which fuels the galaxy through a cooling flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the optical depth is strongly anti - correlated with the distance to the nearest galaxy .",
    "pixels with @xmath406 , are closer to galaxies than a random place in the universe is , while pixels with @xmath407 are on average farther from galaxies than a random location is .    to provide some physical interpretation of this observed trend we use the jeans approximation described in section  [ interpretation ] to convert optical depths into estimates for the gas overdensities ( implicitly smoothed on the scale of the absorbers , i.e.  @xmath146  pkpc ) ( top @xmath142-axis ) .",
    "gas at the mean density of the universe would produce log@xmath408 and is thus typically closer to galaxies than a random place in the universe .",
    "although it is unclear whether we can estimate the overdensity sufficiently accurately for this statement to be reliable , it would in fact not be a surprising result .",
    "because voids take up most of the volume , a random place in the universe will be underdense .",
    "if we cube the normalized distance to the nearest galaxy , then we get something close to the inverse of the overdensity of galaxies",
    ". however , in that case the scale over which this number density is measured , would be the distance to the nearest galaxy and would thus vary with the density itself .",
    "it is more instructive to measure the overdensity of galaxies on a fixed length scale , which is something we can also measure from our data .    in figure  [ meangalaxydensity ]",
    "we show the mean overdensity of galaxies in our sample as a function of pixel optical depth , evaluated on ( 3-d hubble ) scales of 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 pmpc around them ( tabulated in table  [ tbl-4 ] ) .",
    "note that these galaxy number densities can not be directly compared with the gas overdensities that we can estimate from the optical depths because they are evaluated over different length scales .",
    "the galaxy number density increases with increasing optical depth , and the density contrast is stronger when it is measured on smaller scales .",
    "for example , pixels with @xmath409 ( at @xmath0 ) see on average a galaxy overdensity @xmath410 within 8 pmpc , but an overdensity @xmath296 within 0.25 pmpc .",
    "pixels with @xmath411 typically reside in regions where the galaxy number density is close to the cosmic mean on scales @xmath10  pmpc .",
    "because galaxies are clustered , this implies that for such pixels the distance to the nearest galaxy will typically be smaller than it is for a random place in the universe ( see fig .",
    "[ nearestgalaxy ] ) .",
    "given that we have both measurements of the galaxy number density and estimates of the gas overdensities , we could attempt to estimate the bias of these two components relative to each other by computing the ratio of the two densities . however , the length scale over which gas densities corresponding to ly@xmath2 absorbers are implicitly smoothed ( i.e.  the local jeans scale in case of overdense gas ; * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper we studied the galaxy - igm interface at @xmath444 in the 15 fields of the keck baryonic structure survey . each kbss field",
    "is centered on a very bright background qso of which high s / n , high resolution spectra have been obtained , and includes a densely - sampled galaxy survey optimized to sample the same range of redshifts probed by the igm measurements .",
    "our analysis has included a total of 679 galaxies , the subset of the larger kbss sample that lies in the appropriate range of redshifts within 2pmpc of the corresponding qso sightline .",
    "the redshifts of 71 of our galaxies were measured directly from nebular lines observed in the near - ir , while the remaining redshifts were derived from ism absorption and/or ly@xmath2  emission lines and the redshift calibration of @xcite .",
    "the median redshift of our galaxies is 2.36 .",
    "we analyzed the spectra using the pixel optical depth method , which uses an automatic algorithm to recover the ly@xmath2  optical depth in each pixel , making use of higher order lyman lines to recover the optical depth in pixels with saturated ly@xmath2  absorption .",
    "our analysis relied almost entirely on median statistics .",
    "because the ly@xmath2  optical depth is proportional to the column density of neutral hydrogen , its distribution is physically more relevant than that of the flux .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows ( as before , all distances are proper ) :    * we presented the first 2-d map of absorption around galaxies , showing the median ly@xmath2  optical depth as a function of transverse and los separations . by converting velocity differences along the los into distances assuming pure hubble flow ,",
    "redshift space distortions show up as anisotropies in the absorption maps .",
    "* hydrogen ly@xmath2 absorption is strongly enhanced near galaxies . within @xmath445pkpc",
    "the median optical depth is @xmath271 orders of magnitude higher than in a random place ( @xmath446 versus @xmath447 ) . * two types of anisotropies",
    "are clearly detected : 1 .   on scales",
    "@xmath448 , or @xmath449 pmpc , the median absorption is significantly stronger , by @xmath450 orders of magnitude , along the los than in the transverse direction .",
    "we showed that although this  finger of god \" effect may be explained by galaxy redshift errors , it is probably dominated by peculiar velocities of gas within and around the halos .",
    "2 .   on scales of @xmath451 pmpc",
    "the absorption is significantly stronger ( with @xmath264 significance ) in the transverse direction than along the los .",
    "we interpret this compression in the los direction as large - scale infall towards the potential wells occupied by the galaxies , i.e. the @xcite effect . to our knowledge , this is the first time that this signature of gravitational collapse has been detected for gas . *",
    "the median optical depth as a function of impact parameter ( over @xmath452 intervals around galaxies ) drops by more than an order of magnitude going from @xmath326 pmpc to @xmath453 pmpc and remains approximately constant thereafter out to at least 2  pmpc , where it is still a factor of two higher than in a random part of the spectrum .",
    "the sharp transition occurs at a radius that is similar to the virial radius of the halos that are thought to host the galaxies . *",
    "the median optical depth as a function of 3-d hubble distance ( i.e.  the 3-d distance computed under the assumption of pure hubble flow ) shows no steep drop at @xmath334 pkpc . instead , it decreases smoothly away from galaxies .",
    "the lack of a steep drop reflects the fact that 3-d hubble distances of a few times @xmath334 pkpc mix strong absorption arising at impact parameters @xmath454 pkpc with the mostly weaker absorption at larger transverse separations . *",
    "excess absorption is detected with @xmath3 significance out to 2.0  pmpc in the transverse direction . in terms of the 3-d hubble distance",
    "the significance is @xmath3 out to 2.8 pmpc and @xmath455 for 2.8 to 4 pmpc . *",
    "the median optical depth near galaxies with a fixed impact parameter is highly variable , suggesting that the gas is clumpy .",
    "the scatter in the median optical depth at fixed impact parameter is @xmath456 dex . beyond 100 pkpc",
    "this is large compared with the excess median absorption . * converting optical depths to column densities",
    ", we estimate that the median neutral hydrogen column density decreases from @xmath457 within @xmath334 pkpc to @xmath458 for larger impact parameters .",
    "we note that if we had selected the strongest absorber within @xmath334 pkpc of each galaxy , instead of taking all the pixels within that distance into account , the median column density of so selected systems would have been substantially higher . * converting optical depths into overdensities ( implicitly smoothed on the scale of the absorbers , i.e.  @xmath445pkpc ) by applying the  jeans \" approximation @xcite , the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a fit to a hydrodynamical simulations @xcite all yield similar results , with the jeans approximation and the hydro simulation agreeing particularly well .",
    "we estimate that median gas overdensities decrease from @xmath355 within @xmath334 pkpc to @xmath459 at 1 pmpc . beyond this impact",
    "parameter the overdensity asymptotes to values smaller than unity , which is expected because underdense regions dominate the volume and gas densities inferred from optical depths are volume rather than mass weighted . * the covering fraction of absorbers with median optical depth @xmath394 within @xmath460 is @xmath461 for @xmath462 pkpc and @xmath7 for @xmath463 pkpc .",
    "if we use the maximum rather than the median optical depth than the latter fraction increases to @xmath395 . * by turning to a pixel - centric view , i.e.  estimating the median distance to the nearest galaxy as a function of the pixel s optical depth , we show that absorbers with @xmath464 are typically closer to galaxies than a random location in the universe , while weaker absorbers are farther from galaxies compared to random .",
    "* the average number density of galaxies around absorbers increases with increasing absorption strength , and the galaxy density contrast is higher when it is evaluated on smaller scales .",
    "for example , on scales of 0.25 pmpc the galaxy overdensity increases from @xmath465 at @xmath466 to @xmath240 at @xmath467 and to @xmath296 at @xmath403 . when evaluated in spheres with radius of 2 pmpc the galaxy overdensity increases from @xmath468 at @xmath469 to @xmath410 for @xmath470 .",
    "absorbers with @xmath9 reside in regions where the galaxy number density is close to the cosmic mean on scales @xmath10 pmpc . as",
    "most of the volume is underdense , such absorbers are nearer to galaxies than a random place in the universe is .",
    "this work could be improved considerably by reducing the redshift errors , which will be possible through observations of nebular emission lines with the new multi - object near - ir spectrograph keck",
    "i / mosfire @xcite .",
    "such observations would also allow us to investigate whether the absorption varies with the properties of the galaxies such as their stellar masses or star formation rates .    in a future paper we will present a comparison of our observational findings with cosmological , hydrodynamical simulations , which will aid the interpretation of the absorption profiles that we see around galaxies .",
    "in addition , @xcite present an analysis of the same data based on voigt profile decompositions .",
    "we are very grateful to milan bogosavljevi , alice shapley , dawn erb , naveen reddy , max pettini , ryan trainor , and david law for their invaluable contributions to the keck baryonic structure survey , without which the results presented here would not have been possible .",
    "we also thank ryan cooke for his help with the continuum fitting of qso spectra , and we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript , and for valuable suggestions .",
    "this work was supported by an nwo vidi grant ( or , js ) , by the us national science foundation through grants ast-0606912 and ast-0908805 , and by the david and lucile packard foundation ( ccs ) .",
    "ccs acknowledges additional support from the john d. and catherine t. macarthur foundation and the peter and patricia gruber foundation .",
    "we thank the w.  m.  keck observatory staff for their assistance with the observations.we also thank the hawaiian people , as without their hospitality the observations presented here would not have been possible .",
    "as discussed in section  [ redshifts ] , there are random errors in the redshift measurements of @xmath92 for those obtained from lris spectra , and @xmath471 for the nirspec subsample .",
    "we expect that adding errors that are small compared to the redshift errors that are already present in the data will have very little effect , whereas adding errors that are large compared to the actual redshift errors should strongly degrade the signal .",
    "figure  [ losverror ] illustrates what effect the addition of random , gaussian redshift errors has .",
    "the left and right panels show median optical depth profiles in cuts along the @xmath142- and @xmath276-axes of figure  [ 2ddifferentiallog ] corresponding to the nearest los and transverse bins , respectively .",
    "the data points in the left ( right ) panel are thus identical to the red circles ( black squares ) of the first panel of figure  [ 2dcuts ] .",
    "the blue , green , red , and orange curves show the results after adding redshift errors with @xmath472 , 110 , 165 , and 495 @xmath473 , respectively .",
    "this is done by adding a random error from a given gaussian distribution to each galaxy redshift .",
    "redshift errors smear out the signal along the los direction , thereby strongly reducing its amplitude . adding 55 @xmath473 errors hardly changes anything , but for 110 and 165 @xmath473 significant differences start to appear .",
    "errors of 495 @xmath473 completely wash out the signal .",
    "we conclude that the true redshift errors are @xmath474 .",
    "because a single galaxy contributes pixels to multiple distance bins along the los , we expect the errors to be correlated in the los direction .",
    "conversely , since a single galaxy only has one impact parameter , we expect the errors to be uncorrelated in the direction transverse to the los . in this section",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case and that the errors along the los are correlated over scales of @xmath475 .",
    "to study the correlation between points , we made 1,000 bootstrap realizations of our galaxy sample , found the median @xmath140 in each of the distance bins for each of the realizations , and then computed the spearman rank correlation coefficient between different distance bins .",
    "in other words , if we created a scatter plot of the median optical depth in bins @xmath476 and @xmath269 where each point is a bootstrap realization , then a high rank correlation would show up as points clustered along a line , whereas a correlation coefficient of zero would correspond to a random cloud of points in @xmath477 space .",
    "we use rank correlation tests instead of the covariance matrix because some of the pixels are set to very high optical depths due to saturation , or to very low optical depths because they have an apparent positive flux ( see section  [ pod ] ) . by using a non - parametric measure of the correlation strength",
    ", we are not susceptible to such problems ( we use medians rather than averages for the same reason ) .",
    "the red circles in the left panel of figure  [ errorcorrelation2d ] shows the median optical depth for los separations @xmath478",
    "( i.e.  0.36  0.50  pmpc for pure hubble flow ) as a function of transverse distance .",
    "similarly , the black squares in the right panel show the median optical depth for transverse distances 0.36  0.50  pmpc as a function of los separation .",
    "these points are thus identical to those shown in the central panel of figure  [ 2dcuts ] .",
    "the rest of the colored curves in figure  [ errorcorrelation2d ] show the rank correlation coefficient between different points , with the corresponding scale indicated on the right @xmath276-axis .",
    "values of the correlation coefficient from 0.5 to 1 imply a strong correlation , between 0.2 and 0.5 a weak correlation , values around 0 imply there is no correlation , and negative values imply that there is an anti - correlation .",
    "for example , in the left panel the top red curve shows the correlation between the 4th point and all the ones that lie at larger distances .",
    "the rank correlation coefficient for the 4th point with itself is 1 , but the correlation with the subsequent points is about zero .",
    "this confirms that the points are uncorrelated in the transverse direction .    on the other hand",
    ", the right panel shows that the points are strongly correlated for los separations @xmath479 and become uncorrelated for distances @xmath480 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we observe no evidence for structure along the los for separations @xmath481 ( see figs .  [ 2ddifferentialfixed ] and [ 2dcuts ] ) .",
    "finally , figure  [ errorcorrelation_log ] shows the extent of the correlation between the errors of different points when we bin in terms of the 3-d hubble distance .",
    "as the 3-d hubble distance combines uncorrelated transverse with correlated los separations , the result must be intermediate between that for the two directions .",
    "figure  [ errorcorrelation_log ] demonstrates that this is indeed the case .",
    "adjacent points are weakly correlated , while more distant points are essentially uncorrelated .",

    "<S> we study the interface between galaxies and the intergalactic medium by measuring the absorption by neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of 679 rest - frame - uv selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that have impact parameters @xmath1 ( proper ) mpc to the line of sight of one of 15 bright , background qsos and that fall within the redshift range of its ly@xmath2  forest . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first 2-d maps of the absorption around galaxies , plotting the median ly@xmath2  pixel optical depth as a function of transverse and line of sight separation from galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the ly@xmath2  optical depths are measured using an automatic algorithm that takes advantage of all available lyman series lines . </S>",
    "<S> the median optical depth , and hence the median density of atomic hydrogen , drops by more than an order of magnitude around 100 kpc , which is similar to the virial radius of the halos thought to host the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the median remains enhanced , at the @xmath3 level , out to at least 2.8 mpc ( i.e.  @xmath4 comoving mpc ) , but the scatter at a given distance is large compared with the median excess optical depth , suggesting that the gas is clumpy . within 100 ( 200 ) kpc , and over @xmath5 , the covering fraction of gas with ly@xmath2  optical depth greater than unity is @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> absorbers with @xmath8 are typically closer to galaxies than random </S>",
    "<S> . the mean galaxy overdensity around absorbers increases with the optical depth and also as the length scale over which the galaxy overdensity is evaluated is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> absorbers with @xmath9 reside in regions where the galaxy number density is close to the cosmic mean on scales @xmath10 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly detect two types of redshift space anisotropies . on scales </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 , or @xmath12 mpc , the absorption is stronger along the line of sight than in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> this `` finger of god '' effect may be due to redshift errors , but is probably dominated by gas motions within or very close to the halos . on the other hand , on scales of 1.4 - 2.0 mpc </S>",
    "<S> the absorption is compressed along the line of sight ( with @xmath3 significance ) , an effect that we attribute to large - scale infall ( i.e.  the kaiser effect ) . </S>"
