    "we make a more detailed study , both analytical and numerical , of some _ exact relativistic _",
    "solutions we recently proposed to describe static , axially symmetric massive core - shell systems ( vieira and letelier 1996a , 1997 , hereafter vl1 and vl2 , respectively ) .",
    "we add in this way to the efforts of modeling many situations of interest in astrophysics involving massive shell - like structures around centers , as for example black holes or neutron stars surrounded by massive shell and ring remnants .",
    "a nice illustration of this possibility is offered by the famous supernova 1987a plus its physical rings , see e.  g.  panagia et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , meyer ( 1997 ) and chevalier ( 1997 ) . at least in a seminal sense",
    ", the model could also describe galaxies since there are many of them exhibiting massive rings ( sackett and sparke 1990 , arnaboldi et al .",
    "1993 , reshetnikov and sotnikova 1997 ) and shells ( malin and carter 1983 , quinn 1984 , dupraz and combes 1987 , barnes and hernquist 1992 ) , while many others possibly have galactic nuclei hiding black holes ( see kormendy and richstone 1995 for a review ) .",
    "specifically , we implement here a monopolar core ( a black hole in the relativistic case ) plus an exterior shell of dipoles , quadrupoles and octopoles .",
    "obviously , these multipoles are shell - like legendre expansions i.  e.  their corresponding terms increase with the distance in the intermediate vacuum between the core and the shell . beyond its own applicability",
    ", the model also points to the possibility of a realistic description of any axially symmetric relativistic core - shell configuration whose approximation as a static system should be valid at some useful time scale , via a systematic multipolar legendre expansion .",
    "in fact , a further step in this program was lastly started in letelier and vieira ( 1997 ) by giving stationarity ( rotation ) to the relativistic case of a monopolar core plus a purely dipolar shell .",
    "this is an important improvement since real celestial objects do rotate .",
    "the present analysis will be extended to rotating core - shell models in a forthcoming contribution .    additionally , we consider the newtonian counterpart of the relativistic model above , which was only sketched in the previous works , and show that they could describe core - shell systems `` per se '' interesting in astronomy .",
    "so , we can have massive circumstellar dust shells around certain types of stars as byproducts of their death , see e.  g.  barlow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for an example of ( irregular ) circumstelar shells around luminous blue variables and a review by groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) about dust shells around carbon mira variables .",
    "another potential application for core - shell models is to the more speculative possibility of hollow galactic halos of dark matter made of neutrinos recently considered by ralston and smith ( 1991 ) , madsen ( 1991 ) and barnes ( 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , we will see that the study of the relativistic core - shell model in parallel to its newtonian counterpart is useful also to clarify the physical content of the former one .",
    "after poincar ( 1957 ) and the kam theory ( after kolmogorov 1954 , arnold 1963a , 1963b and moser 1967 ) it became well established that non - integrability and hence chaos is a general rather than exceptional manifestation in the context of dynamical systems ( modeling or not physical situations ) ( see berry 1977 ) . given this ubiquitous fact , an important issue in astronomical modeling is to study in which extent in phase space chaoticity rises in models that are relevant to describe real systems and what are its consequences .",
    "for example , binney ( 1982a ) discusses the difficulties of constructing stationary self - consistent models when a significant fraction of orbits are irregular since they may not obey neither vlasov s nor jean s equations .",
    "then , it is remarkable that a wide class of fully integrable potentials , the so called stckel potentials ( lynden - bell 1962 , de zeeuw 1985 and de zeeuw et al .",
    "1986 ) , are feasible starting points to describe , by themselves or by adding perturbations , real disc , elliptical or even triaxial galaxies . for more realistic tridimensional models",
    "there are evidences for rounder and smoother mass distributions generating only relatively small fractions of chaotic orbits ( schwarzschild 1979 , binney and tremaine 1987 and evans et al .",
    "1997 ) , while flattening and/or sharpening of the mass distributions , for example through increasing triaxiality and/or putting cusps and central masses to mimic black holes , tends to increase the chaoticity and force us to take it into account ( gerhard and binney 1985 , schwarzschild 1993 , merrit and fridman 1996 , norman et al .",
    "1996 , merrit 1997 and valluri and merrit 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the emergence of chaos in two - dimensional models has more loose correlations with morphological aspects , see for example binney and spergel ( 1982 ) , richstone ( 1982 ) , binney ( 1982b ) , gerhard ( 1985 ) and sridhar and touma ( 1997 ) .",
    "we address in this work also a numerical study about the chaoticity of orbits trapped in the bound gravitational zones between the core and the external massive shell . beyond its own applicability",
    "as seen above , we take advantage of models that are generic within the class of axially symmetric core - shell distributions and moreover offer exact relativistic and newtonian counterparts to be compared , in order to achieve some understanding about chaoticity related to two aspects : firstly , to the role of reflection symmetries shared by almost all models in astronomy and astrophysics , and secondly to the consequences of treating exact central black holes as just newtonian central masses .    in the first part of this article ( section [ analitico ] ) we present analytical results concerning some properties like unicity and analyticity of the relativistic solutions themselves , in connection with both the linearized core - shell solutions and the corresponding newtonian models taken as limiting cases .    in section [ sol ]",
    "we enlarge the relativistic solution presented in vl1 for a monopolar core plus a shell of quadrupoles and octopoles in order to include a dipolar shell component .",
    "this complete solution was only outlined in vl2 . in this later reference",
    "it was emphasized that the case of a core plus purely dipolar shell is physically non - trivial already in the newtonian gravity , moreover , it was shown that the newtonian dipolar case is integrable , in contrast with its chaotic relativistic counterpart , which allowed us to characterize the chaotic behavior in this case as an intrinsic general relativistic effect .",
    "here , we take advantage of this striking difference of the dipolar case in order to reinforce the numerical conclusions presented in section [ caos ] concerning the non - trivial dynamical role played by the presence / absence of the _ discrete _ reflection symmetry about the equatorial plane on the chaoticity of the orbits .    in section [ reg ]",
    "we proceed to a full elimination of axial ( conical ) singularities ( hereafter css ) from the relativistic model , which was only partially accomplished in vl1 .",
    "in fact , css are not globally removable from neither static nor stationary many - body relativistic solutions since they are self - consistently demanded by einstein s equations to strut the otherwise unstable configuration against its own gravity ( see robertson and noonan 1968 and letelier and oliveira 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "so , in the present case the most we can do is really move all them outside the shell , thus obtaining a true vacuum in the intermediate space between the core and the shell .",
    "we also discuss in this section the conditions for the kruskal - type analyticity of the solutions at the horizon of the central black hole and use both aspects to find the conditions under which the unicity of the models is assured .    in section [ rw ]",
    "we present the linearization of the relativistic model in the multipole strengths via the so called regge - wheeler ( rw ) formalism .",
    "in particular , we see that our model exemplifies the fact that css survive to the linearization process , their presence in the intermediate vacuum being in fact an obstruction to the application of the rw formalism .",
    "this does reinforce the interpretation of css as a kind of singular matter distribution necessary to the dynamical consistency of static and stationary relativistic models . however being intrinsecally relativistic manifestations , an adiabatic treatment of css in the newtonian limit allows for estimates concerning the emission rate of gravitational waves by two coalescing rotating black holes ( araujo et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in section",
    "[ new ] we discuss newtonian core - shell models , on their own as well as limiting cases of the corresponding relativistic ones .",
    "we put the hnon - heiles - like structure of the relativistic models in the appropriate astronomical context and stress the physical content of the various terms present in them , in particular we see that the apparently naive constant relativistic solution does in fact hide a relativistic homoeoid ( see chandrasekhar 1987 for newtonian homoeoids ) .",
    "the numerical part of this article is presented in section [ caos ] and deals with a study of the chaoticity of orbits trapped in the intermediate vacuum between the core and the shell .",
    "specifically , we shall explore in this section the fact that , due to its generality , axially symmetric core - shell expansions are particularly suitable to study the dynamical role played by a discrete symmetry of the model  namely the reflection symmetry about an equatorial plane , on the chaoticity of orbits .",
    "the reflection symmetry is present in the model if and only if the shell is of even - type , i.  e.  _ iff _ @xmath1-poles , @xmath2 , occur in the shell expansion , and it is broken if we add any odd , @xmath3-poles to the expansion .",
    "the hypothesis of reflection symmetry is a widely spread assumption in astronomical modeling and its twofold justification lies firstly in that too many real celestial objects to be modeled , for example stars themselves , star clusters and galaxies seem in fact very symmetric with respect to a middle plane .",
    "another reason for this symmetry assumption is that the resulting model gets strongly simplified in both analytical and numerical aspects . of course",
    ", we do not expect the reflection symmetry be realized in nature exactly , so it is relevant to search for possible detectable dynamical effects arising from deviations of that symmetry .",
    "a strong additional motivation for this numerical study is to compare from the point of view of the chaotic behavior what happens when the presence of true central black holes are simplified by reducing them to newtonian central masses .",
    "this is a commom practice in current modeling , as for example in gerhard and binney ( 1985 ) , sridhar and touma ( 1997 ) and valluri and merrit ( 1998 ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , the numerical findings show marked effects on the chaoticity of the orbits in the intermediate vacuum between the core and the shell linked to the presence / lack of the reflection symmetry in the relativistic as well as newtonian models .",
    "we also find strong quantitative differences in the chaoticity manifested in both relativistic and newtonian cases .    finally , we present the conclusions with some discussion and prospects in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we deal here with static , axially symmetric models , for which the weyl coordinates @xmath4 are the starting point : @xmath5 -e^{-2\\nu}\\rho^2d\\phi^2,\\label{hh1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 only . except where units are explicitly required ( particularly in section [ new ] ) , we use non - dimensional variables : @xmath10 ( idem for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the light velocity in vacuum and @xmath13 is some convenient unit of length .",
    "einstein s equations in absence of matter ( vacuum ) reduce in this case to the usual laplace equation for @xmath6 @xmath14 and the quadrature @xmath15\\;d\\rho+ 2\\rho\\nu_{,\\rho}\\nu_{,z}\\;dz\\label{hh3}\\ ] ] for @xmath7 .    before proceeding ,",
    "we mention that the weyl coordinates should be considered somewhat deceiving if we insist in naively transferring their image contents about mass configurations to the newtonian common sense .",
    "for example , the spherical shape of the horizon of a black hole is compressed into a bar in weyl s coordinates , the interior portion of the black hole space - time being wholly discarded from the portrait .",
    "apart from the well known fact that the relativistic context is not cast in a straight relation with the newtonian one in strong regimes , they are mathematically sound as will be clear later when we will compare both versions of the core - shell models .",
    "we pass to the prolate spheroidal coordinates @xmath16 , which have a direct link with the `` spherical '' ones @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) we will use later , @xmath19 { \\mbox{,\\hspace{0.4cm}$u \\geq 1,$}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & v = cos\\theta=\\frac{1}{2}[\\sqrt{\\rho^2+(z+1)^2}- \\sqrt{\\rho^2+(z-1)^2 } ] { \\mbox{,\\hspace{0.4cm}$-1\\leq v\\leq 1$}},\\label{hh4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , in terms of @xmath20 , @xmath21 eqs .",

    "we are interested here in monopolar core plus shell - type models , so we are guided by the newtonian case ( to be detailed in section [ new ] ) to the specific solution of the form ( up to third order ) @xmath29 @xmath30 is an integration constant and @xmath31 describes the monopolar core , which either reduces to a black hole if we put @xmath32 and identify @xmath33 with the schwarzschild radius of the core ( in which case @xmath17 above are schwarzschild s coordinates ) , or can be switched off by simply putting @xmath34 .",
    "the remaining terms correspond to the multipoles originated from the exterior shell of matter : dipole @xmath35 , quadrupole @xmath36 and octopole @xmath37 ( note the opposite sign convention for dipoles in this definition with respect to that appearing in vl2 ) .",
    "the nontrivial character of shell dipoles in both newtonian and general relativistic theories of gravity has been anticipated in vl2 while shells made of quadrupoles plus octopoles were considered in vl1 .",
    "if non - monopolar cores should be considered , we should add to ( [ hh7 ] ) terms of the form @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "much more sophisticated multipolar relativistic treatments for core , shell and core - shell models are considered by thorne ( 1980 ) , zhang ( 1986 ) and suen ( 1986a , 1986b ) , respectively , in terms of higher order systematic expansions of the metric in de donder coordinates .",

    "there is another class of singularities that do not show up in a simple way in the curvature , the so called conical singularities ( css ) ( sokolov and starobinskii 1977 ) .",
    "these singularities are in some sense like the distributions related to a low dimensional newtonian potential , e.g. , for an infinite massive wire the potential is @xmath56 , we have that the laplace equation , the analog to the curvature , gives us @xmath57 for @xmath58 while for @xmath59 we need to use some global property , for example gauss theorem , to get @xmath60 . to be more precise ,",

    "the ratio between the arc of the circumference and its radius is @xmath68 in this case .",

    ", we can pick up the curvature singularity as being of the form @xmath71 .",
    "it is well known that css arise when we consider weyl s solutions near the symmetry axis ( robertson and noonan 1968 and letelier and oliveira 1998a ) .",
    "they are interpreted as a geometric consequence of the presence of some kind of `` strut '' , necessary to consistently prevent any static non - spherically symmetric model from collapsing due to self - gravity . in this sense , the uniqueness of the core - type , one - body solution for the ( static ) spherically symmetric einstein s equations ( namely , the schwarzschild one ) should relate to the fact that it is impossible to attach struts in a perfectly round metric .",
    "for the weyl solutions , we can always consider a small disk centered in the symmetry axis ( @xmath72 ) and impose that the ratio between the circumference and its radius equals @xmath73 .",
    "this is the condition to eliminate css from the intermediate vacuum ( then attaching them to the infinity ) , which amounts to impose on the function @xmath7 the well known conditions of elementary flatness @xmath74 these two conditions fix the constant @xmath43 and impose an additional constraint on the _ odd _ shell multipoles ( @xmath35 and @xmath37 here ) in the presence of the black hole : @xmath75 @xmath76=0.\\label{hh11a}\\ ] ] the condition ( [ hh11 ] ) fixing @xmath43 is necessary in all cases to rule out the conical singularities . from ( [ hh11a ] ) we see that the former is also a sufficient condition in two cases : i ) the shell of dust is left alone by switching off the core ( @xmath77 ) , and ii ) in the presence of the black hole ( @xmath78 ) , the shell is made only of even - type multipoles ( @xmath36 here ) .",
    "we also see that it is possible to eliminate conical singularities for a single or pure shell component only if it is of the even type .",

    "it is worth to emphasize that assuring analyticity to the metric at the horizon has nothing to do with removing neither strong nor conical singularities from curvature invariants , since the vacuum between the core and the shell are free from strong singularities while the conical ones are removable from there through conditions ( [ hh11 ] ) and ( [ hh11a ] ) above .",
    "secondly , however kruskal coordinates are historically linked to the question of geodesic completness , this issue is not necessary to our purposes .",

    "relations ( [ hh19 ] ) and ( [ hh19a ] ) show that analyticity near the horizon is a nontrivial property of the relativistic shells , having to be forced into the solution to assure its analytic behavior there .",

    "we can simplify these matrices further by exploring the freedom to make arbitrary , first order in @xmath117 , coordinate transformations around @xmath144 .",
    "in particular , the matrices achieve its most simple or canonical forms in the so called regge - wheeler infinitesimal gauge ( regge and wheeler 1957 ) .",

    "s equations , this means that there correspond to them a certain energy - momentum tensor with this same structure ( it does not matter here how exotic they should be ) and hence we does not have a true vacuum between the core and the shell , as it is supposed from the starting in the rw formalism . by comparing ( [ hh31 ] ) with the conditions ( [ hh11 ] ) plus ( [ hh11a ] ) with @xmath32 for schwarzschild s metric , we see that the former amounts to rule out the conical singularities from the linear approximation .",
    "in other words , conical singularities _ survive _ to the linearization and their presence is an obstruction to the application of the rw formalism .",
    "so , what is some surprising in all this is that conical singularities strutting the model against its own gravity persist after the linearization , contrary to the loosely accepted idea that they should lie in the very non - linear realm of general relativity .",

    "the question is : for which newtonian shells are these constraints on the constants @xmath182 attainable ? to exemplify ,",

    "homoeoids are thus gravitationally undetectable from inside .",
    "this shows that the constant solution above is a struted , relativistic version of a newtonian homoeoid .",
    "if in addition we remove the conical singularity from inside the relativistic homoeoid by letting @xmath196 ( remember that conical singularities are not globally removable in static relativistic shell solutions since they are indispensable to strut the shell against its own gravity , so @xmath196 really moves them outside the shell ) , we see that a simple rescaling of the time and the radial coordinate reduces the metric inside the homoeoid to that of minkowski . on the other hand , the condition ( [ hh19 ] ) with @xmath197 shows that if we add a black hole inside an homoeoid then the metric does not extend analytically through the black hole horizon _ unless _ we maintain the `` strut '' in place with strength @xmath198 .",
    "this is a non - intuitive aspect of the ( relativistic ) composition of a black hole with the rather simple homoeoidal shell .",
    "an easy point that is worth to emphasize concerning the interpretation of multipolar expansions of core and shell types is the following : core multipoles measure deviations from _ sphericity _ of central mass distributions , while shell multipoles measure how much shells deviate from _ homoeoids _ , the later being a rather large class of distributions in which homogeneous spherical shells are very particular members .",
    "we close this section with a brief discussion about the hnon - heiles structure of the present newtonian limit .",
    "it was already pointed out in vl1 that the potential of the shell alone pertains to the hnon - heiles family of potentials , yet it does not suffice from its own to confine orbits in the intermediate vacuum ( see the opposite signs of @xmath199 and @xmath9 in the quadrupole term of ( [ hh22 ] ) ) .",
    "though in practice we need to consider the full potential of a given galactic model viz .",
    "its effective potential @xmath200 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath99 of a test particle with mass @xmath201 is given in this case by @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the conserved angular momentum of the particle associated to the axial symmetry of the galaxy ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "it is also usual to assume that galaxies have further a reflection symmetry about an equatorial plane , in which case the motion restricted to that plane is integrable , in particular having a central stable circular orbit at some fixed radius , say , @xmath204 . to study a nonplanar stelar orbit as a small deviation from the planar one",
    ", we perform a series expansion of @xmath200 in the variables @xmath205 , thus approximating the full motion by a bi - dimensional harmonic oscillator perturbed by higher order terms .",
    "this is the very astronomical origin ( after truncating the series and idealizing the numeric coefficients ) of the cubic hnon - heiles polynomial , now a paradigm of non - integrable potential .",
    "some history about this potential in astronomy can be traced , for example , from contopoulos ( 1960 ) , barbanis ( 1962 ) , van de hulst ( 1962 ) , ollongren ( 1962 ) and hnon and heiles ( 1964 ) .    by adding the other terms to the terms originated from the shell expansion to form @xmath200 , we are able to confine test motions in the intermediate vacuum around the central stable orbit .",
    "if the galaxy does not have reflection symmetry around a middle plane ( @xmath206 in the newtonian case and @xmath207 in the relativistic one ) , planar central stable orbits are not possible , there remaining only stable orbits of distorted , nonplanar type .",
    "we will return in section [ caos ] to the discussion of the implications for orbit regularity of the largely assumed hypothesis of reflection symmetry about middle plones in galaxy modeling .",
    "we study the chaoticity of orbits in the intermediate vacuum of newtonian static axially symmetric core - shell models and then compare them to the geodesics of the corresponding relativistic cases .",
    "it is amazing that this class of models has relativistic and newtonian counterparts to be compared , there existing moreover sound observational motivations for both .",
    "specifically , we analyse in both cases the role played by a _ discrete _ symmetry , namely the reflection symmetry around the equatorial plane , in regularizing orbits against chaoticity .",
    "the hypothesis of reflection symmetry is a widely spread assumption in astronomical modeling and its twofold justification lies firstly in that too many real objects to be modeled seem in fact nearly symmetric with respect to a plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the models are simplified in both analytical and numerical aspects by that assumption . of course",
    ", we do not expect that symmetry be realized in nature exactly so it is relevant to search for possible orbital effects of its breaking .",
    "it is important to realize that all cases treated here preserve the axial symmetry  the next continuous symmetry after the missing spherical one , which allows us to isolate the dynamical effects of only breaking or preserving the reflection symmetry itself .",
    "another advantage of the present study is that it is model independent ( of course within the class of models we are dealing with ) as we are focusing on general multipolar shell expansions instead on specific mass distributions .",

    "so , the remaining differences between the relativistic figure 5(e ) and the newtonian one 4(b ) are due to the following : the central region ( in the surface of section ) is the only one able to become chaotic in the newtonian case since its orbits are just those ( non - planar ones ) that can reach the unstable regions near the two unstable scape points symmetrically placed outside the equatorial plane , while the more external ( in the surface of section ) quasi - equatorial orbits are regular since they are far from those two points and under the strong influence of the equatorial stable orbit in the boundary of the surface of section .",

    "5(f ) shows the restoration of a robust set of regular asymmetric orbits around a primary stable one when we break the reflection symmetry around the equatorial plane by switching on the odd multipoles onto the prolate rq - cases , much the same as occured in the prolate newtonian q - cases .",
    "in the first part of this article we presented an unifying discussion concerning with the properties and , more important , the physical content of some relativistic , static , axially symmetric core - shell models on their own as well as in connection with the corresponding linearized and newtonian models taken as limiting cases . the analytical and observational motivations for these relativistic and newtonian models were also shown .",
    "this was acomplished in a reasonably self - contained manner in the introduction and section 2 and needs no additional comments .    in the second , numerical part of this work we explored the fact that the models i ) are generic within the class they pertain and ii ) have exact relativistic and newtonian counterparts to be compared , to study the chaoticity of bound orbits in the vacuum between the core and the shell .",
    "specificaly , we firstly tested the relevance of the presence / absence of the reflection symmetry around the equatorial plane for the chaotic behavior of the orbits .",
    "we find consistent evidences for a non - trivial role played by the reflection symmetry on the chaoticity of the dynamics in both the relativistic and newtonian cases .",
    "we summarize these findings as follows : the _ breakdown _ of the reflection symmetry about the equatorial plane in both newtonian and relativistic core - shell models does i ) _ enhance _ in a significant way the chaoticity of orbits in reflection symmetric _ oblate _ shell models and ii ) _ inhibit _ significantly also the occurrence of chaos in reflection symmetric _ prolate _ shell models .",
    "in particular , the lack of the reflection symmetry provides the phase space in the prolate case with a robust family of regular orbits around a stable periodic orbit that is otherwise missing at higher energies .",
    "the other point we addressed about the chaotic behavior of orbits was for the consequences of substituting true central black holes by newtonian central masses .",
    "we find that the relative extents of the chaotic regions in the relativistic cases are significantly larger than in the corresponding newtonian ones .",
    "although not surprising in thesis , the strong differences between both regimes are in order in view of the procedure found in the literature of simulating the presence of a black hole at the core of a galaxy with a naive @xmath0 newtonian term ( see for example gerhard and binney 1985 , sridhar and touma 1997 and valluri and merrit 1998 ) .",
    "this approximation is certainly valid far from the black hole but not in its proximity as is the case here .",
    "these findings stress i ) the non - trivial role of the reflection simmetry in both relativistic and newtonian regimes , in contrast with its universal acceptance in astronomical modeling , ii ) the strong qualitative and quantitative differences between relativistic and newtonian regimes , in particular when dealing with orbits in the vicinity of black holes , and iii ) the intrincate interplay between both aspects when they are simultaneously present .    the true dynamical aspect related to the role of reflection symmetries on the regularity of the orbits refers of course to the parity of the constants of motion ( the famous third one in the present axially symmetric case ) with respect to the coordinates , as well as their power to regularize orbits in phase space . translated to these terms",
    ", the findings above are saying that the additional constant of motion in question is by far more powerful whenever i ) it is an _ even _ function of the coordinates for _ oblate _ cases , or ii ) it is an _",
    "odd _ function of the coordinates for _ prolate _ cases .",
    "since the issue of finding global or even approximate constants of motion given the dynamics is hard if not feasible in most cases , the former procedure of simply checking the presence / absence of reflection symmetries is of much more practical interest .",
    "additional study is needed to see if and how our findings are extendible to more realistic configurations , with and without black holes / central masses .",
    "the obvious improvement is to fill the intermediate vacuum with some reasonable mass distribution . while this is far from obvious in general relativity , it is easy to do in the newtonian context .",
    "for example , we are considering just superpose our shell multipoles to some relevant potentials of celestial mechanics such as plummer - kuzmin , ferrers and others and even triaxial potentials .",
    "they have one or more planes of symmetry , with or without axial symmetry , and so we can perturb them with shell terms to verify similar effects to those we found .    here",
    "we considered only tube orbits ( @xmath241 ) since we are interested in the effects of the existence of planes of symmetry on _ tridimensional _ motion ( somewhat similar effects to the found here are seen in gerhard 1985 for the restricted case of planar motions with respect to the existence of one or more lines of symmetry ) .",
    "the model improvements above will allow us to study the effects of breaking the reflection symmetry also on tridimensional box orbits .",
    "meantime , the fully relativistic program is in progress .",
    "we have recently succeeded in giving rotation to a black hole ( i.  e.  in converting it into a kerr black hole ) plus a dipolar shell term ( letelier and vieira 1997 ) .",
    "there are increasing evidences for the existence of black holes , particularly inside active galactic nuclei ( kormendy and richstone 1995 ) , which motivate us to consider also rotating core - shell models in the same lines followed here ."
