    "electron transport in nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) , such as suspended nano - beams , cantilevers , and nano - oscillators , is now attracting considerable attention @xcite . in shuttles",
    ", electrons can be carried by a single nano - particle or single molecule , which oscillates between two leads .",
    "this mechanical motion strongly modifies the lead - shuttle tunneling matrix elements , affecting the charge transfer .",
    "theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of nanooscillators clearly demonstrated the influence of mechanical motion on their electrical properties .",
    "previously , electron transport through a moving island was examined in the strong coulomb - blockade regime , when the conducting level of the nano - oscillator can only be _ single _ populated , with higher - energy states being energetically inaccessible . here",
    ", we demonstrate that a _ charged _ island behaves differently from an uncharged one ; correspondingly , the possible _",
    "double _ occupation of the conducting level leads to a situation where the coulomb blockade peaks , associated with the first and second electrons transferred through the island , have _ different _ dependencies on the nano - oscillator parameters .",
    "moreover , we show that the double occupation leads to a _ conductance enhancement _ for the second electron entering the island . to achieve that",
    ", we apply a previously - developed approach @xcite which makes it possible to examine the case of finite on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the moving island studied in this work can be considered as a _ shuttle _ because of its actual function : shuttling .",
    "when the island moves closer to the left lead , increasing that matrix element , it loads an electron .",
    "then , the island moves closer to the right lead and unloads the electron .",
    "therefore , this describes the operation of an electron shuttle .",
    "we have opted to use the term `` mobile island '' for this `` electron shuttle '' because in the nanomechanical community oscillators exhibiting an instability are called `` shuttles '' .",
    "still , functionally , the moving island described here is effectively a shuttle .",
    "usually , a nano - oscillator is considered to be placed symmetrically between the leads .",
    "however , recently several works discussed the situation when there is an asymmetry in the lead - oscillator coupling produced either by the difference in the tunnel matrix elements @xcite or by the spatial shift of the equilibrium oscillator position @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", it was theoretically proposed that , if the island is closer to one lead than to the other , the current through the structure depends _ exponentially _ on this spatial shift ( with the tunnelling length @xmath0 ) , because the overlap integral of the electron wave functions in the island and in the leads , involved in the tunnel matrix elements , exponentially decreases with distance . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , this small displacement , shifting the island close to one of the leads , was produced by the large magnetic field gradient acting on the spin of the nitrogen or phosphorus impurity incorporated into their model of a @xmath1 shuttle .",
    "here we show that such displacement can be achieved _ naturally _ in the island without impurities with an excess electron in an electric field produced by the source - drain voltage or an external capacitor ( see fig .  1 )",
    ". moreover , this kind of spatial asymmetry can be associated with the jahn - teller effect : when an orbital state of an ion is degenerate for symmetry reasons , the ligands will experience forces driving the system to a lower - symmetry configuration , lowering its energy .",
    "consequently , the ligand position between the two ions is _ not symmetric _ and changes with the electron transfer from one ion to the other .",
    "_ oscillations _ of such ligands , either as oxygen atoms in manganites @xcite or rare - earth atoms in filled skutterudites @xcite , were analyzed jointly with the jahn - teller effect .",
    "however , the tunnelling length was assumed to be _ infinite _ in refs .",
    "@xcite and the dependence of the tunnel matrix elements on the oscillator position was _ not _ taken into account . here",
    "we consider these effects and find a remarkably rich behavior of the conductance of nano - oscillators , if the matrix elements have an asymmetry as in refs .",

    "the conclusions of this work are presented in sec .",
    "to examine electron transport through a moving island , we assume that the island has a single spatial state which can be populated by two electrons having opposing spin projections , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with _",
    "finite _ on - site coulomb interaction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "it should be noted that here we consider the situation where the coupling of the nano - oscillator to the leads is weak , so the kondo - like correlations are not important .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given by ( @xmath5 for left , right ; @xmath6 for spin up , down ; @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the electrons in the island and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators with wavevector @xmath13 in the @xmath14-lead . the tunneling term , @xmath15 has tunneling amplitudes depending explicitly on the position @xmath16 of the island as @xmath17 with the tunneling lengths @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the left and right leads , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the nanomechanical oscillator also contains the interaction between the charge stored in the oscillator and an effective electric field @xmath20 , as @xmath21 this field @xmath22 can be produced by the voltage applied to the leads , by the jahn - teller effect , or even by an independently controlled electric field , if the structure is placed inside an external capacitor . here",

    "accordingly , the tunneling term has a form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fermi operator given by @xmath38 with the first term responsible for the electron tunneling from the unoccupied island and the second one describing the electron transfer through the double - populated level . here , @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the eigenstates of the mechanical oscillator hamiltonian , and",

    "it is evident that the frank - condon factors are different for the first and second electrons entering the island because the center of the oscillations is shifted in the case of the charged island ( see fig .",
    "it should be emphasized that by introducing the operators @xmath37 we are able to derive the equations of motion _ analytically _ , without the use of the hartree - fock approximation , assuming only a _ weak _ lead - island tunnelling coupling . from a general point of view , the method presented here is equivalent to the master equation approach .",

( 29 ) , as well as the second cumulant , @xmath80 in fig .  2 as functions of the separation between the energy of the island level @xmath81 and the equilibrium chemical potential @xmath82 of the leads .",
    "the following set of parameters , associated with @xmath1 , was chosen @xcite : the charging energy , @xmath83  mev , the fundamental frequency , @xmath84  mev , and the fundamental uncertainty of the oscillator position @xmath85 the magnetic field is taken to be zero ( so @xmath86 ) , @xmath87  k , @xmath88  mev , and @xmath89  pm .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "2 that when the electron energy level on the island becomes smaller than @xmath82 ( modulo thermal broadening ) , the island is single - populated and , when the energy separation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 is larger than the charging energy , the island is double - populated , as expected .",
    "it should be emphasized that although the _ ensemble averaged _ values of both electron populations are nonzero in the case of single occupation , the population correlator is zero , meaning that the electron having only one of the spin projections can be found in the specific sample .",
    "this pauli repulsion also manifests itself in the negative value of the cumulant @xmath90 in the single - occupation regime .",
    "it should be also noted that the functional dependencies of fig .  2 do _ not _ depend on the value of @xmath91 and the asymmetry of the couplings to the left and right leads .",
    "the current flow of electrons having @xmath2-projection of the spin from the @xmath14-lead can be defined as @xmath92 using the same approximations as in the previous section , we obtain @xmath93\\right\\ } \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the associated conductance , @xmath94 is presented in fig .  3 as a function of @xmath95 and @xmath91 , using the same parameters as in fig .",
    "2 with coupling constants @xmath96 = 0.1 mev and @xmath97 = 0.002 mev and temperatures ( a ) @xmath98  k and ( b ) @xmath87  k. the projections of the three - dimensional plots unto both the ",
    "@xmath99 versus @xmath100 \" and  @xmath99 versus @xmath91 \" planes are shown in fig .",
    "one can see from fig .  3 that the magnitudes of the conductance peaks , associated with the first and second electrons entering the island , are only equal to each other for @xmath101 ( conventional coulomb blockade case ) .",
    "moreover , the conductance through the _ charged _ island is _ drastically enhanced _ at positive moderate values of @xmath91 . it should be noted that the electric field - induced shift would not produce a conductance enhancement for the _ immobile _ island because the exponential increase of the tunnel matrix element between the island and one of the leads is compensated by the same exponential decrease of the tunnel matrix element coupling to the other lead .",
    "however , for the _ mobile _ island , these matrix elements are averaged over the island oscillatory motion and the shift is not cancelled out .",
    "this is even more pronounced for the charged island where the center of the oscillations is already shifted by the presence of the first electron .",
    "formally , the account of the oscillatory mechanical motion during the tunneling events becomes possible due to the _ non - markovian _ character of the equation of motion .",
    "the dependence of the conductance peaks on @xmath91 has a gaussian form ( coming from the frank - condon factors ) with the centers shifted to two different positive values of @xmath91 . with increasing temperature ,",
    "the conductance peaks become broader and the shift is increased , as seen in fig .",
    "this shift can be attributed to the phonon - blockade effect discussed in refs .",
    "it should be noted that the bias - voltage independent displacement @xmath91 can be created , for example , by nearby charge impurities , image charges , device geometry , etc . @xcite .",
    "we also examine the temperature dependence of the conductance peak magnitude . for the _",
    "immobile _ island , one can expect either no temperature dependence , in the case of quantum - mechanical tunneling , or thermal - activation dependence , in the case of over - the - barrier hopping transport .",
    "however , deviations from such behaviors were observed both in transport through single molecules @xcite and in the resistivity of manganites @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it was shown that either the mechanical motion of the nanoconductor or coupling to the quantized thermal modes @xcite can lead to exotic types of temperature dependence .",
    "these can be seen in fig .  4 for various values of @xmath0 , at @xmath101 .",
    "it should be noted that the curves are identical for both peaks in this case .",
    "for nonzero @xmath91 , the temperature dependence becomes even more complicated for small @xmath0 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) for the charged and uncharged shuttle , respectively , because of the temperature - induced shift of the peak position ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the functional dependencies at small @xmath0 are very _ different _ for the two conduction peaks , with the peak for the second electron being almost an order of magnitude larger .",
    "the current @xmath102 through the shuttle is extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , because it appears in several exponents of eq .",
    "it is evident from fig .  4 that the smaller @xmath0 is , the larger the conductance of the system becomes",
    "therefore , the quality of the leads plays a more important role in the electrical properties of nano - oscillators than in most standard electronic devices .",
    "in conclusion , we have examined electron transport through a mobile island which can contain one or two electrons .",
    "we have derived the equations of motion for the electron creation / annihilation operators and have been able to evaluate them ( _ without _ using the hartree - fock approximation ) by introducing a complex fermi operator @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( 9 ) . based on this microscopic approach ,",
    "the equations for the island populations and the correlator of the populations have been derived and solved .",
    "they are involved in the expression for the electron current through the structure , also obtained microscopically .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of an external electric field ( produced either by the voltage applied to the system , by the jahn - teller effect in the molecular junctions , or by an external capacitor ) , and an asymmetry in the coupling of the island to the leads , the conductance of the second electron entering the _ charged _ island is greatly enhanced .",
