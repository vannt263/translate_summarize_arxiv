    "molecular heating is due to the radiative excitation from cosmic microwave background followed by collisional de - excitation .",
    "notice that , although the radiative de - excitation is faster than collisional one ( because the excitation have the opposite ordering ) , the full cooling and heating processes must be evaluated .",

    "we have neglected the chemical heating and cooling due to the enthalpy of reactions ( see puy et al .",
    "+ we adopt the standard cosmological model with zero cosmological constant ( einstein - de sitter universe ) .",

    "the adiabatic cooling becomes dominant .",
    "+ in fig [ fig : cooling ] compton heating and thermal molecular function ( in unit of adiabatic cooling ) are compared . the thermal molecular function , which is mainly a molecular heating , dominates the compton heating when @xmath64 .",
    "this fact should be important for the evolution of the matter after this redshift , particularly for the collapse of the first objects .",
    "we assume that , at some time in the past , there were small deviations from homogeneity in our universe . these deviations can grow due to gravitational instability . as long as these inhomogeneities are small",
    ", their evolution can be studied by the classical linear perturbation theory .",
    "once the deviations from the homogeneous universe become large , the linear theory is no more valid .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that regions which are significantly overdense will collapse and eventually form gravitationally bound objects . in these overdense regions , the self - gravity of",
    "the local mass concentration will work against the expansion of the universe ; i.e. this region expands at a progressively slower rate compared to the background universe .",
    "such a slowing down will increase the density contrast between the overdense region and the background universe and , consequently , make the gravitational potential of the local mass concentration more and more dominant .",
    "eventually , such a region will collapse under its own self - gravity and will form a bound system .",
    "the details of the above process will depend on the initial density profile .",
    "the simplest model which one can study analytically is based on the assumption that the overdense region is spherically symmetric .",
    "+ peebles ( 1980 ) described the _ transition _ between the linear regime ( where the expansion of the perturbation is maximum ) and the non - linear regime ( where the perturbation begins to collapse ) by introducing the turn - around point . + in an einstein - de sitter universe , the temperature at the turn - around point ( hereafter turn - around temperature ) is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the temperature of the matter at the redshift of the turn - around @xmath67 .",
    "generally it is assumed an isothermal perturbation described by the initial mass spectrum : @xmath68^\\alpha   \\ , ( 1+z)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the mass of an overdense region ( i.e. the mass of a cloud ) and @xmath70 m@xmath71 is a typical mass of a supercluster .",
    "gott & rees ( 1975 ) take @xmath72 .",
    "thus the redshift of the turn - around is given by : @xmath73^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ] it is crucial to know the temperature of the matter at the turn - around redshift in order to evaluate the thermal initial condition of the collapse .",
    "we consider the same order of magnitude for the mass of the fluctuations given by lahav ( 1986 ) and puy & signore ( 1996 ) which correspond to turn - around redshift in the range : @xmath74 , which is the typical period of the formation of the first objects .",
    "+ the evolution of turn - around temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] without and with the molecular contributions , the evolution of radiation temperature is also plotted .",
    "we see two regimes for the two turn - around temperatures : one corresponds to a temperature higher than the radiation temperature @xmath56 , the second is relative to temperature below @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to estimate the redshift @xmath75 where the turn - around temperature is equal to @xmath56 , this point govern the initial behaviour of the gas : if the turn - around temperature is below the radiation temperature the gas heats , when the gas cools when the radiative temperature is below the turn - around temperature .",
    "thus this condition is located at the redshift @xmath76 in the case without molecules and @xmath77 in the case with molecules .",
    "another interesting point is the point which corresponds to the turn - around redshift @xmath78 .",
    "this redshift corresponds to a typical value 10@xmath79 m@xmath71 of a collapsing mass ( see puy & signore 1997 ) .",
    "we find ( see fig [ fig : temp ] ) that the turn - around temperature @xmath80 k without molecules and @xmath81 k for the turn - around temperature with molecules .",
    "the consequences could be important if we notice that the lower excitation temperature for @xmath12 ( main thermal molecular function ) is 112 k ( close to 100 k ) .",
    "this work shows a possible thermal modification , due to the primordial molecules , at the beginning of the collapse .",
    "this thermal mechanism could modify the initial conditions of a gravitational collapse .",
    "the following analysis could reveal processes of fragmentation trigerred by the thermal molecular function ( see puy & signore 1997 , 1998b ) .",
    "this last point is crucial for the estimation of the amplitude of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies .",
    "dubrovich ( 1977 , 1993 ) showed that resonant elastic scattering must be considered as the most efficient process in coupling matter and radiation at high redshift .",
    "he noted that the cross section for resonant scattering between the cosmic microwave background and molecules is several orders of magnitude larger than thomson scattering , even with a modest abundance of primordial molecules .",
