    "an andreev billiard consists of a finite normalconducting region with a boundary that is partly an interface to a superconductor .",
    "an electron with energy near the fermi energy can not propagate into the superconductor and it is trapped in a finite region similarly to a usual quantum billiard . however , the interface to the superconductor leads to an effective coupling of electron and hole dynamics through andreev scattering . if an electron hits the interface to the superconductor it is reflected back into the billiard as a hole in the opposite direction of the incoming electron ( this has been called `` retroflection '' to distinguish it from the specular reflection at an interface to an insulator ) .",
    "physically the electron enters the superconductor where it excites an electron - hole pair .",
    "it then builds a cooper pair with the electron while the hole is ejected back into the billiard .",
    "quasiparticle excitations in such a device are described by the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xmath0      \\delta(\\mathbf{x } ) & \\nabla^2-v(\\mathbf{x})+\\mu    \\end{pmatrix }    \\boldsymbol\\psi(\\mathbf{x})= e \\boldsymbol\\psi(\\mathbf{x})\\ .",

    "we have assumed time - reversal invariance which means that there is no magnetic field and the pair potential is a real function .",

    "this shows that the spectrum is symmetric around @xmath14 ( that is around the fermi energy ) and reveals that these systems belong to one of the seven non - standard symmetry classes @xcite ( the three standard or wigner - dyson symmetry classes classify quantum systems according to their behaviour under time - reversal and spin rotation ) .",
    "the negative spectrum describes hole - like quasiparticle excitations ( while the spectrum is negative , the physical energy of such an excitation is positive , of course ) and the positive spectrum describes electron - like quasiparticle excitations .",

    "in contrast an integrable normal billiard only leads to a suppressed density of states near the fermi energy @xcite .",

    "one may expect that the form of the averaged density of states now depends on the actual choice of amplitudes @xmath139 _ and _ on the central electron - electron scattering matrix @xmath107  and the same applies to the existence and size of spectral gaps . in this section",
    "we will only discuss the extreme case @xmath149  that is , at some peripheral vertex one has either complete andreev reflections @xmath150 or complete normal reflections @xmath151 .",

    "<S> we introduce andreev scattering ( electron - hole conversion at an interface of a normal conductor to a superconductor ) at the outer vertices of a quantum star graph and examine its effect on the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically we show that the density of states in andreev graphs is suppressed near the fermi energy where a spectral gap may occur . </S>",
    "<S> the size and existence of such a gap depends on one side on the andreev scattering amplitudes and , on the other side , on the properties of the electron - electron scattering matrix at the central vertex . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the bond length fluctuations have a minor effect on the spectrum near the fermi energy . </S>"
