    "fractional differential equations ( fdes ) have become more and more popular in applied science and engineering field recently .",
    "the history and mathematical background of fractional differential operators are given in @xcite with definitions and applications of fractional calculus .",
    "this kind of equations has been used increasingly in many fields , for example , in nature @xcite fractional operators applied in fractal stream chemistry and its implications for contaminant transport in catchments , in @xcite the fractional calculus motivated into bioengineering , and its application as a model for physical phenomena exhibiting anomalous diffusion , l@xmath1vy motion , turbulence @xcite , etc .",
    "let us briefly review the development of numerical methods for the fractional convection - diffusion equations .",
    "several authors have proposed a variety of high - order finite difference schemes for solving time - fractional convection - diffusion equations , for example @xcite , and solving space - fractional convection - diffusion equations @xcite . in @xcite , w. mclean and k. mustapha",
    "have used the piecewise - constant and piecewise - linear discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods to solve the time - fractional diffusion and wave equations , respectively .",
    "but these methods require more computational costs . in order to tackle those problems , in @xcite w. mclean",
    "has proposed an efficient scheme called fast summation by interval clustering to reduce the implementation memory ; more recent works on this issue can been in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite deng and hesthaven have developed dg methods for fractional spatial derivatives and given a fundamental frame to combine the dg methods with fractional operators . in @xcite xu and hesthaven have applied the dg methods to the fractional convection - diffusion equations in one dimension . in the two dimensional case , ji and tang @xcite have applied the dg methods to recast the fractional diffusion equations in rectangular meshes with the numerically optimal convergence order @xmath2 . however , there are no theoretical results .",
    "so far very few literatures deal with the fractional problems in triangular meshes , besides @xcite .",
    "this motives us to consider a successful dg method for solving the fractional problems in triangular meshes .    here",
    ", we consider the time - dependent space - fractional convection - diffusion problem @xmath3 in the domain @xmath4 and @xmath5 $ ] with the superdiffusion operators which are defined by the left riemann - liouville fractional derivatives @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath9 is a source term ; the convection coefficient @xmath10 is supposed to satisfy @xmath11 , and the initial function @xmath12 .    in this work",
    ", we shall design a stable and accurate dg method for ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the stability and convergence are proved in multi - dimensional case .",
    "this development is built on the extension of the previous dg works found in @xcite , where a qualitative study of the high - order local dg methods was discussed and some theoretical results were offered in one space dimension . in order to perform the error analysis , the authors defined some projection operators to prove the convergence results . unfortunately , the defined projection operators can not be easily extended to two dimensional case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , to avoid this difficulty , a different dg method is designed in this paper by carefully choosing the numerical fluxes and adding penalty terms .",
    "the presented hybridized discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) method has the following attractive properties : 1 ) the hdg method can be used for other fractional problems , for example , fractional diffusion equations ; 2 ) it has excellent provable stability , i.e. , the stability can be proved in any space dimensions ; 3 ) theoretically , the error analysis can be more easily performed with the general analytical methods in any space dimensions .",
