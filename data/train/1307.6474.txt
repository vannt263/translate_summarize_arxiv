    "the scheme for quantum information processing described in the main text exploits a cooper - pair box ( cpb ) [ ] , whose hamiltonian can be written in the basis of the charge states @xmath124 ( with @xmath125 ) [ ] as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the josephson energy , @xmath128 is the charging energy and @xmath129 is the dimensionless gate charge .",
    "the numerical diagonalization of ( [ cpb2 ] ) with @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 [ ] yields a highly anharmonic spectrum .",
    "hence , we can safely truncate the hilbert space of the cpb to the lowest three levels shown in the central part of fig .",
    "2(b ) of the main text . in this regime coherence times of the cpb",
    "are considerably longer than the cz gating time [ ] and the spectrum is sufficiently anharmonic to obtain high fidelities in our simulations .",
    "we describe here a simpler setup , which could be exploited for the first proof - of - principle experiments .",
    "this is formed by a cpb and two distinguishable spin @xmath17 ensembles @xmath20 and @xmath23 within the same cavity .",
    "we exploit the lowest three levels of the cpb : @xmath35 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , with transition energies @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath38 is assumed ) .",
    "the excitation energies of the spin ensembles are @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "two different harmonics of the resonator are taken into account , of frequency @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath19 is intermediate between @xmath18 and @xmath27 , while @xmath22 is intermediate between @xmath21 and @xmath28 . in this way",
    "the cavity mode @xmath19 ( @xmath22 ) can be coupled both to the spin gap @xmath18 ( @xmath21 ) and to the superconducting gap @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , by tuning its frequency .",
    "we recall here the definition of the logical 2-qubit states : @xmath135 we note that the cpb does not enter in the definition of the qubits : in the idle configuration it remains in its ground state @xmath35 .",
    "single - qubit rotations are implemented in a way similar to that described in the text : rotations about the @xmath61 axis of the bloch sphere , @xmath59 , are realized by means of off - resonant pulses , while @xmath68 are performed by tuning @xmath136 to @xmath29 for the proper amount of time ( @xmath137 ) .    by exploiting the hybrid encoding ( [ logical ] ) the cz gate",
    "can be implemented as in the scalable setup . here ,",
    "however , a single resonator is considered and thus photon - hopping does not occur . as stated in the text , cz is performed with a two - step rabi oscillation of the cpb between @xmath35 and @xmath134 accompanied by the absorption and emission of the two photons entering the definition of the two qubits .",
    "this is done through the intermediate states : @xmath138     during the simulation of a cz in the simpler setup described for the first proof - of - principle experiments.,width=302 ]    we now examine the effect of the three - step pulse sequence used to implement cz on the four logical states ( [ logical ] ) .",
    "* let s start by considering the two qubits initially prepared in state @xmath82 .",
    "first step : @xmath19 is tuned to @xmath27 by means of a @xmath83-pulse , which transfers the excitation from the photon @xmath20 to the intermediate level @xmath133 of the cpb , carrying the system to state @xmath139 .",
    "second step : a @xmath140-pulse brings @xmath22 into resonance with @xmath28 , thus inducing a full rabi oscillation between states @xmath139 and @xmath141 .",
    "third step : the repetition of the first pulse brings back the system to @xmath82 , with a phase @xmath83 acquired during the rabi flop in the second step .",
    "the extra phase due to the absorption / emission processes occurring in the first and third steps can be set to zero by properly choosing the delay between the two corresponding @xmath83-pulses . *",
    "if the system is initially in @xmath99 there is only the photon of frequency @xmath19 and the @xmath140-pulse ( second step ) leaves the state @xmath139 unaffected .",
    "the two @xmath83-pulses ( first and third steps ) brings the state from @xmath99 to @xmath139 and back , but the phase acquired during this process is set to zero by the same delay fixed previously .",
    "* if the system is in @xmath142 , the two @xmath83-pulses do not induce any transition .",
    "in fact , in this state there is only a photon in mode @xmath23 which is never brought into resonance with the transition @xmath27 .",
    "thus , also the rabi swap ( second step ) is ineffective , as the cpb is always in its ground state . *",
    "finally , state @xmath100 is completely unaffected by the present sequence .",
    "hence , the sequence of pulses described above implements a cz , i.e. , in matrix representation on basis ( [ logical ] ) : @xmath143 as photon - hopping is not required , the gating times are reduced with respect to the scalable setup , to about @xmath144 ( see the simulation reported in fig . [ proof ] ) .",
    "following [ ] , we include the photon leakage by modeling the evolution of the system as due to an effective hamiltonian @xmath145 involving the complex cavity frequencies @xmath146 . with this substitution the photon part of the hamiltonian changes into @xmath147 \\hat{a}_\\gamma^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}_\\gamma .\\ ] ] here @xmath148 is the cavity loss rate , assumed in the 10 khz range [ ] , and @xmath136 are the real frequencies introduced in the text . fig . [ leakage ]",
    "shows the absolute squared value of the components of the system wave - function as a function of time , during the simulation of a @xmath149 and of a cz gate .",
    "no significant difference can be noted with respect to fig .",
    "3(b ) of the text : the non - hermitian evolution due to @xmath145 leads only to few photons lost over thousand during our gating times . finally , it has been experimentally shown that pure dephasing of the cavity modes is negligible ( see , e.g. , [ ] where the measured value of the dephasing time @xmath150 approximately corresponds to twice the value of the photon decay time @xmath151 ) .",
    "in the simulations reported in the text the cavity modes are modulated by means of step - like pulses .",
    "we have checked that the same results can be achieved by linearly varying the resonator frequency on a timescale @xmath152 : this regime is well within the validity of the rotating - wave approximation and no generation of unwanted photons due to dynamical - casimir effect is observed [ ] .",

    "<S> another promising class of spin systems is represented by molecular nanomagnets ( mnms ) [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> these spin clusters form crystals in which the molecules behave as identical and non - interacting magnetic units , and can be diluted by using non - magnetic analogues . besides </S>",
    "<S> , mnms present degrees of freedom , such as spin chirality , that can be manipulated by the electric - field component of the cavity field [ ] and are substantially protected from the magnetic environment [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have developed a scheme for quantum - information processing with spin ensembles in superconducting stripline resonators , exploiting a hybrid spin - photon encoding of the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is qualitatively different from previous ones because the spin and photon degrees of freedom enter the definition of the qubit on an equal footing . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution can be induced simply by tuning the cavity frequency to the spin - energy gaps . </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary single and two - qubit gates are implemented , over much shorter times than typical decoherence times of cavity - photons and spin - ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> promising candidates for the spin degrees of freedom are diluted magnetic ions or molecular nanomagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the application of this scheme to an @xmath123 array of cavities enables general quantum algorithms as well as quantum simulators [ ] to be implemented . </S>",
    "<S> + very useful discussions with a. auffves are gratefully acknowledged . </S>",
    "<S> this work was financially supported by the italian firb project `` new challenges in molecular nanomagnetism : from spin dynamics to quantum - information processing '' and by fondazione cariparma . </S>"
