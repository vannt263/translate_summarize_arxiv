    "as a lot of researchers suggest [ 1 - 5 ] , entanglement is one of the most mysterious aspects of quantum physics .",
    "although it is by now possible to verify the predictions of entanglement theory in a variety of experiments [ 2 ] , there remains a considerable gap between the formal definition of entanglement and the observable effects that are associated with this property .",
    "a major thrust of current research is to find a quantitative measure of entanglement for general states . for the experiments in the newest fields of physics , quantum computing , quantum communication , and quantum cryptography [ 6 - 13 ]",
    "the quantitative analysis of the multi - qubit or ion is of substantial interest [ 14 ] .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction between two atoms can be understood through the exchange of virtual photons and depends on the transition dipole moment of the levels involved .",
    "it can be characterized by complex coupling constants , or by their real and imaginary parts , where the former affect decay constants and the latter lead to level shifts [ 15,16 ] .",
    "there is an inherent interest in analytical and non - perturbative solutions of multi - atom interacting with the cavity field problems , all the more considering quantum systems with more than one qubit .",
    "one examples of such kind is the system of two two - level qubits in an electromagnetic field [ 14 - 26 ] .",
    "entanglement of identical qubits is a property dependent on which single - qubit basis is chosen , as any operation should act on each identical qubit in the same way . indeed , individual qubits are excitations of a quantum field , and the single - qubit basis defines which set of qubits are used in representing the many - qubit state [ 27 ] .",
    "the analysis of entanglement sharing of the two - atom tavis - cummings model has been discussed in ref . [",
    "recently , interest has mounted in exploring the quantum system composed of two qubits interacting with a thermal field [ 29 ] .",
    "we have addressed a general two - qubit system in a recent paper [ 23 ] in which an analytical expression for the temporal evolution of the pancharatnam phase when the field starts from vacuum state is given .",
    "this has motivated us to criticize the conception of entanglement of a two - qubit system in the context of the mixed quantum states .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to synthesize conceptual insights that already exist to push forward a more coherent view of how concurrence as an entanglement measure of a two - qubit system might make progress in understanding the two - qubit entanglement . to be more precise , we assume that two two - level atoms ( two qubits ) share a bipartite system , taking into account the multi - photon transition . another principal aim is to elucidate the extent to which mixed entangled states can affect the entanglement .",
    "the emphasis being put on the investigation of the entanglement in a more general situation in which the two atoms ( qubits ) share a mixed state , rather than a pure state and we propose to use the concurrence hierarchy as a measurement of entanglement [ 30 - 32 ] .",
    "the issue of attributing objective properties to the constituents of a quantum system composed of two qubits , does not turn out to be a straightforward generalization of the just analyzed case involving distinguishable qubits , and the problem of entanglement has to be reconsidered .",
    "entangled mixed states may arise when one or both qubits of an initially pure entangled state interact , intentionally or inadvertently , with other quantum degrees of freedom resulting in a non - unitary evolution of the pure state into a mixed state . in general it is known that there are also cases when entangled states are mixed with other entangled states and where the sum is separable .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we devote section 2 to give a brief overview of the binomial states and initial states setting . in section 3",
    ", we present notations and definitions of the model and its analytical solution to be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "section 4 is devoted to consider the atomic inversion as well as the quasiprobability distribution .",
    "the concurrence as an entanglement measure is presented in section 5 , followed by a numerical computation in which we shall examine the influence of different involved parameters in subsection 5.1 .",
    "the paper is closes with the conclusions outlined in section 6 .",
    "the implementation independence in quantum information theory is guaranteed by the use of hilbert spaces , states and operations between and on them .",
    "it is not said , what they physically describe in more concrete terms , whether we are dealing with spins , polarizations , energy levels , qubit numbers , or whatever you can imagine .",
    "the features of nonclassical states visualize specific aspects of nonclassicality and do not yield a complete characterization of nonclassicality as a phenomenon on its own . in this section",
    "we give a brief overview of the binomial states [ 33 ] .",
    "for measuring the quantum state of the radiation field , balanced homodyning has become a well established method , it directly measures phase sensitive quadrature distributions .",
    "alternatively , unbalanced homodyning yields access to phase - space functions . for some systems , such as a cavity - field mode and a mode of the quantized motion of a trapped ion , methods have been proposed that allow for a direct detection of the characteristic functions of the quadratures .",
    "the binomial states are finite linear combinations of number states [ 33 ] @xmath0^{1/2}|n\\rangle , \\ ] ] which interpolate between some fundamental sates such as number states and coherent states , where @xmath1 is a non - negative integer , @xmath2 is areal probability @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a number state of the radiation field .",
    "such states have been studied in great detail in the literature ( see e.g. ref . [ 34 ] ) .",
    "the binomial states have the properties @xmath5 in the theory of open system or the reduction theory , one often considers two subsystem @xmath6 and @xmath7 represented by hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath8 be state spaces ( the set of all density operators ) and @xmath9 denotes the state space in the composite system . here",
    ", we assume that , before entering the cavity , the field initially in a binomial state such as @xmath10 in pure - state quantum mechanics the state of the system is usually represented by a normalized wavefunction , which is a unit vector in a hilbert space .",
    "entangled mixed states may arise when the qubits of an initially pure entangled state interact , intentionally or inadvertently , with other quantum degrees of freedom resulting in a non - unitary evolution of the pure state into a mixed state .",
    "in general it is known that there are also cases when entangled states are mixed with other entangled states and where the sum is separable .",
    "the usual interpretation of mixed states , is that their creation involves irreversibly destroying information [ 35,36 ] .",
    "this has interesting consequences concerning entanglement theory , since there , the irreversibility is often associated with the fact that one is dealing with mixed states .",
    "we assume that , the two two - level qubits initially prepared in the mixed states enter the cavity whose single mode under consideration , prior to the interaction with the qubits , is in the binomial state @xmath11 thus , the atomic density matrix is of the diagonal form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the atomic density matrix for the @xmath14 qubit .",
    "the initial state of the two qubits system can be written as @xmath15 it is well known that mixed states can be realized by an ensemble of pure states in an infinite number of ways .",
    "the determination of the separability of a state and the determination of its entanglement have in common that a particular realization of a state has to be found such that some property holds for all pure states in that realization . in order to find this optimal realization ,",
    "it is of considerable interest to have a mathematically elegant way of generating all possible realizations of a state [ 31 ] .",
    "we consider a mechanism through which a system of two qubits can be entangled in a cavity field .",
    "we assume that the qubits are modeled by two - level systems having multiphoton transition , which is a micromaser system [ 21 ] .",
    "the micromaser is an experimental realization of the idealized system of a two - level qubit interacting with a second quantized single - mode of the electromagnetic field [ 22 ] . in this section",
    "we consider a theoretical model which differs from the standard micromaser set - up in that instead of a single qubit we have assumed a pair of qubits interacting with a single mode of the cavity field ( see figure 1 ) . in the dipole and rotating wave approximation , one can write @xmath16    ( @xmath17 ) the @xmath18 qubit s upper ( lower ) level and @xmath19 are the virtual levels . , width=529 ]    @xmath20 + \\omega_{2}\\left [ s_{ee}^{(2)}-s_{gg}^{(2 ) } \\right ] + \\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}\\{\\beta_{1}^{(1)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(1 ) } \\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{(1 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\beta_{1}^{(2)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(2)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{(2)}+\\beta _ { 2}^{(1)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{(1)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(1)}+\\beta_{2}^{(2)}\\hat { \\sigma}_{+}^{(2)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(2)}\\}\\theta ( k)+\\gamma_{1}s_{eg}^{(1 ) } \\hat{a}^{k } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\gamma_{1}^{\\ast } s_{ge}^{(1)}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger k}+\\gamma_{2}s_{eg}^{(2 ) } \\hat{a}^{k}+\\gamma_{2}^{\\ast } \\hat{a}^{\\dagger k}s_{ge}^{(2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we denote by @xmath21 the atomic operators for the @xmath22 qubit . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are field operators corresponding to annihilation and creation of photons in the cavity mode .",

    ", this problem can be treated numerically .",
    "if we consider the dispersive approximation in which @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the dipole coupling constant ) and the second qubit is weakly coupled to the field , an explicit expression for the final state @xmath55 can be easily obtained [ 37,38 ] . in that case",
    ", it is straightforward to obtain explicit expressions for @xmath56 , namely , @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60    a downside of analyzing more complex atomic system is that analytic expressions for the final state functions and , consequently , for the matrix elements are not always available .",
    "therefore , the greatest benefit of equation ( 10 ) which represents an analytical solution of the final state of the system for this general model , is that it directly yields a method for actually calculating any property related to the system .",

    "we see that the total atomic inversion has rapid oscillations with a periodical collapses and revivals .",
    "this discussion has clearly demonstrated that the general behavior of the total atomic inversion , when the two - photon transition is involved , is remarkably affected by changing the number of quanta and @xmath88 is almost periodic .",
    "this periodicity follows a consequence of the fact that the generalized rabi frequency in the two - photon transition is proportional to @xmath90 rather than to @xmath91 which is the case in the single - photon process .",
    "in the presence of the stark shifts namely @xmath92 we note that the rabi frequency as well as the temporal width of the oscillations packets decrease ( see figure 3b ) .",
    "the most obvious difference , is that the population inversion collapses to a nonzero value with the inclusion of stark shifts but to a zero value without it .",

    "the evolution of the atomic inversion still exhibits rabi oscillations , showing collapses and revivals .",
    "the oscillations are independent of @xmath97 but @xmath98 strikingly affects the amplitude of the inversion ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "as soon as we take @xmath98 effect into consideration it is easy to realize that the amplitude of the oscillations is decreased .",
    "furthermore if we take larger values of the binomial parameter @xmath2 , the revival time is elongated and the atomic inversion oscillates around zero .    at this end and after discussing a particular aspect of the atomic inversion in the multi - photon two two - level qubits model with the initial field prepared in the binomial state , which clearly exhibits the collapses - revivals phenomenon and provide us with information about the discrete nature of the quantum qubit - cavity field eigenvalues , we are going to focus our attention on the representation of the field in phase space which provides some aspects of the field dynamics .",
    "perhaps the most convenient quasiprobability to be used in this kind of problem is the @xmath99 function .",
    "the first step to be taken is the calculation of the reduced density operator for the field @xmath100 , and then we get the @xmath99 function as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a coherent state with amplitude @xmath103 the @xmath99function is not only a convenient tool to calculate expectation values of anti - normally ordered products of operators , but also gives us a new insight into the mechanism of interaction in the model under consideration .",
    "figure 5 shows a contour plot of the reduced density matrix @xmath104function quasiprobability for different values of the binomial parameter @xmath105 when @xmath2 increases , the @xmath99function bifurcates into two blobs rotating in the complex coherent state parameter plane in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions with the same speed .",
    "the collision of the blobs corresponds to the revival .",
    "this can be clearly seen if we compare the numerical calculations for inversion and @xmath99function .",
    "the characterization and classification of entanglement in quantum mechanics is one of the cornerstones of the emerging field of quantum information theory .",
    "although an entangled two - qubit state @xmath106 is not equal to the product @xmath107 and @xmath108 of the two single - qubit states contained in it , it may very well be a convex sum of such products .",
    "in general it is known that microscopic entangled states are found that to be very stable , for example electron - sharing in atomic bonding and two - qubit entangled photon states generated by parametric down conversion .",
    "entanglement as one of the most nonclassical features of quantum mechanics is usually arisen from quantum correlations between separated subsystems which can not be created by local actions on each subsystem .",
    "as more and more experimental realizations of entanglement sources become available , it is necessary to develop different methods of measuring the entanglement produced by different sources [ 39 ] .",
    "an ensemble is specified by a set of pairs @xmath109 , consisting of @xmath110 state vectors @xmath111 and associated statistical weights @xmath112 , and , @xmath113 is called the cardinality of the ensemble .",

    ", we clarify that it can be done by using the different initial state , which is strongly affected by the atomic number representation .",
    "this naturally leads to the use of occupation numbers of different single - qubit basis states in quantifying multi - qubit entanglement even when the number of qubits is conserved .",
    "the occupation - numbers of different modes have already been used in quantum computing [ 43 ] .",

    "[ 44 ] in which experimentally a superposition state of the ground state and a non - maximally entangled antisymmetric state in two trapped ions has been realized . in the experiment two",
    "trapped barium ions were sideband cooled to their motional ground states .",
    "transitions between the states of the ions were induced by raman pulses using co - propagating lasers .",
    "the non - maximally entangled state was used [ 45 ] to demonstrate the intrinsic difference between quantum and classical information transfers .",
    "the difference arises from the different ways in which the probabilities occur and is particularly clear in terms of entangled states .",
    "before we conclude , it is necessary to give a brief discussion on the experimental realization of the present model .",
    "it was reported that the cavity can have a photon storage time of @xmath185 ms ( corresponding to @xmath186 ) .",
    "the radiative time of the rydberg atoms with the principle quantum numbers @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 is about @xmath190 . the coupling constant of the atoms to the cavity field is @xmath191",

    "the experiment may be described schematically as follows : a stream of pairs of rubidium atoms in circular rydberg states , time and velocity selected , was sent through a resonant cavity [ 47 ] .",
    "each pair consisted of one atom in a state with principle quantum number 51 , and the other in a state with principle quantum number 50 , the frequency of transition between the two states being 51.1 ghz .",
    "also , there was an experiment [ 47 ] in which the phase of oscillation of each of two entangled qubits is individually controlled and can be adjusted to provide the necessary values for testing a bell inequality .",
    "to sum up , in the main part of this paper we have investigated the properties of the dynamically emerging entanglement in the multiphoton two two - level qubits .",
    "we have treated the more general case where initial states of the two qubits can be mixed with a binomial state of the field .",
    "we have obtained an exact solution of the density operator taking into account the dispersive limit , and thus provides insight into the behavior of more complicated two - qubit systems .",
    "we have investigated the interaction of the binomial states ( which reduce to number and coherent states in two different limits ) with atomic systems in the framework of the two two - level qubits , and describe the response of the atomic system as it varies between the rabi oscillations and the collapse - revival mode and investigate the total atomic inversion and the quasiprobability distributions .",
    "the idea of using the concurrence as an entanglement measure offers many attractive features .",
    "entanglement is measured via the concurrence , currently used only for an arbitrary system of two qubits , but similar analysis can in principle be applied to other systems such as a bipartite system with arbitrary dimensions .",
    "as we anticipated , this system exhibits some novel features in comparison with the single qubit system .",
    "we have found that some different regimes occur , depending on the actual initial joint product state , the number of quanta and the binomial state parameters .",
    "it was demonstrated that quantum entanglement is stored in the model system considered , and that the nature of this entanglement is strongly dependent on the detuning of the atomic levels , an effect that may have important consequences in other nonlinear processes .",
