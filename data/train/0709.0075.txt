    "the amplitude analysis of non - leptonic three body b decays became an important tool to determine the ckm phases @xcite , and also to observe cp - asymmetry . using this method ,",
    "the belle and babar collaborations have recently @xcite extracted a fraction asymmetry for the channel @xmath2 . with this kind of analysis",
    "one could also explore the asymmetry associated with the interference between two neighbour resonances decaying into the same three body final state .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis needs some _ a priori _ model , with all possible dynamical components and a correct functional form to be used to fit the dalitz plot distribution .",
    "arbitrary distribution functions can be used to get a good fit , but they have no physical meaning .    the non - resonant component",
    "which , in general , is spread all over the phase space , can mimic other dynamical components , through the interferences with the resonances present in the same phase space .",
    "this shadowing phenomenon was observed in charm three body decays in the e791 experiment @xcite , where the overestimated contribution of the non - resonant amplitude replaced , in a wrong way , the contribution ( and the very existence ) of the scalar mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the function above could fit the data with an acceptable confidence level around 1% .",
    "certainly this distribution was more useful for the belle analysis than the usual constant non - resonant distribution .",
    "however , it has to be employed with caution .",
    "the use of an empirical parametrization , with a form without dynamical content , may hide the physical meaning of the dalitz plot and , even worse , may yield inadequate parameters for the contribution of the resonance amplitudes and for the cp asymmetries .",
    "this is so because in the dalitz distribution the parameters are highly correlated among themselves and also with the non - resonant amplitude .",
    "the parametrization ( [ anr ] ) was proposed to describe non - uniformities in the non - resonant three - body decays .",
    "data suggest the formation of a @xmath13 with momentum predominantly smaller than the momentum of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the process @xmath16 .",
    "how can we understand this ?    in principle",
    "there are two different cathegories of dynamical processes contributing to the non - resonant structures in the dalitz plot .",
    "one is a genuine three - body decay that is a consequence of the partonic structure of the weak decay @xcite and therefore will be called parton interaction , or pi .",
    "the other comes from final state hadron - hadron interactions @xcite and we shall call it fsi . in both approaches one is forced to make non - trivial calculation assumptions and the parameters and form factors are not well known .",
    "however as we are dealing with dalitz distributions , the comparison of these different contributions with the experimental distributions might discriminate which dynamical mechanism is more realistic to describe data .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the diagrams relevant for the partonic description of this process . figs .",
    "1a and 1b show the direct and penguin contribution to the `` current induced '' processes . figs .",
    "1c ) , 1d ) and 1e ) show the direct ( 1c ) ) and and penguin ( 1d ) and 1e ) ) contributions to the `` transition '' processes and and figs .",
    "1f ) and 1 g ) show the direct and penguin `` annihilation '' processes .",
    "looking at diagrams 1a ) to 1e ) we can see that in the beginning both @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks can carry a large momentum . when they emit a @xmath19 or a gluon",
    ", the bosons can also carry a large momentum and therefore , with the exception of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks ( which come always from the vacuum and are soft ) any of the quarks in the final state may carry a large momentum . this large momentum",
    "is then transferred to the final mesons .",
    "the final momentum distribution of the three mesons will be eventually non - uniform but there is no reason for producing a softer @xmath13 .",
    "the `` entanglement '' of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and bosonic lines will distribute more or less democratically the initial high momenta .",
    "in sharp contrast to this situation are diagrams 1f ) and 1 g ) , where after the boson emission and absorption the high momenta are _ only _ with the @xmath18 and @xmath22 quarks . in the middle of the diagrams we see",
    "the @xmath13 made of @xmath18 and @xmath20 quarks pairs taken from the vacuum .",
    "this @xmath13 will be comparatively softer than the negative pions of diagrams 1a ) - 1e ) .",
    "when the final three mesons are produced through final state interactions we can also understand the softer @xmath13 in a very simple way : first the @xmath23 decays into @xmath14 and @xmath24 and then these interact creating @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first two mesons carry the valence quarks of the more energetic intermediate @xmath14 and @xmath24 and therefore will have higher momenta .",
    "the @xmath13 is produced with quarks taken from the vacuum and therefore is softer .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fsi1 ] .",
    "thus the appearance of a comparatively soft @xmath13 is nothing but the manifestation of the `` leading particle effect '' , so frequently observed in other processes in hadron physics .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this kind of process has been first observed in a dalitz plot by the aachen - berlin - cern collaboration in the reaction @xmath25 @xcite and also in @xmath26 @xcite . shortly after the experimental observation it was theoretically understood in @xcite . in that paper",
    "it was explained in terms of double regge graphs .",
    "this mechanism implies the production of a soft pion in the central region , responsible for a bump at the corner of the dalitz plot , hence the name _ cornering effect_.    the analysis performed in @xcite , suggests that in the chiral limit approximation , i.e. when @xmath27 , diagram 1f ) vanishes .",
    "it also suggests that the most important process is the one shown in fig .",
    "1 g ) , which has a striking similarity with the diagram of fig .",
    "both have the same final quark flow and final meson formation .    from the above qualitative discussion and from figures 1 g ) and [ fsi1 ]",
    "we conclude that in the decay @xmath28 we expect to see a softer @xmath13 which will yield a non - uniform dalitz distribution .",
    "this effect comes both from the partonic weak decay and from final state hadronic interactions and has , in both cases , the same physical origin : valence quarks form hard mesons in the final state while softer mesons are produced from the vacuum . neglecting the flavor change ( @xmath29 ) in fig",
    ". 1 g ) , we can say that in both cases , pi and fsi , we have a leading particle effect .    in",
    "what follows we will implement these ideas in a more quantitative way .",
    "in view of the uncertainties in the partonic description , specially the use of the factorization hypothesis , we will develop here only the hadronic final state interaction approach , for which the relevant lagrangian densities and form factors are better known from a large body of phenomenological studies at low and intermediate energies .",
    "therefore we shall suppose that the non - resonant three - body decay @xmath30 proceeds through a hadronic scattering between two intermediate mesons @xmath31 and @xmath24 in the two - body decay @xmath32 .",
    "hadronic final state interactions have a long story and follow two different approaches : regge models and meson exchange models .",
    "the former have been considered in many works @xcite whereas the latter were discussed in @xcite .",
    "regge theory is formulated in the high energy limit and in it all the amplitudes respect unitarity constraints .",
    "the interactions are represented by reggeon exchanges , the pomeron being usually the most important one .",
    "as one moves to the low energy region , secondary reggeons become important , additional assumptions have to be made and the theory looses predictive power .",
    "it is not clear when the energy starts to be `` high '' and regge theory has been applied to energies of the order of a few gev .",
    "meson exchange models describe hadronic interactions fairly well at intermediate energies ( a few hundreds mev ) .",
    "they contain uncertainties associated with higher order diagrams , multiple exchange terms , coupling constants and the spatial extension of hadrons .",
    "these uncertainties are translated into form factors , which , in turn , can be either calculated ( e.g. with qcd sum rules @xcite ) or simply parametrized and fitted to data .",
    "a positive aspect of meson exchange models is that one can use effective lagrangians for them and so enforce chiral symmetry , which is known to be very important at intermediate energies . on the other hand , in this kind of model ,",
    "the amplitudes are not unitary .",
    "the lack of unitarity is believed to become a serious problem at increasing energies .",
    "these considerations suggest that with inceasing energies we should change the dynamical description , going from meson exchange to reggeon exchange , but is not clear _ at which energy _",
    "this should be done . in this work",
    "we shall study final state interactions with meson dynamics .    in principle",
    "the @xmath1 meson can decay into inumerous hadronic two - body intermediate states which will subsequently decay into @xmath33 .",
    "these states include : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ... these mesons can undergo a two - to - three reaction , exchanging virtual mesons and creating the @xmath13 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fsi1 ] for the @xmath35 intermediate state , which we will use as working example .",
    "a more careful analysis reveals that some of the above mentioned two - body states can be excluded because their interactions yielding a @xmath46 final state would violate @xmath47 parity ( this is the case of the @xmath34 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "some other states are much less abundant as two body decays .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 states , which branching fraction is one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath35 one .",
    "other diagrams are suppressed by dual topological unitarity ( dtu ) @xcite .",
    "finally , some other states , inspite of being different , are expected to yield amplitudes which are qualitatively very similar .",
    "this is , for example , the case of the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 . replacing @xmath24 by @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fsi1 ] will lead to a similar diagram with the vertex @xmath49 instead of @xmath50 . this will change the corresponding coupling constant and the form factor .",
    "the former is unable to distort the dalitz plot and irrelevant for our discussion . in both vertices",
    "the form factor will suppress highly virtual internal @xmath51 mesons .",
    "we therefore expect these two diagrams to give similar results .",
    "even after a careful scrutiny and the elimination of suppressed diagrams and of `` double counting '' , there will remain a few diagrams to be considered . here",
    "we shall work out in detail only the process depicted in fig .",
    "this will show schematically how the final state meson dynamics will lead to inhomogeneities in the dalitz plot .    before starting the evaluation of the feynman diagram given in fig .",
    "[ fsi1 ] , one last remark is in order . in other fsi calculations , such as @xcite the starting point is the @xmath1 meson , which decays into two off - shell mesons , which , in turn exchange a third virtual meson .",
    "this process is described by a loop diagram , from which the absorptive part is considered . in our fig .",
    "[ fsi1 ] this procedure would be equivalent to close the lower part of the diagram forming a loop with a virtual @xmath14 and a virtual @xmath24 . here , for simplicity , we take them to be real . in this way we will give emphasis to the creation of the soft @xmath13 and consequent dalitz plot distortion .",
    "the loop integral will introduce some smearing in our result and presumably change the normalization .",
    "since our purpose in this work is to discuss this process qualitatively , we postpone to the future a more general calculation , including effects of the kaon and pion off - shellness .",
    "the effective lagrangians relevant to the calculation can be constructed from a chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "they are :    @xmath52    with the above interaction lagrangians , we can write the amplitude for the diagram in fig .
