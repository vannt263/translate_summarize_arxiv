    "currently , the second generation large - scale laser interferometric gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors : advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , and kagra @xcite are under construction . in particular , construction of two advanced ligo interferometers is almost complete and they will start to gather scientific data soon . sensitivities of these detectors are expected to be limited by the quantum noise .",
    "namely , at higher frequencies the shot noise will dominate , originating from quantum fluctuation of the phase of the optical field inside the interferometer . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the radiation pressure noise created by the amplitude fluctuations will constitute the major part of the noise budget .",
    "the shot noise is inversely proportional to the optical power circulating inside the interferometer , while the radiation pressure noise is proportional to it@xcite  the optimal point where these two noises are equal to each other is known as the standard quantum limit ( sql)@xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the sql represents an ultimate sensitivity limit only for a simplest class of position measurement schemes , which , however , encompasses the baseline design of all second generation gw detectors ( see details below in sec.[sec : s_sum ] ) .",
    "several methods of overcoming this limit suitable for the laser gw detectors were proposed ( see _ e.g._the review paper @xcite ; we discuss briefly two most well known ones in sec.[sec : s_sum ] ) . in most cases ,",
    "they require significant modifications in the interferometer design ; and in order to take full advantage of these methods , the other noise sources of non - quantum origin ( so - called technical noise ) have to be suppressed correspondingly . due to the these reasons",
    ", these configurations typically are considered as possible candidates for implementation only in the planned third - generation gw detectors @xcite , like the einstein telescope @xcite or the ligo iii @xcite , where the technical noise will be reduced by about one order of magnitude ( in comparison to the second generation detectors ) . in particular , a so - called _ xylophone _ configuration is planned for the einstein telescope @xcite , which consists of two independent interferometers , optimized for low - frequency and high - frequency gw signals , respectively .",
    "however , in the planned advanced ligo noise budget , there is a quite large margin between the quantum noise and the technical noise in the low - frequency band @xmath0 @xcite , opening the opportunity to improve the sensitivity in this important frequency band by using one a simplified form of one of the above mentioned methods . in particular , the injection of frequency - dependent squeezed light created by means of a single relatively short ( 16 m ) filter cavity ( a simplified form of the _ pre - filtering _",
    "topology proposed in @xcite ) is considered as a very probable option for upgrading during some later stage of the advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "another approach to reducing quantum noise in gw detectors is modification of the test masses dynamics by means of the _ optical spring _",
    "effect which arises in the detuned interferometers @xcite .",
    "the optical springs convert gw detectors test masses into harmonic oscillators with eigenfrequencies within the detection band ( rigorously speaking , this approach does not allow to overcome the sql , but instead reduces the sql itself around the eigenfrequency ) .",
    "unfortunately , the optical springs allow to improve the sensitivity in a limited frequency band , while substantially degrading it at other frequencies .",
    "a further development of this method was proposed in papers @xcite .",
    "it is based on use of two optical carriers which create two optical springs of the opposite signs .",
    "provided the appropriate power , detuning and bandwidth of the carriers , the total effect of the double optical spring can be described as a _ negative optical inertia_. it cancels the positive inertia of the test masses , thus increasing their response to gravitational waves and correspondingly reducing the sql within a broad band from zero frequency to some upper frequency limited by the available optical power .",
    "unfortunately , estimates show that for parameters planned for the advanced ligo , this upper frequency is equal to only @xmath1 , and scales very slowly ( as @xmath2 ) with the circulating optical power @xmath3 @xcite .    in the articles @xcite",
    "the double - carrier configuration was proposed as a mean to create a dynamically stable optical spring .",
    "the scheme considered in @xcite is shown in fig.[fig : scheme ] .",
    "in essence , this is the standard michelson / fabry - prot topology of the second generation gw detectors , but with two optical pump sources , which either have to have orthogonal polarizations , or have to be separated by one or more fsrs of the interferometer , in order to avoid interference between them .",
    "each of the two output beams is supposed to be measured by its own homodyne detector , and their output signals are combined with the optimal weight functions .",
    "in addition , the so called _ annihilation _ regime was considered in @xcite , which uses the two carriers with equal power and opposite detunings ; as a result , the optical springs created by these two carriers completely cancel each other . here",
    ", we analyze this regime in more detail and show , that it allows to reduce the radiation pressure noise in the second generation gw detectors down to the level of their technical noise .",
    "we show also , that using a several such pairs , it is possible to implement the xylophone configuration within the single interferometer .",
    "we assume in this paper , that the main parameters of the interferometer correspond to the ones planned for the advanced ligo @xcite , see table[tab : notations ] .",
    "in particular , we suppose , that the total circulating optical power of the all carriers is limited to @xmath4 , which corresponds to the normalized power @xmath5 ( the main notations used throughout this paper are listed in table[tab : notations ] ) . we suppose also that for each carrier , a frequency - independent squeezed light can be injected into the dark port of the interferometer as it was proposed by c.  caves in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly review the main features of quantum noise in the gw detectors . in sec.[sec : idea ] we analyze the main features of the multi - carrier quantum noise . in sec.[sec : optimization ] , we present the results of the numerical optimization of this noise .",
    "in sec.[sec : discussion ] , we discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method and the prospects of its use in future gw detectors . in the appendix , the effective quantum noise spectral densities for the multi - carrier configuration are calculated .        at high frequency , the radiation pressure noise can be neglected . in this case ,",
    "our goal is to get the most broadband shot noise spectral density centered at some given frequency @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we minimize the product of the low- and high - frequency asymptotics @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the pair number , in @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for a given value of @xmath6 :          the minimum of in @xmath16 is provided by @xmath17 in this case , @xmath18 .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] if @xmath19 then this spectral density has a sharp minimum at @xmath20 . in this case",
    "@xmath21 therefore , the value of the minimum and its width are equal to @xmath22"

    "<S> we explore new regimes of laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors with multiple optical carriers which allow to reduce the quantum noise of these detectors . in particular , we show that using two carriers with the opposite detunings , homodyne angles , and squeezing angles , but identical other parameters ( the antisymmetric carriers ) , one can suppress the quantum noise in such a way that its spectrum follows the standard quantum limit ( sql ) at low frequencies . relaxing this antisymmetry condition , it is also possible to slightly overcome the sql in broadband . combining several such pairs in the xylophone configuration , it is possible to shape the quantum noise spectrum flexibly . </S>"
