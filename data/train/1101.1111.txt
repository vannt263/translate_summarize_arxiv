    "the largest red supergiants have a radius of @xmath14 cm @xcite so that the longest time of the breakout event is about 1 hour .",

    "@xcite was fortunate .",
    "the situation changes if there is dense mass loss prior to the supernova that creates an optically thick region .",
    "calculations of this case go back to early computer simulations of supernova light curves . model 5 of @xcite and model b of @xcite include a dense circumstellar shell with radius @xmath15 cm that determines the properties of the shock breakout .",
    "the peak luminosity occurs on a timescale of @xmath16 days in the model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a steady wind of limited duration just before the supernova .",
    "@xcite calculated a model for sn 1994w which allows for dense mass loss around the supernova , leading to a peak luminosity at an age of @xmath17 days .",
    "a systematic numerical study of such events has recently been carried out by @xcite .",
    "because of the high surrounding density , the supernova can be especially bright and this type of model has been invoked for luminous supernovae .",
    "in addition to sn 1994w @xcite , application of the dense mass loss model has been made to sn 2006gy @xcite , ptf 09uj @xcite , and sn 2009kf @xcite , among others .",
    "the aim here is to give an analytical description of the shock breakout process for the case where a radiation dominated shock propagates into the mass loss region .",
    "progress on this front has been made by @xcite .",
    "the model is presented in   2 and compared to observations in   3 .",
    "we assume that the dense mass loss can be described by a steady wind acting for some time @xmath18 before the supernova explosion ; the extent is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the wind velocity .",
    "the actual case may be more complex , but is not well determined ; the wind assumption has been made in other work @xcite .",
    "if the mass loss is in a steady wind , the density @xmath21 can be specified by a density parameter , @xmath22 , scaled to a @xmath23 and @xmath24 wind so that @xmath25 in cgs units . for typical supernova parameters ,",
    "the explosion drives a radiation dominated shock through the star .",
    "a radiation dominated shock in a uniform medium has a characteristic thickness described by an optical depth @xmath26 , where @xmath5 is the shock velocity @xcite .",
    "if the wind optical depth @xmath27 , then a radiation dominated shock does not form in the wind and the radiation diffuses out through an optically thick wind ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case that @xmath28 , the radiation dominated shock front propagates into the mass loss region .",
    "this is the case considered here .",
    "after the shock wave passes through the star and the supernova ejecta tend toward free expansion , a shocked layer develops in the wind that is bounded by forward and reverse shock waves at @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the shock waves are initially energy conserving .",
    "once the forward shock front reaches a place where the diffusion time equals the expansion time or , equivalently , @xmath31 , radiation diffusion becomes important .",
    "we have @xmath32 , so the diffusion condition can be written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 cm , where @xmath35 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the opacity @xmath4 in units of 0.34 @xmath38 g@xmath39 .",
    "two cases are of interest : @xmath6 so that @xmath40 when diffusion becomes important , and @xmath8 so that @xmath41 at that time .    in the wind , for diffusion over a distance @xmath42 ,",
    "the diffusion time is @xmath43 .",
    "taking @xmath44 and noting @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 , independent of radius ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if the extent of the optically thick region ( to @xmath47 ) is not much beyond @xmath48 , then @xmath49 provides an estimate of the diffusion time for the radiation to escape . the time is longer if @xmath50 .",
    "if the diffusion is assumed to proceed in steps with size @xmath51 , the timescale is increased by a term that is logarithmic in @xmath52 .",
    "for the approximate results presented here , we neglect the logarithmic dependence and take @xmath53    we now examine a specific model for expansion into the dense wind . after the shock wave has expanded beyond the stellar radius , the ejecta tend toward free expansion ( @xmath54 ) in which there is a steep power law section on the outside and a flat profile in the inner region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we make the approximation that @xmath55 at velocities @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58",
    ". the outer profile is less steep than the profile inferred for the asymptotic profile expected at high velocities ; the wind interaction causes a flatter part of the density distribution to be relevant .",
    "we then have @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the interaction between this power law density distribution and a surrounding wind , with density @xmath45 , can be described by a self - similar solution with adiabatic index @xmath62 @xcite , which is appropriate for a radiation dominated gas .",
    "the radius of the contact discontinuity is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath65 ergs , @xmath66 is the ejecta mass in units of @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the age in units of 10 days .",
    "the highest velocities occur just inside the reverse shock wave , where the velocity is @xmath69 .",
    "the applicability of the solution requires that @xmath70 , or @xmath71 .",
    "we initially assume that @xmath72 . at time @xmath73 , @xmath74 the amount of energy in the interaction shell above some velocity @xmath75 is @xmath76 the internal energy , which is in the form of radiation , is @xmath77 @xcite . using @xmath78 at time @xmath73 , we have @xmath79 for the radiative energy in the breakout shell .",
    "the timescale for the radiation to escape is @xmath73 , so the luminosity at shock breakout is @xmath80 taking the radiation energy @xmath81 and the shocked volume of @xmath82 at time @xmath73 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the forward and reverse shock radii , the mean radiation energy density gives a radiation temperature @xmath83 where we have used @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite , and @xmath86 is @xmath73 in units of 10 days .",
    "another estimate of @xmath87 can be obtained from the forward shock condition on the pressure : @xmath88 for a @xmath62 gas , where @xmath89 is the radiation constant ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the temperature coefficient in equation ( [ temp ] ) is 7% higher ; the difference is due to the fact that there is a drop in the pressure behind the forward shock front in the shocked region .",
    "the results assume a smooth wind with an @xmath90 density profile , but the temperature of the breakout shell is not strongly dependent on this assumption .",
    "more generally , if @xmath42 is the size of the breakout region , the optical depth through the region is @xmath91 and the shock crosses the shell in the diffusion time , or @xmath92 . the resulting density @xmath93 , when combined with the shock jump condition for the radiation pressure , gives a temperature comparable to that in equation ( [ temp ] ) .",
    "these results can be compared to the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "taking their model s13w2r20m2e3 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , the breakout radius in our model is @xmath97 cm , which is inside the outer radius of @xmath98 cm in the numerical model .",
    "substituting the parameters into equation ( 5 ) , the radiated energy is @xmath99 ergs , which is close to the @xmath100 ergs found in the numerical model @xcite .",
    "the numerical result may be larger , in part , because the shock wave generates power in the more extended circumstellar medium .",
    "we also examined the scaling of @xmath81 with the parameters and found reasonable agreement with the numerical results .",
    "the scaling depends on the supernova density gradient , which is only approximately treated here .",
    "estimates of the observable color temperature of the radiation require considerations of whether radiation equilibrium is attained in the emitting region .",
    "following @xcite , we define a thermal coupling coefficient @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the photon number density in thermal equilibrium , @xmath103 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath104 s@xmath39 @xmath105 is the production rate of photons by the free - free process . if sufficient photons are produced to maintain the blackbody number density , or @xmath106 , thermal equilibrium is achieved . using equations ( [ td ] ) and ( [ temp ] ) for @xmath73 and @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ( taking into account the factor 7 compression in the shock wave )",
    ", we estimate @xmath109 for the breakout shell : @xmath110 for the standard parameters , the breakout shell is marginally in thermal equilibrium . as the radiation propagates into the unshocked mass loss region , the lower density results in a deviation from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the frequency dependence of the opacity can play a role @xcite and we do not treat the details of spectrum production here .    the loss of radiative energy from the shocked region results in the formation of a dense shell at radius @xmath52 , as seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the shell into additional mass loss produces continuing power for the supernova , @xmath111 , where the wind velocity @xmath20 may be affected by preshock radiative acceleration .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show some evidence for acceleration , but it is only significant near the breakout radius because of the @xmath90 dependence of the radiative flux , and we neglect it here .",
    "the expansion of @xmath52 can be described by the thin shell approximation @xcite , yielding @xmath112 .",
    "the resulting power is @xmath113 the magnitude of the luminosity is similar to that produced by the initial breakout radiation , as is seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the luminosity lasts until the shock wave at @xmath52 reaches the edge of the dense wind , @xmath1 , at @xmath114 yr , where @xmath115 is in units of @xmath116 cm .",
    "1a illustrates the luminosity evolution with the late flattening from the shell interaction .    in the case of shock breakout from a red supergiant",
    ", the shock front takes @xmath117 day to traverse the star and the time for shock breakout is @xmath118 s @xcite .",
    "the shock breakout timescale is much less than the time since explosion . in the dense mass loss case considered here ,",
    "the time for the shock front to move to the breakout region is @xmath7 , which is also the timescale for the breakout event .",
    "this property of the luminosity evolution can be seen in simulations of such events @xcite .",
    "the rise to maximum light can have complications due to variations in the gas opacity . at the high circumstellar densities considered here ,",
    "it is likely that the gas is initially neutral and that most of the opacity is due to dust in the presupernova environment .",
    "the radiation dominated shock wave from the supernova has a precursor in the mass loss region that is expected to heat the circumstellar dust .",
    "as the temperature rises through @xmath119 k , the dust evaporates , giving a decrease in the opacity and the photospheric radius drops to where there is a sharp gradient in the opacity as the gas becomes ionized . in type iip supernovae",
    ", this property of the opacity causes a recombination wave to back into the expanding envelope with a constant photospheric temperature @xmath120 k. here , the process is inverted and the photosphere is expected to follow the ionization wave moving out through the dense circumstellar gas .",
    "this phase of approximately constant temperature can be seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "once the circumstellar mass is ionized , the photospheric expansion slows and the temperature rises .",
    "the light curve rises fairly sharply due to the temperature rise until the maximum temperature , and luminosity , is reached .",
    "we now consider the case that @xmath8 .",
    "the shock breakout process begins at @xmath121 .",
    "the rise time for the light curve is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the distance in from @xmath1 across which the diffusion time equals the shock crossing time .",
    "we thus have @xmath124 , leading to @xmath125 . in this case",
    "the rise time can be considerably shorter that the time for initial heating of the envelope ( fig .",
    "1b ) . since @xmath126 , the region",
    "involved in shock breakout is not radially extended , so the pressure of the escaping radiation can accelerate the gas out to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "high gas velocities are expected around the time of maximum luminosity .",
    "a dense shell forms when the radiation can escape , but does not produce continuing high luminosity because the dense gas does not extend far beyond the breakout point and it has been radiatively accelerated .    for our specific supernova model , the shock breakout begins when the forward shock ( @xmath29 ) reaches @xmath1 , which occurs at @xmath127 days , where @xmath128 is @xmath1 in units of @xmath129 cm .",
    "the free expansion velocity at the reverse shock is @xmath130 , which leads to a radiated energy of @xmath131 e_{51}m_{e1}^{-0.5}d_*^{0.5}$ ] ergs .",
    "the rise time for the light curve is @xmath132 m_{e1}^{0.45}d_*^{-0.35}$ ] days , so that @xmath133 .",
    "the temperature in the shocked shell is like that given in the first part of equation ( [ temp ] ) except that @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath134 .",
    "the temperature is lowered in the escape out to the photosphere if there is sufficient photon production in this region @xcite .",
    "the radiated energy from sn 2006gy from the initial optical rise to around the peak is @xmath135 ergs @xcite , which makes it a good candidate for the physical situation described here ( with wind optical depth @xmath28 ) . in this case",
    ", the observed rise time gives an estimate of @xmath73 , the diffusion time .",
    "the observations indicate a rise time of 60 days . using equation ( [ td ] ) , the indicated wind density is @xmath136 .",
    "the observed peak luminosity has sensitivity to the supernova energy . at maximum light",
    "the observed luminosity was @xmath137 @xcite , which implies @xmath138 for the other standard parameters . with these parameters , equation ( [ rd ] ) gives @xmath139 cm while the dense medium may extend to @xmath140 cm @xcite , so that @xmath6 .",
    "we attribute the flattening of the observed light curve @xcite to the continuing interaction in the extended region . with @xmath141",
    "cm the implied circumstellar mass is @xmath142 .",
    "these parameters are close to those found by @xcite and @xcite , which is expected because the basic physical picture is similar in the two cases .",
    "depending on the ejecta mass , the condition that @xmath70 may be violated , but we do not expect the results to be strongly affected .",
    "@xcite estimated an explosion date of 20 august , 2006 for sn 2006gy ; this time is just before the beginning of a rise in optical luminosity from @xmath143 to @xmath144 , where @xmath144 is the maximum optical luminosity . in the shock breakout view , the sharp rise of optical radiation occurs after a time @xmath145 during which the shock is traveling in the optically thick region ( fig .",
    "the explosion date is thus @xmath146 days earlier than the estimate of @xcite , and mean velocities of uniformly expanding ejecta are lower than the estimates of smith et al .",
    "another aspect of the rise to maximum in shock breakout is that the increasing temperature as the shock breaks out is an important component of the rising luminosity . in the case of sn 2006gy , @xcite",
    "find a temperature @xmath147 k on days 65 and 71 ( from aug 20 , 2006 ) ( their fig .",
    "4 ) , which is close to the time of optical maximum light . on day 36 ,",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath148 k , using the same extinction value as that used for other epochs ( their fig .",
    "4 ) . however , they find that with an assumed larger extinction , a photosphere with @xmath149 k provides a better fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "the higher temperature would bring the temperature evolution more in line with that observed in other supernovae , i.e. a decreasing temperature with time , and is advocated by @xcite .",
    "however , in the shock breakout view , the increasing temperature is expected and there is no need for a time dependent extinction . in our model ,",
    "the dense shell and shock wave are deep within the circumstellar envelope , outside of which is the last equilibrium shell where the spectrum is formed .",
    "the radius of this shell is not the blackbody radius @xmath150 because of the nonequilibrium conditions in the medium .",
    "outside of the shell is an electron scattering region of moderate optical depth ( between @xmath151 and 1 ) where the peaked h@xmath152 profile with a broad base can be formed @xcite ; the broadening is due to scattering in the thermal gas as opposed to the doppler effect .",
    "an example of a different type of luminous supernova is sn 2010gx and related objects @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is a sharp drop from peak luminosity without a flattening , broad lines of o ii are present at maximum light , and the narrow h or he lines often observed in type iin supernovae are not present .",
    "the evidence points to an explosion in a more compact circumstellar medium for this class of objects .",
    "the rise time , @xmath153 days , and peak luminosity , @xmath154 , are comparable to the case of sn 2006gy , while the temperature is higher , @xmath155 k. the rise time suggests that @xmath1 is not much less than @xmath48 , so @xmath156 .",
    "the density is comparable to sn 2006gy .",
    "the higher temperature in this case can be attributed to the lower opacity due to the lack of h and he , and the smaller extent of the opaque circumstellar medium .",
    "although the case for dense mass loss years before the supernova appears good , the cause of the mass loss is not known .",
    "@xcite suggested that sn 2006gy was the result of pair instability eruption before the supernova .",
    "since the radiated energy produced in this case is @xmath157 ergs and the radiated energy in observed luminous supernovae is @xmath158 ergs , we have not specifically treated that case here , although if the energy were larger similar physical arguments would presumably apply .",
    "the dense mass loss is typically attributed to lbv ( luminous blue variable ) eruptions @xcite , although such eruptions are not understood in the context of stellar evolution .",
    "an eruption was observed 2 years before the explosion of sn 2006jc , which was a h - poor , type ib supernova @xcite .",
    "the mass loss in this case was too weak to produce the high density phenomena discussed here , but it does show the possibility of a presupernova outburst , even in the h - poor case ."
