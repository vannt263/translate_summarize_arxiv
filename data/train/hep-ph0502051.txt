    "as we will see , the massive @xmath11 field ( named as @xmath1-matter ) behaves like a massive scalar in some respects in its cosmological evolution , due to which the intrinsic anisotropy set by directional @xmath11 field gets diminished eventually .    from the action ( [ act1a ] ) ,",
    "one finds the following equations of motion for the metric @xmath10 and the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath7 @xmath44 @xmath45=0,\\ ] ] @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the equation ( [ a - eq ] ) is also required from the consistency of ( [ b - eq ] ) , as you can easily check by applying @xmath48 to ( [ b - eq ] ) .",
    "out of six equations in ( [ b - eq ] ) , one can find that three of them are dynamical equations and the other three are constraints .",

    "we begin this subsection by turning off the gravitational coupling on the d - brane .",
    "we now consider homogeneous configuration @xmath49 and look for its time evolution in flat spacetime with @xmath50 .",

    "then ( [ foeq ] ) is rewritten by an integral equation @xmath66 the only pattern of nontrivial solutions is oscillating one with amplitude @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",

    "we are interested in the cosmological implications of the large scale fluxes of the antisymmetric tensor field , which might have existed in the early universe .",
    "thus we look for cosmological solutions of ( [ b - eq])([e - eq ] ) with appropriate initial conditions and examine the effects on the cosmological evolution .",
    "first we consider the case that the universe is dominated by the massive tensor field .",
    "extending the above flat spacetime solution , we take into account the homogeneous configurations with an ansatz @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for general non - vanishing @xmath71 , the right - hand side of ( [ e - eq ] )",
    "says that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath72 of antisymmetric tensor field will have non - vanishing off - diagonal components @xmath73 . to consider the simplest form of anisotropic cosmology",
    ", we take only single component of @xmath21 to be nonzero ; namely @xmath74 and @xmath75 . even in this case , @xmath76 in general and thereby the corresponding metric is not isotropic .",

    "let us first consider the limit of @xmath94 which corresponds to either the absence of the brane or the limit of vanishing string coupling @xmath95 , namely the usual massless antisymmetric tensor field . in this limit , the equation ( [ beq ] ) is easily integrated to yield a constant of motion @xmath96 with the vanishing potential",

    "the spacetime evolution with the dilaton rolling in this case was studied in ref .",
    "here we have assumed that the dilaton is stabilized by some mechanism .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce a new time coordinate @xmath98 via the relation @xmath99 . then the equations ( [ 00])([33 ] ) can be written as @xmath100 where the prime denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath98",

    "the evolution of scale factors for large @xmath109 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , with non - vanishing @xmath115 , only @xmath116 grows significantly and the spatial anisotropy develops .",
    "this can be seen clearly by considering the ratio @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "taking @xmath119 and thus @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 which grows as time elapses . finally , we remark that such anisotropy can not be overcome by some other type of isotropic energy density in an expanding universe",
    ". assume the isotropic universe ( @xmath122 ) driven by , e.g , radiation energy density @xmath123 .",
    "then , one finds @xmath124 from ( [ tb ] ) and ( [ l3 ] ) and thus @xmath125 , which implies that the late - time isotropic solution can be realized only in a contracting universe @xcite .",
    "let us now take into consideration the effect of space - filling d - brane . to get sensible solution",
    ", we fine - tune the bulk cosmological constant term to cancel the brane tension , that is @xmath126 , so that the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant vanishes .",
    "it is convenient to define a new variable @xmath127 .",
    "then we can rewrite the full equations as follows @xmath128 @xmath129 with the help of ( [ eeq-11 ] ) , ( [ beq-2 ] ) can be written as @xmath130b=0,\\ ] ] which is valid only for the @xmath1-dominated case , but more convenient for numerical analysis .",
    "here we have put @xmath131 .",
    "first we examine the evolution of @xmath132 and scale factors qualitatively . from ( [ eeq-11])([beq-2 ] ) , we see that the natural time scale is @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the dimensionless time variable .",
    "suppose @xmath135 starts to roll from an initial value @xmath136 , while the universe is isotropic in the sense that @xmath137 .",
    "we assume initially @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 so that @xmath141 and @xmath142 . while @xmath135 is much larger than unity , the rapid expansion of @xmath101 due to the large potential proportional to @xmath143 drives @xmath135 in feedback to drop very quickly to a small value of order one .",
    "our numerical analysis in figure  1 shows that this happens within @xmath144 up to reasonably large value of @xmath136 for which the numerical solution is working .",
    "the behavior of @xmath132 after this point is almost universal irrespective of the initial value @xmath136 if it is much larger than unity .",
    "once @xmath135 becomes smaller than unity , the quadratic term of mass dominates over the expansion and @xmath135 begins to oscillate about @xmath145 .",
    "then the expansion of the universe provides the slow decrease of the oscillation amplitude .",
    "the situation is the same as that of the coherently oscillating scalar field such as the axion or the moduli in the expanding universe . for small @xmath135 ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the oscillating @xmath1 field is given by @xmath146 $ ] where @xmath147 with the expansion of the universe neglected , the equation of motion for @xmath135 is then approximated by @xmath148 since the oscillation is much faster than the expansion , we can use the time - averaged quantities over one period of oscillation for the evolution of spacetime .",
    "the equation ( [ beq - osc ] ) gives the relation @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the oscillating @xmath1 field has the property @xmath150 and behaves like homogeneous and isotropic matter .",
    "this justifies the name of _ b - matter_. therefore , after @xmath135 begins to oscillate , the isotropy of the universe is recovered .    to quantify how the universe recovers isotropy ,",
    "let us define the parameter @xmath151 when @xmath152 , the evolution of the quantity @xmath153 is determined by @xmath154 where @xmath155 . at late time ,",
    "the equation ( [ ani ] ) is approximated as @xmath156 and thus one finds @xmath157 .",
    "since @xmath31 is also proportional to @xmath158 , the initial and final anisotropy @xmath159 follow the relation @xmath160 where @xmath161 denotes the initial and final hubble parameter , respectively .",
    "to get an idea of how fast the anisotropy disappears , let us consider @xmath162 gev which corresponds to the hubble parameter at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale of temperature , @xmath163 gev . taking the initial condition @xmath164 around the beginning of the @xmath1 oscillation @xmath165",
    ", we find that the final anisotropy can be completely neglected for reasonable value of @xmath166 .    for @xmath167 with @xmath168 and @xmath169",
    ", the asymptotic solution of ( [ eeq-11])([beq-2 ] ) can be explicitly found to yield @xmath170 which shows the usual matter - like evolution .",
    "that is , the total energy density of the @xmath1-matter diminishes like @xmath171 even though the amplitude @xmath83 itself grows like @xmath172 .",
    "our qualitative results can be confirmed by solving the equations ( [ eeq-1 ] ) , ( [ eeq-3 ] ) , and ( [ beq-3 ] ) numerically .",
    "figure  1 shows the numerical solutions for the initial value @xmath173 . for the large value of @xmath136",
    ", @xmath174 grows very fast while @xmath116 is frozen until @xmath135 becomes smaller than unity .",
    "then @xmath135 begins to oscillate and the universe becomes isotropic again in that the expansion rates , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , converge and finally the universe becomes @xmath1-matter dominated .    .",

    "neglecting @xmath188 term , we have the solution @xmath189 , corresponding to a frozen @xmath1 field at some value @xmath190 , while its energy density decreases exponentially during inflation .",
