    "the interaction between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and their environment has been increasingly studied as a plausible explanation of several long standing problems in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "hierarchal structure formation , first formalized by @xcite , predicts a halo mass function that does not match the shape of the observed galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "simulations predict an overabundance of massive and dwarf galaxies when compared to the observable universe @xcite .",
    "another conflict between observation and theory is that galaxies are primarily red , early types with little star formation or actively star forming blue , late - types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this bimodality requires abrupt truncation of star formation .",
    "most conspicuously , the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) of some clusters is at odds with simple radiative cooling arguments @xcite .",
    "the explanation of all of these problems favors regulation of galaxy evolution by an unknown mechanism of agn ` feedback ' .",
    "the strongest case for the existence of agn feedback can be made in the cores of galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "clusters have long been known as strong x - ray sources @xcite , emitting thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from their hot gas ( first proposed and confirmed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "calculations of the gas cooling time in some clusters showed that it was less than the hubble time @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite and @xcite developed steady - state `` cooling flow '' models in which the gas of these systems condenses towards the center of the potential well .",
    "two major problems with the cooling flow scenario have surfaced : ( 1 ) there have been no observations of the large star formation rate necessary for the center of clusters to be mass sinks of the condensing gas @xcite and ( 2 ) high resolution x - ray observations confirm that cluster centers have far less gas below @xmath3 kev than predicted @xcite . as evidence mounts that gas in these systems do not exhibit strong cooling flows , they have recently been renamed `` cool core '' clusters @xcite .    while cooling flows have been discounted , galaxies exist , so baryons must cool .",
    "removing radiative cooling in the intracluster medium ( icm ) produces the wrong slope of the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . to resolve these discrepancies , radiative cooling",
    "must be balanced , at least in part , by some heating source .",
    "initially , feedback from supernovae was thought to heat the icm , however , it is now assumed that only agn could produce the enormous energy needed to combat cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early evidence for an agn connection came from cross correlating cluster samples with radio sources @xcite .",
    "subsequent study by @xcite found that more than @xmath5 of cluster dominant galaxies in cool core clusters are luminous radio galaxies .",
    "this radio - x - ray correlation led to growing interest in the possibility of agn feedback manifested as icm heating via radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    spectacular support of agn feedback on the icm came from the observations of large x - ray cavities in the gas surrounding group and cluster cores spatially coincident with the radio lobes of jets @xcite .",
    "the prototype of radio mode feedback in clusters is now the set of extremely deep _ chandra _ observations of perseus , which show large cavities in the gas near the cluster core and evidence for shocks , ripples , and sound waves in the icm @xcite .",
    "observations of cygnus a also exhibit clear interactions between the central radio source and the hot gas in this group of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "icm heating via radio mode feedback would eliminate the need for a central mass sink and create the `` entropy floors '' seen in clusters @xcite , producing the observed @xmath4 slope @xcite .",
    "most convincingly , the amount of energy necessary to heat the icm is consistent with the energy needed to physically create the cavities in many systems @xcite .",
    "agn feedback probably occurs over a broad range of energies and efficiencies : the sizes of a few radio cavities suggest that their creation is not sufficient to completely balance radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "the actual heating mechanism employed by radio lobes is still under intense investigation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the timescale of agn feedback is unknown yet fundamental to understanding its underlying physics and to model icm evolution and the accretion history of agn .",
    "several different methods have been introduced to estimate the agn feedback lifetime via the radio emission of lobes or x - ray observations of the icm .",
    "@xcite assumed that radio cavities move at the sound speed of the ambient medium and calculate their age using their projected distance from the galaxy core .",
    "the time necessary for cavities to buoyantly rise to their present position can provide an estimate of their lifetime as well @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined cavity age using the time required to refill the volume of icm displaced by the rising bubbles .",
    "cavity ages between @xmath6 and @xmath7 years have been recorded using these techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , some of these age estimates apply to the current agn age , or the time since the agn turned off .",
    "the analysis herein estimates the average total lifetime of frii sources and consequently the timescale of their agn energy injection .",
    "this energetic agn lifetime is critical to determining the physical processes of agn feedback and whether radiative cooling can be balanced by said mechanisms .",
    "radio loud agn are not in every cool core cluster ; thus , if radio - mode feedback is viable , it must be episodic .",
    "@xcite were among the first to describe evolutionary models of the icm .",
    "radiative loses and gravitational forces promote gas infall towards the potential well and provide fuel for the agn .",
    "the agn then forms jets which in turn lead to the creation of lobes that heat the icm and cause a net outflow of gas .",
    "once this fuel supply is removed , the agn can no longer energetically sustain the jet and the newly created cavities then rise buoyantly through the icm . the strongest evidence for episodic heating has been the discovery of `` ghost '' cavities in the outer regions of some clusters coincident with weaker radio emission no longer directly associated with the agn @xcite .",
    "the preponderance of evidence supporting a connection between galaxy evolution and agn has led to the assumption that black hole growth regulates star formation @xcite .",
    "agn feedback provides a natural regulation mechanism : the energy injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) prevents large scale star formation and provides an upper limit to the stellar mass of the galaxy , contributing to galaxy downsizing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to better understand the consequences of agn feedback , hydrodynamic models have begun detailing the heating affect of radio lobes in the group and cluster environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hierarchal structure formation models now routinely invoke agn feedback to obtain the observed shape of the galaxy luminosity function and bimodal galaxy distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the nature of the physical process that couples the radio source to the icm , the two main sources of uncertainty in the aforementioned models are the efficiency of energy injection and again , the timescales over which the process occurs .",
    "we focus on the latter unknown to provide context for the consequences of agn feedback and its role in galaxy evolution .",
    "some new insights into the details of the dynamics of radio lobes and how they transfer energy to the surrounding medium can be gained from high - resolution observations of individual sources .",
    "multicomponent radio sources are usually divided into one of two morphological classes : fanaroff and riley class i and ii @xcite .",
    "fri sources are dominated by emission towards the nucleus with a gradient towards fainter and more diffuse emission as one moves radially outward .",
    "friis are limb brightened sources , with well defined areas of brightest emission ( `` hotspots '' ) in their outermost regions .",
    "in addition to their morphological distinction , friis are generally more luminous than fris @xcite while the most powerful friis usually show a strong agn component in their spectra indicative of obscured quasars @xcite .",
    "fr class may also be a function of environment as the majority of extended radio sources in clusters are fris @xcite .",
    "fri sources may be friis that encountered high density environments as they arise from turbulent disruption of their lobes and entrainment of ambient gas .",
    "two morphological groups within the fri distinction , narrow angle tails ( nats ) and wide angle tails ( wats ) , are the result of radio source interaction with the icm in dense cluster and group environments , either displaced due to galactic motion relative to the ambient medium @xcite or bulk motions in the icm @xcite .",
    "both fri and frii sources have been observed interacting with the surrounding medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the well defined structure of friis is an astrophysical analog of a supersonic , collimated flow into ambient gas @xcite .",
    "long identified as the collision site of the energetic jet particles and the surrounding medium , the hotspot position of frii sources has been used as a standard measuring stick of the spatial extent of these powerful radio sources and can potentially reveal source age .",
    "asymmetries in the length of classic double lobed sources due to light travel time have been used to estimate their expansion speed @xcite .",
    "high resolution measurements of these geometric asymmetries estimate the hot spot advance speed to be @xmath8 throughout the jet s lifetime @xcite",
    ". the radiative properties of radio lobes can provide estimates of the hotspot advance speed and source age as well .",
    "radiating particles advect away from the hotspot and fill the cocoon , losing energy and softening the radio spectrum of the source as a function of age @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of cygnus a show that the spectral index is a strong function of radial distance from the agn @xcite ; this is seen in other frii sources as well .",
    "recent spectral age estimates of friis are between @xmath9 and @xmath10 years ( odea 2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "shared characteristics of frii sources led to the idea of self - similar growth @xcite .",
    "in addition to similar advance speeds , similar axial ratios ( @xmath11 , the ratio of a lobe s length to width ) were recorded for frii sources over a wide range of linear sizes @xcite . according to the basic model for frii growth , an agn gives rise to two jets that propagate in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the energetic jet terminates in a shock , forming the hotspot , and drives a bow shock into the ambient medium .",
    "this accepted foundation has been built on by a number of models that analytically describe the dynamics of frii sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ka ) and their luminosity evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kda , brw , mk , respectively ) .",
    "all three use the dimensional arguments of ka to determine the length of frii sources as a function of age but differ on how energy is deposited in the radio lobes from the hotspot . given the physical properties of the jet and its ambient environment , each model predicts the track of sources in the luminosity - size plane .",
    "we use the kda model as the crucial link between the intrinsic and observable characteristics of friis . while the physics of radio jets are not completely understood in detail , these models of frii source evolution produce results consistent with the demographics of large radio surveys @xcite .",
    "demographic studies of radio mode feedback have been greatly assisted by the recent completion of large area optical and radio sky surveys . in particular , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , covering two fifths of the northern galactic sky down to an @xmath12-band limiting magnitude of @xmath13 , has proved invaluable in determining where potential radio mode feedback systems ( groups and clusters ) are on the sky .",
    "several systematic searches for clusters and groups using photometric ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectroscopic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data have provided valuable catalogs for a plethora of research .",
    "the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( * ? ? ?",

    "* first ) survey is the radio analog to sdss . surveying the sdss area down to 1 mjy at 1.4 ghz , first represents a substantial improvement in radio surveys with regards to sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "other radio surveys , especially the nrao vla sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nvss ) , and first constitute an expansive and detailed picture of the radio universe .",
    "the combination of these optical and radio resources provides unparalleled opportunity to investigate the radio properties of the richest systems in the universe .",
    "in addition to our frii lifetime estimate , we present a demographic study of radio sources in low redshift central group galaxies .",
    "one of the first investigations from these large area surveys has been the measurement of the radio galaxy lf and its deviations from the optical galaxy lf @xcite .",
    "correlations between radio active agn and host galaxy properties , including local density and luminosity , have strengthened the arguments for radio mode feedback @xcite .",
    "in addition , a higher fraction of radio loud agn are found in galaxies at the center of clusters compared to similar galaxies not at the center of their cluster s potential well @xcite .",
    "demographic studies have provided good evidence that radio mode feedback is a factor in galaxy evolution and even regulation .    in the present study",
    "we produce a sample of frii radio sources associated with central group galaxies using optical data from the sdss and radio maps from first to measure the maximum lifetime of friis .",
    "our systematic search for and subsequent analysis of friis measures their typical energetic lifetime a fundamental parameter necessary to ascertain the nature of agn feedback and its ramifications .",
    "the properties of the host galaxy are assembled from our optical data while the source attributes are obtained from our radio data .",
    "we ultimately produce a collection of frii radio sources and measure their projected lengths ( section  [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "simulations of frii sources with known properties are produced in a monte carlo scheme using the kda model and compared to our observed sample in section  [ sec : popgen ] . in section  [ sec : res ] we present our results for the lifetime of frii sources , while dependence upon group and host galaxy properties is discussed in section  [ sec : res_clustering ] .",

    "sdss scans the sky in five photometric bandpasses simultaneously with its @xmath15 megapixel camera @xcite . except in the case of fiber collisions owing to very small angular separations on the sky ,",
    "most galaxies in the survey are selected for spectroscopic follow up .",
    "@xcite use a redshift space friends of friends ( fof ) algorithm to identify groups of galaxies within the sample14 galaxy set @xcite ; itself a subset of the main sdss galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "fof identification schemes are based on the premise of recursively linking galaxies together within a specified linking volume around each galaxy .",
    "the specific details can be found in @xcite and sources cited therein .",
    "fof algorithms have several advantages : they produce unique groups of galaxies for a given linking volume , no group geometry ( e.g.  spherical ) need be assumed a priori , and groups are only supplemented with new members when the linking volume is increased .",

    ", it is much less likely to resolve out any flux from sources .      to create a manageable sample size , groups with total m@xmath22 mag",

    "fr morphology can be robustly detected when the source is @xmath29 ( corresponding to the minimum first component size plus the approximate half power beam width of first ) and we require this minimum length of any potential frii . we find 32 central galaxies whose associated radio sources meet this simple criteria . any fri interlopers are removed from the sample via the morphological distinction made by @xcite , i.e. , if the `` ratio of the distance between the regions of highest brightness of opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar to the total extent of the source '' was greater than 0.5 , the source is an frii @xcite .",

    "the mean @xmath31 of the host galaxies in our sample is -21.82 , corresponding to an fri / frii break luminosity of @xmath32 w hz@xmath26 at @xmath33 for our choice of cosmology ( 20 sources do not exceed this threshold in our sample , of which 9 are within a factor of @xmath34 ) .",
    "we note that studies of fr sources have been dominated by high luminosity sources due to the relative lack of sensitivity in wide - area radio surveys until recent years . @xcite",
    "argue that morphology is a much more fundamental quantity than luminosity as similarly luminous sources will not have the same jet properties at all redshifts . our sample is strictly composed of friis in the morphological sense .",

    "we assumed that the centroid of the bright , compact emission in each lobe was the position of the hotspot ( as in @xcite ) .",

    "in addition , we expect at least one convincing fake frii source ( greater than @xmath38 separation between two random sources with projected length asymmetry less than 15 kpc ) at greater distances due to the surface density of first sources .",

    "the next ingredient in our mock catalogs is a prescription for radio source evolution in time .",
    "as noted above , three models for frii source evolution are commonly discussed in the literature : kda , brw , and mk .",
    "most of these models only differ in their calculation of the luminosity , whereas the equations governing the length of the radio source as a function of age simply stem from a dimensional argument found in ka . @xcite",
    "quantitatively compared these models and their ability to reproduce established radio surveys results , particularly the friis in the third cambridge revised revised ( 3crr ) , sixth cambridge ( 6cr ) , and seventh cambridge redshift surveys ( 7crs ) .",
    "these authors created mock catalogs ( using a similar scheme to this paper ) to emulate these surveys and evaluated each model with 1d and 2d kolmogorov - smirnov tests between the real and modeled data across several parameters ( luminosity , linear size , and spectral index ) .",
    "they concluded that while all of the models required modification to produce the proper distribution of spectral index , the kda model produced simulated data that most closely matched the observed surveys , especially in the luminosity - linear size plane most relevant to our investigation .",
    "based on @xcite , we use kda to model the luminosity evolution of friis in our mock catalogs .",
    "while we chose the kda model based on its agreement with existing data , all the models mentioned produce broadly consistent size - luminosity relationships and therefore our results should not significantly depend upon model choice .",
    "ka and kda also have the virtue of being the simplest self similar models for the length and luminosity of a radio source as a function of age , environment , and jet power .",
    "they are an extension of canonical models in which a jet emerges from the agn region and is soon confined by the uniform pressure of the surrounding cocoon except near the hotspot . the ram pressure of the jet is distributed over the working surface and is balanced by the ambient shocked igm .",
    "ka introduce the dynamics of the cocoon while kda calculate evolutionary tracks for radio sources in the luminosity - linear size plane .",
    "below we quickly summarize the important assumptions and quantities involved in the calculation of source length .",

    ", one can make a dimensional argument that the length of the lobe , @xmath60 , is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a characteristic time scale , @xmath63 is the age of the source , @xmath64 is the initial jet power , and @xmath65 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "the calculation of source luminosity is far more complex but still relies upon the basic assumptions outlined above .",
    "we use eq .",

    "we first address the parameters that remained constant in our analysis and then discuss those that were varied from simulation to simulation .    the adiabatic index of the gaseous igm , cocoon , and magnetic field ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , respectively ) are chosen to represent non - relativistic ( @xmath67 ) or relativistic ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) equations of state i.e.  @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "there are two other plausible scenarios : both the cocoon and the magnetic field are governed by non - relativistic equations of state or the magnetic energy density is proportional to one of the relativistic particles .",
    "neither scenario would significantly change the length calculation .",

    "this higher @xmath78 will produce a greater hotspot advance speed , yielding sources of a given length in a shorter period of time .",

    "kda adopt a nominal value , @xmath11@xmath80 , corresponding to @xmath81 and we do the same .    a dense igm increases the confinement pressure on the lobe and reduces the hotspot advance speed .",
    "we investigate how the density profile of the igm , another input parameter of the kda model , affects lobe length and lifetime measurements in section  [ sec : den ] and determine the relationship between axial ratio and t@xmath0  in section  [ sec : rt ] .",

    "we estimate the lifetime of frii sources with these parameter choices to place constraints on the systematic uncertainties due to the unknown values and distributions of these parameters .",

    "the axial ratio characterizes the shape of the lobe .",
    "more collimated lobes reach longer distances in a shorter amount of time as the area of their hotspot is smaller , allowing the jet s ram pressure to build up faster .",
    "we note that @xmath188 have been found for frii sources @xcite , although @xcite gathered a sample of radio sources from the literature and found axial ratios as high as 7.5 . however , this sample was biased towards the most powerful radio sources known and may not be indicative of typical friis .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath11  is dependent upon @xmath59 while brw and others postulate that axial ratio is a function of jet power .",
    "either scenario would help explain some of the high axial ratios found in @xcite .",
    "as the vast majority of frii sources appear to have axial ratios between 1.0 and 6.0 , we focus our attention on this region of parameter space .",
    "in addition to our default value of @xmath11@xmath80 , we also investigate @xmath11@xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "our @xmath191(t@xmath0 ) for all eight of these parameter choices is shown in figure  [ fig : rt_p ] .",
    "when @xmath11  decreases , the pressure at the hotspot increases as the lobe encounters a higher resistance from the igm due to the increased surface area of the cocoon ( kda ) .",
    "consequently , the hotspot advance speed decreases and we therefore expect the frii lifetime to be inversely related to @xmath11 .",
    "if the lobes are less collimated , sources must be older to reach a given linear size .",
    "we refer the reader to table  [ table : lh ] for our computed values of the frii lifetime for @xmath11  @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "the injection index @xmath73 ( section  [ sec : inpars ] ) is used solely in the calculation of the source luminosity .",
    "we refer the reader to kda for an explanation of the relationship between luminosity and @xmath73 . here , we test the stability of our results against changes in the power law describing the injection of energetic particles into the jet . we have noted that substantial theoretical and observational evidence exists for @xmath194p@xmath195 ( section  [ sec : inpars ] ) . to sample this range , we examine @xmath77 and @xmath196 in addition to our fiducial value of @xmath75 . recall that the lifetime for frii sources under our default conditions ( @xmath75 ) was @xmath176 yrs ( @xmath119 ) and @xmath197 yrs ( @xmath120 ) . upon changing the injection index to 2.5 ( @xmath146 ) , the most likely t@xmath0  is @xmath198 yrs ; @xmath199 ( @xmath150 ) yields a lifetime of @xmath200 yrs ( figure  [ fig : rt_p ] ) . using the blundell jet power distribution , we measure lifetimes of @xmath201 yrs ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath202 yrs ( @xmath151 ) . while variation of @xmath73 should not greatly influence radio luminosity at a given frequency , we have confirmed that changing the value of @xmath73 within the theoretically accepted range produces no significant change in the lifetime estimate .",
    "we assert that our results are pseudo independent of source luminosity due to first s sensitivity at this observing frequency and the expected luminosity range of friis .",
    "unless other models compute source luminosity in drastically different ways , we expect our results to be robust to changes in radio source evolution model .",
    "in particular , as the models of brw and mk are based upon the ka model , use of either of these models should produce no appreciable changes to these results .",
    "we have measured the range of t@xmath0  consistent with our observed sample given the uncertainties in the parameters that characterize the parent population .",
    "estimates of t@xmath0  vary from @xmath203 to @xmath204 yrs . within the accepted range of input parameters described above , the most uncertain variable is @xmath11 .",
    "extreme lobe axial ratios , compared to our fiducial value , produce a factor of 2 change in t@xmath0 .",
    "while one could allow for a distribution in density profile and axial ratio as part of this analysis , we judge that our present sample size is too small to provide meaningful constraints .",
    "instead , we have examined a wide and reasonable range of both density profile and axial ratio .",
    "if distributions ( as yet unquantified by observations ) in these parameters were used instead , the resulting t@xmath0  would be a weighted mean of the results already obtained here . when generally discussing frii lifetime in subsequent sections , we conservatively choose t@xmath0@xmath205 yrs . other choices of @xmath103 do not alter the lifetime by more than @xmath206 compared to those found with @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "in addition to their lifetime , the duty cycle associated with friis is an important timescale . using the @xcite catalog of groups",
    ", we measure the typical time between episodes of frii radio activity in central group galaxies . of the @xmath23",
    "groups studied , @xmath207 central galaxies were host to frii radio sources .",
    "we determine the level of incompleteness from our mock catalogs .",
    "the default simulation with @xmath47  ( @xmath119 ) yielded a lifetime of @xmath208 years .",
    "of the @xmath9 sources in @xmath119 , @xmath209 would have been detected by first and identified as friis .",
    "we therefore estimate that our observed sample of frii sources is @xmath210 complete for sources that follow the quoted model parameters ( e.g.  those with initial jet powers above @xmath211 ) .",
    "sources may not be detected for two reasons : ( 1 ) too young and therefore smaller than the angular resolution of first or our required angular size to be considered an frii and ( 2 ) luminosity corresponds to a flux below first s sensitivity at the source redshift .",
    "we conclude that the incompleteness corrected frii duty cycle is @xmath212 in central group galaxies .",
    "the corresponding average time between frii phases in these central galaxies is @xmath213 years . due to a different completeness level for @xmath54  ( @xmath120 )",
    ", @xmath214 of central galaxies exhibit frii activity using this jet power distribution .",
    "the time between frii phases is thus a factor of 2 higher at @xmath215 years .",
    "we note that there are many fri sources in this group sample as well and consequently the environments of some of these sources may not be amenable to an frii morphology .",
    "this implies the frii duty cycle is actually higher for those group environments suitable for friis .",
    "our attention was initially brought to the berlind group sample @xcite by their subsequent paper on the clustering or bias of groups as a function of various group and central galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to determine if these properties are correlated in any way with radio activity , and whether radio activity is correlated with more clustered systems .",
    "here we quickly outline the results of @xcite and discuss how radio activity varies with a number of the parameters studied therein .",
    "group and central galaxy properties tested for correlations with bias in @xcite were group number richness @xmath216 , group velocity dispersion @xmath217 , total group color ( g - r)@xmath218 , central galaxy color ( g - r)@xmath219 , central galaxy luminosity m@xmath220 , and the magnitude gap between the central galaxy and the second brightest member of the group @xmath161m@xmath221 .",

    "each mass bin was split into `` high '' and `` low '' subsets , based upon the median parameter value in a given mass bin .",

    "our sample of @xmath23 central group galaxies is comprised of the most luminous groups in the berlind catalog .",

    "our prototype for the average state of frii lobes and surrounding medium is listed in table  [ table : lh ] ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "we stress that our sample is representative of the group environment and as such our lifetime estimate is for a typical frii source in these systems .",

    "we numerically investigated the dependence of any single input parameter and t@xmath0 , while we present an analytic treatment in the appendix .",

    "mock radio sources were expanded into three distinct igms .",
    "in addition to the kda density profile , the less dense profile of the brw model and a recent observational measurement by @xcite were tested .",

    ", the density profile of the igm in galaxy groups spans some distribution whose shape will contribute to a range of expansion speeds for frii sources .",
    "the work here demonstrates that t@xmath0  is a weak function of environment and will likely vary by less than @xmath255 .",
    "we find that the axial ratio of the lobe had the largest effect on the calculated lifetime of our observed sample .",
    "still , the calculated lifetime of extreme axial ratio lobes was not different from our fiducial results by more than a factor of @xmath256 .",
    "we sample the entire range of expected axial ratio and find t@xmath0  in the range of @xmath257 years ( @xmath47 ) . due to the sensitivity of first and the relatively small distance to the groups in this study , uncertainties in the particle energy distribution",
    "do not effect our results .",
    "we created mock catalogs that only differed in the choice of the injection index @xmath73 and found t@xmath0  was statistically identical over the entire probable range .",
    "the values and associated uncertainties of parameters solely contributing to the luminosity of the sources are insignificant in this analysis .    taken together , these tests on the parametric dependence of t@xmath0  demonstrate how robust our results are to ambiguity in the true distributions of many jet , lobe , and environmental parameters .",
    "due to the self - similar nature of the length to age relationship determined in ka , these results would not change appreciably if another radio source evolution model was incorporated into our analysis . while individual extreme sources may be observed with ages significantly larger than the maximum lifetime found here ,",
    "the vast majority of frii sources reside within the parameter space examined .",
    "we therefore conclude that the average frii lifetime is @xmath258 years .",
    "this characteristic maximum lifetime of the frii population is in good agreement with various methods of radio source dating for individual objects .",
    "recently , odea ( 2007 , in prep . ) used spectral aging to estimate the source ages of 31 powerful frii radio galaxies . under minimum energy conditions ,",
    "all source ages were less than @xmath259 years while most were several myr old .",
    "@xcite presented a comprehensive study of luminous elliptical galaxies , measuring the age of ( primarily fri ) radio sources still energetically associated with their parent agn .",

    "the maximum lifetime of @xmath260 years for friis is also in good agreement with observational constraints on the lifetime of qsos , which suggest values from @xmath9 to @xmath116 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the value of the e - folding or salpeter timescale for black hole growth at the eddington rate @xmath261 yr ( for 10% radiative efficiency ) .",
    "this is most likely a coincidence , because these friis show little evidence of nuclear activity in their sdss spectra , are consequently accreting at a low rate , and also show no evidence that they have been triggered by mergers .",
    "in fact the detailed models of agn triggered in major mergers find that the lifetime is progressively longer when the agn is defined at a progressively lower luminosity or accretion rate limit @xcite . at the accretion rates of these friis ,",
    "the predicted lifetime would be substantially longer than @xmath10 years in the merger scenario .",
    "we investigated the connection between host galaxy and group properties and the probability of harboring a radio source .",
    "the size of a group correlates with @xmath228  at the @xmath262 level .",
    "assuming some average galactic mass , group size should be proportional to its viral radius .",
    "it is plausible that larger viral radii would encapsulate greater gas mass on average .",
    "if agn feedback regulates star formation , larger systems would need shorter duty cycles or longer lifetimes of feedback activity to counteract their stronger cooling flows .",
    "the increase in @xmath228  with group size supports the idea of episodic agn heating .",
    "the luminosity of the host galaxy is the strongest predictor of radio activity . comparing galaxies with @xmath263 ,",
    "the radio fraction increased with luminosity by at least a factor of @xmath35 at the greater than @xmath264 level depending on the criterion used to determine the radio source activity threshold .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous studies of radio - loud agn in bcgs @xcite .",
    "our combined results point toward galaxy luminosity being the most important indicator of radio activity over a large range group / cluster mass . a slightly weaker correlation ( @xmath265 ) between host galaxy color and @xmath228",
    "was also found .",
    "redder galaxies have an increased probability of harboring radio sources .",
    "interestingly , galaxy color was found to be anti - correlated with clustering bias recently in the literature @xcite .",
    "the two results suggest no connection between radio fraction and bias .    the luminosity gap between the brightest and second brightest group or cluster member has been discussed as a measure of certainty regarding central galaxy identification . the maxbcg catalog and that of @xcite both designate the brightest cluster ( group ) member as the central galaxy .",
    "a caveat of this technique is uncertainty in the central galaxy s position with respect to the center of the group or cluster s potential well .",
    "as @xmath227 increases , the position - luminosity relationship tightens @xcite .",
    "we find a significant correlation between @xmath228  and @xmath227 , which may be due in part to misdiagnosis of the central galaxy or that this galaxy is not at the center of the group potential .",
    "@xcite examined the radio loud agn fraction of bcg galaxies , finding an increased likelihood of radio source association when compared to field galaxies .",
    "the discrepancy in radio fraction between central and field galaxies may increase if the possible misclassification of central galaxies is taken into account .",
    "this potential source of incompleteness associated with all central galaxy studies should be addressed in future analysis .",
    "our results have important implications for agn feedback models .",
    "the recent literature includes many models for agn energy injection into the icm and its subsequent effects on galaxies and hot , gaseous halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "heating from agn is now included in many structure formation models to match the observed galactic lf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the frii lifetime presented here is an accurately measured timescale over which jets are energetically sustained by agn and perform work on the icm .",
    "many models use an instantaneous injection of energy into the icm as the timescales involved have historically had order of magnitude uncertainty . while it is true that fris are far more numerous than friis , there is increasing evidence of friis and fris being the manifestation of the _ same _ underlying jet mechanism in different environments . a dramatic empirical demonstration of this are the hybrid morphology sources ( hymors ) in which one lobe of a double source appears to be an frii while the other exhibits fri characteristics @xcite .",
    "if fr morphology is a function of environment , it is reasonable to assume both classes share the same lifetime .",
    "we have shown the lifetime of frii sources to be @xmath266 years in a wide range of initial conditions and it is most accurate to inject energy over this timescale .",
    "we would like to thank chris odea for his helpful suggestions and scott gaudi for illuminating discussion .",
    "we also appreciate a thorough and helpful referee s report , which has significantly improved this paper .",
    "funding for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and sdss - ii has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national science foundation , the u.s .",

    "the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/. this research makes use of the first and nvss radio surveys .",
    "here we derive the analytic dependence of t@xmath0  on the other kda model parameters . by plugging eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] into eq .",
    "[ eq : length ] we obtain the full equation for the length of a lobe in terms of the parameters discussed in section  [ sec : kda ] : @xmath267 where @xmath268 is just @xmath65 from eq .",
    "[ eq : length ] and eq .  4 ( kda ) , but shows that it is dependent upon @xmath59 and @xmath11  ( see eq .  25 of kda for the definition ) .",
    "we can easily manipulate this equation to solve for the age of the source , @xmath63 . to zeroth order",
    ", we are trying to determine t@xmath0  such that a source at the average age @xmath269 has the median lobe length @xmath270 . hence setting @xmath271 and @xmath272 we find",
    "@xmath273 note that @xmath274 and therefore @xmath275 only weakly depends on the density distribution , @xmath276 , and is independent of @xmath73 .",
    "we first compare two different density distributions with @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , respectively .",
    "the distribution of jet powers is kept constant ( either sadler or brw ) . in this case",
    "the two maximum ages are related by @xmath283 assigning the kda density profile ( @xmath167 ) to @xmath284 ; the density profile from @xcite ( @xmath169 ) to @xmath285 ; and letting @xmath286 kpc ( @xmath119 ) and @xmath287 kpc ( @xmath129 ) , we find @xmath288 / @xmath289 and with a similar analysis @xmath290 / @xmath291 .",
    "these results are virtually identical to those found in our statistical approach , namely @xmath292 and @xmath293 . similarly , analytically comparing the kda and brw density profiles , @xmath288 / @xmath294 and @xmath290 / @xmath295 while @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "to isolate the effect on t@xmath0  by the choice of jet power distribution , we hold the density profile and axial ratio of the lobes fixed . in this case , the ratio of t@xmath0  simply becomes a function of the @xmath44 distributions : @xmath298    taking the median value of each @xmath44 distribution as a representative jet power and @xmath270 from our mock catalogs , we find @xmath299 .",
    "again , this analytical result is in excellent agreement with the simulation derived @xmath300 .",
    "notice that the statistically obtained ratio of @xmath47  to @xmath54  across all parameter choices in table  [ table : lh ] are between @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "a similar analysis for @xmath303 reveals that the theoretically and practically obtained ratios are in very good agreement .",
    "an increase in the median of the @xmath44 distribution by a factor of @xmath304 ( from @xmath54  to @xmath47 ) decreases t@xmath0  by only a factor of @xmath305 .",
    "finally , we examine the relationship between axial ratio and t@xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath65 and @xmath270 are the only terms in equation  [ eq : time ] that depend upon @xmath11 , the ratio of lifetimes derived from two models that only differ in their choice of @xmath11  is : @xmath306 as an example , we find t@xmath0(@xmath11@xmath80,@xmath47 ) / t@xmath0(@xmath11@xmath307,@xmath47 ) @xmath308 .",
    "this expectation is met very well as the ratio of @xmath119 / @xmath142 @xmath309 .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ eq : rt_dep ] is a good fit to the t@xmath0  distribution resulting from simulations that vary in @xmath11 .",
    "the equations here derive only from the self similar solution for the length of these frii sources ( eq .  [ eq : length ] ) .",
    "this particular equation is a characteristic of all the radio source evolution models discussed in this paper ( ka , kda , brw , mk ) .",
    "we have shown that t@xmath0  is a weakly varying function of the density profile , jet power distribution , and axial ratio .",
