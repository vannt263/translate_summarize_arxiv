    "in the past years much efforts have been made to understand the nature and the origin of dark energy@xmath0 a major puzzle of modern cosmology .",
    "the accumulating observational data continues to confirm that about 70% of the total energy density in the present universe corresponds to unknown energy with a negative pressure @xcite . a wide variety of dark energy models",
    "have been proposed to address this problem @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) . for a viable cosmological evolution",
    "the field energy density should remain sub - dominant during the radiation / matter dominant era and become important only at late times .",
    "though the dynamically evolving scalar - field models have an edge over the cosmological constant scenario , they too , in general , are plagued with fine - tuning problems of initial conditions and parameters of the models .",
    "cosmological scaling solutions , in which matter and dark energy follow the same background evolution , can alleviate the so - called coincidence problem by providing a dynamical attractor @xcite . for a minimally coupled scalar field",
    ", however , the energy density of the field decreases proportionally to that of the background fluid for scaling solutions and hence the acceleration of universe can not be realized .",
    "ordinary dark energy models are then supplemented by additional features tuned to allow the exit from the scaling regime at late times @xcite .",
    "it has , however , been shown that if the coupling between dark energy and dark matter is taken into account , one can achieve an accelerated expansion in the scaling regime , thus alleviating the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to be able to distinguish between scaling and non - scaling solutions observationally .",
    "it is already known that scaling solutions with accelerated expansion give an acceptable fit to the supernovae ( sn ) ia @xcite ; therefore the background behaviour seems to be insufficient in distinguishing between a scaling universe and a non - scaling one .",
    "what is still lacking is the investigation of the evolution of density perturbations in such models , except for specific cases @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to find the perturbation equation in the sub - hubble regime for a very general lagrangian and to solve it along scaling solutions .",
    "our analysis is applied to a wide variety of coupled dark energy models including quintessence , tachyon , dilatonic ghost condensate and k - essence .",
    "we will show that along scaling solutions the equation of matter perturbations can be solved _ analytically _ in terms of observable background quantities ( equation of state and density parameter ) . in particular , the growth rate is found to be unbounded , both from below and from above .",
    "finally , we shall see that when the field behaves as phantom ( equation of state @xmath1 ) then linear matter perturbations are always damped .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ phantom damping_.    the prototype of these stationary solutions is the standard coupled scalar field with an exponential potential @xcite . here , however , the perturbations grow too fast due to the extra attraction induced by the coupling and drive an unacceptable integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . this problem is generally expected in accelerated scaling regimes , both because of the stronger interaction and because the onset of acceleration may occur quite earlier than usual",
    ". an intriguing result in our paper is that the isw effect vanishes for some parameter values .",
    "although these parameters are not observationally acceptable due to current supernovae constraints , this result shows that the problem of an unacceptable isw effect can be alleviated by allowing the phantom field .",
    "we start with the following general lagrangian @xcite @xmath2+{\\mathcal{s}}_{m}[\\phi , g_{\\mu \\nu } ] \\ , , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the kinematic term of a scalar field @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is a scalar field lagrangian which is the function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the action for matter fields which are generally dependent on @xmath4 .",
    "the perturbation equations have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the system of a coupled scalar field . here",
    "we shall study the evolution of matter perturbations for scaling solutions with a general lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "let us consider metric perturbations @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the longitudinal gauge about the flat fridmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a scale factor .",
    "one has @xmath12 in the absence of anisotropic stress .",
    "we shall study a cosmological scenario in which the universe is filled by the field @xmath4 with an energy density @xmath13 and by only one type of matter fluid with an energy density @xmath14 .",
    "we also assume that the field is coupled to matter fluid with a coupling @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 . in the general case",
    "one should insert also radiation and baryons and leave them uncoupled in order not to violate the equivalence principle and other observations . defining the matter density contrast @xmath17 and the dimensionless matter velocity divergence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the hubble rate , we obtain the following perturbation equations in fourier space with wavelength @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath24 . in newtonian limit the perturbation equation for the field @xmath4 takes the following form @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 .",
    "the effective mass @xmath30 is expected to be negligible if the field @xmath4 is responsible for dark energy .",
    "then on sub - hubble scales the @xmath32 term is important , ad its amplitude is forced to balance with the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ dvarphi ] )",
    ". then we find @xmath33 the gravitational potential is expressed as @xcite @xmath34\\,.\\ ] ] since @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath36 on sub - hubble scales , @xmath9 is approximately given by @xmath37 .",
    "then by using eqs .",
    "( [ cdm - n1 ] ) , ( [ cdm - n2 ] ) and ( [ eqphidelta ] ) , we find finally @xmath38 this is a very general equation which holds for any coupled scalar field with lagrangian @xmath31 , even when the coupling @xmath15 depends on the field @xmath4 .",
    "in the general case it can be integrated numerically . in the following",
    "we show that it may be integrated analytically for a scaling cosmology in which the equation of state @xmath39 and the energy ratio @xmath40 are constant",
    ".    in the flat frw background one obtains the following conservation equations @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the equation for @xmath19 is given by @xmath43 where the effective equation of state is defined as @xmath44 .",
    "scaling solutions satisfy the condition @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 . assuming that the coupling @xmath15 is a constant in the scaling regime , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the existence of scaling solutions restricts the form of the scalar field lagrangian to be @xmath47 where @xmath48 is any function in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 for the lagrangian ( [ plag ] ) we find that @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "in what follows we shall specialize the formula to the most relevant case @xmath54 , i.e. , that of cold dark matter . then by using eqs .",
    "( [ lq ] ) and ( [ omew ] ) , the effective equation of state is given by @xmath55 we note that this property holds irrespective of the form of the function @xmath56 .",
    "one has @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the limit @xmath60 .    to discuss the fixed points of our system , it is convenient to introduce two dimensionless quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 , defined by @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ". then the evolution equations ( [ geneeq1 ] ) , ( [ geneeq2 ] ) and ( [ eqhph ] ) for the lagrangian ( [ plag ] ) can be casted in the following autonomous dynamical system : @xmath65\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\left[a(q+\\lambda ) ( g+2g_{1})x^{2}-\\lambda x^{2}-qa\\right],\\label{dx}\\\\ \\hspace*{-0.5em } y ' & = & -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\lambda xy+\\frac{3}{2}y(x^{2}g+1),\\label{dy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the equation of state for the field @xmath4 reads @xmath67 therefore the field behaves as a phantom ( @xmath1 ) for @xmath68 .",
    "the ordinary ( phantom ) scalar field with an exponential potential corresponds to the choice @xmath69 ( negative @xmath70 is a phantom ) .",
    "the dilatonic ghost condensate @xcite and the tachyon @xcite also has scaling solutions , since the lagrangians in these models are written in the form ( [ plag ] ) by the choice @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the critical points can be found by setting @xmath73 in eqs .",
    "( [ dx ] ) and ( [ dy ] ) .",
    "in fact the property of fixed points for coupled systems was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for three classes of dark energy models mentioned above .",
    "there exists the following scaling solution for _ any _ form of the function @xmath56 : @xmath74 as was shown in eq .",
    "( 37 ) in ref .",
    "we note that @xmath75 and that @xmath76 along the scaling solution .",
    "one can easily check that this solution actually satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ dx ] ) and ( [ dy ] ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath77 ( and @xmath78 ) remains undetermined and depends on the specific lagrangian .    for the scaling solution ( [ scalingx ] ) we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 by eqs .",
    "( [ omew ] ) and ( [ eq : weff ] )",
    ". then one can write the perturbation equation ( [ eq : matter ] ) in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath77 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 observationally , we expect @xmath77 to be in the range 0.6 - 0.8 ( from the complementary matter fraction in clustered objects ) and @xmath81 in the range @xmath84 from comparison with snia @xcite .    since @xmath81 and @xmath77 are constants in the scaling regime , we obtain the following solution @xmath85 where @xmath86 are integration constants and @xmath87\\ , . \\label{power}\\ ] ] one has @xmath88 for a non - phantom scalar field , thus giving @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "therefore @xmath91 ( and @xmath9 ) grows in the scaling regime ( @xmath92 ) .    when @xmath58 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : matter ] ) for constant @xmath81 and @xmath93 is given by eq .",
    "( [ delm ] ) with an index @xmath94\\,.\\ ] ] then we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the matter dominant era with @xmath97 and @xmath98 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : weff ] ) one has @xmath57 in the uncoupled case ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "since @xmath99 in the scaling regime , the index @xmath100 satisfies @xmath101 for uncoupled scaling solutions .",
    "meanwhile the coupling @xmath15 can lead to the index @xmath100 larger than 1 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the contour plot of @xmath100 as the functions of @xmath77 and @xmath81 .",
    "the growth of the perturbations gets unboundedly larger as we approach the border @xmath102 .",
    "the large index @xmath100 obviously gives rise to a strong isw effect on cmb , which is not acceptable .",
    "however we caution that a precise bound on @xmath100 will depend on the specific choice of lagrangian .    in the phantom region corresponding to @xmath103 , we find that @xmath100 are complex with negative real parts for @xmath104 .",
    "therefore the perturbations exhibit damped oscillations in this case . if @xmath105 , @xmath100 are either negative real values or complex values with negative real parts . in any case",
    "the perturbations always decay when the field @xmath4 corresponds to a phantom : we call this phenomenon _ phantom damping_. in other words , the repulsive effect of the phantom coupling dissipates the perturbations ( at least in the linear regime ) .    along this scaling solution",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath106 evolves as @xmath107 .",
    "it can be seen therefore that the potential is constant for @xmath108 , which corresponds to @xmath109/3 $ ] . since @xmath110 we find @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( for instance @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath115 ) .",
    "although these values of @xmath81 are currently excluded by sn observations , it is interesting to observe that there exist scaling solutions for which the gravitational potential is exactly constant .",
    "this shows that , generally speaking , the absence of the isw effect does not imply the absence of dark energy .",
    "we should also mention that values of @xmath116 smaller than @xmath117 are allowed if part of dark matter itself is not coupled , see ref .",
    "@xcite . clearly",
    ", the full investigations of such cases require the numerical integration of the boltzmann equations and it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper we have studied the evolution of sub - hubble linear perturbations in the universe filled with a general scalar field coupled to dark matter .",
    "we analytically derived the solutions for matter perturbations when the background is described by the scaling solution given by eq .",
    "( [ scalingx ] ) . this analysis can be applied to any dark energy models which possess scaling solutions .",
    "the power - law index @xmath118 for perturbations is expressed by the functions of @xmath77 and @xmath81 only .",
    "the evolution of perturbations is neatly divided by the border @xmath102 between the ordinary field and the phantom field .",
    "while the perturbations grow for @xmath119 , they are always suppressed in the phantom case . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the index @xmath100 as the functions of @xmath77 and @xmath81 together with the constraint coming from the snia datasets . in the non - phantom region",
    "the growth of the perturbations gets larger as the parameters approach the border @xmath102 , which would give rise to an unacceptable isw effect .",
    "therefore it is likely that large part of the parameters space in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is excluded from the cmb constraints .",
    "the phantom region allowed by the snia constraint corresponds to the strong suppression with @xmath120 .",
    "it is certainly of interest to place constraints on @xmath77 and @xmath81 using the latest cmb datasets .",
    "this requires a full detailed analysis of the evolution of perturbations for each fourier mode without using the short wavelength approximation , which we leave to future work .",
    "this will provide a powerful way to distinguish between coupled dark energy models and other alternatives .",
