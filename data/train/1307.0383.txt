    "to fulfill the requirement of high - precision quantum gates , teleportation , or state transfer , the aim of quantum state engineering ( qse )  @xcite is to manipulate the system and attain a target state , typically a pure state , at a designed time @xmath0 ; or more ambitiously , to drive the eigenstates of an initial hamiltonian into those of a final hamiltonian  @xcite . to be concrete , for a two - level system",
    ", a passage is constructed through which the system undergoes a transition from an initial state @xmath1 to a final state @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , in an undisturbed way . in a closed - system scenario ,",
    "qse has been considered through time optimal evolution  @xcite and robust protocols of realizing qse have been provided by adiabatic passages  @xcite and by sequential convex programming  @xcite . however , for open systems  @xcite , which are under environmental noise due to the onset of the system - bath dynamics  @xcite , qse is significantly challenged in both theoretical and experimental implementations . indeed , for decohering systems",
    ", there is a competition between the time required for adiabaticity and the decoherence time scales  @xcite , which may limit the applicability of the adiabatic approach  @xcite .",
    "identifying protocols that are both fast and fault - tolerant is therefore an important research direction for quantum information processing and quantum control  @xcite .",
    "a non - adiabatic approach for qse  @xcite , originally defined in the context of closed systems , is the inverse engineering control based on lewis - riesenfeld invariants  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the quantum dynamics is dictated by a dynamical invariant @xmath4 , which is an operator defined through the von neumann equation , @xmath5=0 $ ] ( setting @xmath6 ) . by denoting the instantaneous eigenbasis of @xmath4 as an orthonormal set @xmath7 , the method of quantum control by invariants first considers the initial state @xmath1 to be one of the eigenstates of @xmath4 ,",
    "say @xmath8 , and the target state to be @xmath9 .",
    "the operator @xmath4 is then designed to conveniently interpolate between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in particular , the von neumann equation implies that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the time evolution operator .",
    "then , @xmath11 will satisfy @xmath12 , i.e. a system that is initially prepared in a given eigenlevel of @xmath4 will be kept in the corresponding instantaneous eigenlevel for any time @xmath0 , yielding a non - transitional evolution .",
    "hence , qse by inverse control can be implemented by obtaining a desired evolution operator @xmath11 from @xmath4 , which will give rise in a further step to a time - dependent control hamiltonian able to physically generate the engineered target state @xmath9 at time @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this work is to propose a scheme to investigate qse by inverse control in presence of decoherence .",
    "this strategy is different from the usual techniques of protecting the system against the external environmental noise through fast pulse sequences , such as bang - bang control  @xcite and optimal control  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also distinct from the direct kinematic controllability of open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our framework is the observation that the von neumann equation implies that the density operator @xmath13 is a lewis - riesenfeld invariant by itself .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 satisfies the same equation of motion as @xmath4 , namely , @xmath14=0 $ ] .",

    ". therefore , @xmath13 and @xmath11 are mutually equivalent to each other without considering the lewis - riesenfeld phase  @xcite .",
    "hence , the procedure is firstly to get the dynamics of the system as expressed by the time evolution operator @xmath11 . as a second step ,",
    "we inversely obtain the hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "noise is then introduced through stochastic fluctuations in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "such fluctuations will be identified according to specific quantum channels  @xcite , which are physically defined as some special pipelines intended to carry quantum information through an open quantum system . in particular , we find the conditions in which the rapid and robust state passage or population transfer could be realized and those in which the qse ends up with a mixed state .",
    "we start from a general time evolution operator for a two - level system , @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the vector of pauli operator and @xmath21 denotes a unit vector in space .",
