    "collective phenomena play an important role in heavy - ion collisions , but for a long time it was assumed that , at collision energies much greater than 1  gev / nucleon , only longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric transverse radial flow would survive . during the last few years",
    "the situation has changed qualitatively .",
    "anisotropic , directed as well as elliptic , flow has been observed at the bnl ags  @xcite , and strong indications of elliptic flow at the cern sps  @xcite have been demonstrated .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the effect and model calculations involving anisotropic flow have progressed significantly ; different anisotropic flow patterns have been linked to such phenomena as quark - gluon plasma formation , softening of the equation of state  @xcite , and mean - field effects during the fireball evolution  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate tools for flow studies at high energies have been developed  @xcite .",
    "it was also noticed that anisotropic flow could be important for other measurements , such as two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic flow has become an essential part of the global picture of heavy - ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies  @xcite ; it is considered one of the key tools to elucidate the dynamics of the collision .    in the current paper we present results of the analysis of anisotropic transverse collective flow of identified particles , protons and charged pions , detected in the e877 spectrometer in au + au collisions at a beam momentum of 10.8 and 11.4@xmath0 gev / c .",
    "the data were taken during the 1993 and 1994 ags heavy - ion runs .",
    "using calorimeter data we reconstruct the reaction plane event - by - event , and analyze the particle production with respect to this reaction plane . a similar analysis of charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy flow presented in  @xcite displayed a strong directed flow as well as an elliptic flow with the primary axis in the reaction plane , _",
    "i.e. _ perpendicular to the direction of the `` squeeze - out '' effect observed at lower energies  @xcite . here",
    ", using the e877 spectrometer data , we apply the same procedure to determine the triple differential distributions @xmath1 of identified protons and charged pions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a description of the apparatus we discuss the procedure of the analysis . in the subsequent sections we present first the results of the fourier analysis of azimuthal particle distributions in different rapidity bins and for different centralities of the collision .",
    "these results are , to a large extent , independent of the uncertainties in the spectrometer efficiency and the detector acceptance .",
    "then the results on azimuthal anisotropies and related quantities ( such as the mean transverse momentum projected into the reaction plane @xmath2 ) are discussed .",
    "different flow scenarios are discussed from the point of view of the observed dependence of the flow signal on the transverse momentum @xmath3 of the particle .",
    "we compare our measurements with the evaluation of nucleon and pion flow derived from the measurements of charged particle and transverse energy flow  @xcite , as well as with model predictions ( rqmd versions 1.08 and 2.3  @xcite ) .",
    "the e877 apparatus is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the e877 setup , charged particles , emitted in the forward direction and traversing the collimator ( @xmath4 mrad , @xmath5 mrad ) , are analyzed by a high resolution magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer identifies particles via simultaneous measurements of momentum and velocity .",
    "the momentum of each particle is measured using two drift chambers ( dc2 and dc3 , position resolution about 300  @xmath6 m ) whose pattern recognition is aided by four multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) .",
    "the average momentum resolution is @xmath73% limited by multiple scattering .",
    "a time - of - flight hodoscope ( tofu ) located behind the tracking chambers provides the time - of - flight with a typical resolution of 85  ps .",
    "the spectrometer acceptance covers mostly the forward rapidity region with transverse momentum coverage including @xmath8 .",
    "further discussion of the acceptance for different particle species can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a clean particle identification is particularly crucial for the study of flow since the extracted signal may be different for different particle species both in magnitude and in sign .",
    "a small admixture in the particle sample of other particle species could therefore heavily bias the final results .",
    "consequently , in the current analysis , strict requirements are applied for particle identification . using the measured momentum and velocity of the particle we calculate the particle mass . in a plot of momentum _ vs. _ the square of the particle mass @xmath9 we select entries in the region of @xmath10 around the @xmath9 peak of the particle under study and reject all entries within a @xmath11 region of another particle species . here",
    ", @xmath12 represents the standard deviation of the ( gaussian ) mass - squared distribution at a given particle momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the determination of the centrality of the collision and of the reaction plane orientation are made using the transverse energy flow measured in the target calorimeter ( tcal ) , and participant calorimeter ( pcal ) .",
    "both calorimeters have @xmath14 azimuthal coverage and , combined together , they provide nearly complete polar angle coverage as viewed from the nucleus - nucleus center of mass system : tcal and pcal cover the pseudorapidity regions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively  @xcite . the pseudo - rapidity @xmath17 = - ln tan(@xmath18 )",
    "is defined in terms of the polar angle @xmath19 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the structure of the analysis is very similar to that used in @xcite , and many details can be found there . here",
    ", the distributions @xmath20 of identified protons and charged pions are generated in a coordinate system where the @xmath21- and @xmath22-axes span the reaction plane .",
    "the azimuthal angle in this system is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the reaction plane angle , measured for every event using the direction of the transverse energy flow in tcal and pcal , and @xmath25 is the azimuthal angle of an individual particle in the laboratory frame .",
    "the @xmath21-axis is defined in such a way that it points in the direction of the transverse energy flow at forward rapidities .",
    "the transverse momentum components @xmath26 and @xmath27 of identified particles are evaluated in this coordinate system , and the particle distributions with respect to the reaction plane are constructed .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production is studied by means of fourier analysis of azimuthal distributions  @xcite .",
    "this yields the rapidity , transverse momentum , and centrality dependence of the fourier coefficients @xmath28 ( amplitude of @xmath29-th harmonic ) in the decomposition : e = = ( 1 + 2 v_1 ( ) + 2 v_2 ( 2 ) + 2 v_3 ( 3 ) + ... ) .",
    "[ ed3 ] the e877 spectrometer provides full @xmath30 acceptance in the spectrometer only for a very limited @xmath3 range ( approximately @xmath31  mev / c ) , but the triple differential multiplicity is constructed in full , using the @xmath30 range of the reaction plane angle distribution .",
    "note that the coverage of the calorimeters used for the reaction plane determination does not overlap with the spectrometer coverage , and thus the analysis is largely free from problems related to auto - correlations .",
    "similarly to the analysis presented in  @xcite , the reaction plane angle @xmath24 is determined in four non - overlapping pseudorapidity windows .",
    "the reaction plane resolution , i.e. the accuracy with which the reaction plane orientation is determined , is evaluated by studying the correlation between flow angles determined in different windows .",
    "finally , the flow signals are corrected for this resolution .",
    "details of this procedure are described in  @xcite . in short ,",
    "the true value of each fourier coefficient @xmath28 is obtained by : v_n = v_n/(n(_1-_r ) , where @xmath32 is the observed signal , and @xmath33 is the mean cosine of the difference of the reconstructed ( @xmath24 ) and true ( @xmath34 ) reaction plane angles , characterizing the reaction plane resolution .",
    "the values of @xmath33 are evaluated as outlined in @xcite . as a result",
    "we obtain the true azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane orientation : e = ( 1 + 2 v_1 ( _ lab-_r ) + 2 v_2 ( 2(_lab-_r))+ ... ) . [ ed3 t ]    the e877 spectrometer has a relatively small azimuthal coverage . due to this , the analysis of azimuthal anisotropies is rather sensitive to biases of different kinds , which could simulate an event anisotropy and propagate to the final results .",
    "for instance , during the off - line analysis , it was found that a small fraction of the recorded events ( @xmath35  24% ) have an anomalously high number of hits in the drift chambers . in these events",
    "the hit density was too high to perform reliable tracking and the high occupancy of the spectrometer was found to be correlated with the orientation of the reaction plane .",
    "a bias due to this was avoided by removing these events from the analysis completely and not only from the sample used to generate spectra . the tracking efficiency in the spectrometer ( typically on the order of 90% ) depends slightly on the spectrometer occupancy .",
    "a special correction for this effect was developed and checked by a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the correction is based on the weighting of each track in accordance with the local track densities in the drift chambers and time - of - flight wall . due to different gain factors and dead towers in the calorimeters",
    "the distribution in the reconstructed reaction plane angle is generally not flat .",
    "special precaution was taken to make the reaction plane angle distribution as flat as possible and to remove possible biases ( see appendix  a ) .    the fourier coefficients of azimuthal distributions evaluated by the procedure described above ( and corrected for the reaction plane resolution ) , are combined with the measurements of @xmath36 and rapidity spectra  @xcite . in this way",
    "the triple differential distributions in @xmath37 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 ( see equation  ( [ ed3 t ] ) ) are determined and analyzed .",
    "anisotropic flow reveals itself already in the dependence on the azimuthal emission angle of the inverse slope parameter of the invariant spectra @xmath39 when plotted as a function of @xmath40 for a given @xmath38 . here",
    ", @xmath41 is the transverse mass .",
    "we extract the inverse slope parameter @xmath42 by fitting the spectra in the region @xmath43  gev / c@xmath44 by a thermal ( boltzmann ) function e m_t ( - ) .",
    "[ efun3 ] the shape of the spectra is not perfectly reproduced by this function , and in order to obtain a good quality description of the spectra in the entire @xmath45 region , the weights of all points were chosen to be equal for the fit and not in accordance with statistical errors .    in fig .",
    "[ fspectra ] we show the @xmath45 spectra of protons emitted into the rapidity interval @xmath46 at different angles relative to the reaction plane together with these thermal fits for different centralities",
    ". clearly , the spectra of protons emitted in the direction of flow ( @xmath38=0 ) are significantly flatter than those of protons emitted in the opposite direction ( @xmath47 ) . to visualize the angular dependence of the inverse slope parameters the results from the fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fteff ] for three rapidity intervals . here",
    "@xmath48 is plotted as a function of the azimuthal emission angle .",
    "the results are presented for four centrality regions , selected in accordance with pcal @xmath49 and corresponding to the values of @xmath50 2313% , 139% , 94% , and @xmath514% ( see fig .  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is obtained by an integration of @xmath53 from a given value of @xmath49 to the maximal one observed , and the geometric cross section is defined as @xmath54  b , with @xmath55 and @xmath56=1.2  fm .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ fspectra ] and  [ fteff ] are not corrected for the reaction plane resolution .",
    "the correction would increase the difference between the maximal and minimal values of @xmath48 by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "such a correction ( in terms of @xmath57 ) is rather complicated ; for the quantitative description of the flow effects we use a fourier analysis of the azimuthal distributions  @xcite where all corrections are implemented .    we quantify directed flow by @xmath58 , the amplitude of the first harmonic in the fourier decomposition of the azimuthal particle distribution defined in equation  ( [ ed3 ] ) and corrected for the reaction plane resolution .",

    "[ fv1prot][fv1pm ] for protons and charged pions .",
    "the error - bars shown in all figures represent statistical errors only .",
    "the systematic uncertainties have mostly two sources : i ) the uncertainty in the determination of the reaction plane resolution leading to a relative error in @xmath58 of the order of 510% , similar for all particle species .",
    "ii ) the uncertainty in the occupancy correction , the accuracy of which we estimate , by inspection of monte - carlo simulations , to be of the order of 2030% .",
    "the correction itself is different for different particle species .",
    "it is negligible for positive pions ( and for negative pions from the 1993 run ) , which are registered in the low occupancy region of the spectrometer .",
    "the correction is maximal , and reaches absolute values of about 0.1 for the data shown , for protons at low @xmath36 and/or high rapidities .",
    "the rapidly increasing uncertainty in the occupancy correction in the spectrometer region close to the beam limits our measurements of proton flow at very low @xmath36 . multiplying the uncertainty in the occupancy correction with its absolute value we end up with a systematic error in the absolute value of @xmath58 of about 0.03 where the correction is maximal .    as can be seen from fig .",

    "protons of larger @xmath3 have larger values of @xmath60 with some tendency to saturation in the highest @xmath3 region .",

    "positive pions show @xmath58 values decreasing rapidly and monotonously towards negative values .",
    "conversely , for negative pions , the flow signal becomes at first positive , reaches a peak at about @xmath36=0.01 - 0.02 gev / c , and then decreases towards negative values where the flow signals for both pion charges merge .",

    "higher order harmonics ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) in the particle azimuthal distributions have also been analyzed .",
    "the accuracy in the evaluation of the contribution of higher harmonics deteriorates with increasing order due to the finite reaction plane resolution  ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",

    "there is an indication that the signal moves to higher @xmath36 values with decreasing rapidity .",
    "this combined with the smaller acceptance in @xmath36 at rapidities below 2.6 may be the reason that no significant signal is observed there . in our previous measurements of transverse energy and charged particle flow  @xcite a clear signal of elliptic flow was observed at all values of pseudorapidity .",
    "the observed positive values of @xmath69 correspond to an elliptically shaped distribution with the major axis lying in the reaction plane .",

    "the ( absolute ) accuracy in measuring @xmath70 is about 0.1 .",
    "for all particles , rapidities , and centralities of the collision the observed signals are consistent with zero within this accuracy .      weighted with @xmath36 and its probability distribution the coefficient @xmath58 yields @xmath71 , the mean value of the transverse momentum projected onto the reaction plane : = v_1(p_t ) p_t d p_t .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath71 values for pions was done by convoluting the experimental values of @xmath59 with the spectra without any extrapolation to the high @xmath36 region .",

    "it implies that the physics of pion flow is different from that of a moving source alone ( just as one would expect ) .",
    "a possible explanation of the pion flow signal could be found in a superposition of different effects : absorption in nuclear matter , coulomb interaction with comoving protons , and sideward motion of the source .    for pions produced in the center of the collision volume and moving in forward direction with velocities close to speed of light",

    "if the absorption of pions would occur on nucleons of the same rapidity , this would mean that the negative values of @xmath58 should increase towards zero for @xmath97 0.3 gev / c .",
    "most of the pions we observe are in a rapidity range where there are very few nucleons ( forward of beam rapidity ) .",

    "i.e. _ that the most forward nucleon source is at rapidity 2.5 in the laboratory . for pions at rapidities 3.0 , 3.4 , and 3.8",

    "[ fmpx2 ] by the open symbols , providing values for protons backward of rapidity 0.9 and for pions backward of rapidity 0.3 . to fill the gap at intermediate rapidities we use our measurement of the flow signal in transverse energy @xmath49 and charged particle multiplicity @xmath98 as published in  @xcite . in this paper transverse energy and charged particle flow were decomposed into nucleon and pion flow under a few simple assumptions .",
    "both were studied as a function of pseudorapidity . using these results and a simple parameterization of the proton and pion spectra in @xmath37 and @xmath36 from the ags experiment e866  @xcite and our own measurement  @xcite which together provide complete rapidity coverage , we evaluate @xmath71 as a function of rapidity .",
    "more specifically , we parameterize the spectra by expressions of the form : & & ( - ) m_t ( - ) , and & & t_b(y)=t_0 ( - ) with values of @xmath99 = 0.89 ( 0.88 ) , @xmath100 = 0.26 ( 0.15 ) gev , and @xmath101 = 1.06 ( 1.70 ) for protons ( charged pions ) . using these parameterizations we calculate the mean rapidity @xmath102 ( weighted with @xmath49 ) and the width of the rapidity interval associated with a bin in pseudorapidity .",
    "then , under the assumption that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are similar , one obtains @xmath71 as a function of rapidity : p_x(y ) p_t(y ) v_1^e_t(y ) .",
    "the resulting mean transverse momenta are presented as stars in fig .",
    "[ fmpx2 ] , together with our spectrometer results , for protons and pions ; the errors shown are a propagation of the statistical errors in the measured flow of @xmath49 and @xmath98 .",
    "the horizontal error - bars shown with the stars represent the widths of the rapidity region actually contributing to the pseudorapidity bins for which @xmath58 was measured .",
    "overall , the agreement between the results of the current analysis of spectrometer data at forward ( and backward ) rapidities and the results derived from the measurements of @xmath49 and @xmath98 flow is good . for the latter method we had estimated the systematic error for proton flow to be about 10%  @xcite ; this can also be judged from the symmetry of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fmpx2 ] with respect to midrapidity ( note that all stars correspond to measured points ) .",
    "the dotted line has been added to aid inspection of the data for the necessary antisymmetry .",
    "the first and the next to last proton point have equal distance from mid - rapidity and should be identical .",
    "they differ by 10 mev / c ( out of 80 mev / c ) . for the spectrometer",
    "results the systematic errors are largest at the lowest rapidities shown ( see fig .  [ fmpx ] and discussion ) where they are estimated to be 20 mev / c .    within these errors",
    "the points obtained from the two methods merge smoothly and taken together they provide a measurement of @xmath71 for protons and charged pions as a function of rapidity over practically the entire relevant rapidity range .",
    "one can see a proton flow signal rising away from midrapidity to maximal values of about 130 mev / c close to beam and target rapidities .",
    "the pion signal is in comparison very small , about 1/20 or the proton signal , but nevertheless significant .",
    "it is directed opposite to the nucleon flow signal .      in fig .",
    "[ fmpx2 ] we compare our results for @xmath71 with the predictions of the rqmd event generator  @xcite , versions 1.08 and 2.3 .",
    "version 1.08 , run in cascade mode , has been used for comparison to our earlier results for au + au collisions on pseudorapidity distributions  @xcite , proton and pion rapidity  @xcite and transverse mass  @xcite distributions as well as results for si+a and p+a collisions .",
    "for the au + au system it was found that overall many features of the data are predicted correctly with one striking deviation : generally proton spectra are significantly too steep in the model ; at midrapidity the inverse slope constant is only 2/3 of the experimental value .",
    "predictions from this version of the model have also been compared to our experimental results for flow in @xmath49 and @xmath98  @xcite and generally the model exhibited too little flow as compared to the data . comparing to the proton data in fig .",
    "[ fmpx2 ] , we find that the model also underpredicts the proton flow by nearly a factor of two . for pions , the sign change of the flow relative to protons is properly predicted but in magnitude the model overpredicts this opposite pion flow by a factor of 2 to 3 .    meanwhile , a new version of rqmd ( version 2.3 ) has been developed  @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time  @xcite that taking into account mean field effects by simulating in the model a skyrme - type nucleon - nucleon potential increases the slopes of proton spectra and at the same time increases the proton flow signal while reducing the opposite pion flow signal in magnitude .",
    "we have used the most recent version of the model in the so - called `` mean field '' mode to compare to the present data as well .",
    "indeed , in this version of the code the proton flow signal is larger by about 50% for the proton @xmath71 at the peak and the data are described rather well ( see fig .",
    "[ fmpx2 ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the opposite pion flow is reduced , again to a level consistent with the experimental data .",
    "it should be noted that at the same time the slope difference in the proton spectra is reduced ( at midrapidity the slope constant of the model is now 3/4 of what is observed in the data ) but a deviation persists at all rapidities .",
    "[ fv1rqmd ] shows that the agreement of the rqmd predictions ( version 2.3 , mean field ) with the experimental results for @xmath71 of protons as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fmpx2 ] may indeed be accidental .",
    "the functional dependence of the proton flow signal , expressed now in terms of the first fourier coefficient @xmath58 as a function of @xmath36 , is very different from what is seen in the data . in the model ,",
    "the flow signal rises at first with increasing @xmath36 and then becomes rather flat .",
    "in fact , in the rapidity bin around y = 2.9 the model overpredicts @xmath58 but at the same time underpredicts the overall slope of the proton spectrum by 25 % giving overall agreement in @xmath71 .",
    "an interesting question arises whether the rapidly rising and saturating @xmath36 dependence as exhibited by the rqmd predictions ( which is in fact a general trend observed for all rapidity bins ) is due to the rescattering - type mechanism which produces flow in a cascade code in contrast to a hydrodynamic flow mechanism ( reflected _ e.g. _ by the @xmath36 dependence of equations  ( [ ev1],[ev1mts ] ) ) .",
    "the elliptic flow signal seen in the anisotropy of @xmath49 and @xmath98 was found to be in good agreement with the rqmd ( version 1.08 ) prediction in our previous publication @xcite . as discussed above , the sign of this elliptic flow signal changes from negative ( preferential emission perpendicular to the reaction plane ) at lower beam energies ( 1 - 2 gev / nucleon range at the bevalac and sis ) to a positive signal ( preferential in - plane emission ) at the present energy .",
    "it was recently noted by sorge  @xcite that the @xmath69 anisotropies are sensitive to the pressure at the maximum compression .",
    "positive values of @xmath69 were in fact predicted in a hydrodynamic model by ollitrault for very high energies  @xcite .",
    "the observed change in sign between bevalac / sis and ags energies therefore implies that at ags energies already the final in - plane flow overwhelms the initial shadowing effect",
    ". it would be interesting to deduce , from this information , the pressure achieved at maximum baryon density in au + au collisions at the ags .",
    "the measured flow signals of identified particles show that , in semi  central collisions , protons ( nucleons ) exhibit strong directed flow .",
    "pions of low @xmath36 exhibit flow in the opposite direction ; at higher @xmath36 pions start to flow in the same direction as protons .",
    "the results on @xmath71 values for proton and pion are complementary in acceptance and match well with nucleon and pion flow values derived from the same experiment by measurement of @xmath49 and @xmath98 flow  @xcite . taken together , these results represent a directed flow measurement of protons and pions over nearly the entire rapidity region in au+au collisions at 11@xmath0 gev / c . the flow is found to be maximal around beam and target rapidities with values of @xmath71 for protons of about 130 mev / c and 5% of that for charged pions .",
    "the observed positive values of the second harmonic amplitudes of the proton azimuthal distributions correspond to preferential particle emission in the reaction plane .",
    "this observation agrees with our previous measurements of @xmath49 and @xmath98 elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "the nearly linear dependence of the proton flow signal @xmath58 on @xmath3 can be interpreted in the framework of a transversely moving thermal source .",
    "the corresponding source velocity @xmath94 appears to reach values of 0.1 in the beam rapidity region and for semi ",
    "central collisions .",
    "the more complicated @xmath36 dependence of the pion flow signals indicates that the effect there is probably a superposition of several effects such as absorption , coulomb interaction and overall motion of the source ( as for protons ) .",

    "we apply the following procedure to correct for the non - flatness of the reaction plane distribution .",
    "any flattening of the distribution means a correction to the reaction plane angle .",
    "we explicitly introduce this correction defining a new angle as : _",
    "1=_1+_1 . where @xmath105 is written in the form : _",
    "1= _ n ( a_n ( n _ 1 ) + b_n ( n_1 ) ) requiring the vanishing of the @xmath29-th fourier moment of the new distribution , the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be evaluated by the original distribution .",
    "b_n & = & ( n_1 ) , + a_n & = & - ( n_1 ) , where the brackets refer to an average over events .",
