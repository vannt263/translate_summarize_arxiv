    "the  image of m100 was obtained during two observing runs with the 4.2  m wht on la palma , using the taurus camera in imaging mode . since the field of view in this setup is limited by the filter size to around 5  diameter , four fields of the galaxy were imaged , two ( eastern half of m100 ) during the night of 27 may 1991 , and two ( western half ) during the night of 14 march 1992 .",

    "exposure times were 1200 seconds for both the on - line and the continuum image on the first night , and @xmath11 seconds on the second night .",

    ", the resulting error in the  region flux is always smaller than @xmath15% , and only approaches 10% for the smallest and faintest regions .",

    "the centre of the galaxy is in one of the corners of the chip , it was always possible to find sufficiently large areas to determine a reliable sky value .",
    "subtracted sky values ranged from 750 to 1000 counts in the four ( two on- plus two off - line ) eastern images , and from 150 to 500 counts in the eight western images .",
    "the lower sky values in the latter images are due to shorter exposure times , and a different position of the moon ( which was setting ) .",
    "note that lower sky background values result in lower residual noise in the final  images .",
    "the on- and off - line images were aligned to better than 0.2 pixel using fits to positions of foreground stars .",
    "these fits were also used to check and confirm that the seeing did not change within each set of images that were to be combined .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from the eastern images by hand , where pixels affected by cosmic ray hits were removed and replaced by the average value of a number of neighbouring pixels . in the case of the western exposures , where sets of two images at the same position , and imaged through the same filter , were available , cosmic ray hits could be removed automatically by comparing the values of identical pixels in each set of images , and replacing unexpectedly high pixel values by an average of their neighbour s values .",
    "comparison of the manual and automatic removal methods showed that both yield completely comparable and acceptable results .",
    "almost all cosmic ray hits were removed , but a few dubious cases ( @xmath16% of the number of unambiguously identified  regions ) were marked as such and discarded in the further analysis .    one curious linear feature which is not part of the galaxy is seen at position ra@xmath17 , @xmath18 . at low levels , it can be traced for some three minutes of arc .",
    "it is almost certainly due to a meteor which burned in the earth s atmosphere while the exposure was taken .    after aligning and cleaning the images ,",

    "following the same procedure as described by knapen et al .",
    "( 1993a ) for ngc  6814 , it was found that no scaling of the continuum images was necessary .",
    "this is because pairs of images were taken through filters with very similar bandwidths and transmissions and in practically the same observing conditions .    at this stage",
    "there are four sub - images of m100 , with the central region of the galaxy in another corner of the sub - image in each case . the properties ( seeing , noise , etc . )",
    "are slightly different for each of the four , as summarized in table  1 .",

    "i fitted slopes to the lfs in each radial bin .",
    "as before , the choice of what range in @xmath23 to include in the fit is somewhat subjective and can directly influence the results , so i chose to use exactly the same range in all cases ( with the exception of radial bins @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the inclusion of the last point leads to an unrealistic fit to the data set , and for bin @xmath26 where there is no data point for @xmath27 ) .",

    "the lf slopes become shallower with increasing @xmath20 , although this is hardly significant taking the errors on the fits into account .",
    "two discrepant values of the fitted slope occur for the first radial bin , @xmath29 , and for bin no .",

    "8 is probably the cause of the deviant lf slope in that bin .",
    "the integral diameter distribution of  regions in spiral galaxies usually follows an exponential law :    @xmath30    with @xmath31 the total number of  regions with diameters larger than @xmath32 ( van den bergh 1981 ; hodge 1987 ; ye 1992 ) .",
    "the slope of the diameter distribution is correlated with the luminosity of the galaxy ( hodge 1987 ; see also rozas et al .",
    "1996b ) , and the slopes tend to be steeper for  regions located between the spiral arms than for those within them in the few cases where this has been explicitly studied ( hodge 1987 ; knapen et al .",
    "1993a ) .    the integral diameter distribution of the  regions in the disc of m100 is shown in fig .  [ diams ] ( full dots )",
    "apart from the first point , and the last three points in the figure , the data are fitted very well with an exponential of the type described above . as usual , the fit to the data points is indicated in the figure .",
    "i also show integral diameter distributions for the  regions in the cnr ( open circles in fig .",

    "[ aiadiams ] ) . in all cases",
    "the data points can be well fitted with an exponential of the type described above .",
    "the fitted values to the slopes are @xmath33pc and @xmath34 for the whole disc , @xmath35pc and @xmath36 for the cnr  regions only , and @xmath37pc and @xmath38 ; and @xmath39pc and @xmath40 for the arm and interarm  regions , respectively",
    ".    the smaller size scale in the interarm region could be due to evolutionary effects , the interarm  regions being more evolved ( oey & clarke 1998 ) and smaller since their stromgren sphere will have shrunk .",
    "more likely , however , the smaller interarm value for @xmath41 is due to the fact that in the arms  regions overlap more often , and determining the diameters of the smaller  regions will be more difficult .",
    "the disc value derived here is significantly smaller than values derived by other authors : after correcting to the distance to m100 as used in the present paper , arsenault et al . ( 1990 ) find @xmath42  pc , cepa & beckman ( 1990a ) @xmath43  pc , and banfi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) @xmath44  pc ( no erros given ) . especially in the case of banfi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who catalogue only 83  regions for m100 , the larger values found in the literature can be explained by a smaller number of  regions used as input for the diameter determination .",
    "this is usually a result of a combination of lower resolution and lower sensitivity in the  images , leading to overestimates of the diameters of  region complexes which would have been resolved using better imaging .",
    "the value of @xmath33  pc places m100 below the relation found by hodge ( 1987 ) between the absolute magnitude @xmath45 and the  region size scale @xmath41 for spiral galaxies .",
    "however , the effects on systematic and instrumental influences on the individual data points in the @xmath45 vs. @xmath41 relation , as outlined above , remain to be investigated .",
    "the diameter distribution for the cnr shows a steeper slope than any of the others , and the interarm slope is significantly steeper than the arm slope , following the trend set in earlier work ( hodge 1987 ; knapen et al .",
    ". however , especially in the cnr the diameter determination may be less reliable due to crowding , making it harder to determine the true extent of the  regions , and thus underestimating the diameters of many of them .",
    "on the other hand , one would expect the same effect to have more impact on the arm than on the interarm  regions , so the shallower slope for the arm regions may in fact be a lower limit to the true slope .",
    "finally , the fact that the lfs are very similar for the arm and interarm region populations means that interarm  regions will have , on average , higher surface brightnesses than arm  regions ( see also knapen et al .",
    "1993a ) .",
    "[ numdens ] shows the number density of  regions in m100 as a function of deprojected distance from the centre .",
    "the number density is defined as the number of  regions in annular bins of 10  width , normalized by the area in which they are found .",
    "number densities are shown for all  regions in the catalogue , and for arm and interarm  regions separately . at the innermost data point",
    "the number density is in fact 9.8 , a high value caused by the large number of  regions in the cnr .",
    "the distribution is characterised by a number of components that can be easily recognised morphologically , e.g. on the grey - scale image of fig .",
    "[ hamap ] , namely the strongly star - forming cnr ( @xmath46 ) , the bar which is mostly devoid of massive sf ( @xmath47 ) , the star - forming spiral arms ( @xmath48 ) , and the outer disc , with only sporadically occurring  regions ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "note that these components were also identified by knapen & beckman ( 1996 ) from a radial profile . within the spiral arm region ,",
    "the highest number density of  regions occurs in a relatively small area with radii between some 50  and 80 .",
    "this is the region where the large star - forming complexes are located which can be seen in e.g. fig .",
    "[ hamap ] near the ends of the bar , and especially in the spiral arm part south of the nuclear region , connecting with the western end of the bar .",
    "the separate arm and interarm  region distribution shows less interarm  regions in the crowded areas in the arms ( @xmath50 ) , and more interarm than arm regions in the bar region and at specific radii further out in the disc ( e.g. @xmath51 ) .",
    "in general , the number density distribution is similar to the radial profile as shown by knapen & beckman ( 1996 ; their fig .",
    "4 ) , where the radial  profile is plotted logarithmically .",
    "note that the outermost  regions occur at distances @xmath52 from the centre , the outermost one lies near @xmath53 .",
    "in this paper , i present a detailed study of a new , high - quality continuum - subtracted image of the grand - design spiral galaxy m100 . from the image ,",
    "i have catalogued a total of 1948 individual  regions , and tabulated basic properties for each  region : position with respect to the centre , radius , and integrated flux .",
    "a substantial part of the paper is devoted to deriving lfs for the complete sample of  regions , and sub - samples of the whole set , defined on the basis of the location of the  regions in the galaxy . following previous work , separate lfs for arm ,",
    "interarm and cnr  regions were derived , but the huge number of individual  regions available also made it possible , for the first time , to derive a set of nine lfs for  regions at increasing distance from the centre .    the total lf ( fig .",
    "[ disclf ] ) shows the by now well - known shape and characteristics ( see e.g. kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 ; rand 1992 ; knapen et al .",
    "1993a ; and rozas et al . 1996a for lfs of other galaxies ) .",
    "a sharp cut - off at low luminosities indicates our detection limit , while the slope at luminosities larger than the completeness limit can be well fitted with a power law , giving an lf slope of @xmath54 , well within the limits established in the previous works for a galaxy of this morphological type .",
    "i fail to detect a significant difference between the lf slopes for the arm and interarm populations of regions . as discussed before , this does not contradict published results by cepa & beckman ( 1990a ) who studied the central part of m100 .",
    "this adds yet another galaxy to the list of those that do not show significantly different arm vs. interarm  region lf slopes .",
    "rand ( 1992 ) did find significantly different slopes in m51 , a galaxy with a relatively small number of interarm  regions and strong density waves in its disc , as did kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for a number of their galaxies , although the latter result was based on observational data of considerably lower quality than those used in later work .",
    "kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1989 ) present a combined result for five galaxies , which shows slightly steeper slopes for interarm regions ( no fits to the slopes or estimates of errors are given so the significance of the result can not be easily compared with those for other galaxies ) .",
    "rand ( 1992 ) interpreted the significantly different arm - interarm lf slopes in terms of a different molecular cloud mass spectrum , but oey & clarke ( 1998 ) explain such differences in general by evolutionary effects and the maximum number of ionizing stars per cluster .",
    "knapen et al .",
    "( 1993a ) and rozas et al .",
    "( 1996a ) did not find significant arm - interarm lf slope differences in the 5 galaxies they studied .    in most cases where interarm and arm lf slopes have been considered , the interarm lf slopes are marginally steeper than arm lf slopes , although not significantly so .",
    "but for two of the four galaxies studied by rozas et al .",
    "( 1996a ) the arm lf slope is steeper , so even _ if _ the trend noticed exists , it is not unique . the only way forward is to observe more galaxies , but significantly different lf slopes in arm and interarm environments can be ruled out based on the existing data , with the exception of one galaxy ( m51 ) .",
    "this implies that the observed occurrence of many large  regions in the spiral arms does not indicate a preference for the larger regions to form there , but merely a statistical effect : there are more  regions in the arms , so there will also be more large ones ( e.g. elmegreen 1993 ) .",
    "the spiral density waves which must be present in grand - design galaxies thus only re - organize the material from which the stars form , and the sf , into the arms .",
    "this agrees with the observed lack of correlation between the sf rates per unit area and arm class ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1986 ) .",
    "but equal arm and interarm  region lf slopes seem harder to unite with the observed higher massive sf efficiencies within the arms as compared to outside the arms ( cepa & beckman 1990b ; knapen et al . 1992 , 1996 ) , which are prima facie evidence for triggering of the massive sf within the arms , presumably by the density wave",
    ". the overall conclusion must be that _ whereas the density wave organizes the material into the arms _ , and enhances ( triggers ) the massive sf , _ it does not in fact change the mass distribution of the star - forming molecular clouds _ , and thus of the statistical properties of the  region population .",
    "it just allows more of basically the same  regions to start emitting in the arms .",
    "there is a slight change in the lf slopes with increasing radius ( fig .",
    "[ sloperad ] ) , with slopes decreasing ( becoming shallower ) with increasing radius .",
    "note that rand ( 1992 ) found a steeper slope in the outer part of the disc of m51 than in the inner part , a result which goes in the opposite direction as the trend found here for m100 .",
    "the result for m100 would indicate the presence of relatively more large  regions at larger distances from the centre , or , following the results of the theoretical treatment by rozas ( 1996 ) , a shallower imf further out in the disc . alternatively , evolutionary effects in the  region population , as described by e.g. oey & clarke ( 1998 ) , could be responsible for the observed effect .",
    "this is an interesting point which should be followed up by more extensive study , preferably through spectroscopic observations of decent numbers of  regions at varying distances from the centre .",
