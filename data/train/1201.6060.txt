    "in many fields of physics , especially in the fields of information processing , material science , superfluidity , and the relatively new field of quantum information theory , a profound understanding of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems is of striking importance in order to further improve existing applications and invent new ones @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that these research fields mainly use solid - state systems in which strongly correlated systems appear quite naturally .",
    "however , it is experimentally challenging to access the microscopic properties of such systems due to the short time and length scales involved .",
    "therefore , motivated by feynman s conjecture of the quantum simulator @xcite , artificial structures have been considered to create effective many - body systems , which can be investigated under much more controllable and tunable experimental conditions .",
    "the first attempts to build up artificial many - body structures used josephson junction arrays @xcite , which proved to be capable of simulating the dynamic properties of bose - hubbard systems including the generic quantum phase transition of this model @xcite . additionally , over the last two decades , the advances in preparing and controlling ultra - cold atoms led to new experimental realizations , which raised a huge amount of interest and research in this field .",
    "for example one investigated the interference of bec clouds @xcite , studied rotating bec s @xcite , observed spinor condensates @xcite , where bec occurs in different hyperfine states , analyzed bose - fermi mixtures @xcite , where a pure bec is contaminated with fermions , described bec s in disordered potentials @xcite , dipolar bec s @xcite , and , more recently , tried to probe the properties of bec s in zero gravity @xcite .",
    "+ of particular interest for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems has been the realization of bec s trapped in optical lattices @xcite . since their experimental realization",
    ", optical - lattice systems have initiated intensive studies and led to a multitude of new applications such as entanglement of atoms @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , bell state experiments @xcite , disorder @xcite , and ultra - cold molecules @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental approaches discussed so far face some crucial limitations . on the one hand",
    ", it is necessary to cool down the considered system to some nano kelvin above absolute zero and , on the other hand , it is experimentally challenging to control and access single sites individually , however , recently developed experimental techniques also allow for single site addressability @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these experiments still need ultra - cold temperatures , a restriction which could be circumvented by using cavity lattices .      encouraged by the latest progress in the fabrication and manipulation of micro cavities @xcite , philippe grangier and others @xcite proposed a new experimental setup using cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) schemes .",
    "the underlying idea behind this new approach is to build up a lattice from micro cavities and place some real or artificial atoms in each cavity , for example josephson junctions or quantum dots .",
    "subsequently , light is coupled into the system in such a way , that it interacts with the atoms . as a result , the coupling between the light field and the atoms leads to the formation of quasi - particles , so called polaritons .",
    "these quasi - particles behave like real bosonic particles on the lattice . in fact , bose - einstein condensation of polaritons was recently experimentally achieved in semi - conductor cavities filled with quantum wells @xcite and even superfluidity could be observed @xcite .",
    "this new idea for a quantum simulator based on cavity qed does not share the above mentioned limitations of the optical lattice approach .",
    "due to relatively huge distances between the cavities , local control and accessibility emerges quite naturally for these systems .",
    "hence , it is possible to analyze these systems without destroying them , in contrast to the time - of - flight imaging technique used for ultracold quantum gases .",
    "since the atoms are trapped inside the cavities right from the start and their thermal motion does not quantitatively disturb the polariton dynamics @xcite , bec experiments with cavity qed setups can thus be performed even at room temperatures @xcite . however , in order to facilitate stable experiments with this setup , one needs a strong coupling between light and matter in order to reduce the losses induced by the spontaneous emission .",
    "fortunately , over the past few years , this so called _ strong - coupling regime _",
    "@xcite has become experimentally accessible for a large number of different setups @xcite .",
    "+ however , a drawback of the strong coupling is the short polariton lifetime which prevents to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , in a real experiment the polaritons decay faster then they can equilibrate via phonon emission and polariton - polariton scattering and therefore the system needs to be continuously pumped by an external laser .",
    "recently , f. nissen et al .  theoretically investigated the coherently driven and dissipative jchm @xcite .",
    "they could show that the important photon - blockade effect prevails in this system for weak hopping .",
    "this effect guarantees a strong polariton - polariton interaction which allows the system to reach a quasi thermal equilibrium @xcite . in principal one",
    "can modify the method presented in this paper to include external baths in order to account for this non - equilibrium situation . subsequently tracing out the bath degrees of freedom",
    "yields an effective theory for the reduced system .",
    "nevertheless , we will in this paper focus on the quasi equilibrium situation with a steady state polariton density in order to demonstrate the theoretical feasibility .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "@xmath0 we will introduce the underlying hamiltonian for the jaynes - cummings hubbard ( jch ) model and briefly analyze its dynamical properties in some special limits . in section @xmath1",
    "we will derive an effective ginzburg - landau action for the model . to this end",
    "we will use the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , that has already been successfully applied to analyze collective excitations of bose gases in optical lattices @xcite , and transfer it to a cavity qed system .",
    "in contrast to other methods , this procedure yields a consistent thermodynamic theory for finite temperatures in the whole quantum phase diagram .",
    "therefore our ginzburg - landau approach is of relevance in order to develop a thermometer for the jchm .",
    "for instance , to establish a thermometer for the usual bose - hubbard model turned out to be a difficult task @xcite .",
    "the respective results for both static and dynamic properties as well as their temperature dependence obtained from the effective action will be presented in section @xmath2 . in particular",
    "we focus on the excitation spectra and on the sound velocity of light and discuss their dependence on the experimentally accessible detuning parameter .",
    "for our lattice model we consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 using the convention @xmath4 throughout this paper , the local part of this hamiltonian is given by @xmath5\\ ] ] and consists of a sum over local jaynes - cummings hamiltonians in the _ rotating wave approximation _",
    "( rwa ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 denotes the frequency of the local monochromatic photon fields associated with the annihilation and creation operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 corresponds to the detuning between the local mode frequency @xmath6 and the energy splitting @xmath10 of each two - level system .",
    "the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ladder operators of the two - level systems and @xmath13 is the real coupling strength between each two - level system and the bosonic mode .",
    "the operator @xmath14 represents the on - site polariton number operator and @xmath15 is the total polariton number operator . as it commutes with @xmath16 ,",
    "the number of these polaritons , which are coupled excitations of the two - level system and the local light fields , is a conserved quantity in this model . finally , working in the grand - canonical ensemble , yields an additional term in the hamiltonian which is proportional to the polariton number operator and the chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "+ the jaynes - cummings model is well known in the literature and the underlying hamiltonian can be exactly diagonalized within the rwa @xcite leading to the energy eigenvalues @xmath18,\\;n>1 , \\\\e_{0}&=&0,\\ ; n=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + here , we introduced the generalized rabi frequency @xmath19 and the effective chemical potential @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath21 correspond to the energy eigenstates    [ e : dressedstatesdefinition ] @xmath22    with the mixing angle @xmath23 .",
    "the vacuum state is given by @xmath24 .",
    "we note that the energy spectrum for a fixed polariton number @xmath25 naturally splits into an upper and a lower branch , where the lower branch is always lower in energy than the upper branch .",
    "+ the possibility for photons to tunnel between next neighboring cavities is modeled by a hubbard - like hopping hamiltonian of the form @xmath26 where the sum runs over all next neighbor lattice sites . as the tunnel matrix elements @xmath27 exponentially decay with increasing distance between the lattice sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 , it is justified to assume that @xmath30 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are next neighbors and @xmath31 otherwise .",
    "+ as a first analysis of the ground - state of the model described by eq .",
    "we consider the physically relevant extremes of both the atomic and the hopping limit . in the atomic limit @xmath32 , eq",
    ".   simplifies to @xmath33 which decomposes into purely local contributions with eigenvalues .",
    "obviously , in this regime the photons can not move in the lattice and , thus , all excitations are pinned to their respective lattice sites .",
    "therefore , the ground state wave function of the whole lattice is simply a direct product of the local on - site ground state wave functions .",
    "for this reason the ground state of the whole system is reached when each on - site jaynes - cummings system is in the lowest energy state @xmath34 or one of the lower - branch states @xmath35 . however , decreasing the difference @xmath36 one eventually reaches a point when @xmath37 and , hence , adding a polariton excitation becomes energetically favorable .",
    "the successive repetition of this argument leads to a complete set of such degeneracy points @xmath38 , which are characterized by the explicit relations :    @xmath39,\\;&n>1\\\\   \\frac{\\mu_{\\rm{eff}}}{g}&=\\frac{1}{2\\,g}\\left[\\delta - r_{1}(\\delta)\\right],\\;&n=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above discussion follows that , in the atomic limit , the local polariton number is fixed at each lattice site for a given set of parameters .",
    "when the total polariton number equals an integer multiple of the number of cavities , this regime is called the mott insulating phase which has been predicted @xcite and experimentally observed in the bose - hubbard model @xcite . + as a second interesting limit we investigate the ground - state in the regime when @xmath40 , i.e. where the photon hopping dominates the system dynamics .",
    "we additionally assume that all two - level systems are in their respective ground - state as the system minimizes the energy .",
    "hence , we can drop all atomic contributions , which leads to the hopping - limit hamiltonian @xmath41 this hamiltonian can be diagonalized in fourier space leading to @xmath42 with the energy dispersion @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the lattice constant of a simple @xmath45-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the hopping limit is local in fourier space .",
    "this situation corresponds to the superfluid phase of the system .",
    "signatures of this phase have already been observed in the interference patterns of time - of - flight experiments with bose - hubbard systems @xcite .",
    "in the following section we derive an effective action for the jch model from the free energy . explicitly calculating the lowest hopping order contributions of the effective action amounts effectively to a resummation of infinitely many hopping contributions . therefore , this effective action allows us to determine the quantum phase transition as well as calculate the excitation spectra , energy gap , effective mass , and sound velocity for finite temperatures in the mott phase and in the superfluid phase .      following the approach used for example in refs .",
    "@xcite we additionally introduce source currents @xmath46 , in the system hamiltonian leading to the new hamiltonian @xmath47=\\hat{h}+\\sum_{i}\\left[j_{i}^{*}(\\tau)\\,\\hat{a}_{i}+j_{i}(\\tau)\\,\\hat{a}_{i}^{\\dagger}\\right],\\ ] ] which is now a functional of the currents .",
    "these artificial currents , which explicitly depend on the imaginary - time variable @xmath48 , will be used to artificially break the @xmath49 symmetry that is responsible for the quantum phase transition in the model @xcite . since all physical results are obtained in the limit of vanishing currents",
    ", we can treat all terms in the hamiltonian , which are proportional to the source currents , as small quantities .",
    "furthermore , for small hopping amplitudes @xmath50 all off - diagonal contributions in eq .",
    "become small .",
    "hence , we decompose the new system hamiltonian into the form @xmath51=\\hat{h}_{0}+\\hat{h}_{1}(\\tau)\\left[j , j^{*}\\right],\\ ] ] where the local part @xmath16 from eq .",
    "is exactly solvable and the remaining part @xmath52=\\hat{h}_{\\rm{h}}+\\sum_{i}\\left[j_{i}^{*}(\\tau)\\,\\hat{a}_{i}+j_{i}(\\tau)\\,\\hat{a}_{i}^{\\dagger}\\right]\\ ] ] with the hopping hamiltonian @xmath53 from eq .   can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "+ we aim at establishing a thermodynamic perturbation theory in the present section .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to switch from the schrdinger picture to the imaginary - time dirac interaction picture .",
    "this leads to a reformulation of the partition function as a perturbation series , involving just the perturbative part of the full hamiltonian of the system . introducing the abbreviation @xmath54 with the inverse temperature @xmath55 for the thermal average with respect to the unperturbed system",
    ", the partition function takes on the following form @xmath56 here , the partition function of the unperturbed system is given by @xmath57 and the imaginary - time evolution operator in the dirac picture is defined as @xmath58\\right\\rbrace.\\ ] ] note that all operators , which depend on imaginary - time variables , have to be taken in the imaginary - time dirac interaction picture , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "+ using the above definition together with eqs .   and we see that the partition function also becomes a functional of @xmath60 and @xmath61 . splitting the grand - canonical partition functional into the respective perturbative contributions @xmath62=\\mathcal{z}_{0}\\left\\lbrace 1+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\mathcal{z}_{n}\\left[j , j^{*}\\right]\\right\\rbrace , \\ ] ] the free energy defined by @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64=\\mathcal{f}_{0}-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln\\left\\{1+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\mathcal{z}_{n}\\left[j , j^{*}\\right]\\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] here we introduced the free energy of the unperturbed system as the usual expression @xmath65 . in the next step",
    "we expand the free energy functional in a power series of the perturbation parameters @xmath66 . in this paper",
    "we will focus just on the lowest order contributions from the hopping and thus neglect all terms of higher than first order in @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , according to the landau theory @xcite , one needs to consider all terms at least up to fourth order in the order parameter to describe the thermodynamic properties of a second order phase transition .",
    "since we will see later on that the source currents @xmath67 are of the order of the ginzburg - landau order parameter for the considered system , we thus have to calculate the power series up to fourth order in @xmath67 .",
    "hence , we expand the logarithm in expression and keep all terms up to fourth order in @xmath29 and @xmath68 and first order in @xmath69 . +",
    "this procedure leads to an expansion of the free energy functional in terms of imaginary time integrals over sums of products of thermal green functions with respect to the unperturbed system of increasing order .",
    "the @xmath70th order thermal green function with respect to the unperturbed system is defined as @xmath71\\right\\rangle _ { 0}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in principle , one could now make use of the definition and calculate the expansion coefficients of the free energy straightforwardly .",
    "however , with increasing order of the thermal green function the calculation becomes more and more complex due to the increasing number of space- and time - index permutations .",
    "therefore , we use another approach to calculate the thermal green functions , which automatically takes care of the emerging problems .",
    "usually one would apply in field theory the wick theorem to decompose @xmath70-point correlation functions into sums of products of @xmath0-point correlation functions @xcite . unfortunately , this is not possible for the considered system , since the wick theorem just holds for systems , where the unperturbed hamiltonian is linear in the occupation number operator .",
    "instead , in our case one has to use the so called _ cumulant expansion _ , which was originally developed for the hubbard model as is reviewed by metzner @xcite .",
    "it states that the logarithm of the partition function is given by the sum of all connected green functions .",
    "the power of this approach lies in the fact that these connected green functions can subsequently be derived from a single generating functional by performing functional derivatives with respect to the currents . due to the fact that the unperturbed hamiltonian decomposes into a sum over local contributions , the generating functional decomposes into products of purely local cumulants : @xmath72=&\\underset{i}{\\prod}\\ln\\left\\langle\\hat{t}e^{-\\underset{0}{\\overset{\\beta}{\\int}}d\\tau\\left[j_{i}(\\tau)\\hat{a}_{i}^{\\dagger}(\\tau)+j_{i}^{*}(\\tau)\\hat{a}_{i}(\\tau)\\right]}\\right\\rangle _ { 0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the local cumulants then follow from @xmath73}{\\delta j_{i_{1}^{\\prime}}\\left(\\tau_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\ldots\\delta j_{i_{n}^{\\prime}}\\left(\\tau_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)\\delta j_{i_{1}}^{*}\\left(\\tau_{1}\\right)\\ldots\\delta j_{i_{n}}^{*}\\left(\\tau_{n}\\right)}\\right|_{j = j^{*}=0}.\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the local structure of all cumulants vanish unless the site indexes are all equal which yields the relation @xmath74 hence , we just have to calculate the _ local _ cumulants @xmath75 . performing the calculations according to formula and rearranging the resulting terms yields the cumulant decomposition for each thermal green function .",
    "the lowest order green functions read @xmath76 with this cumulant decomposition we find the following expansion of the free energy functional    @xmath77=\\mathcal{f}_{0}-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_{i , j}\\int_{0}^ { \\beta}d\\tau_{1}\\,\\int_{0}^ { \\beta}d\\tau_{2}\\,\\bigg\\ { \\bigg[a_{2}^{(0)}\\left(i;\\tau_{1}|\\tau_{2}\\right)\\delta_{ij}+a_{2}^{(1)}\\left(i;\\tau_{1}|\\tau_{2};j\\right)\\bigg]\\,j_{i}(\\tau_{1})\\,j_{j}^{*}(\\tau_{2})\\notag\\\\ %   & + \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^ { \\beta}d\\tau_{3}\\,\\int_{0}^ { \\beta}d\\tau_{4}\\bigg[a_{4}^{(0)}\\left(i;\\tau_{1},\\tau_{3}|\\tau_{2},\\tau_{4}\\right)\\delta_{ij}+2\\,a_{4}^{(1)}\\left(i;\\tau_{1},\\tau_{3}|\\tau_{2},\\tau_{4};j\\right)\\bigg]\\,j_{j}(\\tau_{1})\\,j_{i}(\\tau_{3})\\,j_{i}^{*}(\\tau_{2})\\,j_{j}^{*}(\\tau_{4})\\notag\\\\ %   & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^ { \\beta}d\\tau_{3}\\,\\int_{0}^ { \\beta}d\\tau_{4}\\,\\tilde{a}_{4}^{(1)}\\left(i;\\tau_{1},\\tau_{3}|\\tau_{2},\\tau_{4};j\\right)\\,j_{j}(\\tau_{1})\\,j_{i}(\\tau_{3})\\,j_{i}^{*}(\\tau_{2})\\,j_{j}^{*}(\\tau_{4})\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the introduced expansion coefficients are defined as @xmath78 due to the locality of @xmath16 in eq .   the cumulants @xmath79 do not depend on the site indexes @xmath80 .",

    "finally , we notice that the form of the above coefficients @xmath81 , and @xmath82 can be further simplified by going into frequency space .",
    "therefore we perform the matsubara transformation @xmath83 with the matsubara frequencies @xmath84 at first , we calculate the coefficient @xmath85 in matsubara space . due to frequency conservation",
    "the following relation has to hold @xmath86 this coefficient can be derived from the expression with the help of relations and by performing a matsubara transformation . using the polariton mapping introduced in ref .",

    "since the symmetry - breaking currents @xmath67 are no physical quantities , one has to transform them into physical fields in terms of the order parameter .",

    "[ f : subsoundk ] and [ f : subsoundd ] .",
    "figure [ f : subsoundk ] shows the dependence of the sound velocity on the hopping strength .",
    "we find that it approaches a finite value at the tip of the mott lobe , but vanishes at all other points of the mott lobe .",
    "this behaviour shows that the jch model has a dynamical critical exponent of @xmath175 which has been recently confirmed in a large - scale quantum monte - carlo simulation by m. hohenadler et al .",

    "our result is in accordance with the results found from mean - field calculations @xcite .",

    "we investigated the temperature dependence of both the pair excitation energy gap and the effective mass of the particle and hole excitations in the mott phase .",
    "furthermore , we analyzed how the sound velocity in the superfluid phase depends at zero temperature on the hopping parameter and the detuning parameter .",

    "here we evaluate the fourth order coefficient , which involves the expectation values of time ordered products of four operators .",
    "first we notice that , for the time - ordered product of two annihilation and two creation operators , there are @xmath176 distinct permutations leading to different expectation values .",
    "each of these orderings itself has @xmath2 time variable permutations corresponding to @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "thus , overall one finds @xmath179 terms for the expectation value .",
    "luckily , the integrals over different time - variable permutations yield the same result , and thus , they just lead to a fixed pre - factor @xmath2 . for this reason ,",
    "one just needs to determine the @xmath176 different thermal averages for one specific time - ordering .",
    "furthermore , these expectation values are local quantities and , therefore , we drop the site indexes in the following calculations .",
    "thus , one has to determine the following expressions : @xmath180 with the help of the polariton mapping introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can calculate these averages straightforwardly .",
    "hence , we find for example the following expression for the expectation value @xmath181 subsequently , performing a matsubara transformation according to yields a formal integral of the form @xmath182 with the solution @xmath183.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the variables @xmath184 correspond to differences of energy eigenvalues . due to energy conservation",
    "these variables have to fulfill the condition @xmath185 and thus the above solution has a pole in the first term .",
    "therefore , we have to take the limit @xmath186 since this pole arises for all expectation values we always have to consider this particular limit . taking this result into account , the explicit expression for the expectation value in matsubara space is given by      however , this expression still possesses some poles for special choices of matsubara frequencies .",
    "fortunately , all these poles can be eliminated by investigating the corresponding limits analogous to equation .",
    "further care has to be taken considering the occurrence of the ground - state energy due to its uniqueness .",
    "similar expressions can be calculated for the other expectation values .",

    "<S> we develop a ginzburg - landau theory for the jaynes - cummings - hubbard model which effectively describes both static and dynamic properties of photons evolving in a cubic lattice of cavities , each filled with a two - level atom . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the effective action to first - order in the hopping parameter . within a landau description of a spatially and temporally constant order parameter </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the finite - temperature mean - field quantum phase boundary between a mott insulating and a superfluid phase of polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , within the ginzburg - landau description of a spatio - temporal varying order parameter we determine the excitation spectra in both phases and , in particular , the sound velocity of light in the superfluid phase . </S>"
