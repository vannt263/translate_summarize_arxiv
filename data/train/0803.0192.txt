    "it is generally believed that standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is one of the most successful theory of the second half of previous century in explaining the observed data so far , but no one can say that it is the end of physics . intensive search for physics beyond sm is now being performed in various areas of particle physic which is expected to get the direct evidence at high energy colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . during the last years",
    "there has been an increased interest in models with extra dimensions , since they solve the hierarchy problem and can provide the unified framework of gravity and other interactions together with a connection with the string theory @xcite . among them a special role play the ones with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) as in these models all sm fields are allowed to propagate in all available dimensions .",
    "the economy of ued models is that there is only one new free parameter in addition to sm , the radius @xmath2 of the compactified extra dimension . now above the compactification scale @xmath6",
    "a given ued model become a higher dimensional field theory whose equivalent description in four dimensions consists of sm fields , the towers of their kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners and additional towers of kk modes having no partner in sm .",
    "appelquist , cheng and dobrescu ( acd ) model @xcite , with one extra universal dimension is the simplest model of this type . in this model",
    "the only additional free parameter relative to sm is the compactification scale @xmath6 .",
    "thus , all the masses of the kk particles and their interactions with sm particles and also among themselves are described in terms of @xmath6 and the parameters of sm @xcite .",
    "the most profound property of acd model is the conservation of kk parity which implies the absences of tree level contribution of kk states to the low energy processes taking place at scale @xmath7 .",
    "this brings interest towards the flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath8 , as these are not allowed at tree level but are induced by the glashow - iliopoulos - miani ( gim ) amplitudes @xcite at the loop level in the sm and hence the one loop contribution due to kk modes to them could in principle be important .",
    "these processes are used to constrain the mass and couplings of kk  states , i.e. the compactification parameter @xmath6 04 .",
    "buras and collaborators have computed the effective hamiltonian of several fcnc processes in acd model , particularly in @xmath9 sector , namely @xmath10 mixing and @xmath8 transition such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the implications of physics with ued are being examined with the data from accelerator experiments , for example , from tevatron experiments the bound on the inverse of compactification radius is found to be about @xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "exclusive @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays are analyzed in acd model and it was shown that the uncertainties connected with hadronic matrix elements does not mask the sensitivity to the compactification parameter , and the current data on the decay rates of @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath4 can provide a similar bound to the inverse compactification radius : @xmath19 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition to these the decay modes @xmath20 @xmath4 , @xmath21 , @xmath22  and @xmath23 have also been considered , with the possibility of observing such processes at hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "et al_. have also considered another set of observables in fcnc  transitions , namely those of the inclusive @xmath24 and exclusive @xmath25 decay modes , where the leptons are @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "there is no experimental data on these days as yet , however as first noticed in @xcite , these processes are of great interest due to the possibility of measuring lepton polarization asymmetries which are sensitive to the structure of the interactions , so that they can be used to test the sm and its extensions .",
    "they analyzed the @xmath27 polarization asymmetries in single universal extra dimension model both for inclusive and exclusive semileptonic @xmath28 meson decays .",
    "besides this , they investigated another observable , the fraction of longitudinal @xmath29 polarization in @xmath18 , for which a new measurement in two bins of momentum transfer to the lepton pair is available in case of @xmath30 .",
    "they studied the dependence of this quantity on the compactification parameter , for @xmath31 and in the case of light leptons , together with the fraction of @xmath29 polarization in the same modes , and discussed the possibility to constrain the universal extra dimension scenario .    in this work",
    ", we will study the spin effects on @xmath32 in acd model using the framework of @xmath33 described by colangelo _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "we investigate the branching ratio , forward backward and polarization asymmetries for the final state @xmath27 . although the sensitivity of branching ratio and forward backward asymmetry on the extra dimension is mild but",
    "still we believe that together with the @xmath27 lepton polarization asymmetries , these can be used to provide additional constraints on the comactification parameter . in extension to this , we have also discussed , the fraction of longitudinal @xmath29 polarization in @xmath34 , for which new measurements in two bins of momentum transfer to the lepton pair is available in case of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and compared them with the other approaches existed already in the literature @xcite . finally , we have used the same method to calculate the helicity fractions of @xmath1 in @xmath37 both in sm and in acd model .",
    "we hope that these fractions put another useful constraints on the universal extra dimension scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the effective hamiltonian for @xmath20 in acd model . in section 3",
    ", we will calculate the decay rate and forward backward asymmetry for @xmath0 .",

    "these wilson coefficients have been computed at next - to - next leading order ( nnlo ) in the sm @xcite . specifically for exclusive decays ,",

    "in acd  model the new physics comes through the wilson coefficients .",
    "buras et al .",
    "have computed the above coefficients at nlo in acd model including the effects of kk modes @xcite ; we use these results to study @xmath0 decay like the one done in the literature for @xmath51 @xcite . as it has already been mentioned that acd model is the minimal extension of sm with only one extra dimension and it has no extra operator other than the sm , therefore , the whole contribution from all the kk states is in the wilson coefficients , i.e. now they depend on the additional acd parameter , the inverse of compactification radius @xmath2 . at large value of @xmath6 the sm  phenomenology should be recovered , since the new states , being more and more massive , decoupled from the low - energy theory .",
