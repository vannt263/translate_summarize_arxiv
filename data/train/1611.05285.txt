    "the second painlev equation ( pii ) is the following second - order nonlinear differential equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant . when @xmath8 , this equation is called _ homogeneous pii _",
    ", otherwise it is called _",
    "inhomogeneous pii_. the pii equation , together with the other five ones , was first studied by painlev and his colleagues at the turn of twentieth century ; see more information about the painlev equation and the historical background in ince @xcite . in general ,",
    "these equations are irreducible , in the sense that they can not be solved in terms of elementary functions or known classical special functions ( airy , bessel , hypergeometric functions , etc . ) .",
    "moreover , their solutions , namely the _ painlev transcendents _ , satisfy the famous _",
    "painlev property _ : the only movable singularities are poles . here , ",
    "movable \" means that the location of singularities depends on initial conditions of the equation .",
    "although the study of the painlev equations originates from a purely mathematical point of view , they have found important applications in many areas of mathematical physics , such as random matrix theory , statistical physics , integrable continuous dynamical systems , nonlinear waves , 2d quantum gravity , etc .",
    "in addition , the painlev transcendents themselves also satisfy a lot of nice properties ; see the nice survey article clarkson @xcite and references therein .",
    "nowadays , the painlev transcendents are recognized as nonlinear special functions in the 21st century ; see the nist handbook @xcite .    in the study of the painlev equations ,",
    "one of the important topics is the asymptotic behaviour of their solutions .",
    "let us focus on pii , which is probably the most well studied one among the painlev family .",
    "denote the solution of pii by @xmath9 .",
    "it is well - known that the pii transcendents are meromorphic functions whose pole are all simple with residue @xmath10 ; for example see gromak , laine and shimomura ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) . in general",
    ", @xmath11 possesses infinitely many poles which are distributed in the complex @xmath12-plane ; see the nice numerical plots by fornberg and weideman @xcite .",
    "there also exist  tronque \" and  tri - tronque \" solutions whose poles are confined in some sectors when @xmath12 is large enough ; see joshi and mazzocco @xcite .",
    "if the solutions are pole - free on the real line , they usually have significant applications in mathematical physics . for these pole - free solutions ,",
    "it is important to study their asymptotic behaviors as @xmath2 and find out how these behaviours are related , i.e. the _ connection formulas_. for the homogeneous case @xmath13 , these solutions have been studied intensively in the literature .",
    "when @xmath13 , let us consider solutions of which decay as @xmath14 , that is , the solutions satisfy the following boundary condition @xmath15 with the above boundary condition , one can see that the term @xmath16 is small and negligible comparing with the other term @xmath17 .",
    "then , the equation is close to the airy equation @xmath18 when @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , hastings and mcleod @xcite proved the following results .    when @xmath19 , any solution of satisfying is asymptotic to @xmath20 , for some @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the airy function .",
    "conversely , for any @xmath21 , there is a unique solution which is asymptotic to @xmath20 as @xmath23 , for some @xmath21 .",
    "let us first consider the real solutions , i.e. , @xmath24 for real @xmath25 .",
    "it is well - known that , depending on the values of @xmath26 , there exist three classes of solutions for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "* ablowitz - segur(as ) solutions : @xmath27 . *",
    "+ the as solution @xmath30 is a one - parameter family of solutions of the homogeneous pii in .",
    "they are continuous on the real axis and possess the following asymptotic behaviours .",
    "@xmath31 where the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy the following connection formulas @xmath34    * hastings - mcleod(hm ) solutions : @xmath35 .",
    "* + the hm solution @xmath36 is the unique solution of the homogeneous pii in , which is continuous on the real axis and satisfies the following asymptotic behaviours @xmath37    when @xmath38 in , the oscillatory behavior as @xmath39 turns into the square root behavior @xmath40 . in the literature ,",
    "the hm solution given in and corresponds to the case when @xmath35 .",
    "one can easily get the solution for @xmath41 through the following symmetry relation @xmath42    * singular solutions : @xmath43 , @xmath26 . * + when @xmath43 , the solution @xmath44 is no longer pole - free on the real line and infinitely many poles appear on the negative real axis ; see the numerical plot in fornberg and weideman ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "these solutions satisfy the following asymptotic behaviours @xmath45 where @xmath25 is bounded away from the singularities appearing in the denominator . here , the constants @xmath46 and @xmath33 satisfy the following connection formulas @xmath47 besides the above cases where @xmath21 is real , the parameter @xmath21 could be complex , too . in the literature , people are also interested in the purely imaginary solutions , i.e. , @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "since the residues of all poles of pii transcendents are 1 or @xmath50 , the purely imaginary solution is pole - free for all @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , unlike the above three different cases for real @xmath21 , there is only one case when @xmath52 and the behavior of the solutions is similar to that of the real as solutions . here",
    ", we adopt the notation  @xmath53as \" for the purely imaginary case and hope this will not bring any confusion .",
    "* purely imaginary ablowitz - segur(@xmath53as ) solutions : @xmath54 .",
    "* + the @xmath53as solution @xmath55 is a one - parameter family of solutions of the homogeneous pii in with the following asymptotic behaviours @xmath56 where the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy the following connection formulas @xmath57 the beautiful formal expansions for the as solution in - and the hm solutions in - were derived by ablowitz and segur in @xcite and hastings and mcleod in @xcite , respectively .",
    "later , these results were justified rigorously in several different ways , for example , through gelfand - levitan type integral equations @xcite , the isomonodromy method @xcite , the deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method @xcite and a uniform approximation method @xcite .",
    "the singular asymptotics in - are relatively new comparing with the as and hm asymptotics .",
    "they were first derived by kapaev through the isomonodromy method in @xcite , and then proved again by bothner and its in @xcite with the deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method . for the purely imaginary case",
    ", the asymptotic expansions in - and the corresponding connection formulas - were also obtained by its and kapaev @xcite with the isomonodremy method and justified again by deift and zhou @xcite with the nonlinear steepest descent method .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the isomonodromy method and deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method are based on the riemann - hilbert(rh ) problem for the painlev equations ; see the rh problem for pii in section [ sec : rhp ] as an example .",
    "the rh problem originates from the pioneer work of flaschka and newell @xcite and jimbo , miwa and ueno @xcite , where they considered a system of linear ordinary differential equations with regular and irregular singular points .",
    "the main difference between these two methods is that certain prior assumptions on the asymptotics of the solutions are needed in the isomonodromy method .",
    "therefore , one may view the deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method as a direct method in the sense that it does not need any prior assumptions .",
    "recently , the transition asymptotics for the homogeneous pii was studied by bothner @xcite .",
    "the transition asymptotics describes how the asymptotic behavior of @xmath44 as @xmath39 changes from an oscillatory one ( ablowitz and segur ) to a power - like one ( hastings and mcleod ) , and then to a singular one ( kapaev ) when the parameter @xmath21 in varies . using the deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method",
    ", the author shows that the transition asymptotics are of boutroux type , i.e. , they are expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "although there is an extensive literature regarding the asymptotics for the homogeneous pii , the asymptotic results for the inhomogeneous pii are relatively fewer .",
    "when @xmath58 , if one also seeks a solution like which decay as @xmath14 , then we need to balance terms @xmath17 and @xmath59 in .",
    "that is , when @xmath58 , the solutions @xmath60 are no longer exponentially small , but tend to 0 like @xmath61 .",
    "then , to obtain real and purely imaginary solutions , the parameter @xmath59 is required to be real and purely imaginary , respectively .    for the real case ( @xmath62 ) , the inhomogeneous pii also possesses solutions which are similar to the as and hm solutions given in - . in this paper",
    ", we are going to prove the following results for @xmath63 rigorously .    [",

    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the rigorous proofs of the asymptotic behavior as @xmath39 , the connection formulas and , and the pole - free property of @xmath63 have never appeared in the literature . in this paper",
    ", we will derive the asymptotic results rigorously by using the deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method , and prove the pole - free property by establishing a vanishing lemma for the associated rh problems .",
    "similar to the homogeneous case , when @xmath74 , the oscillatory behavior as @xmath39 is replaced by the square root behavior @xmath75 .",
    "the solution with these boundary conditions is the so - called hm solution @xmath76 for the inhomogeneous pii in the literature .",
    "the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath76 have been obtained in its and kapaev @xcite and kapaev @xcite .",

    "this is similar to the singular solutions @xmath80 mentioned for the homogeneous pii .",

    "@xmath84 denote initial conditions that generate solutions with @xmath85 poles on @xmath86 , while curves and regions labeled @xmath87 represent @xmath85 poles on @xmath88 .",
    "one can see that , only when @xmath81 , the curve @xmath89 passes through the region @xmath90 , which indicates the initial conditions corresponding to @xmath63 .",
    "similar to the purely imaginary solutions @xmath55 in the homogeneous case , there also exist purely imaginary solutions @xmath91 when @xmath92 .",
