    "@xmath0 scan experiments have played an important role in the determination of the non - perturbative hadronic contribution to the running of the quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) fine structure constant , and to precise determination of electroweak measurements .",
    "the @xmath1-values , defined as the ratio of the total hadronic cross section to the @xmath2 cross section , have been measured by many collaborations either in @xmath0 scan experiments or in @xmath3 factories , over the effective center - of - mass energy region from the two pion threshold mass to the @xmath4 peak @xcite . in the tau - charm energy region from 2 to 5 gev , the @xmath5values measured at besii @xcite were used in the 2011 evaluation of @xmath6 and allowed its precision to be improved by about a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 experiments have also been used to study hadronic form factors , such as pion and nucleon form factors .",
    "the cross sections for a large number of exclusive processes have been measured over the range from @xmath7 to 5 gev @xcite . due to the strong coupling of vector mesons to the @xmath0 beam via a virtual photon , the lineshape of the vector resonance can also be measured with @xmath0 scan experiments .",
    "charmonium - like states , such as the @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite and so on , have been observed recently in @xmath0 colliders , and measurements of their decay modes , masses and widths are desirable .",
    "the @xmath10 state in particular , observed by besiii @xcite and then confirmed by the belle @xcite and cleo @xcite experiments , has stimulated a lot of theoretical discussion about its strange structure .",
    "an event generator which includes initial state radiation ( isr ) effects is indispensable to measure the cross section for a given exclusive decay . for low energy experiments , the isr effects and event generators",
    "are comprehensively reviewed in ref .",
    "experimentally , the born cross section is determined with the formula @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of signal events , @xmath13 is the luminosity of the data sample , and the detection efficiency @xmath14 multiplied by the isr correction factor ( @xmath15 ) is provided by the event generator .",
    "two popular event generators for this purpose are babayaga @xcite and phokhara @xcite , which give a high level of precision .",
    "phokhara can simulate the isr process at next - to - leading order accuracy with nine hadronic modes available .",
    "however , the original phokhara generator is designed for the isr return process with emission of a hard photon .",
    "the babayaga generator is designed for luminosity measurements with one additional hadronic mode , @xmath16 , available .",
    "event generation for hadronic decays in these two generators is based on the calculation of decay amplitudes with the input of hadron form factors .",
    "based on the requirements of @xmath0 scan experiments in the tau - charm region , we design an exclusive event generator with the isr effects up to the second order correction included .",
    "the accuracy achieved for the isr calculation can reach the level achieved by the kkmc generator .",
    "the total cross section is calculated using the experimental born cross sections convoluted with the radiator function , rather than by the calculation of the decay amplitude .",
    "this method facilitates the use of full experimental information , and avoids being constrained by the form factor calculation .",
    "this method is similar to that adopted in the measurement of charm production cross section in the @xmath0 scan experiment @xcite .",
    "in @xmath0 scan experiments , we consider measuring the born cross section ( @xmath17 ) for an exclusive process @xmath18 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , where @xmath19 denotes the hadron final states . due to the isr ,",
    "what the experiments directly measure is the observed cross section ( @xmath20 ) for the process @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the observed cross section is related to the born cross section by the quasi - real electron method @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the invariant mass of the final states ; @xmath24 is the full @xmath0 center - of - mass energy squared ; @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the isr photon energy and polar angle , respectively , in the @xmath0 center - of - mass frame . at the first order of qed calculation , the radiative function takes the form @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 which is the probability of isr photon emission for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath32 is the electron mass . if one performs integration over @xmath27 , the following energy dependence is obtained : @xmath33 where the radiative function takes @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the energy threshold value of a given decay , and @xmath37 . note that , to the first order accuracy of qed calculation , the cross section given in eq .",
    "( [ radxs ] ) is infrared divergent .",
    "it is therefore necessary to go beyond the first order calculation to sum all diagrams with soft multi - photon emission ; this procedure leads to soft - photon exponentiation . to calculate the finite - order leading logarithmic correction ,",
    "the structure function method is suggested in ref .",
    "this method yields the same factorized form ( [ radxs ] ) for the radiative photon emission cross section .",
    "up to order @xmath38 , the radiative function takes the form : @xmath39 - 4{\\ln(1-x)\\over x}-6+x\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 here the exponentiated part in eq .",
    "( [ secondrad ] ) accounts for soft multi - photon emission , while the remaining part takes into account hard collinear bremsstrahlung in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "we use the radiative function up to second order calculation to determine the cross section ; its accuracy is high enough for us to construct the event generator , though contributions from the @xmath38-order are known @xcite .",
    "the event generator is constructed using the observed cross section as given in eq .",
    "( [ radxs ] ) , and the integral is decomposed into two parts : @xmath41 where the threshold energy @xmath42 is the sum of masses for the final states , and the integral is cut apart at the point @xmath43 with an energy cut @xmath44 on the isr photon . in practice ,",
    "@xmath45 is set to the energy sensitivity of photon detection , for example , 25 mev for the besiii detector .",
    "it means that an isr photon within the range @xmath46 is too soft to be detected , so events within this energy region are generated with the isr photon suppressed . to simplify the calculation , born cross sections near the energy point @xmath47",
    "are assumed to be a constant value @xmath48 . using the relation @xmath49",
    ", the second integral can be further decomposed into two parts : @xmath50 with @xmath51 . using the radiative function given in eq .",
    "( [ secondrad ] ) , one has @xmath52 with spence s function @xmath53 .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) technique of acceptance - rejection method @xcite is used to generate events .",
    "first , an event with ( @xmath54 ) or without ( @xmath55 ) isr photons is sampled with the cross section @xmath56 and @xmath57 . a random number @xmath58",
    "is generated ; if the condition @xmath59 is true , then the generator produces an event of type @xmath60 , otherwise , produces an @xmath55-event .",
    "the decays of event type @xmath60 proceed via a further three steps :    * an unweighted event of the decay @xmath61 is generated within the uniform phase space with an invariant hadron mass @xmath62 .",
    "* a random number @xmath63 is then generated , and tested to see whether @xmath64 is true .",
    "if so , then the event is accepted ; otherwise , the event is rejected and the program goes back to step one . here",
    "@xmath65 is the maximum value of the observed cross section within the energy range from @xmath42 to @xmath66 . *",
    "the last step is to sample the isr photon polar angle according to eq .",
    "( [ angisr ] ) .",
    "a random number @xmath67 is generated and tested to check if @xmath68 is true ; if so , the event is accepted , and otherwise the event is rejected and the program goes back to step one . to avoid collinear divergence when",

    "@xmath71 is the maximum value of @xmath28 over this isr photon polar angle region .",
    "currently the generator includes seventy exclusive decays in total , with energy region covering a range from 0.3 gev up to about 6 gev .",

    "unfortunately , the information on the intermediate states and the angular distribution for the multibody decays are not available for the above processes .",

    "thus one can prove that the calculation of the factor product @xmath150 is irrelevant to the born cross section below the energy point where the isr photon can survive the event selection criteria .",

    "i.e. _ a few hundred mev , in the event selection . as per this argument",
    ", one concludes that the coverage of the born cross section in this model is wide enough to get the factor @xmath150 .",
    "the multibody decays are generated without considering the possible intermediate states and angular distributions in the generator .",
    "these can be further implemented within the framework of besevtgen , if the information is available in the data ( as explained in the manual @xcite ) . for the decay @xmath151",
