    "approximate computations_. the intended reader is a mathematician interested in _ numerical computations _ in algebraic geometry or number theory .",
    "the results concern fast algorithms in number theory and more precisely , fast computation of fourier coefficients of modular forms .",
    "these coefficients , with ramanujan s @xmath1-function as a typical example , have deep arithmetic significance and are important in various areas of mathematics , from number theory and algebraic geometry to combinatorics and lattices .",

    "the case of elliptic curves ( schoof s algorithm ) was at the birth of elliptic curve cryptography around 1985 .",
    "the results mentioned above give an algorithm for computing coefficients of modular forms in polynomial time .",
    "for example , ramanujan s @xmath2 with @xmath3 a prime number can be computed in time bounded by a fixed power of  @xmath4",
    ".    such fast computation of fourier coefficients is itself based on the main result of the book : the computation , in polynomial time , of galois representations over finite fields attached to modular forms by the langlands program .",
    "the computation of the galois representations uses their realisation , following shimura and deligne , in the torsion subgroup of jacobian varieties of modular curves .",
    "the main challenge is then to perform the necessary computations in time polynomial in the dimension of these nonlinear algebraic varieties .",

    "the probabilistic algorithm has a simpler proof than the deterministic one . and peter bruin @xcite has been able to generalize it to a much wider class of @xmath302-like modular spaces . finding a similar generalization for the deterministic algorithm is an open problem at this time .",
    "the main motivation for all the work done in @xcite is the application in number theory to the fast computation of coefficients of modular forms . instead of attempting to present this in the most general case we give two examples : ramanujan s @xmath1-function , and powers of jacobi s @xmath322-function .",
    "functions @xmath326 that are given by a power series @xmath327 with this symmetry under the action of @xmath250 on @xmath251 with the exponent @xmath328 replaced by an integer @xmath32 are called cuspidal modular forms of weight @xmath32 on @xmath250 .",
    "the complex vector spaces @xmath329 of cuspidal modular forms of weight @xmath32 are finite dimensional .",
    "the dimension grows roughly as  @xmath330 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath331 the space @xmath329 is zero , and @xmath332 is one - dimensional , generated by  @xmath325 .",
    "the fact that each @xmath11 in @xmath333 with @xmath334 acts on @xmath251 and normalises @xmath250 up to finite index leads to operators @xmath335 on the @xmath329 .",
    "these operators are named after hecke . for each integer",
    "@xmath336 there is an operator @xmath337 ; for @xmath312 prime it is the one induced by the matrix @xmath338 and for general @xmath312 it is a bit more complicated . as the space",
    "@xmath332 is one - dimensional , each @xmath339 acts on it as multiplication by a scalar .",
    "this scalar turns out to be the coefficient @xmath340 of @xmath341 in the power series of  @xmath325 .",
    "well known relations between the hecke operators imply relations between the @xmath340 that are summarised in the identity of dirichlet series , for @xmath342 in @xmath9 with real part @xmath343 large enough :            the identity of dirichlet series shows that for @xmath312 and @xmath297 with greatest common divisor @xmath5 we have @xmath345 , and that for @xmath3 prime and @xmath346 we have @xmath347 .",
    "therefore , the computation of @xmath340 is reduced to that of the @xmath2 for @xmath3 dividing  @xmath312 .",
    "we can now state one of the main theorems of @xcite .      before this result ,",
    "the fastest known algorithms to compute @xmath340 took time exponential in @xmath348 .",
    "for example , if one computes the product in ( [ eqn5.1 ] ) up to order @xmath312 by multiplying the necessary factors , then one spends time at least linear in  @xmath312 . to prove the theorem",
    ", it suffices to show that for @xmath3 prime @xmath2 can be computed in time polynomial in @xmath4 .",
    "this will be done using theorem  [ thmcompvl ] .",
    "the fact that modular forms have an enormous amount of symmetry as in ( [ eqn5.3 ] ) is certainly powerful , but it does not suffice at this point . what is needed is galois symmetry , which is also behind deligne s famous result mentioned above .",
    "a lot could be said on this , but this is not an appropriate place for that .    in a nutshell : modular forms give elements in de rham cohomology of complex algebraic varieties defined over @xmath247 , and the singular homology with torsion coefficients @xmath349 of those complex varieties can be defined algebraically ( grothendieck , artin , deligne ) and therefore has an action by  @xmath202 .",
    "for example , @xmath325 gives rise , for every prime integer @xmath350 , to a certain subgroup  @xmath302 of the @xmath57-torsion of the jacobian @xmath291 of @xmath7 .",
    "this subgroup @xmath302 has cardinality @xmath304 . for @xmath351 the image of @xmath2 in @xmath349",
    "is determined by the action of @xmath202 on this  @xmath302 . the addition map @xmath352 induces a @xmath247-algebra morphism called co - addition from @xmath305 to @xmath353 , that is , from @xmath203/(h_{f_\\ell})$ ] to @xmath354/(h_{f_\\ell}(t_1),h_{f_\\ell}(t_2))$ ] .",
    "computing @xmath2 modulo @xmath57 ( for @xmath355 ) is then done by reducing @xmath305 with its co - addition modulo @xmath3 and computing on this reduction @xmath356 a certain relation between the co - addition and the frobenius map that sends @xmath209 in @xmath356 to  @xmath357 , just as in schoof s algorithm for elliptic curves ( see section  1.2 of  @xcite ) . for more detail the interested reader is referred to section  2.4 of @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the point is that this advanced machinery can actually be used for computing @xmath358 in time polynomial in @xmath4 and @xmath57 .    in order to recover the actual value of @xmath2 as an integer ,",
    "we compute @xmath2 modulo several small primes @xmath57 .",
    "if the product of these small primes is bigger than @xmath359 then we deduce @xmath2 using inequality  ( [ eq : ineq ] ) and chinese remainder theorem @xcite .",
    "we now come to our second example : the classical question in how many ways a positive integer @xmath312 can be written as a sum of @xmath360 squares of integers .",
    "let us write @xmath361 for this number , that is , @xmath362 .",
    "then @xmath361 is the coefficient of @xmath341 in the formal power series  @xmath363 , with      the formal power series @xmath364 defines a holomorphic complex function on the complex upper half plane @xmath365 by viewing @xmath281 as the function @xmath366 .",
    "poisson s summation formula then shows that for all @xmath367 we have      where the square root is continuous and positive for @xmath253 in  @xmath368 . this functional equation for @xmath322 , together with the obvious one @xmath369 , imply that @xmath322 is a modular form of weight @xmath88 , and therefore that @xmath363 ( interpreted as a function on  @xmath251 ) is a modular form of weight  @xmath370 .",
    "this fact is the origin of many results concerning the numbers  @xmath361 .",
    "the famous explicit formulas for the @xmath361 for even @xmath371 up to @xmath372 due to jacobi , eisenstein and liouville ( see  @xcite and chapter  20 of  @xcite ) owe their existence to it . in order to state these formulas , let @xmath373 denote summation over the positive divisors @xmath371 of  @xmath297 , with the convention that there are no such @xmath371 if @xmath297 is not an integer , and let @xmath374 be the map that sends @xmath312 to @xmath87 if @xmath312 is even , to @xmath5 if @xmath312 is of the form @xmath375 and to @xmath376 if @xmath312 is of the form @xmath377",
    ". then we have : @xmath378,\\ , |d|^2=n}d^4 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last formula , @xmath379 $ ] is the set of gaussian integers @xmath380 in @xmath9 with @xmath209 and @xmath15 in  @xmath24 .    using these formulas ,",
    "the numbers @xmath361 for @xmath371 in @xmath381 can be computed in time polynomial in @xmath348 , if @xmath312 is given with its factorisation in prime numbers .",
    "this is not the case for the formulas that were found a bit later by glaisher for @xmath361 for some even @xmath382 .",
    "we give the formula that he found for @xmath383 , as interpreted by ramanujan :      computing @xmath289 by multiplying out the factors @xmath384 up to order @xmath312 takes time at least linear in @xmath312 , hence exponential in @xmath385 .",
    "we know of no direct way to compute the @xmath289 in time polynomial in @xmath348 , even if @xmath312 is given with its factorisation .",
    "however , @xmath386 is a modular form , and therefore we _ can _ compute @xmath289 in time polynomial in @xmath348 , if @xmath312 is given with its factorisation , _ via _ the computation of galois representations .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath361 for all even  @xmath371 .",
    "the explicit formulas for @xmath387 correspond precisely to the cases where the galois representations that occur are of dimension one , whereas for @xmath388 genuine two - dimensional galois representations always occur , as proved by ila varma in her master s thesis  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that from an algorithmic perspective the classical problem of computing the @xmath361 for even @xmath371 and @xmath312 given with its factorisation into primes is solved for _ all _ even  @xmath371 .",
    "the question as to the existence of _ formulas _ has a negative answer , but for _ computations _ this does not matter .      finally , we should point out that the algorithms in theorems  [ thmcompvl ] and  [ theorem : tau ] , despite their polynomial time complexity , are not so practical at present .",
    "however , bosman s computation of the @xmath302 associated with @xmath325 for @xmath57 in @xmath389 enabled him to further study lehmer s conjecture on the values of @xmath340 modulo @xmath312 .",
    "see lygeros and rozier  @xcite for a more classical experimental approach .",
