    "<S> we report a coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in five - layered compound hgba@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( hg-1245 ) with @xmath4 k , which is composed of two types of cuo@xmath0 planes in a unit cell ; three inner planes ( ip s ) and two outer planes ( op s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cu - nmr study has revealed that the optimallydoped op undergoes a superconducting ( sc ) transition at @xmath4 k , whereas the three underdoped ip s do an antiferromagnetic ( af ) transition below @xmath5 60 k with the cu moments of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus bulk superconductivity with a high value of @xmath4 k and a static af ordering at @xmath7 k are realized in the alternating af and sc layers . </S>",
    "<S> the af - spin polarization at the ip is found to induce the cu moments of @xmath8 at the sc op , which is the af proximity effect into the sc op . </S>"
