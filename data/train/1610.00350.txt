    "the @xmath1 scuti variables are a- or f - type main - sequence ( ms ) and post - ms stars .",
    "they are interesting asteroseismic targets as they are numerous and often show multi - periodic pressure mode pulsations .",
    "however , it is hard to determine their fundamental parameters , and their ubiquitous fast rotation makes this task even more difficult .",
    "those eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) with a component that is a @xmath1 scuti pulsator offer us the means to determine accurate masses and radii for these variables .",
    "however , systems with short orbital periods are more likely to be observed and these are also more likely to experience binary interactions .",
    "many @xmath1 scuti pulsating stars in algol - type ( oea ) systems were discovered from ground - bases photometry ( mkrtichian 2002 , 2003 ; soydugan et al .",

    "simple aperture photometry ( sap ) data ( data release 23 ) from the _ kepler _ satellite were retrieved from the mast archive .",
    "there are 18 quarters ( q0 - 17 ) of long cadence data and 1 quarter ( q4 ) of short cadence data .",
    "the aperture contamination is lower than @xmath21 in all quarters except for q12 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the light curve shows deep eclipses , ellipsoidal variations and coherent pulsations at frequency about @xmath23 d@xmath24 as apparent in the short cadence data .",
    "a sample of the short cadence light curve is shown in figure 1 . as the main pulsational frequency is well above the nyquist frequency ( @xmath25 d@xmath24 ) of long cadence data ( @xmath26 minutes sampling ) , these pulsations",
    "are essentially all cancelled out in the long cadence measurements .",
    "thus we used the long cadence data for binary light curve modeling and the light curve residuals of short cadence data for pulsational analysis .",
    "we also obtained 13 ground - based spectra of moderate resolving power ( @xmath27 ) from the r - c spectrograph on kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4-meter mayall telescope from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",

    "the procedures mentioned above are iterative , and in each step the templates and rvs were updated from previous determinations .",

    "the @xmath41 of the secondary matches the synchronized value very well . note that each pixel in our spectra is equal to @xmath53 km s@xmath24 in velocity space , and we can not reliably measure small rotational velocities ( @xmath54 km s@xmath24 ) . in figure 4 , we show the reconstructed component spectra of the two stars and the best matching model spectra .",
    "the mean flux ratio ( @xmath55 ) in the observed spectral range ( @xmath56  ) is @xmath57 which amounts to percentage contributions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",

    "the preparation of the raw data , which was detailed in guo et al .",

    "we divided the @xmath60 quarters into eight sections ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and fitted the light curve of each individually .",
    "the standard deviations of the best fitting parameters from these eight datasets are adopted as the final uncertainties .",

    "the effective temperature of the primary was fixed to the value from spectroscopy ( @xmath77 k ) as it is well known that the light curve is only sensitive to the temperature ratio .",
    "we assumed the binary has a circular orbit and the two components have synchronized rotation as indicated from spectroscopy .",
    "the parameters mass ratio ( @xmath78 ) , velocity semi - amplitude ( @xmath79 ) , and systemic velocity ( @xmath80 ) were fixed to values from spectroscopic orbital solutions as they have little affect on the light curve .",
    "the gravity brightening coefficients ( @xmath81 ) were fixed to the canonical values of @xmath82 for radiative atmospheres and @xmath83 for convective atmospheres .",
    "similarly , the surface bolometric albedos",
    "( @xmath84 were set to 1.0 and 0.5 for radiative and convective atmospheres , respectively .",
    "however , the light curve residuals from the parameter settings above still show obvious variations .",
    "we found that by setting @xmath85 as a free parameter the light curve fit is much better .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath85 is @xmath86 , which is much lower than the canonical value of @xmath87 .",
    "note matson et al .  ( 2016 ) also found a lower albedo ( @xmath88 ) for the f stars in kic  5738698 .",
    "if we let the albedo of the primary star ( @xmath89 ) vary , the best value is very close to @xmath90 , and the light curve fit is not improved .",
    "doppler boosting or beaming is a relativistic effect , in which the observer will receive a higher photon rate from a star moving towards him or her , and vice versa .",
    "the fractional change of photon rate is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is radial velocity of the star and @xmath93 is speed of light .",
    "thus , the key parameters are the mass and flux ratios .",
    "if the two stars have similar temperature , then the beaming effect will be canceled out if they have a mass ratio of @xmath94 . for systems with a very small mass ratio",
    ", the doppler beaming effect is expected to play an important role .",
    "a measurement of the beaming amplitude from the light curve can provide an independent estimation of the orbital parameters .",
    "this was performed in many beaming binaries such as koi-74 , koi-81 ( van kerkwijk et al .",

    "2012 ) . in the elc code",
    ", the doppler beaming effect is accounted for following the treatment in van kerkwijk et al .",
    "the beaming parameter @xmath95 is estimated as the wavelength average of @xmath96 in the _ kepler _ passband , where @xmath97 .",
    "the estimated values are @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the primary and secondary , respectively , and are fixed in the fitting process . in figure 5 , we show the best light curve solution and corresponding residuals with ( red ) and without ( green ) doppler beaming .",
    "it can be seen in the two middle panels that the residuals are more symmetric around the zero horizontal line if the beaming effect is included .",
    "we also show the elc model of the doppler beaming signal in the bottom panel , and the amplitude of the beaming effect is about @xmath100 magnitude .",
    "it is interesting to note that the photometric analogue of the spectroscopic rossiter - mclaughlin effect can be seen at phases @xmath101 ( groot 2012 ) .    in table 4",
    ", we list the final model parameters of kic  8262223 .",
    "the parameters of the primary are typical for a mid - a type zams star ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath49 k ) but somewhat over - luminous .",
    "the secondary has a very low mass ( @xmath2 ) and very discrepant radius ( @xmath3 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath102 k ) compared to main sequence stars of the same mass .",
    "this suggests that this system has gone through binary evolution with mass transfer .",
    "the implications and possible evolutionary scenarios are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the optimal effective temperature ratio ( @xmath103 ) from fitting the light curve is @xmath104 , and this gives @xmath102 k which is @xmath105 k ( @xmath106 ) cooler than that from spectroscopy ( @xmath107 k ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by our adopted lower albedo @xmath108 .",
    "there is a correlation between @xmath109 and bolometric albedo @xmath85 .",
    "if we fixed @xmath85 to the canonical value of @xmath110 , then the optimal @xmath103 value is much higher ( @xmath111 ) , which agrees well with the spectroscopic result .",
    "as we can not get a very good light curve fit with @xmath85 fixed to @xmath87 , we seem to have a dilemma . it is known that the bolometric albedo is difficult to pin point and is usually treated as a free parameter .",
    "sometimes even values as high as @xmath112 are used ( e.g. , star a in kic  10661783 ; lehmann et al .",
    "note that the effective temperature of kic  3858884 star b from spectroscopy by maceroni et al .",
    "( 2014 ) is also @xmath113 k different from that from the light curve solution .",
    "thus , we think this minor discrepancy is not an unexpected problem for our analysis .",
    "only the short cadence data can be used to study the pulsations of this system .",
    "we calculated the fourier spectrum of the light curve residuals with the _ period 04 _ package ( lenz & breger 2005 ) with all eclipses truncated .",
    "the calculation was performed to the short cadence nyquist frequency ( @xmath114 d@xmath24 ) with the fitting formula @xmath115 , where @xmath116 are the zero - point shift , pulsation amplitudes , linear frequencies and phases , respectively , and time @xmath117 bjd @xmath118 .",
    "no significant peaks were found beyond @xmath119 d@xmath24 .",
    "all frequencies with @xmath120 are reported in table 5 and the fourier spectrum is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the uncertainties were calculated following kallinger et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "almost all the pulsations are in the range of @xmath121 d@xmath24 .",
    "there appear to be some low amplitude peaks at @xmath122 d@xmath24 ( not shown in figure 6 ) which are exactly twice the main pulsation range .",
    "we interpret these peaks as the harmonics of the main pulsations rather than some high intrinsic pulsation frequencies .",
    "this indicates that the pulsations are to some extent non - sinusoidal .",
    "the primary star contributes much more light ( 83% in the wavelength range of our spectra ) , and its fundamental parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath49 k ) also agree with those of a typical @xmath1 scuti pulsator .",
    "it is , thus , very likely that the pulsations stem from the primary .",
    "the pulsations at @xmath121 d@xmath24 can be well explained as high order ( @xmath123 ) radial and non - radial p - modes .    in the low frequency region , there are two peaks @xmath124 d@xmath24 and @xmath125 d@xmath24 .",
    "@xmath126 is equal to twice of orbital frequency @xmath127 d@xmath24 within uncertainties and is likely the result of imperfect light curve fitting ( e.g. , ellipsoidal variations ) .",
    "@xmath128 is probably due to a low - frequency g - mode",
    ".    as the star is pulsating at relatively high radial orders , which are closer to the asymptotic regime , we can expect to find some frequency regularities similar to those observed in solar - like oscillators .",
    "garca hernndez et al .  (",
    "2015 ) found the signature of frequency regularities in six @xmath1 scuti stars in eclipsing binaries by analyzing the fourier transform ( ft ) of the p - mode frequencies .",
    "these frequency patterns are close to the large frequency separation which is related to the mean stellar density .",
    "we applied the same ft technique to the frequencies in table 5 , and the fourier spectrum is presented in figure 7 .",
    "the periodicity at @xmath129hz@xmath130 is related to the large frequency separation . from the mean density of the primary",
    ", we can deduce the expected large separation ( @xmath131 ) by using the linear relation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( surez et al .",
    "2014 ; garca hernndez et al .",
    "the expected @xmath131 is @xmath134 @xmath135hz , which is similar to but smaller than the observed value @xmath136 @xmath135hz .",
    "paparo et al .",
    "( 2016a , b ) found the signatures of the large frequency separation in @xmath137 @xmath1 scuti stars observed by _",
    "corot _ satellite , and except for showing regularities of @xmath138 , some of them show patterns which approximately agree with @xmath139 or @xmath140 . if we adopt the synchronous rotational frequency @xmath141hz , the corresponding rotational splittings for the high order p - modes are @xmath142 ( aerts et al .",
    "2010 ) , and @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 modes , respectively .",
    "we thus conclude that the observed pattern @xmath147 agrees with the theoretical large frequency separation with rotational effect taken into account .",
    "indeed , the highest peak in the fourier spectrum in figure 7 is at about @xmath148hz which is only slightly smaller than the orbital frequency @xmath149hz , and thus this regularity is likely the result of rotational splitting .    to check whether the pulsation range can be explained by the non - adiabatic theory , we modeled the evolution of some single non - rotating stellar models with mesa ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) and calculated their pulsation frequencies in the range of @xmath150 d@xmath24 with gyre ( townsend & teitler 2013 ) .",
    "we set the mixing length parameter @xmath151 to @xmath152 and used the opal opacity tables ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) .",
    "solar mixtures in grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) were adopted for the assumed solar composition .",
    "the results are presented in figure 8 .",
    "the pulsation modes ( @xmath153 ) from the equilibrium model with @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 are all stable ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "however , we note that the peak of the stability parameter @xmath159 ( the normalized growth - rate defined in stellingwerf 1978 ) is at @xmath160 d@xmath24 which roughly agrees with the observed unstable range @xmath121 d@xmath24 .",
    "note that modes from a similar but slightly less massive model with @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 can produce unstable p - modes ( positive @xmath159 ) in the range of @xmath163 d@xmath24 .",
    "we have to be cautious in interpreting the above analysis based on single star evolution , because the real inner structure of the @xmath1 scuti type primary may have different pulsational properties due to interior changes caused by the past mass transfer in the binary .",
    "our preliminary analysis of these post - mass transfer @xmath1 scuti stars suggests that they tend to be hotter and pulsate at higher frequencies than their single - evolution counterparts .",

    ", these systems can pulsate at low ( @xmath195 d@xmath24 ) as well as high frequencies ( @xmath196 d@xmath24 ) .",
    "it is known that the unstable range of pulsations will vary as the star evolves off the zams .",
    "for example , for a @xmath1 scuti star with @xmath197 , the @xmath198-modes @xmath199 ( @xmath200 d@xmath24 ) are unstable for young models close to zams .",
    "the unstable range moves to @xmath201 d@xmath24 for models near tams which are low order p - modes or g - modes ( dupret 2002 ) .",
    "asteroseismology has the potential of determining the ages of the @xmath1 scuti pulsators in these el cvn binaries . not only the dwarfs , but the pre - he wd precursor can also show pulsations .",

    "utilizing the accurate _ kepler _ photometric data and our ground - based spectroscopic data , we determined the fundamental parameters of kic  8262223 , an eclipsing binary system with an orbital period of @xmath203 days which contains an a - type dwarf and a low mass pre - he wd . the light curves show high frequency pulsations at about @xmath204 d@xmath24 .",
    "these @xmath1 scuti type pulsations are likely from the primary star and can be explained as radial and non - radial p - modes .",
    "we discussed possible evolutionary scenarios and showed that this system and several other very similar binaries can be explained by the non - conservative evolution of close binaries with low mass progenitors , the channel that forms el cvn type stars .",

    "a future spectroscopic follow up covering the full orbit could help pin point accurate masses and rotational alignment .",
    "asteroseismic modeling has not yet been applied to @xmath1 scuti stars in pulsating algols ( oeas ) due to the complex nature of these systems . as a prerequisite",
    ", it is possible to identify the pulsation modes through high cadence and high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the eclipse mapping method ( reed et al .",
