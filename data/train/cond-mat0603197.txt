    "one of the main properties of solitons , making them to be of special interest for physical applications , is preserving their localized shapes during evolution and mutual interactions  @xcite . due to this",
    "robustness solitons can be regarded as quasiparticles and systems possessing large number of such excitations can be described in terms of the distribution function governed by the kinetic equation  @xcite .    in the mean - field theory  @xcite description of the quasi - one - dimension homogeneous bose gas",
    "is reduced to the exactly integrable nonlinear shrdinger ( nls ) [ or one - dimensional ( 1d ) gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) ] equation , and therefore solitons are expected to play a prominent role in the dynamical and statistical properties of low - dimensional condensates .",
    "when interatomic interactions are repulsive , the gp equation possesses dark ( or grey ) soliton solutions  @xcite .",
    "existence of the dark solitons was confirmed by a number of recent experiments with bec s confined by elongated traps  @xcite .    in practice , condensates appear to be never homogeneous , and therefore effect of external potentials on the dark - soliton dynamics is a subject of special interest ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an inhomogeneity of a system by itself does not invalid possibilities of description of solitons as quasiparticles ( in some approximation , of course ) .",
    "in particular , one can explore hamiltonian approach to an effective particle with one degree of freedom , instead of dealing with the original equation for the macroscopic wave function , which is a system with infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , one can extend the respective description on the gas of solitons , which now will be described by a distribution function governed either by fokker - planck equation ( for the case where a soliton bearing system interacts with a thermal bath , see e.g.  @xcite ) or by a kinetic equation with respective collision integral , as this is shown in  @xcite for the case of interaction of solitons with a noncondensed atoms .",
    "a quasiparticle description of dark solitons can be obtained from the perturbation theory in adiabatic approximation  @xcite ( sometimes called the collective variable approach ) . at the same time , as was shown in  @xcite , a concept of a quasiparticle naturally emerges from the landau theory of superfluidity and can be justified on the basis of the mean field theory within the framework of the _ local density approximation_. it turns out , that a dark soliton moves in an external potential without deformation of its density profile as a particle of mass 2@xmath2 .",
    "the local density approximation is rather general , allowing direct extension to other nonlinear equations , related to the bec dynamics , as well as to various ( non - parabolic ) types of the trap potential .",
    "building up such a generalized theory is the main goal of the present paper .    in real experimental conditions",
    "the external trap potential can depend not only on coordinate , but also on time .",
    "that is why the second aim of the present work is the description of the effect of adiabatic time - dependence of the external parameters on the dark soliton motion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with the dynamics of a dark soliton in an adiabatically changing parabolic trap ( sec .",
    "[ sec : darksoliton ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalapproach ] , we develop our hamiltonian theory for solitons described by generalized polynomial nls equations and show how such approach is related to the mean field approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] we consider in detail examples of dark soliton dynamics , which include the cases of non - parabolic trap and models with higher nonlinearity .",
    "the consideration is provided within the framework of the local density approximation and is verified by direct numerical simulations of the dark soliton dynamics . in this section",
    "we also show how one can modify the perturbation theory for dark solitons to take into account adiabatic change of the trap frequency ( sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbed ] ) and make comments on the dynamics of small amplitude dark solitons ( sec .  [",
    "sec : smallamp ] ) .",
    "the outcomes are summarized in the conclusion and technical details of some calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "let us start with the dynamics of a dark soliton described by the gp equation @xmath3 here @xmath4 , @xmath5 is s - wave scattering length and @xmath6 the transverse linear oscillator length , which describes the bec in an elongated trap at low densities  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for the details of derivation by means of the multiple scale expansion method ) .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the details below sec .  [",
    "sec : generalapproach ] ) that the dark soliton dynamics in a parabolic trap can be successfully described within the framework of the local density approximation .",
    "this means that , in spite of the presence of the trap , one starts with the solution of the 1d homogeneous ( i.e. when @xmath7 ) gp equation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ,  5.5 ) : @xmath8 \\right )    \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the velocity of the soliton , @xmath11 is the unperturbed linear density , @xmath12 is the speed of sound and @xmath13 is the width of the soliton",
    ". then the influence of the trap is accounted by considering a general function @xmath14 which dependence on time is to be obtained .    the energy of the system can be defined as @xmath15dx \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath18 is the key point of the local density approximation : the sound velocity is substituted by its local value computed in the point where the center of the soliton is located . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation ,",
    "when the atomic density is given by @xmath19 , one has @xmath20 with @xmath21 . substituting @xmath22 in ( [ disp_rel ] ) ,",
    "the energy conservation can be rewritten as follows  @xcite @xmath23 here we introduced the effective mass of the soliton considered as a quasiparticle @xmath24 the frequency of the soliton oscillations @xmath25  @xcite and the effective soliton energy @xmath26 which , altogether with @xmath27 , is a constant of motion .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations governed by ( [ final ] ) is @xmath28    one of the characteristic features of the introduced quasiparticles is that their dynamics is determined not only by their local properties ( velocity and amplitude ) but also by the environment , i.e. by the unperturbed density . as a result",
    "any change of the trap characteristics ( say , trap frequency or geometry ) will affect solitons not only by changing the domain of their motion but also through the change of the density .",
    "it turns out that the local density approximation is a suitable framework for description of mentioned phenomena in the case when time variation of the parameters of the system is slow enough .    according to a general law of the hamiltonian mechanics , the adiabatic invariant @xmath29 stays constant  @xcite .",
    "time dependence of the amplitude of oscillation can be defined from this condition . the canonical momentum , which enters in ( [ aiint ] ) , can be computed explicitly using the formula @xmath30 what gives @xmath31 it turns out , however , for calculation of the adiabatic invariant it is more convenient to use the general equation between @xmath32 and the frequency of oscillations : @xmath33    taking into account that @xmath25 does not depend on @xmath27 and using an obvious boundary condition @xmath34 at @xmath35 , we easily find a simple equation @xmath36 it is not difficult to show ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( 17.10 ) in @xcite ) , that in the tf approximation one has @xmath37so the second term on r.h.s . of ( [ i_dark ] )",
    "is constant .    thus preserving the adiabatic integral in an adiabatic process implies preserving @xmath38 , what in the case of slowly varying frequency implies @xmath39 .",
    "taking again into account that according ( [ c0 ] ) in the tf approximation @xmath40 , one deduces from ( [ e0 ] ) that @xmath41 .",
    "finally , the scaling law for the amplitude of oscillations , defined by ( [ x0 ] ) , reads @xmath42    it is worth to underline that this law is different that one for a conventional harmonic oscillator , where @xmath43 even though the motion of the soliton is pure harmonic .",
    "the point is that in our case the ratio @xmath38 , but not @xmath44 , is preserved .",
    "an important feature of the soliton dynamics is that in the case at hand the soliton frequency does not depend on the energy .",
    "hence the frequency of the soliton oscillations does not depend on the amplitude of the soliton , what corroborates with the analysis of the oscillations of the small - amplitude solitons [ see ( [ om_small_amp ] ) below and subsequent discussion ] as well with the earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "we have checked the obtained predictions , made on the basis of the local density approximation , numerically .",
    "the typical results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the local density approximation essentially uses that the background of the condensate is static , i.e. that the dark soliton motion does not excite the motion of the whole condensate . in practice , due to finiteness of the system , such a supposition strictly speaking",
    "does not hold , and the whole condensate also undergoes oscillations with the frequency of the condensate @xmath45 , what follows directly from the ehrenfest theorem .",
    "the difference of the frequencies of the condensate and of the dark soliton , i.e. between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , results in the beating of the dark soliton  @xcite , which are clearly observable in fig .",
    "respectively , one can identify the two slopes corresponding to the maxima and to the minima of the soliton amplitudes .",
    "we will use the subindexes `` @xmath47 '' and `` @xmath48 '' for the respective quantities . in other words , each of the results presented in panels ( a )  ( c ) and ( e )  ( g ) is characterized by the two scaling laws : @xmath49 shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a),(e ) . the exponents @xmath50 are different ( although their difference is relatively small ) , what requires a definition of some averaged exponent @xmath1 which could be compared with the theoretical predictions .",
    "we obtain such exponent numerically from the dynamics of the averaged amplitude , i.e. using the formula @xmath51 summary of the results for the averaged exponent @xmath1 are presented in panels ( d ) and ( h ) . as one can see from the figures the law of the change of the amplitude of soliton oscillations stays close to the predicted law @xmath52 for relatively slow solitons and relatively large densities .",
    "meantime deviations are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( e ) . in the last case the exponent @xmath1 is essentially less than the predicted in our analytical consideration .",
    "it turns out , however that the mentioned deviation from @xmath53 law is observed for small densities .",
    "this is natural from point of view of the theory . indeed , our consideration was based on the tf approximation for the atomic density , when @xmath54 .",
    "this approximation fails at low densities , and must be substituted by the gaussian distribution , where @xmath55 .",
    "then by repeating the above our arguments for the gaussian distribution , instead if the tf one , one finds @xmath56 i.e. the law of the dependence of the amplitude of oscillation of the conventional linear oscillator on the frequency , what corroborates with the numerical findings .",
    "the theory developed in the previous section can be generalized for nls equation with arbitrary power - law nonlinearity and non - parabolic potential .",
    "more specifically , in the present section we consider the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a positive integer and @xmath59 , which describes interacting particles of mass @xmath2 in an external potential @xmath60 .",
    "the exponent @xmath58 characterizes the effective inter - particle interactions .",
    "in particular when @xmath61 and @xmath62 one recovers the gp equation ( [ nls_gp ] ) considered in the previous section .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath63 introduced in ( [ gp ] ) is determined by the link valid for a homogeneous condensate : @xmath64 .",
    "thus the sound speed @xmath65 connected to the chemical potential by the relation @xmath66 can be expressed as follows @xmath67    there are several reasons to consider more general equation ( [ gp ] ) .",
    "first of all , equation ( [ nls_gp ] ) , being completely integrable , possesses very specific soliton properties .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the soliton dynamics in a more general situation .",
    "the case of @xmath68 is particularly important , because corresponding equation can be used in different physical problem .",
    "such a situation can take place near the feshbach resonance . in this case",
    "the s - wave scattering length depends on magnetic field as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the background value of the scattering length , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the location and width of the resonance .",
    "if magnetic field is equal to @xmath73 , the scattering length turns to zero and the dominant interaction among atoms is due to three - body effects .    indeed ,",

    "coefficient @xmath78 depends on three - body interactions and can not be calculated explicitly .",
    "however , it stays finite for @xmath79 , while three first terms disappear , giving @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the non - linear term in the mean - field equation has form @xmath81 .",
    "the sign of @xmath78 can not be defined from general considerations .",
    "we assume that @xmath82 . after averaging with respect to the transverse motion we obtain ( [ gp ] ) with @xmath68 and @xmath83 .",
    "another physical system where the equation of the state with @xmath68 is valid , is an 1d bose gas in so - called tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit of inpenetrable particles .",
    "this limit can be achieved for a gas of small density .",
    "it has been shown by girardeau that there exists an exact mapping between states of this system and an _ ideal _ 1d fermi gas .",
    "in particular in this case one has @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "it has also been rigorously shown that one can find density distribution of a such gas in a 1d trap by minimization of the energy functional  @xcite @xmath86^{2}+\\frac{g}{3}n^3   + u(x)n \\right]dx\\ , .",

    "[ 18 ] suggested to use equation ( 19 ) for dynamics of the tg gas .",
    "however , the hydrodynamic - like equation ( 19 ) can not give a satisfactory description of dynamics of an ideal fermi gas .",
    "nevertheless it can be useful for a bose gas near the tg limit , where equation of state approximately follows the @xmath68 law , but dynamic is still not an ideal gas - type .",
    "let us consider now a condensate in the absence of external field , @xmath87 .",
    "( [ gp ] ) takes the form @xmath88 and is subject to the finite density boundary conditions : @xmath89 where the constant @xmath90 can be considered without restriction of generality in the interval @xmath91 $ ] : @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "then dark solitons , @xmath93 , will be associated with traveling wave solutions , characterized by the following dependence of the density on the spatial coordinate and time : latexmath:[\\ ] ] formula ( [ energy_v ] ) follows from the last equality .",
