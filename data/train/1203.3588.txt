    "@xmath5 , defined below : @xmath20 bipartite graphs of degree @xmath3 , diameter @xmath4 and order @xmath5 are called _ bipartite moore graphs_. bipartite moore graphs are very scarce ; when @xmath21 and @xmath22 they may only exist for @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has also turned out to be very difficult to determine @xmath2 even for particular instances ; in fact , with the exception of @xmath25 settled in @xcite , the other known values of @xmath2 are those for which a bipartite moore graph is known to exist .",
    "research in this area falls then into two main directions . on one hand , the efforts to improve the upper bounds for @xmath2 by studying the existence or otherwise of bipartite graphs of maximum degree @xmath3 , diameter @xmath4 and order @xmath26 for small @xmath27 ( that is , bipartite @xmath28-graphs , where the parameter @xmath29 is called the _ defect _ ) . on the other hand , the studies to improve the lower bounds for @xmath2 by constructing ever larger bipartite graphs with given maximum degree and diameter . in spite of these efforts and the wide range of techniques and approaches used to tackle these problems ( see @xcite ) , in most cases there is still a significant gap between the current lower and upper bound for @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of bipartite graphs of diameter @xmath16 , and present some modest contributions in both directions . when @xmath30 there is a bipartite moore graph whenever @xmath31 is a prime power ( namely , the incidence graphs of projective planes ) ; however , there is no moore bipartite graph of diameter @xmath16 for @xmath32 ( @xcite ) or @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of moore bipartite graphs of diameter @xmath16 for other degrees remains an open problem .",
    "in @xcite the authors proved that bipartite @xmath34-graphs may only exist for certain values of @xmath3 ; in particular , they do not exist for @xmath32 .",
    "the results and ideas exposed here are , in a great extent , a continuation of the precursory work initiated in @xcite .",
    "we provide structural properties for bipartite @xmath9-graphs and , most important , prove the non - existence of bipartite @xmath10-graphs .",
    "such outcome implies that the only known bipartite @xmath11-graph  found by paul hafner and independently by eyal loz ( @xcite )  is optimal , and therefore @xmath12 .",
    "this is just the second value settled for @xmath2 other than a bipartite moore bound .",
    "our approach can also be used to show the uniqueness of the known bipartite @xmath13-graph , as well as the non - existence of bipartite @xmath14-graphs .",
    "finally , we also find three largest known bipartite ( and vertex - transitive ) graphs of degree @xmath15 and diameter @xmath16 .",
    "this settles @xmath35 , which improves by @xmath18 vertices the previous lower bound for @xmath19 .",
    "adjacency lists of these graphs are available at http://guillermo.com.au/wiki/list_of_publications under the name of this paper .",
    "we conclude this introduction by depicting all the known bipartite @xmath9 graphs .",
