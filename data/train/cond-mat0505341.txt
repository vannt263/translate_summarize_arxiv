    "a conventional band theory is based on the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and on the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite within dft . in spite of great success of the lda for conventional metallic systems it appears to be inadequate for strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) .",
    "for instance , lda predicts la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 to be a metal whereas , in reality , it is an insulator .",
    "several approaches to include strong correlations in the lda method are known , for example lda+u @xcite and lda - sic @xcite .",
    "both methods result in the correct antiferromagnetic insulator ground state for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 contrary to lda , but the origin of the insulating gap is not correct .",
    "it is formed by the local single - electron states splitted by spin or orbital polarization . in these approaches the paramagnetic phase of the undoped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( above the neel temperature @xmath2 ) will be metallic in spite of strong correlation regime @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hubbard coulomb parameter@xcite and @xmath5 is a free electron bandwidth .",
    "the spectral weight redistribution between hubbard subbands is very important effect in sces that is related to the formation of the mott - hubbard gap in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "this effect is incorporated in the hybrid lda+dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) ( for review see ref.@xcite ) and lda++ approaches .",
    "@xcite the electron self - energy in lda+dmft approach is calculated by the dmft theory in the limit of infinite dimension @xcite and is * k*-independent , @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite that is why the correct band dispersion and the arpes data for high-@xmath7 compounds can not be obtained within lda+dmft theory .",
    "recent development of the lda+cluster dmft method @xcite and spectral density functional theory @xcite gives some hopes that non - local corrections may be included in this scheme .",
    "a generalized tight - binding ( gtb ) @xcite method has been proposed to study the electronic structure of sces as a generalization of hubbard ideas for the realistic multiband hubbard - like models .",
    "the gtb method combines the exact diagonalization of the intracell part of the hamiltonian , construction of the hubbard operators on the basis of the exact intracell multielectron eigenstates , and the perturbation treatment of the intercell hoppings and interactions . a similar approach to the 3-band @xmath8 model of cuprates @xcite",
    "is known as the cell perturbation method .",
    "@xcite the practical realization of the gtb method for cuprates required an explicit construction of the wannier functions to overcome the nonorthogonality of the oxygen molecular orbitals at the neighboring @xmath9 cells .",
    "@xcite the gtb calculations for undoped and underdoped cuprates are in good agreement with arpes data both in the dispersion of the valence band and in the spectral intensity .",
    "@xcite a strong redistribution of spectral weight with hole doping and the formation of the in - gap states have been obtained in these calculations .",
    "similar gtb calculations for the manganites has been done recently .",
    "@xcite    as any model hamiltonian approach the gtb method is not _",
    "ab initio _",
    ", there are many hamiltonian parameters like intraatomic energy levels of @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons , various @xmath8 and @xmath12 hopping parameters , coulomb and exchange interaction parameters .",
    "these parameters have been obtained by fitting the set of optical , magnetic @xcite and arpes @xcite data .",
    "generally the question arises how unique the set of parameters is . to overcome this restriction we have proposed in this paper a novel lda+gtb scheme that allows to calculate the gtb parameters by the _ ab initio _",
    "lda approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_lda_par ] the construction of wannier functions from self - consistent lda eigenfunctions as well as _",
    "ab initio _ parameters of the multiband @xmath8 model for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 are given .",

    "to obtain hopping integrals for different sets of bands included in consideration we apply projection procedure using wannier functions ( wfs ) formalism .",
    "@xcite wfs were first introduced in 1937 by wannier @xcite as fourier transformation of bloch states @xmath14 @xmath15 where * t * is lattice translation vector , @xmath16 is the number of discrete @xmath17 points in the first brillouin zone and @xmath18 is band index .",
    "one major reason why the wfs have seen little practical use in solid - state applications is their nonuniqueness since for a certain set of bands any orthogonal linear combination of bloch functions @xmath14 can be used in ( [ wf_psi_def ] ) .",
    "therefore to define them one needs an additional constraint . among others",
    "marzari and vanderbilt @xcite proposed the condition of maximum localization for wfs , resulting in a variational procedure . to get a good initial guess authors of ref .",
    "proposed to choose a set of localized trial functions @xmath19 and project them onto the bloch states @xmath14 .",
    "it was found that this starting guess is usually quite good .",
    "this fact later led to the simplified calculating scheme @xcite where the variational procedure was abandoned as in present work and the result of the aforementioned projection was considered as the final step .      to construct the wfs one should to define a set of trial orbitals @xmath19 and choose the bloch functions of interest by band indexes ( n@xmath20 ,  , n@xmath0 ) or by energy interval ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "non - orthogonalized wfs in reciprocal @xmath22 space are then the projection of the set of site - centered atomic - like trial orbitals @xmath19 on the bloch functions @xmath14 of the chosen bands : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the band dispersion of @xmath18-th band obtained from self - consistent _ ab initio _ lda calculation . in present work",
    "we use lmt - orbitals @xcite as trial functions .",
    "the bloch functions in lmto basis are defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the combined index representing @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the atomic number in the unit cell , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are orbital and magnetic quantum numbers ) , @xmath31 are the bloch sums of the basis orbitals @xmath32 @xmath33 and the coefficients are @xmath34 since in present work @xmath19 is an orthogonal lmto basis set orbital ( in other words @xmath35 in @xmath19 corresponds to the particular @xmath27 combination ) , then @xmath36 .",
    "hence @xmath37 in order to orthonormalize the wfs ( [ wf ] ) one needs to calculate the overlap matrix @xmath38 @xmath39 then its inverse square root @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 in the derivation of ( [ o - s ] ) the orthogonality of bloch states @xmath42 was used .    from ( [ wf ] ) and ( [ ss ] ) , the orthonormalized wfs in @xmath17-space @xmath43 can be obtained as @xmath44 then the matrix element of the hamiltonian @xmath45 in reciprocal space is @xmath46 hamiltonian matrix element in real space is @xmath47 here atom @xmath48 is shifted from its position in the primary unit cell by a translation vector @xmath49 . for more detailed description of this procedure",

    "the valence band have bandwidth about 6 ev and consists of a set of very narrow subbands with the highest one at the top of the valence band - the so - called `` zhang - rice singlet '' subband .",
    "the dominant spectral weight in the singlet band stems from the oxygen @xmath10-states , while for the bottom of the empty conductivity band it is from @xmath50-states of copper .",

    "this results in smaller width of the singlet band for the lsco compared to the ncco : about 0.5 ev and 1 ev correspondingly .",
    "however , for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 minor discrepancies occurs in the dispersion of the bottom of the conductivity band near @xmath78 point obtained by gtb with phenomenological set of parameters and by lda+gtb .",
    "this leads to the different character of the optical absorption edge in two presented methods .",
    "the absorption edge for the lda+gtb is formed by the indirect transitions in contrast to the gtb method with phenomenological set of parameters , where the momentum of excited quasiparticle is conserved by optical transition at the absorption edge . for nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 both gtb method with fitting parameters and lda+gtb result in the conductivity band minima at the @xmath78 point ( see fig .  [ fig_compare_bands_n ] ) .",
    "also , in the lda+gtb method the triplet band dispersion and the singlet - triplet hybridization are much smaller then in the gtb method with fitting parameters .",
    "this happens mainly due to the smaller values of @xmath79 used in lda+gtb method , because it is this microscopic parameter that gives main numerical contribution ( see eqs .",

    "so , despite some minor discrepancies , both gtb method with phenomenological parameters and lda+gtb method without free parameters gives similar band dispersion .",
    "next topic that we will discuss in connection to the lda+gtb method is the value of magnetic moment on copper @xmath82 . from the neutron diffraction studies of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite and yba@xmath0cu@xmath83o@xmath61",
    "@xcite it is known that @xmath82 is equal to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is bohr magneton .",
    "there are two reasons of why @xmath86 is different from the free atomic value @xmath87 in @xmath88 cu@xmath89 , namely zero temperature quantum spin fluctuations and the covalent effect . since each oxygen have two neighboring coppers belonging to different magnetic sublattices the total moment on oxygen is equal to zero . but due to @xmath8 hybridization the @xmath10-states of oxygen are partially filled so these orbitals could carry non - zero magnetic moment @xmath90 , while total moment on oxygen will be equal to zero .",
    "such space distribution of magnetic moment leads to the difference @xcite between experimentally observed antiferromagnetic form - factor for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and the heisenberg form - factor of cu@xmath89 .",
    "in order to take into account covalent effects and zero quantum fluctuations on equal footing we will write down the expression for @xmath86 : @xmath91 where zero quantum spin fluctuations are contained in @xmath92 and covalent effects are described by the weight @xmath93 of the @xmath94 configuration .",
