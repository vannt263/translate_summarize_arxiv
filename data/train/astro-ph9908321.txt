    "soon after the discovery of cosmologically distant objects it was realised ( field 1959 ) that the absence of strong lyman alpha scattering of light at the appropriate redshifted wavelengths placed strong constraints on the amount of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( shklovskij 1964 ; scheuer 1965 ; gunn & peterson 1965 ) . the absence of significant neutral opacity in a uniformly distributed component of the igm is generally referred to as the gunn - peterson effect .",
    "while it remains conceptually possible that there is a diffuse substrate of the igm in a multi - phase gas , modern interpretations of the ly@xmath9  forest of neutral hydrogen absorption lines suggest instead that the igm is a highly structured warm ionized gas in which the amplitude of the perturbations grows gravitationally . in this interpretation the ly@xmath9  forest is produced by scattering from the very small neutral hydrogen fraction of this undulating density intergalactic gas ( e.g. , cen et  al .",
    "1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ) . regions of minimum optical depth , in this scenario , occur in cosmic mini - voids , which are underdense expanding regions where growth is essentially frozen ( meiksin 1994 ; reisenegger & miralda - escud 1995 ) . the cosmic mini - voids are the closest analogs in this model to the gunn - peterson effect in a homogeneous diffuse gas , and the simple physics of these regions makes them powerful probes of the metagalactic ionizing flux relative to the baryon density of the universe .    because of the rapid increase in the gas density with redshift",
    ", it is expected that the fraction of the quasar spectrum returning to the continuum level will diminish rapidly at the higher redshifts . as a specific example , zhang et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) find , at @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , @xmath12  and a haardt - madau ( 1996 ) spectrum and ionizing flux , that less than a fraction of a percent of the spectrum will have @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , they find that the spectrum of a @xmath10  quasar will have an average flux in the region between @xmath14    and @xmath15    that is 10% of the continuum value which would be present in the absence of lyman alpha scattering .    the newly discovered @xmath10  quasar j033829.31 + 002156.3 ( fan et  al .",
    "1999 ) presents an opportunity to look at this question at the highest redshift yet available , and we report here low and high resolution spectral observations of this object . as schneider , schmidt , & gunn ( 1991b ) found in the @xmath16quasar pc1247",
    "+ 3406 , @xmath17  ( the oke index @xmath3  is defined in  3 ) is higher than the model values ( 0.25 in j033829.31 + 002156.3 and 0.36 in pc1247 + 3406 ) and we also find that there are significant regions of low optical depth ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "our results are similar to the minimum optical depth of @xmath19 at @xmath20 found in the @xmath21 quasar br12020725 by ( 1994 ) and to the @xmath22 lower limit of 0.1 found by williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the @xmath23 quasar br10330327 .",
    "both the oke index and the low minimum opacity require a relatively high ionizing flux at these redshifts .",
    "long - slit spectroscopic observations of j033829.31 + 002156.3 were obtained with lris ( oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) on ut 10 feb 1999 with a @xmath24 wide slit and @xmath25/mm grating blazed at 8500   ( spectral resolution 8.1  ) , and on ut 17 feb 1999 with a @xmath26 wide slit , with both the @xmath25/mm grating blazed at 8500   ( spectral resolution 12.3  ) , and with the @xmath27/mm grating blazed at 5000   ( spectral resolution 17.3  ) .",
    "seeing was @xmath28 fwhm on the first night , and @xmath29 on the second night ; observations were made under dark , photometric conditions in each instance .",
    "a sequence of three exposures , shifted by 10@xmath30 along the slit , was taken in each configuration with the position angle of the slit set to the parallactic angle for the middle exposure .",
    "this yielded net integrations of 3600 s ( 55429350  ; 8.1   resolution ; @xmath24 slit ) , 3600 s ( 57999609  ; 12.4   resolution ; @xmath26 slit ) , and 3000 s ( 36738708  ; 17.3   resolution ; @xmath26 slit ) .",
    "a gg495 blocking filter was used to suppress second order blue light .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "calibration stars ( hz4 and hz44 ) were observed at the parallactic angle for each slit / grating configuration and used to flux calibrate the data .",
    "the calibration stars used for the lris and hires data are category 1 hst standard stars ( bohlin & lindler 1992 ) , which are part of an ongoing effort to develop a consistent set of fundamental flux standards for observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ over the wavelength region from 105010000   based on the oke ( 1990 ) measurements taken on the double spectrograph of the palomar 5-m telescope for optical measurements . although both hz4 and hz44 have long - wavelength flux calibration data measured by a variety of authors ( e.g. , oke 1974 ; stone 1977 ; massey & gronwall 1990 ) , for self - consistency we use the oke ( 1974 , 1990 ) measurements .",
    "the estimated galactic extinction is @xmath31 = 0.10 in this direction ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .    the hires ( vogt et  al .",
    "1994 ) observations were obtained using the red collimator and the d1 decker ( @xmath32 slit ; resolution @xmath2 ) on the nights of ut 14 and 15 feb 1999 under conditions of variable seeing .",
    "the four 2400 s exposures were taken at @xmath33 ( non - parallactic angle ) using the atmospheric dispersion corrector to maintain the guide object for this observation within the guide camera field .",
    "the white dwarf standard star g191-b2b ( oke 1990 ) was used to correct the continuum fit , which was then flux - calibrated by comparing an appropriately smoothed spectrum with the lower resolution lris data .",
    "the combined lris spectra , smoothed to the lowest resolution data taken with the @xmath27/mm grating ( resolution 17.4  ) , is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , and the hires spectrum in figure  [ fig:2 ] . prior to any extinction corrections ,",
    "both continua are well fit by a flat @xmath34  spectrum in the line - free portions of the red spectrum , and this is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the fluxed lris spectra are in excellent agreement with the photometric measurements of fan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and with their estimated @xmath35 continuum magnitude of 20.01 ( 35 @xmath36jy ) .",
    "a strong doublet is visible superposed on the emission ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we measure a doublet ratio @xmath37 and a redshift @xmath8 for this system . if the strong rest equivalent width ( @xmath38  ) indicates a large galaxy along the line - of - sight ( bergeron & boiss 1991 ; steidel , dickinson , & persson 1994 ) , the quasar may be amplified by lensing .",
    "the simplest measures of the opacity of the neutral hydrogen are the oke and korycanski ( 1982 ) indices . following schneider , schmidt , & gunn ( 1991a ) and schneider et  al .",
    "( 1991b ) we measure the index @xmath39 in the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath14   to @xmath15  , obtaining @xmath40  in both the lower resolution spectra .",
    "this can be compared with the values of 0.55 to 0.74 measured by schneider et  al .",
    "( 1991b ) and kennefick , djorgovski , & de carvalho ( 1995 ) in quasars in the range @xmath41  and with the values of 0.74 obtained by schneider et al .  for the @xmath42  quasar pc1158 + 4635 and 0.64 for the @xmath43  quasar pc1247 + 3406 .",
    "it is considerably smaller than the value of 0.9 predicted by zhang et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) for models with the haardt and madau ( 1996 ) @xmath44  evolution , with @xmath45  and @xmath46 , suggesting that these models are underestimating @xmath47  at high redshift .    this can also be examined by looking at the regions of minimum opacity in the much higher resolution hires spectrum . as can be seen from figure  [ fig:2 ] , portions of the hires spectrum return close to the extrapolated continuum .",
    "14% of the spectrum has @xmath18  in the observed wavelength range @xmath48   if we extrapolate the continuum with a @xmath49  power law .",
    "this fraction is not highly sensitive to the power law choice , and reduces only to 11% if we use a @xmath50  extrapolation .",
    "the regions of minimum opacity around 6790   and 6948    have extremely low optical depth . the mean optical depth between",
    "6946   and 6949   is @xmath51  for a @xmath49  extrapolation and @xmath52  for a @xmath50  extrapolation , where the errors are based only on the statistical noise in the region . in the subsequent discussion",
    "we will adopt what we believe is a conservative limit of @xmath18  at this redshift of 4.72 .    for a uniformly distributed igm and @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55  is the hubble constant in units of @xmath56 , @xmath57  is the metagalactic flux at the lyman edge ( @xmath58  with @xmath59 ) and @xmath60  is the temperature of the gas in units of @xmath61  k ( giallongo et  al . 1994 ) .",
    "for @xmath18  we obtain @xmath62 using haardt & madau s value of @xmath63  at @xmath64  would give @xmath65 .    if , however , the minimum opacity arises in cosmic minivoids , this number must be corrected upward to allow for the underdensity in these regions .",
    "simulations with current cosmological parameters suggest that the profile of the density distribution at @xmath10  will be centered on a mode of an underdensity of about 0.5 , and will have very little volume indeed at underdensities of 0.2 or less ( e.g. , zhang et  al .",
    "the underdense regions are relatively cold , with temperatures of around 5000  k. if we conservatively assume that the minimum opacity portions of the current spectrum arise in regions which are underdense by a factor of five , and set @xmath66 , we would obtain @xmath67  of 0.019 for @xmath68 .",
    "we can compare this estimate of the baryon density to that derived from measurements of primordial @xmath69 .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath70  ( 0.02 ) that might currently be possible would correspond to @xmath71 ( songaila , wampler , & cowie 1997 ; webb et al .",
    "1997 ) whereas @xmath72 , or @xmath73 , is obtained by tytler s group ( burles & tytler 1998 ) . even with the minimum @xmath74 , we require @xmath75  at @xmath64 , whereas the low @xmath69  value would require @xmath76 , more than an order of magnitude higher than the haardt - madau estimate .",
