    "the behavior of @xmath5-elements such as oxygen , magnesium , silicon , sulfur , calcium , and titanium in metal - poor halo and disk stars provides us with very useful information and constraints for exploring stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galaxy in the early phase , since these elements are believed to be produced mainly by type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) of massive stars ( e.g. timmes , woosely , & weaver 1995 ; chiappini et al .",
    "1999 ; carretta , gratton , & sneden 2000 ) and are fossilized in stars which have been born at various epochs of the galaxy evolution .",
    "numerous abundance works have been carried out for these elements ( e.g. see a review of mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath5-elements , except for o and s , show a general trend of abundances such that [ @xmath5-element / fe ] increases with decreasing metallicity [ fe / h ] down to about @xmath6 dex , and forms a plateau with [ @xmath5-element / fe ] @xmath7  0.5 dex in the range of [ fe / h ] @xmath8 dex .",
    "here we define [ a / b]@xmath9 log ( a / b)@xmath10log ( a / b)@xmath11 for the elements of a and b and use it throughout the text hereafter .",
    "the behavior of [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ] is controversial , i.e. whether [ o / fe ] shows a plateau ( e.g. barbuy 1988 ; fulbright & kraft 1999 ) or a steady linear increase with decreasing [ fe / h ] ( e.g. boesgaard et al .",
    "1999 ; israelian et al . 2001 ; takeda et al . 2002 ) .    as for the behavior of s among metal - poor stars ,",
    "it is not well understood because there are only four previous works dealing with a larger number of stars : clegg , lambert , & tomkin ( 1981 ) and franois ( 1987 , 1988 ) for a total number of 44 dwarfs and one giant star ; prochaska et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for nine thick disk dwarfs .",
    "these works analyzed s abundances in the metallicity range , @xmath12 @xmath1[fe / h ] @xmath1@xmath2 , but mostly in [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",
    "the scarcity of the s abundance works is mainly due to the difficulty in observing the s lines available to abundance analysis .",
    "there are no strong lines in the visual region suitable enough for analysis , but there are a few relatively strong lines of s  i  ( multiplet number 6 ) in the near - infrared region of 8670  8700  . among the s  i  ( 6 ) lines , the strongest line at 8694.641    and a weak line at 8693.958    are free from blending with lines of other ions such as si i and fe  i  , while the remaining lines are blended with such ions .",
    "even the strongest line at 8694.6    generally becomes very weak for stars with effective temperature ( @xmath14  ) of @xmath15 5500 k and with metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "franois 1987 , 1988 ) .    among these previous studies ,",
    "franois  ( 1988 ) suggested that [ s / fe ] becomes overabundant and constant in the halo stars with a value of @xmath17 dex in the metallicity range of @xmath18[fe / h ] @xmath1@xmath6 , while prochaska et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found no indication of a significant overabundance of [ s / fe ] with a mean value of @xmath19 dex and no trend with metallicity in the range of @xmath20 @xmath1[fe / h ] @xmath1@xmath21 .",
    "prochaska et al . ( 2000 ) also postulated that a more careful , extensive stellar abundance analysis of s in metal - poor stars is warranted since s is one of important elements in quasar absorption - line studies .",
    "very recently , israelian & rebolo ( 2001 ) analyzed the s abundances in six metal - poor stars with metallicities in the range of @xmath22 [ fe / h ] @xmath23 using observational data of s  i  lines at 8694  .",
    "their results indicate a monotonic increase of [ s / fe ] as [ fe / h ] decreases , reaching [ s / fe]@xmath24  @xmath25 below [ fe / h ] @xmath26 .",
    "takeda et al . (",
    "2002 ; hereafter paper i ) also very recently reported the abundance analysis of s for very metal - poor giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath1@xmath27 observed with the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt 1994 ) of the 10 m keck i telescope as a byproduct in the oxygen abundance study . it is suggested that [ s / fe ] increases linearly with decreasing [ fe / h ] , which is just the same trend as found in israelian & rebolo ( 2001 ) , and this behavior resembles that of o. however , paper i s results of s are yet preliminary and should be superseded with those of this study .    in this paper , in order to explore the behavior of s in the metallicity range of @xmath0 @xmath1[fe / h ] @xmath1@xmath2 , we carried out extensive lte abundance analyses of s for the six samples of very metal - poor stars in paper i observed with the keck i hires ( hereafter , the hires sample ) and of metal - poor dwarfs observed at the okayama astrophysical observatory ( hereafter , the oao sample ) .",

    "( 1981 ) and franois ( 1987 , 1988 ) based on our system of analysis to eliminate the systematic differences between our and the previous analyses .",
    "we further perform the non - lte ( nlte ) abundance analysis for all these sample stars to examine how the nlte abundances of s behave and how the nlte affects the lte abundance determination , since a nlte analysis of s abundance in metal - poor stars has not been done until now .",
    "the basic data of the sample stars of hires , oao , franois ( 1987 , 1988 ) , and clegg et al . ( 1981 ) are presented in table 1 .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "the ccd spectroscopic observations of the hires sample were carried out in 1997 and 1999 using hires on the keck i telescope for the wavelength range , 6330 @xmath1@xmath30 @xmath18760  , with resolution @xmath31 and 60000 , respectively .",
    "the journal of observations is presented in table 1 of paper i , and the data reduction was performed with the makee package developed by one of us ( t.a .",
    "barlow ) for hires data .",
    "the reader is asked to refer to paper i for the details of observations and data reduction .",
    "the s / n ratios in the wavelength region around the s  i  lines at 8694    are estimated to be 190  410 in the sample stars .",
    "the low values are mainly due to the difficulty of complete removal of fringes in the spectra .",
    "the observed spectra in the vicinity of the s  i  lines are shown in figures 1a  1f .    the oao sample of 25 dwarfs and the moon were observed in 1997 and 1998 using the coude spectrograph of the 188 cm telescope at the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "the wavelength range observed is @xmath32 8400  8830  , and the resolution @xmath33 at 8700  .",
    "the ccd data were reduced with the iraf package , following the standard procedure of extracting one - dimensional spectra .",
    "the s / n ratios around 8700    are in the range of 120  400 , but mostly between 200  350 .",
    "equivalent widths ( @xmath34  ) of the two blend - free s  i  lines at 8693.958    and 8694.641   in spectra of the hires sample were measured by gaussian fitting ( or by direct integration if necessary ) using the _ splot _ task of iraf , and are listed in the hires sample entry of table 5 .",
    "it turned out that our @xmath34  values of the s  i  8694.641   excellently agree with those measured in paper i for the sample stars , except for the giant star hd 88609 .",
    "while the @xmath34  value for hd 88609 was estimated to be 1.9 m   as an uncertain value in paper i , it should be replaced with our measurement ( @xmath35 m ) as an upper limit corresponding to the noise level with a s / n ratio of @xmath36 230 , because the s  i   8694.641    line is not detected at this noise level , as seen in figure 1c .",
    "since the spectral resolution @xmath37 of data of the oao sample is not high enough to separate two s  i  lines clearly , two blended s  i  lines were regarded as one line and its @xmath34  was measured by a direct integration using the _ splot _ task of iraf .",
    "the results are given in the seventh column of table 4 .",
    "we also measured @xmath34  of six fe  i  lines in the oao sample by gaussian fitting using the _ splot _ task of iraf , and listed them in table 3 .",

    "our oao sample overlaps with nine stars among the samples of franois  ( 1987 , 1988 ) and clegg et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , so that the sample of this study consists of six giants and 61 dwarfs ( 62 dwarfs , including the sun ) in total .",
    "abundance analyses were carried out using kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 line - blanketed model atmospheres , based on which the atmospheric models of individual stars were constructed by interpolation in terms of atmospheric parameters of effective temperature @xmath14  , surface gravity log @xmath38  , and metallicity [ fe / h ] . in this section",
    "we describe the determinations of atmospheric parameters and the analyses of fe and s abundances with lte and nlte calculations .",
    "while interstellar reddening @xmath39 affects estimates of effective temperatures based on color indices , it has been usually assumed that no reddening corrections need be applied to the stars within 100 pc .",
    "however , this assumption could break down for some stars , with significant reddening ( @xmath40.01 mag ) , even if they are within 100 pc , because the maps of reddening in the galaxy show a very patchy distribution of reddening at all galactic latitudes ( burstein & heiles 1978 , 1982 ) . because @xmath39=0.10 mag has been found to alter the derived @xmath14   by 400  550 k for such cool stars as in our sample ( laird , carney , & latham 1988 )",
    ", @xmath39=0.01 may change @xmath14  by 40 ",
    "55 k. our test calculations confirmed these changes in @xmath14  .",
    "consequently , we decided to estimate @xmath39 for _ all _ our sample stars regardless of their distances .",
    "almost all reddening corrections had been made based on the maps of burstein & heiles ( 1978 , 1982 ) until 1998 when a new , modern source of reddening was published by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "they constructed the full - sky maps of the galactic dust using the far - infrared data observed by the _ infrared astronomy satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) and the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on board the _ cobe _ satellite .",
    "they demonstrated that the new dust maps predict reddening with an accuracy of 16 % , which is twice as accurate as that estimated from the burstein & heiles maps in regions of low and moderate reddening .",
    "hence we used the new dust maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to estimate @xmath39 of our sample stars . after we estimated a total reddening @xmath40 in the direction of a given star , the @xmath39 to the star at distance _",
    "d _ pc was calculated with the same relation as employed by beers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath41 exp[@xmath42 sin _ b_@xmath43/_h _ ] } , where _ b _ is the galactic latitude and _ h _ is a scale height of 125 pc assumed for the dust layer .",

    "resulting @xmath39 larger than 0.01 mag are given in the fifth column of table 1 and used for determinations of @xmath14  and log @xmath38  .",
    "as clearly seen from these results , reddening should be examined for stars even at close distances .",
    "note a typical example of hd 190248 at a distance of @xmath44 pc ( @xmath45 mas ) with a reddening of @xmath46 mag in the franois   ( 1987 ) sample .",
    "effective temperatures of the hires sample , one giant star hd 111721 , and one dwarf star hd 182572 were derived using the empirical calibration of alonso , arribas , & martnez - roger ( 1999a ) for @xmath47 index and [ fe / h ] , which is based on the infrared flux method ( irfm ) .",

    "a slope is essentially determined by [ s / fe ] in halo stars , so that further observations of a larger sample of halo stars are indispensable to establish an increase trend of [ s / fe ] with a trustworthy value of slope .",

    "they found that a larger amount of s is synthesized by oxygen burning in hypernovae , which leads to higher [ s / fe ] ratios to be observed in metal - poor halo stars if hypernovae occurred in the early phase of the galaxy evolution .",

    "they also found that even one hypernova can produce 210 times more fe than normal core - collapse sne , which makes [ @xmath5-elements / fe ] ratios smaller .",
    "consequently , if such metal - poor halo stars , as included in our sample , formed from some hypernova ejecta , the iron mass of these stars should be smaller by factors of @xmath410 than those presented , for instance , in table 2 to explain the [ s / fe ] trend observed in this study and israelian & rebolo ( 2001 ) . as discussed for the case of abundances in the black hole binary gro j1655@xmath5640 by nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , there may be some possible ways to produce the ejecta with smaller fe mass using hypernova models with a certain mass cut at large @xmath158 ( mass included in the radius @xmath159 of the precollapse star ) or with asymmetric explosions such as have a jet .",
    "in addition to these possibilities , the mixing and dilution of ejecta to the interstellar medium plays an important role in determining the metallicity of halo stars .",
    "nakamura et al . ( 1999 ) suggested that the [ fe / h ] of halo stars are mainly determined by the mass of interstellar hydrogen mixed with the ejecta of the relevant sn ii , and that the mass of such interstellar hydrogen varies by an order of magnitude and is larger for both cases of the larger explosion energy of sn and the larger strmgren radius of the progenitor .",
    "a more detailed discussion on the justification of the increasing trend of [ s / fe ] has been made with relation to hypernovae / supernovae by israelian & rebolo ( 2001 ) .",

    "<S> , we find that the slope of the increasing trend is @xmath3 in the nlte behavior of [ s / fe ] , which is comparable to that observed in [ o / fe ] . the observed behavior of s may require chemical evolution models of the galaxy , in which scenarios of hypernovae nucleosynthesis and/or time - delayed deposition into interstellar medium are incorporated .    </S>",
