    "the experimental discovery of narrow low - lying charm - strange mesons @xmath7 is an important event in heavy meson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "many theoretical interpretations were proposed @xcite .",
    "however , the large electromagnetic branching ratio of @xmath8 observed by belle collaboration favors the assignment of these two states as conventional @xmath1 states @xcite .",
    "these two states belong to the @xmath9 doublet with @xmath10 in the heavy quark effective field theory .",
    "recently selex collaboration observed an exotic charm - strange meson @xmath11 .",
    "its decay width is very narrow , @xmath12 mev at @xmath13 c.l .",
    "the decay channels are @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the unusual relative branching ratio : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this observation has inspired a lot of theoretical papers @xcite .    in order to explain why this relative branching ratio is abnormal ,",
    "let s first assume ( 1 ) su(3 ) flavor symmetry and ( 2 ) that the quark content of @xmath0 is @xmath17 .",
    "the charge conjugate state @xmath18 belongs to @xmath19 triplet when the heavy quark transforms as a @xmath19 singlet .",
    "we denote the triplet as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are su(3 ) flavor partners of @xmath22 .",
    "then the decay of heavy meson triplet @xmath23 can be described with the effective lagrangian in the @xmath19 favor symmetry limit @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matrix of pseudoscalar meson octet @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the final state heavy pseudoscalar meson triplet .",
    "we suppressed the lorentz indices for mesons .",
    "the two - body decay width of a meson reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dimensionless effective coupling constant , @xmath30 is the angular momentum for decay .",
    "@xmath31 is the parent mass and @xmath32 is the decay momentum in the center of mass frame @xmath33[m_0 ^ 2-(m_1-m_2)^2]\\}^{\\frac12},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the masses of final mesons .",
    "the ratio of decay widths of these two channels for @xmath36 is @xmath37    using @xmath38 , @xmath39 mev , @xmath40 mev , we get @xmath41 which is nearly 15 times larger than the experimental value @xcite !    clearly either some important physics is missing or one of the above two assumptions of su(3 ) symmetry and @xmath11 as a @xmath1 state is wrong . in the following sections we analyze four different interpretations of this charming state and the resulting phenomenology .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that @xmath42 is a tetraquark @xcite",
    ". then , there should be other tetraquark partners of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , its narrow width may require that quarks inside @xmath11 form tightly bound clusters like diquarks @xcite .",
    "we give a brief review of different versions of tetraquark interpretations .",
    "tetraquarks with quark content @xmath43 form four multiplets : two triplets , one anti - sextet and one 15-plet @xmath44 the wave functions of these states can be found in ref .",
    "the identification of @xmath11 as the @xmath45 isoscalar member of the @xmath46 tetraquarks with the quark content @xmath47 leads to the relative branching ratio @xcite @xmath48 this decay pattern arises from the su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients very naturally .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath36 is dominated by @xmath49 with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 fluctuates into @xmath51 .",
    "hence , its decay mode is mainly @xmath52 .",
    "the final states @xmath53 are produced through the annihilation of @xmath50 into @xmath54 which requires @xmath4 component .",
    "thus this process is ozi suppressed . in this way",
    "the anomalous decay pattern is achieved .    in the diquark correlation configuration @xcite , @xmath36 is suggested to be a @xmath55 state where the subscript numbers are color representations . with the assumption that @xmath56 has small mixing with @xmath57 , one can give a nice interpretation for the narrow width .",
    "the mixing between @xmath50 and @xmath54 can lead to the unusual branching ratio .",
    "all the above three tetraquark interpretations predict the same production rates for @xmath58 final states .",
    "a serious challenge is that selex collaboration did nt find any signal in the @xmath59 channel @xcite .",
    "a very different tetraquark version @xmath60 is proposed in refs .",
    "naively , one would expect @xmath15 decay channel is suppressed while @xmath61 and @xmath62 modes are both important .",
    "interestingly , ref .",
    "@xcite invoked the isospin symmetry breaking to explain the relative branching ratio .",
    "it was proposed that the mass eigenstate @xmath36 is the mixture between the two flavor eigenstates @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath63 is the @xmath65 , @xmath66 state in @xmath19 6 representation and @xmath67 is the @xmath68 state in @xmath69 with our notation . with some special mixing scheme , the relative ratio is found to be @xmath70 . at the same time , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite predicted @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "some authors suggested that @xmath11 be the first radial excitation of @xmath2 with @xmath73 .",
    "the nodal structure of the radial wave function of @xmath42 ensures the narrow width while different decay momentum in two channels lead to anomalous decay pattern @xcite .",
    "we want to emphasize that two new narrow states @xmath74 and @xmath75 should also exist as flavor partners of @xmath11 within this scheme .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath11 and @xmath74 should roughly be the strange quark mass @xmath76 mev .",
    "so their masses are around 2532 mev .",
    "if @xmath11 is interpreted as the first radial excitation of @xmath2 , @xmath77 should be the first radial excitation of @xmath78 .",
    "similarly one expects the following b - meson analogues : @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the branching ratio of the s - wave two pion decay modes may be significant if @xmath11 is the radial excitation .",
    "we want to point out that the decay momentum of the two channels @xmath52 and @xmath15 are the same in the exact @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "then there is no anomalous decay pattern . in other words , the origin of this kind of explanation of the anomalous decay pattern can be traced back to the su(3 ) falvor symmetry breaking effects . in the following",
    "we shall use the effective lagrangian formalism to analyze this effect in a model - independent way .",
    "the symmetry breaking is caused by the quark mass matrix @xmath79 .",
    "we assume the isospin symmetry .",
    "the symmetry breaking lagrangian reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82    for @xmath18 , we have @xmath83 @xmath84.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] naively one would expect @xmath85 .",
    "if we assume the physical @xmath86 meson is approximately @xmath87 , we can extract the value @xmath88 from the relative branching ratio @xmath89 .",
    "numerically there are two possibilities : @xmath90 or @xmath91 although the above numbers seem quite unnatural , the anomalously large @xmath19 breaking can explain the special decay pattern of @xmath11 in principle .    for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94    in general , @xmath95 may not have the same decay pattern as @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in the extreme case @xmath96 for the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ posi ] ) and @xmath97 for the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ nega ] ) .",
    "as in the last section we assume @xmath11 is a @xmath1 state with @xmath73 . instead of invoking very large su(3 ) breaking effects to account for its decay pattern , we introduce the interaction between su(3 ) singlet @xmath4 and @xmath11 and consider the mixing between @xmath87 and @xmath4 .",
    "now the effective lagrangian becomes @xmath98    the physical states @xmath86 and @xmath99 are admixtures of @xmath87 and @xmath4 , @xmath100 with the mixing angle @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "now we have @xmath102 the lagrangian involving @xmath92 and @xmath93 reads @xmath103    from the relative decay ratio we can extract either @xmath104 or @xmath105 with these values , we have following relative branching ratios @xmath106 for the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ posit ] ) and @xmath107 for the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ negat ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath4 mixes strongly with @xmath108 because of axial anomaly .",
    "the anomalously large coupling between @xmath4 and @xmath0 indicates that @xmath0 may be a heavy hybrid meson containing explicit glue @xcite . that s the subject of the next section .",
    "large @xmath109 formalism is a very useful and unique tool which is applicable in the whole energy regime from zero to infinity . in this section ,",
    "we explore the possibility of @xmath42 being a hybrid state containing explicit glue using large @xmath109 expansion .",
    "recall that the normalized interpolating currents for a pure glueball and conventional meson a in the large @xmath109 limit read @xmath110 @xmath111 the factor @xmath112 is introduced to ensure the creation amplitude by @xmath113 from the vacuum is @xmath114 in the large @xmath109 limit .",
    "i.e. , the following matrix elements are order unity when @xmath115 : @xmath116 @xmath117 we have depicted @xmath118 mesons , @xmath119 hybrid states and glueballs in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in order to illustrate the formalism ,",
    "we consider the @xmath109 order of the mixing amplitude between a glueball and @xmath118 meson , which can be extracted through the correlation function : @xmath120 the feynman diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . also shown is the double - line representation in the large @xmath109 approach .",
    "there are two independent closed color loops which contribute @xmath121 while two vertices contribute @xmath122 .",
    "its @xmath109 order reads @xmath123 in other words , glueballs decouple from the conventional mesons when @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we consider two kinds of heavy hybrid mesons : ( 1 ) @xmath124 with @xmath73 and @xmath1 in the color octet state or ( 2 ) @xmath125 with @xmath45 and @xmath1 in the color singlet state .",
    "@xmath126 @xmath127    for the @xmath73 hybrid meson , its decay channels are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] using the feynman diagram and double - line representation .",
    "the dominant decay mode in the large @xmath109 limit is for the gluon to split into a color - octet @xmath118 pair in diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "then the @xmath118 recombine with @xmath1 pair to form @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath109 order of this decay amplitude is @xmath129 .",
    "when it decays into a glueball and @xmath118 meson , the decay amplitude is @xmath130 , i.e. , diagram ( c ) .",
    "when it decays into two @xmath131 mesons through color - singlet two gluon intermediate states in diagram ( b ) , the decay amplitude is @xmath132 .",
    "in other words , the assignment of @xmath11 as a @xmath73 hybrid meson will not lead to the abnormal decay pattern observed by selex collaboration .",
    "now we turn to the second case . with this configuration ,",
    "it is possible to understand the narrowness of @xmath42 .",
    "when it decays into a glueball and @xmath133 in diagram ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the amplitude is @xmath134 in the large @xmath109 limit .",
    "hence , this would be the most possible decay channel if kinematics allows .",
    "however , it can not occur because the glueball is too heavy .",
    "the decay mode @xmath135 in diagram ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is @xmath136 and subleading .",
    "however , it is also forbidden by kinematics .",
    "therefore @xmath42 is narrow .",
    "we note that @xmath86 meson is a mixture of @xmath87 and @xmath4 .",
    "the mixing amplitude is @xmath134 arising from su(3 ) symmetry breaking effect .",
    "hence the kinematically allowed decay mode @xmath62 becomes the dominant mode although it is @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath138 channel can happen only when the color - singlet two gluons annihilate into a pair of light quarks , namely after the hybrid becomes a four - quark state .",
    "this hybrid to four - quark transition is @xmath139 suppressed in amplitude .",
    "the four - quark state can decay to both @xmath140 and @xmath138 , and the later channel is further suppressed compared to the former due to the color mismatch factor which is @xmath141 in amplitude .",
    "the @xmath109 order can be read from diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] @xmath142 naively there are three closed color loops , hence one would get the factor @xmath143 .",
    "however , the charm and strange quark are in the color singlet state . hence their color indices are the same . in other words",
    ", there are only two independent color loops .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath144 where the numerical value arises from using @xmath145 .",
    "the assignment of @xmath11 as a @xmath146 state explains the decay pattern quite naturally",
    ". a dynamical calculation of the mass of such a heavy hybrid meson will be very desirable , which is beyond the present note .",
    "in this note , we considered various possible interpretations of @xmath36 and discussed the resulting phenomenology .",
    "future experimental confirmation of this state and discovery of its partners will help unveil the mysterious underlying dynamics of this narrow charm - strange meson .",
