    "the study of the production of electroweak bosons in association with jets of hadrons in the final state constitutes a fundamental item in the high-@xmath5 physics program at the tevatron .",
    "these events are main backgrounds to many interesting physics processes like , for example , top production , the search for the sm higgs , and supersymmetry . the cdf experiment has recently published precise measurements on jets in events with a z/@xmath6 boson in the final state  @xcite , where inclusive jet cross sections as a function of jet transverse momentum and jet multiplicity are measured and compared to pqcd predictions  @xcite . at the leading order ( lo ) in pqcd ,",
    "@xmath7+jet events are driven by the processes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while higher orders contributions , including additional parton radiation , produce mutiple jets in the final state .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd predictions for @xmath0+jets production are only available for jet multiplicities @xmath10 up to @xmath11 .",
    "this contribution presents updated results with an increased data sample corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of @xmath3 .",
    "the events are required to have two electrons with @xmath12  gev and a reconstructed invariant mass in the range @xmath13  gev/@xmath14 around the @xmath15 boson mass .",
    "the electron candidates are reconstructed using criteria described in  @xcite . in this study",
    ", one electron is required to be central ( @xmath16 ) and fulfill tight selection cuts , while the second electron is required to pass a looser selection and to be either central or forward with @xmath17 .",
    "the events are selected to have a reconstructed primary vertex with @xmath18-position within 60  cm around the nominal interaction point , and at least one jet with transverse momentum @xmath19",
    "gev/@xmath20 , rapidity in the range @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the distance between the jet and each of the two electrons in the final state .",
    "the main backgrounds to the @xmath24+jets sample arise from inclusive - jets and @xmath25+jets events , and are estimated from the data .",
    "other background contributions from @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31+jets final states are estimated using monte carlo samples .",
    "the total background in inclusive @xmath24+jets production is about 12@xmath32 for @xmath33 , and increases up to about 17@xmath32 for @xmath34 .",
    "the measured cross sections are corrected for acceptance and smearing effects back to the hadron level using pythia - tune  a monte carlo event samples  @xcite , cteq5l  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the proton and antiproton , and a bin - by - bin unfolding procedure that also accounts for the efficiency of the @xmath24 selection criteria .",
    "the final results refer to hadron level jets with @xmath19  gev/@xmath20 and @xmath35 , in a limited and well - defined kinematic range for the @xmath0 decay products : @xmath36  gev , @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 , @xmath13  gev/@xmath14 , and @xmath22 . in order to avoid any bias on the correction factors due to the particular pdf set used , which translates into slightly different simulated @xmath40 distributions ,",
    "the pythia - tune  a monte carlo event sample is re - weighted until it accurately follows the measured @xmath40 spectra .",
    "the unfolding factors @xmath41 are computed separately for the different measurements and vary between 2.0 at low  @xmath42 and 2.3 at high  @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pt](top ) shows the measured inclusive jet differential cross sections as a function of @xmath42 in @xmath24+jets production , with @xmath33 and @xmath43 , compared to nlo pqcd predictions .",
    "the cross sections decrease by more than three orders of magnitude as @xmath42 increases from 30  gev / c up to about 300  gev / c .",
    "the nlo pqcd predictions are computed using the mcfm program  @xcite with cteq6.1 m pdfs  @xcite , with the renormalization and factorization scales set to @xmath44 , and using a midpoint  @xcite algorithm with @xmath45 and @xmath46  @xcite to reconstruct jets at the parton level .",
    "the theoretical predictions include parton - to - hadron correction factors @xmath47 that approximately account for non - perturbative contributions from the underlying event and fragmentation into hadrons . in each measurement @xmath48",
    "is estimated using the pythia - tune  a monte carlo samples , as the ratio between the nominal @xmath42 distribution and the one obtained by turning off both the interactions between proton and antiproton remnants and the string fragmentation in the monte carlo samples .",
    "the correction decreases as @xmath42 increases from about 1.2 ( 1.26 ) at @xmath42 of 30  gev / c to 1.02 ( 1.01 ) for @xmath49  gev/@xmath20 for @xmath33 ( @xmath43 ) , and is dominated by the underlying event contribution .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath48 is about @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) at low @xmath42 and goes down to @xmath52 at high @xmath42 for @xmath33 ( @xmath43 ) .",
