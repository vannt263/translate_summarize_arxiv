    "sk has recently presented a measurement of the energy spectrum of recoil electrons from solar neutrino scattering , corresponding to 504 days of data taking @xcite . by assuming the ssm estimate of the _ hep _ neutrino flux @xcite , @xmath10 and an undeformed @xmath1 neutrino spectrum , with an arbitrary normalization",
    ", they obtained a @xmath11 , corresponding to a 4.6 % confidence level @xcite .",
    "the poor fit is due mainly to the behaviour of the energy - bins above @xmath12 .",
    "escribano et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that a _ hep _ flux significantly larger than the ssm estimate could reproduce the observed spectrum .",
    "bahcall et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that a flux @xmath13 could actually mimic the sk spectrum .",
    "alternatively , one can keep the ssm prediction for _ hep _ neutrinos and look for other high energy neutrino sources . since the average energy of _ eb _",
    "neutrinos is roughly twice than that of _ hep _ neutrinos and since the @xmath0 scattering cross section increase linearly with energy , one expects that a flux @xmath14 could be sufficient to account for the high energy behaviour of sk data .    in order to provide a quantitative estimate ,",
    "let us analyse the data by using as free parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ssm prediction for the @xmath1 neutrino flux @xcite .",

    "as suggested by ssm , one has @xmath48 and consequently _ eb = r_b^ssm=210 ^ -1  cm^-2  s^-1  , i.e. five orders of magnitude lower than that required to account for sk data .",

    "relation ( [ screen ] ) is not so straightforward , especially because of the possible inadequacies of the debye screening theory @xcite and because of the relatively large thermal fluctuations which could results from the small number of ions in a debye sphere @xcite . for the similar case of @xmath52 electron capture , gruzinov & bahcall",
    "have performed a detailed analisys of the problem , concluding that relation ( [ omega ] ) is accurate at the 2% level .    by using the previous relations we can determine the ratio between electron capture and @xmath45 decay rates .",
    "we obtain : r=2.610 ^ -7(10.02 ) this value is about 30% larger than previous estimates @xcite which took into account only continuum electron states contribution . by using the ssm estimate of the @xmath1 neutrino flux , which is uncertain by about 17% @xcite ,",
