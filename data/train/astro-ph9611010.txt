    "pks 0123 + 257 ( v=17.5 , @xmath0 = 2.364 ) , or 4c 25.05 , is a radio loud quasar ( @xcite ; @xcite . )",
    "this object shows a strong , narrow absorption - line system with an absorption - line redshift ( @xmath3 ) close to the emission - line redshift ( @xmath0 . ) we selected this object for study with the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) on the keck i telescope in an effort to investigate the nature of intrinsic absorption systems .",
    "we define an `` intrinsic '' absorption system as one which is caused by clouds in the qso environment , either near the continuum source or elsewhere in the host galaxy .",
    "this is to be distinguished from systems which arise from intervening galaxies and intergalactic clouds .",
    "intrinsic systems can either be very broad ( @xmath410,000 km s@xmath5 ) as in the so called `` broad absorption - line '' ( bal ) qsos , or they can be relatively narrow ( @xmath4 100 km s@xmath5 ) with a number of cases being intermediate in width .",
    "intrinsic absorption systems can be used to study the qso environment , test standard models of quasars , and estimate metallicities in quasar environments .",
    "recent work has strongly suggested that gas near a qso has heavy element abundances much enhanced relative to the solar value ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein . )",
    "intrinsic narrow lines are potentially more useful in metallicity estimates than bals since it is often possible to separate the components of close doublets such as @xmath21548,1550 and  @xmath21238,1242 . in practice",
    "it can be ambiguous as to whether a particular narrow line absorption system with @xmath6 is intrinsic or intervening .",
    "for these reasons , it is important to develop means of distinguishing the two categories .",
    "the best candidates for intrinsic narrow lines are systems with @xmath7 .",
    "this category of `` associated '' absorption has been defined as lines which appear within several thousand km s@xmath5 of the emission redshift and are less than a few hundred km s@xmath5 wide ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite . ) since we expect some intervening lines to appear close to the emission redshift , these `` associated '' lines may not always be intrinsic to the qso .",
    "occasionally we observe strong , complex absorption , commonly with high excitation , which are thought to be intrinsic because such systems are rarely seen at @xmath8 ( _ e.g. _ pks 1157 + 014 , cf .",
    "@xcite and gc 1556 + 335 , cf . @xcite . )",
    "previous work on narrow associated absorption has attempted to establish the intrinsic nature of the lines statistically .",
    "there appears to be an excess of narrow lines near @xmath0 in large samples of qsos ( @xcite ; @xcite . )",
    "although this result has been questioned by other surveys ( @xcite ) , it is now apparent that systems with large total equivalent width tend to be close to the emission redshift ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be an excess of associated lines in radio - loud quasars ( @xcite ) relative to radio - quiet qsos ; such an excess could only be explained by an intrinsic origin .",
    "the following ways have been proposed to distinguish intrinsic from intervening absorption systems ( in order of decreasing reliability ) : ( 1 ) time variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 2 ) high electron density as derived from fine structure lines as a distance indicator when combined with an ionization level estimate ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 3 ) partial coverage of the background light source along our line - of - sight by the absorption - line region ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 4 ) spectropolarimetry revealing increased fractional polarization in the lines relative to the continuum ( so far only observed in bals , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , ( 5 ) velocity structure , _ i.e. _ breadth , complexity , and `` correlated '' or `` smooth '' profile shape across many components , ( 6 ) higher ionization level , and ( 7 ) higher metallicities ( _ e.g. _ @xcite . )",
    "although time variability has been observed often in balqsos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , method ( 1 ) generally requires extensive monitoring of a large sample of objects over at least a few years .",
    "method ( 2 ) requires the presence of fine structure lines ( usually ) of or .",
    "unfortunately , the high ionization and/or low column density of many systems makes these lines difficult to detect .",
    "method ( 4 ) requires long exposure times with low resolution and can only be used on objects with relatively high polarization and , therefore , has only been useful for studying a few wide bals .",
    "method ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are easy to apply but are very sensitive to photoionization models ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and there may be a large overlap in these qualities between intrinsic and intervening systems .",
    "fortunately , methods ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) can be applied directly and easily using keck and hires .",
    "recently it has become evident that high resolution spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios can be a useful tool in distinguishing intrinsic narrow line systems ( @xcite ; @xcite . ) in the case of some narrow lines with @xmath6 the lines appear to be smoother with less component structure than most intervening systems ; they also exhibit an effect which implies that the absorption - line region does not fully occult the background light source .",
    "this effect is inferred from the profiles of resolved lines in doublets such as  and .",
    "motivated by these considerations we investigate here the nature of the associated lines in the radio - loud quasar pks 0123 + 257 .",
    "the hires spectra for pks 0123 + 257 were obtained during service observing with the keck i telescope on september 11 and 12 , 1995 .",
    "we acquired 4 exposures of 40 minutes ( in cloudy skies and a full moon ) .",
    "three exposures were obtained with one echelle grating angle and one exposure with a different echelle angle in order to get complete wavelength coverage of the region 3700 to 6100  .",
    "the spectra were detected as 38 echelle orders on a 2048@xmath9 tectronics ccd .",
    "each exposure used a 0.86 arc - second slit ( 3 pixels ) for a resolution of approximately 6.3 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the actual resolution varies from about 6.0 to 6.5 km s@xmath5 fwhm due to the change in dispersion across each echelle order .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per 3 pixel resolution element ranged from 9 at 3900   to 26 at 5400  . the s / n also varies with the distance from the blaze on each order and the overlap between two setting angles .",
    "in particular , the setting with a single exposure had significantly lower s / n which creates low s / n regions in the red portion of the spectrum .",
    "the data were reduced using our own reduction package which automatically traces the orders , removes cosmic ray events , and uses an optimal weighting scheme similar to that of @xcite for extracting the spectra ( cf .",
    "barlow 1996 , in preparation . )",
    "the wavelength calibration used low - order polynomial fits to a thar arc lamp exposure in each order , loosely constrained by the fits in adjacent orders .",
    "the calibration error is about 0.1 pixel ( 0.2 km s@xmath5 ) root - mean - square with up to a maximum error of about 0.3 pixels ( 0.6 km s@xmath5 . )",
    "this is the relative error across the spectrum .",
    "the absolute wavelength error is about 0.3 pixels ( 0.6 km s@xmath5 ) , estimated from the night sky emission lines .",
    "altogether there can be up to @xmath41 km s@xmath5 error in the absolute wavelength value at any given pixel .",
    "the wavelengths are shifted to a vacuum , heliocentric scale .    due to imperfect corrections for variations in the pixel - to - pixel response ( flat field division )",
    ", we estimate a error in the relative level of the spectrum of about 0.5% which appears to cause `` undulations '' on the scale of several pixels .",
    "this is estimated from spectra of bright stars taken previously with hires .",
    "in addition , there are fluctuations due to our technique of forcing adjacent echelle orders to match over common wavelengths .",
    "it is estimated that systematic flux errors of @xmath410% may be present over @xmath41000 km s@xmath5 regions where the orders have overlapped in wavelength .",
    "figure 1 shows the hires data for pks 0123 + 257 from the ly@xmath1 ( @xmath101215 ) broad emission - line ( bel ) to the   @xmath101549 bel .",
    "the data were not flux calibrated and the spectrum has been continuum normalized . note the low s / n regions in the red portion of the spectrum . despite the artificial fluctuations left over from the order - splicing procedure , the relative strengths of the ly@xmath1 ,  @xmath101240 , and  @xmath101549 bels are evident .",
    "the @xmath11 absorption can be seen just redward of the most prominent emission peaks .",
    "an emission line redshift of @xmath12 is estimated by averaging the values measured from the ly@xmath1  and  emission peaks .",
    "in figure 2 , we compare the various lines in the associated system on a velocity scale in which zero velocity is defined at @xmath0 = 2.364 . there are three main absorption lines with the strongest absorption appearing at @xmath3=2.3693 or about 480 km s@xmath5 redward of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the strongest ly@xmath1  absorption line appears to have a flat - bottomed structure suggesting that the line is saturated , yet it does not reach zero intensity .",
    "this is a indication that the absorbing gas clouds do not completely cover the background light source along our line - of - sight .    the velocity shift of 600 km / s redward of the ly@xmath1 and emission peaks does not necessarily imply infall toward the qso .",
    "it has been shown that the  and ly@xmath1  bel peaks are systematically blue - shifted relative to the true redshift of the qso ( as determined by narrow forbidden lines ) by  500 @xmath13200 km s@xmath5 ( @xcite . )",
    "this implies that all the absorption shown in figure 2 may be produced by material ejected outward from the central qso engine . from other studies of line profile and velocity shift correlations ,",
    "we know that  can be shifted by as much as 1000 km s@xmath5 or more .",
    "however , the width of 3500 km s@xmath5 for the   bel in pks 0123 + 257 suggests that the shift is closer to a few hundred km s@xmath5 ( cf .",
    "this suggests that the strongest absorption line may be close to zero outflow velocity with respect to the qso",
    ".    if the absorbing gas temperature is @xmath410,000 k , then the thermal widths for ly@xmath1  and   are about 21 and 6 km s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "thus , the main  feature contains many thermal widths and is essentially resolved in our spectra .",
    "the main line is not smooth like conventional broad absorption - lines and shows some indication for narrow components .",
    "however , these components are not as distinct and well separated as the components which are often seen in intervening absorption complexes .",
    "overlapping components and apparently large line widths ( @xmath450 km s@xmath5 ) may be indicative of intrinsic rather than intervening absorption ( @xcite . )    the apparent partial coverage of the background light source can be investigated using two or more resolved lines from the same ion .",
    "the optical depth ratios should be equal to the ratios of the oscillator strengths of the lines ( assuming @xmath14 ) if the absorption clouds cover the light source .",
    "if we have resolved the  lines we can calculate the optical depth by taking the natural logarithm of the residual intensity ( @xmath15 ) with the continuum and emission - line flux normalized to unity , @xmath16 . we demonstrate that this is _ not _ the case in the pks 0123 + 257 system . we have scaled the optical depth of the @xmath101550 line by a factor of two after measuring the residual intensity assuming complete coverage by the absorbing clouds . in figure 3 ,",
    "we have plotted the scaled @xmath101550 line ( thick line ) over the unscaled @xmath101548 line .",
    "this figure shows that the 1548 line does not go deep enough to match the strength predicted by increasing the optical depth of the red line by two .",
    "therefore , both the main absorption system ( at 480 km s@xmath5 ) and the bluer system ( at 190 km s@xmath5 ) exhibit partial coverage .",
    "the error in the spectrum at the position of the @xmath101548 line at 330 km s@xmath5 is much larger than for the adjacent lines ( these wavelengths fell within the inter - order gap of the best exposures ) . given the depth of the red component , the data is consistent with a coverage fraction ( see below ) between 0.4 and 1.0 .",
    "figure 4 shows the same analysis for .",
    "although the data at these wavelengths have somewhat lower s / n , the lines appear to be consistent with complete coverage of the background light source . as a check of this analysis technique , we do the same comparison for the  lines in an absorption system at @xmath3=2.301 which is assumed to be due to an intervening absorber . as shown in figure 5 , this absorption system is consistent with complete coverage .",
    "we can also calculate the coverage fraction ( @xmath17 ) from the measured residual intensities at the lowest points in the lines .",
    "@xmath17 is defined as the fraction of the background light source , in this case the qso continuum source or the emission - line region , apparently covered by the absorbing clouds ( as defined by the formulas given below . )",
    "therefore , the amount of light ( on a normalized scale ) apparently leaking through the absorption - line region ( alr ) would be @xmath18 .",
    "if the coverage fraction at wavelength @xmath10 is @xmath19 , then the _ true _ optical depth of a line at @xmath10 with the observed residual intensity @xmath20 is given by : @xmath21 we neglect any smoothing of the line caused by the finite resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "apparent _ column density per unit velocity can be derived as described in savage and sembach ( 1991 ) : @xmath22 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath23 = 2 and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the residual intensity of the blue ( stronger ) line of the doublet and @xmath26 be the residual intensity of the red line .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 is the same for both lines . equating the column densities derived from each line , @xmath27",
    ", we have : @xmath28 @xmath29 if @xmath30 , we assume @xmath31 and if @xmath32 , we assume @xmath17=1 .",
    "the measured values of @xmath17 for are 0.94@xmath33 ( 1@xmath34 error limits ) at 480 km s@xmath5 and 0.63@xmath35 at 190 km s@xmath5 . in figure 3 , we have marked ( 3@xmath34 error limits ) the value of @xmath36 . in the case of the line at 480 km s@xmath5",
    ", the fact that the mark is close to the bottom of the line indicates that the lines have high optical depth ( _ i.e. _ are nearly saturated . )",
    "the width of the mark indicates the portion of the spectrum where the residual intensity was measured .",
    "the line at 190 km s@xmath5 also appears to be nearly saturated even though the lowest part of the line only reaches a residual intensity of about 0.3 .",
    "the measured values of @xmath17 for are 0.98@xmath37 ( 1@xmath34 error limits ) at 480 km s@xmath5 and 0.79@xmath38 at 190 km s@xmath5 . in figure 4",
    ", we show the values for the  lines . here",
    "the 1@xmath34 error limits in the @xmath36 value are shown .",
    "both systems appear to be consistent with complete coverage . although the s / n is much lower near the  lines , the measured value of @xmath36 is significantly lower ( @xmath42@xmath34 ) than @xmath36 for  for the strongest absorption line at 480 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 measured for the  line at 480 km s@xmath5 is 0.94 ( using the data between 472 and 492 km s@xmath5 . ) for the bluer line at 190 km s@xmath5 ( calculated between 182 and 196 km s@xmath5 ) , @xmath17 is about 0.63 .",
    "both of these values are significantly less than one ( @xmath39 . ) for  @xmath17 is measured to be 0.98 , and is consistent ( within 1@xmath34 ) with complete coverage .",
    "for ly@xmath1 we do not have another lyman line for comparison .",
    "however , the flatness of the bottom of the line at 480 km s@xmath5 suggests that it is saturated .",
    "using the bottom of the line as an estimate of the fractional coverage we get @xmath17=0.91 .",
    "( this is only a lower limit if the line is not saturated . )",
    "this value is slightly less than for . for  @xmath17",
    "is 0.93@xmath40 ( with 1@xmath34 errors ) .",
    "the noise near this line and the fact that the silicon lines may not be as well resolved as the carbon lines ( assuming that a significant portion of the width is due to thermal broadening , rather than just cloud turbulence ) makes this @xmath17 value rather uncertain .    in table 1",
    ", we show our measured values for the residual intensities at the lowest point in the lines and our estimates for the coverage fractions .",
    "we also calculate column densities assuming @xmath17=1 .",
    "since we know that the coverage may be incomplete for all these lines , these values are actually lower limits . in column 7 , we present conservative lower limit estimates using the values of @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that the   blue line yields a lower value than the red line indicates that the lines are saturated . in this case",
    ", we would need to fit the lines with voigt profiles to get accurate estimates of the column densities .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to determine the component positions and fwhm values for such a complex system with several overlapping components .",
    "however , we do know that log(n())@xmath4118.5 because a higher column density would show damping wings which are inconsistent with the data .",
    "we make the hypothesis here that the filling - in or partial coverage of the lines is due to light from the broad emission - line region ( belr ) leaking through ( or around ) the alr . from the depths of the lines",
    "it is clear that at least some of the belr is occulted by the absorbing clouds ( i.e. the residual intensity at the bottom of the absorption lines is much less than the strength of the bels . ) in this scenario it is reasonable to assume that all of the continuum source is covered since the continuum producing region is generally thought to be much smaller than the belr ( by a factor on the order of 100 , cf .",
    "however it is expected that this simple assumption will not be strictly valid , since multiple regions of varying dimensions may contribute to the bel and the continuum emitting regions ( cf .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested in that @xmath17 we calculate should be related to the strength of the bel at the position of the absorption line .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the fact that @xmath17 is nearly unity for  ( weak bel ) , larger for  ( strong bel ) , and larger still for ly@xmath1 which shows the highest emission line peak .",
    "let us assume a relatively simple model where the amount of light at the wavelength of the absorption line which is leaking through or around the alr is proportional to the strength of the bel at that wavelength .",
    "at the position of the  absorption , the bel level is 2.0 in continuum normalized units and @xmath17 is 0.94 ( where the bel plus continuum has been normalized to one . )",
    "this means that @xmath42 of the bel light is not occulted by the absorption clouds . for  the bel level",
    "this means that we would expect @xmath43 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "for ly@xmath1 the bel is 2.9 from which we expect a @xmath44 , consistent with our estimated value of 0.91 .",
    "however , this simple model does not apply to all the @xmath6 absorption lines .",
    "if we consider the line at 190 km s@xmath5 redward of the emission redshift ( see figure 3 ) , we find that the  line has @xmath17=0.63 .",
    "this means that @xmath45 of the bel light leaks through ( assuming it covers the continuum completely ) .",
    "the  line is too uncertain for comparison , but it is evident that the ly@xmath1 is much deeper than predicted .",
    "the predicted value is @xmath46 , but the actual @xmath17 for ly@xmath1 must be at least 0.85 ( see figure 2 . )    we note here a few factors which may cause deviations from the simplest interpretation .",
    "( 1 ) the position of the absorption lines over the bel will effect our calculations . for example , since the emission is greater at the position of @xmath101548 than @xmath101550 , this means that @xmath17 values may be slightly over - estimated . in the case of the opposite is true , since the emission is weaker at the position of the blue line of the doublet .",
    "this is presumably due to the ] 1402 bel and means that @xmath17 may be slightly larger than calculated . and",
    ", in the case of , we have a bel contribution from the red wing of ly@xmath1 .",
    "( 2 ) a complex geometry for the belr would imply that the size of the belr ( and hence the ability for the alr to cover it ) may vary with velocity and ion . in particular , there may be a narrow and broad component to the  bel such that the broad component is blue shifted and arises in an emitting region closer to the qso central engine than the narrow component ( @xcite . ) ( 3 ) the `` effective '' size of the alr may vary with ionization level and/or optical depth .",
    "for example , the geometry of the portion of the region with relatively high amounts of  may be different than the geometry of the portion of the alr with relatively high amounts of . in another study of narrow intrinsic lines in the qso um 675 ( @xcite )",
    ", it is noted that @xmath17 for  must be substantially less than that for ly@xmath1 .",
    "we can reconcile the earlier results by appealing to factor ( 3 ) .",
    "we hypothesize that the alr has a fixed boundary which is smaller than the apparent size of the belr as seen along our line - of - sight .",
    "this means that there is a maximum line depth which occurs when the optical depth is very high and the clouds occult all lines - of - sight through the alr .",
    "this is the case for the strongest absorption lines in pks 0123 + 257 , _",
    "e.g. _ , , and ly@xmath1 .",
    "however , if the column density of absorbing gas varies between different lines - of - sight through the alr , then at lower optical depth we get an _ effective _ @xmath17 which is significantly smaller .",
    "this is because the various lines - of - sight will contribute much differently to the line profile . in this scenario",
    ", we imagine that the observed absorption line is composed of a superposition of profiles from clouds with a range of column densities and a range of @xmath17 .",
    "for example , we suppose that there exists two sub - regions in the alr which cover different lines - of - sight .",
    "if we could look only through sub - region # 1 we would measure an optical depth of @xmath47 , and if we looked only through sub - region # 2 we would measure @xmath48 . in practice",
    ", we observe the sum of the light going through both sub - regions .",
    "if the first sub - region covers only 50% of the source then would measure @xmath49 , since the second sub - region contributes little to the observed line profile .",
    "let us now increase the optical depth of both regions by a factor of 5 . since the optical depth in sub - region # 1 was already fairly high ,",
    "these clouds contribute only a little more to the depth of the line , but the clouds of the sub - region # 2 now contribute much more . the line becomes deeper and @xmath17 increases .",
    "this means that the _ effective _ @xmath17 can vary depending on the optical depth of a given transition without changing the geometry of the clouds or the region . in this scenario ,",
    "factor ( 3 ) can cause a variation in the effective @xmath17 for different ions _ and _ for different lines of the same ion .",
    "note that this complicates what we mean by partial coverage . in this model",
    ", we can not define partial coverage as simply the fraction of sight lines which pass through absorbing gas .    applying these ideas to our results ,",
    "the system at 190 km s@xmath5 ( see figure 2 ) has clouds which can cover at least 85% of the background light source as shown by the ly@xmath1 line .",
    "however , the lines - of - sight through this region have varying column density such that the less abundant c@xmath50 ions only contribute significantly to the line strength in certain sub - regions .",
    "these sub - regions are only able to effectively cover about 63% of the background light source .",
    "note that in this model we do _ not _ need to vary the ionization level among the clouds in the alr , we only need to vary the column density looking through different lines - of - sight toward the light source .",
    "we can also use this model to explain the  in the main system at 480 km s@xmath5 .",
    "above we measured @xmath17 of  to be 0.93 with a large error . this value appears to be larger than the value for  even though the  bel is stronger than the  bel .",
    "this is inconsistent with the simple analysis we discussed at the beginning of this subsection for this absorption system .",
    "the explanation here is that the line is weak and thus we must appeal to factor ( 3 ) , _ i.e. _ the si@xmath50 ions in the lower column density lines - of - sight to not contribute substantially to the line depth , and therefore for  we do not get a @xmath17 which is proportional to the bel strength .",
    "once we have absorbing clouds which do not cover the background light source a range of effects must be considered when interpreting the depth and profile of a line for the purpose of deriving column densities .",
    "when all the effects discussed above are considered , we can appreciate the difficulty in determining accurate column densities .",
    "if we were to calculate the column densities assuming complete coverage in this object , we would get values for ,  and ly@xmath1  from which we could estimate ionization levels and abundances . in reality",
    "these values are inaccurate since the lines are actually nearly saturated and the varying depths are not caused simply by differences in ionic abundance , but rather they are determined largely by differences in the fractional coverage of the belr .",
    "recently there has been work done on the metallicity and ionization levels in intrinsic absorption systems . in 0226 - 1024 , korista et al .",
    "( 1996 ) use ground - based and hst spectra of numerous transitions to deduce enhanced metal abundances for the absorbing gas relative to solar . in um 675 ,",
    "hamann et al .  (",
    "1995 ) argue for stratified regions of greatly differing ionization levels . in pg 0946 + 301 ,",
    "junkkarinen et al .  (",
    "1995 ) argue for phosphorus abundances two orders of magnitude greater than solar . and using high resolution spectroscopy of two qsos , petitjean et al .",
    "( 1994 ) argue for increased metallicities for absorption systems near the emission - line redshift .",
    "the success of line fitting and ionization estimates for these systems indicates that these results are , in general , accurate .",
    "however , all of these results should be considered in the context of the problems with studying intrinsic absorption lines as discussed above .",
    "the possibility of partial coverage has been discussed in some of these works , but not yet applied .",
    "we discussed above the nature of the coverage fraction varying among the lines .",
    "this effect can result from a number of causes .",
    "if , for example , we were to see a different @xmath17 for and , we could explain this result if the ionization or the optical depth varies between different lines - of - sight through the alr",
    ". it will be possible to test which of these effects is dominant by studying @xmath17 deduced from lines of different ions and different lines due to the same ion . we note that if this model is valid , then even the two members of the  doublet will have different @xmath17 , making the determination of @xmath17 and the column densities even more problematic .",
    "furthermore , one would expect @xmath17 to also change in a time variable system if the variability is due to a change in ionization level , _",
    "i.e. _ as the fractional abundance of an ion varies so does the optical depth in the line .",
    "this effect can be tested using high resolution spectra of a time variable absorption system ( as seen in the qso 2343 + 1232 , @xcite . )",
    "none of the seven methods mentioned in the introduction are conclusive tests for intrinsic vs. intervening systems .",
    "for example , in the qso 2116 - 358 , @xcite show a system which suggests partial coverage of the bel in the  @xmath101206 line ; yet the same system does not show absorption from excited fine structure lines and thus must be a large distance ( @xmath511 kpc ) from the qso nucleus",
    ". it will be necessarily to investigate these seven qualities statistically in many objects to determine how best to discriminate intrinsic absorbers .",
    "an excess of @xmath52 systems in radio - loud quasars relative to radio - quiet quasars has been noted by previous studies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that a @xmath52 system in a radio - loud quasar shows a property ( namely @xmath53 ) in common with other intrinsic systems seen in radio - quiet quasars .",
    "while there is an excess of @xmath52 systems in radio - loud quasars , there is a definite lack of @xmath8 systems ( _ i.e. _ bals . )",
    "recent work on high redshift radio galaxies has shown a frequent occurrence @xmath52 lyman-@xmath1 absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large fraction of galaxies with such absorption ( 60% ) implies that the absorbing gas is intrinsic to the host galaxy .",
    "long - slit spectra show that the absorbing region extends over the entire emitting region ( up to @xmath450 kpc . )",
    "also , a correlation is found between the size of the radio jet and the lyman-@xmath1 emitting region .",
    "what is the connection between the radio jet and the gas giving rise to associated absorption ?",
    "why is there a lack of accelerated ( @xmath8 ) intrinsic systems in radio bright sources ?",
    "how are the emitting and absorbing regions related in quasars ?",
    "we may be able to answer these questions by identifying and studying intrinsic systems in both radio - loud and radio - quiet objects .",
    "in this paper we have presented high resolution spectroscopy of the @xmath6 intrinsic absorption system in the radio quasar pks 0123 + 057 .",
    "the data are consistent with the conclusion that the background light source ( which in this case includes both the continuum and broad emission - line region ) is not fully occulted by the gaseous region causing this absorption .",
    "this is deduced both from the profile of the ly-@xmath1 absorption line and the residual intensities of the doublet .",
    "the derived coverage fractions , @xmath17 , of the strongest absorption lines are inversely proportional with the strength of the corresponding emission - lines , which indicates that the absorption - line region obscures no more than about 88% of the light from the emission - line region .",
    "furthermore , the coverage fractions measured for the weaker lines are consistent with a model where the absorption - line region is inhomogeneous through the various lines - of - sight towards the emission - line region which pass through the absorbing gas .",
    "this model shows that , for weak lines , the calculated value of @xmath17 decreases with the depth of the absorption line .",
    "these effects mean that the optical depths measured using the assumption that the absorbing gas homogeneously and completely covers the background light source would significantly underestimate the true column density through the absorption - line region . furthermore , the degree to which the column densities are underestimated will vary with the strength of the absorption line .",
    "accurate analyses of metal abundances in the gaseous environment near qsos using intrinsic absorption systems must necessarily account for these factors .",
    "we thank t. bida and r. campbell of keck observatory for obtaining these data via service observing .",
    "we are grateful to f. hamann , v. junkkarinen , and r. cohen for useful discussions .",
