    "understanding the initial mass function ( imf ) is one of the most important problems of stellar astrophysics .",
    "the imf , together with the star formation history , dictates origin , evolution , and fate of the stellar populations , from individual clusters up to entire galaxies .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses has been studied in depth for more than half a century , starting with the pioneering work of @xcite ; the major open question is whether the imf is universal or if it depends on the initial conditions of star formation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whereas it is commonly accepted that the imf seems well reproduced by a power law for masses greater than several tenths of a solar mass , the shape and universality of the imf in the substellar mass regime is still under investigation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "very young clusters ( few myr old ) in star - forming regions provide a unique tool to investigate the imf across the entire mass spectrum , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , they are usually young enough that neither dynamical processes nor stellar evolution have altered the mass distribution ; therefore the measured distribution of stellar masses coincides with the imf .",
    "moreover , young low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( bds ) are in their brightest evolutionary stage when they contract towards the main sequence , therefore these objects are more easily detected and characterized when they are young .    among the nearby galactic star - forming regions ,",
    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) is an ideal site for the study of star formation in particular for low - mass stars and bds .",
    "this cluster counts a few thousand members , 1 - 3  myr old @xcite , spanning the entire mass spectrum ( @xmath4  m@xmath5 ) .",
    "several studies have been conducted in the past decade to measure the imf in the onc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; they generally find ( similar to the field star population ) a salpeter - like slope above 1  m@xmath5 , which flattens to a broad peak at 0.2 - 0.3  m@xmath5 ( though the shape and position of the imf peak is highly model dependent , @xcite ) , and the mass distribution likely decreases in the substellar mass range .",
    "determining masses in a young region such as the onc is not without difficulties : besides the strong nebular emission , another major impediment is caused by differential reddening , which has strongly limited the ability to derive the stellar parameters of individual sources based on photometry alone . to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "spectroscopic surveys have been carried out @xcite , but they are either limited to a fraction of the members , or to the very central part of the region , the trapezium cluster . using near - infrared ( nir ) photometry it is possible to asses stellar masses down to the planetary masses ( @xmath6  m@xmath7 ) , for example by de - reddening the measured color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) on one isochrone or even to deriving directly the imf from the nir luminosity functions ( lfs ) @xcite .",
    "this second approach , however , is not very accurate : the onc shows a significant luminosity spread , sometimes interpreted as a real age spread @xcite , and stars of different age follow different mass - luminosity relation .",
    "moreover the nir excess originating in the inner circumstellar disks @xcite alters the observed fluxes .",
    "clearly , in order to improve our knowledge of the onc imf , a precise and systematic characterization of the stellar parameters of individual members is needed . to this purpose ,",
    "the _ orion hst treasury program _",
    "@xcite has produced a high spatial resolution photometric survey of the onc with three instruments onboard the hubble space telescope , from @xmath8band to the nir , over a large field of view ( fov ) , with a sensitivity well into the bd mass range . to fully exploit this exceptional dataset , an accurate estimate of the effective temperature ( @xmath9 ) is needed to derive @xmath10 from the observed colors and therefore the stellar luminosities . in our previous works ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) we have collected spectral types from the literature and complemented them with new optical spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , we have presented a new observational technique , based on optical medium - band photometry at 6200  a wavelength where the spectra of cool stars show a deep , @xmath9-dependent tio absorption feature  to derive the spectral types of m - type sources .",
    "this allowed us to obtain the stellar parameters of @xmath11 members and derive the most complete hrd of the onc , down to the hydrogen burning limit .    in the present paper",
    "we extend our investigation to lower masses , well into the bd regime , and with higher completeness . to this purpose , we take advantage of the same observational strategy presented in paper  i , using medium - band photometry to derive spectral types of cool sources , from which @xmath9 and @xmath10 are derived , and place individual sources in the hrd . here , instead of the @xmath12 filter used in paper  i , we select two bands at longer optical wavelengths , in order to increase our sensitivity for cooler sources such as bds and further reduce the influence of extinction .    in section [ section :",
    "the_data ] we present our new observations , the data reduction and calibration . in section [ section : analysis ] we define two spectro - photometric indices based on our medium - band photometry . using available stellar parameters for a small sample of onc very - low mass stars and bds , we define empirical transformations to convert these indices into @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we also show that this technique is not significantly affected by optical excesses from mass accretion , typical of young stars and bds . in section",
    "[ section : hrd ] we derive the new hrd for the onc , which now includes @xmath13 sources , reaching masses as low as @xmath14 .",
    "we study the completeness as a function of @xmath9 and bolometric luminosity ( @xmath15 ) accounting for photometric detection as well as differential reddening ; we detect a population of candidate background contaminants , which appears well separated from the onc members in the hrd , at lower luminosity . after excluding the contaminants , in section [ section : imf ] we derive and discuss the imf of the onc .",
    "observations were carried out with the wide field imager ( wfi ) , a focal reducer - type camera mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 2.2-m mpg / eso telescope at la silla .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the camera is @xmath16 , allowing us to cover the entire onc with one pointing .",
    "this optical imager offers a particularly large set of broad- , medium- , and narrow - band filters along the entire wavelength range of its ccd sensitivity ( @xmath173000 to 10000@xmath18 ) .",
    "we selected two wfi medium band filters which provide the best sampling of a deep absorption band at @xmath19 .",
    "these are the mb@xmath20753/18-eso848 and the mb@xmath20770/19-eso849 filters , which hereafter will be simply referred to as _ 753 _ and _ 770_. figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the transmission profiles of these filters overlayed to synthetic spectra from @xcite of decreasing temperature . the @xmath21 band is centered on the photospheric continuum , while the 770 is completely covering the tio absorption band whose strength increases with decreasing @xmath22 .",
    "we also used a broad @xmath1-band filter , the bb@xmath20i/203-eso879 , to sample the stellar flux at redder wavelengths , in order to evaluate the photospheric reddening from dust extinction .",
    "this i - band filter is also used in our previous photometric studies of the onc ( paper  i and ii ) . table [ tab : bands ] summarizes the characteristics of the 3 filters .",

    "a standard dithering pattern has been applied , in order to cover the gaps between the 8 ccd chips of wfi and allow for cosmic ray and bad pixel removal .",
    "we did not carry out short exposures to avoid saturation for the bright sources , since the bright end of the onc has been studied well in detail by us in our previous works .",
    "dark , bias and flat field exposures were obtained before and after each night .",
    "we did not observe standard fields for photometric calibration , given the particular filters used in this program and the practicality of performing relative photometric calibration exploiting our large pre - existing data set on orion .",

    "1.3.5 package @xcite .",
    "this software automatically performs all common image reduction steps ( e.g. , correction for bias and flat fields ) , and the absolute astrometric calibration of the individual exposures to be merged .",
    "this is accomplished by cross - correlating the images with a reference astrometric catalog ; we utilized to this purpose our previous wfi photometric catalog presented in paper  i. the final product of our image reduction is 3 images , one for each filter , obtained by merging all the individual exposures .",
    "table [ tab : observations ] summarizes the total exposures times ; these about 1 hour for the broad band , and about 2.5 and 4 hours for the two medium bands ,    photometry , both aperture and point - spread - function ( psf ) , was performed using the daophot ii package @xcite .",
    "we computed the psf individually for every image , starting from a coadded sample of few hundreds bright and unsaturated sources , and then refining these with an iterative sigma - clipping method to reject psf stars with poor @xmath25 .",
    "photometry was computed on all the sources brighter than 3@xmath26 above the local sky background noise . in order to eliminate the contamination from spurious detections  a potentially significant fraction of the total detections , given the strong variability of the nebular background , and the low threshold for source detection ",
    "we rejected sources not present in any of our existing deep photometric catalogs of the onc , both ground based ( wfi @xmath27 , paper  i ; ctio / ispi @xmath28 , see @xcite ) or from the hst photometry ( acs @xmath29 , wfpc2 @xmath30 , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the significant depth of the infrared and hst data , over a fov equal or larger than that of the observations described here , guarantees that we are not excluding any real sources in this study .",
    "the photometry has been calibrated to the vegamag system using our previous wfi photometric catalog .",
    "for the @xmath1-band , we simply determined the photometric offset with respect to our previous photometry in the same filter .",
    "for the two medium bands , we used synthetic photometry .",
    "we considered the atmosphere models of @xcite as empirically calibrated by us in paper  ii , and computed the two medium - band colors @xmath31 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "then we considered the actual sources detected in all 3 bands and for which we have @xmath9 and @xmath10 from paper ii , and plotted the measured , extinction - corrected ( @xmath32 ) colors against @xmath9 .",
    "the systematic difference between these colors ( considered individually ) and the synthetic ones is the offset needed to calibrate the medium bands .",
    "specifically , we limited to the stars with @xmath33  k , range where the possible inaccuracies of the atmosphere models are very modest .",
    "we derive the completeness functions for our wfi photometry with an artificial star test , performed separately for each wfi filter .",
    "artificial stars of different magnitude , are added on the reduced wfi images ; then , with the same technique used to detect and extract photometry on the real stars , these artificial stars are recovered or missed depending on their flux , local sky noise , crowding , etc .",
    "the fraction of recovered stars against the total , as a function of magnitude , provides the completeness .    in our onc imaging ,",
    "the completeness is spatially variable , being strongly affected by the nebular background , which is brighter at the center where the stellar density is higher .",
    "this correlation , if not accounted for , may bias the derived completeness .",
    "therefore , we first derive the spatial , projected , stellar density distribution of the onc .",
    "this is obtained by merging all catalogs at our disposal , in particular the deep ispi @xmath28 photometry and the hst / acs data .",
    "then , for every magnitude bin , the artificial stars are generated with random positions drawn from the 2 dimensional density distribution .",
    "the derived completeness functions are shown in figure [ fig : plot_completeness_mag ] . in all cases ,",
    "these curves show a characteristic trend : besides the typical steep cutoff at faint luminosities which traces the detection limit , the completeness shows a slow decrease below 1 at bright luminosities .",
    "this is due to the luminous nebular emission and significant crowding of the central part of the onc , where the detection limit is significantly poorer . in the outer regions of the onc , we are able to detect sources all the way down to @xmath34  mag in @xmath1 band ( see figure [ fig : cmd ] ) , and to @xmath35  mag in @xmath21 and @xmath3 .",
    "the final catalog includes 2474 sources with photometry in all 3 bands .",
    "the photometric errors as a function of magnitude are shown in figure [ fig : photometric_errors ] .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows our new cmd , highlighting the significant improvement in depth with respect to our previous work ( paper  ii ) . in particular , our photometry covers a very large range of stellar luminosities , spanning @xmath36  mag in @xmath1-band , and the new observations extend @xmath175  mag deeper than in the previous work , reaching @xmath37 , which corresponds to young sources with masses @xmath38  m@xmath5 at 1  myr ( see figure [ fig : cmd ] ) . in figure [ fig : cmd ] we also observe among the faintest sources a concentration of objects with @xmath39 which , as we show below , comprise a distant , background stellar population that is detectable despite the high extinction through the molecular cloud because of the depth of our observations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : color_color_diagram ] we present the @xmath40 vs @xmath41 color - color diagram , which forms the basis of our analysis in all that follows .",
    "the most salient feature of this diagram is the inflection point near ( 0.05,0.25 ) , from which the stars extend in two different directions . by comparison with the orientations of the synthetic isochrone and the extinction vector",
    ", we see that this inflection in the diagram essentially separates the stars into a group ( extending to the left ) that stretches mostly parallel to the isochrone and perpendicular to the reddening vector , and a second group ( extending to the upper right ) that stretches parallel to both the isochrone and the reddening vector .",
    "the inflection in the diagram occurs at @xmath42  k.    for stars with @xmath43  k ( i.e. spectral types @xmath44m0 ) , the @xmath41 color is both highly sensitive to @xmath9 , becoming rapidly bluer ( more negative ) as @xmath9 decreases ( see also figure [ fig : spectra ] ) , and largely insensitive to @xmath10 because of the small wavelength separation between the 753 and 770 bands . in our analysis below we exploit this property of the diagram to break the degeneracy between @xmath9 and @xmath10 for these very cool stars , which has previously been one of the most difficult challenges in the derivation of stellar parameters from optical broadband photometry for m - stars and bds ( @xcite ; paper  ii ) .",
    "we note here that the synthetic isochrone clearly does not correctly reproduce the slight upward curvature of the stars as one moves to the coolest @xmath9 , but because these cool stars nonetheless extend perpendicular to the reddening vector , we demonstrate below that the systematic error in the @xmath40 colors predicted by the synthetic isochrones can be readily calibrated out for @xmath43  k. we note also that the effects of contamination by faint background sources is mitigated in this region of the diagram , particularly for the coolest objects of interest ( @xmath45  k , i.e. , in the bds regime ) , since background bds are too intrinsically faint to penetrate the very high @xmath10 of the cloud behind the onc . as we show in section [ section : hrd ] , the relatively few remaining background contaminants in this region of the diagram ( mostly red giants ) can be filtered out on the basis of their luminosity .",
    "these desirable features of the @xmath40 vs @xmath41 color - color diagram break down for warmer stars with @xmath46  k. for these warmer stars the colors are largely degenerate in @xmath9 and moreover the isochrone and the reddening vector are parallel .",
    "for these stars we must therefore rely on previous observations by us and from the literature to determine @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , there is significant background contamination in this region of the diagram ; as we show below , while the brightest of these stars are bona fide onc members , the faintest are mostly background stars .",
    "finally , we note that the apparent lack of low-@xmath10 stars for @xmath47  k is the result of these stars being saturated in our deep images .",
    "such stars are indeed present in the onc , and we include them in our analysis from our own previous work ( paper  i and ii ) .",
    "in order to derive the stellar parameters of very low - mass stars ( vlmss ) and bds in the onc , we focus our analysis on the left - hand part of the color - color diagram of figure [ fig : color_color_diagram ] , where the @xmath41 color anti - correlates with @xmath9 .",
    "our basic methodology is to project each source from its observed position in the color - color diagram back along the reddening vector to the theoretical isochrone .",
    "the choice of theoretical isochrone is largely arbitrary because none of the available isochrones exactly reproduce the observed distribution of the stars in the diagram , and consequently we must empirically recalibrate the isochrone based on the observed distribution .",
    "our assumption is that , whichever fiducial isochrone is adopted , the non - reddened stars should lie on the isochrone , and the reddened stars displaced away from it along the reddening vector .",
    "for example , the isochrone shown in figure [ fig : color_color_diagram ] computed using the synthetic spectra of @xcite predicts a much bluer @xmath40 index than our data for low @xmath41 .",
    "if the model were correct , this would imply an unrealistic dependence of the average @xmath10 on @xmath9 , in the sense that the minimum measured extinction ( i.e. the distance , along the reddening vector , between the isochrone and the stars ) increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "different synthetic isochrones can lead to more realistic predictions of colors .",
    "figure [ fig : color_color_models ] shows our color - color diagram with a number of synthetic isochrones , computed using both the ames - mt spectra of @xcite and the most recent grid  the bt - settle models  from @xcite .",
    "we also show an isochrone ( red line ) derived using the @xcite atmospheres as recalibrated by us in paper  ii . that calibration , appropriate for the onc , involved an empirical constraint on the stellar @xmath48 to produce a synthetic isochrone that matched the observed broadband colors of the onc in @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear that all synthetic isochrones , including that which we used in paper  ii , are incompatible with the data in this new medium - band color - color plane .",
    "ames - mt consistently predicts a systematically lower @xmath40 at low @xmath9 , and bt - settle predicts either a turn - over in @xmath41 for low @xmath48 ( young isochrones ) or @xmath40 colors that are too red for high @xmath48 ( the zams model ) .",
    "evidently , current synthetic models , even those that have been empirically calibrated by us to match the broadband colors of young low - mass stars , are unable to correctly reproduce the molecular feature at @xmath50and / or the photospheric continuum level at @xmath51  which form the basis of our new medium - band color - color diagram technique . as a consequence , we must empirically define an isochrone representing both the photospheric colors in our bands and the @xmath9 scale along it .",
    "to proceed , we introduce a new set of coordinates in the color - color plane of figure [ fig : color_color_diagram ] .",
    "we define the @xmath52 $ ] as the distance that a given star is displaced , along the reddening vector , from the @xmath53axis of the color - color diagram , measured in units of @xmath10 : @xmath54= & \\bigg(m_{753}-i\\bigg)\\bigg/\\bigg(\\frac{a_{753}}{a_v}-\\frac{a_i}{a_v}\\bigg)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( values computed from the @xcite reddening law for @xmath58 ) .",
    "we choose the reddening parameter @xmath58 instead of a higher value ( e.g , 5.5 , @xcite ) because , as we found in paper  ii , this value better explains the observed broadband colors of the onc members .",
    "we similarly define the @xmath59 $ ] as the projection of a given star , along the direction of the reddening vector , onto the x - axis [ i.e. @xmath60 : @xmath61= & m_{753}\\cdot\\bigg[1-\\big(\\frac{a_{753}}{a_v}-\\frac{a_{770}}{a_v}\\big)/\\big(\\frac{a_{753}}{a_v}-\\frac{a_{i}}{a_v}\\big)\\bigg ] + \\nonumber   \\\\ & + i\\cdot\\bigg[\\big(\\frac{a_{753}}{a_v}-\\frac{a_{770}}{a_v}\\big)/\\big(\\frac{a_{753}}{a_v}-\\frac{a_{i}}{a_v}\\big)\\bigg ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & - m_{770}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by definition , the @xmath59 $ ] is reddening independent , and so it depends only on @xmath9 .",
    "figure [ fig : color_color_indexes ] shows a schematic representation of the two indices in the color - color diagram .",
    "because the currently available synthetic spectra are unable to accurately predict the stellar colors in our medium - band color - color diagram , we must derive an empirical transformation between the @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath9 .",
    "to this end we utilize the sample of onc stars with directly determined ( i.e. spectroscopic ) spectral types . with the appropriate transformation between the @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath9",
    ", we will be able to reliably determine @xmath9 of all the other members from their measured [ @xmath62 .",
    "we have assembled all available optical spectral types from our paper  ii ( for stellar - mass objects ) and nir spectral types ( for substellar - mass objects ) from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectral types were converted to @xmath9 using the temperature scale of @xcite , as we did in paper  ii .",
    "figure [ fig : index_teff ] shows the resulting relationship between our measured [ @xmath62 and the spectroscopically determined @xmath9 .",
    "as expected , for late spectral subtypes the @xmath59 $ ] becomes bluer ( i.e. becomes more negative ) with @xmath9 .",
    "this approximately linear dependence holds from @xmath63  k ( @xmath17m2.5 ) down to the coldest available spectral types for bds , and down to our photometric lower limit ( @xmath59\\simeq0.8 $ ] ) .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , we found that the scatter in the [ @xmath62@xmath9 relation could be significantly reduced if we consider only sources that do not show strong spectroscopic evidence of accretion .",
    "we selected the ",
    "non - accretors \" on the basis of low h@xmath64 emission ( e.w.@xmath65 ) from paper  i and low optical veiling ( low @xmath66band excess emission ) from paper  ii . figure [ fig : index_teff ] shows that these non - accretors form a relatively tight sequence , while the rest of the stars ( the accretors ) are much more scattered in the diagram .",
    "the accretors are also systematically shifted to higher @xmath9 and/or lower [ @xmath62 , indicating that accretion alters the position of the sources in the diagram , and indeed below we exploit this feature to quantify the degree to which accretion may affect our determination of @xmath9 .    using only the sample of non - accretors , we derive an empirical linear relation between @xmath9 and the @xmath59 $ ] : @xmath67 \\cdot1150~{\\rm k}\\ ] ] which is valid for @xmath59<-0.1 $ ] .",
    "the standard deviation of the data relative to this relation is @xmath68  k , roughly corresponding to one - half of a spectral subtype .",
    "this is comparable to the overall uncertainty in our spectroscopically determined @xmath9 from paper  ii , suggesting that this scatter is principally due to uncertainty in the ( spectroscopic ) spectral types , and therefore any additional uncertainty introduced through the @xmath59$]@xmath9 transformation is negligible .",
    "the analysis methodology utilizing our medium - band color - color diagram is predicated on the assumption that the stellar colors in our photometric bands depend only on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , permitting us to establish an empirical relationship between the our [ @xmath62 and @xmath9 ( equation [ equation : teff_vs_index ] ) .",
    "however , the colors of young stars can be affected by accretion , whereby infalling matter from the circumstellar disk onto the stellar surface leads to a flux excess , strongest in the uv and in specific emission lines , but also to a smaller extent in the continuum at optical wavelengths .",
    "the latter is typically characterized by a heated photosphere covering @xmath171% of the stellar surface and with @xmath69  k , therefore peaking in the b - band @xcite . since our",
    "photometry uses filters at the red end of the optical spectrum , and there are no emission lines within the wavelength range covered by our filters , we expect that accretion should induce only a modest alteration of our measured colors .",
    "we investigate this hypothesis in a quantitative way , calculating the shift in [ @xmath62 , at constant @xmath9 , obtained by contaminating the photospheric fluxes with varying degrees of accretion luminosity . as in paper",
    "ii , where we performed a similar modeling to derive the change in the @xmath49 colors due to mass accretion , we first model a typical accretion spectrum , then we add it with increasing relative flux fraction on synthetic stellar spectra of different @xmath9 .",
    "finally , by means of synthetic photometry as above , we compute the resulting changes in the @xmath59 $ ] and in turn the error induced in the inferred @xmath9 . specifically , we simulated a typical accretion spectrum using the cloudy photoionization code .",
    "this is similar to that we used in paper  ii , but has been further refined to provide a more realistic sed in the ultraviolet range ( manara et al .",
    "2011 , _ in prep .",
    "we use the synthetic spectra that we used in paper  ii  namely the empirically calibrated ames - mt model from @xcite  and for every @xmath9 we add a component of our accretion spectrum to the photospheric spectra , varying the ratio @xmath70 . the result is shown in figure [ fig : index_teff_accretion ] , from which two main results are evident : first , contaminating the stellar flux with accretion excess shifts the [ @xmath62 to higher values , and the effect is more prominent for cooler @xmath9 .",
    "this is intuitive considering that this index traces the ratio between the flux outside ( @xmath71 ) and inside ( @xmath50 ) the tio molecular feature .",
    "the accretion - induced continuum excess partially `` fills in '' the tio absorption feature , leading to higher ( less negative ) values of [ @xmath62 .",
    "second , for typical values of accretion luminosities in a pms cluster ( @xmath72 ) the shift in the [ @xmath62 is negligible . from figure [ fig : index_teff_accretion ] it also appears that the synthetic isochrone does not quite follow our data .",
    "this is not surprising , given that , as discussed in section [ section : the_data ] , this model provides a somewhat inaccurate estimate of the stellar fluxes in our medium bands ( see figure [ fig : color_color_models ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a correct , quantitative assessment of the accretion - induced shift in the [ @xmath62 , we must recalibrate the results shown in figure [ fig : index_teff_accretion ] .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the systematic error in the depth of the tio feature as a function of @xmath9 can be treated as a simple systematic error in the @xmath9 scale .",
    "for example , for the lowest @xmath9 modeled in figure [ fig : index_teff_accretion ] ( @xmath73  k ) , the models predict a depth of the tio feature corresponding to [ @xmath62@xmath74  mag , and by adding @xmath75 of accretion luminosity one obtains a shift of the index of @xmath76  mag .",
    "in fact , from figure [ fig : index_teff ] and equation [ equation : teff_vs_index ] , [ @xmath62@xmath74  mag corresponds to a lower @xmath9 , about 2700  k. therefore we can associate this @xmath9 with a shift of @xmath76  mag .",
    "then , we readjust the ratio @xmath77 , using the updated @xmath9 , according to @xmath78 . finally , we can recast the result from a more observational perspective , in which we measure [ @xmath62 for a given star and we do not know the true value of @xmath79 for that star .",
    "deriving @xmath9 via equation [ equation : teff_vs_index ] , which is defined for @xmath80 , we will overestimate the true @xmath9 because accretion will cause the tio feature to be filled - in and consequently we will measure a higher [ @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ fig : accretion_bias ] shows the resulting systematic overestimation of the derived @xmath9 for various @xmath79 .",
    "we find again that the lower the stellar @xmath9 , the larger the error in the @xmath9 estimate due to accretion .",
    "however , if one excludes very strong accretors ( @xmath82 ) , the error in @xmath9 is very small .",
    "for instance , for @xmath83 , the @xmath9 error is always smaller than half spectral subtype , and always @xmath84  k above the h - burning limit ( @xmath85  k ) .",
    "the @xmath9 difference associated to an error of 1 spectral type was computed as the difference between the temperature of two contiguous spectral subtypes .",
    "similarly , the @xmath9 differences corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 spectral subtypes ( dotted lines in figure [ fig : accretion_bias ] ) is equal to that for 1 spectral type , scaled down by a factor of 2 and 4 .    in conclusion , the presence of optical excess due to accretion has a negligible effect on the stellar parameters derived from our medium - band survey .",
    "thus , we will neglect accretion in the following analysis , and proceed to derive @xmath9 based on the [ @xmath62 from equation [ equation : teff_vs_index ] .      despite having shown that accretion excess not",
    "not alter significantly the measured [ @xmath62 , figure [ fig : index_teff ] showed that accreting onc sources are displaced in the @xmath9 vs. [ @xmath62 plane .",
    "the displacement is such that the accretors lie above the non - accretors , meaning that the spectroscopic @xmath9 plotted on the y - axis of figure [ fig : index_teff ] have been on average overestimated for accreting onc sources .",
    "this overestimation of spectroscopically determined @xmath9 for accreting sources is likely the result of incomplete removal of the optical veiling in the spectra of these sources .",
    "this excess , that we demonstrated above to be minimized at 7700(although it may still be present in extreme cases , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , is likely larger at bluer wavelengths , where other molecular features are typically used to measure the spectral types of m - type stars .",
    "this veiling , if not removed or if incompletely removed , will fill in the molecular absorption lines and lead to a systematic overestimation of the spectral types .    by utilizing the [ @xmath62 to derive @xmath9 we are instead largely immune to these effects , and we are now able to correct the previous spectroscopically derived @xmath9 via equation equation [ equation : teff_vs_index ] .    in conclusion , our technique to measure stellar @xmath9 is able to derive a more accurate estimate of @xmath9 than optical spectroscopy , being less biased by a possible veiling excess .           in section [ subsection",
    ": teff_calibration ] we derived an empirical relation between the @xmath59 $ ] and the stellar @xmath9 , and in section [ subsection : accretion ] we explored the effects of accretion luminosity on there derivations . here ,",
    "similarly , we find the relation between the @xmath52 $ ] , obtained in equation [ equation : avindex ] , and the actual extinction @xmath10 of the onc stars , in magnitudes . in the color - color diagram ,",
    "the extinction @xmath10 of a star is the distance , along the reddening direction , between the observed position and the isochrone , whereas the [ @xmath88 is the distance , also along the same direction and scaled by the appropriate @xmath89 , between the observed colors and the abscissa @xmath90 .",
    "therefore the [ @xmath91 and the true @xmath10 differ only by a constant , which depends on the [ @xmath62 ( i.e. , it is a function of @xmath9 ) .    to this end , we plot the extinction - corrected onc stars with independent @xmath10 estimates from paper  ii and from @xcite in the [ @xmath88 vs. [ @xmath62 plane ( figure [ fig : aindex_calib ] , left - hand panel ) .",
    "we also use the ispi @xmath28 photometry of the onc presented in @xcite , from which we use stars with the lowest @xmath9 ( low @xmath59 $ ] ) and with the smallest photometric errors . for the coolest @xmath9 considered here ,",
    "the @xmath92 vs @xmath93 isochrone from @xcite is vertical , and its color ( @xmath94 ) is independent of age , therefore @xmath10 can be derived by simply dereddening the sources on the isochrone . by not including the @xmath95-band photometry from @xcite , the infrared - derived extinctions should not be strongly affected by the possible presence of disk excess .",
    "the thick line in the figure is our fit to the data , i.e. , the empirical isochrone corresponding to @xmath10=0 .",
    "this also represents the offset to be subtracted from the measured @xmath52 $ ] , as a function of the [ @xmath62 , to compute the true @xmath10 .    among the points in figure [",
    "fig : aindex_calib ] from our previous paper  ii , we can distinguish accreting sources from non - accretors , just as in figure [ fig : index_teff ] . in section [",
    "subsection : teff_calibration ] we suggested that previous spectroscopically derived @xmath9 estimates are systematically overestimated for accreting members in the m - type range .",
    "this is now confirmed by figure [ fig : aindex_calib ] : whereas the extinction - corrected non - accretors lie on a curve consistent with the lower edge of the non extinction - corrected population ( right panel of the same figure ) , for accretors we find @xmath10 estimates systematically overestimated .",
    "this is because if @xmath9 is overestimated , the intrinsic colors are underestimated , and therefore the color excess attributed to extinction is overestimated leading to higher @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : aindex_calib ] , right - hand panel , shows again the empirically calibrated isochrone ( i.e. , for @xmath96 ) , together with all the stars in our catalog . unlike in the left - hand panel , we have not subtracted the extinction here .",
    "overall the population lies above the line , i.e. , at positive values of @xmath10 .",
    "as would be expected if the isochrone is correct , the distribution of sources above the isochrone also appears uniform for different @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "there is an overabundance of highly reddened stars at the highest useful limit of the index ( @xmath59 = -0.1 $ ] ) , i.e. , at the highest limit of the @xmath9 range accessible with our medium - band photometry .",
    "this , as will be shown below , is a residual late - type background contaminant population .",
    "having derived two empirical relations , one to obtain the @xmath9 from the @xmath59 $ ] for stars in the spectral subtype range m3m8.5 , the other to derive @xmath10 once the @xmath59 $ ] is known , we now derive the stellar parameters for the sources in our catalog .",
    "sources lying below the isochrone of figure [ fig : aindex_calib]b appear to have negative extinctions , which is unphysical ; 93 stars showing an extinction in the range @xmath97  mag@xmath980  mag are therefore assigned @xmath96 , essentially shifting the measured colors to the closest physically meaningful solution .",
    "another few stars with @xmath99  mag were removed from the sample , being likely spurious detections or faint sources with very inaccurate photometry .",
    "the fraction of sources showing negative extinction ( about 5% ) is much smaller than in previous works ( e.g. , paper  ii or @xcite ) , validating the improved accuracy of our methods to derive stellar parameters . in total",
    ", we derived @xmath9 and @xmath10 for 1280 sources , whereas only 544 of them had a previously assigned @xmath9 . merging the new @xmath9 and @xmath10 with those of our previous work , our sample counts 1807 sources with both @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "from which we can derive an updated h - r diagram for the onc extending to well below the h - burning limit .      in order to convert the de - reddened magnitudes into @xmath100 , knowledge of the bolometric corrections ( bcs ) as a function of @xmath9",
    "is required .",
    "unfortunately , we can not rely for such relations on previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for several reasons : 1 ) the photometric bands used here , including @xmath101band , are non - standard ; 2 ) optical bcs usually do not extend in the bd temperature range ; and 3 ) if the optical stellar colors are age dependent , as suggested in paper  ii , the bcs may be also . thus , bcs valid for main - sequence dwarfs might not be adequate for a young populations such as the onc .",
    "instead , we use synthetic photometry to derive our bcs , according to the formula : @xmath102,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 are synthetic spectra , and @xmath104 the filter throughput .",
    "as we have shown above ( see also the discussion in paper  ii ) , current atmosphere models do not correctly predict the optical broad band colors for cool stars .",
    "this clearly affects the computation of bcs , in particular bcs in @xmath101band , @xmath105 . on the other hand , the bolometric flux for a given synthetic spectrum will be trivially correct at a given @xmath9 since , by definition , @xmath106 .",
    "the radii @xmath107 , which could also be inaccurate from the evolutionary models , do not affect the bcs since they introduce an identical proportionality factor in both the numerator and denominator of equation [ equation : bc ] .    from the comparison of our data with the synthetic isochrones ( see figure [ fig : color_color_models ] )",
    "we can not ascertain the correctness of the synthetic @xmath1-band fluxes .",
    "it is true that the isochrones are unable to reproduce the data in the color - color diagram , but the shortcomings may be principally in our medium bands and not in the @xmath1-band . at the same time , the bt - settle models @xcite have been validated in the nir for dwarf stars , such that the predicted @xmath92 and @xmath95 fluxes match the observations down to bd masses .",
    "thus , if the predicted @xmath101band magnitudes are also correct , we would expect the predicted @xmath108 color to be also consistent with the observations across all @xmath9 .",
    "we perform this test using the @xmath92-band photometry of the onc from @xcite , together with our @xmath101band magnitudes and ( as in section [ subsection : av_calibration ] ) the @xmath10 estimates from previous works .",
    "figure [ fig : ij_vs_teff ] shows the dereddened @xmath108 color as a function of @xmath9 for our onc sample , in comparison with the same quantity computed using the bt - settle atmospheres , assuming a @xcite 1  myr isochrone to constrain the surface gravity as a function of @xmath9 . as in figure [ fig : ij_vs_teff ] , we highlight sources showing no or little accretion excess , except at the coolest @xmath9 ( @xmath109  k ) , for which we do not have estimates of accretion from paper  ii . for @xmath110",

    "however , the match is worse at lower @xmath9 , the isochrone predicting lower @xmath108 than shown by our data .",
    "we checked that this conclusion is not strongly dependent on @xmath48 .",
    "trusting the predicted @xmath111band fluxes , as explained above , we conclude that the bt - settle atmosphere models tend to systematically overestimate the @xmath101band fluxes , and this effect is larger for cooler @xmath9 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ij_vs_teff ] we also show the empirical fit to the data .",
    "the difference between the two lines represents the empirical correction needed to calibrate the predicted @xmath1-band synthetic photometry using the bt - settle models . whereas this is small for @xmath112  k , in the bd @xmath9 range the correction increases up to 1 magnitude",
    "thus , we correct the computed bcs , derived from equation [ equation : bc ] , applying this offset as a function of @xmath9 .    finally , we derive the bolometric luminosities for all our sources from : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the absolute magnitude , in wfi @xmath1 band , of the sun",

    "the apparent discontinuity in the number of sources around @xmath118 is mainly due to the much higher completeness in the number of low - mass stars with @xmath9 estimates provided by the present work ( see section [ subsection : completenesshrd ] ) .      despite the large column density of the orion molecular cloud , which produces an extinction up to @xmath119  mag @xcite , contamination from background",
    "stellar populations starts to become non negligible at faint magnitudes in the onc .",
    "in fact , as suggested by previous works , ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fraction of background contaminants versus members increases towards the substellar mass range in the onc .",
    "this is both due to the increase in the number of faint background sources seen through the orion molecular cloud , and the decrease of actual members of the young cluster in the bd mass range , because of the declining initial mass function ( imf ) at substellar masses ( see below ) .",
    "the contamination from background sources is evident as a large number ( @xmath120200 stars ) of faint sources in our h - r diagram ( figure [ fig : hrd ] ) , which are well separated from the cluster sequence .",
    "given the relatively low @xmath9 for these objects ( @xmath121  k@xmath122  k ) , they could be either cool dwarf stars or red giants , the latter more easily detectable at large distances and through the orion molecular cloud .",
    "the relative number of these sources , relative to young cluster members , becomes dominant at our detection limit",
    ".    a small number of these relatively less - luminous sources might be actual onc members , whose flux may be masked ( e.g. , by edge - on circumstellar disks ) , and therefore are visible only in scattered light . this phenomenon has been observed in several young star - forming regions ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; however the expected fraction of such objects is very small , including no more than a few percent of the population @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the faint sources we detect below the young sequence are about 16% of the total number of stars with @xmath123  k. therefore , we can assume that most of these sources are actually contaminants .",
    "moreover , removing a small fraction of faint members erroneously considered as background contaminants will not affect significantly the imf derived in this work , given the small expected number of these objects compared to the entire studied population .",
    "we proceed to attempt to remove the background contamination from the h - r diagram . to this purpose",

    "figure [ fig : contaminants_radec ] presents the spatial distribution of contaminants in comparison with that of the candidate members .",
    "whereas the latter are centrally concentrated , with an evident north - south elongation , contaminants appear uniformly distributed .",
    "also , we find a slight overabundance of contaminants on the east side of our field of view .",
    "the reason for this is that the extinction provided by the orion nebula is higher on a central north - south strip , centered on the onc @xcite .",
    "therefore the density of background objects is expected to be higher on the two sides of this band . here",
    ", the nebular emission of the omc is significantly brighter on the west side of our fov , and this decreases the detection limit in this area .",

    "[ fig : hrd_with_models ] we present once again the h - r diagram of the onc , now including only our candidate members , together with pms evolutionary models .",
    "in particular , we use isochrones and tracks from either @xcite or @xcite . these models , unlike e.g.",
    ", the @xcite or the @xcite , also extend into the substellar mass range , and therefore are more suitable for our sample , which reaches masses as low as 0.02  m@xmath5 ( 20m@xmath125 ) .      in section [ subsection :",
    "photometric_completeness ] we have derived the photometric completeness of our survey . starting from this result , we now evaluate the completeness function in the h - r diagram .",
    "to do this , we transform the h - r diagram ( i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath126 ) into our observational space ( i.e. , the 753 , 770 , and @xmath1-band magnitudes ) , and assess the extent to which reddening causes sources of various intrinsic @xmath9 and @xmath126 to be missed in our survey .",
    "we set a uniform , dense grid of @xmath127 and @xmath126 bins in the h - r diagram , limited to the region @xmath128 . for each bin , we apply in reverse the relations derived in section [ subsection : teff_calibration ] and [ subsection : av_calibration ] to derive from @xmath9 and @xmath126 the @xmath59 $ ] , the @xmath52 $ ] , and ( using the bc ) the unreddened @xmath1-band magnitude , @xmath129 .",
    "then , by inverting equation [ equation:770index ] and [ equation : avindex ] , we also derive the magnitudes @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "thus we have associated to each pair of h - r diagram parameters ( @xmath127,@xmath126 ) the triplet of intrinsic magnitudes ( @xmath132@xmath131,@xmath129 ) for @xmath96 .",
    "next we apply reddening to these magnitudes using the empirical reddening distribution of the onc stellar population . as in paper",
    "ii , we limit ourselves to the most luminous half of the onc population , as these stars sample the full range of @xmath10 . with a monte carlo approach ,",
    "we draw 1000 @xmath10 values from the reddening distribution and apply them to the intrinsic magnitudes ( @xmath132@xmath131,@xmath129 ) associated to each point of the h - r diagram . for every @xmath133-th ( @xmath134 ) triplet of reddened magnitudes ,",
    "we compute the photometric completeness @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",
    "the product of these three , @xmath138 , averaged over the 1000 values of @xmath10 , provides the `` differential reddening normalized '' completeness for that particular bin in the h - r diagram .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : completeness_hrd]a .",
    "we find that the completeness is mainly dependent on @xmath126 , while its dependence on @xmath9 for a given luminosity is small and appears only at low temperatures ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "we note also that the completeness is rather high ( @xmath140 ) at the low - mass end of our catalog , and thus even without correcting for the completeness , the observed number of onc members in the substellar mass range is correct to within a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "our h - r diagram also includes sources whose stellar parameters are taken from paper  ii instead of our new medium - band photometry . for all members with @xmath141 , we simply adopt the completeness function in the hrd derived in that paper .",
    "in addition , there is a group of stars with @xmath142 but which are not present in our new medium - band photometry and thus whose stellar parameters are from paper  ii .",
    "the presence of these sources increases the overall completeness in this region of the hrd relative to that computed as above . to account for this",
    ", we divide the hrd into a grid with spacing 0.01  dex in @xmath127 and 0.1  dex in @xmath126 , and we count in each bin the relative number of sources from paper  ii versus members classified from our new data .",
    "this ratio , smoothed in @xmath127 and @xmath126 , is added to the completeness shown in figure [ fig : completeness_hrd]a .    the final result is shown in figure [ fig : completeness_hrd]b .",
    "the evident discontinuity in completeness at @xmath143 is due to the fact that for larger @xmath9 the stellar parameters are obtained from optical spectroscopy on an incomplete fraction of sources .",
    "from the two - dimensional completeness shown in figure [ fig : completeness_hrd]b , we are able to assign a completeness correction to each our sources , allowing us finally to derive a completeness corrected initial mass function for the onc .",

    "[ table : parameters ] we present the derived stellar parameters for the onc sources , using both sets of models .    from these masses ,",

    ", we account for its exact completeness by adding the inverse of the completeness of each source .",
    "we associate an uncertainty distribution to each measured value of @xmath158 equal to a possion distribution of mean @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the number of sources in the @xmath161th bin , scaled by a factor equal to the overall completeness correction for that bin . we stress that , strictly speaking , our mass function is actually a `` system '' mass function rather than a proper `` initial '' mass function , in the sense that we do not account for unresolved binaries or multiple systems .",
    "this , however , does not influence significantly our results , since the binary fraction ( accounting both bound systems and visual binaries ) in orion is small ( @xmath162 , @xcite ) , and about half of these are separated more than 1 , therefore resolved in our observations .",
    "it it well established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the imf generally follows a power - law in the intermediate- and high - mass range ( @xmath163 ) , whereas for low - mass stars and bds  which is the region of the mass spectrum most relevant for our study  this function can be approximated with a shallower power law @xmath164 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or with a log - normal distribution @xmath165 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use both forms to fit our measured imf in the onc .",
    "we use a monte carlo simulation following @xcite to account for the uncertainties in the measured star counts , as follows .",
    "for every mass bin , we consider the error bars with their statistical distribution , and generate a large number ( @xmath166 ) of points drawn from the error distribution .",
    "then an unweighted fit is run on all these ( @xmath167 times the number of bins ) points .",
    "the best - fit parameters are isolated using a levenberg - marquard minimization algorithm .",
    "the uncertainty associated to the parameters has been computed with a sampling technique as follows : for every one of the @xmath168 bins , we randomly consider only one of the @xmath167 values previously simulated , i.e. a random sample from the distribution describing the error bar of the bin , and we fit the imf function on these @xmath168 data points , deriving the best - fit parameters . by iterating this selection and fit process 1000 times , we derive 1000 sets of parameters .",
    "the standard deviation of each parameter for the 1000 tests is the uncertainty in the estimate of the parameter itself .",
    "the resulting fitted functions for both sets of evolutionary models are shown in figure [ fig : imf ] . in table",
    "[ table : imf ] the fitting parameters are reported : the characteristic mass and the width for the log - normal fit , and the two power law slopes as well as the break point for the 2-phase power law . we find that the two families of evolutionary models lead to significant differences in the derived imf . whereas the baraffe tracks produce a smooth distribution , which appears well fitted by a log - normal distribution characterized by a continuous change in the imf slope , the @xcite models lead to a more peaked distribution , with an evident maximum at @xmath169  m@xmath5 .",
    "the reason for this difference can be attributed to the different shapes of the evolutionary tracks in the very low mass range ( @xmath170  m@xmath171  m@xmath5 ) , where the models of @xcite predict a larger area of the hrd covered by adjacent tracks .",
    "the shape of the imf derived from the @xcite models does not depend significantly on which method we adopt for inclusion of very young stars lying above 1  myr isochrone ( see above ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : imf ] we also compare our measured mass distribution with standard reference imfs . in particular we consider the disk imf from @xcite which is expressed as a log - normal function , with a characteristic mass of either 0.079  m@xmath5 or 0.22  m@xmath5 respectively for the `` single objects '' imf or the `` system '' imf , the latter not corrected for stellar multiplicity . also , we consider the universal imf of @xcite , which is a multi - phase power law with shallower slopes in the vlms and bd regime . depending on the assumed evolutionary models and the type of function fitted , our imf peaks in the range 0.1  m@xmath5 @xmath172 0.3  m@xmath5 ,",
    "the higher values being larger than that most often reported , even in the case of unresolved multiplicity .",
    "this finding , as well as the high dependence on the evolutionary model family used to derive stellar masses , is consistent with what we have found in our previous work ( paper  i ) limited to the stellar mass range .",
    "a striking feature of our imf is the steep decline in the bd mass range ( see figure [ fig : imf ] ) ; here our mass distribution is much lower than the standard imfs , implying a significant deficiency of substellar objects in the onc .",
    "we stress that this finding is not biased by detection incompleteness , given that the derived mass distribution has been corrected for completeness star by star , and the completeness function we have derived in section [ subsection : completenesshrd ] remains fairly high ( @xmath173 ) even in the bd mass range .",
    "moreover , even hypothesizing an overestimated completeness for the smallest masses in our sample , the relative scarcity of substellar members is evident up to about 0.1  m@xmath5 ; there simply are not many very cool , very low luminosity sources observed .",
    "such a steep decline of the mass function in the bd mass range differs also from imf determinations in other young regions .",
    "in fact the majority of young clusters have been reported to show substellar mass function compatible with the kroupa or the chabrier mass distributions .",
    "some examples are chamaeleon i @xcite , upper sco @xcite , the @xmath26 ori region @xcite , @xmath174 ori @xcite , ngc  6611 @xcite .",
    "similar findings have also been reported for older open clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in fact for the praesepe cluster , @xcite measure even an increasing imf down to @xmath175  m@xmath7 .",
    "previous studies of the imf in the onc also found a decrease in the relative number of members in the substellar mass range , both in absolute number and relative to the standard imfs .",
    "studies based on photometry alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the conversion of near infrared lfs , find a measured imf slope below the h - burning limit not steeper than @xmath176 , which is the shallowest value we derive assuming @xcite models , and up to 2 units flatter than what we derive with @xcite tracks .",
    "also , @xcite finds an imf for the onc rapidly decreasing below the h - burning limit , but then flattening in the bd mass range .",
    "@xcite reports a secondary peak in the mass distribution at about the deuterium burning limit ( @xmath177 m@xmath5 ) ; @xcite tentatively find a similar feature , although with less significance and at a slightly higher mass .",
    "this mass roughly corresponds to our detection limit .",
    "however , from our results , we do not find any evidence of either a flattening of the imf or an increasing number of sources for the lowest mass bins .",
    "we interpret this inconsistency as an inaccurate estimate of the background contamination in previous works , which we believe is much improved through the methodology that we have developed here .",

    "<S> we present a new census of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) over a large field of view ( @xmath0 ) , significantly increasing the known population of stellar and substellar cluster members with precisely determined properties . </S>",
    "<S> we develop and exploit a technique to determine stellar effective temperatures from optical colors , nearly doubling the previously available number of objects with effective temperature determinations in this benchmark cluster . </S>",
    "<S> our technique utilizes colors from deep photometry in the @xmath1-band and in two medium - band filters at @xmath2 and @xmath3  nm , which accurately measure the depth of a molecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars . from these colors </S>",
    "<S> we can derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better than one - half spectral subtype , and importantly this precision is independent of the extinction to the individual stars . </S>",
    "<S> also , because this technique utilizes only photometry redward of 750  nm , the results are only mildly sensitive to optical veiling produced by accretion . completing our census with previously available data , we place some 1750 sources in the hertzsprung - russel diagram and assign masses and ages down to 0.02 solar masses . at faint luminosities </S>",
    "<S> , we detect a large population of background sources which is easily separated in our photometry from the bona fide cluster members . the resulting initial mass function of the cluster has good completeness well into the substellar mass range , and we find that it declines steeply with decreasing mass . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a deficiency of newly formed brown dwarfs in the cluster compared to the galactic disk population . </S>"
