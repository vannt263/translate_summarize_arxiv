    "very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) provides the most accurate astrometric measurements of celestial objects currently attainable .",
    "vlbi astrometry has been used , among other applications , to : define the most nearly inertial reference frame available for the positions of celestial objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; tie an inertial ( extragalactic ) reference frame to a planetary ephemeris via observations of pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; characterize motions and other properties of the earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; study positions and motions of maser spots in galaxies as a means to estimate black - hole masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and distances to other galaxies @xcite ; and test general relativity via measurements of solar gravitational deflection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    "we describe the analysis of astrometric vlbi observations of the rs  cvn binary star i m  pegasi ( i m  peg ; ) , the radio - bright star which served as the `` guide star , '' and hence as the positional reference , for the nasa / stanford _ gravity probe  b _ ( ) experiment .",
    "was designed to measure the geodetic and frame - dragging effects predicted by general relativity ( see paper  i , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as manifested in secular changes in the spin - axis orientations of four gyroscopes placed within a spacecraft in a low - altitude , polar orbit about the earth .",
    "the spacecraft also had an on - board telescope equipped with a tracking system designed to keep the guide star , , at the center of the telescope field of view , and thereby provide a directional reference : the relativistic effects were estimated by measuring the drift rates in the spin - axis directions of the four gyroscopes relative to the direction to .",
    "thus , if any motions of  on the sky relative to an inertial frame were not accounted for sufficiently accurately , they could map directly into the gyro drift - rate signals and thereby corrupt the relativistic measurements .",
    "( ideally the guide star would have been a distant quasar , which could be treated as effectively motionless on the sky , rather than a star in our galaxy , but the on - board telescope could only track objects brighter than about 6th magnitude , so a relatively bright star was the only possible choice . a list of criteria that had to be met by the guide star , and a description of the selection process that led to the choice of , is in . )",
    "our vlbi observations of  were therefore undertaken to determine the motions of the star relative to an inertial frame so that the relativistic effects included in the gyro measurements could be properly separated .",
    "the goal of our vlbi observations was to determine , relative to an inertial frame , the proper motion of   with standard error 0.14   or less in each of the north - south and east - west directions .",
    "this accuracy goal was based upon an error projection for the full experiment prior to launch in april 2004 and the desire at the time for the uncertainty in the proper motion of  not to constitute a significant source of error for the experiment .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach for astrometric vlbi data analysis that we developed to meet the accuracy goal for .",
    "we then compare the results from this approach with the results from two well - established vlbi analysis techniques : phase - referenced mapping ( prm ) and `` phase connection '' followed by parametric model fitting ( pmf ) .",
    "our new approach is a combination of these two standard approaches that provides many of the benefits of each .",
    "all three approaches use _ differential _ vlbi astrometry , in which the target source ( i.e. , the source of astrometric interest ) is observed alternately with at least one extragalactic , compact reference source nearby on the sky to provide model corrections in the analysis of the target - source data . the way these corrections are applied differs among the approaches , but in all cases the astrometric measurements of the target source are relative to the position(s ) of the reference source(s ) .    in   [ vlbiobs ]",
    "we briefly describe the vlbi observables used in our analysis .",
    "we then discuss some basic aspects of the prm and pmf analysis techniques in   [ prmaps ] and   [ pmfit ] , respectively . in",
    "[ merged ] we describe our new `` merged '' analysis technique and then our implementation of it .",
    "we compare the results from the three techniques in ",
    "[ compare ] , and offer corresponding conclusions in   [ conclusion ] .",
    "in vlbi observations of a compact source , the total fringe phase ( or visibility phase , or interferometric phase , or simply `` phase '' ) , @xmath0 , is the phase at frequency @xmath1 and time @xmath2 that is associated with the difference in arrival times of signals received from the source at two antennas in a vlbi array .",
    "we describe @xmath0 as : @xmath3   + 2\\pi n(\\omega , t ) \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , the `` geometric delay , '' is the difference in the signal arrival times in vacuum at the two antennas ; @xmath5 represents the difference in the instrumental delays ( including clock behavior ) at the two antenna sites ; @xmath6 represents the difference in signal propagation times to the two antennas due to all atmospheric effects , including the contributions of the hydrostatic ( or `` dry '' ) atmospheric constituents , atmospheric water vapor , and the ionosphere ; @xmath7 is the delay contribution from source structure , i.e. , from the non - pointlike brightness distribution of the source ; @xmath8 represents the ( thermal ) noise contribution to the phase measurement ; and @xmath9 represents the integer number of `` ambiguities , '' or `` phase wraps , '' included in the measurement .",
    "information about the number of phase wraps associated with a fringe phase is not inherent to a measurement of fringe phase , and in general a measured fringe phase can be defined such that @xmath10 , or @xmath11 . there is a fringe phase associated with each antenna pair , or `` baseline , '' within the vlbi array .",
    "the `` fringe rate '' is the partial derivative of the fringe phase with respect to time .",
    "the `` multiband delay '' is a measured approximation of the group delay , which is the partial derivative of the fringe phase with respect to frequency .",
    "to lowest order ( i.e. , neglecting , e.g. , relativistic effects ) , the geometric delay is given by : @xmath12 \\label{geom}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath14 is the 3-dimensional vector between the two antennas of the baseline , and @xmath15 is the unit vector in the direction of the observed source .",
    "all of the astrometric information in the measured fringe phase is contained in @xmath4 .",
    "( while we do not show the relativistic contributions to @xmath4 in equation  [ geom ] , we do include those contributions throughout our analyses .",
    "we also account for earth motions relative to the solar - system barycenter during the time between signal arrival at the two antennas . )",
    "the model we used for @xmath6 can be more explicitly described by : @xmath16 where the `` @xmath17 '' subscript refers to site a ; @xmath18 is the propagation delay through the atmosphere at zenith under the assumption that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium ; @xmath19 is the additional propagation delay through the atmosphere at zenith due to tropospheric water vapor @xcite ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the `` mapping functions '' that project ( i.e. , scale ) the `` dry '' and `` wet '' delays at zenith to the line - of - site elevation , @xmath22 , of the observed source ; and @xmath23 denotes the line - of - site contribution of the ionosphere to phase delays in the direction of the observed source .",
    "the basic idea behind the prm technique is to use the data from the observed reference sources to account for otherwise unmodeled fluctuations in instrumental or atmospheric delays , as well as for other model errors .",
    "specifically , the `` residual '' fringe phases and rates , i.e. , the differences between the measured and a  priori model values of these quantities , are obtained for the reference sources and then temporally and sometimes also spatially interpolated to the observation time and sky position of the target source to estimate the effects of model errors on the target - source observables ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically the cycle time over which the reference sources and target source are observed is relatively short , from several seconds to several minutes . to the extent that reference - source structure",
    "is properly accounted for and the reference - source residuals are properly interpolated to the observation time and sky position of the target source , the remaining residual components in the target - source data can be attributed primarily to measurement noise , unmodeled target - source structure , and a position offset of the target source relative to the a priori model position .",
    "perhaps the most important feature of the prm technique is that the target - source data can be coherently integrated over the entire span of an observing session .",
    "thus , even very weak sources with flux densities well under 1 mjy can be detected and imaged with vlbi via this technique .",
    "henceforth in this paper , a `` scan '' refers to a single continuous observation of a particular source .",
    "fringe - phase and fringe - rate measurements from successive reference - source scans can provide proper model fringe - phase adjustments for intervening target - source data only if the change in the model errors between the scans is @xmath24 , so that the number of @xmath25 phase wraps between successive reference - source scans can be accurately tracked .",
    "for that reason , the cycle time over which the reference and target sources are observed should be as short as possible .",
    "on the other hand , the reference - source scans must be long enough to provide reliable fringe - phase measurements from single scans , and the scan times for the target source should be long enough to ensure sufficient coherent integration time over the course of the observing session to produce an image with acceptably high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "these trade - offs must be balanced to determine the `` optimum '' scan and cycle times in the observation schedule .",
    "another beneficial feature of the prm approach is that it is relatively quick and efficient for obtaining high - accuracy astrometry , in large part due to the software packages now readily available . in our analyses we used almost exclusively the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) provided by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) to produce our phase - referenced maps .",
    "we followed the guidelines of @xcite .",
    "specifically , we :    1 .   incorporated the instrumental phase and amplitude calibrations routinely provided in log files from individual antennas .",
    "we also unweighted faulty data based upon information in these files and from operator and correlator reports .",
    "incorporated an additional constant ( over time ) phase adjustment to the calibration for each antenna based upon `` fringe fitting '' ( via aips task fring ) of data from a selected reference scan .",
    "sometimes we used multiple reference scans to provide such phase calibration adjustments for all antennas .",
    "3 .   ran a `` global fringe fit '' ( via aips task fring ) on all reference - source data while applying the phase and amplitude calibrations obtained so far .",
    "4 .   ran aips task imagr , with the fits from step 3 as calibration , to generate `` self - cal '' maps of the reference sources ( see paper  ii , * ? ? ?",
    "we then used these self - cal maps to refine the amplitude and phase calibration as well as the data flagging .",
    "in general we repeated steps 3 and 4 several times .",
    "5 .   used aips task bpass to further refine the phase and amplitude calibrations as a function of frequency .",
    ".   used aips task imagr with the final calibrations from steps 1 through 5 to obtain a phase - referenced map of the target source .",
    "unfortunately , the use of the prm technique for astrometry also poses some challenges , especially for campaigns such as ours in which the observations are made over many years . for example , one must take great care to assure that model components such as site positions , antenna axis offsets , and earth orientation parameters ( eops , i.e. , x- and y- pole positions , ut1@xmath26utc , and nutation angles in longitude and obliquity ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) are modeled consistently and correctly throughout all observation sessions .",
    "( for example , if updated values of axis offsets for antennas are used in processing data from later observing sessions , then the new values will have to be incorporated into a re - analysis of data from earlier observing sessions to avoid possible systematic errors . ) furthermore , post - processing adjustments to model parameters can be quite cumbersome in some analysis packages , including aips , especially if the adjustments have to be made to a large number of experiments .",
    "in addition , without the use of multiple reference sources and special interpolation routines to handle the spatial ( in particular , elevation - angle ) dependencies of atmospheric delays , a simple temporal interpolation of reference - source fringe phases introduces model - correction errors that scale roughly with the angular separation between the reference source and the target source .",
    "thus the basic prm technique commonly loses viability for an angular separation between reference and target sources larger than a few degrees .",
    "finally , the prm technique offers no inherently good way to assess the effects of systematic errors ( such as those due to inaccurate modeling of the atmosphere ) .",
    "reliable estimates of the true accuracy of the astrometric results can therefore be difficult to obtain ( although see @xcite for a comprehensive assessment specifically for the vlba and evn arrays ) . our development and use of the `` merged '' technique described in ",
    "[ merged ] of this paper was motivated in part by our desire to overcome these drawbacks .",
    "the pmf technique for analysis of vlbi data is , in all implementations with which we are familiar , essentially the method of `` weighted - least - squares '' estimation . for each reference - source and target - source scan ,",
    "the total measured fringe phase and fringe rate are estimated for each baseline at an epoch near the center of the scan period .",
    "any @xmath25 `` phase jumps '' between successive phase measurements are then resolved ( or flagged as unresolvable ) for each source and baseline .",
    "the overall integer number of @xmath25 differences between the phases from different sources is also resolved .",
    "finally , the complete collection of `` phase - connected '' data is fit to a model in which corrections to a wide range of parameters  including instrumental delays , propagation delays through the atmosphere , and source positions  are simultaneously estimated .    to avoid the often onerous task of determining the change in the number of @xmath25 phase wraps between successive scans prior to model fitting , multiband delays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are commonly used in place of fringe phases as the principal observables with the pmf technique .",
    "the use of multiband delays comes at a significant cost in statistical ( i.e. , snr - derived ) measurement accuracy relative to the use of fringe phases , but the use of only bright radio sources as well as observations over wide spectral bandwidths can reduce this cost .",
    "the pmf approach with multiband delays is used by the geodetic vlbi community in virtually all of their data analyses , including their studies to define the international celestial reference frame and track apparent motions of extragalactic sources @xcite . in general , the radio sources chosen for such studies are the brightest and most compact known .",
    "the pmf technique has several advantages over the prm technique .",
    "for example , since total measured fringe phases and rates ( rather than residual fringe phases and rates ) are processed in the analysis , one can make improvements or changes to a priori models used with multi - year data sets much more easily .",
    "furthermore , the use of data from multiple reference sources to account for spatial ( e.g. , elevation - angle - dependent ) as well as temporal phase variations is straightforward and readily implemented with existing software packages .",
    "in addition , because the pmf technique is a method of weighted - least - squares estimation of parameters that are treated as gaussian random variables , one can readily obtain a measure of the sensitivity of one estimated parameter ( such as a source declination ) to the variation in another ( such as the propagation delay through a site atmosphere ) by evaluating the covariance matrix obtained with the parameter estimates .",
    "the effects on estimated parameters of other model changes are also straightforward to evaluate , so various sensitivity studies to assess systematic errors can be readily implemented .",
    "unfortunately , the pmf technique also has its limitations and problems .",
    "unlike the prm technique , the pmf technique can make use of only those data for which fringe phases for a baseline are reliably detected in a single scan .",
    "thus the technique is only well suited for relatively bright sources .",
    "furthermore , the pmf technique offers no direct mechanism to account for source structure .",
    "one can assess fringe amplitudes and `` closure '' phases @xcite to identify the presence of significant structure , but the model corrections for structure have to be generated in a separate process .",
    "finally , when accuracy requirements dictate that the pmf technique be used with fringe phases rather than multiband delays , the integral number of @xmath25 phase wraps between neighboring scans must be determined , which can be a very labor - intensive process and sometimes is not even possible .",
    "we desired the most accurate astrometry that we could attain from our vlbi observations of . unfortunately ,",
    "neither the prm nor the pmf analysis technique adequately met our needs .    the prm technique , as implemented with aips , relied upon insufficiently accurate models for our astrometric demands , in particular for @xmath6 and also for eops and other parameters .",
    "these models were difficult to reliably correct properly within aips . also , the use of correct , consistent values for some model parameters , such as antenna coordinates and axis offsets , would have been somewhat burdensome to implement and assure over the 8.5  year span of our vlbi observations ( which are described further in   [ obs ] ) . in addition , we wanted to make full use of observations of a second reference source to model the effects of atmospheric gradients on our measured fringe phases , and we had no satisfactory software tools with this capacity available to us with the prm technique .",
    "finally our use of the prm technique made difficult a robust assessment of several possible sources of systematic error in our astrometric results , including , for example , our sensitivity to errors in our a  priori eop values or in the various components of our atmospheric model .",
    "we also could not use the pmf technique with all of our data , because during several observing sessions the radio emissions from  were too weak ( @xmath27  mjy ) for the star to be detected in any single scan . in several other sessions",
    ", the star was detected only intermittently in single scans and in those cases only on the most sensitive baselines .",
    "furthermore , our principal reference source , , which we selected because of its close proximity on the sky to  ( 0.7  angular separation ) and very high radio brightness , has a complex and evolving structure that made necessary the inclusion of structure corrections in our model .",
    "the pmf technique can not provide such corrections , so if we had relied upon the pmf technique for our astrometry , then we still would have needed to image  separately and generate structure models for it .",
    "likewise ,  had highly time - variable and sometimes complex structure ( see paper vii , @xcite , and @xcite ) , so we would have had to image this source separately , too .    our solution to overcome the drawbacks associated with each of the prm and pmf techniques was to merge the two approaches in a way that gave us the advantages and shed many of the disadvantages of both .",
    "the basic approach behind the ma technique is first to follow the approach of the pmf technique to obtain model corrections .",
    "one bases these corrections on data from only those radio sources  usually the reference sources  whose emissions are sufficiently bright that they can be reliably detected in a single scan on many baselines and hence are well suited for analysis with the pmf technique . for improved accuracy , structure corrections for these sources",
    "can be obtained separately and included in the analysis .",
    "the data from the sources  usually the target sources  that are not well suited for the pmf technique are left unweighted but used as `` placeholders '' so that model corrections corresponding to the observation times and positions of those sources are readily attainable via interpolation of the model results obtained from the data that are weighted . in effect , more accurate models for the target - source observables are obtained than with the conventional prm technique , because one has full use of the pmf - technique tools and models that are ( in general ) superior to those available with the prm technique . the corrected models from the pmf technique are then used with the prm technique , in place of the models and corrections that would have otherwise been used in a conventional implementation of the prm technique .",
    "our ma technique thus combines the superior model - correction capabilities of the pmf technique with the superior sensitivity of the prm technique .",
    "here we provide details about the way that we implemented the ma technique to analyze the  data obtained for .",
    "our observation strategy , as well as a list of the vlbi antennas we used , is provided in .",
    "we repeat some relevant points about our observations here .",
    "we had 35  sessions of vlbi observations of  between january 1997 and july 2005 .",
    "we made all of these observations over a continuum near 8.4  ghz ( @xmath28  cm ) .",
    "typically we used data from 12 to 14 vlbi antennas located around the world .",
    "most of the antennas we used are within the united states .",
    "we sequenced our observations through either three or four sources in a repeating 5.57  minute cycle .",
    "the three sources we observed in all 35  sessions were : our target source , ; our principal extragalactic reference source ,  ( b2251 + 158 ) ; and a secondary extragalactic reference source , .",
    "we added the fourth source , , to our cycle for the final 12  sessions .",
    "we treated this source as a second target source and used it to place bounds on the sizes of apparent changes in the positions of our reference sources due to structural evolution ( i.e. , changes in the brightness distributions of the reference sources ) .",
    "we also used it to test our different astrometric analysis techniques : we expected  ( unlike ) to be a stationary ( extragalactic ) object on the sky , so any estimated motions of the source would be a measure of the experimental errors inherent to our astrometric technique .",
    "figure  [ figskypos ] shows the relative positions on the sky of the four sources we observed .",
    "note that  is between , and approximately collinear with , the reference sources  and .",
    "we intentionally selected our reference sources with such alignment to obtain more accurate models for  data from the interpolation of the models fit to our reference - source data : these models account approximately for the elevation - angle dependencies of our measured fringe phases .",
    "we selected  primarily on the basis of its close proximity on the sky to  and secondarily for its approximate alignment , too , between  and .",
    "the cycle time , and the scan time on each source per cycle , were chosen with the intent that they would be : ( i ) long enough to get reliable fringe - phase measurements for both reference sources on all baselines within a single scan ; ( ii ) long enough to perhaps get reliable fringe - phase measurements of the guide star on at least the most sensitive baselines within a single scan , thereby allowing use of the pmf technique ; and ( iii ) short enough to determine ( without ambiguity ) the integral number of 2@xmath29 phase wraps between successive measurements of each of the sources .",
    "we used two reference sources rather than one primarily so that we could distinguish model errors that have elevation - angle dependence ( e.g. , atmospheric delays ) from those that do not ( e.g. , station clock behavior ) and thereby improve our overall astrometric accuracy ( see , too , * ? ? ?",
    "we also analyzed data from four sessions of vlbi observations of  made by one of us and other colleagues @xcite between december 1991 and july 1994 in support of the _ hipparcos _ mission @xcite .",
    "however , these four sets of observations had significant differences from the later 35  sessions of observations made specifically for . perhaps most significantly",
    ", these earlier observations used only four antennas per session and a single reference source , . therefore we did not include the results from these four earlier sessions in the comparisons of the astrometric techniques that we present in this paper .",
    "we obtained the amplitude and phase calibration of our data for the ma technique by following steps 15 outlined in   [ prmaps ] for the prm technique .",
    "we then used aips task fring to estimate the fringe phases , fringe rates , and group delays from the visibility ( i.e. , cross - correlation ) data output from the correlator .",
    "we obtained these estimates on a scan - by - scan basis .",
    "we also obtained these estimates one baseline at a time by specifying two antennas at a time with the antenna parameter of fring .",
    "the visibility data from which these estimates for each baseline were derived were independent , and thus we followed the common ( and greatly simplifying ) practice of treating the estimates for each baseline as independent .    to account for the non - pointlike brightness distribution ( i.e. , structure ) of our reference sources , we made images of the sources using the self - calibration ( or `` hybrid mapping '' ) scheme described by @xcite .",
    "we generated one such image for each reference source for each session of observations .",
    "we obtained structure corrections for our estimated fringe phases , fringe rates , and group delays by running aips task fring twice for each baseline : once with the self - calibrated clean map used as input calibration , and once with the source modeled as a point source ( which is the fring default ) .",
    "we took the structure corrections for the observables to be the differences between the estimates with a point - source map and with the clean map .",
    "an important consideration in the generation of the structure corrections is the choice within the clean map of the reference position that is defined to have zero structure correction ( i.e. , the effective point - source position of the source ) .",
    "initially , we used the brightness peak of the image of each reference source as the reference position , because the brightness peak was always clearly defined and easily identifiable . however , as we discuss in paper  iii ( @xcite ; see also paper  ii ) , further studies of the collection of images of our primary reference source  revealed that a different point within the source made a substantially better choice of presumed - stationary reference position .",
    "we thus adopted this point , identified as `` c1 '' in papers ii and iii , as the reference position for our  structure corrections .",
    "a set of images that show the location of `` c1 '' within the brightness distribution of  can be found in .",
    "the results from aips task fring for fringe phase , fringe rate , and group delay are estimates of residuals to the model used by the correlator .",
    "we used a customized version of aips task cl2hf to add these residual estimates to the a  priori model values from the correlator and place the resultant `` total '' observables into aips tables .",
    "we then `` exported '' these total observables from aips with aips task hf2sv .",
    "the resultant directory of files of total observables was combined with files of eops , surface meteorological data , antenna and source coordinates , and additional calibration data ( see below ) to produce databases that we used for the next stage of data reduction .",
    "we created these databases with the support of the vlbi group of the space geodesy program at nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "the theoretical observables and partial derivatives with respect to model parameters were computed with that vlbi group s calc software @xcite .",
    "we used calc version 9.13 and the jet propulsion laboratory s de200 ephemeris @xcite for all of our a  priori models .",
    "along with the observable data , we also exported from aips a collection of files of the model fringe phases and rates used by the correlator . in the final stage of our data reduction ,",
    "discussed in   [ mergfin ] below , we effectively replaced these model phases and rates with improved models that we derived from the observable data that we exported .",
    "the next step of our data reduction was to use the measured phases from the reference sources to improve the model estimates of the phases of the target source .",
    "in particular , we used the measured phases from our two main reference sources ,  and , to separate a  priori model errors that have an elevation - angle dependence ( as would be contained in @xmath6 in equation  [ phi ] ) from those that do not ( as would be contained in @xmath5 in equation  [ phi ] ) .",
    "we also used these measured phases to identify time intervals when the phases can not be well tracked by existing models .",
    "we unweighted the target - source data within these intervals , which could be as short as a single scan of target - source data .",
    "`` phase connection '' refers to the determination of the correct integral number of @xmath25 phase wraps between successive measurements of fringe phase for a particular baseline and source ( see figure  [ figphcon1 ] ) .",
    "phase connection is possible in part because of our very accurate a priori models and in part because of the very stable time reference ( hydrogen - maser frequency standard ) used at each vlbi antenna .",
    "our basic approach to phase connection was to start with the baselines and time segments of   and   data for which our a  priori models were sufficiently accurate that the number of @xmath25 phase wraps between successive fringe - phase measurements was immediately evident ( see figure  [ figphcon2 ] ) .",
    "we then used this subset of phase - connected data to estimate adjustments to the parameters of our a  priori model .",
    "the resulting improvement in our model enabled us to phase connect more data , and so the process proceeded in an iterative manner until we could no longer reliably phase connect any additional data . for observations above 10  elevation , we reliably connected , in total , 83% of the  and  phases that we evaluated in this data - reduction stage .",
    "the terms in equation  [ phi ] that can be associated with difficulties in the phase - connection process are those for which the model errors can result in relatively large ( @xmath30  radian ) residual phase fluctuations in a random pattern over successive reference - source scans , i.e. , in just a few minutes of time .",
    "our a  priori values for parameters such as site coordinates and eops were sufficiently accurate that they could not cause such rapid residual phase fluctuations .",
    "in fact , nearly all such phase fluctuations could be attributed to changes either in instrumental delays , @xmath5 , which include possible `` clock jumps '' in the frequency standards at the sites , or , most commonly , in propagation delays through the atmosphere , @xmath6 .",
    "the data that we could not reliably phase connect tended to involve sites with large wet atmospheric delays ( the st .",
    "croix vlba site was generally the most problematic for phase connection ) or be from observations just above the 10  elevation threshold .",
    "we used surface meteorological data ( barometric pressure , temperature , and humidity or dew point ) along with the equations from @xcite to obtain a priori estimates of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the mapping functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 we used the formulas provided by @xcite .",
    "our values for @xmath35 came from the united states air force s parameterized ionosphere model ( pim ; * ? ? ? * ) , which we adapted for use with vlbi observables @xcite .    in fitting our data to a model",
    ", we used a kalman - filter estimator that allowed us to model atmospheric delays at zenith and instrumental drifts as gauss - markov stochastic processes .",
    "our vlbi data do not provide sufficient information to simultaneously estimate adjustments to the separate terms in equation  [ tau_atm ] ; thus we adjusted only @xmath32 , the term we assumed to have the least accurate a  priori model .",
    "figure  [ smzenadj ] shows the adjustments to @xmath32 that we obtained with our kalman - filter estimator for the data corresponding to figures  [ figphcon1 ] and  [ figphcon2 ] .    through the use of data from two reference sources ,  and",
    ", we were able to distinguish model adjustments to @xmath36 , which has elevation - angle dependencies , from model adjustments to other terms , e.g. , @xmath37 , which do not .",
    "large phase jumps between successive reference - source scans were generally attributed to atmospheric fluctuations . since the size of atmospheric fluctuations roughly scaled with the signal path length through the atmosphere , phase connection was generally easiest when the observed sources were at high elevation angles . thus we generally started our phase - connection process with data obtained during the middle of an observing session , when the sources were at their highest elevation angles at antennas near the middle of the array .",
    "we then worked our way `` outward '' towards the early and late scans of the session .",

    "first we created files of fringe - phase and fringe - rate differences between the models derived from the reference - source data and the models ( from the correlator ) originally used in aips .",
    "then we used aips task tbin to create an aips `` solution '' ( sn ) table with these differences .",

    "we used aips task clcal to incorporate these model adjustments .",

    "we obtained positions for our target sources from these imagr maps as described in paper  vi @xcite .",
    "we used two figures of merit to compare the results of our ma technique with the more conventional prm and pmf techniques : the quality , as described below , of the  and  images produced ( ma and prm techniques only ) ; and the level of consistency of the astrometric results for each of these two sources .",

    "since the major source of phase - calibration error with the prm technique is often poor modeling of the atmosphere , and since ( as mentioned earlier ) atmospheric model errors tend to get larger at low elevation angles , the removal of low - elevation - angle data can potentially improve the quality of both the image and the astrometry obtained with the prm technique .",

    "the results found for our images are mostly consistent with this expectation , although table  [ 2252comptab ] shows that for , the higher elevation - angle cutoff did improve the @xmath38/@xmath39 ratio with the ma technique in four of the twelve sessions . in any event , even if , for the prm technique , we select for each session the elevation - angle cutoff in table  [ 2252comptab ] with the highest dynamic range or @xmath38/@xmath39 ratio for each session , the corresponding ma images for a 10  elevation - angle cutoff have , on average , 1.9  times the dynamic range and 2.7  times the @xmath38/@xmath39 ratio of the prm images . the ma images , when compared with the prm images , also show significantly less variability in peak flux density for the two different elevation - angle cutoffs that are used . this superior consistency , too , suggests that the ma technique provides more accurate model calibration than the prm technique .",
    "figure [ hr8703compfig ] shows representative images of  produced with both the prm and ma techniques .",
    "averaged across all of our observing sessions , the peak flux density we detected for  was 16% higher with the ma technique than with the prm technique .",

    "in addition , we know that  can vary in total brightness and brightness distribution ( i.e. , radio structure ) over hour time scales ( paper vii , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which further complicates comparisons between the techniques , especially since a constant flux density over the full duration of a session of observations is inherently assumed in the imaging process for both techniques .",
