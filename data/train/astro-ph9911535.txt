    "in the presence of a strong magnetic field the properties of atomic and molecular systems change substantially leading to new unexpected phenomena .",
    "it has been a long time since the predictions made by kadomtsev and kudryavtsev @xcite , and ruderman @xcite , about the possible existence of unusual chemical compounds in the presence of a strong magnetic field which are aligned along the magnetic line .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the effective quasi - one - dimensionality of coulombic systems appearing due to the enormous lorentz force acting on a system in transverse direction .",
    "the transverse size of such systems is governed by the magnetic field and is of the order of the cyclotron radius @xmath10 while the longitudinal size remains of atomic ( molecular ) order shrinking logarithmically @xmath11 ( see , for example , @xcite ) , where @xmath12 , is in @xmath13 and , in particular , it has a meaning of the energy of free electron in magnetic field . ] . as a consequence of such quasi - one - dimensionality",
    "the electron - nuclei attraction becomes more effective , yielding the possibility of compensating the coulombic repulsion of nuclei and thus to the possible existence of exotic systems that do not exist without a magnetic field .",
    "in particular , it was conjectured that the presence of a strong magnetic field can lead to the formation of linear molecules ( linear chains ) situated along magnetic lines @xcite . recently ,",
    "the first quantitative study of the possible existence of the exotic molecular ion @xmath2 or , in other words , a bound state in the system of three protons and an electron @xmath14 was carried out @xcite .",
    "it turned out that for @xmath15 the potential energy surface as a function of internuclear distances possesses a minimum , which deepens with magnetic field growth .",
    "it provides an evidence that for magnetic fields @xmath16 such molecular ion can exist @xcite . in the present article",
    "we extend this study and show that for magnetic fields @xmath17 a bound state in @xmath7 system or , in other words , another exotic molecular ion @xmath3 can exist .",
    "the aim of this article is to perform a detailed quantitative study and comparison of the one - electron systems @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in strong magnetic field .",
    "our study is limited to an exploration of the ground state only .",
    "it is assumed that the born - oppenheimer approximation holds , which implies that the positions of protons are kept fixed .",
    "we consider the linear molecular configuration for which the protons are aligned with the magnetic field ( linear configuration parallel to a magnetic line ) .",
    "this configuration looks optimal from a physical point of view .",
    "spin effects ( linear zeeman effect ) are neglected .",
    "the magnetic field ranges from 0 up to @xmath18 , where non - relativistic considerations hold ( for a detailed discussion see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in order to study the stability of the system @xmath2 ,",
    "the longitudinal vibrational modes of the nuclei are considered , while transversal modes ( deviation from linearity of the configuration as well as alignment along magnetic line ) are not taken into account .",
    "the position of the lowest longitudinal vibrational state is estimated .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that for all studied one - electron systems the binding energy @xmath19 ( affinity to keep the electron bound ) grows with the increase of the magnetic field strength for @xmath20 . for almost all accessible magnetic fields @xmath21 the molecular ion @xmath1 ( see the results in @xcite ) is the most bound one - electron system while for magnetic fields @xmath22 the molecular ion @xmath2 becomes the most bound .",
    "our calculations show as well that for magnetic fields @xmath23 the potential energy surface of the system @xmath7 exhibits the appearance of a minimum indicating the possible formation of such a molecular ion @xmath3 .",
    "it hints at a certain hierarchy of the thresholds for the appearance of new one - electron linear molecular system : @xmath2  at @xmath24 , @xmath3  at @xmath22 etc . etc .",
    "can develop a minimum . ]",
    "if this is so , it is very unlikely that the system @xmath25 can appear for magnetic fields existing on the surface of neutron stars . for larger magnetic fields a reliable study requires taking into account relativistic corrections , which is beyond of the scope of this article .",
    "so , the question about the possible existence of @xmath25 is open .",
    "the present calculations are carried out in the framework of a variational method using , for each system , a _",
    "unique _ simple trial function equally applicable to any value of the magnetic field strength . for a successful study a wise choice of trial functions is needed .",
    "a constructive criterion for an adequate choice of trial function ( see @xcite@xcite ) is the following : ( i ) the trial function @xmath26 should include all symmetry properties of the problem in hand ; ( ii ) if the ground state is studied , the trial function should not vanish inside the domain where the problem is defined ; ( iii ) the potential @xmath27 , for which the trial function is an exact eigenfunction , should reproduce the original potential behavior near singularities as well as its asymptotic behavior .",
    "let us first introduce notation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we consider identical , infinitely - heavy centers of unit charge situated on the @xmath28-axis .",

    "a class of trial functions which satisfy the above - mentioned criterion incorporating the basic physical features of coulomb systems in a magnetic field directed along the @xmath28-axis contains a function @xmath34 as a basic element , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are variational parameters , and @xmath37 is the number of centers .",
    "this function is nothing but the product of ground - state coulomb functions and the lowest landau orbital and is the exact eigenfunction of the potential @xmath38    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -2\\sum_i \\alpha_i \\frac{1}{r_i } - \\beta b   + \\sum_{i , j } \\alpha_i \\alpha_j \\ , ( { \\hat n}_i \\cdot { \\hat n}_j ) + \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\beta b \\ , \\frac { \\rho^2}{r_i } + { \\beta}^2 \\frac{b^2\\rho^2}{4}\\ , \\\\[5pt ] { \\hat n}_i \\cdot { \\hat n}_j & = & \\frac{1}{r_i r_j } \\left [ \\rho^2   + ( z - z_i)(z - z_j ) \\right ] \\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is unit vector in @xmath40th direction .",
    "this potential reproduces coulomb - like behavior near the centers and two - dimensional oscillator behavior in the @xmath41 plane at large distances ( cf .",
    "( 1 ) ) .",
    "since the centers are identical the problem possesses permutation symmetry .",
    "hence the ground state trial function must be permutationally - symmetric with respect to permutation of positions of the centers , @xmath42 .",
    "one of the simplest functions satisfying the above - mentioned criterion is the function ( [ eq:2 ] ) itself with the same @xmath43 s ( those can be placed equal to @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are variational parameters .",
    "actually , this function is a heitler - london type function multiplied by the lowest landau orbital .",
    "if the internuclear distances are taken as parameters , it has in total ( @xmath47 ) variational parameters .",
    "it is quite natural from a physical viewpoint to assume that this function gives a description of the system near the equilibrium position .",
    "the potential @xmath48 , corresponding to this function is : @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "( 3 ) ) .",
    "another possible trial function is a permutationally - symmetric linear superposition of the functions ( [ eq:2 ] ) in which all @xmath43 s are placed to be equal to zero except one , which is denoted @xmath50 @xmath51 here @xmath52 are variational parameters .",
    "this function is a hund - mulliken type function multiplied by the lowest landau orbital .",
    "one can assume that when all internuclear distances are sufficiently large this function dominates , giving an essential contribution .",
    "thus , it describes an interaction of the hydrogen atom with @xmath53 charged centers .",
    "this function can also describe a possible decay mode of the studied system to the hydrogen atom and @xmath53 protons . as in eq.([eq:4 ] ) , the trial function ( [ eq:6 ] ) is characterized by @xmath54 variational parameters .    another trial function describes a possible decay mode @xmath55 , and is a permutationally - symmetric linear superposition of the functions ( [ eq:2 ] ) with all @xmath43 s are equal to zero except two , which are taken to be equal and denoted as @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 are variational parameters .",
    "it seems that the function ( [ eq:7 ] ) gives the dominant contribution to the large internuclear distances when the distance between two neighboring centers is kept fixed .",
    "it can be true for magnetic fields @xmath59 , where the system with the lowest total energy is @xmath1 .",
    "eq.([eq:7 ] ) also depends on @xmath54 variational parameters .    finally , for magnetic fields @xmath15 where the exotic state @xmath2 begins to appear we also introduce a trial function of the form @xmath60 where again @xmath61 and @xmath62 are variational parameters .",
    "this function depends on @xmath47 variational parameters .    in order to incorporate in a single trial function the behavior of the system both near equilibrium and at large distances",
    ", we use an appropriate interpolation of the trial functions ( [ eq:4 ] ) , ( [ eq:6 ] ) , ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "there are several natural types of such interpolations :    * total non - linear superposition of the form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are variational parameters , and the sum is over all permutations of the parameters @xmath66 .",
    "the function ( [ eq:9 ] ) is an @xmath37-center modification of the guillemin - zener type function used for the description of the molecular ion @xmath67 in a magnetic field ( see eq.(2.5 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "if all parameters coincide @xmath68 , the function ( [ eq:9 ] ) reduces to the heitler - london type function ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "if the only parameter is non - zero , say @xmath69 , this function reduces to the hund - mulliken type wave function ( [ eq:6 ] ) , if two parameters are non - zero , and equal , say , @xmath70 it reduces to the trial function ( [ eq:7 ] ) , and if three parameters are non - zero , @xmath71 it reduces to ( [ eq:8 ] ) . in general , there are @xmath72 variational parameters ( including the internuclear distances as parameters ) characterizing the trial function ( [ eq:9 ] ) . *",
    "partial non - linear superpositions : + these are special cases of ( [ eq:9 ] ) when two or more parameters are equal . for instance , for @xmath73 @xmath74 : @xmath75 this function can be considered as a non - linear interpolation between eqs .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) for the @xmath2 ion . * linear superposition of eqs.([eq:4 ] ) , ( [ eq:6 ] ) , ( [ eq:7 ] ) , ( [ eq:8 ] ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 are taken as extra variational parameters .",
    "it should be mentioned that in general @xmath78 are not orthogonal and thus the parameters @xmath79 do not have a meaning of the weight factors .",
    "so , each of the above interpolations has a certain physical meaning describing different physical situations . in order to make up a rich description of the systems",
    "one can take a linear superposition of all previously mentioned functions with factors in front of them , those are treated as extra variational parameters . in this work",
    "we use only some particular cases of this general interpolation procedure ( see below for details ) .",

    "the energy of the lowest vibrational state is defined as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are determined by curvatures near minimum of the potential well along the principal axes : @xmath93 , see fig . 1 .",
    "one should emphasize that with a magnetic field growth all studied systems become more and more bounded . also for both @xmath94 and @xmath2 the energy of the lowest vibrational state increases .",
    "the vibrational state for @xmath3 was not studied .",

    "@xcite . in our study for the ground state of the @xmath0-atom",
    "we use the trial function of the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) at @xmath95 ( see @xcite@xcite ) @xmath96 where @xmath43 and @xmath97 are variational parameters . a comparison with the results obtained by lai et al .",
    "@xcite shows that this simple trial function gives a relative accuracy @xmath98 in energy for magnetic fields @xmath20 .",
    "the binding energy for this system increases with magnetic field growth and the longitudinal size reduces drastically from @xmath99 at @xmath100 to @xmath101 at @xmath102 . the total energy for the @xmath0-atom is larger than the total energy for @xmath1 for all studied magnetic fields , as well as larger than the total energies for @xmath2 and for @xmath3 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively ( see table i ) .",
