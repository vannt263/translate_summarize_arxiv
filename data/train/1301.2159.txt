    "we will address the few - body structures that can be expected in an array of several tubes . a schematic setup for three tubes",

    "the orientation of the dipolar molecules in the tubes can be controlled by an external electric or magnetic field depending on whether magnetic atoms or heteronuclear molecules are used .",

    "we are concerned with the important question of existence of @xmath0-body bound states in multi - tube geometries . in order to address this",

    "this is particularly important for many - body studies since zero - range interactions are not only convenient to work with but also often allow analytical results to be obtained .",

    "- dimensional tubes are constructed by applying optical lattices to the dipolar gas @xcite . in this case",
    "the tubes are not strictly one - dimensional but will have some width along the transverse direction that is determined by the laser intensity .",
    "this can be translated into a gaussian wave packet in the transverse direction that will be increasingly localized in space as the laser intensity increases .",
    "an effective interaction that takes this into account by integrating out a gaussian wave packet can then be obtained @xcite , which will in the limit of zero gaussian width reduce to the expression in ( [ int ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the lattice is very strong so that the strict one - dimensional expression above is valid for the interaction of particles in different tubes which is accurate when the transverse width , @xmath6 , is much smaller than the intertube distance , @xmath2 .",
    "corrections to this picture have been discussed in references @xcite and @xcite . below we will return to the question of finite transverse width when we treat bound states with more than one particle per tube . from here on we will adopt units @xmath19 and @xmath2 for all energies and lengths .",

    "below we will mostly address the situation where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , i.e. dipoles that are oriented perpendicular to the tubes . in this case , the integral in ( [ intpot ] ) is @xmath25 and this means that the system can produce bound dimers between any two particles that are located in different tubes for any @xmath26 .",
    "however , if a given few - body state has more than one particle in a single tube , then the interlayer interaction will be either attractive or repulsive depending on the sign of @xmath27 ( see ( [ int ] ) with @xmath18 ) . here",
    "we will only consider the regime where this quantity is positive , i.e. the case for which two dipoles in a single tube repel each other in order to avoid any collapsing states within the tubes .",
    "we now present our results for up to five dipolar bosonic particles in multi - tube geometries .",
    "the discussion will involve analytical tools for addressing the limits of weak and strong dipolar interactions which will be compared to numerics using the exact stochastic variational approach @xcite .",
    "this allows us to determine the range of validity of the analytical methods that we employ .",
    "along the way we will make a detailed comparison between the one - dimensional case with tubes and the two - dimensional case of multiple layers @xcite .",
    "we will also compare to the results of mcguire @xcite for the exact ground state energy of an @xmath0-boson system with pairwise zero - range interactions in one dimension .",
    "finally , we will investigate few - body states with more than one particle in a single tube for both the case of perpendicular dipoles ( @xmath24 and @xmath23 ) and with tilted angles ( @xmath24 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the first case is one dipolar particle in each of two adjacent tubes with dipole moments oriented perpendicular to the tubes ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "this configuration has the schrdinger equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relative distance of the two dipoles along the tube axis , @xmath31 is the eigenenergy in units of @xmath19 and @xmath32 is the wave function .",
    "we start with the analytically accesible limits of strong @xmath33 and weak @xmath34 binding .    _ weak binding . _ from reference @xcite we know that a bound state exists for potentials that fulfil @xmath35 . for this bound state",

    "the term @xmath40 appears to diverge , but the second term will also contribute and the combination yields the correct answer .",
    "we now obtain the equation for the binding energy @xmath41 for weak binding this can be solved iteratively for small @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 here we have used that @xmath44 . upon inserting the potential in ( [ int ] ) with @xmath15 and carrying out the integrals we find @xmath45 which implies that to leading order in @xmath22 , @xmath46 .",
    "these results were initially discussed by landau @xcite and simon @xcite but the procedure we present here allows simpler access to the higher - order terms .",
    "we note that the first term in ( [ weak ] ) corresponds to a delta - function potential @xmath47 with @xmath48 ( where we have reintroduced explicit units for clarity ) .",
    "numerically we find that this potential gives good approximation for the real potential with @xmath49 .",
    "this is a valuable conclusion for studies that depend on a delta - function representation of the dipolar interaction in one dimension in order to describe many - body physics @xcite .    a clear difference to the 2d case",
    "is seen at this point .",
    "the weak - binding result in 1d is @xmath50 , whereas in 2d it is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that weakly - bound 1d dipolar few - body bound states are generally more stable than similar systems in 2d , and any sort of external perturbations would have a less severe effect in the 1d setup .",
    "we can also consider the case where @xmath52 corresponding to one of the dipoles in the two tubes pointing in opposite directions which should be possible to achieve using ac fields @xcite . in this case",
    "the 2d setup with two adjacent planes will _",
    "always _ have a bound dimer @xcite , whereas in 1d we find numerically that it takes a finite strength @xmath53 to bind the two - body system .",
    "we can understand the latter if we consider @xmath54 in ( [ bind - en ] ) .",
    "this transforms the condition for the appearance of the bound state . for small @xmath22 we have @xmath55 , which has two solutions ; one corresponds to bound states with @xmath56 and another for bound states with @xmath57 .",
    "the latter is within 2 percent of the numerical value .",
    "however , notice that the @xmath52 case opens up the possibility of binding and unbinding the dimer by tuning @xmath22 as originally envisioned in reference @xcite .",
    "_ strong binding 1d _ for this case we may assume that our wave function is strongly localised near the origin , i.e. @xmath58 , such that the probability to be in the classically forbidden region is small . under these conditions",
    "we can use standard techniques to obtain the binding energy and the wave function .",
    "first we decompose the potential near the origin @xmath59 using the assumption of strong localization we see that up to terms @xmath60 we can solve the harmonic oscillator problem for the first two terms and include the third term via perturbation theory .",
    "this yields @xmath61 a comparison of the numerical results for all values of @xmath22 to the weak and strong binding expansions is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "both the limit of weak and strong binding are well reproduced by the different approximation schemes .",
    "we see differences between numerical and analytical results only around @xmath62 . for completeness",
    "we also summarize all the analytical results and their regimes of validity in table  [ tab ]    .comparison between 1d and 2d binding energies of two dipoles in two different layers or tubes with perpendicularly oriented dipole moments .",
    "the regimes of validity of the different analytical formulae are indicated in the parenthesis . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now proceed to discuss the case where we have @xmath0-body chains that consist of one dipolar particle in each of @xmath0 adjacent layers or tubes . in the 2d case ,",
    "these sorts of structures have generated a lot of recent interest since one expects highly non - trivial few- and many - body dynamics @xcite .",
    "there is a similar interest in the one - dimensional multi - tube configurations @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath0-body 1d system is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the relative distance of the @xmath65th and @xmath66th particles along the tube direction and @xmath67 is the integer that signifies how far apart the tubes are that hold the @xmath65th and @xmath66th particles ( @xmath15 for adjacent tubes and so on ) . for the case where the pair - wise potentials of equal strength and zero - range , this hamiltonian was studied in the classical papers of lieb and liniger @xcite",
    "mcguire has shown that for this delta - function case , the bound state energy , @xmath68 , of the @xmath0-body problem can be written very elegantly as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the two - body bound state energy of the same delta - function potential @xcite .    here",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 dipoles placed in @xmath0 different tubes with the potential in ( [ hamil ] ) given by ( [ int ] ) .",
    "this is intrinsically a case with long - range interactions which has also generated some classical studies . in the particular case where the interaction behaves as @xmath71",
    "this is the sutherland - calogero model @xcite . in the present case with dipoles",
    "we have a long - range tail that behaves as @xmath72 .",
    "we would like to build a connection to the zero - range studies for the dipolar systems in 1d .",
    "for general polarization angles , however , the interactions are anisotropic and more difficult to compare to the isotropic zero - range models . in this section",
    "we therefore study the case of perpendicular polarization ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) where the anisotropy is absent .",
    "as we have demonstrated above , for @xmath49 we get universal behaviour in a sense that the potential @xmath73 accurately describes our system .",
    "now we want to establish how well this zero - range approximation works on the few - body level with @xmath74 .",
    "to do so we first consider a toy model where all @xmath0 particles interact with the same interaction corresponding to @xmath15 in ( [ int ] ) .",
    "this is precisely the case where it makes sense to compare to the analytical result @xmath69 . in this way",
    "we can get a feeling for when the zero - range approximation works .",
    "for realistic chains @xmath13 is not always equal to one .",
    "this means that these are easier to describe using a zero - range approximation since particle pairs that are located several tubes apart in a chain have a potential that effectively correspond to a smaller value of @xmath22 ( as compared to the @xmath15 case ) .",
    "the numerically calculated chain binding energies relative to the two - body energy , @xmath75 , for both the toy model and the real dipolar chains in 1d are presented in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "we observe the delta - function behaviour in all cases for @xmath76 , and the strong coupling behavior is slowly approached with increasing interaction strength . in current experiments with @xmath77k-@xmath78rb molecules",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath79 so this is weak - coupling in the current context . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the leading term for the toy model is @xmath80 which is simply the number of pairs that all contribute an energy @xmath70 . for the realistic chain ,",
    "the expression is instead @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the harmonic number of order @xmath83 .",
    "we will elaborate more on the strong - coupling limit below .",
    "we see a large difference between the toy model and the real chain in figure  [ figure2 ] in the weak - coupling limit @xmath84 .",
    "this is an important conclusion of our work that has implications for many - body studies on dipolar systems that work with delta - function approximations for the dipolar interactions .",
    "the toy model is relevant for an equidistant triangular tube configuration as studied in reference  @xcite .",
    "our results for this @xmath85 case show a very flat profile for all values of @xmath22 and from the point of view of energetics it is thus a reasonable approximation to use the delta - function @xmath86",
    ". the @xmath87 and @xmath88 would be applicable to a tube configuration with four and five nearest - neighbours respectively ( the latter would of course not be possible with standard crystal lattices ) .",
    "however , in these cases the variation of the energies with @xmath22 is much more drastic , indicating that a zero - range description is only good for very small @xmath22 .",
    "for the real chain systems , the curves are rather flat for all @xmath0 .",
    "this is connected to the fact that the terms with @xmath89 in ( [ hamil ] ) will give a contribution that is suppressed .",
    "due to the flatness of the curves in figure  [ figure2 ] , we can get a good approximation for the @xmath0-body binding energy of the realistic chains by using an effective model for @xmath0-body systems with @xmath90 where @xmath91u .",
    "\\label{ueff}\\ ] ] the blessing of working with a zero - range interaction comes at the price of having an @xmath0-dependent coupling .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath0-body bound states present in this geometry are properly described .",
    "we will use this effective dipolar strength to study the corresponding many - body system below .",
    "we stress that the delta - function approximation with @xmath92 coupling is only accurate for weak interaction , i.e. small @xmath22 . in the case of @xmath93 from @xmath94 and up to @xmath95 we find a difference of about @xmath96 on the value while for @xmath85 and @xmath87 the difference is slightly less .",
    "so the flatness and thus the reliability of the delta - function approach is on the level of @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is very important to notice that we reproduce the strong - coupling limit , i.e. large @xmath22 , with this choice of @xmath99 .",
    "this means that if we use the potential in ( [ ueff ] ) as an effective potential between @xmath0 bosonic particles in one dimension , we obtain the correct strong - coupling binding energy ( [ strong ] ) .",
    "this all builds on the flatness of the energy in figure  [ figure2 ] and is only as good as the uncertainty quoted above .",
    "this is important to notice as below we will look at low - energy many - body physics using this effective interaction .",
    "_ chains in the oscillator approximation _ as we have seen for small @xmath22 , the zero - range approximation gives reliable results .",
    "however , we would also like to discuss the strong binding limit where @xmath100 and provide a simple analytical procedure for obtaining the energies and wave functions .",
    "this can be done using exact harmonic models @xcite where the full two - body interaction ( the dipolar interaction in this case ) is represented by a harmonic oscillator with parameters that are carefully chosen to reproduce energetics and structure at the two - body level @xcite .",
    "we expect this to be a good approximation for @xmath100 since the potential in ( [ int ] ) has a deep pocket in this case . however , it turns out that this approximation can be very accurate even for moderate @xmath22 in the case of 2d multi - layered systems with chains @xcite .    in figure  [ figure3 ]",
    "we show a comparison of the oscillator approximation to exact numerical calculations for the case of perpendicularly oriented dipoles ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "note that the horizontal axis begins at @xmath101 ( for @xmath102 the oscillator does not reproduce the exact results well ) .",
    "we get a very good agreement for @xmath85 , while for higher particle numbers there is a clearly visible deviation .",
    "this stems from issues with the two - body interactions coming from the outermost tubes where the oscillator approximation starts to fail since the contributions are not well - described by an oscillator ( the effective @xmath22 for these terms is small for any @xmath22 value considered here ) . however , the overall agreement is still within a few percent for @xmath103 .",
    "one way to improve the agreement for higher particle numbers could be to introduce an effective three - body force ( more generally an @xmath0-body force ) in addition to the two - body potential terms .",
    "such an approach is very common in nuclear physics and in effective field theory studies of universal three - body physics @xcite .",
    "we now change the angle @xmath4 to investigate the effects of anisotropy .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] shows the case with @xmath104 and @xmath24 , where @xmath105 satisfies @xmath106 .",
    "recalling the discussion after ( [ int ] ) this implies that the potential between two dipoles in the same tube vanishes .",
    "first we observe that the overall energy scale becomes smaller , because the depth of the potential and net volume of the potential is smaller than for the perpendicular polarization case in figure  [ figure3 ] . for @xmath85 and @xmath87 we again see very good agreement between the oscillator approximation and the numerics .",
    "the largest chain with @xmath93 shows what appears to be an even better agreement than for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 case .",
    "what is also striking is that the oscillator results and the numerics cross around @xmath107 .",
    "this happens since our method ensures that the oscillator reproduces the slope of the numerical results in the limit @xmath100 ( as discussed for the 2d case in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the optimization of the parameters for the two - body oscillator potential for @xmath108 , however , produces a slightly different slope and a crossing thus takes place .",
    "we now consider the case where there are two particles in one tube .",
    "the simplest configuration of this sort is two tubes with three particles in total , i.e. one particle in one tube and two particles in the adjacent tube . at this point",
    "we need to take the width of the tube that we discussed in section  [ setup ] explicitly into account in order to work with an intratube interaction that best describes the experimental situation .",
    "this can be done by folding the potential with a gaussian wave packet of width @xmath6 that represents the wave function of the system in the transverse direction ( along the @xmath109-axis in figure  [ schematic ] ) this yields the intratube interaction @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the strength of the intratube interaction .",
    "this means that the intratube potential has been regularized by the finite width of the transverse confinement and does not have the strict 1d form @xmath114 _ expect _ in the limit of @xmath115 . in a system where the dipole moment is the same for all particles in all tubes we have @xmath116 , where @xmath22 is the strength of the intertube interaction .",
    "the dipole orientation and the induced dipole moment is typically controlled by applying an external electric or magnetic field that is constant across the whole system . however ,",
    "if one applies also a field gradient then it should be possible to obtain a system where the induced dipoles moment varies from tube to tube ( or layer to layer in the 2d multilayer case ) . in this case",
    "we can have a situation where @xmath117 and we thus vary both quantities independently in the current study . as discussed previously , we will consider only the repulsive case where @xmath118 in order to avoid possible intratube collapse of the system . unless explicitly states , we use @xmath119 everywhere ( see reference @xcite for a discussion of the effects of changing @xmath120 ) .",
    "we start by considering the case where all particles are perpendicularly polarized , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "observe that if @xmath121 we have a trimer energy that is below the dimer energy , and if @xmath122 we can not bind three particles .",
    "we now want to find the value @xmath123 at which the three - body system is bound for a given value of @xmath22 , so we keep @xmath22 fixed and vary @xmath113 . in reference",
    "@xcite it has been shown that @xmath124 is an increasing function of @xmath22 by an argument that does not depend on the dimensionality and thus applies equally well to layers in 2d and tubes in 1d . in turn",
    "we only need to consider @xmath125 to obtain an upper bound for @xmath124 .",
    "this upper bound is a decreasing function of @xmath120 and for @xmath119 we get @xmath126 . in order to find the lower bound for @xmath124 we will use the variational principle with a normalised three - body wave function of the form @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the normalised dimer wave function and we have used jacobi coordinates @xmath129 and @xmath130 . from this",
    "we obtain the upper bound for the three - body energy @xmath131\\mathrm{d}x\\bigg)|\\varphi\\rangle,&\\label{e3var}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kinetic term for the @xmath109 coordinate is @xmath132 . here",

    "equation ( [ bind - en ] ) in principle allows us to estimate where @xmath135 holds , which gives us the lower bound for @xmath123 .",
    "however , in general this equation is not easy to analyse so we obtain the lower bound using the simpler condition for the effective potential acting on @xmath136 in ( [ e3var ] ) which is that it must have negative net volume .",

    "collecting our results , we have for @xmath119 that @xmath140 .",
    "this means that if we could manipulate the values of the intratube and intertube interactions independently , we could create or destroy the three - body bound state in two tubes with perpendicular polarization .",
    "this effect is completely due to the finite range of the potential , because for zero - range potentials any value @xmath141 will produce a bound state ( the system becomes equivalent to the fermionic states studied by mcquire in reference  @xcite for which a bound state always exists ) .    in figure  [ figure5 ]",
    "we show the critical value , @xmath124 , as a function of @xmath22 for both the case of 1d tubes and for comparison we also plot the results of the same study for a bilayer in 2d @xcite .",
    "both of these calculations have been done with @xmath119 .",
    "we see a clear difference between the critical values for three - body bound state formation in the two cases with the 1d situation allowing for larger repulsive interactions .",
    "this is connected to the price one pays for localizing particles in a bound states complex . in 2d",
    "we need to localize in two independent directions which is more expensive than 1d . as expected , 1d tubes are more favourable for formation of these larger complexes .    having discussed how a tuning of the intratube repulsion can bind a three - body state , we now consider an alternative route to bind this state which is by tilting the angle , @xmath4 .",

    ", we find the result @xmath147 .",
    "the function @xmath148 is decreasing with @xmath120 which is a result of the behaviour of the function in ( [ fold ] ) which has a finite value for zero argument for any finite @xmath120 . in strict 1d",
    "we expect that the repulsion will not allow this three - body bound state due to the cubic singularity @xmath114 of the repulsive potential . for the more realistic case with a finite @xmath120 we can have bound states for angle in the regime @xmath149 as well .",
    "an additional bound can be found by using classical arguments , i.e. neglecting kinetic energy in the schrdinger equation and studying just the potential landscape @xcite .",
    "this yields a bound of @xmath150 or @xmath151 so that for any @xmath22 we do not have three - body bound states in the case where @xmath116 . in summary , we have found that for @xmath152 there exist a value of @xmath153 , such that for @xmath154 the bi - tube trimer is bound .    in figure  [ figure6 ]",
    "we plot @xmath155 as a function of @xmath4 for three particles in two tubes in the case where @xmath116 , i.e. the case of current experimental interest where the dipole strength is controlled by one external field that is constant over the entire samples .",
    "the points indicate the values at which the dissociation points have been obtained numerically ( connecting lines are a guide to the eye ) .",
    "the three - body bound states are present on the left - hand side in the diagram since here the intratube repulsion is not strong enough to break the bound state apart .",
    "the results obtained here are consistent with results reference  @xcite for @xmath156 where a comparison can be made . for @xmath157",
    "we find a very sharp increase in @xmath142 that takes place at @xmath158 , a few degrees before a classical calculation renders the system unbound at @xmath159 .    in order to address the question of additional tubes and their effect on bound states with more than one particle per tube ,",
    "we have also consider a four - body state in three tubes ( as in figure  [ schematic ] ) with two dipoles in the middle tube and one in each of the two outer tubes .",
    "the results are also presented in figure  [ figure6 ] .",
    "we again see a sharp increase for large @xmath4 before we get to the classically unbound value of @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "however , there is a significant increase of region in which bound state with two particles in a single tube are present due to the extra attraction from adding a particle in an adjacent tube on the other side of the complex as compared to the three - body system with two and one in two tubes .",
    "other four - body states can occur in two tubes as discussed in reference  @xcite , but the parameter regime is severely suppressed due to the extra repulsion in the three - plus - one and two - plus - two four - body states in two tubes .",
    "we therefore expect that the case of three tubes could have interesting quasi-wigner crystal states for large @xmath22 beyond the clustered states studied in reference  @xcite where the clusters are not of the same size in each tube ( here with cluster size one in the outer tubes and two in the inner tube ) .",
    "we can continue this kind of game for five tubes in a one - two - one - two - one configuration and so on .",
    "while we are mainly concerned with negative energy bound state structures in this paper , we now present a short overview of some scattering results that can be deduced directly based on the formalism we introduced above .",
    "one basically only needs to make an analytical continuation of the bound state discussions above in order to arrive at results for scattering of dipolar bosons in 1d tubes . since current experiments with cold molecules",
    "aim for the low temperature regime where quantum degeneracy can be reached , we will focus exclusively on the low - energy scattering regime here .",
    "the formal solution of the scattering problem , @xmath162 , satisfies the equation @xmath163)}{k}v(y)\\psi(k , y),\\ ] ] where the boundary condition is an out - going flux to the right with coefficient one of the form @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "here we define the reflection , @xmath165 , and transmission , @xmath166 , coefficients through @xmath167 to be consistent with standard 1d potential scattering . by taking the limit @xmath168",
    "we obtain @xmath169 for @xmath170 , poles of @xmath166 define bound states with the binding energy defined through the equation @xmath171 which is consistent with ( [ bind - en ] ) and allows us to use the same techniques as before to obtain iterative improvements of the solution .",
    "consider now the case of dipoles oriented perpendicular to the layers , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the limit of weak",
    "binding and low - energy scattering , @xmath84 and @xmath172 , we find for the transmission coefficient of two particles in the two different tubes @xmath173 and for the case of two particles in the same tube we find @xmath174 these results are deceptively simple , yet they contain all the information about the dipolar physics in one - dimensional tubes at low energy in the small @xmath22 limit . as expected they vanish with @xmath83 as @xmath175 which is a manifestation of the wigner threshold law .",
    "also , as @xmath176 in the weak - coupling limit ( see table  [ tab ] ) , we see that both expressions become large at very small @xmath22 .",
    "this makes sense since the potential becomes very weak ( and likewise the derivative of the potential ) .",
    "we also see that in the strict 1d limit , @xmath115 , the transmission is completely suppressed and total reflect is expected .",
    "this is the emergence of the impenetrable boson regime called the tonks - girardeau limit @xcite .",
    "this limit can be studied with dipolar bosons in a 1d setup with an ( in - tube ) harmonic trap as discussed in reference  @xcite .",
    "since we would like to obtain an effective model for dipolar systems of @xmath0-chains using zero - range interactions , we need to relate the transmissison coeffecients above to its zero - range equivalent .",
    "if we write the potential as @xmath177 , we find @xmath178 for low - energy scattering .",
    "we see that we recover the @xmath179 result for the case of two dipoles in different tubes ( using our units of energy and length given in section  [ setup ] ) and we find @xmath180 for dipoles in the same tube .",
    "we now want to address the case of a many - body system of @xmath0 adjacent tubes with @xmath181 particles in each tube . we will focus on the case of perpendicular orientation of the dipoles with respect to the tubes ( @xmath24 and @xmath23 ) and comment on the case of general angles in the end . in the perpendicular case , we expect no bound complexes beyond the chain structures that are bound states of @xmath0 bosons with one in each of @xmath0 adjacent tubes .",
    "recent monte carlo studies of the many - body system indicate that the longest chains possible , the @xmath0-chain for @xmath0 tubes , are the relevant degrees of freedom in these systems @xcite and we therefore focus our attention on these chains .    the results that we have presented thus far show that one can make an effective model of chains using zero - range interactions with suitably adjusted coupling strength as in ( [ ueff ] ) which reproduces the chain energy in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "this is extremely useful for many - body physics since a number of 1d @xmath0-body models with zero - range interactions are exactly solvable as discussed above . for the case of bosons with attractive zero - range interactions",
    "one in fact finds a gas - like state similar to the tonks - girardeau gas of repulsively interacting bosons , denoted the super - tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . for both attractive and repulsive zero - range interactions these systems are also possible to describe using bosonic luttinger liquids ( see reference  @xcite for a recent review of 1d bosonic systems ) .",
    "these studies have been boosted by recent experimental success in realizing these 1d quantum gas @xcite . for dipolar bosons this luttinger liquid behavior",
    "was studied by several authors @xcite .    here",
    "we want to address the many - body behaviour by using the few - body physics information that we have derived above . for @xmath0 adjacent tubes with @xmath181 particles in each",
    ", we can build a system of @xmath181 chains , and then we may study the effective inter - chain interactions .",
    "using a zero - range interaction model allows us to map the problem into the realm of exactly solvable 1d systems and/or luttinger liquid studies and thus infer the many - body dynamics . here",
    "we will consider the low - energy physics only , i.e. @xmath172 .",
    "this is important for our use of ( [ trep ] ) for the intratube repulsion that we will return to below .",
    "the effective zero - range coupling in ( [ ueff ] ) has the property that it ( approximately ) reproduces the @xmath0-body binding energy of a single chain for large @xmath22 as discussed after ( [ ueff ] ) .",
    "however , if one considers two chains then one realizes that this effective interaction also describes the attractive force between two different chains .",
    "this follows readily from the fact that the intertube interactions that are responsible for the chain - chain interactions are the same as those that provide the intertube attraction in a single chain .",
    "if we ignore for a moment any intratube repulsion , we can estimate the ground state energy of a system with @xmath181 chains of length @xmath0 to be simply @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the two - body energy _ between _",
    "two _ different _ @xmath0-chains ( consider as effective degrees of freedom in the system ) calculated using the potential @xmath184 .",
    "the first term is obtained by mapping to the result obtained by mcguire @xcite for @xmath181 bosonic chains ( valid for any @xmath99 and thus any @xmath22 ) and the second term comes from the internal energy of each of the @xmath181 chains of length @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence is given implicitly through @xmath99 .",
    "the repulsive intratube interaction has thus far been ignored .",
    "we would now like to include it in a simple way through the use of ( [ trep ] ) .",
    "this was derived under the assumptions @xmath84 and @xmath172 .",
    "the latter is not a problem , while at first glance @xmath84 is not consistent with the fact that we treat the attractive interactions of the chains in a large @xmath22 limit .",
    "however , we notice that ( [ trep ] ) has the correct qualitative behaviour when @xmath22 increases ; the repulsive potential suppresses transmission as @xmath185 .",
    "we thus assume that we can still use the expression in ( [ trep ] ) and thus also a delta - function potential with @xmath180 .",
    "this is effectively a weak - coupling expression and thus our uncertainty lies in pushing the attractive part , ( [ ueff ] ) , to the weak - coupling limit .",
    "this has a @xmath96 uncertainty for @xmath186 for @xmath98 as noted below ( [ ueff ] ) .",
    "so if we stick to systems with @xmath98 the argument we have here is only expected to hold to within that uncertainty .    assuming that we can push the attractive part to weak - coupling and thus use a delta - function for both attraction and repulsion , it is not difficult to take into account through a zero - range interaction term of the form @xmath187 .",
    "the factor of @xmath0 is obtained by noting that there will be one repulsive contribution from each tube seperately . in our effective model of chains",
    ", we thus have a competition between two interactions of opposite sign , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "we can use this to esimate when the system of chains constitute an attractive or a repulsive bose gas by determining when @xmath190 .",
    "since both are proportional to @xmath22 , this will give a purely geometric condition .",
    "if we use effective delta - function interactions between chains of length @xmath0 and define @xmath191-n\\lambda^2,\\ ] ] then @xmath190 corresponds to @xmath192 , while @xmath193 gives an attractive and @xmath194 a repulsive chain system .",
    "note that this is not dependent on the number of chains , @xmath181 , since we are considering the balance of attraction and repulsion by looking at the effective delta - function two - body interactions between two chains that one would put in the @xmath181-body hamiltonian for @xmath181 chains as the two - body interaction term .",
    "what is important is then the sign of the effective two - body term which is determined by ( [ func ] ) and depends only on the chain length @xmath0 .",
    "we thus see immediately that except for very small @xmath120 , the system will be in the repulsive regime for any @xmath195 .",
    "small @xmath120 corresponds to a soft transverse confinement that requires careful treatment beyond our quasi-1d formalism .",
    "we therefore conclude that the system of dipolar chains in the intermediate to strong - coupling limit ( @xmath186 ) with dipoles oriented perpendicular to the tubes should behave as a repulsive tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "the effective parameters introduced here can be used to estimate ground state properties using the lieb - liniger model @xcite and/or luttinger liquid formalism can be used to obtain correlation functions etc",
    ".    however , we caution that we mix the limits of strong and weak coupling and that carries the uncertainty discussed above . a means of improving",
    "this is to carry out the derivation of ( [ trep ] ) to higher order .",
    "that would generate a different function of @xmath22 that could then be inserted in ( [ func ] ) .",
    "the crucial point is that going to higher order in ( [ trep ] ) would give a function with higher powers of @xmath22 in the denominator of ( [ trep ] ) .",
    "consequently , the second term in ( [ func ] ) would have a factor @xmath22 if we go to second order in ( [ trep ] ) .",
    "since it corresponds to a repulsion it will also not change the sign of the second term in ( [ func ] ) . since the first term in ( [ func ] ) does not carry factors of @xmath22 , this means that at higher order the repulsive part will be even stronger and we expect this to lead to the same conclusion ; @xmath196 and effectively a repulsive system of chains for larger values of @xmath22 where the chains are well bound and thus well - defined .",
    "if we tilt the dipolar orientation away from perpendicular , we expect a smaller effective coupling due to the angular factor in ( [ int ] ) .",
    "the repulsive part will , however , remain dominant and we expect the same conclusion as above to hold for small tilting .",
    "if we go to the value @xmath105 and @xmath24 where the intratube repulsion is zero , we naturally get an attractively interacting system .",
    "however , here we need to worry about more complicated complexes than bound states of chains as we have discussed above ( this was first pointed out in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "one could imagine that if we take a long chain ( large @xmath0 ) , then it may be possible to attract one more particle to bind to this chain around the middle tube .",
    "this may open the possibility for scattering events between chains where this extra particle is exchanged , akin to transfer reactions known for instance from nuclear physics .",
    "the nature of potentially more complicated bound structures constitute an interesting direction for future work .",
    "we have studied dipolar bosonic particles confined to a setup consisting of a number of one - dimensional tubes . for the case of equidistant adjacent tubes , we calculated the few - body bound state structures for up to five particles using both analytical and numerical tools in the weak and strong binding limits . for the case of perpendicularly oriented dipoles",
    ", we find that chain with one particle in each of a number of adjacent tubes are the most stable structures , and that more complicated bound structures with multiple particles in a single tube are unlikely unless one tilts the dipole orientation away from the perpendicular direction .",
    "the bound states in our study should be directly observable using experimental techniques such as lattice shaking @xcite , rf spectroscopy @xcite or _ in - situ _ optical detection @xcite .",
    "our results for the weak - coupling limit can be used to calculate the low - energy scattering properties of the system and make an effective zero - range model for bound chains of dipolar bosons that takes both attractive and repulsive terms into account .",
    "this allows us to use our knowledge of the few - body physics to address the many - body physics of these systems which can be mapped onto exactly solvable model in 1d and luttinger liquid dynamics .",
    "estimation of the magnitudes of the competing attractive and repulsive terms in a system of chains indicate that for perpendicular orientation the repulsion is always dominant and a tonks - girardeau type of system should emerge .",
    "this could be changed by tilting the angle of the dipoles with respect to the tubes which changes the balance between repulsive intratube and attractive intertube terms .",
    "however , the potential presence of bound state complexes with two or more particles per tube need to be considered in this case .",
    "the latter will be the focus of future investigations .    in the limit of strong binding we demonstrated that models based on replacing the true dipolar potential by a harmonic interaction are quite accurate for describing the energetics .",
    "this yields exactly solvable @xmath0-body models that could for instance be used to study thermodynamic properties in 1d dipolar systems @xcite .",
    "another intriguing possiblity is to study system where one or more of the tubes have perpendicular dipoles that point in the opposite direction .",
    "these flips can be obtained by using ac fields @xcite . for two dipoles in two adjacent tubes with opposite orientation of the dipoles we proved here that in the limit of weak dipole moment , there will be no bound two - body state .",
    "however , this does no in general rule out the possibility of a bound three - body state , a so - called borromean state @xcite .",
    "we could thus imagine a regime where three - body states are the lowest non - trivial bound states and thus give rise to an effective gas of trimers .",
    "while all of the questions addressed in this paper have been concerned with bosonic dipolar particles , we expect that similar bound state structures should arise when using fermionic dipoles .",
    "the fermionic case should correspond closely to studies on one - dimensional multi - component systems @xcite if one maps the component index onto tube index .",
