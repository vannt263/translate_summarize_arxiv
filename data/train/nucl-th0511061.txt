    "the application of chiral perturbation theory to the su(3 ) flavor sector of qcd is hampered by poor convergence properties for processes involving baryons @xcite .",
    "the original computation of the nucleon self energy by gasser , sainio and svarc @xcite was performed as an application of the manifestly covariant chiral lagrangian .",
    "it was observed that the @xmath0 scheme @xcite leads to results that contradict the power counting rules .",
    "subsequently the heavy - baryon formulation of the chiral lagrangian was suggested by jenkins and manohar @xcite .",
    "whereas the chiral power counting rules are realized transparently , manifest lorentz invariance is given up in that scheme .",
    "computations for the baryon octet masses @xcite do not appear to be convergent in the heavy - baryon formulation once the strange quark sector is included .",
    "the convergence was improved by introducing a finite cutoff into the loop functions @xcite .",
    "clearly , alternative schemes are desirable .",
    "this work aims at introducing a partial summation scheme , the construction of which is guided by covariance and analyticity .",
    "various manifestly lorentz invariant formulations of chiral perturbation theory were suggested that recover the power counting rules @xcite .",
    "all such schemes are bound to reproduce computations performed within the heavy - baryon formalism .",
    "the motivation for the search for alternatives stems in part from the quest of summation schemes that enjoy improved convergence properties .",
    "some of the proposed schemes have been applied to the evaluation of the baryon octet masses at the one - loop order .",
    "the infrared scheme ( ir ) introduced by becher and leutwyler @xcite was used by ellis and torikoshi @xcite , however , finding no convincing convergence properties . similarly the extended on - mass shell scheme ( eoms ) introduced by gegelia and japaridze @xcite suffers from unacceptably large subleading order terms @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to perform computations based on the scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will evaluate the baryon octet and decuplet self energies at the one - loop level and study the convergence properties of the minimal chiral subtraction scheme ( @xmath1-ms ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on the passarino - veltman reduction @xcite supplemented by a minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "it suggests a natural partial summation of the chiral expansion .",
    "it is proven in the appendix of the present work that given any one - loop integral that arises when computing one - baryon processes it is sufficient to renormalize the scalar master - loop functions of the passarino - veltman reduction in a manner that the latter are compatible with the expectation of chiral counting rules . within the @xmath1-ms scheme the empirical octet and decuplet masses",

    "it may be taylor expanded in the 4-momenta @xmath73 around the point @xmath74 .",
    "the assumption @xmath75 implies that the integrals are real , which guarantees that the expansion converges in the kinematical domain studied .",
    "any coefficient can be expressed in terms of the objects @xmath76 .",
    "thus , if the renormalization is to commute with the passarino - veltman reduction and also with the taylor expansion around @xmath74 we must insist on @xmath77 owing to the passarino - veltman reduction it follows @xmath78 which is compatible with the minimal expected dimensional power @xmath79 .",
