    "in our previous work @xcite , it was shown that in the strong coupling limit , when the number of flavors @xmath0 is greater than or equal to 7 , quarks are deconfined and chiral symmetry is restored at zero temperature , if the quark mass is lighter than a critical value . on the other hand , it is well - known that when @xmath0 exceeds @xmath5 , asymptotic freedom is lost .    in this work",
    "we investigate the problem of what is the condition on the number of flavors for quark confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the continuum limit , using the wilson quark action and the standard one - plaquette gauge action .",
    "we first clarify the phase structure at zero temperature for general number of flavors , in particular , for @xmath6 .",
    "when the phase diagram becomes clear , we are able to see what kind of continuum limit exists and eventually answer the problem given above .    in order to reveal the structure of the deconfining phase , we increase",
    "@xmath0 up to 300 , because the region of the deconfining phase at zero temperature becomes larger with larger @xmath0 , and consequently the structure becomes clear , as shown below .",
    "then combining all data including the case of small @xmath0 , we are able to conjecture the phase structure for general number of flavors . through this systematic study of the deconfining phase for general number of flavors ,",
    "we are also able to understand the behavior of the quark mass @xmath7 ( defined through an axial - vector ward identity ) and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath9 in the deconfining phase at finite temperatures in particular at small @xmath10 for small number of flavors such as @xmath4 and 3 .",
    "the lattice sizes are @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , 6 or 8) , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we use an anti - periodic boundary condition for quarks in the @xmath17 direction and periodic boundary conditions otherwise .",
    "when the hadron spectrum is calculated , the lattice is duplicated in the direction of lattice size 10 for @xmath18 , which we call the @xmath19 direction .",
    "we call the pion screening mass simply the pion mass and similarly for the quark mass",
    ". the current quark mass @xmath7 is defined by an axial - vector ward identity @xcite .",
    "we use the hybrid r algorithm for the quark matrix inversion . as @xmath0 increases we have to decrease @xmath20 , such as @xmath20 = 0.0025 for @xmath21 , to reduce @xmath22 errors .",
    "we have checked that the errors are sufficiently small selecting typical cases .",
    "we first investigate the free case , because the free case is important as a reference to understand the structure of the deconfining phase .",
    "we will show later that the @xmath9 dependence of the pion mass in the deconfining phase is quite similar to that of free quarks for any @xmath0 and @xmath10 .    because the wilson formalism lifts the doublers by the wilson term",
    ", there is only one pole in the free quark propagator at @xmath24 .",
    "however , there is reminiscence of doublers .    in fig .",
    "[ free ] we plot the effective pion mass obtained at @xmath25 from the pion propagator .",
    "the four cases shown there correspond to those for @xmath26 and 8 with an anti - periodic or the periodic boundary condition in the @xmath17 direction .    in the case of the periodic boundary condition , there are almost no differences between the @xmath26 and 8 cases .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath7 at @xmath27 and the behavior of @xmath8 for @xmath28 roughly given by @xmath29 are all as naively expected .    for @xmath30 ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath8 is somewhat complicated .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath31 at @xmath32 is due to doublers ; one of momenta in spatial direction is @xmath33 . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the momentum - energy ( dispersion ) relation is completely opposite to the usual one : the energy is a decreasing function of the magnitude of momentum for the case of equal momenta in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the energy becomes infinity at zero momenta like the infinite mass case , while it is finite for other modes of momenta .",
    "therefore the appearance of the peak of @xmath31 at @xmath34 is due to a superposition of contributions from several modes of momenta .",
    "the behavior of @xmath7 defined through the axial - vector ward identity is also complicated at @xmath30 due to doublers . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the rightmost @xmath35 state ( at @xmath27 for @xmath23 ) as simply the massless quark , or @xmath35 , distinguished from the other @xmath35 states , unless otherwise stated .",
    "when an anti - periodic boundary condition is imposed , the position as well as the height of the peak of @xmath31 at @xmath34 does not change so much . on the other hand , for the massless quark at @xmath27 ,",
    "the pion mass takes a value which is roughly twice the lowest matsubara frequency , for the both cases of @xmath36 and 8 .",
    "the behavior around @xmath37 is similar , but indicates more complicated structure .",
    "we now study the case of @xmath39 as in the previous work @xcite .",
    "[ kd.nf]a shows the results of the deconfining transition points @xmath38 at @xmath39 obtained on @xmath36 lattices for various numbers of @xmath0 ( see also fig .",
    "[ kd.nf]b ) .    the data of plaquette ( fig .",
    "[ nf240.pl ] ) for @xmath21 at @xmath39 indicates that the deconfining transition is of first order and that the location of the transition point is independent of @xmath40 for large @xmath40 ( @xmath41 for @xmath36 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 and 16 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the transition is bulk as is confirmed in our previous work for @xmath44 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ kd.nf]a the transition points at @xmath45 for @xmath44 , 240 and 300 are also included .",
    "these values are roughly those for the bulk transition points at zero temperature .    as @xmath0 increases up to 240 , @xmath46 approaches toward or exceeds the value 8 , which is the value of @xmath9 for a massless free quark . because of this , for @xmath47 , we are able to see a wide region of the deconfining phase in the whole range of @xmath10",
    ". therefore we first intensively investigate the case @xmath21 , and then decrease @xmath0 .",
    "fig .  [ nf240.mass ] shows the results of @xmath8 and @xmath48 for @xmath21 at @xmath39 , 2.0 , 4.5 , 6.0 , and 100 on the @xmath36 lattice .",
    "a very striking fact is that the shape of @xmath8 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath9 only slightly changes for @xmath49 when the value of @xmath10 decreases from @xmath50 down 0 .",
    "only the position of the local minimum of @xmath8 at @xmath51 , which corresponds to the vanishing point of @xmath7 , slightly shifts toward smaller @xmath9 .",
    "we obtain similar results also for @xmath43 .    from these data we propose the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ nf240.phase ] for @xmath21 .",
    "the dark shaded line is the phase boundary between the confining phase and the deconfining phase at zero temperature .",
    "when @xmath12 or 8 , the boundary line bends down at finite @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "[ nf240.phase ] , due to the finite temperature phase transition of the confining phase .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the @xmath35 line .",
    "this line also corresponds to the minimum point of @xmath8 .",
    "we have also calculated the quark propagator in the landau gauge and checked that chiral symmetry of the propagator , @xmath52 , is actually satisfied on the @xmath35 line .",
    "the results for the case @xmath53 are essentially the same as those for @xmath21 except for very small shifts of the transition point and the minimum point of @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath35 point at @xmath23 is the trivial ir fixed point for @xmath1 .",
    "the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ nf240.phase ] suggests that there are no other fixed points on the @xmath35 line at finite @xmath10 .    in order to confirm this",
    ", we investigate the direction of renormalization group ( rg ) flow along the @xmath35 line for @xmath21 , using a monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method .",
    "one problem here is that it is practically impossible to make simulations in the massless limit at zero temperature due to the existence of zero modes in the quark matrix .",
    "therefore , we impose an anti - periodic boundary condition in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "we make a block transformation for a change of scale factor 2 , and estimate the quantity @xmath54 for the change of @xmath55 .",
    "we generate configurations on an @xmath56 lattice on the @xmath35 points at @xmath39 and 6.0 and make twice blockings .",
    "we also generate configurations on a @xmath57 lattice and make once a blocking .",
    "then we calculate @xmath58 by matching the value of the plaquette at each step .",
    "gauge theory , in particular in the deconfining phase , that one has to make a more careful analysis using several types of wilson loop to extract a precise value of @xmath54 .",
    "we reserve elaboration of this point and a fine tuning of @xmath9 at each @xmath10 for future works . ]    from the matching , we obtain @xmath59 for @xmath39 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 . the value obtained from the perturbation theory is @xmath62 at @xmath63 for @xmath21 .",
    "the signs are the same and the magnitudes are comparable .",
    "this suggests that the directions of rg flow on the @xmath35 line at @xmath39 and 6.0 are the same as that at @xmath23 for @xmath21 .",
    "this further suggests that there are no fixed points at finite @xmath10 .",
    "all of the above imply that the theory is trivial in the case of @xmath21 .",
    "now we decrease the value of @xmath0 from 240 . fig .",
    "[ 300to18 ] shows @xmath8 and @xmath48 for various @xmath0 , from 300 down to 18 , at @xmath61 and 0 .",
    "when @xmath61 , the shapes of @xmath8 are almost identical to each other , except for a slight shift toward smaller @xmath9 as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "when @xmath39 , the boundary of the first order phase transition between the deconfining phase and the confining phase moves toward smaller @xmath9 and therefore the range of the deconfining phase decreases : @xmath65 , 8 , 7.6 , 7.2 , 6.1 for @xmath66 , 240 , 180 , 120 and 60 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kd.nf ] . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the value of @xmath46 decreases down to 5.0 .    due to the fact that the confining phase invades the deconfining phase ,",
    "the massless line in the deconfining phase hits the boundary at finite @xmath10 when @xmath0 becomes small . for example , in the case of @xmath67 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nf18.phase ] , it hits at @xmath68  4.5 .",
    "although the area of the deconfining phase decreases with decreasing @xmath0 , the shape and the position of @xmath8 in the part of deconfining phase only slightly change from @xmath53 to 18 .",
    "the values of @xmath7 as functions of @xmath9 also show only slight changes in the deconfining phase .",
    "these facts , combined with the perturbative result that for @xmath1 , @xmath23 is the ir fixed point , suggest that the rg flow along the massless quark in the deconfining phase is the same as that for @xmath21 . in this case , the theory is trivial for @xmath1 .",
    "case , we do not expect any qualitative differences between the cases of @xmath69 and 18 . ]",
    "when @xmath70 , the theory is asymptotic free . on the other hand , quark confinement is lost for @xmath6 even in the strong coupling limit @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "therefore the question is what happens for the cases @xmath2 in the deconfining phase .",
    "we have intensively simulated the cases @xmath71 and 7 .",
    "see the results for the case @xmath44 in fig .",
    "the gross feature of the phase diagram does not much differ from the case of @xmath67 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ nf18.phase ] .",
    "one crucial point is that there is no chiral limit in the confining phase at least for @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests that quarks are not confined in the continuum limit .",
    "a more subtle point is whether there is a difference between the case @xmath1 and the case @xmath2 concerning the deconfining phase . for @xmath70 , the massless point at @xmath23 is a uv fixed point .",
    "therefore the direction of the rg flow around @xmath23 is opposite to that for @xmath1 . in order to study the phase structure around @xmath73 ,",
    "we have performed a mcrg study for the case @xmath71 similar to that for the case of @xmath21 .",
    "we have investigated the rg flow along the maximum of @xmath8 , because this line roughly corresponds to an infinite quark mass line in a sense explained in sec .",
    "[ sect : free ] .",
    "we have found that the rg flow at @xmath39 and @xmath61 are opposite and the flow changes the direction around @xmath74 .",
    "this result suggests that there is a fixed point on the @xmath35 line .",
    "the flow of rg on the @xmath35 line at @xmath75 is the same as that at @xmath23 , which is opposite to that of the case of @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that the location of the fixed point is at @xmath76 . because of the fact that the massless line @xmath35 hits the boundary between the two phases around @xmath74 , it is difficult to determine the location of the fixed point .",
    "although we have not been able to locate the fixed point , we propose the phase structure , based on the consideration given above , that there is a non - trivial ir fixed point at finite @xmath10 @xcite for @xmath2 . of",
    "course we have to make a detailed rg study to confirm that there is a non - trivial fixed point , which we reserve for future works .",
    "the existence of a non - trivial fixed point implies that the theory in the continuum limit is a non - trivial theory with anomalous dimensions , however , without confinement .",
    "for @xmath77 and 3 at finite temperatures , it was shown that @xmath7 has an unexpected @xmath9 dependence in the deconfining phase when @xmath10 is smaller than about 5.3 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 as a function of @xmath9 also shows a cusp . in this section",
    "we concentrate on these issues .",
    "( for the discussion on the phase structure at zero temperature , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references in it . )    = 6.9 cm    we point out that the behaviors of @xmath7 and @xmath31 in the high temperature deconfining phase for @xmath3 at @xmath78 are similar to those in the deconfining phase at zero temperature for larger @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ nf2.mq ] , the value of @xmath48 is plotted vs.  @xmath9 for from @xmath21 down to @xmath4 at @xmath79 .",
    "results at @xmath75 are similar .",
    "the value of @xmath48 for the free quark case is also plotted .",
    "there are two major trends when @xmath0 decreases from 240 down to 2 : one is an overall shift of the function @xmath48 in the deconfining phase to smaller @xmath9 and shrinkage of the shape with decreasing @xmath0 . the other is a shift of the transition point from the confining phase to the deconfining phase toward smaller @xmath9 .    it should be noted that except for the overall shift and shrinkage mentioned above , the shape of the function @xmath48 in terms of @xmath9 in the deconfining phase is quite similar for all @xmath0 and also similar to that of a free quark .",
    "thus the behavior of @xmath7 as well as @xmath8 as functions of @xmath9 in the deconfining phase at @xmath78 can be understood essentially as those of free quarks for @xmath30 .",
    "= 6.6 cm    we further note that for @xmath4 and 3 , the massless quark point ( the rightmost @xmath35 ) in the deconfining phase is different from the @xmath80 point in the confining phase for @xmath78 .",
    "the difference is illustrated in the phase diagram for @xmath4 on the @xmath81 plane ( see fig .  [ nf2.phase ] ) .",
    "on the @xmath80 line , both @xmath8 and @xmath7 vanish in the confining phase at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature transition for @xmath36 occur on the line @xmath82 .",
    "the massless quark line for @xmath36 in the high temperature deconfining phase agrees with the @xmath80 line at @xmath83 .",
    "however , they deviate from each other at @xmath78 .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the value of @xmath7 does not depend on the phase when @xmath84 , while it strongly depends on the phase when @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "based on numerical results combined with the result of the perturbation theory we propose the following picture : there are three categories depending on the number of flavors @xmath0 : a free theory for @xmath1 , a non - trivial ir fixed point for @xmath2 and confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking for @xmath3 .",
    "the conclusion that there are three categories depending on @xmath0 is in accord with recent theoretical works of @xmath85 super - symmetric qcd @xcite .",
    "we also find that , for any @xmath6 and for @xmath3 at @xmath78 , the @xmath9 dependences of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the deconfining phase are essentially the same as those of free quarks for @xmath30 , which show non - trivial structure due to doublers .",
    "the peculiar behavior of @xmath7 as well as the cusp structure of @xmath8 in the deconfining phase at @xmath78 for @xmath4 @xcite can be understood in terms of the overall shift in @xmath9 and shrinkage of this structure .",
