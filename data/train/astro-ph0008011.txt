    "the abundance of metals in the low - density intergalactic medium ( igm ) at high redshift is of interest for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , the metallicity can be used to distinguish between different enrichment mechanisms and to constrain the amount of star formation at high redshift .",
    "secondly , the relative abundances of ions with different ionization potentials can be used to derive the spectrum of the integrated uv background from stars and quasars . for both purposes",
    "it is essential to measure the metal abundances in gas of low density , away from the influence of local sources of ionizing radiation and locally produced metals .",
    "resonant ly@xmath2  absorption by neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to distant quasars results in a forest of absorption lines bluewards of the quasar s",
    "ly@xmath2  emission line . with the advent of the high - resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) on the keck telescope ,",
    "it became clear that many of the high column density ly@xmath2  lines ( @xmath7 ) show associated  absorption ( e.g. , cowie et al .  1995 ) .",
    "although increasing the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) reveals  systems of progressively lower column density ,  lines corresponding to low column density ly@xmath2  lines are generally far too weak to detect ( e.g. , ellison et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the success of cosmological simulations in reproducing the observations of the ly@xmath2  forest has convincingly shown that the low column density forest ( @xmath8 ) at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) arises in a smoothly fluctuating igm , with individual lines corresponding to local density maxima of moderate overdensity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the interplay between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling that is due to the universal expansion results in a tight temperature - density relation , which is well approximated by a power - law , @xmath11 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath2  optical depth is proportional to the neutral hydrogen density , which in photoionization equilibrium is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "hence the optical depth depends on the underlying baryon overdensity , @xmath13 .",
    "the constant of proportionality is an increasing function of redshift , at @xmath6 , an optical depth of one corresponds to slightly overdense gas .",
    "cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) realized that the tight correlation between optical depth and gas overdensity makes a pixel - by - pixel analysis of metal abundances useful . by measuring the median /  optical depth ratio as a function of @xmath4",
    ", they were able to show that the igm is enriched with a roughly constant /  ratio down to @xmath14 at @xmath6 .",
    "ellison et al .  ( 2000 ) showed explicitly that directly detected  lines account for only a small fraction of the total amount of metals in the forest , as inferred from a pixel analysis .",
    "although other metal lines have been detected , ( @xmath151548 , 1551 ) has so far proven the most sensitive since it is the strongest line redwards of ly@xmath2  ( @xmath161216 ) , where there is little contamination from other absorption lines .",
    "however , simulations show that at high redshift , photoionized  ( @xmath151032 , 1038 ) should be a much better probe of the metallicity of the igm in regions close to the mean density ( chaffee et al .  1986 ;",
    "rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz 1997 ; hellsten et al .",
    "1998 ) . in practice",
    "it has proven very difficult to detect  at high redshift because it lies deep in the ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath17  ( @xmath18 ) forest .",
    "since lu & savage ( 1993 ) established the presence of  in intervening absorbers by stacking lyman limit systems that show  absorption ,  has been detected at high redshift in several lyman limit systems ( vogel & reimers 1995 , kirkman & tytler 1997 ; 1999 ) .",

    ",  absorbers have been shown to be common ( e.g. , bergeron et al .",
    "1994 ) , so common in fact that they may harbor a large fraction of the baryons ( burles & tytler 1996 ; tripp , savage & jenkins 2000 ) .",
    "these low redshift systems probably correspond to hot , shock heated gas in the potential wells of ( groups of ) galaxies , which may well be collisionally ionized .",
    "we have carried out a pixel - by - pixel search for  in the spectra of eight quasars , spanning the redshift range @xmath204.5 .",
    "we clearly detect  at @xmath21 , down to very low  optical depths , @xmath3 , which is an order of magnitude lower than the best  measurements can probe .",
    "we analyzed spectra of the eight quasars listed in column 6 of table  1 .",
    "the spectra of q1101 , j2233 and q1122 were taken during the commissioning i and science verification observations of the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) and have been released by eso for public use .",
    "they were reduced with the eso - maintained midas echelle package ( see kim , dodorico , & cristiani 2000 , in preparation ) for details on the data reduction ) .",
    "the other spectra were obtained with the hires spectrograph ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on the keck telescope .",
    "the reduction procedures for these quasars can be found in barlow & sargent  ( 1997 ) and sargent , barlow & rauch ( 2000 , in preparation ) . the hires and uves spectra have a nominal velocity resolution of 6.6 and 6.7  @xmath22 ( fwhm ) and a pixel size of 0.04 and 0.05    respectively . to avoid confusion with the ly@xmath17  forest",

    "ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath17emission lines .",
    "in addition , spectral regions close to the quasar ( typically @xmath23 ) were excluded to avoid proximity effects .",
    "regions in the ly@xmath2  forest thought to be contaminated by metal lines were excluded .",
    "the mean absorption increases rapidly bluewards of the quasar s ly@xmath17emission line becaue of the growing number of absorption lines other than ly@xmath2 . for quasars at @xmath24",
    "the increase in the absorption is dominated by higher order ly lines , corresponding to ly@xmath2  lines which fall in between the quasar s",
    "ly@xmath17  and ly@xmath2  emission lines ( i.e.  in the ly@xmath2  forest ) . at lower redshift",
    "the hydrogen lines have smaller column densities and metal lines contribute significantly to the mean absorption .",
    "the increase in the mean absorption towards the blue , raises the threshold for detecting  absorption in the ly@xmath2forest considerably .",
    "moreover , the s / n in the  region generally decreases towards the blue , raising the detection threshold further .",
    "we therefore analyzed the red and blue halves , i.e.  the high and low redshift halves , of each ly@xmath2  forest spectrum separately ( for those quasars for which our spectral coverage extends far enough into the blue ) .",

    "the -pixel pairs are binned according to their  optical depth and the median  and  optical depths are computed for each bin .",
    "this technique enables us to probe the  abundance down to much lower densities than is possible by fitting lines .",
    "its main advantage over , for example , the stacking method is its robustness .",
    "being a median , it is relatively insensitive to ( non - gaussian ) noise , contamination from non-  lines , problems that severely compromise the stacking method , which is a mean ( see ellison et al .",

    "its main limitation is that it measures an _ apparent _  optical depth , @xmath31 , which is in general not the same as the true  optical depth because of contamination .",

    "if the contamination is negligible , then noise will cause us to underestimate @xmath35 .",
    "for , which falls redwards of the ly@xmath2  forest , noise is the limiting factor and ellison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) therefore only used the weaker component if a @xmath36 detection was predicted , based on the signal in the stronger component . for  however , contamination is a much greater problem and we therefore take the the minimum if the expected signal in the weaker component is greater than 0.5@xmath37 , i.e.  if @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the rms amplitude of the noise at the position of , 1038 ( as given by the normalized noise array ) .    when a pixel is close to saturation [ @xmath40 , we use up to 10 higher order ly lines to determine the optical depth : @xmath41 .",
    "we limit the effect of noise features by requiring @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the rms noise amplitude at the position of ly@xmath44 ) .",
    "the number of higher order lines available is different for each quasar spectrum and varies also within a single spectrum .",
    "however , since the number of pixels with a given @xmath4 decreases rapidly for @xmath45 , the misbinning of  due to missing higher orders affects only the highest @xmath4 bins .",
    "we use logarithmic @xmath4 bins of size 0.35  dex ( 0.5  dex for the two lowest redshift quasars ) and estimate the error in the medians by bootstrap resampling error in the median is then the square root of the variance in the median over the bootstrap realizations . ] .",
    "[ fig : uphalf ]    figure  1 shows the results from a pixel analysis of the samples listed in table  1 .",
    "the apparent  optical depth is clearly correlated with @xmath4 at @xmath46 down to @xmath3 , indicating that  is detected in the ly@xmath2  forest . at @xmath473.5",
    "we detect  only at very high  optical depths , @xmath48 , while at @xmath49 @xmath35 and @xmath50 appear uncorrelated .",
    "the transition seems to occur at @xmath513.5 .",
    "if contamination and noise , which are independent of @xmath4 , dominate over absorption from , then @xmath52 will flatten off at the detection limit .",
    "ellison et al.(2000 ) analyzed a very high quality spectrum of q1422 + 231 ( ( s / n)@xmath53 ) and found that @xmath54 flattens off below @xmath55 .",
    "we find that the correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath4 continues down to much lower @xmath4 , indicating that oxygen has been detected in gas of very low density contrast ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the horizontal , dashed lines indicate the median @xmath31 corresponding to a random  pixel , i.e.  the median @xmath57 for the set of all  pixels .",
    "this reference level includes contributions from , from contaminating non-  lines and from noise . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the contribution of  to this level is negligible and the level is effectively the detection limit . for @xmath58 on the other hand ,  accounts for a significant part of the total absorption .",
    "hence the detection limit is lower than the reference level and @xmath31 drops below the dashed line at low @xmath4 .",
    "we stress that because of noise and especially contamination , the measured , apparent  optical depths could differ considerably from the true values .",
    "we tried to estimate the effects of noise and contamination , which vary systematically across the spectrum , by analyzing synthetic spectra generated by drawing  voigt profiles at random from observed line lists until the mean absorption in the ly@xmath2  forest equals the observed value .",
    "we then added the corresponding  absorption lines using a fixed /  column density ratio and a fixed @xmath59-parameter ratio .",
    "finally , higher order ly lines and noise were added using the  line list and the noise array respectively .",
    "we found that the simulations agree reasonably well with the observations for @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 , although the results are sensitive to the assumed ratio of @xmath59-parameters .",
    "although encouraging , these monte carlo simulations are clearly too simplistic to derive the intrinsic /  ratios .",
    "the effects of noise and contamination can only be modeled accurately by calibrating the method against synthetic spectra extracted from hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "this should be done separately for each observed spectrum , using synthetic spectra that resemble the observed spectrum in detail .",
    "we leave such a quantitative analysis for a future paper but note that the effects that prevent us from deriving the actual  abundance , will reduce any intrinsic correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath31 , making a detection of such a correlation a robust result .    for a fixed  abundance , the value of the reference level ( fig .",
    "1 , dashed lines ) increases with decreasing s / n and with increasing redshift .",
    "the latter effect is more important and is due to the increase in the number and strength of contaminating ly series lines with redshift , which is a direct consequence of the expansion of the universe .",
    "as the universe expands , the column densities of lines corresponding to absorbers of a fixed overdensity decrease ( the evolution of the ionizing background and the growth of structure are less important ) .",
    "this results in an increase of the amount of contamination , and thus the detection threshold , with redshift .",
    "note that this effect is opposite to the increase in contamination towards the blue ( i.e.  low redshift ) end of a single quasar spectrum , which is a consequence of the growing number of interlopers ( see section 2 ) . like the column density",
    ", the  optical depth corresponding to a fixed overdensity also increases with redshift .",
    "this complicates the comparison of the @xmath4 level below which the correlation with  flattens off in samples of different redshifts .",
    "while an  optical depth of one corresponds to about the mean density at @xmath6 , it corresponds to an overdensity of a few at @xmath64 and to slightly underdense gas at @xmath65 .    for the quasars q1107 , q1422 and q2233",
    "our spectral coverage is sufficient to analyze the blue half of the forest .",
    "we find no correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath4 in any of these samples .",
    "as discussed above , this is a consequence of the large number of contaminating absorption lines from intervening absorbers and/or the low s / n of the data and does not imply that there is no . in principle , even more  could be uncovered by looking at a smaller part of the spectrum",
    ". the contamination in the upper redshift quarter for example , will be lower than in the upper half .",
    "however , decreasing the number of pixels further would bring the redshift path into the regime of large - scale structures and the samples would therefore no longer be representative .",
    "this may already be the case for the two lowest redshift samples , for which the number of pixels showing  absorption is much smaller than for the higher redshift samples . nevertheless , we have tried smaller samples and found that the correlation strengthens somewhat for 1422 but not for 2237 .",
    "figure  2 demonstrates that the  that we detect at low @xmath50 is not associated with detectable  absorption .",
    "the solid line indicates the apparent  absorption in 1442 .",
    "the dashed line shows the result obtained after all pixels that have nonzero absorption at the @xmath66 level [ @xmath67 have been excluded .",
    "the dashed curve only falls below the solid curve for @xmath68 , indicating that some of the stronger  systems have been excluded .",
    "the fact that the two curves are almost indistinguishable for @xmath69 shows that  is detectable in absorbers for which  absorption is too weak to detect and is thus direct observational proof of the prediction that  is a more sensitive probe of the metallicity in low - density gas than .",

    "we have searched for  absorption in the spectra of eight quasars spanning the redshift range @xmath204.5 and reported the first detection of  in the low - density igm at high redshift .",
    "we analyzed the spectra pixel by pixel and detected a positive correlation between the optical depths in  and in the corresponding  pixels down to @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude lower in @xmath4 than the best  measurements can probe and constitutes the first firm detection of metals in _ underdense _ gas .",
    "we showed that the  signal does not come from systems for which  is detectable , and this confirms the prediction that  is a much better tracer of metals in low - density gas than .",
    "although the very strong absorbers may well be collisionally ionized ( e.g. , kirkman & tytler  1999 ) , the volume filling factor of this hot gas is much smaller than that of photoionized gas ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "the ubiquitous  detected here , arises in gas that is too dilute for collisional ionization to be effective .",
    "photons of at least 8.4ryd are needed to create  and hence we would not expect to detect photoionized  if the reionization of , for which photons of at least 4ryd are required , is not yet complete .",
    "measurements of the  ly@xmath2  opacity ( heap et al .  2000 and references therein ) and the temperature of the igm ( schaye et al.2000 , ricotti , gnedin & shull 2000 ) suggest that the reionization of helium may have been completed at @xmath6 .",
    "although our non - detection of  at @xmath5 is consistent with enhanced photoionization from a hardening of the ionizing background below @xmath6 , it could also be caused by the increased level of contamination from ly series lines .",

    "a comparison with simulations could clarify how noise and contamination from ly series lines affect the apparent optical depth , what fraction of the low - density gas is enriched and what the scatter in the /  ratio is , thereby providing strong constraints on theoretical models for the enrichment of the igm .",
