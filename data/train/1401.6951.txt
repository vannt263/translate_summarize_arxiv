    "social inequality is often measured by the gini - index or gini coefficient ( @xmath0 ) @xcite obtained from the area between the diagonal ( equality line ) and the lorenz curve , given by the plot of cumulative fraction ( @xmath15 ) of income or wealth ( when ordered from lowest to highest income or wealth ) against the corresponding cumulative fraction ( @xmath16 ) of people sharing them in any society ( at any particular time or year ) . in a similar way ,",
    "we measure here the inequalities in the output of the various academic institutions and universities by determining @xmath0-values obtained from lorenz curves of the institutions obtained by plotting the cumulative fraction of the citations of the papers ( when ordered from lowest to highest citations ) published in any year from that institution , against the corresponding cumulation fraction of papers sharing those citations ( see fig . [ sinp-2010.eps ] ) . the gini index or @xmath0-value is again given by twice the ( normalized ) area of the region ( shaded in fig .",
    "[ sinp-2010.eps ] ) between the equality line or diagonal through the origin and the lorenz curve .",
    "we introduce then a new inequality measure , the @xmath9-index ( @xmath9 for kolkata ; in view of the extreme nature of social inequalities in kolkata @xcite ) which is given by the coordinate value @xmath9 in the @xmath16-axis in fig .",
    "[ sinp-2010.eps ] of the cutting point of the lorenz line with the diagonal orthogonal to the equality line . as one can see in the case of income inequality",
    ", it says the fraction ( @xmath10 ) of people earn more than that earned by fraction @xmath9 of people in the country or society . in the case of an academic institution",
    "the @xmath9-value says that the fraction @xmath10 of their papers published ( in a year ) from that institution have more citations than those earned by @xmath9 fraction of papers . as is obvious from fig .",
    "[ sinp-2010.eps ] , @xmath3 corresponds to complete equality ( lorenz curve merges with the diagonal ) while @xmath4 corresponds to extreme inequity .",
    "the corresponding values of the @xmath9-index are @xmath17 for @xmath3 for complete equality and @xmath18 for @xmath4 for limiting ( extreme ) value of inequality . in the income or wealth inequality context",
    ", pareto had already observed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that a tiny fraction ( typically less than @xmath19 ) of ( rich ) people possess @xmath20 of the total wealth of the nations .",
    "the @xmath9-index defined here gives a more quantitative measure of this inequality .",
    "also in the context of academic institutions or universities , the @xmath9-index gives a ( normalized ) complementary measure of the @xmath21-index @xcite equivalent for the respective institution for that year ; @xmath21-index of a scientist gives the number @xmath21 of his or her papers , each of which has at least @xmath21 citations .",
    "apart from @xmath9-index and @xmath0-index , we analyze these citation data for institutions and journals by measuring two other inequality indices introduced recently : pietra index or @xmath22-index @xcite and median index or @xmath23-index @xcite .",
    "@xmath22-index is defined as the maximal vertical distance between the lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality in fig .",

    "@xmath23-index is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 denoting the lorentz curve ) .",
    "values for @xmath22-index and @xmath23-index both range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ; the value @xmath1 represents complete equality while value @xmath2 represents extreme inequality in the society . in this article , we measure inequality in income , citations for papers published in institutions and journals as examples for inequality in society , by using some newly defined quantities .     of the ( a ) income or wealth or ( b ) citations when ordered from the lowest to the highest income , wealth ( for ( a ) ) or citations ( for ( b ) ) in any particular year for any country ( for ( a ) ) or any institution ( for ( b ) ) , against the cumulative fraction ( _ n _ ) of the people in the country ( for ( a ) ) or the fraction of papers published in that year ( for ( b ) ) sharing that income or wealth ( for ( a ) ) or citations ( for ( b ) ) respectively . the diagonal starting from the origin then gives the equality line ( corresponding to uniform income or wealth that year per head of the population of that country or citations per paper published that year from the institution ) .",
    "the ( normalized ) ratio of the area of the shaded region ( between the equality line and the lorenz curve ) and of the triangle formed by equality line ( effectively twice the area value of the shaded region ) gives the gini - index value ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the ordinate @xmath9 ( on the @xmath16 axis ) of the intersection point of the lorenz curve and the other diagonal ( perpendicular to the equality line ) gives the @xmath9-index .",
    "this @xmath9-index value gives another measurement ( similar to the @xmath21-index for individual scientists ) : @xmath9-value of a society says that @xmath10 fraction of people ( for ( a ) ) or papers ( for ( b ) ) possess more income , wealth ( for ( a ) ) or citations ( for ( b ) ) than those earned by the rest @xmath9 fraction of people ( for ( a ) ) or papers ( for ( b)).,width=302 ]",

    "ii and iii we give the estimates of the values of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 indices for different institutions and universities across the world in different times ( years ) .",
    "these estimates are made from the corresponding lorenz curves drawn numerically from the respective data sets . for citations of the papers ,",
    "the data are taken from isi web of science @xcite and are counted up to the year 2013 , while the publications ( corresponding to the institutions of origin or to the journal where published ) are for the individual years of publication ( see e.g. , tables ii - iv ) . assuming that the lorenz curve can be approximated by two discontinuous straight lines forming a triangle with vertex opposite to the equality line given by intersection point of the lorenz curve and the diagonal perpendicular to the equality line , one gets @xmath27 . however",
