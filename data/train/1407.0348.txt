    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are mysterious transients discovered recently ( lorimer et al . 2007 ; thornton et al .",
    "their physical origin is subject to intense debate ( e.g. falcke & rezzolla 2014 ; totani 2013 ; kashiyama et al .",
    "2013 ; popov & postnov 2013 ; zhang 2014 ; loeb et al .",
    "2014 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "if at least some frbs are of a cosmological origin , as indicated by the anomolously large dispersion measure ( dm ) , their redshift information together with the measured dm offer a powerful tool to study cosmology , including inferring the baryon content and reionization history of the universe ( deng & zhang 2014 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "2014 ) , and directly constraining cosmological parameters and dark matter equation of state ( gao et al . 2014 ; zhou et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the error boxes of frbs detected by parkes multi - beam survey are typically hundreds of square arc - minutes ( thornton et al . 2013 ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to pin down their host galaxies and derive their redshifts .",
    "detecting counterparts of frbs in other wavelengths would be essential to localize frbs .",
    "kashiyama et al .",
    "( 2013 ) suggested binary white dwarf ( wd ) mergers as the source of frbs , and proposed possible associations of some frbs with type ia sne or x - ray debris disk emission .",
    "motivated by swift data showing evidence of a supra - massive neutron star collapsing into a black hole ( troja et al .",
    "2007 ; lyons et al . 2010 ; rowlinson et al . 2010 , 2013 ; l & zhang 2014 ; yi et al . 2014 ) , zhang ( 2014 ) suggested possible associations of a small fraction of frbs with grbs .",
    "two tentative associations of frb - like events with grbs may have been discovered by bannister et al .",
    "unfortunately , the redshifts of the two grbs were not measured .",
    "another possibility is to search for the afterglow of frbs .",
    "zhang ( 2014 ) estimated the brightness of frb afterglows , and found that it is very faint owing to their low energetics .",
    "he suggested that for a typical frb at a cosmological distance , the peak radio afterglow flux is dimmer than the frb itself by 6 - 7 orders of magnitude ( at the @xmath0 level ) . in this paper , we calculate the multi - wavelength frb afterglows in detail .",
    "we apply the standard external shock synchrotron emission afterglow model of grbs ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al . 1998 ; see gao et al .",
    "2013a for a recent , detailed review ) .",
    "the simplest afterglow model has several free parameters : the total kinetic energy @xmath1 , the initial lorentz factor @xmath2 , the number density of the ambient medium @xmath3 ; the equipartition parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 for electrons and magnetic fields , respectively ; and the electron injection spectral index @xmath6 .",
    "if one considers a pair of ( forward and reverse ) shocks , the micro - physics parameters can be different for the two shocks .",
    "so altogether one has nine parameters .",
    "the forward shock ( fs ) emission component is guaranteed . whether a bright reverse shock ( rs ) emission component exists depends on the unknown magnetization parameter ( the ratio between poynting flux and matter flux , usually denoted as @xmath7 ) of the outflow ( zhang & kobayashi 2005 ; mimica et al .",
    "2009 ; mizuno et al .",
    "most frb models invoke highly magnetized neutron stars or black holes ( e.g. falcke & rezzola 2014 ; totani 2013 ; zhang 2014 ; popov & postnov 2013 ) .",
    "for example , in the `` magnetic hair '' ejection model invoking the implosion of a supra - massive neutron star ( falcke & rezzola 2014 ; zhang 2014 ) , an frb is emitted in the ejected magnetosphere .",
    "the outflow is therefore likely highly magnetized at the central engine .",
    "the outflow is accelerated via a magnetic pressure gradient ( e.g. komissarov et al .",
    "2009 ; granot et al .",
    "2011 ) , so that @xmath7 decreases with radius with the expense of increasing @xmath8 .",
    "significant magnetic dissipation would also occur during the frb emission phase .",
    "therefore the @xmath7 value after the dissipation , especially at the deceleration radius , is not known .",
    "if it is already below unity , as envisaged in some models ( e.g. zhang & yan 2011 ) , a bright reverse shock emission component may be expected ( zhang et al . 2003 ; zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .    in the following we neglect these complications , and only consider a standard fireball defined by the total energy @xmath1 and initial lorentz factor @xmath2 . for faint afterglows of frbs ,",
    "to the first order the details of jet composision would not affect the global picture .",
    "the deceleration time scale @xmath9 , which is also the time when the reverse shock crosses the shell ( for a non - magnetized outflow ) , can be approximated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sedov length .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are poorly constrained .",
    "the observed frbs have an energy @xmath12 erg assuming a redshift @xmath13 ( thornton et al .",
    "observations of radio pulsars suggest that their radio emission efficiency is typically low , especially for more energetic ones ( szary et al .",
    "2014 ) . as a result",
    ", the total kinetic energy in an frb outflow can be significantly greater than the frb energy . within the supra - massive neutron star implosion scenario ,",
    "the total energy in the ejecta is essentially the total magnetic energy of the neutron star magnetosphere , which can be as large as @xmath14 erg for a magnetar ( zhang 2014 ) . in the following ,",
    "we allow @xmath1 to be in a wide range from @xmath15 erg .",
    "various constraints on the frb emission mechanisms suggest that the bulk motion lorentz factor of an frb is at least 100 ( e.g. falcke & rezzolla 2014 ; katz 2014 ) . in the following ,",
    "we adopt a conservative value @xmath16 . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the predictions of afterglow flux do not depend on @xmath2 . for a higher @xmath2",
    ", @xmath9 would move to an earlier epoch , and the peak afterglow flux would be increased accordingly . for @xmath18 erg , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ,",
    "one has @xmath21",
    "s.    the synchrotron radiation spectrum from the fs or rs can be characterized by a multi - segment broken power law separated by three characteristic frequencies : the minimum synchrotron frequency ( corresponding to electrons with the minimum lorentz factor ) , the cooling frequency @xmath22 , and the self - absorption frequency @xmath23 ( sari et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the peak flux of the spectrum is denoted as @xmath24 .",
    "based on the standard prescription ( e.g. sari et al .",
    "1998 ; wu et al . 2003 ; yi et al . 2013 ; gao et al .",
    "2013a ) , one can calculate the afterglow emission from frbs . at the shock crossing time @xmath9",
    ", the fs emission can be characterized by @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 here the typcial shock micro - physics parameters are normalized to @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . the evolution of the four parameters ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ; yi et al . 2013 ; gao et al .",
    "2013a ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 because of a small total energy , an frb outflow would reach the non - relativistic phase in a relatively short period of time . the transition time is when the bulk lorentz factor @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . after this transition time",
    ", the scaling law of the fs emission is modified as @xmath36 the non - relativistic phase transition time is roughly @xmath37 s for with @xmath38 erg , respectively .",
    "if a putative rs exists , the four parameters @xmath39 of the two shocks can be related to each other at @xmath9 , which depend on the ratios between the micro - physics parameters of the two shocks ( kobayashi & zhang 2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "2003 ) . when explicitly written , these four parameters are @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42",
    "@xmath43 notice that @xmath5 is normalized to 0.1 , in view that the outflow is likely magnetized .",
    "the scaling laws of rs before and after the crossing time are ( e.g. kobayashi 2000 ; yi et al .",
    "2013 ; gao et al .",
    "2013a ) @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "figure 1 shows the calculated fs frb afterglow lightcurves in the x - ray ( 2 kev , panel a ) , optical ( r - band , panel b ) , and radio ( 1 ghz , panel c ) bands , respectively .",
    "three different energies , i.e. @xmath46 erg ( blue ) , @xmath47 erg ( red ) , and @xmath48 erg ( green ) , and three different redshifts , i.e. @xmath49 ( dashed ) , 0.1 ( dash - dotted ) , and 0.01 ( solid ) , have been adopted .",
    "other parameters are fixed to the typical values : @xmath19 , @xmath50 , @xmath31 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the sensitivity lines of different detectors in different energy bands are also plotted . the black solid line in panel",
    "a is the sensitivity line of _ swift_/x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , which is @xmath53 early on , and breaks to @xmath54 when @xmath55 at @xmath56 s ( moretti et al .",
    "2009 , d. n. burrows , 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "the black solid line in panel b is the sensitivity line of the large synoptic survey telescope array ( lsst ) . in the survey mode",
    ", lsst reaches 24.5 mag in 30 seconds ( r. margutti , 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "the black solid line in panel c is the sensitivity line of the expanded very large array ( evla ) , which scales as @xmath54 for arbitrarily long exposure times .    in general , the broad - band frb afterglows are all very faint . only for a large @xmath1 and a small @xmath57 , when the predicted afterglow flux becomes of an observational interest .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the x - ray afterglow becomes detectable by _",
    "swift_/xrt only for the most optimistic case calculated , i.e. @xmath46 erg , and @xmath58 ( panel a ) .",
    "in the optical r - band ( panel b ) , the peak magnitude of the fs light curves are about 17 , 22 , 26 , respectively , for @xmath59 and @xmath46 erg .",
    "the lsst may catch the peak emission only when @xmath60 for @xmath46 erg . in the 1 ghz radio band ( panel c ) , the peak flux density are about @xmath61 jy , @xmath62 jy , and @xmath63 jy , respectively , for @xmath59 and @xmath46 erg .",
    "this would be detected by evla only when @xmath64 for @xmath46 erg .",
    "the peak time shifts to later times with dereasing frequency .",
    "this suggests that follow - up observations are easier in low frequencies .",
    "for example , with @xmath46 erg , the peak time in 1 ghz is around 1 day .",
    "we also consider the rs emission from frbs in figure 2 .",
    "fixing other parameters , we allow @xmath65 to be higher than @xmath66 in view that the outflow is likely highly magnetized . defining @xmath67 ( zhang et al .",
    "2003 ) , we calculate the cases for @xmath68 ( purple ) , @xmath69 ( blue ) , and @xmath70 ( red ) .",
    "we fix @xmath46 erg and consider @xmath58 and @xmath71 , with the fs emission ( green ) plotted as a reference .",
    "one can see that with a large @xmath72 , the rs component would outshine the fs component , especially in the optical and radio bands , making it easier to detect .",
    "the afterglow is detectable by lsst and evla at @xmath64 .    to better display how peak time and peak flux depend on @xmath1 and @xmath57 , in figure 3",
    "we show the contours of peak time and peak flux in the @xmath73 space .",
    "the three panels are for x - rays ( panel a ) , optical ( panel b ) and radio ( panel c ) , respectively .",
    "the x - ray peak time is simply the deceleration time @xmath9 . for the optical band , the peak time is defined when @xmath74 crosses the band . for the radio band , the peak time is defined when @xmath75 crosses the band . for the peak flux , we present two ( fs vs. rs ) values , with the rs value presented in the parenthesis ( noticing the same @xmath1- and @xmath57-dependences of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since the sensitivity of lsst in the survey mode is a constant ( 24.5 mag ) , we also plotted two thick lines ( 24.5 mag ) above which lsst can detect the fs ( magenta ) and rs ( green ) emissions , respectively .    assuming that most observed frbs are at @xmath78",
    ", one can derive the event rate for frbs below a certain redshift .",
    "assuming that the total event rate density is a constant , i.e. @xmath79 ( thornton et al .",
    "2013 ) , a smaller redshift corresponds to a small volume , and hence , a small event rate . taking an event rate of @xmath80 at @xmath81 ( thornton et al .",
    "2013 ) , one can draw the expected event rate as a function of @xmath57 based on volume correction .",
    "this is shown as blue dotted lines in the three contour plots .",
    "notice that the event rate is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "for example ,",
    "recently petroff et al ( 2014 ) reported a lack of frbs at intermediate galactic latitudes , which suggests either a possible anisotropy of frb distribution or a lower event rate .",
    "our event rate curve is still relevant as long as one re - normalize the @xmath82 event rate to whatever value determined by future observations .",
    "in this paper , we apply the standard grb afterglow model to predict possible afterglow emission from frbs . we calculate their afterglow lightcurves in x - rays , optical , and radio by assuming a range of their total kinetic energies and redshifts . in general , owing to their low energetics , the broad - band afterglow emission is predicted to be very faint , especially for the fs only .",
    "only if the total kinetic energy of frbs is very large ( radio efficiency very low ) , and in rare cases when some of them are close enough to earth , could their fs afterglows become ( barely ) detectable by the current instruments .",
    "it is unclear whether there is a bright rs component from frbs . if so ( which requires significant de - magnetization before deceleration ) , the chance of detecting frb afterglow in the optical and radio bands is higher , even though still challenging .",
    "since data analyses needed to claim the detection of an frb take significant time , and since the x - ray afterglow of an frb peaks early and decays rapidly , follow up observations of frbs with x - ray telescopes ( e.g. swift / xrt ) would not be fruitful .",
    "a better strategy to detect an x - ray counterpart of an frb is to apply a wide - field x - ray telescope ( such as einstein probe and lobster ) , which may catch an x - ray transient associated with an frb .",
    "however , such a telescope is still being proposed , and it is believed that several other types x - ray transients , e.g. supernova shock breakouts ( soderberg et al . 2008 ) , jets from tidal disruption events ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ; bloom et al . 2011 ) , and putative x - ray transients due to neutron star - neutron star mergers with a millisecond magnetar engine ( zhang 2013 ; gao et al . 2013b",
    "; yu et al . 2013 ; metzger & piro 2014 ) , would give rise to brighter x - ray signals than the frb afterglow .",
    "detecting x - ray transients associated with frbs is plausible , but challenging .    in the optical band ,",
    "the fs peak time is after @xmath9 , while the rs peak time is at @xmath9 .",
    "again due to the possible delay of data analysis to claim an frb discovery , follow - up observations may not be fruitful .",
    "one should also appeal to wide - field optical telescopes , such as gwac ( paul et al .",
    "the peak flux is however usually too low to be detected by these telescopes , unless the source is energetic , nearby , and with a bright rs emission component .",
    "the optical afterglow peak emission can be detected by lsst for nearby energetic events in the survey mode . however , since only 7 - 10 square degrees are covered in each 30 seconds exposure ( e. berger , 2014 , private communication ) , it still takes great chance coincidence to detect the optical afterglow of an frb with lsst .    in the radio band , the telescope that detects",
    "the frb can continue to collect data . as a result",
    ", no trigger information is needed to `` follow - up '' an frb . on the other hand ,",
    "the afterglow is faint . for a jy - level frb ,",
    "the peak afterglow flux is in the @xmath83jy level for the fs component for typical parameters , and at most one order of magnitude brighter for the rs component . for optimistic cases ( large @xmath1 and small @xmath57 ) ,",
    "the afterglow flux may reach the mjy level , but the detection rate for these extreme cases is very low . in general , large radio telescopes with high sensitivity is needed . in principle , one can use a small radio telescope to trigger an frb and use a large telescope to follow up .",
    "the peak time of radio afterglow is @xmath84 s ( hours to days ) .",
    "this would be a good strategy if the data processing time to claim an frb detection can be reduced to within hours .",
    "follow up observations with evla would be able to catch the frb afterglow if the source is energetic and nearby .",
    "the afterglow emission signal discussed in this paper is _ generic _ to progenitor models .",
    "it is also the _ minimum _ multi - wavelength signals one would expect to be associated with an frb .",
    "subject to progenitor models , an frb may be accompanied by other brighter signals ( e.g. kashiyama et al .",
    "2013 ; zhang 2014 ; niino et al .",
    "2014 ) , which can be used to differentiate among the progenitor models ."
