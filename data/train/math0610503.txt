    "let us divide @xmath44 into four areas .",
    "recall that in our construction , we smoothen 2 corners of the generating curve .",
    "therefore when we revolve it : there is a curved cap at the tip ( the cap ) , a thin curved belt around the great parallel ( the belt ) , a flat disc at the bottom ( the disc ) and the long cone ( the cone ) [ figure 2 ] .",

    "we can assume @xmath93 . to make the following arguments simpler",

    "therefore @xmath81 is similar to the great parallel : any two points @xmath66 dividing @xmath81 into halves can be joined by a path of length @xmath100 .",
    "this is a shorter path .",
    "therefore we conclude that all geodesics in this case are not @xmath23 . + * case b ) * now , since @xmath81 connects the great parallel and some point in the cap , @xmath81 has at least length of ( @xmath101 ) for some small @xmath102 .",

    "[ pic3 ]    we need the following lemma : +    @xmath105 is monotonic increasing in @xmath104 for all geodesics in case c.    * proof * : consider the universal cover of the cone .",

    "a fundamental domain is a sector [ figure 4 ] .",
    "+    [ pic4 ]    now this is a development of the cone area , any geodesic segment is a straight line .",
    "also , @xmath104 is given by the angle of intersection with the outer circle .",
    "it is now easy to see that @xmath105 is monotonic increasing in @xmath104 : since we assume that @xmath91 has length 1 , @xmath105 is the length of the arc corresponding to the chord given by @xmath81 [ figure 5 ] .",
    "@xmath49 +    [ pic5 ]    finally , we claim that for any fix @xmath107 .",
    "when @xmath42 is large enough , any @xmath81 not contained in the @xmath108-neighborhood of the great parallel has self - intersection . to see this ,",

    "take @xmath115 , this is a similar case as the geodesics that is contained in the curved belt : any two points @xmath66 dividing @xmath81 into halves can be joined by a shorter path through the disc .",
