    "muon capture by complex nuclei has been used in the study of both the dynamics of the weak interaction and the structure of the atomic nucleus .",
    "generally , in exclusive capture between discrete states one attempts to separate the effects of dynamics and structure by suitable choice of physical observables and spin - parity sequences .",
    "of course in practice these dual aspects of muon capture are not completely separable , and inevitably such studies must confront the entanglement of dynamics and structure .    of special interest in muon capture is the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant @xmath10 of the nucleon s weak axial current @xmath11 . its value is firmly predicted by chiral symmetry @xcite thus making its measurement an important test of low energy qcd .",
    "moreover , in complex nuclei its medium modification  due to effects that range from core polarization and exchange currents to partial restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite  are of considerable interest .",
    "unfortunately , the world data on @xmath10 from exclusive capture on complex nuclei is rather sparse , it comprising the study of recoil orientations in allowed gamow - teller transitions on @xmath12c @xcite and @xmath13si @xcite , the study of hyperfine effects in allowed gamow - teller transitions on @xmath14b @xcite and @xmath15na @xcite , and the measurement of the @xmath16o@xmath17n@xmath18 first - forbidden transition rate @xcite . while the majority of these experiments are in agreement with the chiral prediction for the induced coupling , the result of @xmath19 @xcite from the @xmath13si experiments is in stark disagreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "it is perhaps surprising  given that fifty years have passed since the birth of @xmath20-@xmath21 theory  that few measurements of recoil orientations in muon capture have actually been performed .",
    "partly motivated by the puzzling result for the recoil orientation in the @xmath13si@xmath22al@xmath23 experiment , we therefore decided a further investigation of recoil orientations in exclusive capture was worthwhile .",
    "the case we chose was @xmath6n@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath6c@xmath5 , it presenting an interesting example of the different sensitivities of the different observables to the weak dynamics and the nuclear structure .    herein we report the measurement of the recoil alignment in the transition @xmath6n@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath6c@xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ s : method ] we briefly outline the measurement technique and experimental setup . the determination of the recoil alignment from the doppler broadened spectrum of the 7012  kev gamma - rays is described in detail in sec .",
    "[ s : alignment ] . in sec .",
    "[ s : interpretation ] we compare our experimental result to model calculations , and discuss the sensitivity to the induced pseudoscalar coupling @xmath10 , second - forbidden contributions , and @xmath24 nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "note that gamma - ray intensities from this @xmath25@xmath6n experiment were published earlier in stocki _",
    "et al . _",
    "the products of exclusive muon capture are a left - handed muon neutrino and an orientated recoil nucleus .",
    "the recoil orientation is a direct manifestation of the @xmath20-@xmath21 character of the weak interaction , and for certain spin - parity sequences the induced coupling @xmath10 has a large effect on the recoil orientation .",
    "moreover , in appropriate cases the recoil orientation can be experimentally determined from the directional correlation that is imparted on either the beta - rays or the gamma - rays that are subsequently emitted by the unstable recoil .    a method for measuring the @xmath26recoil directional correlation",
    "was originally proposed by grenacs _",
    "et al . _",
    "the method takes advantage of the doppler shift of the @xmath26ray energy for a decay in  flight .",
    "if the recoil is in motion as it decays its energy is shifted by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath26ray energy in the recoil reference frame , @xmath29 is the @xmath26ray energy in the laboratory reference frame , @xmath30 is the velocity of the recoil in the laboratory , and @xmath31 is the angle between the @xmath26ray momentum vector and the recoil momentum vector .",
    "consequently the lineshape of the doppler broadened @xmath26-ray is a reflection of the @xmath26recoil angular correlation . in suitable cases ,",
    "_ i.e._where the @xmath26-ray lifetime is short and the spin - parity sequence is sensitive , this method thus permits the determination of the recoil orientation in the capture process .    in this work",
    "we have studied the sequence @xmath6n@xmath32 @xmath3 @xmath6c@xmath5 @xmath3 @xmath6c@xmath7 .",
    "because the lifetime of the 7012  kev state is rather short , @xmath33  fs @xcite , and the slowing - down time of the @xmath6c recoil in a liquid n@xmath34 target is rather long , @xmath350.8  ps @xcite , the @xmath26-ray spectrum is doppler broadened .",
    "the resulting @xmath26-recoil angular distribution is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the legendre polynomial , @xmath0 is the recoil s longitudinal alignment and @xmath38 is the @xmath26-decay correlation coefficient .",
    "we omit the negligible effects of rank-4 correlations and assume either unpolarized muonic atoms or perpendicular geometry ( see appendix [ a : correlation ] and ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . ]",
    "note that the longitudinal alignment @xmath0 is a direct manifestation of the different populations of the magnetic sub - states about the recoil direction , and is entirely governed by the capture process .",
    "conversely the @xmath26-decay coefficient @xmath38 is a function of the @xmath26-decay . for a @xmath39 transition and a rank-2 orientation",
    "its value is @xmath40 @xcite . for further details",
    "see appendix [ a : correlation ] .",
    "a detailed discussion of the experimental setup was presented in stocki _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite  herein we review the features that are important for the determination of the recoil alignment @xmath0 in the @xmath6n@xmath41c@xmath5 transition .",
    "the experiment was conducted on the m9b superconducting muon channel at the triumf cyclotron .",
    "the negative muon beam had a momentum of 65  mev / c and a flux of @xmath42s@xmath43 , with an electron contamination of @xmath3520% and a pion contamination of @xmath440.2% .",
    "the incoming particles were detected in a three - element plastic scintillator beam telescope and stopped in a liquid nitrogen target .",
    "the target was @xmath45  cm in cross section and @xmath46  cm in thickness with walls of polystyrene .",
    "mu - metal was used to reduce the ambient magnetic field and thereby the muon spin precession .",
    "the outgoing @xmath26-rays were detected at right - angles to the beam axis in a high - purity ge detector with a compton suppressor .",
    "the ge detector had an efficiency of 44% , an in - beam energy resolution of 2.5  kev , and an in - beam time resolution of 6  ns , for the 1.33  mev @xmath26-ray line of a co-@xmath47 source .",
    "the compton suppressor comprised a six - element annulus of nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "a remark is warranted on the hyperfine effect in the @xmath25@xmath6n atom . on formation",
    "the 1s ground state of the @xmath25@xmath6n atom is a statistical mix of the two hyperfine states , _",
    "i.e. _ one third @xmath48 and two thirds @xmath49 .",
    "hyperfine transitions , from the higher - lying @xmath50 state to the lower - lying @xmath51 state , would modify these proportions , and consequently the various observables in muon capture .",
    "such transitions in @xmath52-atoms are mediated by the m1 emission of an auger electron from the surrounding electronic orbits @xcite . for @xmath25@xmath6n , where the muonic atom hyperfine splitting is 7.4",
    "ev and outer - most electron binding energy is 11.3  ev , one expects such transitions to be energetically forbidden @xcite .",
    "we note the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have suggested the possibility of a non - zero hyperfine transition rate via an unconventional transition mechanism in the @xmath25@xmath6n atom .",
    "however , in absence of confirmation in recent studies by stocki _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we will hereafter assume that the capture originates from a statistical mixture of the hyperfine states , _",
    "i.e. _ the measured recoil alignment is the statistical recoil alignment @xmath53 .",
    "finally we note the proximity of the interesting 7012  kev level to the @xmath6c neutron separation energy .",
    "this allays the concern over cascade feeding to the 7012  kev level from muon capture to a higher - lying level .",
    "the resulting spectrum in the energy region of the 7012  kev @xmath26-ray is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the @xmath26-ray events in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] were recorded within a @xmath54  @xmath52s time window of a muon arrival and in absence of any signal in the compton suppressor .",
    "the first step in the analysis was the determination of the energy calibration and the instrumental resolution of the ge detector .",
    "the energy calibration was obtained from eight well - known and clean @xmath26-ray lines from thermal neutron capture on al , fe and cl with energies that ranged from 6.2  mev to 7.8  mev @xcite . in fitting the peaks we found a simple gaussian lineshape with energy - independent width to be sufficient .",
    "a linear relation between channel number and @xmath26-ray energy was also adequate for the calibration in the energy range @xmath55-@xmath56  mev .",
    "next we performed the least - squares fit to the doppler lineshape of the 7012  kev @xmath26-ray .",
    "the fit function involved the convolution of the theoretical lineshape ( eqn .",
    "[ e : correlation ] ) with the instrumental resolution of the ge detector and the slowing - down effects in the target material . to compute the slowing - down time @xmath57 of the @xmath6c",
    "recoil ion in the liquid @xmath58 target we used the computer program srim @xcite .",
    "we note that the slowing - down time @xmath59  ps is much longer than the gamma - ray lifetime @xmath60  fs , and consequently in incorporating the slowing - down effects into the doppler lineshape we assumed a simple linear form @xmath61 for the recoil velocity time dependence .    the energy spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also indicates the presence of a weak background line on the far lefthand side of the doppler spectrum .",
    "we identified this peak as a 6978  kev gamma - ray originating from thermal neutron capture on chlorine-35 .",
    "this identification was based on both its energy correspondence and reasonable consistency with observed intensities of other stronger @xmath62cl@xmath63 lines .",
    "the @xmath62cl@xmath64 background was believed to originate from polyvinyl chloride tape in the vicinity of the target .",
    "consequently , both a doppler peak and a gaussian peak were needed to fit the region of the 7012  kev peak .",
    "the fit function involved a total of eleven adjustable parameters .",
    "they comprised the amplitudes ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , centroids ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and instrumental widths ( @xmath69 ) of the doppler peak and the gaussian peak , the initial velocity ( @xmath70 ) , slowing - down time ( @xmath57 ) and longitudinal alignment ( @xmath53 ) of the @xmath6c recoil , and the amplitude and the slope of the continuum background .",
    "fortunately , a number of parameters could be fixed in the fit , for example the instrumental widths and peak centroids from the energy calibration , the initial velocity from the reaction kinematics , and the recoil slowing - down time from the srim calculation .",
    "also the amplitude of the 6978  kev @xmath62cl@xmath64 line could be estimated from the amplitudes of the other @xmath62cl@xmath64 lines and the available thermal neutron capture data @xcite .",
    "our benchmark fit , which clearly demonstrates the good agreement between the measured spectrum and the theoretical function , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this fit",
    "the instrumental width ( @xmath69 ) , initial velocity ( @xmath70 ) and slowing - down time ( @xmath57 ) were all fixed at their calculated values .",
    "the fit gave @xmath71 with a chi - squared @xmath72 .",
    "to investigate the correlations between the recoil alignment and the other parameters we performed a series of fits , the results of which are summarized in table [ t : fits ] .",
    "the table shows that the `` best - fit '' value of the recoil alignment is only weakly dependent on the parameters related to the energy calibration and the instrumental resolution ( rows 1 - 4 of table [ t : fits ] ) .",
    "in addition it shows that large changes in the input value of the slowing - down time , which ranged from @xmath73  ps to @xmath74 , had very little effect on the `` best - fit '' value of the recoil alignment ( rows 5 - 6 of table [ t : fits ] ) .",
    "moreover , the choice of either a flat continuum background or a linear continuum background and the left - right margins of the fit region , had only minor effects on the `` best - fit '' value of the recoil alignment .",
    "by contrast the presence of the 6978  kev background line had a significant impact on the least - squares - fit to the recoil alignment .",
    "the importance of including the 6978  kev line is demonstrated by comparing the results of fits performed with the 6978  kev peak included , which yielded @xmath75 ( row 1 ) , and the 6978  kev peak omitted , which yielded @xmath76 ( row 8) .",
    "in addition , we found a significant difference in `` best fit '' values of @xmath77 when comparing the cases of either ( i ) varying the 6978  kev line amplitude or ( ii ) fixing the 6978  kev line amplitude . in order to fix the amplitude of the 6978  kev @xmath62cl@xmath63 line we used the amplitudes of the nearby 6678  kev and 7414  kev @xmath62cl@xmath78 lines and their relative intensities taken from krusche _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the free - amplitude fit gave a recoil alignment @xmath79 with a 6978  kev peak amplitude @xmath80 ( row 1 ) . by comparison the fixed - amplitude fit gave @xmath81 with @xmath82 ( row 9 ) , _ i.e. _ showing a difference of @xmath351  @xmath69 for the recoil alignment and a discrepancy of @xmath351.6@xmath83 for the peak amplitude .",
    "the 1.6  @xmath69 discrepancy between the estimated amplitude and the fitted amplitude of the 6978  kev line may reflect the statistics of the 6978  kev background line , the presence of an unidentified background line , or the uncertainties in interpolating @xmath62cl@xmath84 intensities .",
    "we consider the result of the free - amplitude fit to be most trustworthy .    in conclusion , by fitting the 7012  kev lineshape we obtained the recoil alignment @xmath71 , which indicates the @xmath6c@xmath85 recoil is highly orientated following muon capture .",
    "we found the alignment determination was relatively insensitive to the parameters related to the energy calibration , instrumental resolution , and slowing - down effects , but more sensitive to the presence of the 6978  kev @xmath62cl@xmath84 background line .",
    "the mass-@xmath86 system includes a well - known example of a highly suppressed allowed gamow - teller transition ; the @xmath70-decay that connects the @xmath6c@xmath87 ground state and @xmath6n@xmath88 ground state . in lieu of g.s .- to - g.s .",
    "gamow - teller strength the @xmath6n@xmath3@xmath6c gt strength is distributed across a few low - lying @xmath6c excited states , with most notable the @xmath89 doublet at @xmath90 and @xmath91  kev @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath89 doublet wavefunctions involve both @xmath92 components _ and _ @xmath93 components @xcite , with configuration mixing being indispensable to understanding the partitioning of the gt strength within the @xmath89 doublet .",

    "as alluded to above , this discrepancy is understood as a result of the importance of the @xmath93 components in the @xmath96 wavefunction , such configurations decreasing the wavefunction overlap between the @xmath6n initial state and the @xmath6c final state .",

    "the relatively small model dependence for the alignment may be contrasted with the relatively large model dependence of the capture rate , it decreasing by roughly a factor of five from ckpot to mk3cw3 ( see table [ t : rates ] ) . to better understand this striking difference in model sensitivities between @xmath77 and @xmath113 we remind the reader the alignment is governed by ratios of nuclear matrix elements and weak coupling constants .",
    "therefore , as both the numerator and denominator in @xmath77 are dominated by @xmath143 , the recoil alignment @xmath77 is rather weakly model dependent although the matrix element @xmath143 itself is rather strongly model dependent . the residual model dependence of the recoil alignment @xmath77 may be ultimately traced to the small contributions of the @xmath108-@xmath109 one - body transitions densities to the @xmath6n@xmath32 @xmath3 @xmath6c@xmath5 transition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the relative contributions of the different matrix elements to the recoil alignment @xmath53 .",

    "the effects of other @xmath183 matrix elements are small and the effects of the @xmath184 matrix elements are negligible .",
    "consequently , the dominant source of model dependences in computing @xmath53 is the knowledge of the ratio between the @xmath182 gt matrix elements and the @xmath143 matrix element .",
    "this ratio is sensitive to the @xmath105 wavefunction admixture through the @xmath108-@xmath109 one - body transition densities .",
    "our alignment measurement , @xmath185 , and alignment calculation , @xmath186@xmath187 , are clearly in reasonable agreement .",
    "indeed the comparison between model and data is sufficient to constrain the coupling s value to @xmath188 ( ckpot ) to @xmath189 ( mk3cw3 ) .",

    "its helpful to summarize the terms that contribute to @xmath77 ( for definiteness we employ the mk3cw3 model ) . in the limit of ( i )",
    "no forbidden nuclear matrix elements and ( ii ) no induced pseudoscalar coupling , the recoil alignment is @xmath193 .",
    "the contribution of the coupling @xmath194 increases the recoil alignment to @xmath195 and the contribution of @xmath196 gt terms increase the recoil alignment to @xmath197 .",
    "finally the remaining nuclear matrix elements , mostly the axial charge matrix element , are responsible for increasing the value to @xmath198 . clearly the agreement of model and data for @xmath77 lend support to significant contributions from both the induced pseudoscalar coupling and the @xmath182 forbidden corrections .",
    "in summary , we report a measurement of the longitudinal alignment @xmath77 of the recoil nucleus in the @xmath6n@xmath41c@xmath5 transition . the alignment was determined from the doppler lineshape of the 7012  kev gamma - ray from the @xmath6c@xmath199c@xmath7 transition , _",

    "the calculations were conducted in both a simple @xmath200 model space and a richer @xmath201 model space . as discussed by others ,",
    "the capture rate @xmath113 is dominated by the @xmath202 gamow - teller matrix element and the weak axial coupling @xmath156 , and is highly sensitive to the @xmath93 admixture in the @xmath12c@xmath203 wavefunction . by comparison",

    "this bound is consistent with the value @xmath204 obtained from the determination of the @xmath12c@xmath205b@xmath2 transition recoil polarization , but inconsistent with the value @xmath206 obtained from the determination of the @xmath13si@xmath207al@xmath208 recoil alignment .",
    "our result is consistent with @xmath179  the theoretical prediction derived from chiral symmetry arguments .",
    "our experiment was limited by both the statistical accuracy of the doppler lineshape and the unfortunate presence of the @xmath62cl@xmath64 6978  kev background line .",
    "the model uncertainties are apparently dominated by the uncertainties in the @xmath196 gamow - teller matrix elements arising from the uncertainties in the @xmath93 wavefunction admixture .",
    "we suggest , with better statistics and reduced backgrounds , the @xmath6n@xmath32 @xmath3 @xmath6c@xmath5 transition would offer a competitive window on induced currents and forbidden contributions in muon capture .",
