    "recently ( see @xcite , @xcite and , for a review , @xcite ) , in order to realize in practise a quantum dirac field theory on curved spacetimes , there has been interest in exploiting certain special features of the low - energy physics of the @xmath0-bonds electrons of graphene , weyl symmetry @xcite being among them @xcite .",
    "the clearest signature of quantum field theory ( qft ) on curved spacetime is the hawking effect @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the best conditions for the simplest realization of the latter on graphene were proposed .",
    "on one side , we have graphene , a one - atom - thick membrane of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice , see fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] , first discussed theoretically in @xcite , then found experimentally in @xcite .",

    "the continuum field approximation is tenable . ]    on the other side we have qft in curved spacetime .",
    "this is by now an old theory @xcite , with no ultimate experimental evidence , hence with many open problems , and interesting issues to investigate in relation to the practical implementation of a fundamental theory .",
    "the open questions range from the structure of the quantum vacuum , and the related role of the inequivalent quantizations ( think , for instance , to the _ querelle _ between the young and the old hawking , about the information loss in the presence of a black hole ) , to the very meaning of particles in a curved spacetime .",
    "there are then open questions relative to the hawking phenomenon itself , predicted but to - date impossible to detect from astrophysical sources , and the associated black - hole thermodynamics .",
    "these questions , although old , are all still on the table and permeate the contemporary research on high energy theory , as , for instance , one direction pursued these days is to see gravity , and the spacetime itself , as an emergent phenomenon .",
    "graphene appears to be a system where many of the issues above could be experimentally addressed . in the following ,",
    "i will propose arguments and experiments in favor of this .",
    "the preliminary step to start the merging is to consider the dimensionality of the problem , that is ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "i will take this duly into account .",
    "for instance , it is by now well known that many features of ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions need to be changed on the gravity side @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that a black - hole is possible @xcite , and that certain features , on the matter side , such as the `` statistical swapping '' @xcite , can take place .",
    "@xmath17 the @xmath18 step is to take time on board , hence we move from the hamiltonian ( [ hgraphene ] ) to the corresponding action a = i v_f d^3 x | ^a _ a , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and , since we do not consider phenomena mixing the two fermi points , we focus on one point only , e.g. , @xmath23 . when the graphene sheet is curved , and within certain limits @xcite , the action to consider is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the gauge field able to take into account intrinsic curvature . here @xmath27 is the spin connection , and @xmath28 are the generators of local lorentz transformations , with @xmath29 responding to diffeomorphisms , and @xmath30 flat indices . within the limits indicated in @xcite and @xcite ( essentially , in the absence of torsion and of strong scatters @xcite , and for small curvatures , i.e. large radius of curvature w.r.t .",
    "the lattice , @xmath31 ) , this action well describes the physics of the very long wavelength @xmath0 electrons on curved graphene sheets .",
    "the only effects it needs to take care of are the ones induced by intrinsic curvature , i.e. , _ inelastic _ effects that we ascribe to disclination defects @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 the @xmath32 step is to exploit the absence of mass in the action ( [ gigino ] ) , that , in the case in point of the dirac field , guarantees full local weyl symmetry @xcite . in the case of conformally flat metrics ,",
    "@xmath33 , weyl symmetry gives i d^3 x | ^_= i d^3 x | ^a _ a  where , under weyl s transformations , @xmath34 .",
    "namely , the flat space theory is classically equal to a curved space theory .",
    "we have to consider quantum effects , though",
    ". as we are in a odd - dimensional spacetime , this does not refer to quantum trace anomalies , absent here @xcite .",
    "what we refer to here ( see @xcite ) is that one can , essentially , do two type of things : ( a ) perform measurements in a frame where the quantum effects of curvature disappear , e.g. , s ( x_1 , x_2 ) 0| ( x_1 ) | ( x_2 ) |0 = 0|  ( x_1 ) | ( x_2 ) |0  = s  ( x_1 , x_2 ) , where @xmath35 is the two - point function in the curved case , and @xmath36 is the two - point function in the flat case ; or",
    "( b ) perform the measurements in a frame where , due to weyl symmetry , the effects are seen as a simple modification of the flat case ( conformal triviality @xcite ) [ green ] s ( x_1 , x_2 ) 0| ( x_1 ) | ( x_2 ) |0  = ^-1 ( x_1 ) ^-1 ( x_2 ) s ",
    "( x_1 , x_2 ) . in our case , due to the obvious difficulty to realize a frame where the measuring apparatus is in a gravitating field whose spacetime coincides with the graphene curved spacetime , the second choice will be the right one .",
    "@xmath17 the @xmath37 step is to stick to a metric that is the most easy to realize in a lab , namely g^(2 + 1 ) _ ( x , y ) = (    cc 1 & + & g^(2 ) _ ( x , y )    ) , i.e. , with all the curvature in the spatial part @xmath38 , and no time - dependence .",
    "can this be conformally flat , rich and still interesting ? to answer all these questions we need to solve @xcite c",
    "_ = _ ^^ _ + _ ^^_= 0 .",
    "since all surfaces of constant gaussian curvature @xmath39 solve this equation @xcite , they give rise to conformally flat ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes @xmath40 .",
    "hence the answer to the above questions is yes : by simply curving the graphene sheet one can have rich enough situations ( surfaces of constant @xmath41 ) implying a conformally flat spacetime .    @xmath17 the @xmath42 step .",
    "the latter result is intrinsic , but to implement weyl symmetry we need the explicit conformal factor , and this might mean to change the frame q^(t , x , y ) ^(t , x , y ) so that g^(2 + 1 ) _ ( q )",
    "= ^2 ( q ) g^flat _ ( q ) .",
    "this can be technically difficult ( a system of 6 partial differential equations ) , but the most important here are the physical meaning , global predictability , and practical feasibility of this coordinate frame .",
    "the surfaces of @xmath43= const .",
    "can be described by the spatial line element @xcite d^2 = du^2 + c^2 ^2 ( u / r ) dv^2 where @xmath44 is meridian coordinate , and @xmath45 the parallel coordinate , and with the real constant @xmath46 such that @xmath47 ( sphere ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "these @xmath50 are difficult to find .",
    "interesting objects , like , e.g. , the black - hole of @xcite , are related to spacetimes of negative constant curvature . for the surfaces of @xmath51= const .",
    "the following theorem by hilbert holds : _ no non - singular surface of constant @xmath51 can be embedded in @xmath52_. if we can live ( and we can ) with singularities , such surfaces are many more than the positive curvature counterparts ( there are , actually , an infinite number of them ) . among them there are the surfaces of revolution , called pseudospheres , and they can be described by the spatial line element @xcite [ pseudospheres ] d^2 = du^2 + ( c_1 ^ 2 ^2 ( u / r ) + c_2 ^ 2 ^2 ( u / r ) ) dv^2 with @xmath53 .",
    "for all these surfaces ( and also for those not included in the above line element ) [ graphenemetric ] ds^2_graphene = dt^2-(dx^2+dy^2 ) = with @xmath54 the abstract coordinates of upper - half plane model of the lobachevsky geometry ( see @xcite for the case in point of graphene , and @xcite for a general introduction to the subject ) . to make sense in a laboratory , these coordinates need to be expressed in terms of measurable coordinates , say the @xmath55 coordinates above , and this amounts to choose the surface .",
    "the line element in square bracket is flat , but this is not yet the solution of our problem , because we need to see , case by case , to which physical @xmath50 the coordinates @xmath56 correspond to .    as a counter - example , consider the case of the hyperbolic pseudosphere ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 in ( [ pseudospheres ] ) ) = e^c v / r ( u / r ) , = e^c v / r / ( u / r ) .",
    "since the conformal factor @xmath59 in ( [ graphenemetric ] ) is multivalued ( @xmath45 is an angle ) , this solution as no global predictability in @xmath60 , hence one must look for a different frame where this does not happen , but the frame in point might be difficult to realize in practise ( and surely it is not the lab frame @xmath61 , where all that needs to be done is to curve the surface ) .",
    "it is the beltrami pseudosphere ( see fig .  [ beltrami ] ) that solves the problem = v / r , = e^-u / r / r i.e. @xmath62 makes sense over the whole surface / spacetime .",
    "hence , the physical @xmath50 are the lab s @xmath61 .",
    "a physically doable @xmath63 is already there in the frame @xmath61 : ds^2_graphene ds_(b)^2 = e^2u / r .",
    "now we can say that the line element in square brackets is the rindler line element , @xmath64 , and exploit this fact in our quest for measurable effects of the qft in curved space interpretation of the physics of graphene @xmath0 electrons .",
    "@xmath17 the @xmath65 step consists in implementing the unruh requests on this setting . in particular it is important the choice of the quantum vacuum of reference , taken here to be the minkowski vacuum @xmath66 , thus the green s function of interest are of the form ( see ( [ green ] ) and @xcite ) [ green2 ] s^b ( x_1 , x_2 ) 0_m | ^b ( x_1 ) |^b ( x_2 )    @xmath67 stands for `` beltrami '' , @xmath68 for  rindler  , and the green s function on the right side is @xmath69 , the customary two - point function used in the computation of the unruh effect .",
    "the power spectrum is customarily computed by taking @xmath69 at the same point in space , @xmath70 , and at two different times , with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the proper time ( the factor @xmath73 is related here to the proper acceleration , and needs be constant , to fit the requests for the standard unruh effect ) . from this , by fourier transforming on the time variable , we get @xcite f^r ( , ) , and it coincides here with the ( not yet physical ) electronic local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite ^r ( , ) f^r ( , ) . as this is a massless case ,",
    "the result of the computation is exact f^(r)()= where @xmath74 .",
    "we are now in the position to make a verifiable prediction , by going back to the physical spacetime . due to the weyl symmetry , this is easy ( see ( [ green2 ] ) ) ^b ( , ) = ^-2 ( ) ^r ( , ) .",
    "thus , the ldos predicted for a graphene sheet shaped as a beltrami pseudosphere is @xcite [ theformula ] ^b(e , u , r)= , i.e. , a hawking phenomenon with hawking temperature _ 0 . in fig .",
    "[ linecut ] a plot of what we expect from a dedicated experiment with a scanning tunneling microscope @xcite .",
    "lately , i have been interacting with experimentalists from the manoharan lab of stanford university@xcite , who asked whether it is possible to see effects , of the kind described above , on their `` molecular graphene '' @xcite , that is a planar hexagonal lattice of carbon monoxide , co , molecules that mimics graphene .",
    "unfortunately , there were severe limitations in their experimental settings .",
    "the first is the flat setting , the second is the small number of points , the third is that molecular graphene is a simulator of the real thing that , although a very good one to test certain properties , it has basic parameters ( e.g. , the neighbor - to - neighbor distance , @xmath75 ) that make our task more difficult .    to write things in a list , what i had to address are the following issues :    1 .   how to tile a beltrami pseudosphere ? 2",
    "would a `` planar development '' ( the result of mapping the surface on a plane , hence with curvature traded for strain ) , still captures the features necessary for the hawking - unruh phenomenon to happen ? which one , among",
    "the infinitely many , is the best ?",
    "3 .   is the effect still there for a _ generic surface _ of negative constant @xmath39 ?",
    "4 .   ... can we solve issues ( i ) and ( ii ) for the given surface ?",
    "can we spot any hawking - unruh in a planar configuration of molecular graphene , that mimics the planar development of a _ portion _ of a generic graphene surface of ( not even necessarily constant ) negative @xmath39 ?",
    "my conclusions for the last point ( the best meeting point between manoharan lab s and this model s needs ) , are negative , as i will explain below .",
    "this analysis gave extra arguments in favor of a dedicated experiment , with a beltrami pseudosphere , as the best way to test this model .",
    "nonetheless , the attempt was worth the effort .",
    "first , i learned that point ( iii ) has a positive solution .",
    "thus , the realization of a generic graphene surface of constant negative gaussian curvature , although not being the best possible setting , should be enough to test a modified formula ( [ theformula ] ) , at least in an approximate way .",
    "on this i will briefly comment below , and will write in detail elsewhere .",
    "second , for whatever dedicated experiment one would like to carry on , matters like the issue ( i ) in the list are crucial . in the following",
    ", i will address in detail this latter issue , and will also briefly comment about the other issues .",
    "therefore , let me focus on the geometric and topological constraints on building a beltrami pseudosphere with the hexagonal graphene membrane .",
    "there are two issues here .",
    "the first is the infinite ( non - compact ) surface ( @xmath76 $ ] ) .",
    "the second is how many heptagonal defects are necessary .",
    "let me introduce , briefly , the matter by recalling how to tile a compact surface @xmath77 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "suppose we want to tile @xmath77 with regular @xmath78-sided polygons assembled in such a way that each vertex is shared by 3 polygons , and each edge is shared by 2 polygons .",
    "if @xmath79 is the number of polygons used ( there are , say , @xmath80 pentagons , @xmath81 hexagons , @xmath82 heptagons , etc . ) to tile @xmath77 , the resulting _ polyhedron _ @xmath83 has @xmath84 vertices , @xmath85 edges , and @xmath86 faces , giving for the euler characteristic [ euler ] ( ) = v_p - e_p + f_p , the following expression @xmath87 for the sphere , the gauss - bonnet theorem@xcite , that links the topological number , @xmath88 , to the geometric object that is total curvature , gives k_tot d^2= 2 [ gbsimple ] , and , being @xmath89  constant = , [ gbsimpleconstgauss ] or , being area  @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 . hence ,",
    "if we try to wrap the hexagonal lattice of graphene , to form a tiling of the sphere , we can not match @xmath92 , only with hexagons ( whose number is not constrained by this argument ) , but need something else .",
    "considering that the creation of each defect costs energy , the minimum number of defects we need are 12 pentagons , @xmath93 , with which we could make the smallest ( and `` minimum energy '' ) tiling of the sphere , the dodecahedron ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) . adding @xmath97 hexagons to it , one makes a buckyball ( fullerene ) .",
    "one can increase @xmath81 further ( according to the rule @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , and excluding @xmath100 ) , making `` inflated '' buckyballs .",
    "once we trade the continuous sphere for its tiling polyhedron , the curvature resides in the vertices . for the sake of simplicity , let us focus on the icosahedron , dual ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 the same ) to the dodecahedron , so that @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the curvature associated to each pentagon is then [ curvpent ] k_5 = + /3 , while no curvature is associated to the hexagons , @xmath105 .",
    "of course , the same results can be obtained using the dodecahedron , although the argument becomes more involved .",
    "a direct way to obtain this result is with the _ defect / excess angle _ argument .",
    "the curvature at one vertex of the polyhedron is [ defeccangle ] k_v",
    "2- _ i _ i , where @xmath106 is the angle between edges of each face at the vertex . for a pentagon ( formed with equilateral triangles in the icosahedron ) ,",
    "@xmath107 , and @xmath108 , hence , @xmath109 ( defect angle ) .",
    "the same argument , for an hexagon gives @xmath110 .",
    "notice that the radius of curvature , @xmath111 , does not enter these formulae , hence the curvature associated to each defect is fixed . if we want to increase the curvature of the sphere ( make @xmath111 smaller )",
    ", we do not have to increase the _ number _ of defects , but their _ density _",
    "( i.e. , we have to decrease the number of hexagons ) .    from the elastic point of view",
    ", it has been shown that , for the sphere , the creation of _ heptagonal _ defects is energetically favored in certain conditions @xcite , but this does not violate the euler - poincar result ( [ euler ] ) , provided they come in pairs with pentagonal defects , @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and that is indeed the case ( scars @xcite ) .",
    "the same argument descending from the gauss - bonnet theorem ( [ gbsimple ] ) ( and the excess angle argument of ( [ defeccangle ] ) ) gives [ curvhept ] k_7 = - /3 , as the curvature associated to each one of these defects .",
    "thus , when we want to build ( tiling of ) surfaces of negative @xmath39 we need heptagonal defects .    if we want to wrap the graphene membrane into a beltrami pseudosphere , we first need to consider that the issue of an infinite ( non - compact ) surface is actually minor , from a practical ( lab ) point of view .",
    "one can truncate the beltrami , without changing the topology , and still has a surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "( notice , also , that the elliptic and hyperbolic pseudospheres are finite surfaces , so , for them , this problem is absent ) .",
    "so one can think of tiling the surface in the standard way illustrated above .",
    "the issue here is the number and types of defects necessary , and , in turn , how the euler - poincar and gauss - bonnet theorems apply here , as they have been conceived for compact surfaces .    having the topology of an annulus , the euler number for beltrami is @xcite _ beltrami = 0 .",
    "( the same is true for the other two pseudospheres , not clear is the matter for more exotic pseudospheres @xcite ) .",
    "if one blindly applies ( [ euler ] ) , @xmath115 , the implications do not make sense .",
    "would that mean that @xmath116 ?",
    "so i can tile with hexagons all over ?",
    "but that is true for the plane , the cylinder , or the cone , not for the pseudosphere .",
    "would that mean that @xmath117 ?",
    "but then i can satisfy the constraint with even 1 heptagon and 1 pentagon , and this makes no sense either .",
    "the unsolved ( and intriguing ) problem here is that , as far as i know , it is not known the negative curvature counterpart of the dodecahedron ( or , of its dual , the icosahedron ) , the `` elementary '' polyhedron one obtains from the euler - poincar for the sphere .",
    "there must be a fixed number of heptagons , that take into account the basic geometric properties , just like the 12 pentagons do for the sphere .",
    "the beauty and intricacies of the lobachevsky geometry come in here , and make changes to the sphere story , and then introduce the singular boundaries , but the basic object should be there to give a unifying `` platonic - lobachevsky '' solid for all the infinite pseudospheres ( not just the three that clearly have @xmath118 , but all the others ) .",
    "a partial solution to this problem , and in turn to our main problem ( wrapping graphene to make a beltrami ) , is to consider that the gauss - bonnet for surfaces with boundaries is @xcite _ d^2 + _ k_g dl = 2 , [ gbfull ] with @xmath119 the geodesic curvature that measures how far is a curve from a geodesic ( e.g. , @xmath120 for the equator of a sphere ) . in ( [ gbfull ] ) there are two parts , one for the bulk that is the total curvature , @xmath121 , and one for the boundaries .",
    "it is @xmath121 that tells about the number of defects , the boundary term does not . indeed , from @xmath122",
    ", we have @xmath123 , ( the same is true for the other two pseudospheres ) , hence , using ( [ curvhept ] ) , @xmath124 , that gives n_7 = 6 . in other words , the euler - poincar and the gauss - bonnet theorems `` decouple '' for pseudospheres , and we can not apply ( [ euler ] ) to compute the number of defects , but need the curvature arguments just given .",
    "that said , though , everything else is like for the sphere : the negative curvature counterpart of the icosahedron / dodecahedron , at least for the three classic pseudospheres , has 6 heptagons , arranged to form a non - compact `` polyhedron''(actually , i did not succeeded to use only heptagons , and a certain number of hexagons are necessary even for the basic object ) , and , elastic energy allowing , one can add pentagon - heptagon pairs .",
    "this is my solution of the issue ( i ) in the list above .",
    "let me now face the other issues .",
    "the procedure to map a surface onto a plane is called `` planar development '' @xcite .",
    "for the intrinsically flat surfaces , this can be done isometrically ( that is why those surfaces are called `` developable '' ) .",
    "for intrinsically curved surfaces , planar development comes at the price of deforming the distance among points ( think of any map of the earth ) , hence of trading curvature for strain , and there are infinitely many different `` planar versions '' of the curved surface , see , e.g. , @xcite . at first sight , the effects we are describing with ( [ theformula ] ) , being due to intrinsic curvature , could never be seen on a planar development . in the case in point of the graphene membrane , though , there is some hope to still have some sort of signal of the hawking - unruh effect , although we can expect it to be substantially deformed by the planar development .",
    "it is so , because , in our model , the intrinsic curvature of the graphene membrane is encoded in the heptagonal defects , hence , retaining these defects in the developed beltrami surface , in principle , could be the way out to test the effect on a flat sample .",
    "unfortunately , the geometric constraints on the development , and the limits of the experimental set - up of the device of manoharan lab , conspired to make this test impossible .",
    "let me explain in a bit more detail .",
    "the actual values of various important quantities differ , for graphene and for molecular graphene ( for the latter i rely on @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) . in the table",
    "[ secondtable ] , i summarize the ones relevant for this discussion .",
    "there , i give two energy scales , @xmath125 ( below which the continuum dirac field approximation holds ) , and @xmath126 ( below which the field theory in curved space time holds ) .",
    "the formula ( [ theformula ] ) has a chance to be tested only if @xmath127 , and it holds for energies below @xmath128 . on this",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "essentially , what goes wrong with the manoharan lab set - up is that , even to just include all the necessary 6 heptagons , the limited number of points makes the density of defects ( hence , the corresponding curvature ) too close to the limit for the model to hold .",
    "given the values of @xmath14 and @xmath75 , and the maximum sensitivity of the stm machine of 1 - 10 mev , to a small enough curvature ( big @xmath111 ) corresponds an energy too small to detect the effect in that range ( see the entry for @xmath129 in table  [ secondtable ] , and consider that the electrons need to have an energy below the corresponding @xmath128 ) .",
    ".values of various important quantities , for graphene and for molecular graphene .",
    "here @xmath130 , with @xmath15 hopping parameter , @xmath75 nearest - neighbor distance , and @xmath125 , @xmath126 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ firsttable ]    for all these reasons , the last proposal that was left to test the model , within these limits , was to see whether some relics of the effect are still there , for a configuration of planar molecular graphene that includes few heptagonal defects ( with this , at least the condition of small curvature of the original surface is better satisfied / less unsatisfied , see table  [ firsttable ] ) . in this fashion",
    ", the sample could mimic the planar development of a _ portion _ of a generic ( not necessarily constant ) negatively curved surface .",
    "the answer , as said , is negative .",
    "let me explain why .",
    "one piece of good news here arrived from the discovery that the issue ( iii ) of the list has positive answer .",
    "namely , it is indeed possible to have a modified and approximate version of formula ( [ theformula ] ) at work , for small neighbors of a point of a graphene membrane shaped into a generic surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "indeed , it is true that , as discussed in the @xmath65 step of the previous section ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , that the global predictability for the given surface in the lab frame is lost , but , as long as local considerations are concerned , some predictive power of ( [ theformula ] ) is still at work .",
    "full details of this result will be given elsewhere .",
    "for the moment let me say that the main reason for this is that the horizon , in this model , is reached `` time - wise '' , like in the standard unruh effect , and not `` space - wise '' , i.e. the horizon is not a specific curve on the manifold .",
    "being the time @xmath15 the same for all surfaces in the lab frame @xmath61 , the effect is still there for all , although modified and only valid portion by portion of the surface .",
    "nonetheless ( leaving aside the issue of constant vs nonconstant @xmath39 ) , one thing is to _ focus _ on one portion ( neighbor of a point ) of a whole surface , for which the global conditions for the existence of an horizon ( hence the hawking ) are realized , and another thing is to have a _ detached _ ( cut - away ) portion of that surface .",
    "for instance , in order to feel the curvature , the electrons need ho have enough time to travel back and forth on the _ whole _ surface , an instance that also means that the electrons that feel the curvature are those of small energy .",
    "when this takes place on a surface , the electrons come back to the initial point ( for a non - compact surface , at least some of them ) , while for a piece cut - away from the surface , obviously this can not happen .",
    "thus , there is no hope to see any effect that originates from global properties , as the hawking - unruh of ( [ theformula ] ) .    to conclude on a positive note : although it was impossible to test these ideas in the experimental settings of manoharan s lab ( that were not meant to test these kind of effects , in the first place ) , the fact that we can test them on a generic surface of constant negative @xmath39 is very promising for future , dedicated experiments .",

    "<S> a recently proposed step - by - step procedure , to merge the low - energy physics of the @xmath0-bonds electrons of graphene , and quantum field theory on curved spacetimes , is recalled . </S>",
    "<S> the last step there is the proposal of an experiment to test a hawking - unruh effect , emerging from the model , that manifests itself as an exact ( within the model ) prediction for the electronic local density of states , in the ideal case of the graphene membrane shaped as a beltrami pseudosphere . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion about one particular attempt to experimentally test the model on molecular graphene is presented , and it is taken as an excuse to solve some basic issues that will help future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is stated that the effect should be visible on generic surfaces of constant negative gaussian curvature , that are infinite in number . </S>"
