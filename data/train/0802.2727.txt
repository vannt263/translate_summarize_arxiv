    "let me first begin to say that , given the high density of the scientific program , i had to make a drastic selection and i apologize to the speakers , not or badly , mentioned in this summary .",
    "this is partly due to the lack of time and partly to my unability to `` digest '' quickly enough , all this new information .",
    "i will not touch technical talks because it is not my field .",
    "fortunately , missing material can be found in these proceedings , collecting all the write - ups of the presentations .",
    "+ from what we heard , it is amazing to realize that spin has some relevance all over the places , in a vast energy range from 100 mev up to several tev and in very many different collision processes , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc ... it is involved in numerous experiment facilities like , for example , rarf , clas , hermes , hera , compass , belle , rhic , etc .... one notices also that significant advances have been achieved recently in polarized beams and targets , allowing to reach higher precision in the new measurements .",
    "new projects are under way , which i will just mention : in fair at gsi , the panda detector has a broad physics program to study qcd with antiprotons , at protvino , u70 is preparing a new polarization program , as well as here in dubna with the nuclotron - m .",
    "on the theory side , the terminology used is also very rich since one has currently to decode the following sets of initials , pdf , gpd , tmd , dvcs , dis , sidis , dglap , bfkl , nlo , nnlo , ht , ssa , etc ... + once more , it was clear at this meeting that substantial progress emerge whenever experiment and theory are `` talking to each other '' .",
    "i will try to find the right balence between new experimental results and recent theoretical developments , which have most impressed me , but it was a rather difficult exercice .",
    "the compass experiment at the cern sps has undertaken a vast experimental program focused on the nucleon spin structure via deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of 160 gev polarized muons on polarized nucleons .",
    "they have obtained very precise results in two kinematic ranges , q@xmath5 1 gev@xmath6 and 0.0005 @xmath7 0.02 , as well as 1 @xmath8 100 gev@xmath6 and 0.004 @xmath7 0.7 , for the spin - dependent structure function @xmath9 , by measuring the longitudinal photon - deuteron asymmetry @xmath10 , with a polarized deuteron target .",
    "this asymmetry , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( left ) , is compatible with zero over the small @xmath11 range and this indicates a strong cancellation between the polarization of the different sea quarks . for large @xmath11",
    "the asymmetry is large and positive , in agreement with earlier data from smc and hermes .",
    "they have also discussed the results of a global qcd fit at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , to the world data on @xmath12 , which , unfortunately , does not lead to a unique determination of the gluon polarization @xmath13 . +",
    "another interesting subject is the evaluation of the polarized valence quark distributions @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis is based on the asymmetry difference a@xmath15 , for hadrons of opposite charges and it gives direct access to the valence quark helicity distributions , as the fragmentation functions do cancel out .",
    "the results , shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ( right ) , provide information on the contribution of the sea quarks to the nucleon spin .",
    "they favour an asymmetric scenario for the sea polarisation , @xmath16 , at a confidence level of two standard deviations , in contrast to the usual symmetric assumption , @xmath17 .",

    "three different channels sensitive to the gluon distribution are being explored : open charm production and high transverse momentum ( high-@xmath26 ) production , in either the quasi - real ( virtuality @xmath27  gev@xmath6 ) photoproduction or the dis ( @xmath28  gev@xmath6 ) regimes .",

    ", they got the following estimate @xmath34 , with a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath35 . polarized inclusive dis is also used to determine @xmath36 , the quark contribution to the nucleon spin , and under some reasonable assumptions , they reported @xmath37 .",
    "flavor separation for the quark helicity distributions has been achieved from semi - inclusive dis data and , in particular , one gets @xmath38 , by means of @xmath39 production , which is a preliminary result .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries were measured in the semi - inclusive production of pions and kaons and hermes has collected data with a transversely polarized hydrogen target from 2002 to 2005 .",
    "the polarized part of the semi - inclusive cross section , for unpolarized beam ( u ) and a transversely polarized target ( t ) , has contributions from both the collins and sivers mechanisms .",
    "these asymmetries provide information on the quark collins and sivers distribution functions .",
    "these mechanisms produce a different dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry on the two angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so one can use the variation of @xmath40 and @xmath41 to disentangle the two contributions experimentally .",

    "it consists of colliding polarized protons to study the spin structure of the proton . for 2006",
    "they have achieved high luminosity collisions at @xmath66=200  gev , with 55 to 60% polarization and performed sensitive measurements on the gluon polarization .",
    "lower @xmath26 production of @xmath67 or jets is dominated by the gluon - gluon graph , and the double helicity asymmetry @xmath68 at mid - rapidity is essentially quadratic in the gluon polarization . at higher",

    "the asymmetries at 62  gev are very large , and significantly larger than the asymmetries at 200  gev . at this energy",
    ", star has also measured a remarkable asymmetry for @xmath67 production , which increases with @xmath71 , for positive @xmath71 and is consistent with zero for negative @xmath71 . a very exciting direction for the transverse spin program is connecting semi - inclusive dis and rhic results .",
    "g. bunce recalled that the final state interaction needed to generate the asymmetry of dis and the corresponding initial state interaction of drell - yan , have different color interactions , giving in general an attractive force for dis and a negative force for drell - yan , resulting in opposite sign transverse spin asymmetries .",
    "this unique prediction of gauge theory must be checked and this will be done at rhic .",
    "clas data for @xmath72 in several bins of @xmath73 for the proton ( left ) and deuteron , per nucleon ( right ) ( taken from dodge s talk).,width=170 ]    the clas collaboration at jefferson lab is pursuing a wide program of measurements with polarized electrons incident on polarized proton and deuteron targets , which was partially covered in the talk of g. dodge .",
    "it involves inclusive , semi - inclusive and exclusive inelastic scattering over a wide kinematical range in momentum transfer @xmath73 .",
    "the data are consistent with the expectation that the @xmath74 asymmetry should approach 1 as @xmath75 and they find that @xmath76 remains negative up to @xmath77 , consistent with results from hall a using a @xmath78he target .",
    "they also studied the onset of quark - hadron duality in spin structure functions .",
    "quark - hadron duality refers to the observation that the unpolarized structure function @xmath79 , in the resonance region , averages to the smooth scaling curve for @xmath79 at high @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] one displays @xmath72 for the proton and deuteron as a function of @xmath11 for various @xmath73 bins .",
    "the high @xmath73  scaling \" curve is shown by the hatched area and indicates the range of @xmath72 given by pdf fits . at low @xmath73",
    "one can see that the data are negative in the region of the @xmath80(1232 ) resonance , as expected for a spin 3/2 excitation .",
    "however , as @xmath73 increases and the @xmath81 loses strength , the resonances do indeed appear to oscillate about the scaling curve .",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) , introduced 10 years ago , is a powerful tool which offers a way to unify two pictures of the nucleon , disconnected so far , on the one hand the pdf s @xmath82 , obtained from dis , and on the other hand the nucleon form factors @xmath83 , obtained from @xmath84 elastic scattering .",
    "the gpd s provide a three - dimensional picture of the nucleon and therefore a more detailed information on its partonic structure , designated `` nucleon tomography '' by n. dhose .",
    "one hopes to gain some insight on the localization of partons inside the nucleon and to access to their orbital angular momentum @xmath85 , as first suggested by x. d. ji .",
    "gpd s can be extracted experimentally through the measurement of hard exclusive reactions , the cleanest one is the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs)(or meson production ) , shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . in the reaction",
    "@xmath86 , the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , dominates over dvcs in most of the kinematic region . however , measurable asymmetries in beam spin and beam charge arise from the interference of both processes .",
    "the beam spin asymmetry is proportional to the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude , while the beam charge asymmetry is proportional to the real part of the dvcs amplitude and both asymmetries can be expressed in terms of gpd s .",
    "several models are emerging and predictions made from lattice qcd for the first moments of the nucleon gpd s confirm that the transverse size of the nucleon depends significantly on the momentum fraction @xmath11 .",
    "the kinematical domain accessible in compass and its availability of positive and negative polarized muons gives it a major opportunity to measure the different configurations of charge and spin of the beam , as explained by n. dhose .",
    "finally , let us mention the results presented by a. borissov on exclusive diffractive production of light vector mesons ( @xmath87 and @xmath40 ) on hydrogen and deuterium targets , measured by hermes in the kinematic region @xmath88 gev@xmath6 and @xmath89 gev .",
    "data for the @xmath73 and @xmath90 dependences of longitudinal cross sections and spin density matrix elements are in fair agreement with gpd calculations based on the ` handbag factorization ' .",
    "this model was presented by s. goloskokov and it seems to work well up to hera energies .",
    "several talks were devoted to single spin asymmetries and their connection to the sivers and collins effects , which generate the most sizeable single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) with transverse target polarization , as already mentioned above . in his talk a. efremov",
    "gave our present understanding of these phenomena .",
    "within some uncertainties it was found that the sidis data from hermes and compass , on the sivers and collins ssa from different targets , are in agreement with each other and with belle data on azimuthal correlations in @xmath0-annihilations . at the present stage of the art ,",
    "large-@xmath91 predictions for the flavour dependence of the sivers function are compatible with data , and provide useful constraints .",
    "the global analysis of hermes , compass and belle data reported by a. prokudin is leading to the extraction of favoured and unfavoured collins fragmentation functions and the unknown transversity distributions for @xmath92 and @xmath93 quarks , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "they turn out to be opposite in sign , with @xmath96 smaller than @xmath97 , and both are smaller than their corresponding soffer bound .",
    "this is just a first step for extracting transversities , as noticed by m. wakamatsu , who carried out a comparative analysis of the transversities and the longitudinally polarized pdf s .",
    "he concluded that a complete understanding of the spin dependent fragmentation mechanism is mandatory for getting more definite knowledge of the transversities and that some independent determination of transversities is highly desirable , for example , through double transverse spin asymmetry in drell - yan processes .",
    "o. teryaev recalled that twist - three quark - gluon correlators were proposed long ago to explain non - zero ssa and he presented some arguments to establish a relation between the sivers function and these twist - three matrix elements . as a result , the sivers mechanism may be applied at large momentum transfer .",
    "it is also possible to find some connection between sivers function and gpd .      in his talk ,",
    "a. sidorov studied the impact of the clas and latest compass data on the polarized parton densities and higher twist ( ht ) contributions .",
    "it was demonstrated that the inclusion of the low @xmath73 clas data in the nlo qcd analysis of the world dis data improves essentially our knowledge of ht corrections to @xmath98 and does not affect the central values of pdf s .",
    "however the large @xmath73 compass data influence mainly the strange quark and gluon polarizations , but practically do not change the ht corrections .",
    "the uncertainties in the determination of polarized parton densities is significantly reduced due to both data sets and he concluded that it is impossible to describe the very precise clas data , if the ht corrections are not taken into account .",
    "b. ermolaev presented a description of spin structure function @xmath98 at arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is known that the extrapolation of dglap to the very small-@xmath11 involves necessarily the singular fits for the initial parton densities without any theoretical basis . on the contrary , according to b. ermolaev , the resummation of the leading logarithms of @xmath11 is the straightforward and most natural way to describe @xmath98 at small @xmath11 . combining this resummation with the dglap results leads to the expressions for @xmath98 which can be used at large @xmath73 and arbitrary @xmath11 , leaving the initial parton densities non - singular .",
    "the talk presented by x. artru contains two parts . in the first one",
    ", he recalls that positivity restrains the allowed domains for pairs or triples of spin observables in polarised reactions , some of which having non - trivial shapes .",
    "various domain shapes in reactions of the type @xmath99 are displayed and some methods to determine these domains are mentioned . the second part deals with classical and quantum constraints in spin physics , from both discrete symmetries and positivity .    finally , a. a. pankov considered the @xmath0 international linear collider ( ilc ) to study four - fermion contact interactions in fermion pair production process @xmath100 and he stressed the role played by the initial state polarization , to increase the potentiality of this future machine to discover new phenomena .",
