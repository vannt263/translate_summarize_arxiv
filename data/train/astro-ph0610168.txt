    "thermonuclear combustion was originally proposed as the mechanism behind type ia supernovae @xcite . however",
    ", this detonation - based model was soon shown to be unable to explain a host of observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite recognized the possibility that a deflagration , a subsonic mode of combustion following a mild ignition of stellar material in the center of a massive white dwarf , might help to ameliorate these deficiencies .",
    "flames characteristic of a deflagration are subject to the rayleigh - taylor instability in the gravitational field in the interior of a white dwarf , significantly complicating any detailed calculation of this mode of burning .",
    "the parameterized one - dimensional study of @xcite indicated that a successful explosion model may require a substantial increase in the speed of the deflagrating front .",
    "such an increase in burning speed was observed in the multi - dimensional models of @xcite , though @xcite recognized that their models lacked a proper description of turbulence ( and also lacked details of the microphysics ) taking place on scales unresolved in their simulations .",
    "the structure and dynamics of deflagration fronts on rayleigh - taylor - dominated scales were studied in detail by @xcite . in particular",
    ", khokhlov proposed that when a steady state of fully - devloped turbulence is assumed , the evolution of the flame propagation becomes independent of details of the microphysics and is governed by a self - regulating mechanism reflecting an interplay between the rayleigh - taylor instability and nuclear burning .",
    "khokhlov ( 1995 ) provides scaling relations for the turbulent flame speed and these scalings are used to construct a subgrid - scale ( sgs ) model which , combined with a flame capturing scheme , offers a powerful tool for studying deflagrations in type ia supernovae .    the use of subgrid - scale models in modeling of type ia supernovae is necessitated by the vastly disparate temporal and spatial scales present in the problem . without exception , all groups involved in studying thermonuclear supernovae use some sort of subgrid - scale model . in the khokhlov self - regulation scenario ,",
    "the turbulent flame speed is primarily determined by the speed of large - scale motions driven by the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "this speed is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the atwood number , @xmath4 is the local gravitational acceleration , and @xmath1 is the driving scale . in this subgrid model , it is assumed that a steady state of fully - developed turbulence obtains instantaneously , leading to a state of self regulation where the interplay of the rt instability and the local progress of the flame serves to render the turbulent flame speed roughly constant in time",
    ". however , the model does not take into account the initial transient phase nor the unsteadiness of local turbulent velocities .",
    "the subgrid model of @xcite uses the framework of kolmogorov turbulence theory as a starting point . in their model , the burning speed is locally determined from the turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath5 , which is evolved through the use of a local transport equation @xcite .",
    "this model has been used extensively to study thermonuclear deflagrations both without @xcite and , later , with @xcite a flame front tracking scheme . despite the fundamental differences in these subgrid models , the results obtained ( explosion energetics , timescale , and ejecta morphology ) are quite similar for deflagrations in the self - regulation regime @xcite . accordingly",
    ", we can conclude that in the self - regulation regime differences between specific subgrid models do not lead to gross differences in the flame evolution .",
    "our aim here is to improve the original khokhlov subgrid - scale model ( hereafter ksgs ) and develop a new subgrid model that can be applied not only to the self - regulation regime but also to the initial transient phase before self regulation has been fully established .",
    "the inclusion of a description of this transient phase in the subgrid model is especially important for the simulation of the early evolution of deflagrations in type ia supernovae .    to develop the new subgrid model , we have first conducted a survey of thermonuclear model flame simulations on periodic domains .",
    "these results allow us to develop a deeper understanding of the flame dynamics on small scales and provide a foundation for the improved scheme .",
    "in our study of model thermonuclear flames , we consider the evolution of the reactive eulerian equations in cartesian geometry .",
    "numerical solutions were obtained with the flash  code @xcite .",
    "the majority of the models presented here were computed in three - dimensions , while a limited number of models have been calculated in two - dimensions .",
    "we assume a constant gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 , aligned with and pointing along the negative z coordinate .",
    "the computational domain is a tube ( a channel in 2d ) with square cross - section .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions along the lateral ( i.e.  @xmath7 ) directions .",
    "we impose reflecting boundary conditions at the bottom of the tube , while allowing outflow through its top boundary .",
    "the time steps in our simulation were limited with courant factor of 0.6 .    in order to save computational resources ,",
    "we use flash s adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability and only resolve regions actively participating in combustion . in these regions , we track flow structures characterized by large jumps in density , total velocity , or progress variable .    at the initial time , a one - dimensional flame front structure is interpolated onto the grid with the flame front position , @xmath8 , defined as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the unperturbed position of the front , @xmath11 is the amplitude of the perturbation , and @xmath12 is the wavelength of the perturbation in the lateral directions .",
    "the fuel filling the tube ahead of the flame front is initially at rest and composed entirely of equal mass fractions of carbon and oxygen .",
    "the fuel s density is @xmath13 g/@xmath14 and its temperature is @xmath15 .",
    "we consider here only a one - step reaction in the burning front with a constant prescribed energy release of @xmath16 erg / g ( i.e. the total energy that would be released in taking the initial carbon - oxygen mix to a composition of all iron ) .",
    "we use a helmholtz equation of state @xcite suitable for the degenerate conditions considered here .",
    "the original flash  code has been equipped with a custom implementation of the flame - capturing algorithm of @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the flame front is described as a diffuse , thick interface of a progress variable , @xmath17 , whose evolution is governed by an advection - diffusion - reaction ( adr ) equation :    @xmath18    here @xmath17 is constrained to lie between @xmath19 ( unburned material , or fuel ) and @xmath20 ( completely burned material , or ash ) . the diffusion and reaction coefficients , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",

    "this is the essential property of the self - regulation mechanism discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , the independence of the deviation of turbulent flame speed versus laminar flame speed has not been discussed in that previous study .      as discussed in the previous section , the flame exhibits a semi - periodic behavior once a steady state is established .",
    "a natural question then is `` what is the source of the oscillation ? ''",
    "it is conceivable that the oscillation is caused by interference between the flame and acoustic waves generated at the bottom wall boundary . on the other hand , it could be an intrinsic property of rayleigh - taylor unstable flames . in order to determine whether of these hypotheses",
    "is likely we perform a 1d test without flame propagation . in this test",
    "an initial vertical downward velocity is imposed on the fluid and the propagation of sound waves generated at the bottom wall is examined .",
    "we find that the sound waves quickly reach the top boundary and leave the computational domain .",
    "the fluid becomes essentially at rest once the sound wave propagates off the grid .",
    "in addition , a simulation of flame propagation in 2d with both the top and bottom boundaries open have been performed and the same semi - periodic behavior found in our fiducial models is observed .",
    "on the basis of these experiments , we conclude that flames subject to the rayleigh - taylor instability are intrinsically oscillatory . in 2d ,",
    "the rising bubbles filled with hot burned material are analogous to a cylinder passing through a fluid .",
    "it is well known that this schematic situation typically results in the formation of a vortex street in the wake of the cylinder @xcite .",

    "<S> previously observed periodic behavior of the flame evolution is reproduced and is found to be caused by the turnover of the largest eddies . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic timescales are found to be similar to the turnover time of these eddies . </S>",
    "<S> relations between flame surface creation and destruction processes and basic characteristics of the flow are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the flame surface creation strength is associated with the rayleigh - taylor time scale . </S>",
    "<S> also , in fully - developed turbulence , the flame surface destruction strength scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the turbulent driving scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our investigation provide support for khokhlov s self - regulating model of turbulent thermonuclear flames ( khokhlov 1995 ) . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> , one can revise and extend the original model . </S>",
    "<S> the revision uses a local description of the flame surface enhancement and the evolution of the flame surface since the onset of turbulence , rendering it free from the assumption of an instantaneous steady state of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this new model can be applied to the initial transient phase of the flame evolution , where the self - regulation mechanism yet to be fully established . </S>",
    "<S> details of this new model will be presented in a forthcoming paper . </S>"
