    "recently a tremendous amount of interest has focused on anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "this interest is mainly motivated by the proposed correspondence between physical effects associated with gravitating fields propagating in ads spacetime and those of a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of ads spacetime @xcite .    in this context , the black holes with cosmological constant @xmath1 are of special interest since they would offer the possibility of studying the nonperturbative structure of some cfts .",
    "higher dimensional rotating black holes with ads asymptotics have been studied by various authors , starting with hawking @xmath2 @xcite who generalized the @xmath3 kerr - ads solution to five dimensions with arbitrary angular momenta , and to all dimensions with only a single nonzero angular momentum .",
    "the generalization of these solutions to the full set of independent angular momenta was given in @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to generalize these higher dimensional kerr - ads metrics further , by including matter fields .",
    "several exact solutions describing charged rotating black holes have been found recently in gauged supergravities in @xmath4 @xcite , and @xmath5 @xcite dimensions .",
    "apart from abelian fields with a chern - simons term , these configurations usually contain scalar fields with a nontrivial scalar potential .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to report progress on this problem by presenting numerical evidence for the existence a set of asymptotically ads charged rotating black holes .",
    "these configurations exist in an odd number of dimensions , @xmath6 .",
    "they possess a regular horizon of spherical topology , and their angular momenta are all of equal - magnitude , thus factorizing the angular dependence .",
    "the same approach was employed recently to construct asymptotically flat charged rotating black holes in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "also , instead of specializing to a particular supergravity model , we shall consider pure einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory with negative cosmological constant .",
    "although this theory is non - supersymmetric in itself for @xmath7 , it enters all gauged supergravities as the basic building block . therefore one can expect the basic features of its solutions to be generic .    the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we present the general framework and analyze the field equations .",
    "the boundary conditions and the black hole properties are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we present the numerical results for @xmath4 and @xmath8 black holes in section 4 , and conclude with section 5 , where further applications are addressed .",
    "we consider the em action with a negative cosmological constant @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the @xmath14-dimensional newton constant , @xmath15 is the curvature scalar , and @xmath16 is the gauge field strength tensor ( @xmath17 , with gauge potential @xmath18 ) . the last term in ( [ action - grav ] ) is the hawking - gibbons surface term @xcite , which is required in order to have a well - defined variational principle .",
    "@xmath19 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the induced metric of the boundary .",
    "we denote @xmath22 .",
    "the field equations associated with the action ( [ action - grav ] ) are the einstein equations @xmath23 and the gauge field equations @xmath24    we consider stationary black hole space - times with @xmath25 azimuthal symmetries , representing charged @xmath26 generalizations of the corresponding set of vacuum solutions discussed in @xcite .",
    "the symmetries imply the existence of @xmath27 commuting killing vectors , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , for @xmath30 .",
    "while the general em - ads black holes then possess @xmath25 independent angular momenta , we here restrict to black holes with equal - magnitude angular momenta and with spherical horizon topology .",
    "we employ a parametrization for the metric corresponding to a generalization of the ansatz used previously for asymptotically flat solutions @xcite .",
    "it has the general form @xmath31 ^ 2 \\right\\ } \\ ,    \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 $ ] for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 $ ] for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denotes the sense of rotation in the @xmath39-th orthogonal plane of rotation . for such solutions ,",
    "the isometry group is enhanced from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , where @xmath15 denotes the time translation .",
    "this symmetry enhancement allows us to deal only with ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) .",
    "the vacuum black holes discussed in @xcite are recovered for vanishing gauge field and @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two constants related to the solutions mass and angular momentum , and @xmath45 ( see @xcite for a discussion of the basic features of these solutions ) . for the numerical calculations",
    "a convenient parametrization is given by @xmath46    the ansatz for the u(1 ) potential , consistent with the symmetries of the line element ( [ metric ] ) , is given by @xcite @xmath47 thus , independent of the odd dimension @xmath48 , this parametrization involves only four functions @xmath49 for the metric and two functions @xmath50 for the gauge field , which all depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath51 .    when ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ gaugepotential ] ) are substituted into ( [ ee ] ) and ( [ feqa ] ) , a coupled system of ode s is obtained ( one first - order equation ( for @xmath52 ) plus five second - order equations ( for @xmath53 ) ) .",
    "however , taking advantage of the existence of a first integral of that system @xmath54 we may eliminate @xmath55 from the equations , leaving a system of one first order equation ( for @xmath52 ) and four second order equations @xcite .",
    "in order to generate black hole solutions which are asymptotically ads and possess a regular event horizon of spherical topology , we have to impose appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "a straightforward computation gives the following asymptotic expansion for the metric and matter fields , involving five parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 therefore , in the numerical procedure , we impose the following boundary conditions at infinity @xmath59    the horizon of these black hole solutions is a squashed @xmath60 sphere .",
    "it resides at the constant value of the radial coordinate @xmath61 , and is characterized by @xmath62 . expanding the metric and matter functions at the horizon yields @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 positive constants ) . here",
    "@xmath65 is the ( constant ) horizon angular velocity defined in terms of the killing vector @xmath66 which is null at the horizon .",
    "@xmath67 denotes the ( constant ) horizon electrostatic potential , and the compactified radial coordinate @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 .    at the horizon ,",
    "the solutions satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath70      in an asymptotically flat spacetime , the total mass @xmath71 and the angular momenta @xmath72 of the black holes are obtained from the komar expressions associated with the respective killing vector fields . for ads asymptotics ,",
    "the calculation of the total mass is more involved , mainly because the analogous komar integral for the relevant time - like killing vector diverges , which then requires a regularization .",
    "various definitions of the conserved charges for an ads background have been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "employing first the ashtekar - magnon - das conformal mass definition @xcite , we obtain for the mass of rotating em black holes the expression @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the area of the unit @xmath75-sphere , and @xmath76 the constants in the asymptotic expansion ( [ exp_inf ] ) .",
    "a different technique , proposed by balasubramanian and kraus @xcite , was inspired by the ads / cft correspondence and consists in adding suitable counterterms @xmath77 to the action of the theory in order to ensure the finiteness of the boundary stress tensor @xmath78 derived by the quasilocal energy definition @xcite . the expression for the mass we obtain in this approach and 9 dimensions by using the expressions of the counterterms and boundary stress - tensor given @xmath79 in ref .",
    "if there are matter fields on @xmath80 , additional counterterms may be needed to regularize the action and global charges .",
    "however , we have found that for a purely abelian matter content , the usual counterterm prescription removes all divergences . ]",
    "contains besides the expression ( [ mass ] ) for the mass an additional term @xmath81 , which depends only on @xmath82 and @xmath14 ( @xmath79 @xmath83 ) .",
    "@xmath81 corresponds to the mass of the pure global ads@xmath84 and is usually interpreted as the energy dual to the casimir energy of the dual cft defined on the @xmath85-dimensional boundary metric @xcite .",
    "the angular momenta @xmath72 may be computed from the standard komar integral , since the divergent term vanishes .",
    "the komar integral reads @xmath86 with @xmath87 , and for equal - magnitude angular momenta @xmath88 , @xmath30 . with ( [ exp_inf ] )",
    "we then obtain for the angular momentum the expression @xmath89 which agrees with the value found within the counterterm approach ) and the number of conserved charges of the solution , which we could not clarify . for @xmath90 ,",
    "one finds @xmath91 , while @xmath92 in the static limit .",
    "however , for charged rotating solutions , the numerical results do not indicate the existence of any simple correlation between the constants @xmath93 and @xmath94 in ( [ exp_inf ] ) . ] .",
    "the electric charge is related to the first integral ( [ first_integral ] ) by @xmath95 and the magnetic moment @xmath96 is given by @xmath97    a further quantity of physical interest is the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath98 of these charged rotating ads black holes , defined as @xmath99      employing the expansion at the horizon ( [ exp_hor ] ) , we obtain for the surface gravity @xmath100 , defined by @xmath101 the expression @xmath102 and for the horizon area @xmath103 to have a measure of the deformation of the horizon , we introduce a deformation parameter defined as the ratio of the equatorial circumference @xmath104 and the polar one @xmath105 , which for these solutions we are considering takes the form @xmath106    the horizon mass @xmath107 and the horizon angular momentum @xmath108 can be computed by evaluating the corresponding komar integrals at the horizon @xcite , leading to @xmath109   \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & j_{\\rm h } = \\frac{1}{8\\pi g_d ( d-1 ) } a(s^{d-2 } ) r^{d-2}_{\\rm    h } \\sqrt{\\frac{m^{d-4}_2 n^3_2}{f^{d}_2 } } \\left ( 2   r_{\\rm h } \\omega -    \\left.\\frac{d^2\\omega}{d { \\bar{x}}^2 }     \\right|_{{\\bar{x}}=0 } \\right )   \\ . \\label{hor_mj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these horizon quantities are related by the horizon mass formula @xmath110 to obtain the global counterpart of ( [ hor_mass_formula ] ) remains a challenge",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the approach used in @xcite , to derive a smarr - type formula for kerr - ads solutions , to the case discussed in this paper .",
    "these rotating black holes possess an ergosurface , inside of which observers can not remain stationary , but will move in the direction of the rotation .",
    "the ergosurface is located at a constant value of the radial coordinate @xmath111 , with @xmath112 , @xmath113 @xmath114 and does not intersect the horizon .",
    "also , as a result of the metric ansatz ( [ metric ] ) , @xmath115 is a global time coordinate ( @xmath116 ) , and no closed causal curves occur in the region outside the event horizon .",
    "the numerical methods employed here are analogous to those used to construct asymptotically flat charged rotating black holes @xcite . working with the compactified coordinate @xmath117 , we choose units such that @xmath118 , and apply a collocation method for boundary - value ordinary differential equations , equipped with an adaptive mesh selection procedure @xcite .",
    "typical mesh sizes include @xmath119 points .",
    "the solutions have a relative accuracy of @xmath120 .    in the following we focus on the properties of @xmath4 black hole solutions .",
    "these results can be easily extended to odd dimensions @xmath8 , since the main features of the solutions are common for all odd dimensions .",
    "we note , that the computation of the mass involves @xmath121 terms in the asymptotic expansion , decreasing the numerical accuracy of the mass as @xmath14 increases .",
    "let us first address the domain of existence of these black hole solutions . in order to do so",
    ", we note that the solutions have a scale symmetry , which is broken once the value of the cosmological constant is fixed : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , etc . to classify solutions related by this symmetry",
    ", we introduce the scale invariant ratio @xmath129    in fig .  1 ( left ) we show the domain of existence of @xmath4 solutions for several values of @xmath130",
    ". the domain of existence is bounded by extremal solutions , which are characterized by a vanishing surface gravity @xmath100 . for finite @xmath130 the extremal curve that delimits the corresponding region of existence reaches the @xmath131 axis at @xmath132 and at a finite value of @xmath133 , affiliated to the corresponding extremal higher dimensional reissner - nordstrm ( rn)-ads solutions . for @xmath134 , respectively , in fig .",
    "1 ( left ) agree accurately with the numerical values . ]",
    "as @xmath130 increases , the origin is approached more and more steeply and , in the limit @xmath135 , the extremal curve consists of two pieces : the pure em part ( without cosmological constant ) @xcite , plus a vertical line corresponding to uncharged kerr - ads solutions .",
    "clearly , the domain of existence enlarges with increasing @xmath130 , and is symmetric with respect to @xmath136 .",
    "we now turn to non - extremal black holes , and analyze their asymptotic properties .",
    "we first consider the global charges of @xmath4 black hole solutions , obtained by keeping the charge @xmath137 and the isotropic horizon radius @xmath138 fixed , while varying the horizon angular velocity @xmath65 .",
    "the mass @xmath71 of these solutions as given by ( [ mass ] ) is exhibited in fig .  1 ( right ) , together with the mass of their higher dimensional kerr - ads counterparts .    for each set of solutions",
    "we observe two branches , extending up to a maximal value of @xmath65 , where they merge and end .",
    "the lower branch emerges from the static solution in the limit @xmath139 . on the upper branch",
    "the mass diverges in the limit @xmath140 .",
    "thus a static horizon ( @xmath139 ) can not be reached along the upper branch for finite @xmath82 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath65 depends on the horizon radius @xmath138 , the charge @xmath137 , the length @xmath82 , and the dimension @xmath14 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath141 of the solutions exhibits a very similar dependence on @xmath65 and @xmath82 as the mass .",
    "we note that , for a fixed value of the charge , its influence on the solutions , and thus their deviation from the corresponding higher dimensional kerr - ads solutions , decreases with increasing dimension @xmath14 , as expected from the scaling properties of the solutions .",
    "the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath98 of these solutions is exhibited in fig .  2 ( left ) .",
    "it reveals clearly , that @xmath142 is the limiting value of @xmath65 on the upper branch .",
    "we note that the @xmath98-factor ranges between @xmath143 and @xmath144 for finite values of @xmath82 , the value @xmath144 being reached along the upper branch , when @xmath145 .    in the limit @xmath146",
    ", the gyromagnetic ratio can be obtained analytically by linearly perturbing the higher dimensional kerr - ads solutions .",
    "we obtain for weakly charged solutions ( in the limit @xmath146 ) , possessing equal - magnitude angular momenta , @xmath147 with @xmath148{\\hat m } \\ , \\ \\ \\",
    "j=\\frac{a(s^{d-2})}{4 \\pi g_d } { \\hat m}{\\hat a } \\ .\\ ] ] this shows clearly , that @xmath98 ranges between @xmath143 and @xmath144 also for weakly charged solutions , since @xmath149 .",
    "we note , that for weakly charged solutions with a single non - vanishing angular momentum the @xmath98-factor ranges between @xmath143 and 2 @xcite .    in fig .  2 ( right ) we exhibit the dependence of the mass on @xmath82 , for fixed @xmath65 and @xmath138 , and several values of @xmath137",
    ". for fixed ( but not too large ) @xmath65",
    ", there is just a single solution when @xmath150 . when @xmath151 , depending on the value of the charge @xmath137 , there may be a maximal value of @xmath82 beyond which no solutions exist .",
    "as @xmath137 increases , this maximal value of @xmath82 decreases .",
    "we note that this pattern is in agreement with fig .  1 ( right ) .",
    "let us now address the horizon properties of the solutions , beginning with the surface gravity @xmath100 and the horizon area @xmath152 .",
    "for most of the sets of solutions with fixed @xmath138 , @xmath137 and @xmath82 and varying @xmath65 , @xmath100 decreases monotonically , reaching a vanishing value at @xmath153 , on the upper branch . at the same time ,",
    "the horizon area @xmath152 increases monotonically , diverging in the limit .",
    "complementary information on these solutions is obtained from fig .  3 ( left ) , where the dependence of the area on the isotropic horizon radius @xmath138 is exhibited , for fixed @xmath65 , @xmath137 , and @xmath82 .",
    "again we see , that @xmath154 marks the borderline , concerning the existence of one or two solutions . for @xmath155 , there is just a single solution for each value of @xmath138 , and @xmath138 can be increased without bound . in addition , as @xmath138 is increased , the difference between charged and uncharged solutions decreases . beyond @xmath156 and below a maximal value of @xmath65 ( given by the corresponding maximal value of @xmath65 for the extremal solution ) ,",
    "two solutions exist .",
    "to have a measure for the deformation of the horizon , we consider the ratio of equatorial and polar circumferences @xmath157 of the horizon .",
    "( the equatorial circumference @xmath158 is obtained with @xmath159 and constant @xmath160 , and the polar circumference @xmath161 with constant @xmath160 and @xmath162 . ) whereas kerr - ads solutions with equal angular momenta always have oblate deformation with ratio @xmath163 , we observe in fig .  3 ( right ) , that the presence of charge allows for prolate deformation of the horizon in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "we also exhibit the ergosurface ( isotropic ) radius @xmath164 versus the charge @xmath137 in fig .  4 ( left ) .",
    "the horizon area and the surface gravity of the solutions are related to the entropy and the temperature , respectively , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the dependence of the entropy on the temperature is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( right ) and discussed below with respect to the thermodynamical properties of the solutions .",
    "despite the increasing number of new interesting solutions , the closed form expression for the higher dimensional electrically charged rotating solutions in em theory has not yet been obtained .",
    "we have therefore applied a numerical approach to study these solutions and their properties .",
    "our numerical analysis indicates the existence of charged rotating black holes in @xmath11 dimensions , with @xmath0 , possessing a regular horizon of spherical topology and @xmath25 equal - magnitude angular momenta .",
    "these solutions represent the ads counterparts of asymptotically flat em solutions , discussed recently @xcite .",
    "this class of solutions may provide a fertile ground for further study of charged rotating configurations in gauged supergravity models .",
    "for @xmath4 there should be no difficulty in principle , using the techniques applied in @xcite , to extend these solutions to the general case with two distinct angular momenta .",
    "higher dimensional rotating em topological black holes with a horizon of negative curvature are also likely to exist for @xmath1 .",
    "the study of the solutions discussed in this paper in an ads / cft context represents an interesting open question .",
    "although this may require to embed them in a supergravity model , one should remark that for the ansatz considered here , the boundary metric is @xmath167 rotating and corresponds to a static einstein universe in @xmath168 dimensions .",
    "the background metric upon which the dual field theory resides is @xmath169 and corresponds to a @xmath85 static einstein universe with line element @xmath170 one can use the ads / cft `` dictionary '' to predict qualitative features of a quantum field theory in this background . for example , the expectation value of the dual cft stress - tensor can be calculated using the relation @xcite @xmath171 restricting to the five - dimensional case , one finds ( with @xmath172 ) the following interesting form for the stress - tensor @xmath173 where @xmath174 , @xmath175 . as expected , this stress - tensor is finite and covariantly conserved .",
    "it is also traceless as expected from the absence of a conformal anomaly for the static boundary metric ( [ b - metric ] ) @xcite .    from the ads / cft correspondence , we expect these black holes to be described by some thermal states in a dual theory , formulated in a static einstein universe",
    ". therefore it appears to be interesting to study the thermodynamics of charged rotating em solutions to see , how rotation affects the thermodynamic properties as compared to those of the static rn - ads solutions @xcite .",
    "this can already be attempted based on the numerical results presented in section 4 , valid for solutions with lorentzian signature .    a black hole as a thermodynamic system is unstable if it has negative specific heat . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the charge and angular momentum are fixed parameters , and the response function whose sign determines the thermodynamic stability is the heat capacity @xmath176 as is known , small schwarzschild - ads black holes ( @xmath113  @xmath177 ) have negative specific heat , but large size black holes have positive specific heat @xcite .",
    "there exists a discontinuity of the specific heat as a function of the temperature for some critical value of the horizon radius @xmath138 , and thus small and large black holes are found to be somewhat disjoint objects .",
    "the results here indicate that this discontinuity persists for charged rotating black holes in em theory , provided that the electric charge @xmath137 and the angular momentum @xmath141 are not very large .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "4 ( right ) , where the entropy @xmath178 of a set of @xmath4 em black holes is shown versus the temperature @xmath179 . for small values of @xmath137 and @xmath141",
    ", the entropy increases with increasing temperature up to a first critical point , from where it continues to increase with now decreasing temperature up to a second critical point , beyond which entropy and temperature both increase monotonically . for fixed @xmath141 , the region where @xmath180 shrinks , as @xmath137 is increased , and there exists a critical value of @xmath137 above which @xmath181 .",
    "the analogous pattern is seen for fixed @xmath137 and varying @xmath141 .",
    "thus the solutions become more thermally stable as @xmath137 and/or @xmath141 increase .",
