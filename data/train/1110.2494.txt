    "many problems in physics and optimization , such as describing quantum phases of matter or solving satisfiability , can be reduced to the computation of low - energy states of hamiltonians  ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "methods to compute such states exist , with adiabatic state transformation ( ast ) being one of the most acknowledged and powerful heuristics for that goal  @xcite .",
    "the problem in ast involves transforming a pure quantum state @xmath2 into @xmath3 ; these being the endpoints of a state path @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where each @xmath4 is an eigenstate of a hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "quantum strategies to solve the ast problem typically require evolving with the hamiltonians for time @xmath7 , which determines the cost of the method .",
    "a well - known example is given by the quantum adiabatic theorem and requires changing the interaction parameter @xmath8 sufficiently slowly in time  @xcite , but more efficient strategies exist  @xcite .",
    "when direct access to hamiltonian evolutions is not possible , such evolutions can be simulated in the standard quantum circuit model by means of trotter - suzuki - like formulas  @xcite . for these cases ,",
    "the cost of the method does not only depend on @xmath9 , but also depends on the additional cost of approximating fixed - time hamiltonian evolutions by quantum circuits .",
    "for this reason , it is standard to restrict to those @xmath6 whose fixed - time evolutions can be approximated by quantum circuits of small size ( e.g. , size bounded by constant - degree polynomials ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be the angular length determined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the spectral gap to the other nearest eigenvalue of @xmath6 .",
    "recently , we provided fast quantum methods for eigenpath traversal that do not exploit the structure of the hamiltonians and solve the ast problem in time @xmath13",
    "such methods were shown to be optimal in a black - box model  @xcite . however , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite do not forbid the existence of faster methods for solving the ast problem if additional knowledge about the structure of @xmath6 is available .",
    "our paper focuses on this observation and introduces the spectral gap amplification problem or gap .",
    "basically , we intend to answer : can we construct a hamiltonian @xmath14 that also has @xmath4 as eigenstate , but spectral gap @xmath15 ?",
    "when spectral gap amplification is possible , it can be used as a technique to find new quantum speedups in both , the hamiltonian - based model and the quantum circuit model . in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example , we constructed the so - called quantum simulated annealing algorithm that provided speedups of the well - known simulated annealing method implemented using monte - carlo .",
    "the reason for such speedups is a gap amplification step : if @xmath16 is the spectral gap of the stochastic matrix @xmath17 used in monte - carlo , there is a hamiltonian @xmath1 with spectral gap @xmath18 and eigenstate that allows to sample from the fixed point of @xmath17 . to build @xmath1 we used previously - developed tools for quantum walks  @xcite .    motivated by the results in refs .",
    "@xcite we study the gap in different scenarios .",
    "we first show that , for hamiltonians that satisfy a frustration - free property  @xcite , a quadratic spectral gap amplification is possible and _ optimal _ in some suitable black - box model .",
    "quadratic spectral gap amplification was previously known only for hamiltonians that result from a similarity transformation of stochastic matrices  @xcite .",
    "these hamiltonians , which are the so - called discriminants , are also stoquastic , i.e. the off - diagonal entries are non - positive .",
    "a direct consequence of our new construction is that spectral gap amplification can now be achieved for any frustration - free hamiltonian as those used in quantum adiabatic simulations of quantum circuits , improving upon the results in refs .",
    "the eigenstate in our construction is not the lowest - energy state of the hamiltonian induced by the quantum circuit ( which was the case in refs .",
    "nevertheless , techniques for ast work for any eigenstate and still apply to our case , giving more efficient quantum adiabatic simulations to prepare the circuit s output state . in addition , some low - energy eigenstates of general frustration - free hamiltonians ( termed peps ) were shown to play an important role in physics , renormalization , and optimization  @xcite : peps are useful variational states reproducing the local physics with high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "our method for spectral gap amplification can be used to speedup the preparation of peps on a quantum computer , with an expected improvement of other methods for this goal ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , it is hard to achieve spectral gap amplification for general hamiltonians that do not satisfy the frustration - free property",
    ". it would otherwise imply fast quantum methods for some problems , contradicting known complexity bounds in the oracle setting  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a natural generalization of our technique for spectral gap amplification would output a hermitian operator only if the input hamiltonian @xmath0 is semidefinite positive ( as is the case for frustration - free hamiltonians ) . such a generalization could then be used to solve the decision problem of whether a given @xmath0 is semidefinite positive or not ( with some small error bound ) , and provide an estimate to the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a complete problem for the class qma  @xcite , and finding its solution may require a quantum circuit of undesirably large size .",
    "the result on the impossibility of general spectral gap amplification has additional implications on the power of classical methods that solve the ast problem .",
    "for example , some stoquastic hamiltonians can be mapped to stochastic matrices through a similarity transformation  @xcite .",
    "the fixed point of the stochastic matrix coincides with the distribution induced by the ground state of the hamiltonian . the stochastic matrix would allow us to build a monte - carlo method to sample from the fixed point and classically solve the ast problem in this case . the same similarity transformation could then be used to give a frustration - free representation of the hamiltonian  @xcite , allowing us to use the results for frustration - free hamiltonians to amplify the gap .",
    "this contradicts the impossibility result , implying that finding the transformation is hard ( in the black - box setting ) .",
