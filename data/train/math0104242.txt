    "the goal of this paper is to discuss the properties of the so - called orbifold models of conformal field theory from the categorical point of view .    for readers convenience ,",

    "let @xmath7 be a voa and @xmath1  a finite group acting on @xmath7 by automorphisms .",
    "then the subspace of invariants @xmath8 is itself a voa .",
    "the main question is : is it possible to describe the category of @xmath8-modules in terms of the category of @xmath7-modules and the group @xmath1 ?",
    "this question was asked in this form in @xcite .",
    "they did nt give a full answer , but did suggest ( without a proof ) an answer in a special case , when @xmath7 is holomorphic , i.e. has only one simple module ( vacuum module ) .",
    "in this case , the category of representations of @xmath7 is equivalent to the category of vector spaces .",
    "the answer suggested in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite is that in this case , the category of @xmath8-modules is equivalent to the category of modules over the ( twisted ) drinfeld double @xmath5 of the group @xmath1 .",
    "the case of voa s coming from wess - zumino - witten model ( or , equivalently , from affine lie algebras ) was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "many of the results of @xcite were rigorously proved in the language of voa s in a series of papers of dong , li , and mason ; in particular , it is proved in @xcite that in the holomorphic case , @xmath7 considered as a module over both @xmath8 and @xmath1 can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are irreducible @xmath1-modules and @xmath11 are non - zero simple pairwise non - isomorphic @xmath8-modules . however , even in the holomorphic case the full result ( i.e. , that the category of @xmath8-modules is equivalent to the category of modules over the ( twisted ) drinfeld double @xmath5 ) is still not proved .",
    "in this paper we suggest a new approach to the problem .",
    "the main idea of this approach is * not * using the structure theory of voa s . in the author",
    "s opinion , all the information about voa s which is relevant for this problem is encoded in the category of representations of @xmath7 . for example , the pair @xmath12 can be described in this way : as discussed in @xcite , such a pair is the same as an associative commutative algebra in the category @xmath13 with some technical restrictions .",
    "thus , if we know some basic properties of @xmath14  e.g. , that this category is semisimple , braided , and rigid  then we can forget anything else about voa s , operator product expansions , etc .",
    "instead , we use well - known tools for working with braided tensor categories , such as graphical presentation of morphisms .    using this approach , in this paper we give an accurate proof of the above conjecture ; for simplicity , we only consider the case when all the `` twists '' , i.e. phase factors , are trivial . in this case",
    ", the main result reads as follows .",
