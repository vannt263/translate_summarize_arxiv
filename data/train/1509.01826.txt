    "in the late 1990s , it was shown @xcite that the mass modification of the particles in the hot and dense hadronic sources can lead to a squeezed back - to - back correlation ( bbc ) of boson - antiboson pairs in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this bbc caused by the interactions in medium is different from the pure quantum statistical correlations between the bosons with different isospins @xcite , which are negligible in high - energy heavy - ion collisions because the fourier transformation of source - density , @xmath6 , is very small even for the lightest meson @xcite .",
    "since it is associated with the source medium , the investigations of the bbc may possibly provide another way for people to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic sources formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , in addition to particle yields and spectra .",
    "the bbc function is defined as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the chaotic and squeezed amplitudes , respectively , @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the annihilation and creation operators of the free boson with momentum @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 , @xmath16 indicates the ensemble average . for a homogeneous source with volume @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 ,",
    "the bbc function can be written as @xcite @xmath19},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the coefficients of bogoliubov transformation between the creation ( annihilation ) operators of the quasiparticle in medium with modified mass @xmath22 and the free observed particle @xcite , @xmath23 is boson distribution , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the bbc function @xmath26 will be 1 if there is no mass modification .",
    "however , for a finite mass modification , @xmath27 , @xmath28 as @xmath29 , and the bbc function will increase with increasing particle momentum @xcite , @xmath30 .    for hydrodynamic sources , with the formula derived by makhlin and sinyukov @xcite , the chaotic and squeezed amplitudes can be expressed as @xcite @xmath31\\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32 \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the four - dimension element of freeze - out hypersurface , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the local - frame momentum corresponding to @xmath37 .",

    "@xcite ) .    in eq . ( [ gshydro ] ) , the factor @xmath41 is equal to @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "so the bbc function @xmath26 is sensitive to the temporal distribution of the freeze - out points @xcite .",
    "recent research @xcite indicates that the bbc functions for the hydrodynamic sources with gaussian initial - energy distributions exhibit oscillations as a function of the particle momentum because of the sharp falls of temporal freeze - out distributions at long times .",
    "investigating the bbc behavior and predicting its effect in high - energy heavy - ion collisions based on more realistic models is of great interest @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the bbc functions for the hydrodynamic sources with event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions ( fic ) .",

    "our investigation indicates that the bbc functions averaged over event - by - event calculations for many events for the hydrodynamic sources with the fic are smoothed and without the oscillations appearing in the bbc functions for the hydrodynamic sources with gaussian initial - energy distributions @xcite . for heavy - ion collisions at the rhic and lhc energies",

    "we use the ideal relativistic hydrodynamics in @xmath48 dimensions to describe the transverse expansion of the particle - emitting sources formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , and adopt the bjorken boost - invariant hypothesis @xcite for the longitudinal evolution of the sources .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of motion for the sources with zero net baryon density are from the local conservation of energy - momentum @xcite . under the assumption of bjorken longitudinal boost invariance , we need only to solve the transverse equations of motion in the @xmath49 plane @xcite , and the hydrodynamic solutions at @xmath50 can be obtained by the longitudinal boost invariance @xcite .    assuming the local equilibrium of system is reached at time @xmath51 , we construct the initial energy density of the hydrodynamic source at @xmath49 , by using the ampt code @xcite in which the hijing is used for generating the initial conditions , as @xcite @xmath52^{2 } + [ y - y_{\\alpha}(\\tau_{0 } ) ] ^2}{2\\pi\\sigma_0 ^ 2}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath53 is the transverse momentum of parton @xmath54 in the fluid element at @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the transverse coordinates of the parton at @xmath51 , @xmath58 is a transverse width parameter , and @xmath59 is a scale factor which can be adjusted to fit the experimental data of produced hadrons @xcite .",
    "the initial velocity of the fluid element is then determined by the initial energy density and the average transverse momentum of the partons in the element .    as in ref @xcite",
    ", we solve the hydrodynamic equations numerically by the hlle scheme and the sod s operation splitting method @xcite . in the calculations",
    ", we use the equation of state s95p - pce @xcite , which combines the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures and the lattice qcd results at high temperatures , and take the parameters @xmath60 fm , @xmath61 0.6 and 0.4 fm/@xmath62 for the heavy - ion collisions at the rhic and lhc , respectively . with these parameter values the hydrodynamic results of transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow of identical pion and charged hadrons are consistent with the experimental dada at the rhic and lhc @xcite .    for hydrodynamic sources with a bjorken cylinder , the four - dimension element of freeze - out hypersurface can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the proper time , transverse coordinate , and space - time rapidity of the element .",

    "this is because the oscillations in the single - event bbc functions are canceled each other in the bbc functions averaged over event - by - event calculations for many events . from fig .",
    "[ bbcfp_rl ] one can see that the bbc functions for peripheral collisions are larger than those for central collisions .",

    "so , the values of the bbc function are mainly related to the source temporal distribution , particle mass , mass shift , and source temperature . because we use the same freeze - out temperature for @xmath47 meson in the calculations for the collisions with different centralities and energies , the main reason of the dependences of the @xmath47 bbc function on the collision centrality and energy ( see fig .",
