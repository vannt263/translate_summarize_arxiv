    "the failure of the effective mass approximation is also seen through the first excitation energies deviating from @xmath108 as @xmath12 is increased ( figure [ fig : appendix1]a ) .    for larger @xmath12 , as a function of the interaction strength @xmath35 , the breathing frequency ( figure [ fig : appendix1]c ) decreases to @xmath113 as @xmath35 is increased up to @xmath114 . at stronger interactions ,",
    "the breathing frequency _ decreases _ further , unlike the continuum or small @xmath12 situations .",
    "this can be understood in the large @xmath35 ( free fermion ) limit : since the single - particle spectrum is dense for @xmath115 ( figure [ fig : appendix1]a ) , the difference between the @xmath0-th and @xmath44-th levels levels is smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "there is an interesting plateau at @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) which is difficult to explain from single - particle considerations .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of breathing modes for bosons on a tight - binding finite chain subject to a harmonic trap , and repulsively interacting through on - site interactions , as described by the 1d bose - hubbard model .",
    "we have used exact numerical diagonalization to treat up to 7 bosons , and used the excitation spectrum , overlaps after a quench , and explicit time evolution , to clarify various aspects of the problem .",
    "the continuum calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite are similar in spirit .",
    "in addition to connecting to the continuum limit , we have also highlighted deviations from this limit .",
    "as in the continuum , the breathing mode frequency turns out to be the excitation energy of the lowest excited reflection - symmetric state .",
    "this is twice the trapping frequency , @xmath36 , at small and large interactions , and it decreases to around @xmath27 at intermediate @xmath35 .",
    "there are various lattice corrections to this continuum picture , which we have examined in the text , even for strong traps ( section [ sec : strongtrap ] ) .",
    "our results raise various open questions .",
    "most prominent is the failure of the time - dependent gutzwiller approximation to describe the breathing mode frequency at larger @xmath35 ( section [ sec : gutzwiller ] ) . since this is a popular method for time evolution of bose - hubbard systems @xcite , it is important to understand regimes and situations where it fails .",
    "our results of figure [ fig : edgutz ] should serve as a benchmark in further understanding of this issue .",
    "it is possible to excite breathing modes through quenches of the on - site interaction @xmath35 .",
    "while we expect essential features to be similar , it would be interesting to compare especially the overlap profiles analogous to figures [ fig : overlaps_n567 ] for the trap quench .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to low - density situations where mott physics does not play a role .",
    "clearly , dynamics in the presence of one or multiple mott cores is an intriguing direction of study , especially if it is possible to go beyond gutzwiller dynamics .",
