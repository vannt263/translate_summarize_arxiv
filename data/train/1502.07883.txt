    "acoustic liners are widely used to reduce the sound transmission in ducts with flow with applications in household appliances , ventilation systems in vehicles and buildings , ic - engines , power plants , aircraft engine .",
    "the mitigation due to these liners is based on two principles that are generally mixed .",
    "the first action of the liners is to dissipate acoustical energy by visco - thermal losses or by exchange of energy between the acoustical field and flow , like in the vicinity of a hole in a perforated plate with grazing flow .",
    "the second type of action is the scattering of the acoustical waves by the changes of acoustical impedance occurring for instance at the entrance and at the exit of the liners .",
    "this paper focusses on the second type of action called reacting effects and disregards the first type called dissipative effects . to do this ,",
    "a waveguide with an acoustically treated wall is studied and the wall is considered as locally reacting and without dissipation . when the liner consists of cavities mounted flush to the wall ( like small closed tubes in the present case ) , those cavities act as springs in the low frequencies limit .",
    "then , the speed of sound is determined by the square root of the ratio between the isentropic bulk modulus ( which is a measure for the `` stiffness '' of the fluid ) and the `` mass '' density .",
    "the presence of small cavities decreases the effective stiffness and , consequently , the speed of sound .",
    "the propagative acoustical waves in such systems are called `` slow sound '' . recently",
    ", slow acoustic waves have attracted attention for the potential to design new acoustic devices such as metamaterials .",
    "they have been studied both in sonic crystals@xcite and in one dimensional system@xcite .",
    "the originality of the present study is to introduce a mean flow with a velocity of the same order as the effective speed of sound . when the flow velocity is smaller than the speed of sound the regime is called `` subsonic '' and `` supersonic '' on the other case .",
    "in the subsonic regime , it will be shown that 4 modes propagate at low frequencies ( wavelength much smaller than the transverse dimensions of the waveguide ) .",
    "two of these modes correspond to classical acoustical waves in both direction .",
    "the two other modes do not exist without flow and are thus called hydrodynamic ( hd ) modes in the following .",
    "one of these hd modes has a group velocity and a phase velocity in opposite direction .",
    "the second hd mode is a negative energy wave ( new ) .",
    "globally , among the 4 modes that propagate in the subsonic regime , 3 of the modes propagate in the flow direction while one of the acoustical modes propagates against the flow . in the supersonic regime , only 2 waves can propagate and they are in the flow direction .",
    "the problem that we consider is close to the response of fluid loaded finite plates with mean flow @xcite but it leads to a simpler analysis of interesting behaviors .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the section [ sect2 ] of this paper is devoted to the characterization of the modes propagating in the low frequencies limit in a 2d duct .",
    "it will be shown that an energy flux conservation can be written in this case .",
    "the section [ sect3 ] describes a approximate 1d model where the effects in the transverse direction of the duct are taken into account by averaging .",
    "albeit very simple , this 1d model has the same richness of behavior as the 2d model . in particular , as in the 2d model , an energy flux conservation is obtained and a new is present . in the section [ sect4 ] , the 1d model is used to calculate the scattering proprieties of an increase or a decrease in the wall impedance .",
    "the transonic cases ( from supersonic to subsonic and vice versa ) are of particular interest because of the conversion of acoustical waves into hd modes . a local transonic increase of the compliance is also studied in the section [ sect5 ] and shows an interesting propriety of total transmission in flow direction and of no transmission in the opposite direction corresponding to an `` acoustical diode '' .",

    "we consider the sound propagation in a 2d channel with a uniform flow , see fig .",
    "the lower wall is rigid .",
    "the upper wall is compliant and composed of small tubes of variable lengths .",

    ", we use the so - called `` ingard - myers condition '' @xcite .",
    "this condition states that the pressure and the transverse displacement @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are continuous at the wall which leads to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the compliance of the wall ( ratio of transverse displacement over the pressure ) .",
    "hence the boundary condition at the wall @xmath20 is written : @xmath21    the compliance of the closed tubes of length @xmath22 at @xmath20 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the percentage of open area ( poa , ratio between the surface of the tubes and the total surface ) . in the very low frequencies limit ( @xmath25 ) , the compliance is simply equal to the length of the tubes @xmath22 multiply by the poa .",
    "it means that in this limit , the closed tubes act like springs of stiffness @xmath26 .",
    "to simplify the notation in the following @xmath24 is suppose to be equal to unity ( it could be integrated very easily if it differs significantly from unity ) and the problem can be written globally as    @xmath27    the impedance boundary condition with uniform flow is questionable@xcite and more advanced models exist @xcite .",
    "the ingard - myers condition has been used here for simplicity . in the low frequencies",

    "the phase velocity @xmath35 is always smaller than 1 , meaning that @xmath36 is smaller than the speed of sound in free space .",
