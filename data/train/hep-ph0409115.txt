    "inclusive decays of @xmath0 mesons into final states containing light particles , such as @xmath2 and @xmath5 , play a prominent role in the extraction of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath6 and in searches for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "necessary experimental cuts in the analysis of these processes restrict the hadronic final state to have large energy , @xmath7 , but only moderate invariant mass , @xmath8 . in this region of phase space",
    ", the inclusive rates can be calculated using a twist expansion , which resums infinite sets of power corrections into non - perturbative shape functions @xcite .",
    "the impressive performance of the babar , belle , and cleo experiments demands a continuous effort to reduce the theoretical uncertainties affecting extractions of @xmath6 using inclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made by systematically incorporating higher - order perturbative corrections @xcite .",
    "a careful estimate of the theoretical uncertainty on @xmath6 , extracted using a cut on @xmath9 , finds an error of 7% due to variations of the leading shape function @xcite , which can be reduced significantly using information on the @xmath5 photon spectrum . with a 5% relative theoretical error on @xmath6 ,",
    "corrections suppressed by a power of @xmath10 are considered the second largest source of uncertainty .",

    "an intermediate `` hard - collinear '' scale @xmath25 set by the typical invariant mass of the hadronic final state is of relevance .",
    "because quantum fluctuations associated with the hard and hard - collinear scales can be treated in perturbation theory , the hadronic tensor trivially factorizes into products of hard functions @xmath26 ) , jet functions @xmath27 ) , and shape functions defined in terms of @xmath0-meson matrix elements of quark - gluon operators . in a first step ,",
    "hard fluctuations are integrated out by matching the qcd currents onto soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",

    "returning to the case of the four - quark operator in ( [ o5 ] ) , we note that its contribution vanishes in the vacuum - insertion approximation due to the color - octet structure of the heavy - light quark bilinears . while this approximation is admittedly naive , phenomenological evidence based on studies of @xmath0-meson lifetimes @xcite and theoretical arguments based on lattice calculations @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite support the notion that matrix elements which vanish in the vacuum - insertion approximation are numerically suppressed , typically by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is thus very unlikely that the four - quark operator in ( [ o5 ] ) could give a larger contribution than loop - suppressed @xmath1 corrections , which we have neglected .",

    "note also that the hadronic invariant mass distribution receives fractional power corrections of order @xmath301 with @xmath302 from a region of phase space where the collinear expansion breaks down @xcite . while these effects are formally beyond the accuracy of the present work , they introduce an additional theoretical uncertainty that is difficult to quantify ( unless they can be shown to cancel ) .    the smallness of subleading shape - function effects for some observables can be understood based on the moment expansions in ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath255 spectrum ( [ ppl ] ) the first moments of the functions @xmath303 and @xmath304 cancel in the combination @xmath305 , and the first moment of @xmath306 cancels against that of @xmath307 , leaving a small residual term @xmath308 . in weighted integrals over the @xmath255 spectrum , this can give rise to small second - order power corrections .",
    "higher moments may spoil these cancellations , but their effects are only of order @xmath193 or higher when the spectrum is integrated over a sufficiently large domain .",
    "similar cancellations occur for the hadronic invariant mass spectrum ( [ sh ] ) , and for the photon spectrum ( [ photon ] ) , for which the first moments cancel entirely . in all three cases ,",
    "we have checked that taking a mix of the two models for the subleading shape functions , in which different higher moments prevent perfect cancellations , does not change the results by a significant amount .",
    "the case of the charged - lepton spectrum ( [ el ] ) is again different .",
    "the first moment of @xmath309 cancels against that of @xmath310 .",
    "however , the sum @xmath311 has a rather large first moment given by @xmath312 , which in conjunction with the linear weight factor in ( [ fe ] ) gives rise to a significant power correction to the event fraction @xmath313 @xcite .",
    "with the development of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) , theoretical predictions for inclusive @xmath0-meson decay distributions have recently received renewed attention . while these processes had been studied extensively during the past decade , the ever increasing precision of the measurements at the @xmath0 factories requires a new level of accuracy .",
    "this is an area where scet is not only a useful conceptual tool , but where it provides concrete means of pushing the limits of theoretical calculations .",

    "the behavior of the leading shape function under renormalization is now well understood .",
    "this leaves power corrections to the heavy - quark limit as the principal source of theoretical uncertainties .    in the present work ,",
    "we have used the formalism of scet to perform a systematic study of such power - suppressed effects . at tree level ,",
    "the results can be expressed in terms of a set of subleading shape functions defined via the fourier transforms of forward matrix elements of bi - local light - cone operators in heavy - quark effective theory .",
    "we have identified a new contribution arising from four - quark operators , which was not considered previously .",
    "we have shown that , when shape functions appearing in process - independent combinations are combined into single functions , then a total of three subleading shape functions are required to describe arbitrary current - induced decay distributions of @xmath0 mesons into light final - state particles .",
    "while subleading shape - function effects had been studied in the past , our results do not agree with those found in the original papers @xcite .    in the last part of this work",

    "<S> the contributions of subleading shape functions to inclusive decay distributions of @xmath0 mesons are derived from a systematic two - step matching of qcd current correlators onto soft - collinear and heavy - quark effective theory . at tree - level , the results can be expressed in terms of forward matrix elements of bi - local light - cone operators . </S>",
    "<S> four - quark operators , which arise at @xmath1 , are included . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in disagreement with some previous studies of subleading shape - function effects . </S>",
