    "quantum fluctuations in the light field observables have been a subject of intensive and maintained research since the appearance of quantum optics in the early sixties , especially since the discovery of the nonclassical states of light and the generation of squeezed light in the mid eighties drummond04 .",
    "quantum fluctuations are unavoidable as their origin lies in the impossibility of determining two canonically conjugate observables with a precision better than that allowed by the heisenberg uncertainty relations . in the case of the radiation field , quantum fluctuations manifest in quantities such as the photon number , the field phase , the stokes parameters , or the field quadratures loudon87,meystre91,korolkova02,dodonov03,walls94 .",
    "although its origin could be traced back till the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite , the modern squeezing research goes back to the mid seventies , its foundational period being closed with the experimental generation of squeezed light in the mid eighties @xcite . in a single  mode state the two field quadratures ( equivalent to the position and momentum operators of a harmonic oscillator ) constitute a canonically conjugate pair , the product of their uncertainties being consequently limited by the heisenberg inequality .",
    "when the field mode is in a coherent state , the uncertainty is the same for any field quadrature and equals that of the vacuum state .",
    "then , a squeezed state is that for which the uncertainty in a particular field quadrature is smaller than that of the quantum vacuum , a reduction achieved at the expense of an increase in the uncertainty of the complementary field quadrature .",
    "these states can be generated in nonlinear processes ( four - wave mixing , parametric down - conversion ... ) , and the field quadratures can be detected in a homodyne detection experiment in which the quantum state is mixed with a classical ( intense , coherent ) local oscillator field @xcite .",
    "single - mode squeezing has been intensively and extensively investigated for almost three decades @xcite .",
    "a well established result is that a high degree of squeezing is obtained in nonlinear cavities near the bifurcation points , and that the squeezing level degrades as the system is brought far from them @xcite .",
    "multimode squeezing has also been considered in the past .",
    "one of the most immediate cases is that of nonlinear cavities working in several longitudinal modes , a type of system already exhibiting noise reduction features specific to multimode systems .",
    "for example , the quantum noise suppression on the difference of intensities ( amplitude - squeezing ) of a two  mode optical parametric oscillator above threshold @xcite , which is associated to the existence of a continuous diffusion of the phase difference between the two modes .",
    "it is to be remarked that squeezing appears in this case associated to a _ collective variable _ , namely the intensity difference , and that , remarkably , the noise reduction level is independent of the system proximity to a bifurcation point .",
    "a particularly interesting case of multimode squeezing is that of solitons . squeezing in optical fibre solitons ( _ temporal _ solitons )",
    "has attracted much interest since the late eighties @xcite and is by now quite well understood , see e.g. @xcite for a recent review . in this problem",
    "the relevance of collective variables , such as the position or the momentum of the soliton , is very clear in the sense that these are the observables in which the behavior of quantum fluctuations is easily detectable .",
    "as we comment below , this problem has some similarities , but also strong differences ,  with the problem of cavity solitons that we treat here . a related problem , that of the squeezing of spatial solitons in kerr media , has also been considered recently treps00,lantz04,nagasako98,mecozzi98 .    for our purposes ,",
    "a most exciting connection is that existing between pattern formation in nonlinear optical cavities and squeezing lugiato99,lugiato02 . in these systems",
    "the concepts used in the analysis of quantum fluctuations , which has started relatively recently , must be generalized to cover correlations at different spatial points kolobov99 .",
    "extended nonlinear optical systems , specially nonlinear optical cavities with large fresnel numbers , are systems that spontaneously display dissipative structures , which are extended patterns that form in the plane orthogonal to the light propagation direction , through an spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "one of the new concepts that appeared when the analysis of quantum fluctuations in these systems was addressed is the quantum image @xcite , which can be described as a precursor appearing below threshold of the pattern that the system would display above threshold .",
    "the quantum image is not detectable at low observation frequencies as in this case the fast dynamics of quantum fluctuations is washed out .",
    "we refer the reader to existing reviews for a resume of the main researches in the field @xcite . for our purposes , which concern the analysis of the squeezing in dissipative structures ,",
    "the work carried out by gatti and lugiato @xcite on the squeezing of extended degenerate optical parametric oscillators ( dopo ) below threshold , is particularly close ( see also @xcite ) , as well as the analysis of the role played by the goldstone mode in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate quantum fluctuations of dissipative structures in the dopo . in a first part",
    "we develop the theory for the calculation of linearized quantum fluctuations , in particular for the calculation of the squeezing and intensity fluctuations spectra .",
    "the theory is general in the sense that no particular dissipative structure is assumed .",
    "moreover , although the model for a dopo in the large pump detuning is used , the derived expressions are easily generalizable to cover other nonlinear cavity models .",
    "then , in a second part we apply this theory to the study of the squeezing properties of a special dissipative structure appearing above threshold , the so  called bright cavity soliton .",
    "in @xcite we already advanced a particular property of quantum fluctuations which is specific to pattern formation ( i.e. , that is absent when the emission is homogeneous in space ) , which can be put in short as follows :  due to the translational invariance of the problem ( the position of the pattern in the transverse plane is not fixed when the pumping is spatially homogeneous ) , there is a particular transverse mode that is free from quantum fluctuations ( in the linear approximation ) , a _",
    "perfectly _ squeezed _ _  _ _ mode . and this occurs irrespectively of the value of the parameters of the system .",
    "the only conditions are that ( i ) the system be translational invariant , and ( ii )  that the output field displays a pattern .",
    "this particular mode corresponds to the transverse linear momentum of the pattern .",
    "here we shall go beyond this result by studying the squeezing properties of a special pattern , the bright cavity soliton .",
    "for that we shall consider the dopo  model in the large pump detuning limit , as the problem is much simpler in these conditions because there exists an explicit analytical solution for the localized structure .",
    "as stated , the article consists of two parts . in the first part ( covering sections ii to v ) we derive general expressions for the study of quantum fluctuations ( e.g. , the linear squeezing spectrum ) without specializing to any particular pattern",
    "then , the second part ( section vi ) is devoted to the bright cavity soliton .",
    "finally , in section vii we give our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the general method that will allow us determining quantities related with the quantum fluctuations of optical dissipative structures ( e.g. the squeezing spectrum ) in the linear approximation .",
    "an outstanding feature of the method is that it circumvents the numerical integration of the dynamical , stochastic equations , which is always a problematic ( and terribly time consuming ) task .",
    "instead , the method exploits the diagonalization of the linear problem , which allows simplest formal solutions .",
    "we shall use the dopo  with plane cavity mirrors as a model for presenting the method . any other nonlinear optical cavity with plane mirrors sustaining dissipative structures",
    "can be studied along similar ways after straightforward particularization of the expressions given below .",
    "we assume that the dynamical equations of the studied system have been cast in the form of classical - looking langevin equations corresponding to some coherent state representation .",
    "in particular we assume that a generalized @xmath0 representation @xcite is being used ( sec .",
    "ii.a ) as its normal ordering equivalence allows a direct computation of measurable quantities corresponding to the fields leaving the cavity .",
    "furthermore we assume that those langevin equations have been linearized around a classical dissipative structure ( sec .",
    "the method consists in separating the fluctuations in two classes : ( i ) those coming from the drift of the dissipative structure , as it can move freely across the transverse section owed to the spatial translation invariance of the model ( sec .",
    "ii.c ) ; and ( ii ) formally solving the equations corresponding to the remaining ( `` internal '' ) fluctuations making use of a special basis ( sec .",
    "ii.d ) , what allows deriving a general expression for the linearized squeezing spectrum ( sec .",
    "iii ) , as well as for the spectrum of intensity fluctuations ( sec .",
    "this section ends with a general result concerning the squeezing of dissipative structures ( sec .",
    "we consider the model for a type i dopo  with plane cavity mirrors of gatti97 pumped by a plane wave coherent field of frequency @xmath1 and amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "an intracavity @xmath3 nonlinear crystal converts pump photons into subharmonic photons , at frequency @xmath4 , and vice versa . only two longitudinal cavity modes , of frequencies @xmath5 ( pump mode ) and @xmath6(signal mode ) , which are the closest to @xmath7 and @xmath4 , respectively ,",
    "are assumed to be relevant .",
    "the cavity is assumed to be single - ended , i.e. , losses occur at a single cavity mirror , where the intracavity modes are damped at rates @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the above frequencies define dimensionless pump and signal detuning parameters through @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we denote the intracavity field envelope operators for pump and signal modes , which propagate along the @xmath12 direction , by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , where * *  * * @xmath15 is the transverse position vector , obeying standard equal - time commutation relations@xmath16 = \\delta_{m , n}\\delta\\left ( \\mathbf{r}-% \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{commutationrel}\\ ] ]    as commented we shall use a coherent state representation in order to handle the problem .",
    "these representations set a correspondence between the quantum operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the c - number fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , which are independent but in their ( stochastic ) averages , which verify @xmath21 .",
    "the physical meaning of the stochastic average of any function of the c - number fields depends on the representation .",
    "in particular we shall use the generalized @xmath0 representation @xcite , generalized to include the spatial nature of the multimode problem here considered @xcite , in which the stochastic averages correspond to quantum expectation values computed in normal and time ordering .",
    "as shown in appendix a , in the large pump detuning limit ( @xmath22 ) the dopo dynamical ( langevin ) equations in the generalized @xmath0 representation can be written as    [ adiabaticlangevin ] @xmath23where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the diffraction length for the signal field , @xmath26 is the transverse laplacian operator , and we have introduced the real and dimensionless parametric pump parameter @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the ( real ) nonlinear coupling coefficient , eq .",

    "these ds are patterns that appear in the transverse plane with respect to the direction of light propagation .",
    "we denote these ( steady ) structures by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is arbitrary due to the translation invariance of the problem .",
    "they can be , e. g. , periodic patterns or localized structures longhi95,longhi97,bondila95,barashenkov02,devalcarcel02 .",
    "although in the second part of this paper we shall concentrate on a particular type of ds , namely the bright cavity soliton , we stress here that the treatment we present below is completely general and covers the description of quantum fluctuations of any stationary ds .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum fluctuations around any ds is studied by setting    [ classicalsolution ] @xmath41 where @xmath42and @xmath43 are the classical stationary mean values of the field corresponding to a particular ds ( i.e. , the stationary solutions of eqs .",

( in the second part of this article we show that this is indeed the case for the bright cavity soliton solution , unlike the problem of conservative temporal solitons where the set of eigenvectors must be completed in order to form a proper basis @xcite ) .",
    "the method used to solve eq .",
    "( [ linearizedlangevin ] ) consists in expanding the quantum fluctuations in this biorthonormal basis .",

    "however , it will be convenient for our purposes to state two general properties of the discrete spectra .",

    "remarkably , in our case there exists always two null eigenvalues , which are associated with the goldstone modes ( see property 1 in subsection ii c ) .",
    "nevertheless these null eigenvalues do not make the linear approach invalid as the undamped fluctuations do not concern any particular field mode but the position of the dissipative structure , which is decoupled from the rest of fluctuations and undergoes a continuous diffusion ( as it occurs , e.g. , with the phase difference in @xcite ) .",
    "numerical research carried out in vectorial kerr cavities @xcite reinforce this confidence . in resume :  in spite of having a null eigenvalue , we can be confident that the linearized description of quantum fluctuations will be reasonably accurate , and that a nonlinear treatment @xcite will not lead to dramatically different results .",
    "in this second part of the article , we study in detail the squeezing properties of the dopo  bright cavity soliton in the large pump detuning limit .",
    "first , in subsection vi.a we review the main properties of this solution and then , in subsection vi.b , we apply the theory developed in the first part to it . for the sake of simplicity we shall consider in this second part only the one  dimensional case ,",
    "that is , we assume that the dopo works embedded in a waveguide that avoids diffraction in the @xmath199 transverse dimension whilst in the @xmath200 transverse dimension the system aperture is arbitrarily large .",
    "moreover , we shall assume from now on that the lof used in the homodyne detection scheme can be moved , in the transverse dimension , in such a way that its movement exactly matches the diffusive motion of the bright cavity soliton , and thus we shall not take into account the diffusive motion of the ds ( see @xcite for a quantitative discussion in which we show that this is a reasonable assumption ) .      as stated in subsection ii.a , in the limit of large pump detuning we are considering here , the classical description of the dopo is the pdnlse , ( eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticlangevinclassic ] ) in appendix b ) .",
    "it is well known that the one  dimensional pdnlse supports two different types of localized structures ( cavity solitons in our context ) : dark cavity solitons ( tanh  type localized structures ) in the self - defocusing case @xmath201 , and bright  cavity solitons ( sech  type localized structures ) in the self - focusing case @xmath202 @xcite .",
    "we shall treat in the following the bright cavity soliton and thus we take @xmath203 .    before going on",
    "we find it convenient to review the main solutions of the pdnlse .",
    "this equation has only two free parameters ( the parametric pump parameter @xmath27 and the cavity detuning @xmath204 ) as the rest of parameters ( @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 ) can be easily removed by normalizing the time and space coordinates as well as the field amplitude ( see eq .",
    "( [ pdnlse ] ) in appendix b ) . when @xmath208 , the trivial state , @xmath209 , undergoes a supercritical bifurcation towards a patterned state ( a roll , or stripe , pattern ) at @xmath210 .",
    "contrarily , when @xmath211 the bifurcation affecting the trivial state is subcritical and occurs at @xmath212 . for @xmath213 , and positive @xmath204",
    ", dynamic patterns are found @xcite .",
    "the bright cavity soliton has the explicit expression@xmath214with    [ solitonspgle ] @xmath215this solution exists for @xmath211 and @xmath216 alexeeva99 , and is stable in a wide domain of parameters , although for large enough @xmath204 it becomes unstable , through a hopf bifurcation , thus appearing temporal oscillations ( self - pulsing solitons ) @xcite .",
    "then the bright cavity soliton can undergo three different bifurcations : ( i ) a tangent bifurcation at @xmath210 ( the bs does not exist for @xmath217 ) , ( ii ) a bifurcation at @xmath218 ( the bs does not exist for @xmath219 ) , and ( iii ) a hopf bifurcation for large enough @xmath204 that transforms the stationary bs into a self  pulsing bs . in fig .",
    "1 we represent in the @xmath220 plane the domains of existence of the different solutions we have just commented .",
    "it is convenient to briefly comment here on the similarities between the bright cavity soliton and the temporal soliton of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "the nlse is a conservative equation that can be written without free parameters .",
    "then , there is a family of sech  type solitons , that coexist , and for which certain quantities ( such as the energy ) are conserved .",
    "this is very different from the pdnlse which is a nonconservative equation governed by two parameters . for given @xmath221 and @xmath222 ,",
    "the sech  type solution is unique and can be stable or unstable .",
    "in fact the bright cavity soliton is not a true soliton and its name can be misleading when comparisons between these similar but actually quite different equations ( nlse and pdnlse ) are made . in particular , these differences manifest in the spectra of @xmath54 and@xmath223 .",
    "we have shown that in order to calculate the squeezing spectrum , given by eq .",
    "( [ specsum ] ) , one needs to evaluate the spectra ( [ eigensystem ] ) of both @xmath54 and@xmath224 ( [ linearoperator ] ) for @xmath225 , eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath54 in this case has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "it consists of a continuous spectrum , with eigenvalues of the form    @xmath226    and of a discrete spectrum with eigenvalues @xmath227 .",
    "the spectra of @xmath54 and@xmath224 need to be computed numerically , as analytical expressions can not be derived in general , which we have done by adapting the fourier method described in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some eigenvectors of the discrete spectrum can be computed analytically for some parameter sets . in particular , we have derived the four eigenvectors corresponding to the bifurcation occurring at @xmath210 .",
    "these eigenvectors are explicitly given in appendix b.    a crucial point is whether the set of eigenvectors of @xmath54 and@xmath228 form a ( biorthonormal ) basis or not .",
    "we commented above that for the similar problem of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , describing temporal fiber solitons , the set of eigenvectors of @xmath54 and@xmath223 do not form a base @xcite .",
    "as in our case analytical expressions are not available , our strategy has consisted in discretizing the transverse spatial coordinate and numerically diagonalize @xmath229 and@xmath223 .",
    "our numerical results show that the number of independent eigenvectors coincides with the dimension of the matrices , what constitutes a numerical proof that for this particular transverse pattern , the eigenvectors of @xmath54 and@xmath230 form a ( biorthonormal ) basis , whereas this does not happen in the conservative case .",
    "we see that the nlse and the pdnlse are very different problems indeed .",
    "now we are in conditions for studying the squeezing properties of the dopobright cavity soliton .",
    "of course the amount of squeezing to be obtained will depend on the local oscillator field ( lof ) one uses in the homodyne measurements and , in general , on the parameter values ( pump and detuning ) .",
    "we shall proceed in our study as follows : first , in subsection vi.b.1 , we shall particularize the general result obtained in @xcite and derived above in section iii for the bright cavity soliton . then , in subsection vi.b.2 , we shall consider the squeezing at the bifurcation points ( which have been discussed in subection vi.a ) .",
    "finally , in subsection vi.b.3 we shall consider the case of a plane  wave lof .",
    "in this last case we discuss first how the amount of squeezing changes with the parameters ( for arbitrarily large detectors ) , and then how the level of squeezing depends on the size of the photodetectors when these have a finite transverse dimension .      in section",
    "vi we showed that there is a special mode that is perfectly squeezed in the linear approximation , which is equivalent to saying that the transverse linear momentum of the ds is perfectly squeezed .",
    "we saw that the fluctuations of this mode are detected by choosing the lof @xmath231 , that is , @xmath232 , see eq.([lofmagic ] ) . in fig .",
    "2 we represent the amplitude of this lof with a dashed line together with the soliton amplitude , given by eq .",
    "( as the phase factor @xmath233 is space independent , eq . ( [ bs ] ) , it has been discarded in making this plot . )",
    "the similarity between @xmath234 and the gauss ",
    "hermite function    @xmath235    is immediate ( in fig .",
    "2 the gauss ",
    "hermite function is also plotted ) , what suggests the use of this function , which is relatively easy to generate , as a lof . in order to calculate the level of squeezing that would be detected by using the gauss ",
    "hermite lof , eq . ( [ gh ] ) , we take advantage of the general theory presented in the first part of this article :  we expand the lof on the basis of @xmath60 as@xmath236excluding the goldstone modes , and the squeezing spectrum is given by@xmath237where the modal correlation matrix , eq.([modalspectrum ] ) , is evaluated from the computed spectra of @xmath54 and@xmath224 .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical method was checked by computing @xmath238 when @xmath239 , yielding an error less than @xmath240 .",
    "the influence of the gauss ",
    "hermite lof width and position was already presented in @xcite , and we reproduce it in fig . 3 for the sake of completitude .",
    "notice that the level of squeezing is quite large even when the lof position or width are not well matched to those of mode @xmath241 .      at the bifurcations points there is , at least , one null eigenvalue , apart from that corresponding to the goldstone mode .",
    "this implies the existence of a mode , different to @xmath241 , whose eigenvalue reaches its minimum value .",
    "this mode is expected to be perfectly squeezed in the linear approximation .",
    "the squeezing of these modes is the equivalent to the usual squeezing at the bifurcation points that has been repeatedly studied in a large number of nonlinear cavities @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the bright cavity soliton can undergo three different bifurcations at @xmath242 , @xmath243 , and @xmath244 , see fig .",
    "let us consider first the bifurcation occurring at @xmath242 ( the analytic expression of the mode that has @xmath245 is given in the appendix b , mode @xmath246 ) .",
    "then , by taking @xmath247 , one obtains the squeezing spectra that we have represented in fig . 4 for @xmath248 and three values of @xmath221 .",
    "notice that @xmath249 for @xmath242 ( full line ) ; for @xmath250 ( dashed line ) the maximum squeezing does not reach @xmath251 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath221 departs from unity the maximum squeezing does not occur at @xmath195 , but at a slightly different frequency .",
    "for @xmath252 , the maximum level of squeezing is close to @xmath253 .",
    "that is , the squeezing degrades quickly as the system departs from this bifurcation .",
    "a similar behavior is exhibited at the bifurcation occurring at @xmath254 and we shall not enter into quantitative details .",
    "let us finally consider the hopf bifurcation . for @xmath255",
    "there are two eigenmodes , let us denote them as @xmath256 and @xmath257 , for which the eigenvalues read @xmath258 @xmath259 ( @xmath260 is the oscillation frequency at the hopf bifurcation ) , i.e. , there are two most damped eigenmodes which are expected to exhibit maximum squeezing .",
    "but in the hopf bifurcation there can not be a lof that matches these squeezed modes : remind that the lof vector was defined as @xmath261 , and at the hopf bifurcation the eigenvectors with re @xmath262 , @xmath263 , do not verify @xmath264 .",
    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "5 where we have represented the imaginary parts of @xmath265 and @xmath266 ( also the real parts , not shown , are quite different ) .",
    "this fact makes it impossible to find a lof such that @xmath267",
    ". then perfect noise reduction is never achieved at the hopf bifurcation .    the amount of squeezing attainable at the hopf bifurcation is represented in fig .",
    "6 where the squeezing spectrum has been represented for two choices of the lof : @xmath268 , in dashed line , and @xmath269 , in full line .",
    "interestingly the maximum squeezing is larger for the latter choice .",
    "notice also that , in contrast to the other bifurcations and as it is well known , at the hopf bifurcation the maximum level of squeezing is reached at a frequency different from @xmath270 , which corresponds to the self - pulsing frequency of the bright cavity soliton .",
    "we consider now the particular case of the squeezing properties of the bright cavity soliton when measured in a homodyning experiment , probed with a plane - wave lof , which is of obvious relevant interest as this is the simplest lof .    at a first stage we deal , as in the preceding subsections , with a complete beam detection ,",
    "that is , the detector is assumed to completely cover the transverse extension of the outgoing quantum cavity soliton .",
    "7 shows the squeezing spectra obtained for five different values of the pump @xmath27 and @xmath271 .",
    "the maximum of squeezing is achieved at frequency @xmath272 irrespective of the pump value ( which is obviously limited to @xmath273 @xmath274 @xmath275 , see fig .",
    "1 ) . a high degree of squeezing , sustained for a large range of parameters setting , is obtained .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the inset of fig .",
    "7 , where @xmath276 is depicted as a function of pump for @xmath271 .",
    "we have also calculated the influence of the detuning : in fig .",
    "8 we plot the same as in fig . 7 but for fixed @xmath277 and as a function of detuning @xmath278 .",
    "again large squeezing levels are obtained in all the domain of existence of the cavity soliton ( for detunings larger than those represented in fig .",
    "8 , the cavity soliton becomes hopf unstable as already commented ) .",
    "we focus now on the homodyning detection when using finite size detectors .",
    "when a detector , with size @xmath150 and positioned at @xmath279 is used , the squeezing spectrum detected is given by eq .",
    "( [ spatials ] ) , particularized to the bs solution . in the particular case of a plane - wave lof ,",
    "the calculations are considerably simplified , as @xmath280 is constant .",
    "we note , as well , that the phase of the plane - wave lof is a free parameter , which is allowed to vary in order to obtain the maximum level of squeezing .    in fig .",
    "9 , we represent the spatial distribution of squeezing , for @xmath281 and at @xmath270 , when the finite size detector is displaced across the transverse dimension .",
    "we consider three different values of the detector size @xmath282 normalized to the bs width @xmath283 , see eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) , as indicated in the figure . in the three cases",
    "the phase of the plane - wave lof ( not shown ) has been chosen in order to obtain the maximum squeezing at each position of the detector in the transverse plane .",
    "a clear conclusion can be extracted from these plots : the smaller is the detector size , the smaller is the squeezing level one attains .",
    "this is to be expected as the smaller the photodetector is , the larger influence of high spatial frequency modes , i.e. , with the smaller photodetector the influence of all sort of nonsqueezed modes is larger than with the larger photodetectors which filter out high frequency modes .",
    "one more conclusion one can extract from the figure is that the squeezing level is larger , for all detector sizes , at the center of the soliton ( @xmath284 ) , i.e. , the soliton is more squeezed than the vacuum ( for large @xmath200 the soliton amplitude tends to zero and the squeezing is due to the squeezed vaccum ) .    finally we focus on the influence of the detector size on the degree of squeezing reached when the detector is placed at the exact center of the soliton .",
    "10 shows the maximum squeezing reached in these conditions at frequency @xmath270 when a detector of normalized size @xmath150 is considered .",
    "several features can be appreciated in the figure . as a general trend ,",
    "the squeezing level degrades as the detector size is reduced , i.e. , the maximum level of squeezing is found for a very large detector .",
    "but , interestingly , for @xmath285 , the squeezing decreases with the increase of the detector size .",
    "obviously , for detectors whose size falls in this region what is happening is that the fluctuations being detected come from both the bs and the trivial solution ( below threshold emission ) existing far from the detector .",
    "in fact we see that the phase of the local oscillator that optimizes the squeezing level ( represented with a dashed line , left vertical axis ) , which is almost insensitive to the detector size for @xmath286 , changes rapidly in this detector width region .",
    "then , for large detectors , @xmath287 , the monotonic increase of squeezing with the detector width is recovered and the optimum phase for the lof  is again almost insensitive to the detector size .",
    "in this article we have developed a general theory for the analysis of linearized quantum fluctuations of optical dissipative structures generated in wide aperture nonlinear optical cavities .",
    "although we have done this explicitly for the special case of the degenerate optical parametric oscillator in the large pump detuning limit , our method can be easily generalized to any other nonlinear cavity .",
    "the method consists , in short , in expanding the fluctuations in the biorthonormal base that the eigenvectors of the linear deterministic operator of the linearized langevin equations of the system .",
    "this technique allows , in particular , the identification of a special mode which is perfectly squeezed ( in the linear approximation ) . the perfect squeezing occurs irrespective of the nonlinear cavity parameter values , and the special mode can be identified with the transverse linear momentum of the dissipative structure that is being emitted .",
    "it must be emphasized that the existence of this squeezed mode is a genuine transverse effect , i.e. , it is associated to the symmetry breaking introduced by the existence of dissipative structures .",
    "then we have applied this theory to the study of squeezing of a particular dissipative structure , namely , the bright cavity soliton . in particular",
    "we have analyzed the squeezing occurring at the different bifurcations that this dissipative structure can undergo at the same time that the appropriate lof for detecting it in each situation . then we have studied the squeezing detected when a plane wave lof is used and analyzed its dependence on the parameter values . finally we have considered also finite size detectors .",
    "we have shown that for large detectors the squeezing level is large almost independently of the system parameters . for finite size detectors ,",
    "we have analyzed the spatial distribution of squeezing .",
