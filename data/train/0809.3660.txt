    "in the last few decades , the density of transistors in a chip has been consistently duplicated every two years , as given by moore s law .",
    "this demand is pushing the semiconductor devices fabrication ( in particular , for si ) towards the atomic limit in which the number of dopants is so small that their exact position and distribution affects the performance of a transistor .",
    "@xcite there is therefore a great interest in achieving an atomic control over the position of impurities in si .",
    "@xcite this interest has been reinforced by the proposal of using shallow donors ( typically p or as ) as spin qubits for a si - based quantum computer ,  @xcite and related ones that followed ,  @xcite where qubit operations are performed by manipulating the donor electron with an external electric field provided by local gates .",
    "spin is a natural candidate for a qubit , particularly in si where very long spin coherence times have been measured ( at least @xmath1 ms in natural si ) .",
    "@xcite spin coherence time has to be orders of magnitude longer than the time required for operations , and enough to allow for quantum error correction.@xcite    in the doped si - based quantum computer ,  @xcite schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcproposal ] , single - qubit operations ( rotations of the spin state on the bloch sphere ) are accomplished with an ac magnetic field in resonance with the level splitting of the hyperfine coupled nuclear spin - electron spin system .",
    "the hyperfine coupling is proportional to the probability density of the electron wave - function on the donor .",
    "therefore , the on and off resonance condition is controlled by applying electric fields to manipulate the electron wave - function .",
    "two - qubit operations could in principle be performed by letting electrons in neighboring donors interact via a transient exchange coupling during a specified period of time .",
    "@xcite combinations of these exchange mediated operations and single spin rotations configures a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate .",
    "@xcite with the one qubit rotations and the cnot gate any operation on @xmath2 qubits may be performed .",
    "@xcite    we have considered the problem of a donor a distance @xmath3 from a si / sio@xmath0 ( 001 ) interface and studied the manipulation of the donor electron by electric and magnetic fields .",
    "our study applies for cases when @xmath3 is large enough so that , under an applied field , abrupt ionization ( via tunneling ) takes place .",
    "@xcite when no external fields are applied , the only attractive potential felt by the electron is the donor coulomb potential and , at the low temperatures relevant here , the electron remains bound to the donor [ see fig .",

    "bound states exist at the triangular well .",
    "when @xmath4 reaches a characteristic strength @xmath5 such that the bound state at the interface is degenerate in energy with the bound state at the donor , tunelling between the two wells ( the donor coulomb potential , and the triangular well at the interface ) is possible . in this way",
    ", we can reversibly manipulate the position of the electron between the donor and the interface by oscillating the electric field around @xmath5 [ namely , going back and forth from situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - d - i](b ) to situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - d - i](c ) ] .",
    "note that the electron , when at the interface , may still remain bound to the donor along the xy - plane , and hence , the electron may be confined in all three space directions upon certain conditions that will be described below .",
    "we simplify the problem by assuming that the sio@xmath0 barrier is infinite .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe our model and discuss the peculiarities of the conduction band of si , that has a multivalley structure .",
    "we also describe our basis set consisting on the lowest uncoupled donor and interface states . in particular , we point out the conditions that guarantee the confinement in all 3 directions of space of the electron at the interface . in sec .",
    "[ sec : manipulation ] we discuss the conditions that allow the manipulation of the donor electron to be possible , in particular :  @xcite ( i ) we calculate the value of the characteristic electric field at which shuttling of the electron between donor and interface may occur ; and(ii ) we estimate the tunneling time of this process .",
    "we also briefly discuss the effect of a magnetic field applied parallel to the electric field .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : exchange ] we discuss how the 2-qubit operations could be performed with the electrons at the interface state  @xcite and show new results for the calculation of the exchange calculated with an improved heitler - london method .",
    "@xcite we finish with a discussion and conclusions in sec .  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the wavefunction of a donor electron in a semiconductor can be written as an expansion in terms of the bloch waves close to the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "@xcite the conduction band of si has six minima ( valleys ) located in the @xmath6 directions at a distance @xmath7 ( @xmath8 @xmath9 the lattice parameter of si ) from the @xmath10 point .",
    "therefore , combinations of bloch waves from the 6 valleys have to be considered , and the donor ground state wave - function would be 6-fold degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted when the coupling between bloch waves from different valleys due to the singular donor coulomb potential is taken into account ( the so - called valley - orbit coupling ) .",
    "the resulting ground state is non - degenerate and it is a symmetric combination of the six valleys ( symmetry a@xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite within the effective mass approximation , only the bloch functions at the positions of the conduction band minima are involved , and the ground state of the electron at the donor is written  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 are envelope functions ( @xmath14 = + x ,- x,+y ,- y,+z ,- z ) , and @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is a reference site , which represents a pinning site for the bloch waves in the superposition state . in the case of a single bloch state",
    ", @xmath16 contributes with an irrelevant phase , but for superposition states it leads to interference effects . for an isolated impurity , @xmath16 is naturally chosen to be the position of the donor ( @xmath17 ) .    for the description of the interface state it has to be taken into account that the ( 001 ) interface breaks the degeneracy of the 6 valleys , making the x , -x , y , and -y valleys much higher in energy than the z and -z valleys .",
    "@xcite ( a tensile strain has the same effect on the valley degeneracy ) .",

    "@xcite the parameter @xmath23 is related to the width of the wave - function at the interface in the z - direction while @xmath24 gives the width of the wavefunction along the xy plane .",
    "@xcite for the isolated interface , we assume the pinning site @xmath25 is exactly at the interface .",
    "the value of @xmath24 depends on how far the donor is from the interface .",
    "when the electron is at the interface it still feels the attractive potential of both the donor and its image [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme - d - i ] ( d ) ] .",
    "typical values of @xmath24 range from @xmath26 nm for @xmath27 nm to @xmath28 nm for @xmath29 nm . if we want to be able to shuttle the electron between the interface and the donor reversibly , we need the electron to be confined at the interface , and not to spread forming a two - dimensional gas .",
    "this gives us a limit for the maximum planar density of around @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite    the fact that the 6-valley degeneracy is broken at the interface plus the fact that the smooth potential between the donor and the interface does not couple valleys in different directions , allows us , in a first approach to the problem , to consider only the z and -z valleys for the state at the donor . this simplification would be exact for strained si .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to use @xmath32\\ ] ] with @xmath33 the donor envelope function centered at @xmath34 .",
    "this is a hydrogen - like envelope with an anisotropic shape that arises due to the conduction band effective mass anisotropy in si , multiplied by the factor @xmath35 that guarantees that the wavefunction fulfills the boundary condition for an infinite barrier at @xmath36 .",
    "we are interested here in the situation where the donor is relatively far from the interface , i.e , the ground state wavefunctions in each well do not overlap significantly , and in this range the variationally determined bohr radii @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the same as for a donor in bulk ( @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 nm ) .  @xcite    note that",
    ", for each isolated well , the value of the splitting between the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the bloch waves and which one is the ground state depend on the value of the pinning positions @xmath41 or @xmath25 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "let us write now the full hamiltonian for a donor ( at @xmath42 ) in si a distance @xmath3 from a ( 001 ) interface with sio@xmath0 .",
    "the boundary problem between the two semi - infinite dielectrics is considered by including the image charges for the donor and for the electron ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] ) . a uniform electric field , perpendicular to the interface , is also included .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is ,  @xcite in rescaled atomic units @xmath43  nm and @xmath44  mev , @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 cm / kv , and the electric field @xmath4 is given in kv / cm .",
    "the next terms are the donor image @xmath51 and the electron image @xmath52 @xmath53 is a function of the dielectric constants @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with this @xmath53",
    "we get that the donor image potential is attractive while the electron image potential is repulsive .    the last term in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - effunits ] ) describes valley - orbit effects , namely the coupling between different valleys due to the singular nature of both the donor @xmath57 and the interface @xmath58 potentials .",

    "two typical cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : antic ] .",
    "@xcite when @xmath78 , the two states at the interface are degenerate and only two anticrossings , involving three levels each , occur . for the more general case of @xmath79 ,",
    "there are typically four anticrossings , involving two levels each . for particular values of @xmath3 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath80 , the coupling between levels is so strong that one anticrossing can involve all four levels .    to determine the characteristic field @xmath5 at which the shuttling of the electron between donor and interface may occur and the times involved in the process , we need to look at the anticrossing between the lowest eigenvalues . the value of the electric field at which the anticrossing happens is @xmath5 and the gap between levels at anticrossing gives an estimate for the tunneling time @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] we show the value of @xmath5 versus @xmath3 for the single valley approximation , the 2-valley model with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 mev .",
    "the three curves show the same qualitative shape .",
    "the small shift between them arises due to the changes produced in the ground state energies when the valley orbit coupling is included ( this change is illustrated , with respect to the single valley energy , in fig .",
    "[ fig : vo ] ) .",
    "therefore , the multivalley structure of the conduction band of si does not significantly affect the value of @xmath5 .",
    "this was , in fact , expected from previous tight - binding results that took into account the six valleys .",
    "@xcite very recent experiments on a si finfet with a single donor  @xcite show the same kind of behavior for @xmath5 versus @xmath3 that we find here .",
    "now we look at the value of the gap between levels calculated at anticrossing : the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] . for the 2-valley model with degenerate states at the interface ( @xmath82 )",
    "the result is qualitatively similar to the smooth decrease already observed in the single valley approximation .",
    "@xcite this is due to the fact that only one of the degenerate levels at the interface is coupled to the lowest level of the donor , leading to an effectively single valley result .",
    "however , a qualitative striking difference is observed when a finite valley orbit coupling is present at the interface : the gap versus @xmath3 shows oscillations that go as @xmath84 $ ] , namely , the oscillations are not commensurate with the lattice .",
    "the tunneling times we get within the single valley approximation range from subpicosecond to nanoseconds depending on @xmath3 ( larger @xmath3 correspond to longer vales of @xmath85 ) .",
    "the times corresponding to the multivalley result can be much larger for @xmath3 s such that @xmath86 , but the statistical weight of such points ( see the stars in fig .  [",
    "fig : gap ] ) is relatively small .",
    "therefore , in an ion implanted sample , where the control on the donor depth positioning is limited , most donors would have tunneling times comparable to the single valley results , while others would take much longer .",
    "we have also analyzed the effect of a magnetic field applied parallel to the electric field .",
    "@xcite the magnetic field shrinks the electron wavefunction in the direction parallel to the interface .",
    "the effect is much stronger for less confined wavefunctions .",
    "consequently , the wavefunction at the interface is much more affected than at the donor .",
    "the increase in confinement is concomitant with an increase in energy , which is hence significant at the interface while very small at the donor for magnetic fields on the order of a few tesla .",
    "this magnetic field induced shift in energy has an interesting consequence : starting from an electric field just above @xmath5 ( so the electron is at the interface ) , the application of a magnetic field can push the electron back to the donor .",
    "@xcite the manipulation of electrons using simultaneously electric and magnetic fields can help us distinguish donor electron from other moving charges in real systems .  @xcite",
    "we have discussed above how the multivalley nature of the conduction band of si produces oscillations in the tunneling time involved in the shuttling of an electron between donor and interface .",
    "similar oscillations have been found in the exchange interaction between electrons in neighboring donors as a function of the distance @xmath87 between them .",
    "@xcite    since the donor electron is much less confined at the interface than at the donor well , the transient exchange interaction between donors very distant from each other in the bulk , where they do not interact , could be performed by pulling ( with an electric field ) the two corresponding electrons towards the interface , where they would interact . besides ,",
    "if the two neighboring donors are at the same distance @xmath3 from the interface , we do not expect to get oscillations on the exchange versus interdonor distance @xmath87 .",
    "the 2d interface potential formed by two donors separated a distance @xmath87 from one another and at the same depth @xmath3 from the interface has the double - well shape , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : int - double - well ] along the axis ( @xmath88 ) connecting the well minima , as given by the expression @xmath89    the distance @xmath87 between donors has to be large enough so that the single electron wavefunction is below the barrier between the wells , to guarantee that the electron shuttling between donor and interface is reversible . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] we show the exchange calculated for donor pairs at three different distances from the interface as a function of the interdonor distance .",
    "the calculations were performed in 2d , using the heitler - london approximation with an improved hybrid variational wave - function which is gaussian in the center , where the parabolic approximation for the potential is valid and has an exponential decay at long distances of the well minimum , where the potential saturates and deviates significantly from the parabolic behavior ,  @xcite    @xmath90    this _ ansatz _ involves five parameters , three of which ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ) are obtained from the boundary conditions and normalization , and we are left with two variational parameters ( @xmath22 , and @xmath14 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath93 is obtained from @xmath94 .",
    "the adopted matched variational wavefunction gives an exchange coupling which fits well with the asymptotic values given by more rigorous calculations  @xcite and which is orders of magnitude larger than the one we previously calculated using a pure gaussian variational form for the electron wavefunction at the interface .",
    "@xcite the exchange we are getting is of the order of the one estimated for gated quantum dots in gaas .",
    "we have discussed here some of the relevant parameters that would allow elementary operations involved in the manipulation of donor electrons in si close to a sio@xmath0 interface for quantum computing applications . for our calculations",
    "we have considered an ideal semi - infinite sio@xmath0 barrier . however , in real devices  @xcite metallic gates are located on top of a relatively thin ( few nm wide ) sio@xmath0 barrier .",
    "it seems then that a more realistic description of the devices should take into account the metallic gates .",
    "there exists a calculation similar to ours in the opposite limit of an infinitesimal sio@xmath0 barrier separating the si layer from the metallic gate .",
    "@xcite in that case , @xmath95 and the image charges have opposite sign to the real charges .",
    "in particular , the donor image potential will be repulsive instead of attractive and this can seriously deteriorate the confinement of the electrons along the xy - plane at the interface . for a realistic case of a sio@xmath0 barrier width of @xmath96 nm and an interface - donor distance @xmath97 nm ,",
    "@xcite we would be in between the two extreme cases of a semi - infinite sio@xmath0 barrier considered here and an infinitesimal one considered in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the width of the wavefunction at the interface @xmath24 would be larger than reported here . by comparing our @xmath24 with the results reported in ref .",
    "[ see @xmath98 in the inset of fig .",
    "4 ] we can estimate at most a doubling of @xmath24 when metallic gates are included .",
    "this pushes the upper limit for the donor planar density towards smaller values , still keeping our qualitative conclusions valid .",
    "another relevant issue is related to the modification of the spin coherence time t@xmath0 when donors are located close to a si surface .",
    "different experiments @xcite have revealed that t@xmath0 gets smaller than in bulk when donors are located close to an interface : bulk values reach @xmath99 ms while close to a surface they range from @xmath100 ms  @xcite to @xmath101  @xcite for different samples .",
    "t@xmath0 depends on the quality of the interface ( it is longer for a hydrogen passivated surface than for a si / sio@xmath0 interface  @xcite ) and the distance from the donor to the interface @xmath3 .",
    "some effects that may be responsible for the decrease of coherence times are the magnetic noise produced by impurities and other defects ( like p@xmath102 centers ) at the interface ,  @xcite and/or the recombination of donor electrons on the p@xmath102 centers .",
    "@xcite these observations imply that increasing the interface quality may be crucial for the practical implementation of a si - based quantum computer .    in summary",
    ", we have described the basic conditions that would allow the manipulation of donor electrons in si by external fields , taking into account the multivalley structure of the conduction band of si .",
    "experiments are getting close to the limit of isolated donors  @xcite where the operations discussed here are relevant .",
    "in fact , qualitative agreement for the behavior of @xmath5 versus @xmath3 has already been found in samples with isolated donors in a si finfet ,  @xcite in a situation where the donor is closer to the interface   than we considered in the present study . both situations ( small and large values of @xmath3 as compared to the effective electronic confinement lengths )",
    "are important , and should be carefully investigated in the context of applications of donor electrons as carriers of quantum information through its charge or spin degrees of freedom .",
