    "blazars , which include bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , represent the class of gamma - ray emitters with the largest fraction of members associated with known objects @xcite .",
    "they are active galactic nuclei with their jets closely aligned to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "their emission is thus both beamed and boosted through relativistic effects , so that a large range of observed properties can result from even small variations in their physical conditions and orientation . as a result ,",
    "the physics of jet launching and confinement , particle acceleration , emission , and variability , remain unclear , despite decades of intense theoretical and observational studies .",
    "blazars are broadband emitters exhibiting spectral energy distributions ranging from cm radio wavelengths to the highest gamma - ray energies with a characteristic `` double - humped '' appearance .",
    "while the mechanism of their high - energy ( x - ray to gamma - ray ) emission remains debatable , it is well established that lower - energy jet emission is due to synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "linear polarization is one property characteristic of the low - energy emission .",
    "polarization measurements of blazar synchrotron emission can be challenging , yet remarkably valuable .",
    "they probe parts of the radiating magnetised plasma where the magnetic field shows some degree of uniformity quantified by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a homogeneous field and @xmath9 is the total field .",
    "the polarized radiation then carries information about the structure of the magnetic field in the location of the emission ( strength , topology and uniformity ) .",
    "temporal changes in the degree and direction of polarization can help us pinpoint the location of the emitting region and the spatiotemporal evolution of flaring events within the jet .    of particular interest",
    "are rotations of the polarization angle in optical wavelengths during gamma - ray flares , instances of which have been observed through polarimetric observations concurrent with monitoring at gev and tev energies , with _",
    "@xcite and magic @xcite respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such rotations were proven to be associated with the outbursting events of the gamma - ray emission , then the optopolarimetric evolution of the flare could be used to extract information about the location and evolution of the gamma - ray emission region .",
    "such events have stimulated intense interest in the polarimetric monitoring of gamma - ray blazars ( ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these efforts have been focusing more on `` hand - picked '' sources and less on statistically well - defined samples aiming at maximising the chance of correlating events . consequently , although they have resulted in the collection of invaluable optopolarimetric datasets for a significant number of blazars , they are not designed for rigorous statistical studies of the blazar population ; the most obvious one being the investigation of whether the observed events are indeed statistically correlated with gamma - ray flares , or are the result of chance coincidence . the robopol program has been designed to bridge this gap .    the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we aim to present the results of a survey that robopol conducted in june 2013 , which is the first single - epoch optopolarimetric survey of an unbiased sample of gamma - ray  loud blazars . as such",
    ", it is appropriate for statistical phenomenological population studies and for testing blazar population models .",
    "secondly , we wish to alert the community to our optopolarimetric monitoring program and to encourage complementary observations during the skinakas winter shutdown of december  march .    after a brief introduction to the robopol monitoring program in section [ sec : program ] , the selection criteria for the june 2013 survey sample and the july ",

    "quiet blazars are also discussed .",
    "we summarise our findings in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the robopol program has been designed with two guiding principles in mind :    1 .   to provide datasets ideally suited for rigorous statistical studies ; 2 .   to maximise the potential for the detection of polarization rotation events .    to satisfy the former requirement ,",
    "we have selected a large sample of blazars on the basis of strict , bias - free , objective criteria , which are discussed later in this paper . to satisfy the latter ,",

    "the long - term observing strategy of the robopol program is the monitoring of @xmath10 100 target ( gamma - ray  loud ) sources and an additional @xmath1015 control ( gamma - ray  quiet ) sources with a duty cycle of about 3 nights for non - active sources and several times a night for sources in an active state .",
    "the robopol instrument ( described in the `` instrument '' paper ) is a novel - design 4-channel photopolarimeter .",
    "it has no moving parts , other than a filter wheel , and simultaneously measures both linear fractional stokes parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this design bypasses the need for multiple exposures with different half - wave plate positions , thus avoiding unmeasurable errors caused by sky changes between measurements and imperfect alignment of rotating optical elements .",

    "the selection criteria for the candidate sources in this sample are summarised in table  [ sample_select ] .",
    "this selection resulted in 142 sources potentially observable in the month of june which constitute a _ statistically complete _ sample .",
    "the sources were observed according to a scheduling algorithm designed to maximise the number of sources that could be observed in a given time window based on rise and set times , location of sources on the sky , and resulting slewing time of the telescope . at the end of the survey , 133 of these sources had been observed .",
    "because the scheduling algorithm was independent of intrinsic source properties , the resulting set of 133 observed sources is an _ unbiased _ subsample of the statistically complete sample of the 142 sources ( summary in fig .  [ chart ] ) .",
    "the completeness of the sample is @xmath44 for sources brighter than 16 magnitude , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) for sources brighter than 17 magnitude , and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for sources brighter than 18 magnitude .    to identify sources suitable for inclusion in the `` control '' sample , a number of non-2fgl cgrabs ( candidate gamma - ray blazar survey , * ?",

    "cgrabs was a catalog of likely gamma - ray  loud sources selected to have similar radio and x - ray properties with then known gamma - ray  loud blazars .",
    "however , because fermi has a much improved sensitivity at higher energies than its predecessors , fermi - detected blazars include many sources absent from cgrabs , with harder gamma - ray  spectra than cgrabs sources , especially at lower gamma - ray fluxes . to ensure that non - cgrabs sources among our gamma - ray  loud sample do not affect our conclusions when populations of gamma - ray  loud and gamma - ray  quiet blazars are found to have significantly different properties , in such cases we will also be performing comparisons between our `` control '' sample and that fraction of our gamma - ray  loud sample that is also included in cgrabs .",

    "the gamma - ray  loud sample has fractionally more bl lacs ( about 50% ) than the gamma - ray  quiet control sample ( about 10% ) , which is expected when comparing gamma - ray  loud with gamma - ray  quiet samples , but which should , however , be taken into account when interpreting our results .",

    "24 additional `` high interest '' sources , that did not otherwise make it to the sample list .",
    "these observations will later allow the characterisation of each source s typical behaviour ( i.e. average optical flux and degree of polarization , rate of change of polarization angle , flux and polarization degree variability characteristics ) .",
    "this information will be further used to :    1 .",
    "improve the optical polarization parameters estimates for future polarization population studies , 2 .   develop a dynamical scheduling algorithm , aiming at self - triggering higher cadence observing for blazars displaying interesting polarization angle rotation events , for the 2014 observing season , 3",

    "were selected so that gamma - ray  quiet source observations could be taken at any time and the gamma - ray  loud sources could be prioritized .",
    "in contrast , the gamma - ray  quiet sources for the monitoring sample were selected in order of _ increasing _ declination , to avoid as much as possible the northernmost sources which suffer from interference in observations by strong northern winds at times throughout the observing season at skinakas .",
    "the steps followed for the selection of the june survey sample and the first season monitoring one are summarised schematically in fig .",
    "[ chart ] .",
    "the complete sample of our monitored sources is available at robopol.org .",
    "the 2nd fermi gamma - ray catalog , from which the parent gamma - ray - loud sample is drawn , represents a `` from - scratch '' all - sky survey in @xmath55  mev gamma - rays , so the limit in gamma - ray flux should in principle result in a clean , flux - limited sample .",
    "one possible source of bias however is the process of characterisation of a source as a `` blazar '' , in which case other catalogs of blazars ( principally from radio surveys ) are used for the identification and classification of sources . given that 575 of the 1873 fermi catalog sources are unassociated , that bias may in fact be non - trivial : we do nt know how many of the unassociated sources are blazars , and we can not a priori be certain that the properties of any blazars among the unassociated sources are similar to those of confidently associated blazars .",
    "unassociated sources are not however uniformly distributed among fluxes and galactic latitudes .",
    "brighter sources , sources in high galactic latitudes , and sources with hard spectra tend to have smaller positional error circles and are more easily associated with low - energy counterparts ( because of more photons available for localization , lower background , and better single - photon localization at higher energies , respectively ) .",
    "the first of these two factors lower the fraction of unassociated sources among the 2fgl sources that satisfy our galactic latitude and gamma - ray  flux cuts , from @xmath56 to @xmath57 the effect of possible biases due to the presence of unassociated sources in 2fgl can be further assessed , as part of theoretical population studies , under any particular assumption regarding the nature of these sources , as well as if , at some point in the future , a large fraction of these sources become confidently associated with low - energy counterparts .",
    "any other minor biases entering through our choices of limits in gamma - ray flux and @xmath1 magnitude can be accounted for in theoretical population studies given the cuts themselves , the uncertainty distribution in the measured quantities ( which can be found in the literature ) , and some knowledge of the variability of these sources ( obtainable from fermi data in gamma rays , and , at the most basic level , from comparing historical magnitudes with magnitudes from this work in the r - band ) .",

    ", we conducted robopol observations , weather permitting , for 21 nights . of those , 14 nights had usable dark hours .",
    "the most prohibiting factors have been wind , humidity and dust , restricting the weather efficiency to 67% , unusually low based on historical skinakas weather data . during this period",
    ", a substantial amount of observing time was spent on system commissioning activities . in the regular monitoring mode of operations a much higher efficiency",
    "is expected .    during the survey phase a total of 135 gamma - ray  loud targets ( 133 of them comprising the unbiased subsample of the 142-source sample and 2 test targets ) , 17 potential control - sample sources , and 10 polarization standards , used for calibration purposes , were observed . for the majority of the sources , a default exposure time of @xmath58 min divided into 3 exposures",
    "was used to achieve a polarization sensitivity of @xmath59 for a 17 mag source with polarization fraction of 0.03 , based on the instrument sensitivity model .",
    "shorter total exposures were used for very bright sources and standard stars , and their duration was estimated on - the - fly .",
    "typically we observed 2 different polarimetric standards every night to confirm the stability of the instrument ( see `` pipeline '' paper ) .    in summary , we observed 133 + 17 blazars belonging to the unbiased subsamples of the gamma - ray  loud and gamma - ray ",

    "the pipeline performs aperture photometry , calibrates the measured counts according to an empirical instrument model , calculates the linear polarization fraction @xmath62 and angle @xmath63 , and performs relative photometry using reference sources in the frame to obtain the @xmath1-band magnitude .",
    "entries in table  [ surveyresults ] with _ no _ photometry information are sources for which ptf data do not exist and the usno - b data were not of sufficient quality for relative photometry .",
    "polarimetry , for which only the relative photon counts in the four spots are necessary , can still of course be performed without any problem in these cases .",
    "the photometry error bars are dominated by uncertainties in our field standards , while the polarization fraction and angle errors are photon - count dominated .",
    "for the few cases where multiple observations of a source were obtained in june , weighted averaging of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 has been performed .",
    "the quoted uncertainty follows from formal error propagation assuming that @xmath64 and @xmath65 follow normal distributions and that the polarization has not changed significantly between measurements .",
    "the @xmath62 values and uncertainties @xmath66 shown in table  [ surveyresults ] are the raw values as produced by the pipeline , without any debiasing applied to them , and without computing upper limits at specific confidence levels for low @xmath67 ratios .",

    "because our observing strategy and data processing pipeline is uniform across sources , if the intrinsic polarization fractions of gamma - ray  loud and gamma - ray  quiet sources were indeed drawn from the same distribution , then the resulting _ observed _ distributions of @xmath62 would also be consistent with being the same .",
    "each of them might not be consistent with the intrinsic @xmath62 distribution of the blazar population , because of biasing , and because at low @xmath67 values what is being recorded is in general more noise than information ; however , biasing and noise would affect data points in both populations in the same way and at the same frequency , and the resulting observed distributions , no matter how distorted , would be the same for the two subpopulations .",
    "for this reason , we compare the observed raw @xmath72values ( as they come out of the pipeline ) of the two samples of 89 gamma - ray  loud sources and 15 gamma - ray  quiet sources .",

    "there are two noteworthy pictures in this plot : the clustering of low signal - to - noise ratio measurements in the lower - right corner of the plot , and the scarcity of observations in the upper - left part of the plot .    the first effect is expected , as low polarization fractions are harder to measure for fainter sources with fixed time integration .",
    "this is a characteristic of the june survey rather than the robopol program in general : in monitoring mode , robopol scheduling features adaptive integration time to achieve a uniform signal - to - noise ratio down to a fixed polarization value for any source brightness . for source brightness higher than magnitude of 17",
    "we have measured polarization fractions down to @xmath88 : most measurements at that level have @xmath89 .",
    "for source brightness lower than magnitude of 17 the same is true for polarization fractions down to @xmath90 .",
    "these limits are shown with the thick solid line in fig .",

    "the second effect  the lack of data points for @xmath1 magnitudes lower than 16 and polarization fractions higher than @xmath91 as indicated by the dotted lines  may be astrophysical in origin : in sources where unpolarized light from the host galaxy is a significant contribution to the overall flux , the polarization fraction should be on average lower .",
    "this contribution also tends to make these sources on average brighter .",

    "all values of @xmath62 used in this section are debiased as described in section [ debiasing ] . based on the results of our previous discussion",
    ", we will assume that the probability distribution of @xmath62 in a sample of blazars can be described as @xmath94 in order to be formally correct , there should be a factor of @xmath95 in the denominator of equation [ thedist ] to correct for the fact that @xmath62 is defined in the @xmath96 $ ] rather than the @xmath97 interval ; the correction is however small for the values of @xmath98 that are of interest here .",
    "the mean , @xmath98 , is the single parameter of this family of distributions , and it is the quantity that we seek to estimate from our data for each subsample .    in the population studies that follow , we will include only sources with @xmath99 .",
    "however , in order to avoid biasing our statistics by this choice , we apply sharp cuts in @xmath72space that exclude most , if not all , of our low @xmath67 measurements ; these cuts can then be explicitly corrected for in our analysis ( which will assume that sources below a certain @xmath62 value do exist , in numbers predicted by the exponential distribution , but can not be measured ) .",
    "these selection criteria are visualised by the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ photometry ] .",
    "we thus split each population into two sub - samples , along the ( measured ) @xmath1-mag 17 line , and , for each population , we consider each subsample to be a distinct `` experiment '' with a different data cut ( @xmath88 for bright sources and @xmath100 for faint sources ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows the likelihood of @xmath98 for the gamma - ray  loud ( solid line ) and gamma - ray  quiet ( dashed line ) populations .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimate of @xmath98 with its 68% confidence intervals is @xmath121 for gamma - ray  loud blazars and @xmath122 for gamma - ray",
    " quiet blazars .",
    "the maximum - likelihood values of @xmath98 differ by more than a factor of 2 , consistent with our earlier finding that the two populations have different polarization fraction pdfs .",
    "however , because of the small number of gamma - ray ",
    "quiet sources surviving the strict signal - to - noise cuts we have imposed in this section ( only 7 objects ) , the gamma - ray ",
    "quiet @xmath98 can not be pinpointed with enough accuracy and its corresponding likelihood exhibits a long tail towards high values .",
    "for this reason , the probability distribution of the difference between the @xmath98 of the two populations , which is quantified by the cross - correlation of the two likelihoods , has a peak , at a difference of @xmath123 , which is less than 2@xmath124 from zero .",
    "this result is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the accuracy with which the gamma - ray ",
    "quiet @xmath98 is estimated can be improved in two ways .",
    "first , by an improved likelihood analysis which allows us to properly treat even low @xmath67 sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) . and second , by an improved survey of the gamma - ray  quiet population ( more sources to improve sample statistics , and longer exposures to improve the accuracy of individual @xmath62 measurements ) . a more difficult - to - assess uncertainty , especially at low values of @xmath62 , is the effect of interstellar polarization .",
    "however , because of the ability of the robopol instrument to measure polarization properties for all sources in its large @xmath125 field of view , the amount of interstellar - dust  induced polarization can in principle be estimated studying the polarization properties of field stars in the vicinity of each blazar .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the difference between the uniform distribution and that of the measured @xmath63 when sources with low ( but high - significance ) @xmath72values are included is likely astrophysical . for low polarization sources , any foreground polarization picked up by their optical light during propagation would be a larger fraction of the overall polarization , and any preferred direction in the foreground polarization would affect more significantly the final value of @xmath63 . indeed , half of the sources removed by the @xmath130 have polarization angles covering only a small range of values , between @xmath131 and @xmath132 degrees ( close to the maximum of the solid - line histogram in the upper panel of fig .",

    "we have presented first results from robopol , including a linear polarization survey of a sample of 89 gamma - ray  loud blazars , and a smaller sample of 15 gamma - ray ",
    "quiet blazars defined according to objective selection criteria , easily reproducible in simulations , and additional unbiased cuts ( due to scheduling and quality of observations , independent of source properties ) .",
    "these results are therefore representative of the gamma - ray  loud and gamma - ray ",
    "quiet blazar populations , and as such are appropriate for populations studies .",
    "our findings can be summarised as follows :    * the hypothesis that the polarization fractions of gamma - ray  loud and gamma - ray quiet blazars are drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the @xmath3 level . * the probability distribution functions of polarization fraction of gamma - ray  loud and gamma - ray ",
    "quiet blazars can be well described by exponential distributions . * using a likelihood analysis we estimate the best - estimate values and @xmath128 uncertainties of the mean polarization fraction of each subpopulation , which is the single parameter characterising an exponential distribution .",
    "we find @xmath4 for gamma - ray  loud blazars , and @xmath5 for gamma - ray  quiet blazars . * the large upwards uncertainty of @xmath98 for gamma - ray ",
    "quiet blazars is a side - effect of the strict cuts we have applied in our likelihood analysis , leaving us only with 7 useable sources for the gamma - ray  quiet sample .",
    "this is the reason why the statistical inconsistency between the two populations can not be also verified with this method .",
    "this problem can be improved with a larger gamma - ray  quiet blazar survey , longer integration times , and a more sophisticated analysis . *",
    "polarization angles , @xmath63 , for blazars in our survey are consistent with being drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "it is the first time a statistical difference between the average polarization properties of gamma - ray  quiet and gamma - ray  loud blazars is demonstrated in optical wavelengths .",
    "the difference is consistent with the findings of @xcite for the radio polarization of gamma - ray  loud and , otherwise similar , gamma - ray  quiet sources .",
    "it thus appears that the gamma - ray  loud blazars overall exhibit higher degree of polarization in their synchrotron emission than their gamma - ray  quiet counterparts .",
    "one interpretation for this finding may involve the degree of uniformity of the magnetic field over the emission region , which is an important factor affecting the degree of polarization .",
    "the bulk of synchrotron in gamma - ray  loud blazars might therefore originate in regions of higher magnetic field uniformity than the emission from gamma - ray  quiet blazars .",
    "it is possible that shocks that are strong / persistent enough to accelerate particles capable of gamma - ray emission are also better in locally aligning magnetic field lines and producing regions of high field uniformity , hence a higher polarization degree .",
    "we have found hints of depolarization at high optical fluxes , an effect that may be attributable to the contribution of unpolarized light to the overall flux by the blazar s host galaxy .",
    "the statistics of bl lac hosts at least are consistent with this idea : in about @xmath138 of the sources studied by @xcite the host would have a contribution of more than 50% the core flux inside our typical aperture",
    ". we will examine the effect quantitatively and in more detail using our full first season data in an upcoming publication .",
    "inclusion of sources of low ( but significantly measured ) polarization fraction in the empirical distribution of polarization angles generates some tension ( although still not statistically significant ) between that distribution and an expected uniform one .",
    "this may be a result of foreground polarization at a preferred direction , which , although small and not important for high - polarization sources , tends to align lower polarization sources .",
    "although the sources in the robopol sample have been selected to lie away from the galactic plane so foreground polarization due to interstellar dust absorption should be at a minimum , nearby interstellar material might also induce some degree of foreground polarization .",
    "for example , such an effect , at the @xmath139 level , has been seen in the southern sky by @xcite .",
    "a similar level of foreground polarization , @xmath140 , has been suggested by @xcite for the vicinity of bl lac ( which however lies at relatively low galactic latitude @xmath141 ) .",
    "a cut at @xmath129 ensures that sources are intrinsically at least twice as polarized as that , so the effect in measured @xmath63 is minimised . because the @xmath13 fields around sources in our monitoring program accumulate exposure during our observing season , we will be eventually able to measure the polarization properties of non - variable , intrinsically unpolarized sources induced by foregrounds to higher accuracy , and better study and correct for this effect in the future .    for the remainder of the 2013 season we have been monitoring a 3-element sample in linear polarization with robopol : an unbiased gamma - ray  loud blazar sample ( 51 sources ) ; a smaller , again unbiased , gamma - ray  quiet sample ( 10 sources ) ; and a list of high - interest sources that have not made our cuts ( 24 sources ) . after the end of the 2013 season",
    ", we will present first light curves and analysis of our sources in terms of polarization variability and cross - correlations in the amplitude and time domains .",
    "finally , we will revisit our monitoring sample definition , to strengthen the robustness of criteria ( for example , using robopol average r - band fluxes for the @xmath1 magnitude cuts ) , and to develop our automatic scheduling algorithm which aims to self - trigger high cadence observations during polarization changes that are unusually fast for a specific source . in this way",
    ", we aim to better constrain the linear polarization properties of the blazar population at optical wavelengths and to provide a definitive answer to whether a significant fraction of fast polarization rotations do indeed coincide with gamma - ray flares .",
