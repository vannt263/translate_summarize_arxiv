    "when a source of ionizing radiation turns on in a neutral gas , the i - front initially moves supersonically as a weak , r - type front and outruns the gas dynamical disturbance it creates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) . in a uniform gas , the front eventually slows to twice the isothermal sound speed of the ionized gas as it approaches the size of the equilibrium strmgren sphere and is transformed into a subsonic d - type front , usually preceded by a shock .",
    "thereafter , it is very much affected by gas dynamics . @xcite",
    "first considered this problem in the cosmological context of the expanding igm , deriving the general equations describing i - front evolution and solving them analytically for the case of constant gas clumping factor and temperature .",
    "they found that global cosmological i - fronts typically stayed in the weak , r - type regime as the density dropped over time , failing to reach the strmgren radius .",
    "this result justifies subsequent approximate treatments of cosmic reionization in the inhomogeneous igm that results from structure formation which neglect the gasdynamical back reaction of the i - fronts .",
    "however , when the i - fronts encounter self - shielding inhomogeneities ( like halos ) large and dense enough to trap the i - fronts and convert them to d - type , this approximation must break down .",
    "within the cdm paradigm cosmological structures form hierarchically in time , starting with the smallest - scale structures at the highest redshifts , which grow through accretion and mergers to form larger and larger structures .",
    "while the cold dark matter clumps gravitationally on all scales , only virialized halos with total mass above the cosmological jeans mass can retain their gas content .",
    "these virialized halos can be divided into two main classes , halos with virial temperature above @xmath1 k whose gas can cool through atomic line cooling of hydrogen , leading to efficient star formation in such halos , and smaller - mass halos ( minihalos ) whose gas in absence of metals can only cool through @xmath2 molecules , which are fragile and easily destroyed .",
    "thus , the first class of halos are generally believed to be the dominant sources of the radiation responsible for cosmic reionization , while typical minihalos were unable to form stars once the first generation created a background of dissociating uv starlight .",
    "subsequently , minihalos were just inert balls of neutral gas .",

    "[ rt_code_figs ] , title=\"fig:\",width=230 ]    in the last few years there has been an intense development of new numerical radiative transfer methods for cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , most of the existing methods are not efficient enough to be directly coupled to gas- and n - body dynamics , which limits the scope of their applications .",
    "one common problem is that the fast , r - type i - front propagation timescale ( sometimes approaching the light - crossing time ) is much shorter than the fluid dynamical and gravitational times , leading to the necessity of very small time - steps to track the i - fronts correctly .",
    "in addition , the bound - free opacity of the neutral gas is very high , so algorithms for spatial differencing the transfer equation often require very small cell sizes , and this implies very small time steps even when the i - fronts are subsonic .",

    "however , to generalize these `` zoomed - in '' calculations to 3-d and a simulation volume large enough to encompass both small- and large - scale structure , it is necessary to develop a more sophisticated radiative transfer algorithm .",
    "we have recently developed such a method , which accurately follows both fast and slow i - fronts without need to adopt such small time - steps or cell sizes .",
