    "<S> vibrational - excitation cross sections of ground electronic state of carbon dioxide molecule by electron - impact through the co@xmath0 shape resonance is considered in the separation of the normal modes approximation . </S>",
    "<S> resonance curves and widths are computed for each vibrational mode . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations assume decoupling between normal modes and employ the local complex potential model for the treatment of the nuclear dynamics , usually adopted for the electron - scattering involving diatomic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> results are presented for excitation up to 10 vibrational levels in each mode and comparison with data present in the literature is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the technological problems , connected with strategies for reduction of the global warming coming from the greenhouse effect produced by carbon dioxide , is represented by the capture at source and storage of the co@xmath1 gas , mainly based on the plasmolysis process leading to the splitting of co@xmath1 into co molecules and atomic or molecular oxygen  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the dissociation processes is strongly determined by the vibrational activation of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> models of co@xmath1 plasmas , aimed to optimize and clarify this chemical conversion , have recently been constructed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main limitation of these models is the lack of information on electron - impact cross sections or rate coefficients for collisions inducing vibrational transitions in co@xmath1 molecules ; as result modellers usually resort to estimated rates or approximate scaling - laws  @xcite .    in order to fill this void , in this letter we present a preliminary data set of electron - impact cross sections for vibrational excitation of ground electronic state of carbon dioxide molecule useful in plasma kinetic modeling . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections show two distinctive features observed experimentally : a @xmath2 shape resonance around 3.8 ev  @xcite and , at energies below 2 ev , an enhancement due to the presence of the @xmath3 symmetry virtual state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both phenomena are explained in terms of a temporary co@xmath4 system . for a general review on this topics </S>",
    "<S> see itikawa paper  @xcite and references therein .    </S>",
    "<S> we present here the cross sections for the following process : @xmath5 which occurs through the formation of the shape resonance generated by the electronic state @xmath2 of the @xmath6 ion . </S>",
    "<S> co@xmath1 in its ground electronic state , @xmath7 , is a linear molecule with c  o equilibrium distance @xmath8  @xmath9 characterized by three normal modes of vibration , denoted in the following by @xmath10 and referred to , respectively , as the symmetric stretching , bending mode ( doubly degenerate ) and asymmetric stretching .    </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to compute the cross sections employing the local model of resonant collisions as formulated for diatomic vibrational excitation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results for the symmetric stretch mode only , were given previously  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we present calculations on all the three normal modes of the molecule , for @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and for electron collision energies from the threshold up to 10  ev .    </S>",
    "<S> a peculiar aspect of the the doubly degenerate @xmath2 symmetry of co@xmath4 ion is that it splits , upon bending , into two ( renner - teller ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 components , no longer degenerate , due to the breaking of linear geometry ( @xmath15 symmetry to @xmath16 symmetry of bending mode ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a second aspect , that derives from the stretch - bend coupling possible in polyatomic molecules , is an accidental degeneracy of vibrational levels belonging to different modes , known as fermi resonance @xcite . in the case of co@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> a quasi - degeneracy occurs between the pure stretch @xmath17 and the pure bending @xmath18 levels ( fermi dyads ) that result in a near 50:50 mixing of the two states which is well - known experimentally @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we neglect this stretch - bend coupling ; it is at least arguable that including it will only result in redistribution of flux in the excitation cross sections rather than radically different excitation rates .    [ </S>",
