    "continuous and fuzzy transitions between quantum and classical effects in many experiments provoke ongoing discussions about an existence of quantum effects in the domain of classical physics .",
    "the most publicly known example is the schr \" odinger cat experiment @xcite , which has stimulated many challenging experimental tests of quantum effects with a large number of particles .",
    "also , non - classical features of light were tested on very strong squeezed states @xcite .",
    "further , in the series of experiments in trapped ions @xcite , cavity - qed experiments @xcite , at optical frequencies @xcite , microwave frequencies @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite , the quantum correlation between a two - level system and an oscillator has allowed to prepare a nonclassical quantum state of a larger number of particles .",
    "the non - classicality means here an incompatibility with oscillations possible in classical coherence theory @xcite .",
    "there have been developed many criteria of non - classicality , for example @xcite , @xcite etc . however , as the number of particles increases , many already demonstrated nonclassical effects are critically sensitive to a coupling with an environment @xcite .",
    "it seems to be therefore very challenging to observe the nonclassical effects at a truly macroscopic limit of large ensembles , which correspond to a traditional domain of classical physics .",
    "quantum optics may contribute significantly to this challenge .",
    "essentially , any macroscopic state of light is generated by a large ensemble of emitters with discrete energy levels producing individual photons .",
    "the most basic are single photon emitters , developed recently with very small multi - photon contributions , as was demonstrated for two - level atoms @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , nv centers @xcite or molecules @xcite .",
    "single photon states of light are advantageously insensitive to fragile phase and provably exhibit very robust nonclassical and even quantum non - gaussian features @xcite .",
    "they remain detectable for large optical losses , therefore suitable for a wide range of applications .",
    "moreover , that robust non - classicality and quantum non - gaussianity of light from a single emitter can be detected by a single - photon version of the hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) measurement @xcite .",
    "recently , an extension of this measurement has been used to derive a hierarchy of operational and reliable non - classicality criteria @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we predict that arbitrary large ensemble of independent , incoherent and even low - efficiency single photon emitters can produce experimentally provable nonclassical light without any phase reference and under realistic conditions . to prove it , we modify the hierarchy of non - classicality criteria @xcite for light from many emitters .",
    "the modified criteria allow us to prove that if single - photon emitters individually produce nonclassical light testable by the criteria , then source consisting of an arbitrarily large number of these single photon emitters generates also nonclassical light .",
    "the proposed observation of nonclassical light is very robust against many imperfections of the source .",
    "we verify two positive aspects of emission from ensemble of single photon sources compared to emission from a single one .",
    "first , the non - classicality can be witnessed more reliably .",

    "nonclassical states of light are from the point of view of coherence theory defined as quantum states beyond the mixtures of coherent states  @xcite .",
    "a technique for their detection and corresponding applied criteria have to be able to reliably and unambiguously detect weakly nonclassical states of light without phase reference and without any prior assumption about their source .",
    "the detectors must be free of any systematic errors which could cause an overestimation of the non - classicality .",
    "moreover , the criteria used for the tests of non - classicality have to be applicable also for a large number of emitters .",
    "the methodology of such operational non - classicality criteria constructed purely from a prior knowledge about the detection scheme presented in the ref .",
    "@xcite can be modified to our purpose .",
    "the criteria can be applied to an extension of hanbury - brown - twiss type of the experiment with single photon detectors depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the emitted light from the source impacts on a network of beam splitters ( bs ) and emerging beams are measured by avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) .",
    "they can distinguish typically with a low efficiency only photons from the vacuum .",
    "both the inefficiency and dark counts of the apds reduce the nonclassical aspects , but they can not produce them . ignoring them in the construction of the criteria will not therefore cause overestimation of the non - classicality . on the other hand , the detection technique needs to be free of any saturation effects which can artificially increase the estimated non - classicality . for the same reason , it is important to measure the effective splitting ratios including the transmissivity and reflectivity of the beam splitters together with the generally different efficiencies of the apds and consider it for the derivation of the criterion .",
    "the non - classicality can be proven from the hierarchy of linear functionals @xmath3 of the density matrix , in which probability @xmath1 corresponds to events when a single chosen apd does not click and @xmath4 is the probability that no click is registered by all @xmath0 apds .",
    "advantageously , we use a parametrization by @xmath1 and @xmath4 , different to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , to be able to simply prove our results and reach the best recognition of nonclassical light .",
    "we consider now the network of beam - splitters splitting light symmetrically to all @xmath0 detectors .",
    "note that the proposed criteria can be modified for any unbalanced network , similarly to a simple example in ref .",
    "optimizing the functional @xmath3 over all classical coherent states leads to a threshold function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "this limitation arises from an optimal mean number @xmath7/(m-1)$ ] of photons in the classical coherent state .",
    "the linearity of the employed functional guarantees that any convex combination of coherent states can not surpass the threshold @xmath8 for any parameter @xmath9 . in turn , the existence of @xmath9 for which @xmath10 guarantees the non - classicality of a given state .",
    "the optimal choice of the parameter @xmath9 for a particular probability @xmath4 corresponds to minimizing right side of inequation @xmath11 over @xmath9 .",
    "it gives raise to an explicit form of sufficient conditions of non - classicality @xmath12 which can not be fulfilled by any classical state of light .",
    "the coherent states reach @xmath13 .",
    "the condition ( [ noncl ] ) for @xmath14 approximates the requirement yielded from commonly used measurement of intensity correlation function @xmath15 for states with very low photon flux @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the criterion ( [ noncl ] ) is exact , without any approximative steps used for example in refs .",
    "it is therefore valid even for bright sources of light , where the photon flux can not be substituted by a probability of a click .",
    "the proposed criteria ( [ noncl ] ) are based only on the knowledge about the detection method , for example the effective beam splitting ratio .",
    "it is therefore suitable to reliably detect very small non - classicality of bright light .",
    "importantly , inequation  ( [ noncl ] ) can not be satisfied by any multi - mode classical state @xmath17 which is a consequence of the fact , that the threshold function @xmath8 resulting from the optimization does not increase due to the multi - mode structure .",
    "the non - classicality of light from any source can be thus examined even for an arbitrary large number of modes .",
    "suitable form of the hierarchy of non - classicality criteria ( [ noncl ] ) allows to straightforwardly prove following result .",
    "consider an ensemble of independent emitters .",
    "each emitter gives raise to probability of no detection events @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where subscript @xmath20 denotes probabilities for an emitter @xmath20 . because emitters are considered independent , the vacuum probability of the whole ensemble yields @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "there is a connection between non - classicality of a single emitter and the non - classicality of whole ensemble following from the statement @xmath23 for arbitrary @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , any ensemble of independent emitters all individually satisfying ( [ noncl ] ) generates arbitrarily bright nonclassical light detectable by the same criterion ( [ noncl ] ) . due to a very suitable parametrization of the problem ,",
    "the expression can be proved by simple algebraic rules .",
    "a main task was to find the most suitable parametrization of non - classicality criteria , so that the proof is simple and broadly understandable .",
    "although participating @xmath26 single - photon emitters can be quite different , the non - classicality of light emitted by each emitter suffices to obtain a nonclassical state yielded from arbitrarily large ensemble of them . in the supplementary material ,",
    "we discuss a tolerance of the nonclassical light emission from realistically unstable large ensembles .",
    "to obtain a conclusive proof of non - classicality , the statistical errors of the measured distance from the non - classicality threshold have to be sufficiently small .",
    "the necessity of small errors dictates in turn a minimal time needed for such experimental estimation .",

    "interestingly , light from many emitters increases the distance of the point from the non - classicality threshold_. as can be seen in fig  2 , the distance is very sensitive to the single photon emitter efficiency @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , the presented plot suggests , that small number of the experimental runs will suffice to obtain reliable estimate about non - classicality of emitted light . for larger number of detectors @xmath0 , the distance @xmath35 saturates to @xmath43 for small @xmath44 .",

    "a remaining limit for the detection of nonclassical light seems to be only finite measurement time .",
    "the distance from the threshold ( [ noncl ] ) for @xmath14 is depicted in the fig .",
    "( [ figmacro ] ) .",
    "the distances have to be smaller than demanded number of standard deviation units obtained by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is measurement time .",
    "the approximation is correct only with assumption @xmath42 and @xmath63 . for a large number of emitters and corresponding large photon flux",

    "according to ( [ dist ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , it appropriates to optimization of the measured time @xmath68 .",
    "one can find an optimal photon flux @xmath69 and the corresponding increase of time is quadratic in number of emitters .",
    "on the contrary , the necessary measurement time grows exponentially without performing the optimal attenuation .",
    "since an arbitrarily large ensemble of such emitters generates non - classical light , its detection reduces to search of relevant experimental scheme and parameters optimization .",
    "a large number of trapped atoms or ions @xcite can be advantageously used for an experimental demonstration .",
    "we consider a system containing @xmath26 ions in a cigar - like shaped crystal @xcite trapped in a focus of a lens with a numerical aperture of 0.2 corresponding to 1% of the full solid angle being continuously driven by excitation laser .",
    "we estimate a minimal measurement time needed to proof non - classicality of emitted light , which we set to time needed for reaching @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is one standard deviation of measured distance @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the number of ions in the trap is constant , which is justified if @xmath72 , where @xmath62 is measurement time , @xmath73 is storage time of an ion in the trap and @xmath26 is a number of ions .",
    "thus for very conservative storage time @xmath74  day and an ensemble containing several tens of ions , the measurement should no exceed one hour .",
    "if the required measurement time exceeds this assumption , the experiment can to be repeated several times with shorter time duration and with same initial number of emitters , so that statistics of decaying number of emitters is included in the measured vacuum probability .",
    "collected photons are collimated and directed towards two apds through variable attenuator and an ordinary 50:50 bs as depicted in fig  1 .",
    "the emitted fluorescence collected by the lens is then detected with very modest overall detection efficiency @xmath40=0.2  % , which corresponds to realistic value of single photon detector quantum efficiency of 50  % , 50:50 splitting ratio of the beam splitter and additional 20  % absorbtion and reflection losses at optical elements .",
    "considering the excitation and detection of the photons from the dipole transition of some frequently used alkaline earth metal ions with the excited state lifetime @xmath75 , we set the length of the single measurement time - bin to @xmath76 to minimize the multi - photon contributions from the same ion in the single time - bin .",
    "the efficiency @xmath40 can be further artificially decreased by the variable attenuation with factor @xmath64 .",
    "this attenuation strongly influences the measurement duration and one can find optimal @xmath77 which minimizes the measurement time .",
    "the estimated optimal photon flux per single time bin in our case corresponds to @xmath78 .",
    "the probability of a click for such flux is @xmath79 . as can be seen in the simulation results presented in fig .",
    "[ simulationx ] , our approach enables to demonstrate non - classicality of emitted light within a @xmath80 hours for an ensemble of up to @xmath81 ions , which approaches a truly macroscopic limit .    in the presented simulation",
    "we account for the effect of saturation of conventional single photon detectors which becomes substantial typically at a count - rate of about @xmath82khz , what corresponds approximately to @xmath83 . for the photon flux of the source below this value",
    ", the apds can be opened per each temporal mode without being saturated . as can be seen in the fig .",
    "[ simulationx ] , the minimal measurement time in this region rapidly decreases due to the simultaneous increase of the distance @xmath35 and measured photon flux as the number of emitters @xmath26 grows . above this region , we start avoiding the saturation of detectors by keeping both apds switched - off most of the time and opening them only for  @xmath84 periods with a frequency of the opening given by the saturation limit .",
    "activation of this mechanism is responsible for a strong kink in the dependence of the minimal measurement time on the number of particles at @xmath83 .",
    "further increase of the number of particles is compensated by decreasing the overall time in which apds are switched on .",
    "the minimal measurement time in this region stays approximately constant up to the point , where the frequency of apd switching - off reaches 500  khz , which corresponds to regime where one photon is detected at each apd in almost each detection period .",
    "we note , that we do nt consider a detection of more than one photon by single apd in a given detection interval , which is prohibited by dead time @xmath85 of apds being typically @xmath86ns .",
    "this assures , that further increase of number of emitters will not cause saturation in this regime . when compared to conventional beam - splitter type of attenuation to obtain the regime below detector s saturation which is depicted by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ simulationx ] , this approach substantially reduces total measurement time .",
    "this is mainly caused by the fact , that an estimated optimal value of the @xmath87 is far behind the saturation limit of conventional single photon detectors .",
    "further increase of the number of emitters and corresponding photon flux behind this value is then compensated by usual beam - splitter type of attenuation with attenuation factor @xmath64 which gives a quadratic increase of measurement time .",
    "practically , our methodology can be generally applied as an efficient tool enabling unambiguous searching for nonclassical behavior hidden in various experimental platforms without any prior knowledge .",
    "a potential of nonclassical states of large ensemble can be further found in quantum metrology and quantum communication .",
    "the proposed experiment will likely move forward ongoing investigation of quantum to classical transitions with large quantum or even mesoscopic systems .",
    "statistics of the number of emitters clearly influences the non - classicality of emitted radiation . if the emitters generate exactly single photon , the thermal ( poissonian ) statistics of emitters will produce thermal ( poissonian ) statistics of light . on the other hand ,",
    "the emitters producing states @xmath88 can be measured as nonclassical using the hierarchy of criteria ( eq .  ( 1 ) in the main text ) only if @xmath89 where the averaging is over the fluctuating number of emitters .",
    "inserting low efficiency approximation @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath42 into the hierarchy of criteria ( eq .  ( 1 ) in the main text ) and considering terms only up to @xmath45 , we obtain that the variance @xmath92 has to be smaller than poissonian to obtain the nonclassical light detectable for any @xmath24 .",
    "the approximation of small @xmath93 for ( [ subpois ] ) has been verified numerically and compared to ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "sub - poissonian statistics of single photon emitters therefore suffices to generate detectable nonclassical light . for the simplest scheme with @xmath14 and the ensemble of imperfect single - photon emitters producing an approximative state @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are small single - photon and two - photon contributions",
    ", we can approximatively obtain the condition @xmath96 .",
    "the ratio @xmath97 corresponds to the ratio @xmath98 converging to the correlation function @xmath99 for @xmath95 , where @xmath100 is a probability of a coincidence detection and @xmath101 is approximately a probability of a detection event at the single detector .",
    "non - vanishing @xmath99 therefore suppresses the upper bound on @xmath102 below the poissonian limit .",
    "if the number of emitters is controlled reasonably below poissonian limit , the detection of nonclassical states from a large number of emitters is feasible .      for the test of non - classicality of emitted light from @xmath26 emitters",
    ", it is not needed to know the number of emitters .",
    "it is ideal for the test , however , the number of single photon emitters exponentially decays with relatively small time constant in many experimental platforms .",
    "they can either gradually leave the ensemble to the environment or they can gradually loose possibility to emit light .",
    "let us consider an ensemble that initially contains @xmath26 single photon emitters radiating maximally a single photon with probability @xmath40 .",
    "further , we assume that a probability that an emitter radiates in the ensemble at time @xmath103 is @xmath104 , where @xmath73 is storage time of the emitter in the ensemble .",
    "the photon distribution of such source in time is @xmath105 according to ( [ fluctprob ] ) , it is possible to understand the losses of emitters from the ensemble as an attenuation of emitted light with the transmittancy @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the fluctuating number of emitters can be included in the efficiency of the individual emitters @xmath107 , which enters the vacuum probabilities @xmath108 and @xmath109 . since @xmath110 ,",
    "all previous conclusions for @xmath111 remain valid for @xmath112 , if the measurement starts in time @xmath113 and lasts for time @xmath62 much shorter than @xmath72 hence the number of emitters is stable during measurement .",
    "however , long measurement time or a large number of emitters violate this assumption and the detected vacuum probability has to be averaged @xmath114 the average probability @xmath115 is yielded by substitution @xmath116 in ( [ avrvac ] ) .",
    "the view , how this averaging limits the observation of non - classicality , is reached in an approximation of very weak sources @xmath42 , where the integration is analytically achievable .",

    ", we can substitute @xmath120 in the expansion of @xmath121 .",

    "the second parts proportional to @xmath45 do not contribute to the expansion only if @xmath123 $ ] for any @xmath124 .",
    "consequently , it dictates condition on a maximal number of single photon emitters such that the measurement duration @xmath62 does not cause lost of non - classicality for @xmath42 and any @xmath124 @xmath125 the small time @xmath62 compared to the storage time gives approximative condition @xmath126 .",
    "the lost of visibility of non - classicality can be avoided by repeating the measurement several times with the same initial number of emitters .      the efficiency of generation and detection of emitted single photons from individual emitters @xmath40 can fluctuate during the measurement time , although the number of emitters is definite .",
    "the probability of vacuum is then @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the random efficiency of generation in @xmath20th emitter and @xmath130 means mean value .",

    "the different and fluctuating @xmath40 of single photon emitters thus can not hinder the observability of nonclassical light .",
