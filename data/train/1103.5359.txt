    "the double beta ( @xmath23 ) decay experiments are considered to - date as the best way to determine an absolute scale of the neutrino mass and to establish the neutrino mass hierarchy , to clarify the nature of the neutrino ( majorana or dirac particle ) , to look for existence of right - handed admixtures in the weak interaction and of hypothetical nambu - goldstone bosons ( majorons ) , and to test some other effects beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the developments in the new experimental techniques during the last two decades lead to an impressive improvement of sensitivity to the neutrinoless ( @xmath24 ) mode of @xmath25 decay up to @xmath26 yr @xcite . allowed in the standard model the two neutrino ( @xmath27 ) double beta decay",
    "was detected for 10 nuclides with the half - lives in the range of @xmath28 yr @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the experiments to search for the double electron capture ( @xmath29 ) , the electron capture with emission of positron ( @xmath30 ) , and the double positron ( @xmath31 ) decay is substantially lower : the best counting experiments give only limits on the level of @xmath32 yr @xcite decay processes in @xmath33ba and @xmath34ba was obtained in geochemical measurements @xcite ; however , this result has to be confirmed in a direct counting experiment . ] .",
    "there is a strong motivation to develop experimental technique to search for these processes : study of neutrinoless @xmath29 and @xmath35 decays could clarify the contribution of the right - handed admixtures in weak interactions @xcite .",
    "dysprosium contains two potentially @xmath23 active isotopes : @xmath2dy with one of the largest releases @xmath36 kev ( therefore both @xmath29 and @xmath35 channels of decay are possible ) , and @xmath3dy ( @xmath37 kev , only double electron capture is energetically allowed ) @xcite .",
    "the decay schemes of the triplets @xmath2dy@xmath38tb@xmath38gd and @xmath3dy@xmath39tb@xmath39gd are presented in fig . 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "it should be mentioned the possibility of a resonant enhancement of the neutrinoless double electron capture in @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy due to energy degeneracy .",
    "the resonant double electron capture was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where an enhancement of the decay rate by some orders of magnitude was predicted for the case of coincidence between the released energy and the energy of an excited state . according to @xcite , high @xmath40 atoms are strongly favored to search for resonant @xmath29 decay .",
    "dysprosium has one of the highest @xmath40 among nuclides for which resonant processes could occur .",
    "resonant captures are possible on a few excited levels of @xmath2gd and one level of @xmath3gd .",
    "the properties of the excited levels are listed in table  [ tb1 ] .",
    ".characteristics of possible resonant neutrinoless double electron capture in @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy .",
    "difference @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the double beta decay energy , @xmath43 is the energy of an excited level ) is denoted as @xmath44 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tb5 ]    the theoretical half - lives were found very big . indeed , the predicted half - life is @xmath45 yr even for the decay with the biggest energy release ( @xmath2dy @xmath46gd,@xmath47344.3 kev ) .",
    "theoretical estimates give no hope for realistic observation of alpha decays of all naturally abundant dysprosium isotopes to the excited level of daughter nuclei . at the same time the detection of the @xmath2dy decay to the ground state of @xmath48gd ( supposing one will apply crystal scintillators from dysprosium enriched in @xmath2dy ) looks possible .",
    "indeed we have estimated the half - life as @xmath49 yr by using the approach @xcite .",
    "the important advantage of scintillation methods is an almost 100% detection efficiency to alpha particles and pulse - shape discrimination ability @xcite .",
    "development of enrichment methods for dysprosium isotopes and radiopure crystal scintillators containing dy are requested to observe @xmath7 activity of natural dysprosium .",
    "the first experiment to search for @xmath23 processes in @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy was carried out in the underground gran sasso national laboratories of infn by using ultra - low background hp ge @xmath1 spectrometry .",
    "after 2512 h of data taking with a 322 g sample of highly pure dysprosium oxide ( dy@xmath5o@xmath6 ) limits on double beta processes in @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy have been established on the level of @xmath50 yr .",
    "the search for the resonant @xmath51 capture in @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy to excited levels of daughter nuclei was of particular interest .",
    "taking into account the strong dependence of the process on the difference between the double beta decay energy and the energy of an excited level , a more accurate determination of the difference in atomic masses of @xmath2dy  ",
    "@xmath2gd and @xmath3dy  ",
    "@xmath3gd isotopes is strongly required . a precise study of the 1914.8 , 1946.4",
    ", 1952.4 , 1988.5 and 2003.8 kev levels of @xmath2gd characteristics ( spin , parity , decay scheme ) is important too .",
    "theoretical calculations of double beta decay of dysprosium are scarce ; in fact , the only known estimations for @xmath2dy ( g.s . to g.s .",
    "transitions ) are @xmath52 yr ( for the effective neutrino mass of 1 ev ) @xcite , @xmath53 yr , @xmath54 yr @xcite . the present study is the first experimental attempt to search for double beta processes in @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy , which both are rather interesting isotopes for @xmath23 experiments taking into account a possible resonant double electron capture on excited levels of daughter nuclei .",
    "the sensitivity of the experiment can be advanced to the level of @xmath55 yr by using enriched @xmath2dy and @xmath3dy isotopes deeply purified from radioactive elements , and increasing the exposure and detection efficiency by application of multi - crystal hp ge detectors .",
    "the search for alpha decay of dysprosium isotopes to the excited levels of daughter nuclei was realized as a by - product of the experiment on the level of sensitivity @xmath56 yr .",
    "however , the obtained limits are very far from the theoretical predictions even for the @xmath7 transition of @xmath2dy with the highest energy of decay ( @xmath57 yr ) . at the same time the detection of @xmath7 decay of @xmath2dy to the ground state of @xmath48gd ( theoretical estimations of the half - life",
    "are on the level of @xmath58 yr ) looks reasonably realistic by using crystal scintillators containing dysprosium enriched in @xmath2dy .",
    "such crystal scintillators could be also used to search for double beta processes in @xmath2dy .",
    "we have found that the dy@xmath5o@xmath6 sample contains on the level of several mbq / kg @xmath59lu , @xmath60u and @xmath61ra ; the activities of @xmath62ra and @xmath62th are @xmath63 and @xmath64 bq / kg , respectively .",
    "the results of the @xmath1 spectrometry are consistent with the data of the icp - ms analysis for radionuclides .",
    "the contamination of the dysprosium sample can be explained by the production of lanthanides from monazite , an ore with high concentration of uranium and thorium .",
    "presence of radioactive @xmath59lu can be due to the similar chemical properties of lutetium and dysprosium , which provides some difficulties in chemical separation of the elements .",
    "the authors from the institute for nuclear research ( kyiv , ukraine ) were supported in part by the project `` kosmomikrofizyka-2 '' ( astroparticle physics ) of the national academy of sciences of ukraine .",
