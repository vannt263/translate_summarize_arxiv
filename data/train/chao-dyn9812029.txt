    "a large number of problems in physics , chemistry , etc , can be represented in terms of a set of differential equations , which constitute a ( very often nonlinear ) dynamical system . among these systems of interest ,",
    "autonomous dynamical systems are particularly common .",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional autonomous dynamical system can be represented by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , represent field variables , usually related to quantities associated with the specific problem under consideration , @xmath6 is a continuous parameter , which can often be considered as the time , while the functions @xmath7 , @xmath5 , are general functions of their arguments .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional space constituted by the @xmath4 is called the system s phase space , with trajectories in this phase space representing the solutions of  ( [ syst ] ) .",
    "it is possible to interpret the trajectories generated by all the initial conditions in phase space as analogous to the paths followed by the particles of a flowing fluid with velocity field @xmath8 , where an overdot represents a derivative with respect to @xmath6 . if @xmath9 , the system is said to be a non - autonomous dynamical system .",
    "however , introducing a new variable @xmath10 , the @xmath0-dimensional non - autonomous dynamical system can be transformed into a @xmath11-dimensional autonomous system .",
    "an autonomous system is said to be hamiltonian if ( [ syst ] ) represents the set of hamilton s equations and the phase space has a simplectic structure .",
    "otherwise we have a dissipative or non - hamiltonian system . in this case",
    ", volumes in phase space are not conserved , or , equivalently , @xmath12 .",
    "consider a general nonlinear autonomous dynamical system with dimension @xmath13 . among these systems",
    "those exhibiting chaotic behavior have assumed particular interest and constitute a rule than an exception . roughly speaking",
    ", chaos means extreme sensitivity to small changes in the initial conditions . due to nonlinearity , fluctuations in the initial conditions of chaotic systems evolve such that they can completely alter the asymptotic outcome of the unperturbed trajectories in phase space .",
    "there are several ways of analyzing chaos in dynamical systems , such as the liapunov exponents or the technique of poincar surface of sections for hamiltonian systems .",
    "( for good reviews and books on chaotic dynamical systems see , for instance @xcite . )",
    "we are particularly interested in certain features underlying chaotic dynamical systems , namely sets characterized by a non - integer dimension .",
    "such sets are known as fractals . in the realm of dissipative systems , attractors with fractal properties",
    "have been called strange attractors , whereas in hamiltonian systems there exist the strange repellers @xcite , identified as repellers with fractal properties .",
    "an important numerical task in investigating chaotic behavior in dynamical systems is therefore the determination of the fractal dimension  @xcite .",
    "the presence of fractals is related to chaos , and so these structures are also associated with sensitivity to small changes in initial conditions . to show this relation , we follow closely the procedure of  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a non - fractal basin boundary @xmath14 that separates two attractors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , usually fixed points ( this will be explained further in section  [ examples ] ) . an uncertainty in our initial condition",
    "@xmath17 that has strength @xmath18 means that the initial condition lies somewhere in the region @xmath19 .",
    "according to figure  1 , given an uncertainty @xmath18 , the initial condition  1 always goes to the attractor @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the point  2 lies near the boundary @xmath14 , due to the uncertainty @xmath18 the actual trajectory may go to either attractor @xmath16 or attractor @xmath15 .",
    "the initial condition  1 is said to be @xmath18-certain , and the initial condition  2 is @xmath18-uncertain .",
    "obviously , @xmath18-uncertain initial conditions are those which lie within a distance @xmath18 of the basin boundary @xmath14 .",
    "let us call @xmath20 the probability of obtaining an @xmath18-uncertain initial condition , in the sense that it is the fraction of the @xmath0-dimensional volume of the phase space which lies within @xmath18 of the boundary @xmath14 . in the case of a simple non - fractal boundary , @xmath21 .",
    "this scaling law tells us that an improvement in the accuracy of the initial condition by , say , a factor @xmath22 ( a reduction of @xmath18 by @xmath22 ) , reduces @xmath20 , and hence our probability of potential error , by a factor of @xmath22 . for the case of a fractal boundary",
    "the scaling law  ( see appendix )    @xmath23    is valid , where @xmath24 is the uncertainty exponent .",
    "the box - counting dimension of the basin boundary , @xmath25 , is given by  @xcite    @xmath26    with @xmath0 denoting the dimension of the phase space .",
    "for a fractal boundary , @xmath27 , implying that @xmath28 , whereas for a non - fractal boundary , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "suppose that , for instance , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then , in order to reduce the probability of error @xmath20 by a factor of 10 , a reduction of @xmath18 by an order of @xmath33 is needed .",
    "the improvement in prediction by increasing the accuracy of the initial conditions is seen to be less favorable the smaller @xmath24 is .",
    "related to the above discussion , this paper presents a set of software routines , implemented in maplev r.4/5 , together with an optional interface in c for fast numerical integration , which , among other things , calculates the dimension of the fractal basin boundary .",
    "the main goal is to determine numerically the scaling law  ( [ scaling ] ) and therefore the fractal dimension .",
    "consider an initial condition @xmath34 and perturb one of the coordinates , say @xmath35 , in order to obtain two initial conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 . by integrating",
    "numerically we can determine to which attractor or asymptotic state both of the perturbed initial conditions goes .",
    "we call the original initial condition uncertain if the perturbed initial conditions have distinct attractors .",
    "if a large number of initial conditions are chosen randomly in a given region of the phase space , it is possible to determine the fraction @xmath38 of these that are uncertain , where @xmath38 is the ratio between the number of uncertain conditions and the total number of initial conditions .",
    "this process can be repeated for several values of @xmath18 . according to bleher  _ et .",
    "_ in  @xcite , the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath38 are proportional , so that the parameter @xmath24 can be determined by the scaling of @xmath38 with @xmath18 .",
    "the package has the following features :    * user - friendly software tools for fast numerical integration of both hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian dynamical systems , as well as a set of commands for the flexible presentation of the results ; * an optional c interface for fast high - precision numerical integration ; * tools for determining sets of initial conditions that satisfy given constraints , expressed , e.g. , as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a given function of @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; * the ability to perform combined symbolic and numerical studies by implementing these software tools in a symbolic computing environment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ package ] we give a summary of the package s commands , followed by a detailed description of its most relevant commands , mainly nsolve , for the generation of initial conditions and numerical integration of the system allowing 2d or 3d plots , view , for changing the ranges of all variables ( including the time ) and fdimension , to determine the dimension of the fractal basin boundary ; section  [ examples ] illustrates the application of various commands of the package to two examples with known results already presented in the literature ; section  [ perform ] analyzes the performance of the various integration schemes , and section  [ conclude ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "basically the _ ndynamics _ package consists of a set of routines for calculating the numerical evolution of dynamical systems and plotting the results .",
    "the package generates initial conditions in a user - defined region , subject to constraints provided by the user . after calculating the evolution of each trajectory ,",
    "the user may use its plotting commands to locate possible regions of interest  regions where the system presents chaotic behavior , and so on . finally , a set of routines is available to calculate the fractal dimension of the boundaries using box - counting algorithms .",
    "a brief review of the commands of the package is as follows :    * nsolve takes as arguments a dynamical system , the _ ranges _ of the initial conditions ( from which it generates the initial conditions ) , the range for the time ( independent variable ) , and the time step to be used when plotting the associated trajectories .",
    "the variables to be included in the final plot ( which can be 2d or 3d ) must also be defined ; * view generates a plot from points already calculated , allows the user to modify the ranges for all the variables ( including the time ) , and to swap between 2d and 3d plots ; * boxcount applies the box counting algorithm to determine the number of hypercubes of side @xmath18 ( see the introduction ) covering the boundary ; * fdimension uses boxcount for many values of @xmath18 to calculate the fractal dimension of the boundary .      a complete description of the _ ndynamics _",
    "package s commands is found in the on - line help .",
    "here we present the most relevant part of that description .",

    "we have presented a set of software tools which allow great flexibility for the analysis of dynamical systems composed of first - order ordinary differential equations , even though the construction of these programs was mainly motivated by the computation of fractal dimensions of basin boundaries of chaotic systems , this is not their only use , as was highlighted in the previous section .",
    "large regions of phase space can be readily studied with a fairly large number of initial conditions , allowing the user to quickly find regions of interesting behavior .",
    "the optional numerical interface allows for faster numerical integration than with maple s internal routines .",
    "the ease of use of the maple software is thus combined with a faster numerical interface ( here implemented in c , though this can be easily modified to use routines written in other languages such as fortran ) , thereby allowing intensive numerical study of dynamical systems .",

    "one possible way to determine the fractal dimension of @xmath57 is as follows . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us suppose that @xmath55 is a hypercube of side @xmath58 . dividing @xmath55 into @xmath44 hypercubic `` cells '' of side @xmath18 , and evaluating the number of cells @xmath59 that contain points belonging to the subset @xmath57 we expect that for @xmath60 we have a good approximation to the exact result given in  ( [ dim6 ] ) .",
    "however the number of cells @xmath61 rapidly increases as @xmath52 , and this approach becomes impractical .",
    "an alternative approach is that of selecting @xmath62 random cells in @xmath55 and counting the number of cells @xmath63 that have points belonging to @xmath57 .",
    "we expect that @xmath64 as @xmath62 becomes statistically sound .",
    "supposing that , indeed , @xmath65 we have @xmath66 defining @xmath67 we have @xmath68 both @xmath48 and @xmath69 can be measured , allowing us to determine @xmath24 and the fractal dimension @xmath70 of @xmath57 .    in the previous discussion , little",
