    "the most promising candidate sources for the ligo / virgo / geo/@xmath13 network of ground based gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometric detectors are coalescing binary systems made of massive ( stellar ) black holes @xcite .",
    "signal to noise ratio ( snr ) estimates @xcite suggest that the first detections will concern black hole binaries of total mass @xmath14 . modelling the gw signal emitted by such systems",
    "poses a difficult theoretical problem because the observationally most `` useful '' part of the gravitational waveform is emitted in the last @xmath15 orbits of the inspiral , and during the `` plunge '' taking place after crossing the last stable circular orbit .",
    "the transition between ( adiabatic ) inspiral and plunge takes place in a regime where the two bodies are moving at relativistic speeds ( @xmath16 ) and where their gravitational interaction becomes ( nearly by definition ) highly non - linear ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "several authors ( notably @xcite ) have taken the view that the modelling of this crucial transition between inspiral and plunge is ( in the general case of comparable - mass systems ) beyond the reach of analytical tools and can only be tackled by ( possibly special - purpose @xcite ) numerical simulations . by contrast , other authors @xcite have introduced new `` resummation methods '' to improve the analytical description of the last few gw cycles near this transition and have argued that these resummed analytical results gave a reliable description of the gravitational physics near the transition .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to further the latter approach by generalizing the ( resummed ) `` effective one - body '' ( eob ) methods introduced in @xcite to the case of binary systems of _ spinning _ black holes . before doing this",
    ", we wish to clarify what is the rationale for arguing that the `` resummed '' analytical approach can describe the last stages of inspiral and the transition between inspiral and plunge .",
    "let us first recall that a lot of effort has been devoted in recent years to the analytical computing , by means of post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions in powers of @xmath18 , of the equations of motion , and the gw emission , of comparable - mass binary systems .",
    "the equations of motions have been computed to @xmath19 ( @xmath20  pn ) accuracy by two separate groups , @xcite and @xcite , and the two results have been shown to agree @xcite . until recently , there remained ( in both approaches ) an ambiguous parameter , @xmath21 , linked to the problem of regularizing some badly divergent integrals arising at the 3  pn level . in a recent work , using an improved regularization method ( dimensional continuation ) , the first group @xcite has succeeded in determining without ambiguity the value of @xmath21 , namely @xmath22 .",
    "this unique determination of the 3pn equations of motion is consistent with an old argument of @xcite showing that it should be possible to model black holes by point particles without ambiguity up to the 5  pn level ( excluded ) .",
    "the emission of gw is unambiguously known to @xmath23 ( @xmath24  pn ) accuracy @xcite , and has recently been formally computed to @xmath25 ( @xmath26  pn ) accuracy @xcite , modulo the appearance of several ambiguous parameters ( @xmath27 ) linked to the problem of regularizing some divergences arising at the 3pn level .",
    "dimensional regularization is expected to determine without ambiguity the values of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , but has not ( yet ) been applied to the radiation problem .",
    "we wish to emphasize that such high - order pn results are a _",
    "necessary _ , but _ not _ by themselves _",
    "sufficient _ , ingredient for computing with adequate accuracy the gravitational waveform of coalescing binaries .",
    "indeed , it was emphasized long ago @xcite that the pn series ( written as straightforward taylor series in powers of some parameter @xmath30 ) become slowly convergent in the late stages of binary inspiral .",
    "a first attempt was made in @xcite to improve the convergence of the pn - expanded equations of motion so as to determine the ( crucial ) location of the last stable ( circular ) orbit ( lso ) for comparable - mass systems .",
    "however , further work @xcite has shown the unreliability ( and coordinate - dependence ) of this attempt",
    ". there is , however , no reason of principle preventing the existence of gauge - invariant `` resummation methods '' able to give reliable results near the lso . indeed , as emphasized in @xcite and @xcite most coordinate - invariant functions ( of some invariant quantity @xmath31 ) that one wishes to consider when discussing the dynamics and gw emission of circular orbits are expected to have a singularity only at the `` light ring '' ( lr ) value of @xmath32 [ last possible _ unstable _ circular orbit ] .",
    "if we trust ( for orders of magnitude considerations ) the small mass - ratio limit ( @xmath33 ) , we know that @xmath34 is smaller by a factor 2 than @xmath35 . if the functions @xmath36 we are dealing with are meromorphic functions of @xmath32 , the location of the expected closest singularity @xmath37 determines their radius of convergence .",
    "therefore , we expect that , for @xmath38 , the taylor expansion of @xmath36 will converge and will behave essentially like @xmath39 . in particular",
    ", one expects @xmath40 .",
    "this heuristic argument suggests a rather slow convergence , but the crucial point is to have some convergence , so that the application of suitable _ resummation methods _ can be expected to accelerate the convergence and to lead to numerically accurate results from the knowledge of only a few terms in the taylor expansion .",
    "there exist many types of resummation methods and none of them are of truly universal applicability . as a rule",
    ", one must know something about the structure of the functions @xmath41 one is trying to resum to be able to devise an efficient resummation method",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have studied in detail the various functions that might be used to discuss the gw flux and the dynamics of binary systems .",
    "this work has led to selecting some specific resummation methods , acting on some specific functions . for what concerns",
    "the gw flux we refer to fig .",
    "3 of @xcite for evidence of the acceleration of convergence ( near the lso ) provided by a specific resummation method combining a redefinition of the _ gw flux _",
    "function with pad approximants .",
    "we wish here , for the benefit of the skeptics , to exhibit some of the evidence for the acceleration of convergence ( near the lso ) in the description of the 2-body _ dynamics _ provided , at the 3  pn level , by a resummation method defined by combining @xcite and @xcite . specifically , we mean the combination of the effective - one - body ( eob ) approach ( further discussed below ) and of a suitable pad resummation of the effective radial potential at the @xmath42  pn level : @xmath43 $ ] ( see below ) .",
    "let us consider a sequence of _ circular _ orbits , near the lso and for two non - spinning black holes . in the eob approach",
    "the circular orbits are obtained by minimizing a certain effective radial potential , defined by fixing the total orbital angular momentum @xmath44 in the hamiltonian .",
    "the most natural variable defining the one - parameter sequence of circular orbits is then simply the angular momentum @xmath44 .",
    "it is therefore natural , for the purpose of this work , to measure the separation between the two holes ( in a gauge - invariant and approximation - independent ) way by _ conventionally _ defining a @xmath45-radius @xmath46 , such that the ( invariantly defined ) total orbital angular momentum @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 , i.e. by the relation holding for a test particle in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "[ here , and in the following , we shall often set @xmath49 and/or @xmath50 , except in some ( final ) formulas where it might be illuminating to reestablish the dependence on @xmath51 and/or @xmath52 .",
    "] as the problem is to know whether the resummation method of the pn - expanded two - body dynamics is efficient , we compare in table  [ tab1 ] the total energies @xmath53 of the binary system , computed using 1  pn , 2  pn and 3  pn information , for circular orbits at @xmath45-radii @xmath54 , and 6 .",
    "we give the values of the binding energy per unit ( total ) mass , @xmath55 , for the equal - mass case ( @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ) .",
    ".binding energies @xmath58 for circular orbits of equal - mass ( non - spinning ) binary systems near the lso .",
    "the invariant dimensionless @xmath45-radius @xmath59 is defined in the text .",
    "the binding energy is computed from the pad - resummed effective - one - body hamiltonian at three successive post - newtonian approximations : 1  pn , 2  pn and 3  pn ( with @xmath22 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the most important conclusion we wish to draw from these results is that , when @xmath60 ( which , as we argued above , covers a large domain of the physically relevant cases ) , the binding energy at the lsso seems to be reliably describable by the simple analytical eob hamiltonian defined above .",
    "indeed , the differences between : ( i ) the non - spinning case and the spinning ones , and ( ii ) the 2  pn orbital approximation and the 3  pn one , are all quite moderate ( which indicates that the effective one - body approach is effective in resumming pn interactions near the lso ) .",
    "furthermore , the difference between : ( iii ) the spinning 3  pn case with @xmath61 @xcite , and the same case with @xmath62 @xcite is rather small .",
    "this is a testimony of the robustness of the eob approach .",
    "a change of its 3pn coefficient by @xmath63 does not affect much the physical predictions .",
    "this robustness at the 3pn level is indicative of some robustness against the addition of higher pn effects .",
    "note also ( from table  [ tab2 ] ) the confirmation that when @xmath64 , the binding energy at the lsso depends nearly only on the projected effective spin parameter @xmath65 , with a very weak dependence on the value of @xmath66 .",
    "on the other hand , it must be admitted that when , say , @xmath67 the differences between the three cases ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) become so large , and the radius of the lsso becomes so small , that the present spin - dependent eob predictions can not be quantitatively trusted .",
    "[ however , as discussed in more detail below , we think that they remain qualitatively correct . ]",
    "if the orbital dynamics were well described by the 2  pn - level orbital eob metric ( i.e. if @xmath21 had been near @xmath68 ; see upper curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the binding energy , even in such extreme cases , would differ only moderately from the non - spinning case , and we could trust the eob - plus - spin predictions .",
    "however , as @xmath21 is zero the 3  pn eob @xmath69 spin predictions become , for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , very different from the 2  pn ones and quite sensitive to the numerical values of the expansion coefficients entering the eob potentials .",
    "let us note , however , that in all cases ( even the most extremely spinning ones ) if the spin parameter @xmath72 is _ negative _ ( i.e. if the effective spin vector , whatever be its magnitude , has a negative projection on the orbital angular momentum ) the eob predictions become extremely reliable because all the differences between the cases ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) become quite small .",
    "all these results are easy to interpret physically .",
    "this can be seen from the basic equations of the eob approach which simplify so much the description of the physical interactions by representing them as slightly deformed versions of the well - known gravitational physics of test particles in schwarzschild or kerr geometries .",
    "indeed , the basic equation of the eob approach determining the binding of the lso is eq .",
    "( [ eq3.39 ] ) which differs from its well - known ) has never been written down before .",
    "usual treatments @xcite use the more complicated effective radial potential @xmath73 .",
    "anyway , the physics is the same , but it is more cleanly presented in ( [ eq3.39 ] ) . ]",
    "kerr limit ( i.e. @xmath74 ) only by the change [ eq3.43 ] a_k ( u , ^2 ) = 1 - 2 u + ^2 ^2 |a ( u , ^2 ) = p_3 ^ 1 [ 1 - 2 u + ^2 ^2 + 2 ^3 + a_4 ( ) ^4 ] . the crucial point ( which is , finally , the most important new information obtained by the 2  pn and 3  pn orbital calculations ) is that the 2  pn and 3  pn additional terms to the radial function @xmath75 have both _ positive _ coefficients .",
    "this means that , even before the addition of the effect of spin ( which leads to a @xmath76 additional term in @xmath77 , corresponding to the famous @xmath78 term in @xmath79 ) the main effect of non - linear orbital interactions for comparable masses is _ `` repulsive '' _ ,",
    "i.e. correspond to a partial screening of the basic schwarzschild attractive term @xmath80 by the addition of repulsive terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "now , paradoxically , the addition of a repulsive term leads to a more tightly bound lsso because the _ less attractive _ , but still attractive and @xmath83 to ensure that these functions qualitatively behave like @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( for @xmath86 ) , i.e. ( generically ) have a simple zero near @xmath87 , which means that the effective metric becomes `` infinitely attractive '' at some deformed horizon . ] , radial function @xmath88 will be able to `` hold '' a particle in spherical orbit down to a _",
    "lower _ orbit . in other words ,",
    "when a radial potential becomes less attractive , its lsso gets closer to the horizon , and the binding energy of the lsso becomes more negative .",
    "this being said , one understands immediately the additional effects due to the spin interaction .",
    "there are basically two such effects : ( a ) a linear `` spin - orbit '' effect linked to the @xmath89 term in ( [ eq3.39 ] ) ( with @xmath90 ) , and ( b ) a non - linear spin - quadratic modification of the metric coefficient , i.e. the additional @xmath91 term in @xmath92 ( or in @xmath93 ) .",
    "the crucial points are that : ( 1 ) when @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 ( coarse antialignment of angular momenta ) the dominant linear spin - orbit coupling is _ attractive _ and therefore pushes the lsso _ upwards _ , towards a less bound orbit , while , ( 2 ) when @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 ( coarse alignment of angular momenta ) _ both _ the linear spin - orbit coupling @xmath98 and the spin - quadratic additional term @xmath91 are _ repulsive _ and tend to draw the lsso _ downwards _ , i.e. closer to the horizon , in a more bound orbit .",
    "therefore we see that , when @xmath99 , all the new effects ( the @xmath8-dependent non - linear orbital interactions and the spin effects ) tend in the same direction : towards a closer , more bound orbit . as the existence of a lsso is due to a delicate balance between the attractive gravitational effects and the usual repulsive ( `` centrifugal '' ) effect of the orbital angular momentum ( i.e. the term @xmath100 in ( [ eq3.39 ] ) ) , when several attractive effects combine their action , they start having a large effect on the binding of the lsso .",
    "this is well - known to be the case for circular , equatorial , corotating @xmath101 orbits of a test particle in kerr , which feature , in the case of an extreme kerr @xmath102 an lso at @xmath103 , with @xmath104-fractional binding @xmath105 ( corresponding to @xmath106 ) .",
    "it is also well - known that , again for extreme kerr , a counterrotating @xmath107 circular , equatorial orbit in extreme kerr has an lso at @xmath108 , with @xmath104-fractional binding @xmath109 ( corresponding to @xmath110 ) . what is less well - known is that the extreme binding of the circular , equatorial , corotating lso around an extreme kerr is not representative of the binding of typical lsso s around typical ( or even extreme ) kerr holes . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath111 ( i.e. in more invariant language , when @xmath112 ) and when @xmath113 , the lsso is , in general , moderately perturbed away from the schwarzschild value @xmath114 and its binding is correspondingly moderately different from its schwarzschild limit @xmath115 .",
    "the present work has shown that the location of the lsso s for binary spinning holes can be rather simply obtained , in the eob approach , by balancing in the specific way of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.39 ] ) the centrifugal effect of the orbital angular momentum against the overall attractive effect of gravity , but with the critical addition of the 2  pn and 3  pn repulsive terms , of the spin - quadratic repulsive term , and of the indefinite - spin effect of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the last topic we wish to discuss concerns the expected result of the coalescence of two holes . in particular , we are interested in estimating the maximal spin that the final hole , resulting from the coalescence of two spinning holes , might have . it was estimated in @xcite ( by using the eob approach ) that the coalescence of two non - spinning holes of the same mass @xmath116 leads ( after taking into account the effect of gravitational radiation on the orbital evolution and on the loss of energy and angular momentum ) to the formation of a rotating black hole of mass @xmath117 and spin parameter @xmath118 [ we have included a factor @xmath119 in @xmath120 to take into account the energy loss during the ring - down . ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath121 .",
    "the fractional energy @xmath122 roughly corresponds to the ( adiabatically estimated ) lso binding energy ( @xmath123 in the 2  pn - based estimate of @xcite ) minus the energy per unit mass radiated during the plunge ( @xmath124 @xcite ) .",
    "we shall leave to future work a similar estimate , for the 3  pn - plus - spin case , of the amount of energy emitted in gw .",
    "we wish here to focus on the issue of the spin of the final hole .",
    "the above value @xmath125 is rather close to the maximal value @xmath126 and there arises the question of whether an eob treatment of the coalescence of two spinning holes might not formally predict a final value of @xmath127 larger than one ! by `` eob treatment ''",
    "we mean here a completed version of the eob approach ( as in @xcite at the 2  pn , non - spinning level ) obtained by : ( i ) adding a resummed radiation force to the `` conservative '' eob dynamics , and ( ii ) pushing the calculation of the eob evolution down to its point of unreliability ( near the last _ unstable _ orbit ) where it is matched to a perturbed - single - black - hole description .",
    "a zeroth approximation to this completed eob approach is the one we study in this paper : an adiabatic sequence of solutions of the conservative dynamics , terminated at the lso . in this approach",
    "one entirely neglects the losses of energy and angular momentum during the plunge phase following the crossing of the lso .",
    "the numbers recalled above show that the energy loss during the plunge ( and the ring - down ) is not negligible compared to the binding energy at the lso .",
    "however , for the present question this is not a problem .",
    "what is important is that the angular momentum loss during plunge is a very small fraction ( a percent or so ) of the angular momentum at the lso , and that the final mass of the black hole is nearly equal to @xmath128 .",
    "this leads us to the following zeroth order estimate of the spin parameter of the final hole : [ eq3.44 ] _ bh . in view of the exact conservation of @xmath129 in our conservative eob ( real ) dynamics",
    ", it is clear that it is @xmath130 which is a good measure of the total angular momentum of the final spacetime , i.e. of the final black hole .",
    "we are facing here a potential consistency problem of this simple - minded eob treatment : when computing ( [ eq3.44 ] ) for spinning configurations does one always get @xmath131 ?",
    "one might worry that , starting with a value of @xmath125 for non - spinning holes , the addition of large spins on the holes might quickly exceed the extremal limit .",
    "it is plausible that the most dangerous situation is the `` aligned case '' , where all the angular momenta , @xmath132 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are parallel ( or antiparallel ) . in this case the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.44 ] ) reads [ eq3.45 ] j^lsso = l_z^lsso + s_1 + s_2 , while the spin parameter of the effective metric reads [ eq3.46 ] a = _ p = = ( x_1 ^ 2 + ) _ 1 + ( x_2 ^ 2 + ) _ 2 . here , we consider @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 as algebraic numbers ( positive or negative ) .",
    "this allows us to investigate also the case where the spins might be antiparallel to @xmath137 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall only study the symmetric case where @xmath56 and @xmath138 .",
    "for this case [ eq3.47 ] a = _ p = _ 1 , and [ eq3.48 ] _ bh = = _ z^ lsso + _ 1 = _ z^lsso + _ p where the dimensionless orbital angular momentum @xmath139 is related to the dimensionless quantity ( when @xmath140 ) @xmath141 appearing in ( [ eq3.39 ] ) through [ eq3.49 ] _ z = | + .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even in the case where both holes are extreme ( @xmath142 the maximum value of the effective spin parameter is @xmath143 .",
    "we have numerically investigated the quantity @xmath127 , eq .",
    "( [ eq3.48 ] ) , as a function of the effective @xmath144 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for different values of the 3  pn parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we see that the final spin parameter reaches a maximum for a positive value of @xmath72 , i.e. for parallel ( rather than antiparallel ) spins . for the correct 3pn value @xmath22",
    "the maximum value of @xmath127 is comfortably below 1 : namely , @xmath145 , reached for @xmath146 .",
    "this is not much larger than the value @xmath147 obtained for @xmath148 .",
    "we find that this is a nice sign of the consistency of the eob approach .",
    "this consistency was not a priori evident .",
    "in fact for @xmath149 one gets a maximum value of @xmath127 slightly larger than 1 . in particular , note that the 2  pn treatment of the orbital dynamics ( obtained for @xmath150 ; upper curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) formally leads to problematic over - extreme values of @xmath127 .",
    "this may be interpreted as a confirmation of the need of `` repulsive '' 3  pn effects ( i.e. @xmath151 ) .",
    "it is ( a posteriori ! ) easy to understand physically why @xmath127 , after reaching a maximum , then decreases when one adds more spin on the two black holes .",
    "indeed , there is here a competition between two effects : adding spin on the holes ( i.e. increasing @xmath72 ) , on the one hand directly contributes to augmenting @xmath127 through the second term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.48 ] ) , but , on the other hand , indirectly contributes to reducing the total @xmath152 by reducing @xmath153 ( indeed , as we explained above , positive spin leads to an lso orbit closer to the horizon , and therefore with less orbital angular momentum ) . the first effect wins for smallish spins , while the second ( more non - linear ) effect wins for larger spins .",
    "we started by recalling the need of techniques for accelerating the convergence of the post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions in the last stages of the inspiral of binary systems .",
    "we summarized the evidence ( table  [ tab1 ] ) showing the remarkable convergence properties of the best current resummation technique : the effective one - body ( eob ) approach of refs .",
    "we showed how to generalize the eob approach to the case of two spinning black holes with comparable masses @xmath154 .",
    "as a first step towards computing the spin - dependent eob hamiltonian we constructed an effective metric , which can be viewed either as a @xmath8-deformation of the kerr metric or as a spin - deformation of the @xmath8-deformed effective metric .",
    "the effective spin entering this deformed kerr metric is @xmath155 .",
    "the introduction of this effective @xmath156 allows one to combine in a simple manner all ( pn leading ) spin - orbit coupling effects , and most of the spin - spin ones , with the rather complex but important 3  pn effects , which have been incorporated only recently in the eob approach @xcite .",
    "we have also constructed a more complicated modified effective hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.56 ] ) , which separately depends on two ( effective ) spin vectors , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , and which allows a ( hopefully ) more accurate representation of spin - spin effects .",
    "we recommend the simultaneous consideration of @xmath159 and @xmath160 to determine the domain of trustability of the presently constructed spin - dependent eob hamiltonian .",
    "namely , when @xmath161 and @xmath162 lead to numerically very similar evolutions , one is entitled to trusting them both ; while a significant difference in their predictions signals a breakdown of the trustability of the simple eob hamiltonian proposed here .",
    "the present paper has only investigated a few aspects of the physics predicted by our spin - generalized eob approach .",
    "in particular , as a first cut toward understanding the relevance of our construction for gravitational wave ( gw ) observations we have discussed the approximate existence of `` spherical orbits '' ( orbits with fixed radial coordinate , as in the kerr metric ) and we studied the binding energy of the last stable spherical orbits ( lsso ) .",
    "a message of this study is that , for most physically relevant cases ( in the parameter space where one randomly varies all angles and all spin values ) , the results are only weakly dependent on the exact numerical values of the 3pn coefficients .",
    "moreover , they exhibit moderate deviations from the non - spinning case ( see fig .  1 and table  ii ) .",
    "to give a numerical flavor of the effects of spin we note that , when the projected spin parameter @xmath163 , eq .",
    "( [ eq3.41 ] ) , is smaller than about @xmath164 , its effect on the fractional binding energy ( @xmath165 ) of the lsso is , approximately , [ eq4.1 ] 100 e^lsso - 1.43 _ 4 ( 1 + 0.168 _ 4 ) - 0.806 _ 4 ( 1 + 0.888 _ 4 ) _",
    "p , where @xmath166 . as in most cases ( random angles , random spin - kinetic energies )",
    "it is plausible that @xmath167 , we expect that spin effects will only modify the energy emitted as gravitational waves up to the lsso by less than about @xmath168 .    such an increase , though modest , is still a significant fractional modification of the corresponding energy loss predicted for non - spinning systems ( @xmath169 for @xmath170 ) .",
    "in fact , this effect might cause an important _ bias _ in the first observations . if the intrinsic spins of the holes can ( at all ) take large values , the highest signal - to - noise - ratio events in the first years of ligo observations might select binary systems with rather large and rather aligned spins .",
    "it is therefore important to include spin effects in the data analysis of coalescing black holes .",
    "we have argued that , in most cases , the simple - minded generalized eob approach presented here should be a reliable analytical tool for describing the dynamics of two spinning holes and for computing a catalogue of gravitational waveforms , to be used as matched filters in the detection of gw s .",
    "however , it must be admitted that , in the cases where the effective spin vector is coarsely ( positively ) aligned with the orbital angular momentum , and where the spins are so large that @xmath171 , the predictions from the above - introduced eob hamiltonian start predicting lsso radii so near the `` effective horizon '' where @xmath172 , that they can not be quantitatively relied upon .",
    "[ though i would still argue that they can be qualitatively trusted , in view of the simple physics they use ; see subsection  [ ssec3.3 ] .",
    "] we give some examples of that in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "in such cases the eob approach does predict much larger energy losses , possibly larger than @xmath173 . in these cases ,",
    "the uncertainty in the waveform may be so large that one may need the type of non - linear filtering search algorithm advocated in ref .",
    "we wish , however , to emphasize the differences between our treatment and conclusions and those of flanagan and hughes .",
    "these authors defined the `` merger '' phase as ( essentially ) what comes after the binary system crosses the non - spinning lso ( around 6  @xmath174 ) , and they assumed that the signal from the `` merger '' phase can only be obtained from numerical relativity .",
    "moreover , they optimistically assumed that ( in all cases ) @xmath173 are emitted in gw energy during the merger phase , and 3% during the subsequent ring - down phase .",
    "by contrast , our treatment is based on the idea that a suitable resummed version of the pn - expanded dynamics , namely the eob - plus - pad approach , can , in most cases , give an analytical handle on the computation of the inspiral signal down to the spin - modified lsso ( and even during the subsequent plunge , as discussed for the spinless case in @xcite ) .",
    "we have argued in several ways that the simple eob hamiltonian ( [ eq2.44 ] ) gives reliable answers in most cases , and allows one to analytically control the possible amplification ( or deamplification , when @xmath175 ) in gw energy loss due to spin effects .",
    "moreover , it is only in rather extreme cases that we could agree with @xcite in predicting @xmath176 energy losses . in most other cases ,",
    "we think that the eob method provides a reliable basis for computing families of wave forms that will be useful templates for the detection of gw s .",
    "another difference with @xcite is that we have argued , on the basis of definite computations , that the spin of the final hole will never become nearly extremal ( even if the initial spins are extremal ) .",
    "this is important for the data analysis of the ring - down signal , because the decay time of the least damped quasi - normal - mode starts becoming large only for near extremal holes .",
    "let us emphasize that the present work is only a first step toward an improved analytical understanding of the last stages of inspiral motion of two spinning compact object .",
    "the explicit spin - dependent hamiltonian ( [ eq2.44 ] ) ( or , better , @xmath177 defined at the end of section ii ) has only taken into account the leading effects ( in a pn expansion ) of the spin - dependent interactions .",
    "more work is needed to analytically determine more accurate versions of the eob hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to explicitly derive the next - to - leading ( 1  pn ) corrections to the eob spin - orbit ( and spin - spin ) interactions .",
    "furthermore , we have only provided a resummation of the conservative part of the dynamics .",
    "there remains the important complementary task of resumming the radiation reaction part .",
    "this was done in @xcite , using previous results of @xcite , only for the spinless case .",
    "once this is done , we expect , as in our previous study @xcite , that the presence of a lsso along the sequence of adiabatic orbits will be blurred and will be replaced by a continuous transition between inspiral and plunge .",
    "there remains also the task of studying the effects of spin - dependent interactions on the gravitational waveform emitted during the last stages of inspiral and during the plunge ( that we have not considered here ) .",
    "in other words , one needs to redo , by combining the eob approach with resummed versions of radiation reaction , the studies , valid far from the lso , which were based on straightforward pn - expanded results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that our result above about the primary importance of the single parameter @xmath72 , combined with the understanding @xcite that the number of `` useful '' cycles in the gw signal for massive binaries is rather small , suggests that a rather small number of `` spinning templates '' will be really needed in a matched filter data analysis . on the other hand",
    ", we recall that it was found in @xcite that the plunge signal ( but not the ring - down one , for stellar mass holes ) plays a significant role in the data analysis",
    ".    it will also be interesting to see , within the eob approach , the extent to which the non - linear spin - dependent interactions might , as has been recently suggested @xcite , lead to a chaotic dynamical evolution .",
    "we a priori suspect that two factors will diminish the significance of such chaotic evolutions : ( 1 ) they occur only in an improbably small region of phase space ( involving , in particular , large spins ) , and ( 2 ) their effect on the crucial gw phasing is rather small .",
    "it would be very useful to have independent means of testing the accuracy of the eob approach . at this stage",
    "we see only three ways of doing that ( beyond the performance of more internal checks of the robustness of the approach ) : ( i ) an analytical calculation of the 4  pn interaction hamiltonian , ( ii ) a comparison between numerical computations and the eob results , and/or ( iii ) a comparison between the eob predictions and the forthcoming gw observations .",
    "( i ) would be important for assessing the convergence of the pn - resummed eob hamiltonian . in view of the extreme difficulties involved in the 3  pn calculations",
    "@xcite it would seem hopeless to even mention the 4  pn level .",
    "but in fact , the eob approach itself suggests that the current methods used in pn calculations are highly inefficient , and unnecessarily complicated .",
    "indeed , as emphasized in @xcite the final , gauge - invariant content of the 3  pn result is contained in only three quantities @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , and only one of them , @xmath181 , is really important for determining the dynamics of inspiralling quasi - circular binaries . if one could invent a new approximation scheme which computes directly @xmath178 ( at 3  pn ) , it might be possible to compute its 4  pn counterpart , @xmath182 .",
    "( ii ) is not yet possible ( at least as a test of the eob hamiltonian ) because numerical computations use as initial data geometrical configurations that do not take into account most of the crucial physics incorporated in pn calculations .",
    "current numerical computations use somewhat ad hoc `` binary - black - hole - like '' data , often of the restricted spatially conformally flat type , without trying to match their initial data to the near lso configurations predicted by ( resummed ) analytical approaches . on the other hand ,",
    "let us stress that the value of the radial pn - expanded potential @xmath183 crucially depends on the non - linear gravitational interactions linked to the @xmath184 part of the spatial metric , i.e. to its non conformally flat part , and also to the non - linear interactions linked to the @xmath185 part of the gravitational field momenta .",
    "for instance already at the 2  pn level , the truncation of the einsteinian prediction for the two - body problem ( driven into a close orbit by a long past interaction involving retarded gw interactions ) corresponding to artificially assuming a conformally flat spatial metric changes the physically correct value @xmath186 into @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "[ it also slightly changes the energy map @xmath188 . ] for equal - mass systems , this corresponds to multiplying the positive @xmath189 by a factor @xmath190 .",
    "as we discussed above , this ( artificial ) increase of the `` repulsive '' character of the non - linear gravitational interactions tends to artificially increase the binding of the lso .",
    "as the 2pn coefficient is anyway too small to have a large impact on the lso characteristics , this 2pn change does not , by itself , change much the lso energy @xcite . however , if this tendency to increase the `` repulsive '' character of the pn expansion ( caused by the neglect of the @xmath184- , and @xmath185-dependent interactions ) persists at the ( numerically more important ) 3pn level , this might explain the current discrepancy between analytical and numerical estimates of lso characteristics .",
    "in fact , we note that the initial data taken by a recent attempt @xcite at fulfilling the proposal of @xcite to start a full numerical calculation only at the moment where it is really needed , i.e. after crossing the lso , uses lso initial data @xcite with a binding energy @xmath191 which is 38% larger than the value @xmath192 obtained at 3  pn ( with @xmath22 ) by analytical estimates . similarly , the lso orbital period of the initial data of @xcite is @xmath193 @xcite , which is twice smaller than the 3  pn estimate @xmath194 @xcite ! these discrepancies between state - of - the - art numerical lso initial data and state - of - the - art analytical estimates of lso data are significantly larger than the natural `` theoretical error bar '' on the ( resummed ) analytical estimates ( derived , say , by comparing 2pn estimates to 3pn ones ) .",
    "[ see , however , the new numerical approach of @xcite whose lso data agree well with the 3  pn eob estimates @xcite . ] in our opinion , this makes it urgent for the numerical relativity community to develop ways of constructing initial data that correctly incorporates the crucial non - linear physics ( linked to the @xmath184 and @xmath185 parts of the metric ) which is taken into account in pn calculations .",
    "if a significant discrepancy remains after this is done , one will be entitled to blame the lack of convergence of the eob - resummed pn calculations .",
    "if one finds agreement , this will be a confirmation of the claim made here that the pad - improved eob is a reliable description of the last orbits before coalescence .",
    "once one succeeds in matching analytical and numerical results for non - spinning black holes , it will be very interesting to use numerical data on fast - spinning black holes to refine the eob hamiltonian by fitting the values of the extra parameters which can be introduced in the eob hamiltonian to represent higher pn effects . in the long term",
    "we expect that such a complementarity between numerical and analytical tools will be needed for defining a sufficiently dense set of gw templates .",
    "[ in view of the large dimensionality of the parameter space of the two spinning hole system , it seems hopeless to use only numerical techniques to define a dense network of templates . ]    finally , even if no decisive progress is made on ( i ) or ( ii ) before the first sources are detected , there remains the possibility that the first observations might confirm the soundness of ( or suggest specific modifications of ) the eob - based waveforms , and thereby facilitate further detections by narrowing the bank of templates .",
    "for instance , one might include a 4pn contribution @xmath195 to @xmath196 , as a free parameter in constructing a bank of templates , and wait until ligo / virgo / geo get high signal - to - noise - ratio observations of massive coalescing binaries to determine its numerical value .",
