    "a number of information - centric networking ( icn ) architectures have been proposed to improve the performance and the end - user experience of the internet @xcite .",
    "icn architectures focus on ( 1 ) enabling access to content and services by name , rather than by original location ; ( 2 ) protecting content rather than links or connections ; and ( 3 ) exploiting in - network storage of content .    a leading approach in icn architectures can be characterized as _",
    "interest - based content - centric networking _ and is the focus of this paper .",
    "directed diffusion @xcite is one of the first examples of this approach .",
    "requests for named content ( called interests ) are diffused throughout a sensor network , and data matching the interests are sent back to the issuers of interests .",
    "subsequent proposals ( e.g. , direct @xcite ) use a similar approach in manets subject to connectivity disruption .",
    "nodes use opportunistic caching of content and flood interests persistently .",
    "the limitation of directed diffusion and other similar approaches is the need to flood the network with interests , an approach that can not be applied at internet scale .",
    "the original ccn proposal @xcite was the first example of an interest - based content - centric architecture applicable to wired networks in which interests do not state the identity of the sender . today , ndn @xcite and ccn @xcite are the leading proposals for content - centric networking based on interest forwarding .",
    "in general , an interest - based forwarding strategy consists of : populating forwarding information bases ( fib ) of routers with routes to name prefixes denoting content , sending content requests ( called interests ) for specific named data objects ( ndo ) over paths implied by the fibs , and delivering content along the reverse paths traversed by interests .",
    "section  [ sec - prev ] summarizes the operation of the forwarding strategies of ndn and ccn .",
    "the designers of ndn and ccn have argued @xcite that an interest stating a name of requested content and a nonce or unique identifier can be forwarded correctly towards an intended node advertising the content name , that routers can aggregate interests so that a router can forward an interest for the same content only once , and that interest loops can be detected whenever they occur .",
    "however , no prior work has been reported proving these claims .",
    "section  [ sec - loop ] demonstrates that the forwarding strategies of the original ccn and ndn architectures @xcite do not work correctly , in that some interests may never return data objects to the consumers who issued the interests , even if the content does exist in the network , the network topology and routing are stable , and all transmissions are successful .",
    "more importantly , it is also shown that there is no correct forwarding strategy with interest aggregation and interest - loop detection based on the matching of interest - identification data carried in interests . in this context",
    ", interest - identification data can be names of requested content , nonces , unique identifiers , or the path traversed by an interest .",
    "section  [ sec - design ] introduces the strategy for interest forwarding and aggregation with hop - counts ( sifah ) , which is the first interest - based forwarding strategy shown to be correct .",
    "sifah operates by having fibs store the next hops _ and _ number of hops to named content , and by forwarding each interest based on the name of the requested content and a hop count from the forwarding router to the requested content .",
    "a router accepts to forward an interest only if the hop count stated in the interest is larger than the hop count from the router to the content as stated in its fib .",
    "similarly , a router that has forwarded an interest for a given ndo accepts to aggregate an interest it receives while waiting for the requested ndo only if the hop count stated in the interest is larger than the hop count of the interest sent by the router .",
    "section  [ sec - correct ] proves that sifah works correctly when interest loops occur and interests are aggregated .",
    "section  [ sec - perf ] analyzes the storage requirements of sifah and ndn and shows that sifah is a more desirable approach than using nonces to attempt to detect interest loops .",
    "furthermore , it presents simulation results based on the unmodified implementation of the ndn forwarding strategy and our implementation of sifah in ndnsim .",
    "the simulation results help to illustrate that consumers submitting interests must receive ndo messages or negative acknowledgments ( nack ) when sifah is used , while some interests may go unanswered in ndn and the original ccn design due to undetected interest loops , even in stable topologies with correct entries in fibs .",
    "furthermore , the results indicate that interest loops increase the number of pit entries and end - to - end delays experienced by consumers even when interest loops are rare .",
    "in ndn and ccn , a given router @xmath0 uses three primary data structures to implement any of the forwarding strategies defined for interest - based content - centric architectures : a forwarding information base ( @xmath1 ) , a pending interest table ( @xmath2 ) , and a content store ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the forwarding strategy determines the interaction among @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 needed to forward interests towards nodes advertising having copies of requested content , send ndos back to consumers who requested them over reverse paths traversed by interests , and send any other signal indicating the inability to satisfy an interest .",
    "@xmath1 is used to route incoming interests to the appropriate next hops towards the desired content producer advertising a content prefix name @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath1 is populated using content routing protocols or static routes and matches interest names stating a specific ndo @xmath5 to @xmath1 entries of prefix names using _ longest prefix match_.    @xmath2 serves as a cache of interest state , such that content objects that satisfy interests may follow the reverse interest path back to the original requester .",

    "algorithm [ algo - ndn - fw ] does not include the probing of neighbors proposed in ndn , given that this aspect of ndn is still being defined @xcite .",
    "routers forward nacks received from those neighbors to whom they sent interests , unless the pit entries have expired or do not match the information provided in the nacks .",
    "the ndn forwarding strategy augments the original ccn strategy by introducing negative acknowledgements ( nack ) sent in response to interests for a number of reasons , including : routers identifying congestion , routers not having routes in their fibs to the requested content , or interest loops being detected .",
    "algorithms 1 and 2 indicate the use of nacks that is not part of the original ccn design by  * [ ndn]*. \"",

    "if a nonce and path traversed by the interest are used , deciding whether an interest has not traversed a loop can be based on whether @xmath31 \\not= id_j(s)[nonce ] \\vee i \\not\\in id_j(s)[path]$ ] . however , including path information in interests reveals the identity of originators of interests .",
    "the key aspect of the forwarding strategies that have been proposed for ndn and ccn is that a router determines whether or not an interest is a duplicate interest based solely on the content name and interest - identification data for the interest ( a nonce in ndn s case ) . to discuss the correctness of the forwarding strategy and other strategies",
    ", we define an interest loop as follows .",
    "an interest loop of @xmath32 hops for ndo with name @xmath5 occurs when one or more interests asking for @xmath5 are forwarded and aggregated by routers along a cycle @xmath33 @xmath34 such that router @xmath35 receives an interest for ndo @xmath5 from @xmath36 while waiting for a response to the interest it has forwarded to @xmath37 for the same ndo , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . @xmath41    according to the ndn forwarding strategy , a router can select a neighbor to forward an interest if it is known that it can bring content and its performance is ranked higher than other neighbors that can also bring content .",
    "the ranking of neighbors is done by a router independently of other routers , which can result in long - term routing loops implied by the fibs if the routing protocol used in the control plane does not guarantee instantaneous loop freedom ( e.g. , nlsr @xcite ) .",

    "it thus follows that no node in @xmath71 can successfully use the matching of interest - identification data to detect that interests for @xmath5 are being sent and aggregated along @xmath71 and the theorem is true .",
    "the results in theorems 1 and 2 can also be proven by mapping the interest processing strategy of ndn , and any forwarding strategy that attempts to detect interest loops by matching interest - identification data , to the problem of distributed termination detection over a cycle , where interests serve as the tokens of the algorithm @xcite . because interest aggregation erases a token traversing the ring ( interest loop ) when any node in the ring has previously created a different token , correct termination detection over the ring ( i.e. , interest loop detection )",
    "can not be guaranteed in the presence of interest aggregation .",
    "obviously , a loop traversed by an interest can be detected easily if each interest is identified with the route it should traverse .",
    "this is easy to implement but requires routers in the network to have complete topology information ( e.g. , @xcite ) or at least path information or partial topology information ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , carrying the path traversed by an interest in its header also ensures that an interest loop is detected if it occurs . in these two cases ,",
    "however , there is no need for using nonces to detect interest loops .",
    "more importantly , path information reveals the identity of the source router requesting content and hence defeats one of the key objectives of the ndn and ccn forwarding strategies .",
    "another view of the problem would be to say that interest aggregation is not common and hence undetected interest loops should be too rare to cause major performance problems . however ,",
    "if interests need not be aggregated , then very different architectures could be designed for content - centric networking that do not require using pits .",
    "it is clear from the results in the previous section that using nonces or identifying interests uniquely is useless for interest - loop detection when interests are aggregated , and that source routing of interests or including the path traversed by an interest are not desirable .",
    "accordingly , for an interest forwarding strategy to be correct in the presence of interest aggregation , it must be the case that , independently of the identity of an interest or how interests for the same content are aggregated , at least one router detects that it is traversing a path that is not getting the interest closer to a node that has advertised the requested content .",
    "ensuring that at least one router in an interest loop detects the incorrect forwarding of the interest can be attained if interests were to carry any type of ordering information that can not be erased by the use of interest aggregation .",
    "fortunately , distance information for advertised name prefixes is exactly this type of ordering information .",
    "given that forwarding information bases ( fib ) are populated from the routing tables maintained in the control plane of a network , they constitute a readily - available tool to establish the proper interaction between the forwarding strategy operating in the data plane and the distances to advertised content prefixes maintained by the routing protocol operating in the control plane .",
    "this is the basis of the _ strategy for interest forwarding and aggregation with hop - counts _ ( sifah ) .",
    "a router maintains a fib , a pit , and an optional content store .",
    "@xmath17 is indexed using content name prefixes .",
    "the fib entry for prefix @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath18 , and consists of a list of one or more tuples .",
    "each tuple states a next hop to @xmath4 and a hop count to the prefix .",
    "the set of next hops to @xmath4 listed in @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "the hop count to @xmath4 through neighbor @xmath86 is denoted by @xmath87 .",

    "an ndo message sent in response to the interest @xmath90 @xmath91 $ ] is denoted by @xmath92 $ ] , and states the name of the interest , a signature payload @xmath16 used to validate the content object , and the object itself .",
    "the nack sent by router @xmath7 in response to an interest is denoted by @xmath93 $ ] where @xmath27 states the reason why the nack is sent .",
    "possible reasons for sending a nack include : ( a ) an interest loop is detected , ( b ) a route failed towards the requested content , ( c ) no content is found , and ( d ) the pit entry expired .    @xmath21 is indexed using ndo names .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the entry created in @xmath21 for ndo with name @xmath5 , and specifies : the name of the ndo ; the hop count @xmath94 assumed by router @xmath7 when it forwards interest @xmath95 $ ] ; the set of incoming neighbors from which interests for @xmath5 are received ( @xmath96 ) ; the set of outgoing neighbor(s ) ( @xmath97 ) to whom router @xmath7 forwards its interest ; and the remaining lifetime for the interest ( @xmath98 ) .      to define a correct forwarding strategy , special attention must be paid to the fact that updates made to the fibs stored at routers occur independently of and concurrently with the updates made to their pits .",
    "for example , once a router has forwarded an interest that assumed a given distance to content prefix @xmath99 and waits for its interest to return a data object , its distance to the same content may change based on updated to its fib .",
    "hence , simply comparing the minimum distance from a router to content against a distance to content stated in an interest is not enough to ensure that interests are not incorrectly forwarded to routers that are farther away form the requested content .",
    "sifah takes into account the fact that fibs and pits are updated independently by requiring that a router that forwards an interest for a given piece of content remembers in its pit entry the value of the distance to content assumed when it issues its interest .",
    "the following rule is then used for a given router to determine whether an interest may be propagating over an interest loop .",
    "the number of hops to requested content is used as the metric for the invariant condition .",
    "this is done for two reasons , storing hop - count distances in the fib incurs less storage overhead than storing complex distance values , and the next hops to a prefix stored in the fib can be ranked based on the actual distances to content .",

    "this result is independent of whether interests are aggregated or sent over one or multiple paths , or how interests are retransmitted .",
    "similar forwarding rules based on more sophisticated lexicographic orderings could be defined based on the same general approach stated in hfar .",
    "the requirement for such forwarding rules is that more information needs to be maintained in the fibs , such as distance values to name prefixes that take into account such factors as end - to - end delay , reliability , cost , or bandwidth available .",
    "hfar is very similar to sufficient conditions for loop - free routing introduced in the past , in particular sufficient conditions for loop - free routing based on diffusing computations @xcite .",
    "indeed , the approach we introduce for interest - loop detection in sifah can be viewed as a case of termination detection based on diffusing computations @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that , because hfar is not _",
    "necessary _ to detect loops , there are cases in which hfar is not satisfied even though no interest loops exist .",
    "however , prior results on multi - path routing based on diffusing computations @xcite indicate that this does not constitute a performance problem . given that fibs are updated to reflect correct hop counts , or correct complex distance values in general",

    "this results in the aggregation of interests at node c1 for interests generated by c2 , and the aggregation of interests at node c2 for interests generated by c1 .",
    "our simple scenarios provide enough insight on the negative impact of undetected interest loops in the presence of interest aggregation using ndn and the original ccn design .",
    "simulation results are shown for three different forwarding strategies : the original ccn , ndn , and sifah .",

    "when no interest loops are present , ndn , ccn and sifah exhibit the same performance , with each having an average pit entry pending time of 60 msec .",
    "this should be expected , given that interests and ndo messages traverse shortest paths between consumers and producers or caches .",
    "the average pit entry pending time in sifah does not increase as he percentage of interests that encounter interest loops increases .",
    "the reason for this is that sifah ensures that an interest must elicit either an ndo message or a nack to be sent back from some router along the route it traverses back to the consumer that originates the interest .",
    "hence , the average amount of time an interest entry spends in the pit is a function of the round - trip time it takes for either an ndo message or a nack to evict it from the pit .",
    "this is proportional to a round - trip time between a consumer and a router with the content or a router at which hfar is not satisfied , which is a few milliseconds in the grid topology .",
    "by contrast , the average pit entry pending time in ccn and ndn increases dramatically with the percentage of interests that encounter interest loops .",
    "the percentage of interests that traverse loops need not be large to have negative performance consequences .",
    "for the scenario in which 10% of the interests encounter interest loops , we observe that the average pit entry pending time increases dramatically in ndn and ccn , with the average pit entry pending time being 113 msec , which is about twice the average pit entry pending time in sifah .    the results for ndn and ccn can be easily explained .",
    "ccn simply deletes and drops duplicate interests , each interest that encounters an interest loop is discarded by the router that detects a duplicate interest , and this action forces the corresponding pit entries in the routers traversed by the interest to remain in those pits , until their pit entry expiration timers expire . in ndn",
    ", interest loops can go undetected with aggregation and therefore no nacks are sent in those cases . as a result , the time an interest entry spends in the pit equals the pit entry expiration time if the interest traverses an undetected loop .",
    "the results are almost the same for ccn and ndn .",
    "the reason for observing slightly lower values for ndn compared to ccn , is that some of the interests for content in @xmath187 are not generated by c1 and c2 with sufficient time correlation to enable interest aggregation , which results in detection of interest loops in ndn and interests being discarded in ccn .",
    "the pit entry pending times in ndn and ccn are many orders of magnitude larger for interests that traverse undetected interest loops .",
    "this is unavoidable , given that the pit entry pending time is proportional to a pit entry expiration time , which by design must be set conservatively to values that are far longer than average round - trip times between consumers and producers . in the simulations , the pit entry expiration time is just one second .",
    "figure  [ pitsize ] shows the average size of pit tables in terms of number of entries for a router included in interest flows for five different scenarios comparing ccn , ndn , and sifah .",
    "ccn , ndn and sifah have exactly the same pit size in the absence of interest loops , which is expected . as the percentage of interests that encounter loops increases",
    ", the average number of entries in the pits increases dramatically for ccn and ndn . for the case in which only 10% of interests encounter loops , the number of entries doubles in ndn and ccn compared to sifah . for the case in which 100% of interests encounter loops , the average number of pit entries in ccn and ndn is 1889 and 1884 , respectively , while the number of pit entries in sifah actually decreases .",
    "the reason for the decrease in average number of pit entries for sifah as the percentage of interests that encounter loops increases is a consequence of the shorter round - trip times between the consumers submitting interests and the routers sending nacks compared to the round - trip times of paths to the producers of requested content .",
    "figure  [ rtt ] shows the average round - trip time ( rtt ) for all five scenarios for ccn , ndn and sifah . in the simulation experiments , the round - trip time is considered to be the time elapsed from the instant when an interest is first sent to the instant when an ndo message or a nack is received by the consumer who created the interest .    for the case of no loops , ccn , ndn , and sifah",
    "have the same average rtt .",
    "when the percentage of interests traversing loops is 10% , the average rtt in ccn and ndn increases to almost two times the average rtt in sifah , and some interests have much larger rtts than the average . as the percentage of interests that loop increases",
    ", the average rtt becomes proportional to the pit entry expiration time , which is to be expected .",
    "the average rtt in sifah decreases as more interests traverse loops , which is a result of the shorter rtts between consumers and routers sending the nacks .",
    "the simulation experiments we have presented are meant only to help illustrate the negative impact of undetected interest loops when they occur , rather than to provide representative scenarios of the performance of interest - based forwarding strategies in large networks .",
    "our results illustrate that loops in fibs need not be long lasting or impact a large percentage of interest to cause the number of stored pit entries and end - to - end delays to increase quickly .",
    "as we have shown , the pit storage requirements for sifah are smaller than those for the original ccn and ndn forwarding strategies .",
    "thus , sifah is more efficient than ccn and ndn even in the absence of interest loops . given that sifah is so easy to implement in the context of ccn and ndn , it makes practical sense to eliminate the current practice in ndn and ccn of attempting to detect interest loops by the matching of nonces and interest names , which does not work .",
    "we showed that the forwarding strategies in ndn and the original ccn architectures may fail to detect interest loops when they occur , and that a correct forwarding strategy that supports interest aggregation can not be designed simply by identifying each interest uniquely and deciding that there is an interest loop based on the matching of interest names and nonces .",
    "we introduced the strategy for interest forwarding and aggregation with hop - counts ( sifah ) .",
    "it is the first interest - based forwarding strategy shown to be correct in the presence of interest loops , interest aggregation , faults , and the forwarding of interests over multiple paths .",
    "sifah operates by requiring that fibs store the next hops and the hop count through such hops to named content , and by having each interest state the name of the content requested and the hop count from the relaying router to the content .",
    "we showed that sifah incurs less storage overhead than using nonces to identify interests .",
    "we also showed that , if ndn or the original ccn design is used in a network , the number of pit entries and end - to - end delays perceived by consumers can increase substantially with just a fraction of interests traversing undetected loops .",
    "although our simulation experiments assumed a very small network , our results provide sufficient insight on the negative effects of undetected interest loops in ndn and the original ccn design .",
    "this work is just a first step in the definition of correct interest - based forwarding strategies , and it is applicable to any interest retransmission approach . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that content consumers are in charge of interest retransmissions and that routers do not provide local repair of interests after receiving nacks or detecting link failures .",
    "the design of an efficient interest retransmission strategy and determining whether interest retransmissions by routers improves performance are arguably the most important next steps .",
    "however , sifah provides the necessary foundation to define a correct retransmission strategy , because it guarantees that each interest results in an ndo message or a nack being sent to the consumer who originated the interest .",
    "more work is also needed to understand the performance of sifah in large networks , the effect of pit entry expiration timers on performance , the effect of load balancing of interests over multiple available routes to content , the impact of local repairs in interest forwarding , and the performance implications of the interaction between sifah and a routing protocol that guarantees loop - free routing tables ( and hence fibs ) at all times @xcite compared to one that does not @xcite ."

    "<S> we show that the mechanisms used in the name data networking ( ndn ) and the original content centric networking ( ccn ) architectures may not detect interest loops , even if the network in which they operate is static and no faults occur . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that no correct interest forwarding strategy can be defined that allows interest aggregation and attempts to detect interest looping by identifying interests uniquely . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce sifah ( strategy for interest forwarding and aggregation with hop - counts ) , the first interest forwarding strategy shown to be correct under any operational conditions of a content centric network . </S>",
    "<S> sifah operates by having forwarding information bases ( fibs ) store the next hops and number of hops to named content , and by having each interest state the name of the requested content and the hop count from the router forwarding an interest to the content . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of simulation experiments using the ndnsim simulator comparing ccn and ndn with sifah . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these experiments illustrate the negative impact of undetected interest looping when interests are aggregated in ccn and ndn , and the performance advantages of using sifah . </S>"
