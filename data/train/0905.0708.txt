    "the final state of a gravitational collapse is expected to be described by a black hole and not by a naked singularity . moreover , at late times , the system should settle down to a stationary regime and since the kerr black hole is expected to be the only stationary black hole in vacuum , the final state of all possible gravitational collapses should approach to a kerr black hole . for simplicity , in this discussion",
    "we are not considering electromagnetic fields and also we are assuming that at some finite time all the matter fields have fallen into the black hole .",
    "the above considerations roughly encompass what is known as the standard picture of the gravitational collapse which , in particular , includes the weak cosmic censorship conjecture . to prove that this heuristic picture is in fact",
    "a consequence of the einstein field equations is one of the most relevant open problems in classical general relativity .",
    "one fruitful strategy to study some aspects of this problem is the following . from the heuristic picture presented above it is possible to deduce some geometric inequalities on the initial conditions for gravitational collapse .",
    "hence , initial conditions that violate these inequalities would automatically provide counter examples for the validity of the standard picture of the gravitational collapse .",
    "in fact , the original intention of this strategy , proposed first by penrose @xcite , was to construct such counter examples .",
    "however it was not possible to find them .",
    "it was then natural trying to prove these inequalities .",
    "such proofs provide an indirect but highly non trivial evidence that the heuristic picture of the gravitational collapse is correct ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of inequalities are also interesting by themselves because they provide unexpected mathematical connections between geometric quantities .    a prominent example of this idea is the penrose inequality which relates the mass with the area of the black hole horizon on the initial conditions .",
    "an important special case of this inequality has been proved in @xcite @xcite ( see also the review article @xcite ) .",
    "another example of this kind of inequalities is the inequality between mass and angular momentum .",
    "this inequality , which constitute the main subject of the present article , arises as follows .",
    "consider an axially symmetric gravitational collapse .",
    "an important feature of axial symmetry is that axially symmetric waves can not carry angular momentum . in other words : in vacuum , angular momentum is a conserved quantity in axial symmetry .",
    "let us assume that the heuristic picture presented above is correct .",
    "denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 the mass and angular momentum of the final kerr black hole .",
    "the kerr black hole satisfies the inequality @xmath2 the kerr solution is well defined for any choice of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it defines however a black hole only if inequality is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the total mass and total angular momentum of the initial conditions .",
    "since gravitational waves carry positive mass we have @xmath5 ( this inequality is of course also valid without the assumption of axial symmetry ) . and because angular momentum is conserved in axial symmetry we have @xmath6 .",
    "hence , in order to reach the inequality at a late time , every initial condition for axially symmetric collapse must satisfy @xmath7 see @xcite for a more detailed physical discussion .",
    "this inequality involves only quantities defined on the initial conditions .",
    "it is expected to hold for every axially symmetric vacuum ( not necessarily stationary ) black hole .",
    "the inequality was studied in a series of articles @xcite @xcite @xcite and finally proved for the case of one black hole in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there exists however no proof for the case of multiple axially symmetric black holes .",
    "this problem appears to be deeper ( and considerable more difficult ) than the single black hole case . in particular ,",
    "it is related , as we discuss below , with the still open problem of the uniqueness of the kerr black hole among stationary black holes with disconnected horizons .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to provide numerical evidence for the validity of for multiple black holes .",
    "a naive method to test is to take some configuration of axially symmetric black holes and compute numerically the mass and the angular momentum of it . for a given configuration",
    "the relevant parameters are the separation distance between the black holes and the individual angular momentum of them .",
    "but , of course , these parameters ( or any other finite set of parameters ) do not characterize uniquely the initial conditions .",
    "there exists infinitely many configurations with the same parameters , this essentially corresponds to the freedom of including gravitational waves surrounding the black holes .",
    "then , either we find a counter example or this naive method will give a very poor evidence in favor of .",
    "just some isolated points in the space of all possible initial conditions .",
    "fortunately a different approach is possible .",
    "it is based on the variational principle for the inequality presented in @xcite .",
    "this variational principle states that the minimum of the mass of a given configuration with fixed angular momentum is achieved by the associated ( i.e. with the same parameters ) stationary and axially symmetric solution of einstein equations .",
    "hence , in order to prove the inequality for a given configuration it is enough to compute the mass of the corresponding stationary and axially symmetric solution of einstein equations , which is characterized by the separation distance and individual angular momentum of the black holes .",
    "the stationary and axially symmetric einstein equations are non linear elliptic equations . in this article",
    ", we use a heat flow to numerically solve them .",
    "this parabolic flow has two important properties , first for arbitrary data it converges ( as time goes to infinity ) to a stationary and axially symmetric solutions of einstein equations .",
    "second , the mass is monotonically decreasing along the evolution and the angular momentum is conserved ( under appropriate boundary conditions ) .",
    "hence , the flow provides an accurate procedure for computing the minimum of the mass of each possible configuration .",
    "this method is interesting by itself as a method for solving numerically the stationary axially symmetric einstein equations with prescribed boundary conditions , which , up to the best of our knowledge , have not been used so far .    for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to configurations with only two black holes , although our method applies for any number of black holes .",
    "for this configuration , the most favorable case to violate the inequality is when the black holes have the same angular momentum pointing in the same direction .",
    "this corresponds to a repulsive spin - spin force between them .",
    "this is also the most favorable case for reaching a stationary solution representing two black holes at equilibrium , because it is in principle conceivable that the repulsive spin force balance the gravitational attraction .",
    "this configuration has only two parameters , the separation distance and the angular momentum .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , due to the scale invariance of the equations we have only one non trivial parameter , which we chose to be the separation distance .",
    "we can compute the mass for every choice of the separation distance and plot a curve . from the shape of the curve it is clear that , although we can compute only a finite range , the inequality will be satisfied for every separation distance .",
    "for other configurations we proceed in similar way .",
    "then , we obtain fairly strong numerical evidences that the inequality is satisfied for two black holes with any separation distances and any angular momentum .",
    "as we mention above , the heat flow relaxes to a solution of the stationary and axially symmetric einstein vacuum equations .",
    "an important open problem in general relativity is whether the kerr black hole is unique among stationary black holes ( see the recent article @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "this is essentially the same problem as whether is possible to achieve an equilibrium configuration of multiple black holes in general relativity .",
    "this problem have been studied in @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite . for some limit cases and also for cases with reflection symmetry it has been proved that equilibrium is not possible .",
    "also , from a different perspective , the problem has been studied using exact solutions in @xcite .",
    "again , the conclusion was that equilibrium is not possible for this class of solutions . using the heat flow , in this article we also provide numerical evidences that there is no regular equilibrium solution for two extreme black holes .",
    "this case has not been analyzed previously in the literature .",
    "the plan of the article is the following . in section [ sec : vari - probl - parab ]",
    "we introduce the heat flow and analyze its main properties .",
    "we also discuss the precise form of the conjecture regarding inequality and its relation with the black hole equilibrium problem mentioned above . in section [ sec : techniques ] we discuss the numerical techniques used to solve the parabolic heat flow equations . in section [ sec : results ]",
    "we present our results and in section [ sec : conclusion ] we give some further perspective on the open problems .",
    "finally , for the sake of completeness , we include an appendix [ sec : extr - kerr - solut ] with the explicit form of the extreme kerr solution used in our computations .",
    "consider a vacuum , axially symmetric spacetime .",
    "the axial killing vector defines two geometrical scalars , the square of its norm @xmath8 and the twist potential @xmath9 .",
    "these scalars characterize the spacetime in the following sense .",
    "take a foliation of cauchy surfaces on the spacetime with the corresponding time function .",
    "an initial data set for the spacetime is determined by the value of the functions @xmath10 and the time derivatives @xmath11 on a cauchy surface . the einstein evolution equations essentially reduce to a non - linear system of wave equations for @xmath10 . in appropriate coordinates",
    ", the total mass @xmath3 of the spacetime can be written as a positive integral on a cauchy surface in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this integral is the non linear and conserved energy of the system of waves equations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "an initial data set is called `` momentary stationary '' if @xmath11 vanished .",
    "stationary data are a particular class of momentary stationary data for which the scalars @xmath12 satisfy a set of elliptic equations ( see equations ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) below ) . an important feature of the mass integral is that , for arbitrary data , the associated momentary stationary data has less or equal mass .",
    "that is , there exists a lower bound for the mass that can be written in terms only on @xmath10 and no time derivatives @xmath11 are involved .",
    "this lower bound for the mass plays a key role in order to reduce the proof of the inequality ( [ eq:14a ] ) to a pure variational problem .",
    "it can be written as an integral in @xmath13 as follows ( for details see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be cartesian coordinates in @xmath13 ( denoted also by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and let @xmath18 be the associated cylindrical coordinates defined by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the positions of the black holes will be prescribed by a finite collection of points @xmath21 located at the @xmath22 axis .",
    "more precisely , the points @xmath21 will represent extra asymptotic ends on the spacetime and they can be associated with the location of the black holes . for a given set of @xmath23 points",
    "@xmath21 we define the separation intervals @xmath24 , @xmath25 , to be the open sets in the axis between @xmath21 and @xmath26 , and we define @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "let @xmath31 be the length of @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "see figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the length @xmath31 ( which are measured with respect to the cartesian coordinates introduced above ) will be associated with the separation distance between the black holes ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .    from the square norm @xmath8 of the killing vector",
    "we define the following function @xmath32 @xmath33 the lower bound of the mass is given by the following functional @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the volume element of @xmath13 , @xmath36 denotes partial derivatives with respect to cartesian coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath37 . as we mentioned above , for",
    "an arbitrary axially symmetric initial data @xmath38 with mass @xmath3 we have that ( see @xcite ) @xmath39    the angular momentum @xmath40 of the end @xmath21 is given by @xmath41 the total angular momentum is defined by @xmath42 note the value of the function @xmath9 at the axis prescribe the angular momentum of the configuration .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations of the functional @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 in these equations @xmath45 denotes the flat laplacian in @xmath13 .",
    "an important property of the functional is that equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) correspond to the stationary axially symmetric einstein equations .",
    "we are now in position to formulate the variational approach of the inequality .",
    "the conjecture is the following :    [ c:1 ] for arbitrary functions @xmath46 we have @xmath47 where @xmath4 is given by ( [ eq:54 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the equality in implies that the functions @xmath48 correspond to the extreme kerr solution .",
    "that is , for fixed total angular momentum @xmath4 , the extreme kerr solution is the unique absolute minimum of @xmath43 .",
    "the inequality is a direct consequence of this conjecture and .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the number of end points @xmath21 and their corresponding angular momentum @xmath40 are not fixed .",
    "that is , the conjecture states that for fixed @xmath4 , extreme kerr is the unique absolute minimum among all possible functions @xmath46 and among all possible configurations of ends @xmath21 with individual angular momentum @xmath40 .",
    "note that in order to have a non zero @xmath4 we need at least one end point .",
    "this is a singular variational problem since a non zero @xmath4 implies ( by equation ) that at least one @xmath40 is non zero , then equation implies that @xmath9 is discontinuous at @xmath21 and hence has infinity gradient at this point . in order to make the second term in the integral finite",
    "the function @xmath32 should diverge at @xmath21 to compensate the divergence of the gradient of @xmath9 .",
    "also , the singularity of @xmath32 at @xmath21 can not be too severe because the first term in the integral should remain bounded .",
    "in the formulation of the conjecture we did not specify the functional space of admissible functions @xmath46 for the variational problem . as we mentioned above",
    ", the functions are typically singular at @xmath21 , and hence the prescription of the appropriate functional space can be quite subtle .",
    "we will no discuss this issue here since it is beyond the scope of this article . for our present purpose ,",
    "it is enough to assume some space of admissible functions which is regular enough in order that the integral is well defined but it is also compatible with the singular boundary conditions ( [ eq:54 ] ) ( for a discussion regarding this point see @xcite )    conjecture [ c:1 ] was proved for the case @xmath49 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath50 is open .",
    "remarkably , for general @xmath51 in @xcite it has been proved that if the ends @xmath21 and the individual angular momentum @xmath40 are fixed then there exists a unique minimum of the functional @xmath43 .",
    "this minimum satisfies the euler - lagrange equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) .",
    "that is , for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath40 , there exists functions @xmath52 , solutions of ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) , where @xmath53 satisfies ( [ eq:27 ] ) , such that @xmath54 for all admissible functions @xmath46 where @xmath9 satisfies the boundary condition and we have defined @xmath55 what is not known is the value of @xmath56 . in particular , it is not known if this minimum satisfies the inequality ( [ eq : inm ] ) for @xmath50 .",
    "a natural strategy to prove the conjecture is to prove that for arbitrary @xmath21 and @xmath40 the minimum @xmath56 satisfies ( [ eq : inm ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this article is to compute numerically this value for different configurations , showing that it satisfies the inequality in all considered cases .",
    "asymptotic ends[fig:1],width=151 ]    in order to compute @xmath56 we need to calculate the solution @xmath57 of the euler - lagrange equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) with boundary conditions . as an efficient method for computing numerically both the solution and the value of the energy @xmath43",
    "we propose a heat flow defined as follows .",
    "we consider functions @xmath48 which depend on the coordinates @xmath14 and an extra parameter @xmath58 .",
    "then , we define the following flow @xmath59 where a dot denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath58 .",
    "that is , we have added time derivatives to the right hand side of equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) . equations ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) represent the gradient flow of the energy ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "as @xmath60 we expect that the solution of the flow will reach a stationary regime ( i.e. @xmath61 and hence it will provide a solution of equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) .",
    "the important property of the flow is that the energy @xmath43 is monotonic under appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "consider the functional ( [ eq:4 ] ) defined on a bounded domain @xmath62 ( denoted in the following by @xmath63 ) for functions that are solutions of ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) and take a time derivative of @xmath63 .",
    "integrating by parts and using the evolution equations ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the area element of the boundary @xmath66 and @xmath67 denotes exterior normal derivative with respect to @xmath66 . by combining of homogeneous neumann boundary conditions @xmath68 or dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath69 for arbitrary time independent functions @xmath70 ( since in this case we get @xmath71 on the boundary ) will make the boundary term in ( [ eq:10 ] ) vanish .",
    "and hence we get that @xmath72 when the domain @xmath62 is @xmath13 we need to prescribe appropriate fall off conditions in order to cancel the boundary term in ( [ eq:10 ] )",
    ". however , as we will discuss in the next section , in the numerical calculations the domain @xmath62 is always bounded and hence the boundary conditions ( [ eq:42 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) will be used .",
    "the procedure to compute the value of @xmath56 will be the following .",
    "we begin with some arbitrary initial data @xmath73 at @xmath74 that satisfies the boundary condition for some fixed configuration of @xmath21 and @xmath40 .",
    "then we solve numerically the flow equations ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) .",
    "the mass @xmath75 will decrease with time , and it will reach the minimum value as @xmath60 . this minimum will be of course independent of the initial data .",
    "that is , we expect the following behavior of the solution of the flow equations @xmath76 and @xmath77 note that ( [ eq:43 ] ) implies @xmath78 the monotonicity property ( [ eq:43 ] ) , together with the upper bound ( [ eq:15 ] ) , make the flow equations ideally suited for a numerical study of the inequality ( [ eq : inm ] ) .    equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) are essentially harmonic maps with singular boundary conditions .",
    "the first existence result for harmonic maps ( in compact manifolds without boundaries ) used a heat flow @xcite . in that reference the behavior ( [ eq:13 ] ) was in fact proved .",
    "there exists also extensions of this result to include regular boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "these works were the motivation for the flow equations ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize however , that the existence results presented in @xcite @xcite for equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : haf2 ] ) with the singular boundary conditions ( [ eq:27 ] ) ( which are based on @xcite ) do not use a heat flow , they use a direct variational method .",
    "the numerical calculations presented in this article confirm ( [ eq:13 ] ) and hence suggest that a similar existence result can be proved using the present heat flow .",
    "there is some freedom to construct a heat flow out of equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) in such a way that @xmath43 is monotonic under the evolution .",
    "namely we can multiply by arbitrary positive functions the left hand side of ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) and we still have that @xmath79 is negative .",
    "the choice made in ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) appears to be the simplest one because the principal part of the equations are given by heat equations . in effect",
    ", we can write equations ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2 ] ) as follows @xmath80 we also note that in equation ( [ eq : haf1 ] ) we can apply the maximum principle for parabolic equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) to conclude that @xmath81 will be positive for all @xmath58 if the initial data and boundary conditions are positive .    in this article",
    ", the flow ( [ eq : haf1])([eq : haf2b ] ) is used as an auxiliary method for computing a solution of the einstein stationary equations .",
    "it is however interesting to point out the relation of this flow with einstein evolution equations . as we mention above , in axially symmetry einstein equations reduce , in an appropriate gauge , to a system of wave equations for @xmath82 .",
    "more precisely , these equations have the structure of `` waves maps '' ( see , for example , @xcite for the definition of wave maps ) .",
    "the initial conditions for these equations are essentially the value of @xmath82 and the value of the time derivative @xmath83 on a cauchy surface . for a typical collapse",
    "initial data , the system will radiate gravitational waves and reach a final stationary black hole of mass @xmath0 . the initial energy of the system is given by the total mass @xmath3 and it is conserved along the evolution ( see @xcite for a discussion on this issue ) . the total angular momentum @xmath4 is also conserved along the evolution .",
    "we always have @xmath5 .",
    "these data can be also evolved using the heat flow . in this case",
    "the data are only the value of @xmath82 at some time .",
    "the total energy of the system if given by @xmath43 , and we have seen that @xmath84 with equality for momentary stationary data .",
    "the system will dissipate energy and reach a final stationary regime with final energy @xmath56 .",
    "we have that @xmath85 .",
    "for the two cases , the system will reach a solution of the einstein stationary equations at late time .",
    "these solutions are different , and there is a priori no obvious relation between them . in particular , there is no obvious relation between @xmath0 and @xmath56 .",
    "the analogy presented above corresponds essentially to the relation between wave maps , heat flows and harmonic maps which represents a geometric generalization of the relation between wave equation , heat equation and laplace equation . for the case without symmetries",
    "it is not possible to reduce einstein equation to a wave map but the analogy can still be made if we use the ricci flow instead of the heat flow .",
    "note however , that in our case the parabolic equations , although non - linear , are much simpler than the ricci flow equations . for a further discussion about this analogy see @xcite .",
    "the flow equations will provide a numeric solution @xmath73 of equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) .",
    "as we will see below , the functions @xmath82 determine the complete metric of an stationary axially symmetric spacetime .",
    "however , although the solution @xmath82 is always regular outside the ends @xmath21 , it turns out that the other components of the metric are , in general , not regular at the axis .",
    "that is , not all solutions @xmath82 will produce a regular spacetime metric . in particular , it is expected that a solution @xmath82 that correspond to many black holes ( i.e. @xmath50 in our setting ) do not lead to a regular metric . as we mentioned in the introduction , this is a relevant point in the black hole uniqueness theorem .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in the numerical computations presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we emphasize however that in order to test the inequality ( [ eq:14a ] ) we only need to compute the energy @xmath43 which depends only on @xmath82 and not on the other components of the spacetime metric .",
    "in particular , the energy @xmath43 is not affected by the possible singular behavior at the axis of the other components of the metric .    to reconstruct the spacetime metric from @xmath82 we follow @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath82 are solutions of equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) .",
    "then , we can define , up to constants , the following functions @xmath62 and @xmath86 by @xmath87 and @xmath88 the spacetime metric , in coordinates @xmath89 , is given by @xmath90 where @xmath8 is given in terms of @xmath32 by and the functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are defined by @xmath94 all functions depend only on @xmath95 .",
    "the two killing vectors of the metric are given @xmath96 and we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 are spacetime indexes .",
    "we also have that @xmath99 is the twist potential of @xmath100 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the metric will be regular at the axis if the following condition is satisfied @xmath101 for arbitrary solutions @xmath46 this condition will not be satisfied and hence the metric will not define a regular solutions of einstein equations .",
    "the singularities at the axis of these kind of metrics are interpreted as the forces needed to balance the gravitational attraction and keep the bodies in equilibrium ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the regularity condition can be conveniently written in term of a function @xmath102 defined by , we have the relation @xmath103 @xmath104 this function satisfies the following equations @xmath105 condition implies that @xmath106 if the regularity condition fails , we can calculate the value of @xmath102 at each component of the axis @xmath107 these values are calculated integrating the gradients  with an appropriate path , see figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the force between the black holes is given by @xmath108     and @xmath109 .",
    "the dashed line indicates a typical path for the integration of the function @xmath102.[fig:2],width=151 ]    finally , we discuss an important property of the stationary equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) , namely their scale invariance ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath110 be a real number .",
    "given functions @xmath81 and @xmath99 we define the rescaled functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 by @xmath113 the functions @xmath114 define solutions of equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) with respect to the rescaled coordinates @xmath115 . under this scaling ,",
    "the physical parameters rescale as @xmath116 and @xmath117 note that the quotient @xmath118 is scale invariant . in particular , for the case of two black holes , with parameters @xmath119 , @xmath1 and @xmath120 ,",
    "the scale invariance of the solution implies that only two parameters are non - trivial .",
    "we analyze in this section how to solve numerically the flow equations .      although the problem has axial symmetry , equations  are written in @xmath13 ( the laplace operator corresponds to the flat laplacian in @xmath13 ) .",
    "we can solve these equations for arbitrary data , with or without axial symmetry",
    ". the minimum will be axially symmetric for any choice of initial data .",
    "this is of course possible because the boundary conditions ( [ eq:27 ] ) are axially symmetric .",
    "the above considerations suggest that we can solve numerically the flow equations in @xmath13 .",
    "this approach has the advantage that no extra boundary conditions on the axis are needed and also that the equations look more regular in these coordinates .",
    "however , from the numerical point of view , this method has two major disadvantages .",
    "the first one is that there is a significant loss of resolution because a 3-dimensional grid is used instead of 2-dimensional one .",
    "second , the functions are singular at the end points @xmath21 and those points are inside the domain .",
    "that is , there are grid points at both sides of a singularity and this is very problematic for the finite difference method .",
    "we found that it is much more convenient to work in a 2-dimensional grid using cylindrical coordinates and imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the axis , as we describe in the following .",
    "the only disadvantage of this approach is that we need to handle terms which are formally singular at the axis .",
    "a typical example is the term @xmath121 which appears in the cylindrical form of the laplacian in @xmath13 , namely @xmath122 however , following @xcite @xcite , this kind of terms can be handle numerically in a very satisfactory manner as we will describe below .",

    "the domain of interest for our problem is the half plane @xmath124 .",
    "the axis @xmath125 is a boundary of the domain . to simplify the notation and the discussion we will focus on the two black hole problem ( i.e. we will have only two end points @xmath126 and @xmath109 separated by a distance @xmath127 ) .",
    "we emphasize however that the following discussion trivially extends to the general case .    in order to handle the singular behavior of the functions at the points @xmath21 located on the axis",
    ", we decompose the solution as follows .",
    "let @xmath128 be the extreme kerr solution ( see appendix [ sec : extr - kerr - solut ] ) centered at the end @xmath126 with angular momentum @xmath1 . and",

    ", we will work with @xmath130 defined by @xmath131",
    "the idea is that all the singular behavior of the functions are contained in @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we expect the functions @xmath134 to be regular during the evolution .",
    "if we insert the ansatz into the flow equations  and use the fact that each pair @xmath132 and @xmath133 are solutions of the stationary equations ( [ eq : el1])([eq : el2 ] ) , we obtain the following equations for @xmath134 @xmath135 and @xmath136 these are the equations that we actually solve .",
    "let us analyze the boundary conditions for equations ( [ eq : haf1d])([eq : haf2d ] ) .",
    "we begin with the axis .",
    "the boundary conditions for the function @xmath137 at the axis are given by the regularity conditions .",
    "that is , @xmath137 should be a regular function in @xmath13 and hence it should depend smoothly on @xmath138 ( see , for example , @xcite @xcite for a discussion on regularity conditions at the axis for axially symmetric problems ) and then at the axis it must satisfy @xmath139 we use equation as neumann boundary conditions at the axis .    for the function @xmath140",
    "the boundary conditions should be such that they do not change the angular momentum during the evolution . since the angular momentum is prescribed by the value of @xmath9 at the axis ,",
    "the natural choice is that the angular momentum is fixed by the values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 at the axis .",
    "hence the appropriate boundary condition for @xmath140 at the axis is the homogeneous dirichlet one @xmath143    if we consider the whole half plane @xmath124 as domain , then we need to prescribe fall off conditions for @xmath144 and @xmath145 at infinity compatible with the asymptotic flatness of the solutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the solutions and its first derivative should go to zero at infinity .    in our case",
    ", since the grid is always finite , we need to consider a bounded domain",
    ". the domain will be the rectangle @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are arbitrary positive constants ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath150 the part of the boundary that does not contain the axis @xmath125 . we need to prescribe boundary conditions on @xmath150 .",
    "these boundary conditions should have two important properties .",
    "first , they should imply that the energy on the domain is monotonic under the evolution .",
    "second , in the limit @xmath151 they should be compatible with asymptotic flatness . that it , in this limit we want to recover the complete solution on the half plane",
    ".    for @xmath137 we can in principle chose between ( [ eq:42 ] ) or ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "note however that an homogeneous neumann boundary condition for @xmath32 translate into an inhomogeneous neumann boundary condition for @xmath137 ( since they are related by equations ( [ eq:23 ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the simpler choice is the homogeneous dirichlet condition @xmath152 with this choice is also simpler to extend the function to the whole half plane as we will see below .    for @xmath140 we can not prescribe neumann boundary condition on @xmath150 since",
    "if we do so we can not control the value of @xmath140 at the points @xmath153 where @xmath150 touch the axis @xmath125 .",
    "in particular , this will be incompatible with ( [ eq:3b ] ) .",
    "hence , the only possibility is to prescribe an homogeneous dirichlet condition @xmath154 that is , our set of boundary condition for the numerical evolution is given by ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq:3b ] ) , ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:7b ] ) .    the variational problem formulated in section [ sec : vari - probl - parab ]",
    "uses @xmath13 as domain , which is equivalent , by the axial symmetry , to the the half plane @xmath155 .",
    "the fact that in every numerical computation only a finite domain can be used will of course introduce an error . in general it is not easy to measure this error . however , in our case , the variational characterization of @xmath56 implies that an upper bound of this quantity is always obtained even using a finite grid .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "consider the functions @xmath134 obtained in the numerical evolution of the flow equations ( [ eq : haf1d])([eq : haf2d ] ) in the bounded domain @xmath62 .",
    "these functions are , in principle , only defined in @xmath62 .",
    "however , we can extend them to @xmath13 imposing that they vanish outside @xmath62 . and hence",
    ", by ( [ eq:23 ] ) , we get functions @xmath73 defined in @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath156 vanish on @xmath66 ( by the boundary conditions ( [ eq:7])([eq:7b ] ) ) this extension will be continuous but of course , in general , it will not be differentiable at the boundary @xmath66 .",
    "however the extension is weakly differentiable .",
    "moreover the weak derivative is square integrable ( see , for example , @xcite for the definition of weak derivative and also for the proof of this fact ) .",
    "hence , for the extended functions @xmath46 the integral is well defined in @xmath13 and they satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ eq:27 ] ) .",
    "that is , they represent admissible test functions for the variational problem . since @xmath157 is a minimum we have @xmath158 where we emphasize that in this equation @xmath46 are the extended functions .",
    "note that in @xmath159 we have @xmath160 and hence we can decompose the integral @xmath161 as follows @xmath162 the first integral will be the result of the numerical computations using the heat flow .",
    "the second integral depend only on the explicit functions @xmath163 .",
    "we computed this integral using maple 9.5 .",
    "we now describe the way we carry out the numerical computations .",
    "we use a finite difference scheme to solve the initial - boundary - value problem ( ibvp ) given by the equations ( [ eq : haf1d])([eq : haf2d ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ eq:3])([eq:7b ] ) .",
    "we also perform numerical integrations on the computed solutions to evaluate both the mass @xmath164 and the function @xmath165 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) ) used to evaluate the force ( [ eq:30 ] ) .",
    "the ibvp is written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath95 on the domain @xmath166 and @xmath167 given two integers @xmath168 and @xmath169 we define the step - size in the @xmath170 and @xmath22 direction respectively as @xmath171 and @xmath172 our equations have singular coefficients at the points @xmath126 and @xmath109 on the @xmath125 axis .",
    "these point will be placed , in all our runs , at positions @xmath173 @xmath174 the computational grid is defined so that the gridpoint at the site @xmath175 has coordinates @xmath176 in this way the uniform grid is half a step size displaced with respect to the coordinate axes and singular points .",
    "one can think that the domain is broken into @xmath177 cells being each grid point with @xmath178 and @xmath179 placed at the center of a cell .",
    "the gridpoints with @xmath180 and @xmath181 are gridpoints at the center of `` ghost cells '' used to impose boundary conditions at the @xmath182 parts of the boundary .",
    "analogously , the gridpoints with @xmath183 and @xmath184 are gridpoints at the center of `` ghost cells '' used to impose boundary conditions at the @xmath185 parts of the boundary .",
    "the four gridpoints at each corner of the grid are not used .",
    "many of the problems we actually compute are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the @xmath186 plane . in these cases the symmetry is used explicitly to reduce the grid to half - size and so the computer time needed .",
    "the grid covers a domain with @xmath187 ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) .    in our numerical scheme , the four partial derivatives @xmath188",
    "@xmath189 @xmath190 and @xmath191 of @xmath137 and @xmath192 are approximated by the standard fourth - order accurate symmetric difference operators @xcite @xmath193 here @xmath194 and @xmath195 denote , as usual , the forward and backward difference operators , i.e. , if @xmath196 is a grid function on a 1-dimensional grid with step size @xmath197 , we have @xmath198 and @xmath199 to be more explicit we show the approximations to the derivatives with respect to @xmath200 if @xmath201 i.e. , @xmath202 denotes the grid function associated to the smooth function @xmath203 , then @xmath204 @xmath205    to carry out the time evolution we use the du fort - frankel method .",
    "this method is known to be a good choice for solving parabolic problems because it is explicit and nevertheless unconditionally stable @xcite at least when applied for solving an initial value problem . in the notation of @xcite ( or (",
    "7.3 ) ) we set @xmath206 the @xmath86 parameter in this case has to be chosen bigger than @xmath207 for the method to be stable .",
    "the time step can not be chosen big though , and the reason is twofold .",
    "first a big time step gives rise to an increasing parasitic solution @xcite and more important , the boundary conditions also impose stability restrictions . in the way we treat the boundary conditions ( explained below ) we have a scheme that is stable as can be seen explicitly in our runs , but this scheme is probably not unconditionally stable .",
    "experimentally we did some runs with a big time step and could see how the solution diverges in few time steps starting at the boundaries ( around the singular points @xmath126 and @xmath109 ) . in",
    "most of our computations we use @xmath208 and a time - step @xmath209 i.e. the square of the space step - size which is the normal ratio in explicit schemes for parabolic problems .",
    "this time step is however , as the equations have singular coefficients , around ten times bigger than the time step we could use with other explicit schemes like 3rd order runge - kutta .",
    "the du fort - frankel scheme is only second order accurate but this posses no inconvenience since we are looking for the stationary solution of the parabolic problem . in this case , the truncation error due to the time discretization vanishes when the solution approaches the time independent state .",
    "all the boundary conditions we use are either homogeneous dirichlet or homogeneous neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions are imposed to a grid function via the points at the ghost cells ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we show , as example , how this is done for boundary conditions ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:3b ] ) . given the values of @xmath210 and @xmath211 in the interior of the domain , i.e. , for @xmath212 and @xmath181 , the values at the ghost cells with @xmath213 are defined as @xmath214 in this way the boundary conditions ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:3b ] ) are satisfied exactly to the accuracy order of our computations and the same difference operators can be used at all gridpoints inside the domain . as we are using the fourth order accurate operators defined in ( [ eq : op1 ] ) , ( [ eq : op2 ] ) , which have a span of @xmath215 gridpoints , we need two lines of ghost cells outside the domain for each part of the boundary .",
    "we start the time evolution with with initial data that satisfies the right boundary conditions .",
    "now , given the solution at time @xmath58 satisfying the right boundary conditions the right hand side of the equations can be computed in the interior of the domain and the time evolution algorithm computes the values of @xmath144 and @xmath216 in the interior of the domain , at the next time @xmath217 then the solution at this time is extended to the ghost cells so that it obeys the right boundary conditions and the process is iterated .",
    "different criteria can be used to stop the time evolution when one is looking for the stationary state . as the main quantity we want to compute in each run is the mass @xmath164 of the final stationary solution",
    ", we stop the run when the derivative of @xmath164 with respect to time becomes , in absolute value , smaller than a given small value .",
    "to compute the mass @xmath164 and the value of @xmath165 we need to approximate two - dimensional and one - dimensional integrals . as the gridpoints are placed at the center of cells that cover the domain of our ibvp , the simplest appropriate rule to approximate these integrals is the midpoint rule .",
    "the integrand in ( [ eq:4 ] ) , when written in cylindrical coordinates , have singular points at @xmath126 and @xmath218 however the midpoint rule provides good enough results .",
    "for example , as in our runs we used vanishing initial data , i.e. , @xmath219 the integral in ( [ eq:4 ] ) becomes an integral of known , given functions .",
    "thus , we could compare the value obtained with our code to the value obtained with a very precise integration rule  implemented in maple ; in the worst case the relative difference between these values was smaller than @xmath220      all the solutions of the ibvp we computed can be divided into three groups .",
    "the first group consists of symmetric configurations in which @xmath221 is placed at @xmath222 and @xmath223 placed at @xmath224 within this group we carried out runs for different values of @xmath225 and for different domain sizes .",
    "it is clear in this case the solutions @xmath32 and @xmath9 of ( 13)(14 ) are , respectively , symmetric and antisymmetric as functions of @xmath226 moreover @xmath144 and @xmath192 satisfy the same symmetry during the whole time evolution of our ibvp  even on a finite domain  provided the domain itself and the initial data are symmetric .",
    "the obvious initial data satisfying all boundary conditions and symmetry is @xmath227 this is what we used in all our runs .",
    "the second group of solutions we computed correspond to antisymmetric configurations in which we placed @xmath221 at @xmath222 and @xmath228 at @xmath224 we carried out runs for different values of @xmath229 the solutions in this group also have a clear symmetry . in this case both @xmath144 and @xmath192 are symmetric as functions of @xmath226    the third group of solutions we computed correspond to asymmetric configurations in which we placed @xmath230 at @xmath231 and @xmath232 at @xmath233 within this group we carried out runs for various values of @xmath234    when computing solutions in the symmetric or antisymmetric configurations we need to compute the solution in half the domain only , @xmath235 $ ] and @xmath236.$ ] @xmath186 becomes a boundary and all we need is to use extra boundary conditions at @xmath186 that obey the symmetry of the solutions .",
    "this boundary conditions are homogeneous neumann for @xmath144 and homogeneous dirichlet for @xmath192 in the symmetric case , and homogeneous neumann for both functions in the antisymmetric case . by using the symmetry of the solution we reduce to one half the computer time needed .",
    "a main issue , from the point of view of the numerical calculations , is to determine the size of the domain where to compute @xmath237 at the same time we need to estimate error we commit in the determination of @xmath238 we attack these questions mainly by studying the symmetric case .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath239 , for different values of @xmath127 , can be seen in figure [ fig : evolution ] .",
    "the initial data in all the runs was set to zero .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath127 is the bigger the initial @xmath164 is , and also the stronger the equations dissipate so that the code runs for a longer time and the final `` stationary '' @xmath164 turns out to be smaller .      for different values of @xmath127 ( number close to each curve ) . in this plot ,",
