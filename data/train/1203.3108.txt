    "not long after the discovery of pulsars  whose characteristic signal was linked to magnetic fields @xcite  the potential role of magnetic fields in the core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion mechanism began to be investigated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle , a differentially rotating proto - neutron star ( pns ) could both amplify magnetic fields and serve as an energy reservoir available to be tapped by those fields , giving rise to magnetically powered explosions .",
    "an early conclusion , however , was that both unrealistically rapid rotation _ and _ unrealistically strong magnetic fields would be needed at the pre - collapse stage for magnetic fields to play a principal role in the explosion dynamics @xcite .    in more recent years interest in strong magnetic fields has returned in connection with a number of observables related to core - collapse supernovae , including asymmetries in the explosion ejecta @xcite , natal neutron star kick velocities @xcite , and especially the high - energy electromagnetic activity connected to some neutron stars known as magnetars , or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "axps and sgrs are characterized by quiescent x - ray luminosities as high as @xmath1  erg s@xmath2 , with sporadic outbursts releasing up to @xmath3  erg per event .",
    "gamma - ray outbursts from sgrs are even more energetic , an extreme example being the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 , which released an estimated @xmath4  erg over 380  s @xcite .",
    "furthermore , axps and sgrs are neutron stars characterized by relatively long rotation periods ( @xmath5  s ) and high spin - down rates ( @xmath6  ss@xmath2 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as their rotational energy can not account for the electromagnetic emission , and because of the strong magnetic torques implied by high spin - down rates , they are believed to be young neutron stars powered by dissipation of extremely strong surface magnetic fields ( @xmath0-@xmath7  g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the theoretical side , the discovery of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) by @xcite and its application to ccsne ( initiated by * ?",
    "* ) relaxed the requirement of strong pre - collapse @xmath8-fields , renewing interest in magnetic fields as a possible key ingredient in the explosion mechanism of some supernovae ( i.e. , those from rapidly rotating progenitor cores ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( the mri results in exponential growth of the magnetic energy on the rotation timescale . ) however , the rotational energy falls off quadratically with increasing rotation period , and is about @xmath9  erg for a 20  ms period pns  much less than the characteristic ccsn explosion energy of @xmath10 .",
    "thus any magneto - rotationally driven supernovae likely would be peculiar events , since magnetic progenitor cores tend to rotate slowly at the pre - collapse stage @xcite .",
    "leaving aside the explosion mechanism , the relationship between the formation of neutron star magnetic fields and ccsne is still an open and interesting question , particularly in the case of magnetars ( axps and sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that such strong fields must be generated during the neutrino cooling epoch after the collapse of the progenitor s iron core , and possibly before the explosion is initiated ( @xmath11  s after core collapse ) .",
    "their model remains one of the prevailing theories for magnetar formation , and includes a convective @xmath12 dynamo , which operates when the rotation period is comparable to the turnover time of entropy - driven convection ( @xmath13  ms ) near the surface of the pns .",
    "the rapid turnover time may suggest that magnetars are formed in the magnetically - driven explosion of collapsed , rapidly rotating progenitors , whose remnant is spun down by mhd processes at later times .",
    "@xcite found that neutron finger instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may also result in dynamo action in pnss with rotation periods as long as 1  s. in this scenario , the formation of neutron star magnetic fields may be slow ( compared to the explosion time scale ) , and their creation is not necessarily tied to dynamics in the supernova explosion . the mri may also operate near the surface of the pns , and contribute to neutron star magnetization .",
    "the lack of sufficient rotational energy in magnetized pre - collapse progenitor cores , as predicted by stellar evolution models @xcite , has sparked some recent interest in mhd processes in non - rotating ccsn environments @xcite .",
    "these studies investigate field amplification mechanisms and the possible role of amplified @xmath8-fields on the dynamics of slowly or non - rotating collapsed progenitors , in which rotational mhd processes are insignificant .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) studied magnetic field amplification by the stationary accretion shock instability ( sasi , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sasi is central to the theory of ccsne : recent simulations lead to the conclusion that it likely plays an important role in neutrino - powered explosions @xcite , and may also explain certain observables of pulsars , including their proper motion @xcite and spin @xcite .",
    "thus , magnetic fields may be an important part of a supernova model if the sasi is found to be sensitive to their presence .",
    "in we adopted the idealized model of @xcite and @xcite , and added a weak radial ( split monopole ) magnetic field .",
    "we presented results from 2d ( axisymmetric ) and 3d mhd simulations of the sasi , and found that sasi - driven flows may result in significant magnetic field amplification .",
    "magnetic field evolution in axisymmetric simulations was found to be geometrically constrained .",
    "moreover , the non - axisymmetric spiral sasi mode @xcite dominates the post - shock flows in 3d simulations at late times .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the spiral mode drives vigorous turbulence below the shock , which results in exponential amplification of @xmath8-fields due to  stretching \" ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the magnetic energy becomes concentrated in intense , intermittent magnetic flux ropes .",
    "we presented results from models with non - rotating and weakly rotating initial conditions , and weak ( @xmath14  g ) and stronger ( @xmath15  g ) initial magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic fields were not found to reach dynamically significant levels ( i.e. , components of the maxwell stress tensor did not contribute significantly to the total stress ) , and hence no impact of magnetic fields on local or global dynamics was demonstrated .",
    "however , we found that sasi - induced turbulent magnetic field amplification is very sensitive to the spatial resolution adopted in the numerical simulations .",
    "most of the 3d models presented in were performed at  medium \" spatial resolution ( grid cells with sides @xmath16  km ) , while one model was performed with  high \" spatial resolution ( @xmath17  km ) .",
    "the thickness of magnetic flux ropes was found to decrease in proportion to @xmath18 .",
    "we did not observe convergence of @xmath8-field amplification with increasing spatial resolution .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations implied neutron star magnetization as a result of sasi - induced magnetic field amplification .    this paper continues and extends the investigations initiated in .",
    "it improves on our previous study in several important ways , including ( 1 ) coverage of a larger parameter space , ( 2 ) higher spatial resolution ( up to @xmath19 zones ) , and ( 3 ) computation of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra . with the new set of simulations we investigate in some detail the nature of sasi - driven turbulence , and the growth and impact of magnetic fields during operation of the sasi .",
    "we investigate the saturation level of magnetic energy in our simulations , the ( kinetic ) energy reservoir available for magnetic field amplification , and the factors determining the magnetic energy growth rate .",
    "we also consider as in the impact of amplified magnetic fields on global shock dynamics , in particular any impact they may have on the sasi .",
    "finally , we attempt to quantify the levels of neutron star magnetization that may be expected from sasi dynamics .",
    "we find that the sasi - driven turbulence shares several similarities with non - helical turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and results in an efficient small - scale dynamo .",
    "magnetic fields grow exponentially in the turbulent flows driven by the sasi as long as the `` kinematic regime '' remains valid .",
    "the kinematic regime ends when the magnetic energy becomes comparable ( locally ) to the kinetic energy of the turbulent flows  the magnetic energy source . from the computed energy spectra we estimate the  turbulent \" kinetic energy , @xmath20 , available for magnetic field amplification , and , in our idealized model",
    ", @xmath20 constitutes about @xmath21 of the total kinetic energy below the shock ( @xmath22  erg ) .",
    "the total magnetic energy saturates at about @xmath23  erg .",
    "the presence of amplified magnetic fields results in less kinetic energy on small spatial scales , but we find no impact of magnetic fields on global shock dynamics , which is consistent with considerations of the energetics",
    ". however , magnetic field evolution remains sensitive to numerical resolution , and magnetic fields are subject to significant numerical dissipation during the saturated state , and our ability to quantify fully the impact of magnetic fields in a more realistic situation is therefore limited .",
    "the magnetic energy growth time decreases with increasing resolution , and , based on the turnover time of the sasi - driven turbulence , is estimated to be a few milliseconds .",
    "we argue that the mhd processes studied in this paper may contribute significantly to strong , small - scale neutron star magnetic fields , and provide a connection between the magnetic fields of neutron stars at birth and supernova dynamics .",
    "the saturation energies may be sufficient to power flaring activity of axps , and possibly sgrs .",
    "moreover , their formation does not require progenitor rotation .",
    "we employ the same numerical code and three - dimensional initial conditions we used in , which follow closely the adiabatic setup described in @xcite and @xcite : a stationary accretion shock is placed at a radius @xmath24  km , and a highly supersonic flow is nearly free - falling towards the shock for @xmath25 with @xmath26 . between the shock and the pns the flow settles subsonically  obeying the bernoulli equation @xmath27and is nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "matter is allowed to flow through an inner boundary placed at @xmath28  km .",
    "the mass density and pressure just inside @xmath29 are determined from values just outside @xmath29 using power - law extrapolations : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively ( a procedure that proved necessary in order to maintain the steady state of the unperturbed initial condition ) .",
    "figure [ fig : initialcondition ] displays the initial configuration of a spherically symmetric , non - rotating stationary accretion shock with a weak radial magnetic field ( @xmath32  g ; the initial magnetic fields in our simulations are discussed in further detail below ) .",
    "we plot internal energy density @xmath33 , kinetic energy density @xmath34 , magnetic energy density @xmath35 , and the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy density @xmath36 versus radial distance from the center of the star . here",

    "we adopt the ideal gas equation of state , with the ratio of specific heats set to @xmath43 .",
    "the time - independent point - mass gravitational potential is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is newton s constant and @xmath46 is the mass of the central object .",
    "the accretion rate ahead of the shock is @xmath47 , which is held fixed during the simulations .",
    "our numerical simulation code , genasis , solves the adiabatic , non - relativistic , ideal mhd equations including gravity . starting from the semi - analytic initial condition ,",
    "balance equations for mass density @xmath37 , momentum density @xmath48 , and magneto - fluid energy density @xmath49 are evolved with a second - order hll - type ideal mhd scheme in a manner that ensures conservation of mass and energy ( i.e. , volume integrals of @xmath37 and @xmath50 ) to numerical precision .",
    "the magnetic induction equation is evolved in a divergence - free manner via the method of constrained transport @xcite .    without initial perturbations",
    "the initial configuration in figure [ fig : initialcondition ] remains stationary . in order to initiate the sasi we perturb the initial condition by adding small ( @xmath51 ) random perturbations to the initial pressure profile in the region @xmath52",
    "these perturbations initiate the sasi and allow us to study the evolution of magnetic fields in sasi - driven flows .",
    "the topology , strength and distribution of magnetic fields in core - collapse supernova progenitors are highly uncertain .",
    "a similar uncertainty applies to our knowledge of the angular momentum distribution in the progenitor core .",
    "these uncertainties then apply directly to the initial conditions of simulations aimed at studying the evolution and impact of magnetic fields in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "rotation and magnetic fields in stellar interiors are intimately coupled in a complex multidimensional interplay .",
    "stellar core rotation can drive the evolution of magnetic fields , while the magnetic fields can play an important role in distributing the core s angular momentum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "three - dimensional stellar evolution models ( even without magnetic fields ) extending all the way to iron core collapse are currently not available .",
    "however , some insight into the issue of core magnetic fields ( and rotation ) is provided by recent stellar evolution calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite included magnetic fields in their calculations , and found that magnetic torques can significantly reduce the rotation rate of the pre - collapse iron core .",
    "the resulting magnetic fields were dominated by a toroidal component @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the poloidal ( radial ) component of the magnetic field ) .",
    "they also reported that the core rotation rate and magnetic field strength at the pre - supernova stage is an increasing function of progenitor mass . in the iron core of their 15  @xmath56 model ,",
    "the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields are @xmath57  g and @xmath58  g , respectively , while in their 35  @xmath56 model , the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields are @xmath59  g and @xmath60  g , respectively .",
    "accounting for the three orders of magnitude increase attained during core - collapse , the @xcite models predict the post - bounce toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields to be in the range of @xmath61  g and @xmath62  g , respectively .",

    "we only vary the strength of the initial magnetic field @xmath63 at the surface of the pns ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "in particular , we vary @xmath63 in the range from @xmath67  g to @xmath71  g ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : computedmodels ] ) . the initial magnetic energy density profile for the model with @xmath32  g",
    "is represented by the dashed line in figure [ fig : initialcondition ] , where it has been boosted by a factor of @xmath75 to become visible on the plot .",
    "( the corresponding profile for the model with @xmath76  g is identical to the dashed line in figure [ fig : initialcondition ] . ) clearly , when comparing the magnetic energy density to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , all our models are initiated with weak magnetic fields .",
    "from the perspective of the @xcite models , our initial magnetic fields are purely poloidal and stronger than their predicted poloidal fields , but comparable ( in magnitude ) to their predicted toroidal magnetic fields . based on the expected multidimensional character of the post - bounce supernova dynamics ( e.g. , convection and the sasi ) and the strength of the magnetic fields ( @xmath79 is small relative to @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) we do not expect the magnetic fields to retain the anisotropic ( @xmath80 ) configuration predicted by the stellar evolution calculations of @xcite .",
    "progenitors from multidimensional stellar evolution calculations may deviate significantly from their spherically symmetric counterparts @xcite .",
    "we believe the initial magnetic field configuration we have chosen has only ( at best ) a secondary impact on our results , and that initial insight into the mhd evolution in core - collapse supernovae can be obtained from the simulations presented here .    for comparison , the non - rotating simulations recently presented by @xcite with weak initial magnetic fields ( models s15-b10 and s15-b11 in that study ) start with purely poloidal pre - collapse core magnetic fields of @xmath67  g and @xmath81  g , respectively . after core - collapse and shock stagnation , the strength of the magnetic field in the stable layer separating the pns convection zone and the gain region is about @xmath82  g and @xmath83  g , respectively ( cf .",
    "table 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this layer coincides roughly with our inner boundary at @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field strength in their collapsed weak - field models is comparable ( initially ) to that of our strongest - field model .",
    "our rotating models are initiated by setting the pre - shock gas into rotation about the @xmath84-axis by specifying the azimuthal velocity according to @xmath85 , where @xmath64 is the ( constant ) specific angular momentum .",
    "we have computed rotating models where @xmath64 has been set to @xmath68  @xmath65 s@xmath2 and @xmath69  @xmath65 s@xmath2 .",
    "the discretized ideal mhd equations are solved in a cubic computational domain with sides @xmath86 and volume @xmath87 .",
    "cartesian coordinates are employed .",
    "the computational domain is divided into @xmath88 zones in each spatial dimension , resulting in @xmath89 cubic zones with sides @xmath90 . to conserve computational resources we start our simulations in a relatively small computational domain with @xmath91  km and @xmath92 ( resulting in @xmath93  km ) .",
    "the time - step in our simulations ( limited by the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition ) is about 5 - 10  @xmath94s , depending on the stage of the particular run .",
    "the runs are evolved to a physical time of about 1  s , which results in about @xmath95 time - steps taken per simulation .",
    "the mhd solver is parallelized using the message passing interface ( mpi ) , and the computational domain is subdivided into blocks containing an equal number of zones , which are distributed among mpi processes . during the simulations we keep the number of zones per block ( mpi process ) fixed to @xmath96 .",
    "once the sasi evolves into the nonlinear regime the volume encompassed by the shock grows , and the shock eventually interacts with the boundary of the computational domain . when this happens , we expand the computational domain by adding a layer of @xmath96-zones blocks ( i.e. , we add 64 zones in each coordinate direction ) and restart the simulation from the last checkpoint written before the shock interacted with the boundary of the computational domain .",
    "we repeat this process , and run our simulations until the shock interacts with the boundary of the largest computational box @xmath97  km , or the simulation time reaches @xmath98  ms , whichever occurs first .",
    "since we keep @xmath18 fixed during the simulations , the largest computational domain is covered by 1280 zones in each spatial dimension . during a run ,",
    "we write simulation output for analysis and visualization every 2  ms of physical time , resulting in tens of terabytes of data from each model .",
    "we focus on the magnetic field evolution during the nonlinear phase of the sasi , during which magnetic fields are amplified most effectively and the potential for back - reaction of the induced fields on the fluid flow is greatest .",
    "we do not apply any rigorous criterion for the onset of nonlinearity ; we simply note when the accretion shock deviates noticeably from its spherically symmetric initial shape , and the post - shock velocity field has developed a significant non - radial component .",
    "( the upper panels of figure [ fig : machnumberandvorticity ] are representative of the early nonlinear phase . )",
    "our simulations vary in initial magnetic field strength and spatial resolution , and feature both non - rotating and rotating configurations ( see table [ tab : computedmodels ] ) .",
    "we focus first  and predominantly  on non - rotating models , often referring to model @xmath99 ( non - rotating model with @xmath32  g ) as the `` weak - field model , '' and to model @xmath100 ( non - rotating model with @xmath76  g ) as the `` strong - field model . ''",
    "the rotating models are also briefly discussed , but we find that the turbulent magnetic field amplification is mostly unaffected by rotation .",
    "we initiate the sasi with random pressure perturbations in the post - shock flow in order to avoid biased excitation of particular modes ( i.e. `` sloshing '' vs. `` spiral '' ) , and find that all our simulations exhibit flows typical of the spiral mode .",
    "this is consistent with our results in , and with @xcite , who found the spiral mode to dominate the late - time evolution independent of the initial perturbation .",
    "it is also consistent with the conclusions of @xcite , who demonstrated that the spiral modes of the sasi can be viewed as a superposition of sloshing modes out of phase , and that any superposition of sloshing modes with non - zero relative phase leads to spiral modes and angular momentum redistribution in the post - shock flow , which potentially spins up the underlying pns ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the development of spiral sasi modes thus seems to be a general outcome ( in 3d ) of perturbing the ( convectively stable ) spherically symmetric initial condition .",

    "such simulations will improve on our simulations in ( at least ) two important ways :    * a significant amount of magnetic energy ( comparable to that in @xmath140 ) is lost through the boundary at @xmath74 in our models , and not accounted for in the subsequent dynamics .",
    "3d simulations with the pns included do not suffer from this artificial limitation , and will allow us to better assess the role of sasi - induced magnetic fields . *",
    "simulations that include neutrino transport develop neutrino - driven convection , both in the pns and in the shocked mantle .",
    "this convective activity will impact the evolution of magnetic fields , and possibly also the sasi",
    ". we will then be able to study magnetic field evolution in a much more physically realistic supernova environment .",
    "moreover , with neutrino transport included , we will be able to directly address the role of magnetic fields on neutrino - powered explosions .",
    "the constraint on numerical resolution in order to properly describe turbulent flows may still be computationally prohibitive , especially when additional ( necessary ) physics components are added to the models .",
    "this may be partially circumvented with the use of adaptive mesh refinement techniques and improved numerical algorithms .",
    "local ( or semi - global ) simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , adopting physical conditions and forcing functions relevant to the supernova environment ( i.e. , derived from global multi - physics simulations ) , may also be necessary to study turbulent magnetic field evolution and its impact on supernova dynamics in more detail .",
    "more investigations , using both local and global simulations , are needed to better understand the role of magnetic fields in core - collapse supernovae .    in summary",
    ", we conclude from our simulations that magnetic fields in core - collapse supernovae may be amplified exponentially by turbulence on a millisecond timescale ; i.e. , much shorter than the time between core bounce / shock formation and initiation of the explosion .",
    "details of the impact on explosion dynamics by sasi - amplified magnetic fields remain unclear , but on energetic grounds alone the role of these magnetic fields is likely sub - dominant .",
    "the simulations further suggest that small - scale neutron star magnetic fields in the @xmath523  g range may be formed , which may be sufficient to power some of the energetic activity that define axps and sgrs .",

    "the characteristic spatial scale of the magnetic field increases as a result of diffusion ( gray dashed curve ) , which results in a decrease in the decay rate .",
    "the magnetic energy increases with time , and @xmath292 stays roughly constant in the full run ( solid lines ) .",
    "these results confirm our claim in section [ sec : spectralanalysis ] , that numerical diffusion plays an important role in our simulations , and support our claims in section [ sec : magneticenergygrowthrates ] , that our simulations grossly underestimate the magnetic energy growth rate due to turbulence - driven magnetic field amplification in ccsne as a result of the sasi .",

    "the diffusive evolution of intermediate waves by the hll riemann solver motivates us to improve our mhd scheme by including more wave families in the riemann solver in future applications .",
    "in particular , the hlld riemann solver @xcite includes alfvn and entropy modes and is an attractive option ( perhaps in combination with an improved interpolation scheme ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite have developed an hlld - type scheme for relativistic mhd , which shows significantly improved resolution on small scales when compared with the corresponding hll - type scheme ."
