    "it is interesting to compare @xmath223 with the spontaneous emission rate of a different excited state of the two - dimensional electron gas , namely latexmath:[$c^{(j ) \\dagger}_{2 , { { \\bf k}}+ { \\bf q } } c^{(j)}_{1 , { { \\bf k } } }    coherently involve any longer all the electrons in the lower subband , but only the one initially at @xmath83 , so that the corresponding spontaneous emission rate is suppressed by a factor equal to the total number @xmath235 of electrons .",
    "note that an atomic - like spontaneous emission rate@xcite ( i.e. , proportional to @xmath236 and very weak for long wavelength transitions in the far infrared ) is achieved only for a state like @xmath237 ( one electron in the second subband , none in the first one ) .",
    "in contrast , the strong radiative properties of the bright state @xmath238 with spontaneous emission rate @xmath239 occur in presence of a dense electron gas , as considered in this paper .",
    "for a quantum well with very high barriers @xmath230 does not depend on the quantum well thickness ( i.e. on @xmath4 ) and is approximately given by @xmath240 , @xmath241 being the effective electronic mass in the semiconductor  @xcite . using gaas parameters ( @xmath242 , @xmath243 ) , with an electron density @xmath244 and @xmath245 ,",
    "the radiative linewith of the bright state is approximately @xmath246 .    comparing this result with the one ( [ ultrastrongemiss ] ) for the ultra - strong coupling regime ,",
    "the cavity - induced enhancement @xmath247 of the spontaneous emission of the quantum well is given at resonance @xmath248 by @xmath249 for an intersubband transition for which @xmath250 mev , typical values for the non - radiative broadening and the cavity mode broadening are @xmath251 .",
    "the enhancement is then as large as @xmath252 .",
    "the fact that ( [ enhancement ] ) holds only in the strong coupling regime @xmath253 imposes that : @xmath254 which means that the enhancement can not made arbitrary large by simply choosing larger linewidths .    as a final remark ,",
    "note that the expression ( [ enhancement ] ) has been obtained under the resonant condition @xmath255 and is therefore expected to hold in a cone of wavevectors @xmath83 around the resonant wavevector @xmath256 such as @xmath257 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the cavity mode resonance is detuned from the intersubband transition resonance of an amount larger than the linewidths , the enhancement with respect to free space case disappears .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a full quantum theory of cavities in the ultra - strong light - matter coupling regime ( i.e. when the vacuum rabi frequency is comparable to the active electronic transition frequency ) , including the coupling of the cavity system to dissipative baths . in the case of a time - independent cavity properties ,",
    "we have solved exactly the quantum langevin equations for the intracavity operators within an input - output approach and we have determined analytically the output operators , allowing us to determine the response of the cavity system to an arbitrary input .    in the case of a vacuum input for the photonic and electronic polarization fields , we have characterized the properties of the ground state of the cavity system : due to the anti - resonant terms of the light - matter interaction , it turns out to be a two - mode squeezed vacuum , whose properties are weakly renormalized by the interaction with the photonic and electronic baths .",
    "in particular , we have checked that the photons and electronic excitations present in the ground state are purely virtual ones , and can not escape from the cavity : if the input is in the vacuum state , the output is itself in the vacuum state and no radiation is emitted by the system .",
    "furthermore , we have explicitly shown that if no anomalous correlations are present in the input beam , no correlations will be present in the output either , so that no extra - cavity squeezing is observable unless the input is itself squeezed .",
    "on the other hand , the anomalous properties due to the antiresonant terms of the large vacuum rabi coupling show up as a peculiar asymmetric anticrossing of the polariton excitation branches that can be easily observed in the optical reflection , transmission , and absorption spectra under coherent light excitation .",
    "finally , the input - output formalism has been applied to the study of the electroluminescence emission intensity in the case of an electronic excitation : the use of a microcavity surrounding the quantum well provides a significant enhancement of the emission performances as compared to the ones of an isolated quantum well .    as a future perspective",
    ", the theory presented here can be generalized to explore the interesting and fascinating scenario of a time - modulated cavity . even in the case of a vacuum input for the photonic and electronic polarization fields , a non - adiabatic temporal variation of the vacuum rabi frequency ( which is possible in the case of intersubband transitions in doped quantum well@xcite )",
    "is expected to produce an output radiation of correlated photons@xcite , an effect reminiscent of the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "the calculation of the quantum vacuum radiation spectra in the modulated case will be possible using and generalizing the comprehensive formalism developed in this paper .",

    "<S> we present a full quantum theory for the dissipative dynamics of an optical cavity in the ultra - strong light - matter coupling regime , in which the vacuum rabi frequency is a significant fraction of the active electronic transition frequency and the anti - resonant terms of the light - matter coupling play an important role . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> our model can be applied to the case of intersubband transitions in doped semiconductor quantum wells embedded in a microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the intracavity photonic mode and of the electronic polarization to the external , frequency - dependent , dissipation baths is taken into account by means of quantum langevin equations in the input - output formalism . in the case of a time - independent vacuum rabi frequency , </S>",

    "<S> the ground state of the cavity system is a two - mode squeezed vacuum state with a finite population in both photonic and electronic modes . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations are however virtual and can not escape from the cavity : for a vacuum input , a vacuum output is found , without any trace of the intracavity squeezing . for a coherent photonic input the linear optical response spectra ( reflectivity , absorption , transmission ) have been studied , and signatures of the ultra - strong coupling have been identified in the asymmetric and peculiar anticrossing of the polaritonic eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have calculated the electroluminescence spectra in the case of an incoherent electronic input : the emission intensity in the ultra - strong coupling regime results significantly enhanced as compared to the case of an isolated quantum well without a surrounding cavity .    in recent years , the study of cavity quantum electrodynamics@xcite has been a subject of an intense and fruitful research . in particular , a considerable deal of activity has been devoted to the so - called strong light - matter coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is achieved when the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 of an electronic excitation ( i.e. , the rabi frequency associated to electric field vacuum fluctuations ) exceeds the frequency broadening of the photonic and electronic excitations . in the case of atoms in high - finesse cavities ( either in the optical  @xcite or in the microwave  @xcite domains ) </S>",
    "<S> , the strong coupling occurs thanks to the strong spatial localization of the electromagnetic field and the very high quality factors ( as high as @xmath1 ) of the cavity mode and the atomic resonance , but the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 still remains a tiny fraction of the active transition frequency @xmath2 . in the case of semiconductor planar microcavities @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the quality factors are by far less impressive ( typically not much larger than @xmath3 ) , but the strong coupling can be still comfortably obtained thanks to the strong photon confinement and the large electric dipole moment of the active electronic transitions in the quantum well . </S>",

    "<S> the photonic mode is coupled to external world mostly because of the finite reflectivity of the cavity mirrors , while the intersubband transition is coupled to other excitations in the semiconductor material , e.g. acoustic and optical phonons , and free carriers in levels other than the ones involved in the considered transition . in particular </S>",

    "<S> , we have to take into account here all the anti - resonant terms of the vacuum rabi coupling , which forces us for consistency to keep track in an exact way of the frequency dependence of the dissipation baths .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in sec . </S>",
