    "zinc oxide ( zno ) is a wide band gap semiconductor with a direct energy gap of @xmath53.4 ev at room temperature .",
    "this class of material is usually unintentionally ( or , natively ) doped with n - type impurities , such as oxygen vacancies , zn interstitials , and impurity hydrogen atoms .",
    "however , the exact doping behavior of different types of unintentional and intentional ( e.g. , group i or group iii ) dopants is still under much theoretical and experimental debate .",
    "@xcite    zno has recently attracted intense attention owing to its potential prospects in optoelectronic applications .",
    "@xcite compared with the widely studied optical properties , the electrical conduction processes in zno materials ( single crystals , polycrystalline films , etc . )",
    "have not much been investigated over a wide range of temperature .",
    "@xcite physically , the measurements on the temperature dependence of resistivity , @xmath4 , can provide very useful information on the carrier transport mechanisms as well as the associated impurity levels and their distributions in energy in a given semiconducting material .",
    "recently , huang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the electrical conduction processes in a series of oxygen deficient polycrystalline zno films ( @xmath51 @xmath6 m thick ) in the temperature range 2100 k. they observed the three - dimensional mott variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) conduction process below @xmath3100 k. as the temperature further decreased below @xmath325 k , a crossover to the efros - shklovskii vrh conduction process was found .",
    "these two types of vrh conduction processes in zno films have been successfully explained in a coherent manner . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge transport properties above 100 k has not been explicitly addressed in that work , due to the lacking of @xmath4 data above 300 k. in this work , we aim at extending the measurements on @xmath4 to temperatures up to 500 k in order to further unravel the overall electrical conduction mechanisms in zno , especially at @xmath7@xmath8100 k. we have measured an as - grown zno single crystal and remeasured the series of as - grown zno polycrystalline films which were first studied in ref . .",
    "the as - grown single crystal has been _ repeatedly _ thermally cycled _ in vacuum _ and their @xmath4 has been measured during each thermal cycling process .",
    "the polycrystalline films had been deposited in different oxygen atmospheres to contain different amounts of oxygen vacancies so that they possessed differing shallow donor concentrations when as prepared .",
    "our new results are reported below .",
    "we would like to emphasize that all the @xmath0 measurements reported in this study have been carried out in a vacuum ( @xmath9@xmath10 torr ) and in a  dark \" environment without involving any photo - induced carriers .",
    "therefore , complex thermal annealing effects which might result from resistivity measurements performed in , e.g. , an air ( or an active gas ) atmosphere at highly elevated temperatures , @xcite can be safely avoided .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss our experimental method for sample fabrication and resistance measurements .",
    "our results of the temperature dependence of resistance in the wide temperature interval 20500 k and their physical interpretations are presented in sec .",
    "section iv contains our conclusion as well as a summary of the overall electrical conduction mechanisms in the zno materials .",
    "our zno single crystal ( 2.52@xmath111.94@xmath110.45 mm@xmath12 ) were grown by the hydrothermal method and was obtained from a commercial supplier .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , the detailed growth conditions were unavailable",
    ". however , the @xmath4 data do provide us meaningful information on the carrier transport processes in the zno material ( see below ) .",
    "this as - grown crystal has a room temperature resistivity of @xmath55.45@xmath11@xmath13 @xmath14 cm .",
    "our zno polycrystalline films were fabricated by the standard rf sputtering deposition method on glass substrates .",
    "the starting zno target was of 99.99% purity , and the glass substrates were held at 550@xmath15c during the deposition process .",
    "the films were deposited in varying mixtures of argon and oxygen gases .",
    "the @xmath4 of these films had previously been measured and discussed by huang _",
    "@xcite for @xmath7@xmath9100 k.    in this work , four - probe resistance measurements were carried out using a keithley model k-6430 as a current source and a high - impedance ( t@xmath14 ) keithley model k-617 as a voltmeter .",
    "the samples were mounted on the sample holder which was situated inside a stainless vacuum can in a janis ccs350 closed - cycle refrigerator ( 10500 k ) .",
    "the working pressure in the vacuum can was @xmath9@xmath10 torr throughout all resistivity measurement processes , whether the vacuum can was connected to a diffusion pump ( at @xmath7@xmath8250 k ) or not ( at @xmath7@xmath9250 k , see below for further discussion ) .",
    "moreover , the stainless vacuum can contained no optical windows , and thus our measurements were performed in the dark , i.e. , this experiment did not invoke any kind of photo - induced currents .",
    "the four - terminal current leads and voltage leads ( pogo pins ) were attached to the samples with the aid of silver paste .",
    "it should be noted that the resistances reported in this work were all measured by scanning the current - voltage ( @xmath16 ) characteristics at various fixed temperatures between 20 and 500 k. the resistance at a given temperature was determined from the regime around the zero bias voltage , where the @xmath16 curve was linear .",
    "in fact , our @xmath16 curves in every sample were linear over a wide range of bias voltage .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] shows the linear @xmath17-@xmath18 characteristics of the as - grown zno single crystal at four representative temperatures , as indicated in the caption to fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] plots the measured resistivity as a function of reciprocal temperature for the as - grown single crystal between 110 and 500 k. ( the resistance below @xmath3110 k became too large to be accurately measured . )",
    "two distinct slopes are explicitly seen in the two different temperature regimes of @xmath3110220 k ( straight dotted line ) and @xmath3290500 k ( straight dashed line ) , respectively .",
    "such arrhenius - type behavior immediately suggests that the responsible charge transport arises from the thermal activation conduction processes .",
    "indeed , we found that our measured @xmath4 data can be quantitatively described by the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are temperature insensitive resistivity prefactors , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the relevant activation energies associated with the two kinds of thermal activation conduction processes .",
    "@xmath24 is the boltzmann constant . in fig .",
    "1 , the solid curve is a least - square fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq.(1 ) ] ) .",
    "it clearly manifests that eq .",
    "( [ eq.(1 ) ] ) can well describe the experimental result .",
    "our fitted values of @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 are listed in table i. this observation illustrates that there exist in the as - grown single crystal a group of shallow donors with an activation energy of @xmath23@xmath529 mev and a group of intermediately deep donors with an activation energy of @xmath22@xmath5330 mev .",
    "( in this work , we shall maintain the convention @xmath22@xmath25@xmath23 . ) at the sufficiently high measurement temperatures of @xmath7@xmath8290 k , both the shallow and the intermediately deep donors are excited to the conduction band and are responsible for the electrical transport .",
    "however , the exponential temperature dependence of @xmath26 is mainly governed by the number of those intermediately deep donors which are being excited to the conduction band ( the so - called @xmath22-conduction channel ) . as @xmath7 reduces below @xmath3220 k ,",
    "the intermediately deep donors become essentially intact while the shallow donors can still be readily excited to the conduction band .",

    "in this work , we have extended the @xmath4 measurements on these films up to 500 k. notice that these measurements have led to thermal cycling / annealing effect ( in vacuum ) on these films . as a result",
    ", their @xmath4 values are changed from the corresponding values originally reported in ref . .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 values are largely reduced in those films grown under high oxygen atmospheres .",
    "for instance , the @xmath26(300k ) value decreased from 206 to 26 @xmath14 cm in the film no .",
    "7 . nevertheless , we would expect the charge conduction mechanisms , i.e. , the mott and the efros - shklovskii vrh conduction processes previously observed below @xmath390 k as mentioned in the introduction , to be robust .",
    "this assertion is examined in the following .     for four zno polycrystalline films , as indicated .",

    "the symbols are the experimental data and the straight solid lines are the least - squares fits to the eq .",
    "( [ eq.(3 ) ] ) given below .",
    "clearly , in every sample , there exists a linear regime from @xmath380 k down to @xmath325 k. this observation suggests that , in this @xmath7 interval , the dominate electrical conduction process is due to the mott vrh conduction mechanism in three dimensions : @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a temperature insensitive resistivity parameter , and @xmath30=@xmath31 $ ] is a characteristic temperature .",
    "@xmath32 is the electronic density of states at the fermi level , and @xmath33 is the localization length of the relevant electronic wave function .",

    "@xcite our extracted values of @xmath30 , and then calculated values of @xmath32 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are listed in table iii . in order to calculate these three quantities , we have used @xmath33@xmath52 nm , the bohr radius of the shallow donors in zno . @xcite our fitted @xmath38 values are significantly smaller than our film thickness ( @xmath51 @xmath6 m ) .",
    "also , the criterion @xmath40@xmath251 for eq .",
    "( [ eq.(3 ) ] ) to be valid is satisfied in the films nos . 3 and 57 . on the other hand ,",
    "this criterion is not satisfied for the films nos .",
    "2 and 4 , because these two films are not resistive enough to lie sufficiently deep on the insulating side of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite furthermore , our extracted values of @xmath41(40k)@xmath514 mev are somewhat smaller than the corresponding values reported in ref . .",
    "this small decrease in @xmath41 by @xmath335% from that in ref .",
    "can be readily understood as arising from the increased shallow donor concentrations in these films as a result of thermal cycling / annealing .",
    "obviously , on average , a higher donor concentration will lead to a lower thermal activation energy involved in the vrh conduction process .",
    "our observation of the mott vrh conduction in the @xmath7 interval @xmath32080 k in this work demonstrates that this carrier transport process in the zno material is generic and robust , while the values of the relevant parameters may differ somewhat from run to run , because the amounts of donor concentration could have varied . at even lower measurement temperatures ( @xmath920 k ) , a crossover from the mott vrh conduction process to the efros - shklovskii vrh conduction process",
    "@xcite should be expected , as has previously been reported in ref . .",
    "unfortunately , the base temperature of our closed - cycle refrigerator does not allow @xmath4 measurements down to sufficiently low @xmath7 to illustrate this latter vrh conduction mechanism in the present work .      while the shallow donor concentration , @xmath42 , in the zno material is a very important quantity",
    ", it is difficult to measure directly .",
    "however , we may estimate this quantity from the extracted @xmath21 value which characterizes the @xmath23-conduction channel in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.(1 ) ] ) and ( [ eq.(2 ) ] ) . at sufficiently high temperatures",
    "( in practice , above a few hundreds k ) , the shallow donors should have essentially all been ionized .",
    "these excited electrons would move in the conduction band and be in response to an externally applied electric field . the resulted electrical conductivity from this @xmath23-conduction channel",
    "can approximately be expressed by @xmath43=@xmath44=@xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the electron elastic mean free time , @xmath47 is the effective electron mass , and @xmath48 is the electron mobility .",
    "typically , the value of @xmath48 in zno at @xmath7 above a few hundreds k can be extrapolated to a magnitude of @xmath310 @xmath49/vs .",
    "@xcite in the case of our as - grown single crystal , table i lists a value @xmath21@xmath31@xmath11@xmath13 @xmath14 cm .",

    "then , we may estimate @xmath42=@xmath53@xmath3@xmath54 @xmath52 .",
    "these inferred shallow donor concentrations in the single crystal and in the polycrystalline films , respectively , are in good accord with the accepted corresponding values reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite this degree of agreement provides a self - consistency check of our data analyses and the interpretation of the charge transport processes in zno in this section .",
    "we have investigated the electrical conduction properties of zno single crystal and polycrystalline films in the wide temperature range 20500 k. in the case of single crystal , we found that two types of thermal activation conduction processes dominate the carrier transport at @xmath7@xmath8110 k. as a result , a group of shallow donors and a group of intermediately deep donors , together with their individual ionization energies , have been inferred . in particular",
    ", we observed that the shallow donor concentration is markedly affected by thermal cycling in vacuum , strongly suggesting the important role of oxygen vacancies as shallow donors in the zno material . in the case of oxygen deficient polycrystalline films , additional conduction processes due to the nearest - neighbor - hopping conduction and the mott variable - range - hopping conduction mechanisms",
    "are observed .",
    "these two additional conduction possesses originate from the existence of far more numerous amounts of shallow donors ( oxygen vacancies ) in polycrystal films , which led to the formation of a partially filled impurity band . taken together with our previous work ( ref . )",
    ", this present study provides a fairly complete picture of the overall electrical conduction processes in the zno materials .    _ a summary of the overall electrical conduction processes in the zno materials : _ we would like to give a brief summary of the rich electrical conduction processes in the intensively studied , scientifically and technologically alluring zno materials . as the temperature progressively increases from liquid - hilum temperatures up to 500 k , one expects to see , one process by one process , ( 1 ) the efros - shklovskii variable - range hopping conduction , ( 2 ) the mott variable - range hopping conduction , ( 3 ) the nearest - neighbor - hopping conduction , ( 4 ) the thermal activation conduction from the shallow donor levels , and finally ( 5 ) the thermal activation conduction from the intermediately deep donors levels .",
    "the conduction processes ( 1)(3 ) take place in the shallow donor impurity band , while the conduction processes ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) take place in the conduction band .",
    "these conduction mechanisms are generic and robust in unintentionally doped n - type zno materials which lie on the insulating side of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite however , the temperature interval within which each conduction mechanism is found and the extracted value of the associated parameter may vary more or less from experiment to experiment .",
    "such variations can readily arise from the fact that different experiments usually involve differing amounts of donors and differing donor level distributions in the samples .",

    "this can be seen from the fact that , once @xmath7 is sufficiently high and the intermediately deep donors are excited , the @xmath22-conduction channel dominates the sample conductance .",
    "notice that in table  [ table i ] the @xmath20 values are 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding @xmath21 values .",
    "an estimate of the shallow donor concentration is given in subsection iiib.3 .",
    "strictly speaking , the @xmath23 values are sightly reduced from @xmath529 to @xmath52526 mev after repeated thermal cycling .",
    "this can be ascribed to a slight increase in the donor concentration and thus an associated weak dispersion of the shallow impurity levels .                  in case",
