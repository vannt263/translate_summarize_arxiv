    "the properties of galaxies in the local universe appear to depend strongly on their environment .",
    "this issue was highlighted by @xcite with the so - called morphology  density relation .",
    "namely , massive ellipticals and s0 galaxies are preferentially found in crowded regions , such as cluster cores , while spiral and disk galaxies prefer less dense environments .",
    "it is also well established that a rather tight correlation exists between morphological type and level of star formation ( sf ) activity . in general ,",
    "disk galaxies tend to have a higher sf rate ( sfr ) than spheroidal systems .",
    "recently , the nature of this relation has been carefully studied up to @xmath3 by @xcite , through the use of the deep _ herschel _ surveys and well - calibrated complementary sfr indicators on the major blank fields , such as the goods ( great observatories origin deep survey ; @xcite ) and cosmos ( cosmological evolution survey ; @xcite ) fields .",

    "* ) , corresponds to a well defined sequence of disk galaxies , while spheroidal systems tend to live below the ms . in light of this finding , the sfr ",
    "density relation can be seen as an alternative way to study the morphology  density relation .",
    "a galaxy s sfr is on average anti - correlated with the galaxy density in the local universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , highly - star - forming galaxies are mostly found in low - density environments , while the cores of massive clusters are full of massive , early - type galaxies dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "however , the way this relation evolves with redshift is still a matter of debate .",
    "it has been argued that as we approach the epoch at which early - type galaxies form the bulk of their stars at @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sfr ",
    "density should progressively reverse , such that high - density regions host highly star - forming galaxies at earlier cosmic time .",
    "@xcite and @xcite observe this reversal already at @xmath5 in the goods field and the deep2 galaxy redshift survey , respectively . using _",
    "pacs ( photodetecting array camera and spectrometer , @xcite ) data , @xcite detect the reversal only for high - mass galaxies .",
    "according to the authors , this is due to high - mass galaxies being more likely to host active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . since agn exhibit a slightly higher sfr with respect to galaxies of the same stellar mass @xcite ,",
    "agn hosts tend to be star - forming ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "find no reversal in the cosmos field , arguing that the reversal , if any , must occur at @xmath6 .",
    "the aforementioned studies , use different sfr indicators . @xcite and",
    "@xcite convert the [ oii ] emission line flux into a sfr , while @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite use _ spitzer _ mips 24  data to measure the sf activity of their galaxy sample .",
    "in addition , @xcite complement the estimates of sfr derived from the 24  flux with those from ultra - violet ( uv ) emission .",
    "all of these estimators can be heavily affected by dust extinction uncertainties , by agn contamination , and/or by metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these problems can be overcome by measuring the sfr from the far - infrared ( ir ) luminosity , as done in @xcite .",
    "pacs data cover the wavelength range at which the bulk of the uv light is re - emitted by dust , at least up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this enables an accurate estimate of the sfr and avoids possible contamination by agn emission , more common in the mid - ir spectral range @xcite .",
    "also the definition of the environment estimated via the local galaxy density is somewhat arbitrary . indeed ,",
    "several works measure the distance to the nth nearest neighbour ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this method is strongly dependent on n : small values probe high - density regions better though they smooth the low - density ones , while high values of n could wash out the information on over - densities when the number of galaxies in a given halo is less than n @xcite .",
    "other authors measure the density of neighbours within a fixed co - moving volume centred on each galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of these methods rely on the assumption that the local number density of galaxies is a good representation of the environment . however , if the environment is defined as the halo mass of the parent halo to which the galaxy belongs , this is not necessarily the case . indeed , a filament ( interconnecting `` nodes '' of the same large scale structure )",
    ", the outskirts of a massive galaxy cluster , and the core of a galaxy group could exhibit the same galaxy density , even being sites of quite different physical processes ( on multiple scales these environments can be separated , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further complication is added by the interplay of mass and density . according to @xcite , mass and galaxy density",
    "are coupled , with the high - mass galaxies segregated in the densest environments .",
    "this relation was already in place at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evidence for a clear sfr  density trend could be due to a different contribution of massive and less massive galaxies favouring different density regimes .    in order to shed light on the relation between sfr , density , and halo mass , we take advantage of the combination of the deepest available _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ surveys of the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdfs ) and the goods - south and -north fields ( goods - s and goods - n , respectively ) , observed in the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep , @xcite ) and goods-_herschel _ @xcite surveys .",

    "the group sample studied in z13 also includes the x - ray groups identified in the cosmos field by @xcite , and @xcite , and employs the group membership defined by @xcite .",
    "however , given the rather low spectroscopic completeness in the cosmos field ( 40% in the @xmath10 range of interest , see z13 for a complete discussion ) , this region is not included in our current analysis .",
    "indeed , it is not possible to reliably estimate the local galaxy density parameter on the basis of the pure spectroscopic data .",
    "the use of both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , as done in @xcite , is preferable in the cosmos field , where the sampling rate is spatially very inhomogeneous .",
    "thus , since the ecdfs and the goods fields show an extremely high spectroscopic completeness ( 60 - 80% in @xmath10 ) , we prefer to restrict our analysis to these regions .",

    "the dynamical analysis of each structure is based on spectroscopic data . for details on the dynamical analysis and group membership , see @xcite and z13 .    in order to follow the evolution of the relation between sfr and environment , we divide our galaxy sample into four redshift bins , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , according to the redshift distribution of our group sample .",

    "environment relation by distinguishing group members from systems in other environments , we consider , in each redshift bin , all group galaxies together as members of a composite group .",
    "this is done to increase the statistics of group galaxies which otherwise would be too low when considering individual systems .    to limit the selection effects and at the same time to control the different levels of spectroscopic completeness in different redshift bins ( see e.g. fig .  5 in z13",
    ") , we apply a common stellar mass cut at @xmath26 .",
    "this mass cut corresponds to an irac 3.6 @xmath14 m apparent magnitude brighter than the 5@xmath27 detection limit in each considered field up to @xmath28 , enabling a high spectroscopic completeness .",
    "moreover , the considered mass range is still dominated by sources with mips and/or pacs detections , in other words with robust sfr estimates .",
    "the uncertainties due to the spectroscopic incompleteness of our galaxy sample is evaluated with dedicated monte carlo simulations based on the mock catalogues of @xcite drawn from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient for building a reliable density field is very high and spatially uniform spectroscopic coverage .",
    "this is reached in the ecdfs ( see @xcite ) and in the goods fields ( see @xcite ) , for which we reconstruct the density around each galaxy up to @xmath28 .",
    "we use a method similar to @xcite to compute the projected local galaxy density , @xmath29 , around each spectroscopically - confirmed galaxy with @xmath30 .",
    "we count all galaxies located inside a cylinder of radius @xmath31 , within a fixed velocity interval around each galaxy of @xmath32 , about ten times the typical velocity dispersion of galaxy groups ( @xmath33 @xmath34 ) , and above a redshift dependent mass limit ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "given the spectroscopic completeness as a function of @xmath10 in the four redshift bins considered in our analysis ( see z13 ) , we choose as a cut the @xmath10 value where the 40 - 50% completeness limit is reached in each redshift bin : @xmath36 at @xmath37 , @xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 at @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "this does not lead to a different density field definition as a function of redshift bin , but only to a more robust density estimate in the bins where the spectroscopic completeness is still very high at low masses .",
    "indeed , only the absolute value of the density parameter changes , but the relative difference between high and low density regions is kept the same with respect to the choice of a fixed @xmath44 at any redshift .",
    "the density field obtained with the chosen @xmath35 , rather than that at a fixed mass cut of @xmath44 , allows us to distinguish between galaxies residing in dark matter haloes of different masses .",
    "however , the density fields obtained with a lower mass cut show , as expected , higher values and a slightly higher accuracy in distinguishing between galaxies located in parent haloes of different masses .",
    "we estimate that , on average , the projected density obtained with a mass cut of @xmath36 at @xmath37 is a factor of 7 higher than that at @xmath42 . at @xmath39 ,",
    "a mass cut of @xmath38 leads to a density a factor of 5 higher than the cut at lower @xmath10 , while at @xmath45 the density with a mass cut of @xmath40 is a factor of 2.5 higher .",
    "these calibrations are discussed in depth in a dedicated forthcoming paper ( popesso et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "a more physical definition of the density field would require a mass cut which takes into account the evolution of the characteristic magnitude of the stellar mass function .",
    "in our case this would translate to selecting only galaxies at masses larger than @xmath46 at any redshift @xcite , given the restriction imposed by the completeness level of the galaxy sample in the higher redshift bins .",
    "this would imply that at lower redshifts we would select only galaxies with @xmath47 , limiting in a significant way the statistics for defining the density field .",
    "thus , distinguishing between galaxies residing in parent haloes of different masses would be inefficient .",
    "a simple exercise on the mock catalogues of @xcite reveals that this density definition would be able to distinguish only isolated galaxies from galaxies in the core of massive clusters and it would provide the same density for galaxies in haloes with masses ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .    in order to consider the effect of spectroscopic incompleteness , we correct the density @xmath29 by accounting for the possibly missing galaxies .",
    "we consider , for each galaxy , the cylinder along the line of sight , with radius of 0.75  mpc at the redshift of the considered source , and with redshift limits @xmath50 and @xmath51 equal to the limits of the redshift bin to which the source belongs .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness is given by the number of sources with spectroscopic redshifts divided by the total number of galaxies , considering only sources with @xmath52 .",
    "since the redshift bins are more than 10 times larger than the error on the photometric redshift , this uncertainty is only marginally affecting our completeness estimate .",
    "we correct for incompleteness by dividing @xmath29 by this ratio .        in order to test the reliability of our density estimate , we measure , with the same method , the density field in 100 randomly - extracted catalogues from the mock catalogues of @xcite .",
    "we compare the density obtained in this way with that measured in the parent light - cone mock catalogues , free of selection biases . in order to simulate the photometric redshift uncertainty , before estimating the incompleteness correction",
    ", we assign a random error in the range @xmath53 to the redshift of the parent mock catalogue galaxies , where @xmath54 is the photometric redshift error provided in the photometric catalogues .",
    "we find a very good agreement between the original density estimated in the @xcite mock catalogues and the local density retrieved with our method ( fig .  [ comp ] ) .",

    "our density definition takes advantage of the high level of mass segregation observed in the local universe @xcite and at least up to @xmath1 .",

    "in addition , a careful analysis of the biases due to the spectroscopic selection leads to the conclusion that we can also not exclude an anti - correlation at @xmath142 . the observed sfr",
    " density anti - correlation at @xmath93 is not simply ascribable to mass segregation ( most massive galaxies are generally passive galaxies , low - mass galaxies are , on average , star - forming ) .",
    "indeed , we observe only a mild mass segregation in any redshift bin .",
    "our results seem to be at odds with @xcite who find strong mass segregation at least in the local universe . at higher",
    "redshift the effect has never been thoroughly analysed , except for the results of @xcite and @xcite who showed that already at @xmath8 mass and galaxy density are coupled with the most massive galaxies segregated in the most dense environment .",
    "we must note that our stellar mass cut ( @xmath143 ) is rather high .",
    "indeed , a lower mass cut ( @xmath144 ) in the lowest redshift bin leads to a stronger mass segregation , although of small amplitude .",
    "this would be in agreement with the recent finding of @xcite , who observe mass segregation within 10   for groups , by only considering low - mass galaxies .",
    "given the flattening of the sfr ",
    "density relation observed after excluding group galaxies from the sample , we conclude that group members are mostly responsible for the observed anti - correlation at @xmath93 .",
    "thus , galaxies living in relatively massive dark matter haloes must have a suppressed mean sfr with respect to the field , at least up to @xmath137 .",
    "this is confirmed by the sfr ",
    "density relation analysed with our `` dynamical '' approach .",
    "one of the most striking findings in our analysis is the lack of reversal of the sfr ",
    "density relation at @xmath1 .",
    "this result is at odds with recent findings .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite observe the reversal of the sfr ",
    "density relation at @xmath5 in the goods and the deep2 fields , respectively , using a spectroscopically defined density parameter .",
    "we have extensively compared our analysis with that of @xcite and @xcite , since our dataset includes the sky regions analysed in their dataset ( fig .",
    "[ sfr_density_z1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have considered the possibility that the fraction of agn could affect the sfr estimate .",
    "in fact , since the fraction of agn is found to be higher in groups as the redshift increases @xcite and the sfr of agn host galaxies could be enhanced with respect to non active galaxies of similar stellar mass @xcite , we use pacs data to measure , without biases , their sfr @xcite .",
    "this can not be done using mips data or the [ oii ] doublet . removing the agn from our sample",
    "does not affect the significance of the sfr  density relation .",
    "this could be due to cosmic variance , since the fraction of agn present in the goods - s field is higher ( 17% in the highly star - forming galaxies , @xcite ) with respect to ecdfs and goods - n ( 3 - 5% ) .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the density definition itself could be responsible for the differences we observe .",
    "in fact , as explained in section  [ sec : galaxy_density ] , our density estimate is based on a stellar mass cut .",
    "@xcite show that the density definition adopted by @xcite , based on a galaxy apparent magnitude cut ( @xmath83 mag ) , could lead to a strong redshift bias .",
    "thus , we conclude that the previously observed reversal of the sfr  density relations is most likely due to the combination of different effects : the galaxy sample selection , high fraction of agn and a possibly biased definition of the density parameter , which can hide a redshift dependence .",
    "our results are , instead , in agreement with @xcite , who find no dependence of the sfr and lirg fraction on environment , arguing that the reversal , if any , must occur at @xmath2 .",
    "according to @xcite the reversal found by @xcite and @xcite might be due to the contribution of galaxies at lower stellar mass and sfr comprised in @xcite and @xcite galaxy sample .",
    "however , since we consider a wide range of sfr and @xmath10 , we disagree with this conclusion .",
    "the advantage of the @xcite study is the use of cosmos data , which , due to its wide field , is less affected by cosmic variance ( although @xcite is the least impacted , covering a larger volume spread over 4 distinct fields ) . on the other hand , it must be noted that the authors use sources with both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts to define the density field .",
    "this could dilute any over - density present in the field .",
    "our approach is , therefore , more rigorous in this sense .    in our analysis",
    "we estimated the sfr using both ir data and multi - wavelength sed fitting .",
    "the latter is used for all galaxies undetected in the ir bands , i.e. below the ms .",
    "this sfr estimator gives a larger uncertainty with respect to the ir data , as shown in z13 .",
    "however , in case of an under - estimate of the @xmath145 , i.e. for all galaxies that would be on the ms , we should have an ir detection , thus a more robust sfr estimate . on the other hand , in case @xmath145 over - estimates the real value , the signal could be washed out @xcite .",
    "for example , any anti - correlation at @xmath146 could be hidden by the errors .",
    "in fact , as shown also by @xcite , the uncertainties on the sfr(sed ) increase as a function of redshift .",
    "we discuss our possible biases by using the mock catalogues of @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we measure a @xmath80 higher than the one predicted by the simulations .",
    "this comparison also assures that we are not suffering from any bias in the slope of the sfr  density relation and , thus , that our results are robust .",
    "moreover , we note that in some cases the cosmic variance ( or the big uncertainty in the @xmath145 ) could wash out the signal in the sfr ",
    "density anti - relation in the highest redshift bins .",
    "the use of the standard approach for the study of the sfr  density relation , can be ineffective if the local galaxy density is not directly connected to the sf activity , due either to mass segregation or to sf quenching processes linked to galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "for this reason , we analyse the sfr ",
    "density relation with a novel `` dynamical '' approach .",
    "this technique allows us to separate the contribution to the highest galaxy density bins of groups and `` filament - like '' galaxies .",
    "this is not possible in a more classical `` environmental approach '' ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "our results show that the bulk of the sf is quenched in groups .",
    "this is what drives the trend of the sfr ",
    "density relation .",
    "the `` filament - like '' environment has a slower evolution in sf compared to the groups , thus the density ( galaxy - galaxy interaction ) itself can not be responsible for the bulk of the quenching .",
    "we note that we use a fairly large velocity window to compute densities , much larger than the typical velocity differences at which galaxy - galaxy interactions are effective .",
    "this means that there can be a certain dynamic range in the efficiency of our density estimates . in the x - ray groups , galaxies have typically smaller velocity differences than chance projections , but larger differences than close pairs .",
    "both the latter types contribute to `` filament - like '' environments .",
    "this result is not necessarily inconsistent with z13 . in z13 , we show that the sf activity of galaxies is not affected by the local environment of groups , but here we find that it does depend on the global environment . in other words , the level of sf activity is generally low in groups ( with respect to the other environments ) even if it is independent from the group - centric distance ( and from the density , as discussed in z13 ) . rather than being inconsistent with z13 ,",
    "this strengthens our results .",
    "in fact , we show , once again , that the density is not responsible for the bulk of the quenching ( although we can not exclude that some quenching is happening for galaxy - galaxy interactions ) , but that processes related to a massive dark matter halo are more effective .",
    "the high sfr in the `` filament - like '' galaxies at low redshift , more consistent with the field than with the group @xmath80 , is in agreement with the recent finding of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they show that the filament around the super - cluster a1763 hosts the highest fraction of ir - emitting galaxies .",
    "similarly , the `` filament - like '' region contains the highest total sfr per unit galaxy .",
    "our findings are also consistent with those of @xcite , who have used optical data to discover an enhanced star - forming activity among galaxies associated with filaments in the nearby pisces - cetus super - cluster .      in order to investigate the cause of the strong evolution of sf activity in our sample",
    ", we have studied the position of group , `` filament - like '' and field star - forming galaxies with respect to the ms galaxy population @xcite .",
    "many works focus mainly on the study of the ms in field galaxies .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , this sequence suggests that the same small set of physical processes governs the sf activity in galaxies . thus ,",
    "if galaxy evolution is driven mainly by their @xmath147 , there should be no difference among ms star - forming galaxies , regardless of their environment .",
    "on the other hand , if a galaxy depends on the environment in which it lies , a group member should have a different level of sf with respect to the bulk of star - forming galaxies on the ms .",
    "this last point reflects our main result from the analysis of the @xmath104 relation .",
    "in particular , we have studied , for the first time , the location of galaxies in different environments on the @xmath104 plane .",
    "the evolution of @xmath134 shows that , at least below @xmath59 , the sf activity in group galaxies is quenched with respect to the bulk of star - forming galaxies . at earlier epochs , group , `` filament - like '' , and field galaxies have comparable sf .",
    "interestingly , the density seems to play a role in the distance from the ms , since the filaments represent a somewhat intermediate environment in the evolution of @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we show , with high significance , that the speed of the evolution of sf activity in star - forming galaxies depends , at least since @xmath8 , on the galaxy environment , defined according to our `` dynamical '' approach .",
    "in addition , we find that the fraction of qg , @xmath106 , evolves faster in groups with respect to both filaments and field .",
    "the latter two environments show a similar evolution of @xmath106 .",
    "this confirms that quenching processes related to a rather massive dark matter halo ( @xmath148 ) are more efficient than those associated with a generally dense region .",
    "thus , strangulation @xcite , ram pressure stripping @xcite and harassment @xcite , are likely to be much more effective than the simple galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "our result is in contrast with the analysis of @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that central star - forming galaxies are equivalent to field galaxies .",
    "they claim that there is no difference in the main sequence relation of central and satellite galaxies .",
    "however , it is not clear how they discern between star - forming and passive galaxies .",
    "in fact , over their whole study , @xcite use the red / blue galaxy dichotomy to distinguish between passive / star - forming galaxies respectively . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "about 30% of the sdss red sequence galaxies , identified in the colour - magnitude diagram , lie on the ms , which is also populated by green valley galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirm this point , finding two different ms for blue and star - forming galaxies .",
    "this implies that selecting blue galaxies misses many red , dusty , star - forming sources .",
    "moreover , @xcite use the catalogue of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on a friends - of - friends algorithm ) to explore the properties of group galaxies .",
    "as we already mentioned , optical selection of group is much more prone to projection effects than x - ray selection .",
    "in fact , the optically selected group catalogues do not contain virialized , relatively high - mass , x - ray emitting groups and include many more low - mass and unvirialized groups , as well as some pure projections . finally ,",
    "( part of ) optically selected groups could be classified as `` filament - like '' galaxies , implying an @xmath106 evolution similar to that of field galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite , computing the sfr from uv emission for nearby group galaxies , found a ms broadly consistent but flatter than the ms of field galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "they argue that a flattening could be expected if the sfr of low - mass galaxies is suppressed in groups . at a median mass of @xmath149 ,",
    "their ms predicts a mean ssfr which is @xmath150 lower than that expected for the field .",
    "this could be consistent with our results , although we do not cover the same mass range .",
    "our findings support the pre - processing scenario ( galaxies age in groups before entering clusters ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite , who find a strong suppression of sf activity in a sample of @xmath151 groups .",
    "they estimate a stronger quenching for galaxies with @xmath152 , where the fraction of star - forming galaxies falls down to @xmath7412% .",
    "our results are also in agreement with an analogous analysis done by @xcite on the sample of 2df groups .",
    "the authors show that the group star - forming galaxies are located below the field ms , but above the location of the bulk of cluster star - forming galaxies .",
    "this suggests that , although some pre - processing is present in groups , a stronger quenching must happen in more dense and massive systems , like clusters . in this work",
    "we also show that a certain amount of pre - processing happens when galaxies are falling along the filaments , before they enter the group environment .",
    "however , halo - related processes seem to be more effective in quenching the star formation .    the pre - processing scenario is also supported by models .",
    "@xcite , using semi - analytic models , show that the fraction of galaxies that can be pre - processed in a group - size halo of mass @xmath153 is significant ( @xmath154 which raise to @xmath155 for galaxies with @xmath156 ) . furthermore , comparing observations with their theoretical predictions , they argue that satellite galaxies become passive after they have spent 5 - 7 gyr in haloes more massive than @xmath157 . similarly , @xcite , using the stellar masses and merger trees produced by the semi - analytic galaxy catalogues , suggest that all clusters in their sample exhibit a significant fraction of their galaxies accreted through galaxy groups .",
    "for instance , they propose that this fraction is 40@xmath158 for @xmath159 clusters at @xmath160 and only @xmath74 25 @xmath158 at higher redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "our results show qualitative agreement with this prediction .",
    "conversely , @xcite , using cosmological @xmath72cdm n - body simulations , suggest that on average , @xmath7470% of cluster galaxies fall into the cluster potential directly from the field . on the other hand ,",
    "less than @xmath7412% of cluster galaxies are accreted as members of groups with five or more galaxies .    the pre - processing scenario is also reflected in our analysis on the qg fraction in groups , `` filament - like '' environments and field .",
    "our findings suggest that these environments have a different galaxy - type mix up to @xmath1 , with groups being the most efficient at quenching the sf . at higher redshift ,",
    "the galaxy population of groups , filaments and field is similar .",
    "our results find support in several works in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite show that galaxy star - formation and colour transformation rates are higher in the group regions than in lower density areas at @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggest that galaxy colours are particularly affected by the group environment ( with respect to the field ) on short time - scales in a redshift range @xmath161 .",
    "finally , @xcite and @xcite show that the group galaxy population becomes bluer as the redshift increases , but it maintains a systematic difference with respect to the global galaxy population , and an even larger difference with respect to the isolated galaxy population .",
    "in this work we have investigated the sfr  density relation in different environments up to @xmath9 .",
    "we have used multi - wavelength data from the ecdfs and goods fields to study the evolution of sf activity in four redshift bins . moreover , the use of deep mips 24  and _ herschel _ pacs data has assured an accurate estimate of the sfr for all detected ir sources ( in particular ms galaxies ) .",
    "this rich dataset has enabled the use of two different approaches to investigate the evolution of the sfr ",
    "density relation : an `` environmental '' approach , which is the traditional method used in the literature , and a novel `` dynamical '' approach , which splits the sample into group , `` filament - like '' and field galaxies .    by studying the sfr ",
    "density relation in the standard way , we have found an anti - correlation up to @xmath59 but no correlation at higher redshift .",
    "although the significance found by the spearman test decreases as the redshift increases , we did not observe any reversal of the sfr  density relation .",
    "after checking for the presence of biases using the mock catalogues of @xcite , we have verified that we have constantly over - estimated the values of sfr at all redshifts , due to the spectroscopic incompleteness of our catalogues , but that the slope of our sfr  density relation is not affected by any bias .",
    "we have also found that the role of agn is rather marginal in shaping the relation and that the anti - correlation at @xmath93 is dominated by spectroscopic group members .",
    "since our galaxy sample shows only a mild mass segregation at any redshift bin , we conclude that the sfr ",
    "density relation is not driven by a strong mass segregation .    by using the `` dynamical '' definition of environment ,",
    "we have asserted that the bulk of quenching happens in groups .",
    "indeed , group spectroscopic members show a much lower mean sfr than galaxies at similar density but not belonging to bound structures , at least up to @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies in unbound structures exhibit a similar evolution of sfr as field isolated galaxies .",
    "group galaxies only reach the same level of sf activity as field galaxies at @xmath73 .",
    "however , even with this alternative approach , we have not detected any significant sfr  density reversal .",
    "thus , we conclude that group galaxies experience a much faster evolution with respect to galaxies in other environments . in addition , the strong difference in the evolution of the group galaxies with respect to non - group galaxies at similar density ( i.e. `` filament - like '' ) reveals that processes related to the presence of a massive dark matter halo ( ram pressure stripping , strangulation , harassment ) must be dominant in the suppression of the sf activity in group galaxies below @xmath5 . on the other hand , purely density - related processes ( close encounters , tidal tripping ) play a secondary role in the quenching .    in order to understand the cause of the faster evolution in group galaxies",
    ", we have also studied the location of group , `` filament - like '' and field galaxies in the @xmath104 plane .",
    "this has been done to identify if the lower @xmath162 in groups at @xmath163 with respect to field galaxies is due to a general quenching of the sf in all galaxies or to a faster evolution of the galaxy - type mix .",
    "we have found that the ms of group galaxies is offset with respect to that of field galaxies up to @xmath59 , i.e. it is shifted towards lower sfrs . at higher",
    "redshift the star - forming group galaxies are on sequence .",
    "`` filament - like '' galaxies occupy a halfway position between groups and field .",
    "this suggests that both the density- and halo - related processes are playing a role in quenching the sf activity of actively star - forming galaxies , but that density seems to play a secondary role .",
    "interestingly , the qg fraction evolves faster in groups than in the other two environments up to @xmath59 , beyond which the fractions are comparable .",
    "we conclude that the strong evolution observed in the sfr ",
    "density relation , analysed in the dynamical approach , is likely to be the driver of the different galaxy type mix in groups across cosmic epochs .",
