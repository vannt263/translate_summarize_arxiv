    "the physics of convection represents one of the largest sources of uncertainty in modeling stars . in main sequence objects",
    ", convection is believed to occur in the cores of stars more massive than the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in the envelopes of stars having masses less than about @xmath0 .",
    "red giant stars should have fully convective envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making convection common throughout the h - r diagram .",
    "along the white dwarf cooling track we expect white dwarfs with helium spectra ( dbs ) and temperatures less than @xmath135,000  k to have surface convection zones , while those with hydrogen spectra ( das ) and temperatures less than @xmath2  k should also have convective surface layers .    the fact that there are major uncertainties in our ability to model the physics of convection has significant astrophysical consequences .",
    "for instance , whether or not convective overshoot occurs in the cores of massive stars affects the amount of material which is available for nuclear burning , leading to an uncertainty of @xmath3% in stellar ages @xcite .",
    "for pulsating white dwarfs , uncertainty regarding convection in their atmospheres is the largest single source of error in their derived effective temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is significant since we use what we learn about the interior structure of the pulsators to calibrate white dwarf cooling sequences , which in turn can be used to determine the ages of individual white dwarfs @xcite or the age of the galactic disc @xcite .    the very low - amplitude oscillations which have been observed in the sun and recently in other solar - like stars ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) have traditionally been explained through stochastic driving due to the outer convection zones found in these stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , one of the first results from the canadian space mission most ( microvariability and oscillations of stars ) has been that the oscillations expected in the star procyon are not present , at least not at detectable levels @xcite , implying that our understanding of convection in stars even slightly more massive than the sun may still be incomplete .    in the sections which follow we describe a new technique for fitting observed non - sinusoidal light curves in white dwarfs .",
    "with this technique we can recover the thermal response timescale of the convection zone ( or its depth ) and how this timescale changes as a function of effective temperature .",
    "we also obtain mode identifications for the pulsation modes , which helps us to use asteroseismology to study the interior structure of these stars .",
    "our approach for deriving information on the depth of the convection zone and its temperature sensitivity is based on the seminal numerical work of @xcite and on the complementary analytical treatment of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "essentially , we take a hybrid of these two approaches , and it is this model which we describe below .",
    "the fundamental assumptions of our hybrid model are that :    1 .",
    "the flux perturbations beneath the convection zone are sinusoidal in time and have the angular dependence of a spherical harmonic .",
    "the convection zone is so thin that we may locally ignore the angular variation of the nonradial pulsations , i.e. , we treat the pulsations locally as if they were radial .",
    "the convective turnover timescale is so short compared to the pulsation periods that the convection zone can be taken to respond `` instantaneously '' .",
    "4 .   due to the extreme sensitivity of the convection zone to changes in temperature",
    ", we consider only flux and temperature variations , i.e. , the large - scale fluid motions associated with the pulsations are ignored .",
    "the third assumption is given weight by appeal to standard convection models of these stars , which indicate that the time taken for a convective fluid element to circulate from top to bottom of the convection zone should be less than a second .",
    "since the pulsation periods of these stars are much longer than this , i.e. , hundreds of seconds , this appears to be a safe assumption .",
    "while plausibility arguments for the other assumptions may similarly be made , it is perhaps better to see how well they allow us to model the observed light curves before deciding on their viability ( `` the proof is in the pudding '' ) .",
    "we assume energy conservation in that the flux emitted at the photosphere , @xmath4 , is equal to the flux incident at the base of the convection zone , @xmath5 , _ minus _ the energy per unit time which is absorbed by the convection zone , @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 physically , this can be thought of as the convection zone having a specific heat ; it must absorb some amount of energy for its photospheric temperature to be raised by a given amount .",
    "due to the assumption that the convection zone is instantaneously in quasi - static equilibrium , we can compute the term @xmath6 purely in terms of static envelope models having different values of @xmath8 ( see * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "this energy absorption rate depends only on the photospheric flux ( or @xmath8 ) , leading to the following equation : @xmath9 where the new timescale @xmath10 describes the changing heat capacity of the convection zone as a function of the local photospheric flux .",
    "thus , we have reduced the problem to a first - order , ordinary differential equation in time . since the perturbations at the base of the convection zone are assumed to be linear , @xmath5 is taken to have the usual time and angular dependence of a nonradial oscillation mode , i.e. , @xmath11 , \\label{ansatz}\\ ] ] so equation  [ engy ] must be solved on a grid of points across the visible surface of the star having different values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the resulting fluxes need to be added together to calculate the observed light curve ( note : @xmath14 and @xmath15 in equation  [ ansatz ] are the amplitude and phase associated with the pulsation mode , respectively ) . fortunately , because of the simplifications we have introduced , this problem is still computationally tractable .    in figure 1",
    ", we show a theoretical calculation of how this timescale @xmath16 is expected to vary as a function of @xmath8 . for a given value of @xmath17 ( the mixing length to pressure scale height ratio )",
    ", we see that @xmath16 changes by approximately a factor of 1000 as the temperature goes from 12000  k ( the observed onset of pulsations in davs ) to 11000  k ( the observed disappearance of pulsations in davs ) .",
    "if we parameterize this as a power law in @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath18 we find that @xmath19 9095 and @xmath20 is a function of @xmath17 , demonstrating a _ very _ strong temperature dependence ( the curves in fig .",
    "[ tauc ] were computed using the standard mixing length theory of * ? ? ?",
    "we note that although the value of @xmath20 is affected by the version of mixing length theory employed and the choice of @xmath17 , e.g. , @xcite versus @xcite , the value of @xmath21 inferred from these standard models is relatively constant , having values in the range 9095 in the dav instability strip ; for the dbvs , we find @xmath19 2023 . the simplified convection model used by @xcite , while still quite temperature sensitive , has a value of @xmath22 for dav models .",
    "as we will see , the observations can be used to constrain the value of @xmath21 . for comparison with previous work by wu",
    ", we note that in terms of her variables that @xmath23 .",
    "since a typical pulsator may have excursions in temperature of several hundreds of degrees , we expect @xmath16 to vary greatly during the pulsations , leading to nonlinear light curves .",
    "indeed , nonlinearities beyond second order can become important , making it possible to constrain not only @xmath20 but also the other parameters of the fit , such as @xmath21 , the inclination angle @xmath24 , as well as the @xmath25 and @xmath26 values of the pulsation mode .",
    "since the fluxes in equations  ( [ engy0])([ansatz ] ) refer to the total energy being gained and lost by the convection zone , they represent bolometric fluxes . by using sequences of static , numerically computed envelopes to connect conditions at the base of the convection zone with those at the photosphere , we implicitly have taken into account the @xmath27 nonlinearities associated with variations in the photospheric temperature .",
    "however , since the observations that are typically made are in a finite wavelength range which is well - separated from the peak wavelength flux , we must apply a correction factor for the computed fluxes when comparing with the observations .    for data taken with phototubes",
    ", we assume that the observations are taken in a narrow bandpass centered on 4300   , and for ccd data taken with the argos photometer we assume a central wavelength of 5000    @xcite .",
    "the simplified model for the correction factor which we employ here assumes a blackbody distribution for the radiative flux , which we then linearize about the effective temperature ; we apply this correction individually to each element of surface area at each time step . in practice",
    ", this bolometric correction leads to a reduction in the observed pulsation amplitudes of @xmath28 for the davs and @xmath29 for the dbvs .",
    "finally , we note that we have used the same simplified limb - darkening law as wu for both the davs and dbvs , namely the eddington limb - darkening law : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the cosine of the angle between a surface normal vector and the line - of - sight .",
    "in this section we examine how the hybrid model represented by equations ( [ engy])([tpar ] ) compares with the model of @xcite , both for synthetic data and for actual observations of stars .",
    "wu s model uses the harmonics and combination frequencies that arise from the second - order solution of equations ( [ engy])([tpar ] ) . for a single mode with harmonics ,",
    "wu s model constrains @xmath20 , but the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and the amplitude are degenerate with respect to each other .",
    "this is a result of using only the lowest - order nonlinear terms .",
    "our approach is to numerically solve equations ( [ engy])([tpar ] ) , so we implicitly include the contributions of all the nonlinear terms , including those of higher order .",
    "thus , by using more of the information present in the light curves we hope to remove the degeneracies in the fits .",
    "the technique developed by wu was designed to be used for the amplitudes and phases as derived from a fourier transform of the data . for consistency ,",
    "we prefer to make comparisons directly with the light curves , so we use her formulae to generate trial light curves which are then fitted to the data .      in this section",
    "we omit the angular structure and study fits to the emergent flux from a fixed surface element using synthetic data ; this is formally equivalent to examining pulsations having @xmath32 .",
    "in addition to the convective parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we fit the amplitude @xmath14 and phase @xmath15 in equation  [ ansatz ] ; the frequency is assumed known from the observations .",
    "since there is no ambiguity associated with the choice of an inclination angle , we expect that the method of wu , along with our method , will lead to non - degenerate best fit solutions .    in fig .",
    "[ testrad ] we show fits to synthetic ( test ) light curves using ( a ) our hybrid models and ( b ) wu s second - order expression . to compute the synthetic light curve in this test we have assumed that the thermal response timescale of the convection zone , @xmath16 , is given by local mlt models such as the curves shown in fig .",
    "thus , the only difference between the input model and our fits is that our fits assume the simplified form for @xmath16 given by equation  [ tpar ] .",
    "the adequacy of this assumption can be seen in fig .",
    "[ testrad]a which shows that not only is the light curve reproduced well ( lower panel ) but also that the match between the input @xmath16 and that derived from the fit is quite good ( upper panel ) . in fig .",
    "[ testrad]b , we show the same comparisons using wu s second - order expressions for the flux perturbations . in the lower panel",
    "we see that this provides a reasonable qualitative fit to the synthetic light curve , although the marked discrepancies between light curve and the fit arise from neglecting the higher order terms . in the upper panel",

    "for the fits , we have initially varied @xmath24  in 1@xmath39 increments , and in the neighborhood of the minimum we have decreased the increments to 0.1@xmath39 .",

    "thus , elements near the edge of the disc contribute with the same weight ( except for limb - darkening ) .",
    "each of the elements is wedge - shaped and they are arranged radially on annuli centered on the the visible disc of the model .",
    "the input models were calculated using 1024 surface elements arranged on 16 annuli , and the subsequent fits to these models and fits elsewhere in this paper have used 256 elements arranged on 8 annuli .    in wu s second - order theory ,",
    "a degeneracy exists among the parameters such that it is not possible to disentangle @xmath24  from the intrinsic mode amplitude or from the thermal timescale parameter @xmath21 , i.e. , equally good fits are possible for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "our hope is that the inclusion of the higher - order nonlinear effects in our hybrid model will lift this degeneracy and allow unique fits to be made .    in the lower part of table  [ summary ]",
    "we show the results of different fits to a sample light curve having @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath24  @xmath40 ( these values are similar to those derived in section  [ pg1351 ] for pg1351 + 049 ) . based on the residuals , the hybrid model with @xmath41 , @xmath42",
    "can be ruled out , as can be the wu model , although it again provides a reasonable estimate of @xmath20 .",
    "the remaining hybrid models both have very low residuals , making a choice between the two difficult .",
    "but for the best fit solution of figure  [ testtheta ] .",
    "]    in figure  [ testtheta ] we examine the uniqueness of the mode identifications as well as possible degeneracies in the fit parameters . in the upper panel the residuals of the two best fits are plotted as a function of @xmath24 , and in the lower panel contours of constant residuals of these fits are shown as a function of @xmath24  and mode amplitude .",
    "we see that while there is a partial degeneracy between @xmath24  and the amplitude @xmath14 , the presence of the higher - order nonlinearities does indeed lift this degeneracy and allow a unique solution to be obtained .",
    "this best - fit solution is shown in figure  [ testang ] .",
    "although no noise has been added to the synthetic light curve , the derived value of @xmath24 , 54.5@xmath39 , does differ slightly from the input value of 56.0@xmath39 .",
    "this is because for finite amplitude pulsations the parameterization in equation  ( [ tpar ] ) for @xmath16 does not exactly reproduce the variations in @xmath16 of the input model .    from the above fits , we see that a mode with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath43 can be mimicked by a mode with @xmath38 , @xmath37 , and @xmath24@xmath44 ; indeed , even the amplitudes which are derived in these two cases are nearly identical .",

    "the fits we have obtained for the stars pg1351 + 049 and g29 - 38 are quite good , implying that the physical assumptions which have gone into our models are realistic .",
    "although these fits are not necessarily unique , for g29 - 38 we were able to rule out on general theoretical grounds the one competing solution , and for pg1351 + 049 we found that both solutions gave similar values of the parameters ( other than the inclination angle ) . thus , if we view this as a technique to determine the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the mode amplitude then we have been successful .",
    "previous studies using the approach of @xcite to determine the various parameters describing convection and pulsation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have met with less success than our present analysis .",
    "we believe this is for three reasons .",
    "first , by using the higher order nonlinearities we are using more information in the light curve , which lifts some of the degeneracies .",
    "second , the stars we examined had large amplitudes ( i.e. , 510% ) which made the nonlinear effects larger and easier to measure .",
    "third , after being folded the light curves of our objects had very high signal - to - noise .",
    "we note that from the fits to pg1351 + 049 and the test cases examined in section  [ tang ] , this method of mode identification provides better constraints on @xmath26 than on @xmath25 .",
    "this is fortunate , since the complementary technique of chromatic amplitudes @xcite provides constraints only on @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , using these techniques in concert , it should be possible to obtain unique mode identifications .",
    "our results also seem to make sense in terms of simple ( and naive ) theories of convection , as can been seen by the close agreement between the slopes of the dashed and solid curves in the top panels of figures  [ g29fit]a and [ pg1351 ] ; thus , when combined with spectroscopic temperature estimates they can lead to estimates of the mixing length for a given convection model .",
    "in addition , these fits can provide independent constraints on the @xmath25 and @xmath26 values of pulsation modes , something which is necessary for using asteroseismology to study the interiors of these stars .",
    "we consider these results a proof of concept for this method , and they show that pulsating white dwarfs may provide the ideal crucible for tests of theories of convection .",
    "in deriving these fits , we have made no assumptions about either the temperature of the star or the value of any mixing - length parameter which might be used to describe its convection zone .",
    "if we now wish to assume that we know the @xmath8 and @xmath55 values for these stars , for instance , by taking values from the literature , then we can derive further constraints on the value of @xmath17 for a particular mixing length theory .    for the dav g29 - 38 , @xcite derive the values @xmath56  k and @xmath57",
    ". assuming ml2 convection we find that this implies a value of @xmath58 . for the dbv pg1351 + 049 , if we take @xmath59  k and @xmath60 @xcite , then we find a value of @xmath61 . as a point of comparison",
    ", @xcite found , albeit for hotter models , that the peak convective flux in their non - local reynolds stress model could be approximately reproduced for @xmath62 0.60.7 for the da models and @xmath62 0.40.5 for the db models , which is broadly consistent with the above values .",
    "since the value of @xmath17 is a parameterization of the complex problem of turbulent heat transport , there is no reason to suppose a priori that the value of @xmath17 needed to represent the physics in the `` efficient '' regime near the base of the convection zone will also be appropriate for representing the physics in the `` inefficient '' , optically thin region near the photosphere .",
    "thus , the fact that our studies imply @xmath61 for the dbvs is not necessarily at odds with the value of @xmath63 which is assumed in the model atmosphere fits of @xcite . on the other hand , the value @xmath64 which we derive for the davs appears to be consistent with that used for many model atmosphere fits of these stars @xcite .",
    "encouraged by our successes with these two stars , we would like to apply this method to pulsating white dwarfs throughout both the dav and dbv instability strips . thanks to the sloan digital sky survey , the number of known white dwarf pulsators has essentially doubled in the last two years @xcite .",
    "since these pulsators , as well as those previously known , are a population having a range of temperatures and masses , we will be able to map out the depth of their convection zones as a function of both @xmath65 _ and _ @xmath55 .",
    "this should provide us with a detailed map of how convection works in both the dav and dbv instability strips .",
    "given that most pulsating white dwarfs are multi - periodic , this technique needs to be extended to deal with pulsators which have more than one pulsation mode simultaneously present .",
    "this will mean directly fitting observed light curves , as opposed to fitting folded light curves ( pulseshapes ) .",
    "work in this direction is presently underway , and we hope to present such fits in the near future .    in addition , aspects of the approach employed here may also be relevant for other classes of pulsating stars .",
    "for instance , standard models of cepheids and rr  lyrae stars indicate that the convective turnover timescale in their outer zones should be about one - tenth that of their pulsation periods , so the assumptions made in section  [ ass ] concerning the instantaneous response of the convection zone to the pulsations should still be valid , although changes in the radius of the star also need to be taken into account .",
    "in particular , we believe that our approach could possibly provide an alternate explanation for the so - called `` phase lag '' seen in cepheids .",
    "this phase lag is the observed difference in phase between the time of maximum light and that of minimum radius .",
    "the standard explanation due to @xcite assumes that the hydrogen ionization zone is completely radiative , whereas it is very likely strongly convective .",
    "such an investigation could lead , for instance , to independent constraints ( e.g. , mass , depth ) on the hydrogen convection zones in these stars .",
    "finally , the space mission most s _ non - detection _ of solar - like oscillations in the star procyon @xcite calls into question our detailed understanding of convection in stars even slightly different than the sun .",
    "this indicates that the present model of solar convection and pulsation may not scale in the way which is expected when we extrapolate from the solar case , and is just one of many pieces of evidence that we still have a long way to go in understanding the physics of convection in stars .",
