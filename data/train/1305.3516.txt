    "mond @xcite is a theoretical framework positing strong departures from newtonian dynamics and general relativity ( gr ) at low accelerations .",
    "it aims to account for the mass discrepancies in the universe ( including that associated with `` dark energy '' ) without invoking new entities , such as `` dark matter '' ( dm ) .",
    "mond introduces a new constant , @xmath2 , with the dimensions of acceleration , below which dynamics depart from standard dynamics : the lower the acceleration the larger the predicted discrepancy .",
    "reference @xcite is recent review of mond .",
    "mond has been amply tested in disk galaxies of all types , using rotation curves and the mass - rotational - speed relation , over an acceleration range of @xmath12 , as well as in very few elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it has also been tested in diverse pressure - supported , low - acceleration systems , such as dwarf - spheroidal satellites of the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) and of andromeda @xcite , tidal dwarfs @xcite , and small galaxy groups @xcite . in galaxy clusters",
    ", mond does reduce the mass discrepancy from a factor of @xmath13 to a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "this lingering , much reduced , but systematically present discrepancy lends itself to various explanations ( such as being due to yet - undetected baryons , or to neutrinos ) . however , until a concrete explanation is confirmed , this residual discrepancy remains a challenge for mond ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein )",
    ".    some still view mond as a mere `` phenomenological scheme '' that accounts well for observed galaxy dynamics . partly in light of the successes of @xmath15cdm on large scales ,",
    "many hope to see the successful mond predictions on smaller scales explained , one day , within the dm paradigm via some , yet mysterious , connections between baryons and dm .",
    "i quite disagree with these views .",
    "first , mond is backed by full - fledged theories on par with newtonian dynamics in the nonrelativistic ( nr ) regime , and with gr in the relativistic regime , and it is not more of a `` scheme '' and less of a `` theory '' than these are .",
    "second , as has been amply explained , the extent , accuracy , and successes of the mond predictions are serious challenges for the dm paradigm , even more so than its many direct conflicts with observations on small scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "it remains to be seen which of the two paradigms will prevail .",
    "the technique of galaxy - galaxy lensing ( ggl ) uses the statistically averaged , small distortions ( weak lensing ) of background - galaxy images , produced by gravitational lensing due to foreground galaxies ( also averaged over large subsamples ) , to measure the gravitational fields around the latter ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this method of mapping gravitational fields is less accurate than rotation - curve analysis , and is only statistical in nature , dealing , as it does , with average properties of large samples of galaxies , not with individual ones . yet",
    ", it offers important advantages and extends mond testing ( and probing of dm for those who think it is responsible for the mass discrepancies ) in areas not accessible to other methods .",
    "( 1 ) : in individual elliptical galaxies , strong gravitational lensing of quasars can only test mond at small radii where accelerations are of order @xmath2 , and so mond effects are small ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it is hardly possible to test the predictions of mond in the low - acceleration regime  where it matters most  for reasons explained in detail in refs . @xcite .",
    "two rare exceptions are described in ref .",
    "this leaves ggl as the only method to test mond in the very - low - acceleration ( large radius ) regimes of many ellipticals , albeit in a statistical manner .",
    "( 2 ) for disc galaxies , rotation - curve analysis affords the most powerful and accurate tests of mond : it tests predictions of the detailed shape and of the magnitude of the accurately determined rotation curves of _ individual _ galaxies , from the baryon mass distribution alone .",
    "but , rotation curves probe discs only to intermediate radii ",
    "up to tens of @xmath16 in some galaxies  and down to accelerations only as low as @xmath17 .",
    "ggl , while cruder , extends the tests of mond in disc galaxies , to radii several times larger , and accelerations several times lower .",
    "( mond is seen in action at even larger distances , but similar accelerations , in the history of the milky - way - andromeda system @xcite . )",
    "( 3 ) ggl tests mond by a very different technique , using unbound photons as probes , instead of bound massive particles in other techniques , and so extends the compass of mond application and testing .",
    "( 4 ) unlike other methods , ggl involves aspects of relativistic mond .",
    "the recent results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which map the `` dm halos '' of galaxies using ggl , provide a vary useful and ready data set .",
    "in particular , unlike most other analyses , it analyzes the data in terms of `` isothermal sphere halos '' , which lends them to direct comparison with the predictions of mond .",
    "i use these here to test mond in the wide range of galactic radii characterizing the asymptotic , but `` isolated '' regime",
    ".    an earlier mond analysis of ggl is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where some tension between mond predictions and the observations was claimed , in that in the two highest - luminosity bins galaxies required too high baryonic @xmath18 values in mond . however , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , used here , are based on data rather superior to those used in ref .",
    "@xcite , whose analysis was , in addition , beset by other issues , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in section [ predictions",
    "] , i derive the mond predictions and describe their underlying assumptions .",
    "these predictions are compared with the data in section [ analysis ] .",
    "section [ discussion ] is a discussion .",
    "the mond predictions we are testing here concern the light bending effects of a mass ( a galaxy in our case ) in the asymptotic and isolated regime of radii .",
    "the asymptotic regime is defined , in the mond context , by two requirements : ( 1 ) the radii probed are beyond the region containing most of the baryonic mass .",
    "this make the predictions oblivious to details of the mass distribution , which can then be taken as a point mass @xmath0 ; ( 2 ) @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mond radius of the mass ( @xmath21 is used throughout ) .",
    "this ensures that we are deep in the mond regime , where we can make universal predictions that are independent , for example , of the mond interpolating function .    by `` isolated '' we mean that the radii are small enough that the acceleration field is dominated by the central mass , and is not materially affected by the mond external - field effect ( efe ) from external masses , such as neighboring galaxies , clusters , or other large scale structures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we parametrize the external acceleration strength as @xmath22 .",
    "for example , the typical field of the large - scale structure , at a random position , is estimated to have @xmath23 of a few percents .",
    ", which would be reached , at such accelerations , in about half the hubble time . for",
    "a more detailed estimates of @xmath23 see , e.g. , refs",
    "] we are in the isolated regime for radii within r_isol=^-1275 ( ) ^1/2()^-1 , which gives us a large range of radii where all conditions are satisfied . at @xmath24 , the correction due to the efe is of order unity .",
    "for such a regime , all existing nr , modified - gravity mond theories , such as the nonlinear poisson version @xcite , and qumond @xcite , predict a gravitational potential ( r)=(mg)^1/2ln(r ) .    furthermore , the above nr mond theories are the limits of relativistic mond theories  such as teves @xcite , mondified einstein aether theories @xcite , bimond @xcite , and nonlocal versions @xcite . these theories all predict that the above nr mond potential determines gravitational lensing in the same way as the newtonian potential does in gr . in other words , the procedure applied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and other lensing analyses , to deduce the newtonian gravitational potential ( of baryons+dm ) also gives the predicted mond potential , produced by baryons alone .    in the asymptotic regime , the mond potential of eq.([i ] ) strongly dominates the newtonian potential of the baryons .",
    "thus in a newtonian analysis , such as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it would be attributed to a dm halo of accumulated mass within radius @xmath4 m_h(<r)=m=()^1/2r .",
    "this is the mass distribution of a so - called singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , which is one sort of halo that is fitted to the data in ref .",
    "the normalization is parametrized there by a sis velocity dispersion , @xmath25 , such that m_h(<r)=()r . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ ii ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , we see that mond predicts that the @xmath25 value deduced from the lensing data should depend only on @xmath0 via : = ( ) ^1/4 .",
    "note that , in mond , @xmath25used here for ease of comparison with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite  is not the velocity dispersion of any mass component . in particular , it is not to be confused with the baryonic velocity dispersion , @xmath26 , in the galaxy .",
    "it is simply a proxy for the asymptotic ( predicted constant ) rotational velocity around @xmath0 : @xmath27 .",
    "thus the mond predictions tested here are the logarithmic potential , and the @xmath28 relation ( aka , the baryonic tully - fisher relation ) .",
    "relation , which is of a different nature . for this",
    ", mond predicts an approximate correlation @xmath29 .",
    "so @xmath30 is predicted . ]    to be directly comparable with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , this prediction is written in terms of the luminosity : = 166.7   l_11 ^ 1/4 ( ) ^1/472 - 1/2 . here ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 is the baryonic mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath18 ) of the galaxy in solar units , in the same photometric band where @xmath33 is measured , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the hubble constant ) .",
    "i use these normalizations because ref .",
    "@xcite uses everywhere @xmath33 ( in the photometric @xmath7 band ) in units of @xmath37 , and adopt @xmath38 .",
    "relations , eq.([iv ] ) , for baryonic mass - to - light ratios @xmath39 ( lines marked with @xmath40 ) .",
    "the measurements are reproduced from fig .",
    "28 of ref .",
    "@xcite : `` blue '' lenses ( blue squares ) , `` red '' lenses ( red triangles , thick error caps where error bars overlap ) .",
    "the predicted lines for @xmath40 of 1.5 and 6 are practically the same as the best - fit relations found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the `` blue '' and `` red '' lenses , respectively . ]",
    "reference @xcite used imaging data of galaxies from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy wide survey , with good measures of the photometric redshift of the galaxies .",
    "they conducted a ggl analysis of their source galaxies by their lens galaxies , and fitted their signals as being due to three possible types of dm halos .",
    "the type relevant to us here is of the sis halo models . for different lens - luminosity bins , ref .",
    "@xcite fitted for the @xmath25 parameter of the sis .",
    "the relevant lensing signal appears to come from projected radii @xmath41 , which , comparing with the values of @xmath20 , ensures , by and large , that we are in the asymptotic mond regime .",
    "also , only the lensing signal within @xmath42 ( projected on the sky ) was used in the sis fits .",
    "this is done to ensure relative freedom from distortion of the signal by masses other than the galaxy under study ( see detailed discussion of this point in ref .",
    "we see from eq.([x ] ) , which refers to the 3-d radius , that this , by and large , also ensures isolation in the mond sense if the external field is not too high ( as would be the case , e.g. , near a rich galaxy cluster ) .",
    "it does ensure , for example , for most galaxy positions , freedom from the efe by large scale structure .",
    "it also justifies neglecting the efe in groups that are not too compact and rich ; for example for groups containing less than 25 galaxies of the type under study within a radius of @xmath43 , or 100 galaxies within @xmath44 .",
    "reference @xcite does not give enough information to assess the exact importance of the efe , but we see from the above that , statistically , it is not expected to be important .",
    "the analysis is done , and results are shown , separately for the subsample of lenses classified as `` blue''thought to be dominated by late - type , spiral galaxies  and the subsample of `` red '' galaxies  thought to be dominated by early - type , ellipticals . this segregation is particularly important when testing mond : we are not interested in a mere phenomenological dependence of the lensing signal on luminosity ; we need the dependence on the baryonic mass ; so we need to convert luminosities to baryonic masses assuming reasonable mass - to - light ratios .",
    "since galaxies in the two subsamples are known to have different @xmath18 values , such a separation is imperative .",
    "now to the comparison with the mond predictions . reference @xcite makes the general statement : `` the measured gravitational shear signal is isothermal for @xmath45 . ''",
    "this is consistent with the mond prediction regarding the @xmath4 dependence of the lensing signal [ eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) ] .",
    "range used in the fit .",
    "] for each of their bins of luminosity , @xmath33 , in each of the two lens subsamples , the normalization of the sis potential is best fitted for @xmath25 . a plot of @xmath25 vs @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "28 of ref .",
    "@xcite , reproduced here in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "i also show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the @xmath46 relations predicted by mond [ in eq .",
    "( [ iv ] ) ] , for four values of the @xmath7-band @xmath39 .",
    "the `` baryonic '' @xmath18 values , which need to be used , can be larger than stellar @xmath18 values , standardly discussed in the literature , and calculated from population - synthesis models , as they must reckon with the mass in gas as well as that in stars",
    ". the difference may be quite significant in neutral - gas - reach galaxies , which would belong typically , in the low - luminosity , `` blue '' type , where @xmath32 can be several times larger than the stellar value ( see , e.g. , data on this in table 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . and , hot gas in ellipticals also increases @xmath32 over the stellar value .",
    "we see that the data agree with the mond predictions for @xmath47 for the `` blue '' galaxies , and @xmath48 for the `` red '' ones , and that within each group @xmath49 is approximately satisfied with these @xmath18 values .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite gives the best fit @xmath46 power - law correlation : for the `` blue '' galaxies : @xmath50 , and for the `` red '' ones : @xmath51 . both are in very good agreement with the mond prediction @xmath52 , if @xmath40 does not vary much , systematically , within each subsample .",
    "the normalization of these fits are pinned in ref .",
    "@xcite by @xmath53 at @xmath54 : @xmath55 for the `` blue '' , and @xmath56 for the `` red '' subsample .",
    "mond predicts these normalizations for @xmath40 of 1.5 and 5.9 , respectively .",
    "thus , the mond predictions shown for @xmath40 of 1.5 and 6 practically coincide with the best fits of ref .",
    "@xcite , and agree with all the data within the quoted errors .    some systematic variation of @xmath40 with @xmath57 , within each sample ( as well as scatter for a given @xmath57 ) are consistent ( but not required ) by the results of ref .",
    "since , by selection , the higher - redshift lenses tend to be more luminous , luminosity evolution with redshift can contribute to such systematics .",
    "another influence could be the change in relative contribution of the gas to the baryonic mass .",
    "however , it is difficult to pinpoint the exact causes with the scant information we have . in any event",
    ", these @xmath18 variations are very minor compared with the differences between the dynamical @xmath18 values required by newtonian / gr dynamics and by mond , which constitutes our main result here .",
    "the @xmath18 values mond requires are very reasonable baryonic values .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite shows ( in its fig .",
    "4 ) _ stellar _ @xmath58 values for ellipticals , both measured and calculated from population synthesis , which agree well with a range of @xmath48 mond requires here ( they used @xmath59 ) .",
    "another pertinent recent determination of baryonic @xmath58 for the inner parts of compact , early - type galaxies , is ref .",
    "@xcite , who finds ( its fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath60 to correlate with @xmath26 , and vary between @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) ( using @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is quite consistent with what we see in fig .",
    "mond is thus consistent with no mass discrepancy . in comparison ,",
    "the newtonian / gr analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , using halo models of finite mass gives much larger dynamical m / l values .",
    "for example , truncated isothermal spheres of @xmath67 are found to have a joint - sample mean @xmath68 , corresponding to a mass discrepancy @xmath69 .",
    "reference @xcite also gives the best - fitted truncation radius for a truncated - isothermal - sphere halo using the combined `` blue''-``red '' sample , for the reference luminosity @xmath70 : @xmath71 .",
    "taking @xmath72 gives a mond acceleration at this radius of @xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with this truncation being due to the efe of a background field of a few percents of @xmath2 [ see eq.([x ] ) ] .",
    "reference @xcite also show their @xmath46 relations after correcting for some modeled evolution of @xmath33 with redshift .",
    "the changes seem rather small to make a difference in the present context .",
    "the quoted slopes become @xmath74 ( red ) and @xmath75 ( blue ) .",
    "we found that mond s predictions of existing formulations match the ggl measurements and analysis of ref .",
    "these predictions are clear - cut and do not involve details of the theory , such as knowledge the mond interpolating function ( apart from possible influences of the efe , which i estimated not to be important , by and large ) .",
    "while not as accurate and detailed as rotation - curve tests in individual disc galaxies , and while only statistical , this mond test is a major advance : it probes , in _ all _ galaxy types , unprecedentedly large radii and very low accelerations  arguably as low as can be tested without running into the omnipresent efe from large - scale structure .",
    "our results add to all the cases where mond is shown to work well , which teach us , collectively , that baryons alone determine the whole dynamics of galaxies through the simple mond prescription .",
    "this is quite contrary to the expectations in the dm paradigm , where the purported dm halo by far dominates the dynamics over baryons , and where the amount and distribution of baryons in the putative dm halo are determined by haphazard , violent and unpredictable processes ( such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei causing losses of most of the baryons in a galaxy ) .",
    "how can then the puny baryons , constituting only a few percent of the total required dynamical mass , and occupying only a minute fraction of the studied volume , determine all the effects attributed to a much more massive , and much more extended dm halo , through a simple , universal relation ?",
