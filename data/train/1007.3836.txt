    "currently there is great interest in computational models consisting of underlying regular computational environments , and built on them distributed computational structures .",
    "examples of such models are cellular automata , spatial computation and space - time crystallography  @xcite . for any computational model",
    "it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related computational structures . in the finite automata theory",
    "an example of such equivalence is automata homomorphism and , in particular , automata isomorphism . if we continue to stick to the finite automata theory , a fundamental question arise , what a state of a distributed computational structure is .",
    "this work is devoted to particular solution of the issue .",
    "the work consists of the informal presentation in this introduction of an idea that came from the poincar s relativity theory , and an illustration of this idea by a simple computational model with a regular and discrete dynamics that is especially suited for the illustration purpose .",
    "the model with the problem statement is like the model of  @xcite , but in essence differs from it .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of the model is spatial movement of computational structure in the environment . as consequence",
    "we present the number of results on the relationship between computational and dynamic properties of these structures .",
    "so , in this work the collectives of stateless ( i.e. with one state ) automata interacting with an environment defined as a graph are considered .",
    "we study a collective of automata as an integral automata - like dynamic computational object .",
    "the fundamental question what is the state of such dispersed and moving on the environment object and how to measure the amount of state transitions is quite non - trivial . as opposed to the finite state automata where the measure of state transition is one state per unit of time , for a computational dynamic object distributed on the environment certainly different approaches to definition of the measure of state transition are possible .",
    "the idea of our approach came from the special relativity theory .",
    "it is based on the concept of relativity in poincar s interpretation  @xcite . in explanation how to generally understand the relativity poincar begins with an example of resizing of all dimensions in the universe in the same number of times and proceeds with consideration of arbitrary deformations concluding that they should be unnoticed by an observer because observer s standards",
    "are subjected to the same deformations .",
    "this reasoning coupled with the principle that without any changes in the object the process of computation in it is not possible is used in this study to define a state of collective automata .",
    "a `` change '' in an object is a change in the relative position of its `` elementary '' parts per se .",
    "thus , the movement in the environment underlies the process of computation in our model .",
    "let us explain it by an example of a chessboard with pawns .",
    "the chessboard is provided with a natural reference frame .",
    "suppose that we can move any pawn one chess square per unit time in one of four directions : @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 , i.e. pawn s velocity is one chess square in a certain directions per unit time .",
    "let us compose from the pawns a figure , for example , an `` o''-like figure , and look at all these pawns as an integral object .",
    "define the velocity of the object on the chessboard as the average velocity of his pawns .",
    "suppose that the object is moved at maximal velocity `` one chess square per unit time '' in a constant direction .",
    "can the object be transformed simultaneously with the motion from `` o '' to , for example , `` t '' ?",
    "it is obviously that no .",
    "that is , at maximum constant velocity in the example the object can not be changed and , from our point of view , its state is invariable and it performs no computation .",
    "this point of view we have formally illustrated in this work by the simplest example model of stateless automata interacting with one - dimensional environment .    the introduced illustrative model is computational universal , and collectives of automata in the environment can be seen as automata - like computational objects . by analogy with turing machines , which can answer certain questions about properties of words on the tapes , for these objects natural questions",
    "arise what properties of the environment and other objects in it they can identify .",
    "one of the interesting questions is what can an object say about the velocity of its elementary parts ( i.e. stateless automata ) .",
    "can it `` perceive '' any changes in velocity of elementary parts which it consists of ?",
    "this question is similar to the issue in the poincar s story about relativity : can the observer see the deformation of the space , which includes the deformation measurement standards ? having as a goal the answer `` no '' , we define our computational model .",
    "this goal determines the language ( motion velocity , proper time velocity as a measure of state transition , reference frame ) of interaction between collectives of automata .",
    "the concluding comparison of the obtained results with some formulas of special relativity theory shows that the formulated principles are invariant in relation to physical and informational linguistic means of expression . in other words , the semantic affinity of the original principle of motion in our discrete model to the principles of the special relativity theory resulted in the syntactic affinity of their languages ( e.g. , time dilation formula , velocity - addition formula , `` length contraction / extension '' formula ) .",
    "but because of discreteness of our model there are differences . for example , the linear sizes of objects can either decrease or increase in different reference frames . comparing the formulas with the formulas of",
    "the special relativity theory allows also revealing different physical meaning of lorentz factor in the formulas of length contraction and time dilation .    to emphasize a physical analogy in the proposed model and the problem statement we use the short word `` body '' as alias for `` collective of automata '' .",
    "the proposed research is inspired by several research directions which are : 1 ) collective of automata in finite automata theory and complexity of the interactions between them ; 2 ) discrete models of physical processes and projecting of the physical world into informational space of symbols and languages for computer simulation of the physical world ; 3 ) studying the notion of time ; 4 ) spatial computation .",
    "in what follows we use denotations @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the sets of integers and real numbers , respectively . initially in the model defintion",
    "we assume that the domains for the time @xmath6 and space coordinates @xmath7 coincide with @xmath4 but then we will extend them to @xmath5 .    the computational model , that we use for this study , consists of two main components : an underlying environment @xmath8 that is represented by a graph and a set of stateless automata , which are interacting with the environment .    the environment @xmath8 ( see fig.[environ ] ) is defined as the infinite directed graph with the set of nodes @xmath9 and the set of edges @xmath10 .",
    "an edge @xmath11 for some @xmath12 has the absolute coordinate @xmath13 and the direction @xmath14 .",
    "absolute coordinate of an edge @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath16 and its direction by @xmath17 . also the edge @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath18 . by the neighborhood of an edge @xmath19",
    "we understand the pair of edges @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the edges @xmath19 and @xmath20 will be called opposite edges and @xmath19 and @xmath21",

    "we consider only stateless mealy automata .",
    "the set of states of a stateless automaton @xmath28 consists of single state , so there is no sense to mention the transition function and the set of states of a stateless automaton .",
    "thus we write @xmath29 instead of @xmath22 . within the framework of this article for reasons of consistency of latter definitions we name a stateless mealy automaton as an * elementary body * , and we name its unique state as the * internal state*. the elementary bodies will be denoted by lowercase letters , for example , @xmath30 .",
    "we assume also that elementary bodies are coloured in a way that isomorphic automata will have the same colour and non - isomorphic automata will have different colours .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 different numbered from @xmath32 to @xmath31 colours are used .",
    "every moment of time @xmath33 any elementary body @xmath34 is located on an edge @xmath35 of the environment @xmath8 . the input for an elementary body , located on an environment edge @xmath19 , is the sequence @xmath36 called the * neighbourhood state * of the edge @xmath19 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the numbers of elementary bodies of the colour @xmath39 , located on the edges @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the same moment of time , respectively .",
    "the output of an elementary body is one of the two motions either the straight - line motion @xmath40 or the turn @xmath41 .",
    "if the output of an elementary body @xmath34 at a time moment @xmath42 on an edge @xmath43 is the straight - line motion , then at the next time moment @xmath44 and we say that it does not change its * external state*. if the output is the turn then @xmath45 and we say that the elementary body changes its * external state*.    accordint to definition all elementary bodies have the same sets of input and output symbols , so we can write @xmath46 instead of @xmath30 .    denoting by @xmath47 the number of external state changes of @xmath34 until the moment of time @xmath33 we have that @xmath48 and also @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the path covered by @xmath34 during the period of time from @xmath51 to @xmath33 . in other words any elementary body uses the absolute time unit @xmath33 either for one spatial coordinate change @xmath52 in the environment or for one external state transition @xmath53",
    ". schematically , this has the form @xmath54 , illustrated in the left side of figure  [ euclid ] . on the right in figure",
    "[ euclid ] , for comparison , a similar formula @xmath55 is shown that one would expect in a space with euclidean metric .",
    "this formula is using in the special relativity theory for the expression of so - called spacetime interval @xmath56 , which is invariant under lorentz transformations .",

    "we call it uniform spatial velocity if @xmath63 is a constant . for example",
    ", it follows from above definitions that any elementary body can have only one of the following uniform spatial velocities : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "[ euclid ]     vs. @xmath55 ]    an elementary body is unambiguously definable by the set of input symbols that change its external state .",
    "so in the context of our model we can understand under an elementary body @xmath34 the set of signals from @xmath68 that change its external state rather than the triple @xmath46 .",
    "in additional we assume also that elementary body can not change its external state anyway if opposite environment edge is empty , that is , the interaction between elementary bodies occurs only by collisions in the vertices of the environment ( compare with the notion of vacuum state in  @xcite ) .",
    "the elementary bodies can be seen as analogues of signals propagating in the causal network  @xcite .",
    "propagation of signals in  @xcite depends on the functions in the nodes of a causal network , in our model it depends on the output functions @xmath69 of elementary bodies , i.e. , on the properties of `` signal '' .",
    "it should be noted that a set @xmath68 can be infinite .",
    "we have done nothing to circumvent this problem but we can simply assume that the interaction of elementary bodies proceeds so that the set of all possible input symbols can only be finite .",
    "we call the pair of a space coordinate @xmath70 and a time coordinate @xmath33 as coordinate in the absolute reference frame @xmath71 and denote by the column vector .",
    "we call @xmath72 also the event space .",
    "a body is an arbitrary finite set of elementary bodies .    according to the defintion",

    "the following two examples illustrate some of introduced definitions .",

    "we define the body @xmath84 .",

    "since the coordinate values of a body can be non - integers let us extend the absolute reference frame @xmath72 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 and @xmath95 then we say that an elementary body @xmath34 at time @xmath96 has the coordinate @xmath97 and is located on the edge @xmath98 .",
    "the definition implies that the all neighborhood states of the environment edge @xmath99 at time @xmath100 coincide for all @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , the neighborhood state of the environment edge @xmath99 at times @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the same , @xmath42 , and thus , the behavior of elementary bodies is completely determined in the nodes of the environment in which , figuratively speaking , the elementary bodies collide .",
    "we define the world line @xmath105 of an elementary body @xmath34 in time interval from @xmath106 to @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "if the motion of an elementary body in a time interval from @xmath109 to @xmath110 corresponds to a straight world line segment , that is , during this time the elementary body did not change the external state , such a motion is called * elementary motion*.",
    "a body interacting with other bodies exert influence on them and is also under their influence .",
    "it is quite natural to describe such influences on the basis of the notion of a state of a body .",
    "our definition of a state of a body takes into consideration the relative positioning of its elementary parts in the environment .",
    "the changes of relative positioning of elementary parts in a body can affect the body entirely or a particular part of it .",
    "this motivates the question how to measure the amount of state transition . before the definition of the notion of a state we introduce the denotation for the measure @xmath111 of state transition of a body @xmath85 with the flow of time @xmath33 .",
    "a casual meaning of @xmath111 is the `` age '' of the body @xmath85 at the moment @xmath33 .",
    "we call @xmath111 the proper time of @xmath85 .    independently from the definition of @xmath111 , we introduce the velocity @xmath112 of * external state * transition of the body @xmath85 as @xmath113 .",
    "we call this value as the proper time velocity of @xmath85 at the moment of the absolute time @xmath33 .    for any body",
    "@xmath85 @xmath114    for any body @xmath85",
    "@xmath115    from it follows that a body @xmath85 does not change its * external state * if all its elementary bodies do not change their external states .",
    "it means that two bodies are at the same external state in the environment if one of them can be transformed into another by straight - line shifts on the equal number of steps applied to all its elementary parts in direction corresponding their external states .",
    "we have defined what does it mean that two bodies are in the same external state , rather than what the external state of a body in fact is .",
    "if needed the notion of external state can be in generally defined as follows . since the relation `` to be in the same external state '' is an equivalence relation , the external states are equivalence classes of this relation .",
    "the same holds for the latter definition of internal state .    for any body @xmath85 , if @xmath116 then @xmath117 .",
    "the statement follows from the fact that any change of the external state of a body is not possible in case of maximal spatial velocity of all its elementary parts .",
    "the notion of external state of a body allows to start to consider the bodies as an automata - like model of algorithms .",
    "it is natural to ask a functional equivalence of different bodies for example something like automata isomorphism in the finite automata theory .",
    "but since two bodies with different absolute spatial velocities are definitely in different external states we can not compare them functionally .",
    "for example there is no sense to `` ask '' a body to determine its absolute spatial velocity .",
    "however we would like to identify two bodies as the same algorithm even if they move with different spatial velocities .",
    "it will be achieved by introduction of affine isomorphism of bodies through definition of inertial reference frame associated with a body so that the external state of a body will be presented as pair of components : spatial velocity of the body and its spatial velocity invariant internal state .",
    "the point of introducing the notion of inertial reference frame associated with a body lies in the ability to consider other bodies in relation to the given one . with reference frames we attempt to develop a language of interaction between bodies just as the input and output alphabets of finite mealy automata are for the interaction between them .",
    "the language that we develop is one of the possible and thus our approach reflects a poincar s conventional point of view on the physical laws .",
    "an example of inertial reference frame is the absolute reference frame @xmath72 associated with an immovable body @xmath85 such that for all @xmath42 @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and , hence , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the introduced notions of absolute time , absolute coordinate and absolute spatial velocity implicitly mean an absolutely motionless body in relation to which objects were considered .",
    "the reference frames associated with the bodies allow us to make these notions relative .",
    "let us denote ( for a pair of bodies @xmath28 and @xmath85 ) by @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 the coordinate , the spatial velocity , the proper time velocity and the proper time of the body @xmath28 at the moment of time @xmath127 in the reference frame @xmath128 associated with the body @xmath85 , respectively . by definition",

    "a body @xmath85 is called an inertial body if @xmath133 and @xmath112 are both constants .",
    "the property to be inertial implies uniform changes of not only spatial coordinates but also time coordinates .",
    "for the sake of simplicity consider the case only the inertial bodies .",
    "the only restriction imposed on the inertial reference frames is the property that space - time coordinates of same events in different inertial reference frames are connected by affine transformation .",
    "it follows that a body that is inertial in the absolute inertial reference frame is inertial in any other inertial reference frame .",
