    "the outer spiral arm of the milky way ( also called the cygnus arm ) is located beyond the perseus arm and may be the outermost arm of the galaxy s stellar disk ( see fig .",
    "it is traceable across portions of the fourth and first quadrants of the galaxy and it can be detected through the emission of hi and molecular gas ( nakanishi & sofue 2003 ; nakanishi & sofue 2006 ) .",
    "the arm may continue through the second and third quadrants , as shown by spectroscopic and photometric observations of open clusters ( pandey et al .",
    "2006 ) and hii regions ( russeil et al .",
    "2007 ) . indeed , honma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used the vera array and measured the annual parallax and proper motion of h@xmath1o masers in s269 , a star forming region at a galactic longitude of 196@xmath6 .",
    "they found a galactocentric distance of 13.6 kpc ( for r@xmath7=8.5kpc ) , consistent with it being in the outer arm .",
    "the size and structure of our galaxy have been mainly determined by kinematic distances , which involve comparing measured radial velocities with a kinematic model ( e.g. , gmez 2006 )",
    ". however , kinematic distances depend strongly on the galactic rotation model chosen and peculiar motions render them questionable ( e.g. , xu et al .",
    "this is particularly true for the outer galaxy , since the galactic rotation speed is quite uncertain ( e.g. brand & blitz 1993 ) .",
    "recently , distances of galactic maser sources have been directly determined by annual parallax measurements that use phase - referencing vlbi techniques ( e.g. hachisuka et al .",
    "2006 ; xu et al . 2006 ; honma et al .",
    "such parallax measurements can yield distances of many kiloparsecs with errors less than ten percent , allowing _",
    "direct _ distance determinations for objects located near the edge of the stellar disk of our galaxy .",
    "wouterloot et al .",
    "( 1993 ) searched for h@xmath1o maser sources toward iras sources with @xmath8co emission and found several for which their kinematic distances indicated large distances from the galactic center .",
    "most of these maser sources seem to be located in the perseus arm , but several sources have large negative lsr velocities and are probably in the outer arm ( wouterloot et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "one of these sources , wb89@xmath0437 ( iras 02395 + 6244 ) , is located at a galactic longitude of @xmath9 and has a kinematic distance of 8.6 kpc , which would place it beyond the outer arm .",
    "it is one of the most luminous fir source with the strongest h@xmath1o maser emission in the outer part of the galaxy . since radio continuum emission has not been detected , the spectral type of the exciting star is thought to be b1 ( rudolph et al . 1996 ) or later ( brand et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the young stellar object wb89@xmath0437 itself is deeply embedded and , testifying for its youth , drives an outflow traced by high velocity co and h@xmath10o masers .",
    "the latter are found offset by roughly 3 arcseconds from the position of the peak of co and cs emission .    because of its strength and location in the outer part of the galaxy , we selected this maser as the target for an annual parallax measurement . here",
    "we report the results of these measurements , which yielded the distance and proper motion of this star forming region in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "we used the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) to observe wb89@xmath0437 under program bh136 .",
    "the observations involved rapid switching between an extragalactic background continuum radio source and the h@xmath1o maser .",
    "the observations were performed at 5 epochs spread over about 10 months in 2006 ( see table  [ table:1 ] for details ) .",
    "the separations between adjacent epochs were typically 3 months and the observations were performed close to the dates of the maximum and minimum of the annual parallax signature in right ascension and declination .",
    "we limited the observing time span to 10 months , instead of 1 year , to minimize the effects of maser variability .",
    "we observed two 16 mhz wide bands with one band centered on the maser s centroid lsr velocity of @xmath11 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the data were correlated with 1024 spectral channels in each band , resulting in a channel spacing of 0.21 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we used the icrf extragalactic radio source j0244 + 6228 at r.a.=02@xmath1244@xmath1357.696849@xmath20.000168@xmath14 and dec.=+62@xmath628@xmath1506.51470@xmath20.00097@xmath16 ( j2000 ) ( fey et al .",
    "2004 ) as the phase - reference source .",
    "this source had already been used for the parallax observation of the h@xmath1o maser in w3oh ( hachisuka et al .",
    "j0244 + 6228 had no detectable extended structure and its high flux density , near 1  jy at 22 ghz , makes it an excellent source for phase - referencing vlbi .",
    "moreover , its angular separation from wb89@xmath0437 is only 0@xmath17.5 , promising high quality relative astrometry .",
    "we switched between maser and reference source every 30 seconds , yielding @xmath1822 seconds on - source time per scan . at each epoch , we obtained total on - source integration times of @xmath19 minutes for each source .",
    "the total observing time was spread over 6 hours , including the calibrator observations , the slewing time of the telescopes , and observations of a second maser which will be presented elsewhere .    in order to correct for small zenith delay errors in the atmospheric model of the vlba correlator ( see reid & brunthaler 2004 ) , we performed _",
    "geodetic - like _ observations at 22 ghz ( brunthaler et al . 2005 ) at the beginning and end of each vlba observation .",
    "these observations involved 22 icrf sources with positions accurate to better than 1 mas and sampled a wide range of source elevations with a frequency setup involving eight 4mhz bands at left circular polarization that spanned a frequency range of 450mhz . the multi - band delays and rates from a fringe fit to these quasars",
    "were then fit with a model that consisted of a zenith delay offset at all antennas as well as a clock offset at all antennas except the reference antenna .",
    "most of the calibration and data reduction were carried out with standard procedures for spectral - line observations using the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "first , we applied the latest values of the earth s orientation parameters and corrected for effects of the changing feed parallactic angles .",
    "next , we removed atmospheric zenith delay errors , corrected for voltage offset in the samplers , and applied antenna gains and system temperatures for the amplitude calibration .",
    "next , we corrected for electronic delay and phase differences among the if bands using data from nrao150 .",
    "many h@xmath1o maser spots could be imaged after calibration .",
    "we determined their peak positions on images by fitting elliptical gaussian components and traced individual maser spots over the five epochs .",
    "twenty h@xmath1o maser features were detected in the lsr velocity range @xmath20 to @xmath21 km  s@xmath5 , distributed over an area of 0@xmath16.8 @xmath22 1@xmath16.6 ( fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "16 of the 20 h@xmath1o maser features were detected at 2 or more epochs and 4 of them were detected at all 5 epochs .",
    "we used three of the four h@xmath1o maser features that were detected at all five epochs for the parallax fitting .",
    "the last feature was located at a distance of @xmath41.4@xmath16 from the phase center , which is larger than our nominal field of view ( @xmath40.7@xmath16 ) .",
    "hence , it was heavily affected by fringe - rate smearing and was not used for the parallax estimate .",
    "one maser feature was detected in thirty channels , and two features were detected over seven frequency channels .",
    "first , we fitted the parallaxes and proper motions to data from each spectral channel individually .",
    "the residuals to the fits showed reduced @xmath23 values that were relatively large ( @xmath4 28 ) , since the formal position errors from the gaussian fits to the maps underestimate the true position uncertainty . the true position error of a maser spot relative to a background source is usually dominated by systematics , owing to uncalibrated residual atmospheric delays and/or maser spot structural variations .",
    "hence , we added `` error floors '' in quadrature to the formal position uncertainties until we achieved @xmath23 per degree of freedom values of near unity for the data from each coordinate . for this dataset we needed error floors between 10 and 60 @xmath24as for different maser features",
    "the individual parallaxes and proper motions for each feature are shown in table  2 together with their formal errors from the fit .",
    "also given are the average parallaxes and proper motions for each feature together with the standard error of the mean and the standard deviation ( in parentheses ) .",
    "next , we fitted all channels from any given maser feature simultaneously with one parallax but different proper motions and position offsets for each channel .",
    "the resulting parallaxes for each maser feature are also given in table  2 .",
    "all three features have consistent parallaxes of 0.164@xmath20.0014 , 0.163@xmath20.004 mas and 0.164@xmath20.007 mas .",
    "we also performed a combined parallax fit with all channels from the three features .",
    "the resulting parallax is 0.164@xmath20.0016 mas . for this fit we used error floors of 17 and 12 @xmath24as in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "[ parallax ] ( top ) shows the parallax signal for one channel ( i.e. the first channel ) from each feature and the combined fit to all channels .",
    "the individual proper motions and position offsets were removed before plotting .",
    "combining the results of several maser spots can lead to underestimation of the parallax uncertainty , since the measurements may not be statistically independent .",
    "random - like errors ( e.g. from map noise and possibly maser spot structure variations ) will not be correlated among different maser spots . however",
    ", systematic errors ( e.g. caused by residual atmospheric delay errors ) will affect all maser spots in one epoch in a very similar way .",
    "the most conservative approach would be to assume 100% correlation and multiply the formal error by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of individual data sets used in the fit .",
    "this would give an error of @xmath27 mas = 0.011 mas .    to estimate the effect of the systematic errors on our parallax measurement , we examined position residuals after removing the proper motions and position offsets ( e.g. the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ parallax ] , top ) and calculated the average maser position of all channels from all three features in each epoch .",
    "the averaging should reduce the random error , but leave the systematic error unaffected",
    ". a parallax fit to the averaged data points ( fig .",
    "[ parallax ] , bottom ) yielded a value of 0.167@xmath20.003mas , which is consistent with the value from the combined fit .",
    "here we used error floors of 12 and 5 @xmath24as in right ascension and declination , respectively , to achieve @xmath23 values of @xmath41 .",
    "this suggests that the systematic errors are larger in right ascension , contrary to our previous experience , where systematic errors in declination dominate .",
    "however , because the source is at high declination , systematic errors in right ascension may dominate in such a case for some geometrical configurations ( pradel et al .",
    "furthermore , the 8.6 ghz image of the calibrator j0244 + 6228 in the vlba calibrator tool shows a weak jet mainly directed toward the east .",
    "thus , small changes in this jet could introduce larger systematic errors in right ascension than in declination .",
    "the different error floors are also the reason why the parallax fit to the averaged data is slightly larger than the parallax fits to the individual features .    in order to allow for errors induced by the vlbi structure of the reference quasar",
    ", we multiply our final error by a factor of two and obtain 0.167@xmath20.006mas , which we adopt for the parallax of wb89@xmath0437 .",
    "this parallax corresponds to a distance of @xmath28kpc from the sun , or a galactocentric distance of @xmath29kpc ( assuming r@xmath7=8.5kpc ) .",
    "since we have a distance , proper motion and radial velocity , we can determine the 3-dimensional motion of wb89@xmath0437 in the galaxy .",
    "the absolute proper motion of a galactic object relative to an extragalactic source depends not only on the annual parallax but also on differential galactic rotation , the solar motion and the peculiar motion ( relative to galactic rotation ) of the object . in addition , h@xmath1o masers in star forming regions usually participate in outflows with typical velocities of a few tens of km  s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the absolute proper motions and radial velocities of maser spots can contain a significant component from internal motions .",
    "the absolute proper motions of the three maser features range from @xmath01.18 to @xmath01.35 mas  year@xmath5 in right ascension and from 0.59 to 1.05 mas  year@xmath5 in declination .",
    "the average motion of these features is @xmath01.27 @xmath2 0.05 mas  year@xmath5 in right ascension and 0.82 @xmath2 0.13 mas  year@xmath5 in declination .",
    "however , it is not clear that the average proper motion of the three maser spots represent the true motion of the whole object .",
    "to evaluate the effect of relative internal motions , we calculated the average motion of 11 maser features relative to a reference feature ( maser spot 2 with an lsr velocity of @xmath30 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "here we used all maser spots which were detected in at least two epochs and not affected by fringe - rate smearing .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 and table  3 . also given is the average proper motion together with the standard error of the mean and the standard deviation ( in parentheses ) .",
    "the average motion is -0.02 @xmath2 0.15 mas  year@xmath5 in right ascension and -0.35 @xmath2 0.18 mas  year@xmath5 in declination . the true proper motion of the whole source",
    "can then be estimated by the sum of the average motion and the absolute proper motion of the reference feature .",
    "this gives a total motion of -1.22 @xmath2 0.30 mas  year@xmath5 in right ascension and 0.46 @xmath2 0.36 mas  year@xmath5 in declination .",
    "here we also multiplied the final error by a factor of two to allow for errors induced by the background quasar .",
    "we assume iau values for the distance of the sun from the galactic center of r@xmath7=8.5  kpc and the circular rotation speed of the lsr of @xmath31=220 kms@xmath5 .",
    "we also adopt the solar motion with respect to the lsr in kms@xmath5 from hipparcos data , ( u , v , w ) = ( @xmath32 ) ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "then our distance measurement of 6.0@xmath20.2kpc , the proper motion of @xmath01.22@xmath20.30 masyear@xmath5 in right ascension and 0.46@xmath20.36 masyear@xmath5 in declination , and a radial velocity of @xmath072@xmath22 kms@xmath5 from co and cs measurements ( brand et al . 2001 ) , which should be close to the stellar velocity , implies a peculiar motion relative to a circular galactic rotation of :    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 denotes the velocity component toward the galactic center , @xmath35 is the component in direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath36 is the component toward the north galactic pole .",
    "if one uses a different rotation model of the milky way with r@xmath7=8.0kpc and @xmath31=236kms@xmath5 , which is consistent with the measured proper motion of the galactic center super - massive black hole , sgr a * ( reid & brunthaler 2004 ) , we get    @xmath37    hence , wb89@xmath0437 rotates in both cases with the approximately same velocity as the lsr but shows a large peculiar motion of @xmath38 km  s@xmath5 toward the galactic center .",
    "the galactocentric distance of wb89@xmath0437 is 13.4  kpc ( for r@xmath7=8.5kpc ) , which places the source well outside the perseus spiral arm , which is at a galactocentric distance of @xmath39 kpc in this direction ( xu et al .",
    "2006 , hachisuka et al .",
    "while the distribution of molecular gas in the outer galaxy shows that the outer arm becomes much weaker near @xmath40 ( nakanishi & sofue 2006 ) , some co clouds with high radial velocities are distributed from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( digel et al .",
    "this indicates that wb89@xmath0437 ( at @xmath3 ) is located in a weak extension of the outer arm .",
    "potential arm objects at @xmath43 have been identified ( russeil et al . 2007 ) which suggest that this faint arm continues to the third galactic quadrant .",
    "this view is supported by honma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who used the vera array and measured the annual parallax and proper motion of a h@xmath1o maser at a galactic longitude of 196@xmath6 .",
    "they found a galactocentric distance of 13.6 kpc ( for r@xmath7=8.5kpc ) , consistent with it being in the outer arm .",
    "there are many maser sources at the outer galaxy whose annual parallax have not been measured . with direct measurements of distances to these sources , we may understand the structure of the outer ( and the perseus ) arm in more detail .    with a galactic latitude of @xmath44 and a distance of 6 kpc , wb89 - 437",
    "is located @xmath4300 pc above the galactic plane . with our upper limit of 10 kms@xmath5 for the motion perpendicular to the plane ,",
    "it would have needed more than 30 million years to reach its current position .",
    "this is much larger than the age of this object .",
    "thus , wb89 - 437 must have formed already far above the plane .",
    "the annual parallax distance to wb89@xmath0437 ( 6.0@xmath20.2 kpc ) is significantly smaller than its kinematic distance of 8.6@xmath20.4 kpc , assuming recommended iau values r@xmath7 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , we note that our measured distance is in slightly better agreement with the kinematic distance of 7.3@xmath20.3 kpc that one obtains for r@xmath7=8.0kpc and @xmath31=236kms@xmath5 ( reid & brunthaler 2004 ) , but there is still a significant discrepancy .",
    "the large peculiar motion of wb89@xmath0437 of @xmath420 kms@xmath5 toward the galactic center has a component of @xmath410 kms@xmath5 toward the sun and is partially responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "this is similar to the case of w3oh ( xu et al .",
    "2006 ; hachisuka et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is located at a similar galactic longitude but is in the perseus arm .",
    "w3oh also shows a large peculiar motion and a true distance which is smaller than the kinematic distance .",
    "anomalous motions in the perseus arm are well known to exist ( humphreys 1978 ) ; they could be caused by spiral density waves .",
    "on the other hand , since the outer arm in the galaxy is a faint arm , one expects that the influence of a density wave on it is smaller than on an inner arm .",
    "in fact , spiral structure of hi gas at large galactic radii ( @xmath4525 kpc ) is not seen ( levine et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a flat rotation curve of the outer galaxy implies the existence of dark matter since the density of visible matter in the outer galaxy is smaller than in the inner galaxy .",
    "the measured circular orbital speed of wb89@xmath0437 is consistent with that of the lsr .",
    "this confirms the result of honma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that the rotation curve of the milky way is constant out to @xmath413.5 kpc and provides more solid evidence for the existence of dark matter in the outer region of the galaxy .",
    "however , since massive star forming regions can have large peculiar motions , it may be possible , although unlikely , that the rotation curve falls by @xmath46 kms@xmath5 between the sun and the outer arm , but the source has a compensating component in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "we performed astrometric vlba observations toward the galactic h@xmath1o maser source wb89@xmath0437 in the outer arm of the galaxy .",
    "the measured annual parallax of 0.167@xmath20.006 mas corresponds to a heliocentric distance of 6.0@xmath47 kpc ( a galactocentric distance of 13.4 @xmath2 0.2 kpc ) .",
    "this confirms the presence of a faint outer arm in the direction of @xmath3 . our measured distance is smaller than the kinematic distance of 8.6 kpc .",
    "we also estimate the 3d motion of the object with respect to a galactic reference frame and find that the discrepancy between kinematic distance and true distance is caused , in part , by a large peculiar motion of @xmath420 kms@xmath5 toward the galactic center .",
    "we also find that wb89 - 437 has the same rotation speed as the lsr , confirming a flat rotation curve in the outer galaxy .",
