    "the mechanisms for particle production in @xmath1+au collisions at rhic may be different at forward and backward rapidities .",
    "the partons from the deuteron - side ( forward rapidity ) are expected to undergo multiple scattering while traversing the gold nucleus .",
    "those on the gold - side ( backward rapidity ) are likely to be affected by the properties of the nucleus .",
    "a comparative study of particle production at forward and backward rapidity can be carried out using a ratio called the rapidity asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) , which is defined as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are forward and backward particle yields , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 may provide unique information to help determine the relative contributions of various physics processes to particle production , such as multiple scattering , nuclear shadowing , recombination of thermal partons , and parton saturation .",
    "recently , models incorporating different physics effects have described the nuclear modification factor for @xmath1+au collisions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "models including shadowing effects or nuclear modifications to the nucleon parton distributions reproduce reasonably well @xmath15 for inclusive charged hadrons  @xcite . those based on transverse momentum broadening ( cronin effect  @xcite ) , dynamical",
    "shadowing , and energy loss in cold nuclear matter  @xcite , also give @xmath15 predictions for inclusive charged hadrons , consistent with experimental data .",
    "models based on the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach reproduce the @xmath0 dependence of inclusive charged hadron @xmath15 at both mid- and forward - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "these models also qualitatively describe the pseudorapidity asymmetry for inclusive charged hadrons in @xmath1+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "another approach based on hadronization by recombination of thermal partons at lower @xmath0 has been quite successful in describing the observed @xmath15 for charged hadrons at rhic  @xcite .",
    "this approach emphasizes the hadronization portion of the final state interaction .",
    "although it takes into account the hard scattering in pqcd , the fragmentation is replaced by recombination of soft and shower partons in the intermediate @xmath0 region .",
    "also , a phenomenological approach , called epos  @xcite , based on a parton model , has described the @xmath1+au collision data at rhic . in this model the nuclear effects are included through elastic and inelastic parton ladder splitting .",
    "it is of interest to see how these models compare to data for rapidity asymmetry of identified hadrons from @xmath1+au collisions .",
    "more precisely , identified hadron @xmath11 , a more differential quantity , may allow some determination of the relative contribution of the physical processes discussed above .",

    "the present study will investigate if such particle type ( baryon and meson ) dependence is observed in @xmath11 for @xmath1+au collisions .    in addition to providing insight into different particle production mechanisms at forward and backward rapidity for @xmath1+au collisions , the measurements presented here may be used to study the presence of possible effects of valence quarks and isospin on particle production . at high @xmath0 and rapidities away from midrapidity ,",

    "if the flavor distribution in sea quarks is uniform and the incoming gold nucleus has no asymmetry in @xmath17 and @xmath1 quarks , one expects the ratio @xmath20 @xmath21 1 .",
    "this difference between forward and backward rapidity may be more pronounced for @xmath22 .",
    "study of particle ratios as a function of rapidity at high @xmath0 in peripheral and @xmath16-tag events for @xmath1+au collisions may provide some information on the flavor dependence of particle production .",
    "these ratios are in principle sensitive to the fragmentation function ratios of @xmath17-quarks to @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite , to the ratio of @xmath23-quarks fragmenting to protons  @xcite , and to the fractional contributions of quarks and gluons to hadrons at the given momentum .    in this paper , we present the first results for the rapidity asymmetry of charged pion , proton and anti - proton production at high @xmath0 for @xmath1+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev measured by the star experiment  @xcite at rhic .",
