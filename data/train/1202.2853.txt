    "the rotation curves of galaxies are direct probes of the shape of their gravitational fields and their matter content . that the inferred circular velocities remain approximately constant , even at large distances from the central luminous matter",
    ", is the strongest evidence for the presence of dark matter at galactic scales  @xcite .    despite its simplicity and remarkable success in accounting for observations over a wide range of scales , explaining galactic rotation curves with dark matter",
    "remains a hypothesis ; to date the candidate dark matter particles have eluded direct detection  @xcite . in the meantime , several possible modifications to the theory of gravity have been explored in attempts to explain the observed galactic rotation curves the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) framework has been the most successful attempt phenomenologically  @xcite , but suffers from the fact that it is not relativistic . as a result , it can not be used in its empirical form to generate predictions for gravitational lensing or for the dynamical evolution of systems at scales comparable to the hubble scale .",
    "earlier  @xcite attempts to develop a relativistic theory of gravity that mimics the mond phenomenology often faced fundamental difficulties , such as problems with causality or inadequacies in accounting for gravitational lensing in galaxies .",
    "more recently , new models  @xcite have been developed to resolve these difficulties , but they introduce several additional fields and auxiliary functions .",
    "such additions negate the most appealing aspect of the original mond , i.e. , that galactic rotation curves and the tully - fisher relation were accounted for with the introduction of a single acceleration scale .",
    "most previous attempts aim to reproduce the mond phenomenology by modifying the general relativistic field equations .",
    "however , in principle , the mond phenomenology can also be achieved in the non - relativistic limit by modifying the equivalence principle , i.e. , the inertia of test particles  @xcite.which of the two aspects of the theory of gravity need to be altered in order to account for the observed rotation curves of galaxies , in the absence of dark matter ?",
    "this question can not be resolved solely with observations of the non - relativistic doppler shifts of tracer particles .",
    "ideas involving violations of the equivalence principle have been tested empirically , within the dark matter interpretation of galactic rotation curves  @xcite , but not in the framework of modified gravity    in this article , we aim to address this question by calculating the second order special- and general - relativistic corrections to the doppler shifts of atomic lines used to infer the rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "similar calculations in general relativity , as well as strategies for using such measurements to map the spacetimes of galaxies have been reported in previous studies  @xcite . here",
    "we focus only on the second - order effects and evaluate them using only the symmetries of the spacetime .",
    "more importantly , we show explicitly that , if the underlying theory of gravity obeys the equivalence principle , then the second - order effects can be determined entirely using knowledge of the non - relativistic doppler shifts and without any assumptions regarding the underlying field equations of the theory . as a result , the relation between non - relativistic and relativistic effects can be used as a test of the equivalence principle at galactic scales , independent of whether dark matter or modified gravitational field equations are responsible for the flat rotation curves .",
    "we begin by assuming that the gravitational potential of a galaxy exhibits a high degree of axisymmetry .",
    "we will ultimately calculate the second - order doppler shifts and the gravitational corrections assuming that the spacetime of each galaxy is asymptotically flat .",
    "this approach is formally appropriate only for a galaxy in an otherwise empty universe ; in a subsequent section , we correct for the cosmological redshift of the galaxy .",
    "our assumptions motivate our choice of metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are undetermined functions of the coordinate radius @xmath5 and the polar angle @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath2 coefficient is associated with frame - dragging , which we expect not to be significant for galaxies and will be neglected henceforth . for comparison , we recall that in general relativity , the external spacetime of a spherically symmetric object is unique and is given by the schwarzschild solution , for which @xmath7 , @xmath8 and , @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the gravitational constant and @xmath11 is the gravitational mass of the object . because of the assumption of the validity of the equivalence principle , matter and photons follow geodesics in the spacetime described by the metric  ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "we describe the motion of a massive particle in terms of its 4-velocity @xmath12 .",
    "we choose our coordinate system so that the orbit of the particles we study will lie on the equatorial plane , i.e. , we will set @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the requirement @xmath15 for the 4-velocity of a massive particle leads to the constraint @xmath16    for a particle in a circular orbit at coordinate radius @xmath17",
    ", we require that the radial component of its 4-velocity is zero , which makes equation  ( [ eq : vparticle ] ) a constraint on @xmath18 and @xmath19 this constraint is also true for the turning points in an elliptical orbit .",
    "what sets a circular orbit apart is the fact that all points in the trajectory are turning points , i.e. , that @xmath20 which specifies the @xmath18 component of the 4-velocity uniquely @xmath21 we can use expression  ( [ eq : vparticle ] ) to solve for the @xmath22 component of the 4-velocity .",
    "whatever our theory of gravity is , we expect that the outer regions of the galaxies are in the weak field , so we can find an approximation to the desired accuracy by expanding our metric away from the flat solution @xmath23 where we have introduced @xmath24 merely as a dummy parameter that allows us to keep track of the expansion order .",
    "we denote the leading order correction to the metric element as @xmath25 , because we are counting orders in terms of the expansion of the velocity , which will be proportional to the square root of @xmath26 . using relations  ( [ eq : vparticle])([eq : gttexp ] )",

    "moreover , because we are considering a static observer , its 4-velocity is @xmath36 , and the denominator of the fraction in equation  ( [ eq : red_1 ] ) is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "the 4-velocity of the emitting particle is given by relations  ( [ eq : ut])-([eq : uphi ] ) , which after inserting into equation  ( [ eq : red_1 ] ) leads to @xmath38 in this expression , we have dropped the subscripts ` e ' and ` obs ' for the emitter and the observer .",
    "it is implicitly understood , however , that the redshift @xmath39 is measured at the location of the observer , whereas all the quantities in the right - hand side of the expression are evaluated at the location of the emitter .",

    ", we first discuss the orientation and geometry of the galaxy , the observer , and the photon trajectories in flat spacetime .",
    "all corrections due to lensing appear as factors of at least order @xmath41 , which is beyond the order we are considering here .    .",
    "photons with momentum @xmath42 are emitted within a ring ( dark yellow ) about the galactic center and arrive to the observer s image plane @xmath43 with impact parameter @xmath44 .",

    "we use the axisymmetry of the galaxy to choose the orientation of the @xmath47 axis so that the center of the image plane of the distant observer lies on the @xmath49 plane .",
    "we then set a new coordinate system ( indicated by primed quantities ) by rotating the original coordinate system around the @xmath50axis by angle @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath51 plane of the new coordinate system is parallel to the image plane and the unit vector to the image plane is parallel to the @xmath52 axis @xmath53    coordinates on the image plane and coordinates on the galaxy plane are related via the rotation @xmath54 for an emitter in a circular orbit on the galactic plane at a radius @xmath17 and at an azimuth @xmath55 with respect to the @xmath50axis , this relation becomes @xmath56 if we do not consider the bending of the trajectory of a photon due to gravitatonal lensing , then the @xmath57 and @xmath58 coordinates calculated with the last relation will correspond to the location on the image plane where the photon emitted by the orbiting object will be detected .",
    "the impact parameter of that photon will , therefore , be equal to @xmath59    for a photon with wave vector @xmath42 to intersect the image plane at a right angle and with an impact parameter @xmath44 we require @xmath60 , so @xmath61 .",

    "the relation between the first- and second - order terms is the quadratic @xmath71 and second - order effects are always suppressed compared to the first - order effects .",
    "observations  @xcite suggest that , to leading order , the velocity profiles of galaxies are very nearly flat over the radii of interest , i.e. , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the inferred , nearly constant rotational velocity , at a characteristic length scale @xmath74 and we have introduced the small parameter @xmath75 to describe weak deviations from a constant velocity profile .",
    "such a rotation law implies that the spacetime of the galaxy is described , to leading order , by @xmath76 in this last expression for the special case @xmath77 , we have introduced as an integration constant the radius @xmath78 at which the correction term @xmath26 drops rapidly to zero . if a dark matter halo with a density profile @xmath79 is responsible for the flat rotation curve of a galaxy , then @xmath80 is the outer cut - off of the halo , which is necessary for the total mass of the halo to be finite .",
    "the exact value of this constant does not affect the calculation of the redshift to first order .    using equation  ( [ eq : ord1 ] ) for the @xmath81element of the metric",
    ", we now calculate the next order correction to the redshift as @xmath82 for the case of a perfectly flat rotation curve ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) , the sign and magnitude of the second - order wavelength shift @xmath83 depends explicitly on the cut - off radius @xmath84 . to avoid the additional complications introduced by the presence of the cut - off radius , hereafter",
    ", we will assume @xmath85 and not discuss any longer the singular case of a perfectly flat rotation curve .",

    "neither of the two quantities depend on the field equations of the theory of gravity , i.e. , of the equation that determines the metric elements given a distribution of matter .",
    "we now examine the implications of the results derived in the previous section for the atomic line profiles detected from galaxies .",

    "we showed that the non - relativistic doppler shift , the relativistic ( i.e. , second - order ) doppler shift , and the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon from its origin to a distant observer depend on the magnitude and local radial derivative of the @xmath120-element of the metric , @xmath1 , at its origin .",

    "the level at which we can perform this test depends on the formal uncertainties in each measurement , as well as on the degree of azimuthal symmetry in the emission of each galaxy , which can mask the asymmtry in the line profile due to relativistic effects . to estimate the magnitude of these two sources of uncertainty , we examine some hi profiles provided as results of ongoing single beam surveys  @xcite .    as evident from fig .

    "fig : hiprofiles ] , line profiles for individual galaxies , even when they are of high signal - to - noise and sharply double peaked , can have morphologies quite different from the azimuthally symmetric case of fig .",
    "[ fig : gal ] .",
    "this variance is because the hi is not necessarily smoothly distributed and galaxies often are lopsided in the stellar or gaseous distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , even if the effect we are searching for is large , which it is is not , the nature of this measurement must be statistical .",
    "we also estimate the internal uncertainties using an estimate of the spectral noise from regions outside of the profile and 1000 simulations with noise added to the spectra . because this noise is superposed on the original spectrum , the noise of the simulations is actually @xmath150 larger , resulting in a slight overestimate of the internal uncertainties .",
    "we find that these are always smaller than the systematic errors due to intrinsic profile asymmetries .    a precision measurement of the parameter @xmath124 , which measures potential violations of the equivalence principle , requires great care in handling of the data as subtle biases can be introduced by careless binning or scaling . while we argued earlier that we could average over a suitably large distribution of inclinations , it is , in principle , possible to obtain independent measurements of the inclinations of individual galaxies which would further restrict the range of the constraints .",
    "new surveys will be releasing many thousands of galaxy spectra in the near future , which offers the possibility of placing constraints on potential equivalence principle violations on the scale of galaxies .",

    "<S> the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies require either the presence of dark matter in newtonian gravitational potentials or a significant modification to the theory of gravity at galactic scales . </S>",
    "<S> detecting relativistic doppler shifts and gravitational effects in the rotation curves offers a tool for distinguishing between predictions of gravity theories that modify the inertia of particles and those that modify the field equations . </S>",
    "<S> these higher - order effects also allow us in principle , to test whether dark matter particles obey the equivalence principle . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate here the magnitudes of the relativistic doppler and gravitational shifts expected in realistic models of galaxies in a general metric theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a number of observable quantities that measure independently the special- and general - relativistic effects in each galaxy and suggest that both effects might be detected in a statistical sense by combining appropriately the rotation curves of a large number of galaxies . </S>"
