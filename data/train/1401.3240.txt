    "the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) in the large - scale distribution of galaxies in both the sdss @xcite and 2dfgrs @xcite redshift surveys was a major milestone for cosmology , strongly supporting the standard paradigm for structure formation based on gravitational instability including cold ( or warm ) dark matter .",
    "recently , there have been several new independent measurements of the bao feature in galaxy redshift surveys , e.g. from sdss - dr8 @xcite , wigglez @xcite , 6dfgrs @xcite , an angular measurement from sdss - dr9 @xcite , and a first measurement from boss @xcite , which are all consistent with the concordance @xmath3cdm model at the few - percent level .",
    "the bao feature in galaxy clustering @xcite has a very similar origin to the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature power spectrum .",
    "most recent attention has focused on the length - scale of the bao feature , used as a standard ruler to measure cosmic distances in units of the sound horizon @xmath4 at the baryon drag epoch .",
    "many theoretical and computational studies @xcite have concluded that the comoving length - scale of the bao feature evolves by @xmath5 between the cmb era and the recent past @xmath6 due to the non - linear growth of structure , but this shift can be corrected down to the @xmath7 level using reconstruction methods @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bao feature is probably the best - understood standard ruler in the moderate - redshift universe , and when combined with cmb observations it offers great power for probing the cosmic expansion history and therefore the properties of dark energy @xcite .",
    "these bao distance measurements are complementary to those from type - ia supernovae , have potentially smaller systematic errors , and can offer direct information on the time - variable @xmath8 without differentiation . on the downside , cosmic variance sets a floor on the bao precision in the low - redshift universe , @xmath9percent at @xmath10 and worsening below this @xcite .    however , in this paper we look at a different property , specifically the overall amplitude of the bao feature , rather than the length - scale .",
    "as expected , the amplitude is mainly sensitive to the cosmic baryon fraction ( relative to total matter ) , @xmath11 . until now",
    ", the bao amplitude has received much less attention than the length - scale , for two main reasons : firstly , recent cmb results from wmap @xcite , spt @xcite and act @xcite measure the baryon fraction to around 4 percent relative precision ( given standard assumptions ) , while the strongest detection of the bao peak @xcite gives @xmath12 significance or @xmath13 error in amplitude .",
    "secondly , complications due to galaxy bias , the non - linear growth of structure , redshift - space distortions and the uncertain global shape of the power spectrum make it challenging to extract the baryon fraction from the bao feature , even with very large future redshift surveys .    however , we note that parameter estimates from the cmb are subject to a significant degeneracy between @xmath11 and the total radiation density in the cmb era , usually parametrized by an effective number of neutrino species @xmath2 .",
    "recent reviews of @xmath2 are given by e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the bao feature is sensitive to the baryon fraction rather directly : therefore , combining cmb measurements ( primarily sensitive to the physical baryon density @xmath14 and the redshift of matter - radiation equality @xmath0 ) with a bao measurement sensitive to @xmath11 may provide an interesting probe of the radiation density , @xmath2 .",
    "this may be less precise than other methods , but is largely complementary .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : bao ] we review the main effects of varying cosmological parameters , including @xmath11 and radiation density , on cmb and bao observations . in   [ sec : measfb ] we present numerical predictions of the bao feature for a set of models ( selected to give a good match to wmap ) with varying matter density and @xmath2 , and we derive a statistic based on the galaxy correlation function which is sensitive to @xmath11 and @xmath2 , but cancels galaxy bias and dark energy to leading order .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "most of this work was completed before the _ planck _ release in march 2013 , so we mainly use wmap-9 fit parameters @xcite as our baseline .",
    "the adjustments post-_planck _ are moderate , and we discuss the implications of recent _ planck _ results ( planck collaboration , @xcite ) in   [ sec : planck ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the standard notation that @xmath15 is the present - day density of species @xmath16 relative to the critical density ; and the physical density @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "the bao feature appears as a single hump in the galaxy correlation function @xmath19 , or equivalently a series of decaying wiggles in the power spectrum ( see @xcite for a clear explanation in real space , and @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the length - scale of the hump is very close to the comoving sound horizon @xmath4 at the baryon drag epoch @xmath20 ; this @xmath21 is commonly defined by the fitting formula eq .  4 of @xcite .",
    "( this formula is defined for standard @xmath2 ; however the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath2 is weak , so the error from adopting the fitting formula is small ) .",
    "this comoving length is predicted precisely mainly from cmb constraints , and several very large redshift surveys are ongoing or planned to exploit this as a standard ruler to measure cosmic distances at @xmath22 and thus probe dark energy .",
    "standard cosmological models contain a density of collisionless dark matter @xmath23 larger than the baryon density .",
    "this explains naturally why the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum have large relative amplitude , while the bao feature is relatively weak in the late - time galaxy correlation function .",
    "qualitatively , this occurs because the acoustic peaks at last scattering appeared only in the power spectrum of baryons , not dark matter : the peaks are prominent in the cmb because almost all cmb photons last scattered off a free electron . after decoupling ,",
    "the distribution of baryons and dark matter became averaged together by gravitational growth of structure over the next few @xmath24foldings between the cmb era and redshift @xmath25 @xcite , well before the formation of large galaxies .",
    "the dark matter dominates in this averaging , so the bao signal in the galaxy correlation function becomes diluted by a factor @xmath26 . in the following",
    "we define the baryon fraction as @xmath27 so that the denominator includes cdm and baryons , but excludes massive neutrinos .",
    "thus , the bao peak amplitude provides a potential measure of the baryon fraction ; this has been used as a simple and compelling argument against mond - type modified gravity theories without non - baryonic dark matter @xcite .",
    "we can make this more quantitative and use the bao feature to directly estimate the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "however , there are several reasons why this has received little attention to date :    1 .",
    "recent observations of the cmb power spectrum @xcite measure the physical baryon density @xmath14 to @xmath28 percent precision , and ( assuming standard @xmath2 ) , measure the physical matter density @xmath29 to 3 percent ; the errors on these are weakly correlated , so this gives an estimate of the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath11 to @xmath30 percent relative precision .",
    "( recent results from the _ planck _ mission have improved this to the @xmath31 percent level , see   [ sec : planck ] ) .",
    "the bao feature is affected by several effects : it is blurred by the non - linear growth of structure , and amplified by galaxy bias , which is challenging to measure and may also be scale - dependent .",
    "the overall large - scale shape of the galaxy power spectrum also depends on other cosmological parameters , and this will also have some influence on the bao peak shape .",
    "thus , at first sight it appears that baos can not compete in precision with the cmb as a probe of @xmath11 .",
    "this is partly true , but with an important caveat : the cmb - based estimates of @xmath11 are significantly degenerate with the total radiation density in the cmb era .",
    "at this point we define our notation on densities : as usual , we define the parameter @xmath2 such that the radiation density at matter - radiation equality is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are densities of ( total ) radiation and photons respectively . here",
    "@xmath2 is an `` effective '' number of neutrinos , but in fact it is not specific to neutrinos and counts any species ( except photons ) which were relativistic until around matter - radiation equality . assuming the standard population of only three very light neutrinos with the oscillation parameters given by solar , atmospheric and beam - based neutrino experiments , the value of @xmath2 can be accurately predicted as @xmath35 @xcite ; here the additional @xmath36 arises from a small residual coupling of neutrinos to baryons and photons at the epoch of electron / positron annihilation .",
    "it is also convenient to define the scaled radiation density @xmath37 by @xmath38 where the factor of @xmath39 is the bracket in eq .",
    "[ eq - neff ] for @xmath35 ; therefore @xmath40 for standard radiation content , and for example @xmath41 for @xmath42 , i.e. the case of additional `` dark radiation '' with energy density equal to one standard neutrino flavour . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath37 are equivalent , but the latter is convenient later since several parameters of interest scale almost as half - integer powers of @xmath37 .",
    "there are now several known routes to probe @xmath2 from observations : historically it was first constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis , @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath43he is the nuclide with the main sensitivity to @xmath2 , and observational measurements of the primordial @xmath43he abundance , @xmath44 , appear to be limited by systematic errors ; over the past 25 years the estimates of @xmath44 have shifted significantly upwards , but the realistic error bars have not much improved .",
    "unless a new better method of measuring @xmath44 can be found , we can not expect dramatic progress from the helium route .",
    "recently , a constraint on @xmath2 has been derived from deuterium abundance @xcite , but this currently relies on only a single object , and also uses the baryon density derived from the cmb .",
    "secondly , the cmb damping tail at high multipoles @xmath45 is sensitive to @xmath2 @xcite ; and several recent measurements ( @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ) give tantalizing but not decisive hints for a value higher than the standard @xmath46 .",
    "however , the cmb damping tail method is significantly degenerate with other possible new parameters , including running of the spectral index @xmath47 and non - standard helium abundance @xmath44 @xcite , so other complementary probes of @xmath2 are desirable .",
    "thirdly , combining cmb data with a direct local measurement of @xmath48 can also probe @xmath2 ; however , using cmb+@xmath48 alone is critically dependent on other assumptions such as @xmath49 and flatness .",
    "an improvement on the @xmath48 method is given by @xcite , who showed that a _ theory - free _ measurement of @xmath50 can be obtained by combining a low-@xmath51 bao redshift survey and a suitable absolute distance measurement to a matched redshift ( specifically @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the characteristic redshift of the bao survey ) .",
    "this almost cancels the distance effects from dark energy and curvature ; comparing such a direct @xmath50 measurement to cmb data ( which mainly constrains @xmath54 rather than @xmath50 alone ) therefore probes @xmath2 .",
    "the above - mentioned method is less theory - dependent than the cmb damping tail , but requires a challenging measurement of a distance to @xmath6 to @xmath31 percent absolute accuracy",
    ".    we will demonstrate below that the amplitude of the bao feature provides a fourth possible probe of @xmath2 : this is currently much less precise than the known methods above , but involves different assumptions and systematics ; with future massive redshift surveys expected in the next decade , it may provide a useful complement to the better - known methods above .",
    "the present - day photon density @xmath55 is very well constrained by the observed cmb temperature @xcite and spectrum to be @xmath56 ; and we define @xmath57 to be the physical matter density today , specifically cdm and/or wdm plus baryons , excluding neutrinos . defining @xmath0 as the redshift of matter - radiation equality , and simply assuming that the photon density scales with redshift as @xmath58 , and",
    "matter conservation so cdm and baryon densities scale @xmath59 ( i.e. no decaying dark matter , dark energy to dark matter transitions , or other exotic effects ) leads to the following identities : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 the equations above are independent of assumptions about dark energy and flatness .",
    "they remain valid for the case of small non - zero neutrino mass , @xmath63 : since our definition of @xmath64 excludes the contribution from massive neutrinos today , while neutrinos this light were almost fully relativistic at the era of matter - radiation equality .",
    "this assumption is reasonable given recent upper limits on neutrino mass from cmb+galaxy clustering data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , low - mass neutrinos are matter - like at @xmath65 and do contribute to @xmath66 in late - time observables , but we treat @xmath67 as a separate contribution .",
    "we now choose a basic 6 + 1 set of cosmological parameters as @xmath68 where the first three and @xmath37 are defined above , as usual @xmath69 is the scalar perturbation amplitude ( which cancels in the following ) , @xmath47 is the scalar spectral index and @xmath70 is the optical depth to last scattering .",
    "then , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath11 are derived parameters from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omcb])([eq : fb ] ) .",
    "we may add optional parameters , curvature @xmath73 , dark energy equation of state @xmath74 and present - day neutrino density @xmath75 defaulting to @xmath76 respectively ( for minimal neutrino mass ) .",
    "then @xmath77 , and the dark energy density @xmath78 is another derived parameter , via @xmath79 .",
    "this parameter set ( [ eq : pars ] ) including @xmath0 and @xmath64 in the basic six looks unconventional compared to the more common choice including @xmath80 as two of the basic parameters ; but for variable @xmath2 , our set links more naturally to observational constraints as we will see below ; see also appendix a , and the discussion in section  4.2 of @xcite . to summarize the latter , dimensionless observables such as",
    "the cmb acoustic wavenumber @xmath81 , , with acoustic angle @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the redshift of decoupling . ] and distance ratios from bao and sne provide good constraints on dimensionless parameters including @xmath0 and @xmath64 ; but there remains one overall scale degeneracy between @xmath2 and dimensionful parameters such as @xmath48 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "( parameters such as @xmath71 , @xmath72 are only pseudo - dimensionless since they are relative to an arbitrary choice of @xmath86 , and these are affected by this degeneracy ) .",
    "it has been shown by several authors ( ) that the heights of the first few acoustic peaks in the cmb primarily constrain the redshift of matter - radiation equality @xmath0 , _ not _ the physical matter density @xmath72 . which is important in the cmb , where @xmath83 is the decoupling redshift",
    "; however in practice the relative uncertainty in @xmath83 is much smaller than in @xmath0 , so we ignore this for simplicity . ]",
    "these latter two parameters are equivalent if we force @xmath87 , but if we allow @xmath2 to be free they are no longer equivalent , and then @xmath0 is constrained much better than @xmath72 by cmb data ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the wmap data also constrains the baryon density @xmath14 accurately .",
    "the effect of baryons on the cmb derives mainly from the baryon / photon ratio ; given the photon density measured very accurately by cobe @xcite , the @xmath14 estimate from wmap is only weakly dependent on @xmath2 or @xmath37 .    measuring both @xmath14 and @xmath0",
    "immediately gives us the product @xmath88 from eq .",
    "[ eq : fb ] ; so , the key point from the above is that the first few cmb acoustic peaks provide an accurate constraint on the product @xmath88 , but @xmath11 and @xmath37 are significantly degenerate .",
    "therefore , adding a non - cmb observable which is sensitive to @xmath11 can provide another probe of @xmath2 .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that the relative amplitude of the bao peak in galaxy clustering may provide such a test : it depends mainly on @xmath11 , with weak sensitivity to other parameters .",
    "thus , comparing a bao - based estimate of @xmath11 to a cmb - based measurement ( approximately @xmath89 ) can provide a new probe of the radiation density which is largely independent of existing methods . a strong point of this method",
    "is that the cmb can measure @xmath0 using only the first three acoustic peaks ; for models near concordance parameter values , the ratio of the third to first peak height is especially sensitive to @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , and the third peak at @xmath90 is only weakly affected by silk damping which dominates at @xmath91 .",
    "thus , while we need cmb data at @xmath92 , this method is not strongly dependent on the cmb damping tail and other possible early - time nuisance parameters .",
    "we noted above that the cmb power spectrum from wmap constrains @xmath89 to @xmath93 percent , ( and this improves to @xmath94 with _ planck _ data ) ; therefore , an estimate of @xmath11 derived from the bao amplitude can translate into a probe of @xmath37 or equivalently @xmath2 .",
    "however , deriving @xmath11 from the bao feature is affected by several complications listed below : firstly there is galaxy bias , which may be scale - dependent . here",
    "we choose to work with the correlation function rather than the power spectrum , since the former makes the bao feature a single hump which simplifies the analysis . in the linear - bias approximation ,",
    "the galaxy and matter correlation functions are related by @xmath95 , therefore a suitable ratio of correlation functions near the bao bump vs outside the bump can cancel galaxy bias if it is scale - independent .",
    "this is believed to be a good approximation at linear scales @xmath96 @xcite , but a better understanding of galaxy formation may be required to clarify this .",
    "secondly , the bao bump is blurred by the non - linear growth of structure , mainly due to peculiar motions @xcite ; this both lowers its height and broadens its shape , and causes a small shift in central position .",
    "however , it is shown by @xcite that non - linear growth almost conserves the total area of the bump ; thus , measuring the bump _ area _ rather than its height is relatively insensitive to the non - linear growth of structure .",
    "thirdly , the global shape of @xmath19 , with @xmath97 in @xmath98 units , depends on other quantities including @xmath66 and dark energy equation of state , which are not tightly constrained by the cmb .",
    "however , we show later that if we define @xmath99 to be the ratio of comoving separation @xmath97 to the sound horizon scale , then the broad - band shape of @xmath100 on intermediate scales depends mostly on @xmath0 : nearly all shape dependence on other parameters is collapsed into @xmath0 , which is already well determined by the cmb .",
    "therefore , we define the following observable @xmath101 from the measured galaxy correlation function @xmath102 , as a measure of the bao `` equivalent width '' : we define @xmath103 \\ , du       \\over \\int_{u_1}^{u_2 } u^2 \\ , \\xi_{gg}(u ) \\ , du } \\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the observed galaxy correlation function in units of @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the bump scale ( here the value of @xmath97 at the peak in @xmath107 ) , and @xmath108 is a smooth `` no bump '' curve , here a polynomial fitted to the regions of @xmath104 just outside the bao bump",
    ". then @xmath109 are arbitrary dimensionless limits of integration , where @xmath110 span almost the full area of the bump ; while @xmath111 are intermediate scales non - overlapping with the bump , used for normalization .",
    "there is a compromise here , since we want to avoid the non - linear regime @xmath112 , while at @xmath113 the measurement noise in @xmath114 generally increases , and becomes more sensitive to systematic errors . in the following we choose @xmath115 as simple values which give a well - measured signal in the linear regime , and are not too far below the bump scale to minimise the possible effects of scale - dependent bias . in the above definition ,",
    "a constant bias in @xmath102 cancels out as long as it is scale - independent on large scales @xmath116 ; while a multiplicative stretch of cosmic distance scales ( e.g. from varying dark energy ) also cancels in @xmath101 , since we are measuring at fixed fractions of the comoving scale @xmath106 which is fitted from the data .",
    "the ratio between @xmath50 and the horizon size at matter - radiation equality is determined almost entirely by @xmath0 , so we expect @xmath101 defined as above to be mainly sensitive to the baryon fraction @xmath11 as desired .    to verify this and test parameter dependences , we next evaluate @xmath101 from the linear matter power spectrum for some example theoretical models generated by camb .      here",
    ", we evaluate @xmath101 ( defined above ) for a set of six representative models which are all consistent with cmb data up to 2012 .",
    "all models are flat @xmath3cdm ( @xmath117 , @xmath49 ) , and have @xmath47 fixed to 0.96 and @xmath118 in accordance with wmap .",
    "we vary @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and also adjust @xmath64 to preserve the cmb acoustic scale @xmath81 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for our `` base '' model ( hereafter c3 ) we set @xmath35 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 ; therefore @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for model c4",
    "we add a fourth light neutrino species , but retain identical values of @xmath0 and @xmath64 ; therefore c4 has @xmath72 and @xmath71 increased by @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively relative to c3 .",
    "( here @xmath14 is held at 0.0226 for both models , so model c4 has dark matter density @xmath125 increased by slightly more than 13.4% , while @xmath11 is reduced by a factor of 0.882 ) .",
    "the overall shape of the correlation function also depends significantly on @xmath0 : to explore this dependence , we choose two models ( labelled l3 , l4 ) with @xmath0 fixed to 5% lower than c3 , and respectively @xmath126 and @xmath127 ; likewise another two models ( h3 , h4 ) with @xmath0 fixed 5% higher than c3 . for these models",
    ", @xmath64 is adjusted in order to preserve the cmb acoustic scale @xmath128 .",
    "the resulting parameter values are shown in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "since these models are all flat , they do not quite follow the cmb geometrical degeneracy , but they do follow the related degeneracy of constant @xmath81 or horizon angle as outlined in @xcite .",
    "we used camb to evaluate the cmb temperature power spectra for the above six models ; these are shown in figure  [ fig : cmb ] , normalized to match model c3 at @xmath129 .",
    "clearly the cmb spectra are very similar for all our models , since the acoustic scales are matched by construction , and the variations in @xmath0 are only @xmath130 percent .",
    "minor differences are apparent , notably around the third peak ( which is positively correlated with @xmath0 ) , while the effects of @xmath2 appear mainly in the damping tail and are small at @xmath92 .",
    "we repeat here that @xmath118 and @xmath131 have been held fixed in all models for simplicity , in order to highlight the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , allowing @xmath47 and @xmath14 to float to fit cmb data would result in model spectra that are even more similar , especially if a running spectral index is also allowed .",
    "we took the linear - theory matter power spectra for the above six models generated by camb , and then fourier transformed them to obtain the real - space matter correlation functions ; these are shown in figure  [ fig : xi ] , with the @xmath132axis in units of @xmath98 corresponding to the observable from a low-@xmath51 redshift survey .    for the matter correlation functions in figure  [ fig : xi ] ,",
    "the differences between models are much more obvious than in the cmb : the position of the bao bump ( in @xmath98 units ) is insensitive to @xmath2 for fixed @xmath133 , but it does shift with @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , as explained in appendix  a , the bao bump location is more sensitive to @xmath64 than @xmath0 ; but changing @xmath0 required us to adjust @xmath64 to conserve the cmb acoustic scale , and it is actually the change in @xmath64 which dominates the shift of the bump location .",
    "the other notable feature in figure  [ fig : xi ] is that all the @xmath134 models have a slightly reduced bao peak amplitude , as qualitatively expected given their smaller @xmath11 .    to highlight the effects of varying @xmath2 , in figure  [ fig : xi_scaled ] we plot the matter correlation functions as a function of @xmath135 , so that the bao bump appears at @xmath136",
    "this figure shows clearly that the bump amplitude is mainly sensitive to @xmath2 , while the broad - band shape ( the ratio of power at @xmath137 to that at @xmath138 ) is governed mainly by @xmath0 .",
    "this is understandable since the broad - band shape is determined by the scale of the turnover in the matter power spectrum , which is directly proportional to the particle horizon size at @xmath0 .",
    "this scale in observable @xmath98 units depends on several cosmological parameters .",
    "however , as noted in e.g. eq .",
    "b2 of @xcite , the _ ratio _ of the bao sound horizon @xmath4 to the particle horizon @xmath139 at @xmath0 ( both in comoving units ) has a simpler dependence : this ratio is well approximated by simply @xmath140 since the sound speed @xmath141 is well constrained by the wmap baryon density .",
    "the dependence on other parameters such as @xmath64 , @xmath71 , @xmath37 is almost entirely compressed into @xmath0 , and the ratio is completely independent of late - time parameters such as @xmath74 , @xmath73 .",
    "thus the changes in @xmath100 in figure  [ fig : xi_scaled ] are largely driven by the differing @xmath0 and @xmath11 between the six models , and adding optional parameters such as @xmath73 , @xmath74 will have minimal effect .",
    "here it is also noteworthy that the zero - crossing in @xmath100 occurs close to @xmath142 for all the models ; this offers an interesting possible consistency test for the @xmath3cdm framework which is largely insensitive to galaxy bias .",
    "however , this is observationally challenging to measure since the zero - crossing is much more sensitive than the bao bump position and amplitude to broad - band systematic errors in the observed @xmath100 .",
    "the denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : wb ] is mainly sensitive to the broad - band large - scale power at @xmath143 , which as above depends on the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum .",
    "if we measured this in a fixed range of mpc or @xmath98 , this would depend on quantities such as @xmath64 and @xmath74 , which would seriously degrade our ability to measure @xmath11 ; but since we chose our mid - scale power estimate as a fixed _ fraction _ of the bao length rather than a fixed range in @xmath98 , this mostly cancels the dependence on low - redshift parameters such as @xmath64 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; the broad - band shape of @xmath100 at @xmath144 depends almost entirely on @xmath0 and @xmath47 , which are already well constrained by the cmb .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that @xmath101 should depend mainly on @xmath11 and only weakly on @xmath0 .",
    "to quantify this , we evaluated the ratio @xmath101 for our six models , and the results are given in the last column of table  [ tab : models ] : the table shows that @xmath101 is close to @xmath145 for all three @xmath126 models , and close to @xmath146 for all three @xmath134 models , consistent with our expectations above .",
    "the dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath0 is below 1% and nearly negligible , while adding a fourth neutrino species or equivalent reduces @xmath101 by a factor close to @xmath147 ( i.e. 8.5% suppression ) in each case .",
    "this reduction is slightly less than we would expect from linear scaling @xmath148 , since our @xmath134 models have @xmath11 reduced by a factor @xmath149 relative to the corresponding @xmath126 model .",
    "the probable explanation is that baryons , in addition to causing oscillations , also affect the broad - band shape of the power spectrum @xcite by suppressing power on all scales smaller than the sound horizon .",
    "therefore , reducing the baryon fraction slightly increases power on intermediate scales , and changes the broad - band shape of @xmath100 , which slightly counteracts the reduction in the bump area .",
    "the conclusion is that , _ if _ galaxy bias is scale - independent on large scales and the area of the bao peak is conserved under non - linear evolution ( or can be recovered by reconstruction methods ) , then measurements of @xmath101 can offer a potential new probe of @xmath2 .",
    "estimates from large numerical simulations could be used to test these assumptions , and possibly attempt to correct for any resulting biases .",
    "the largest current redshift surveys provide a @xmath12 detection of the bao peak @xcite , which would translate to approximately 16 percent uncertainty in @xmath101 ; this is twice as large as the 8.5 percent shift predicted above for @xmath150 , so at present the precision on @xmath2 looks uncompetitive with other methods . however , future next - generation large redshift surveys can potentially offer a large improvement , and thus an interesting test of @xmath2 which is complementary to the better - known methods from the cmb and nucleosynthesis .",
    "most of this paper studies models with parameter choices based on the wmap-9 cosmological parameter results @xcite ; the c3 model is near the best - fit , and l and h models have @xmath0 shifted by @xmath151 in wmap units . after this paper",
    "was nearly completed , the first _",
    "cosmology data release occurred in 2013 march . while there are many interesting consequences for inflation and the early universe , for the present purposes , two results are most notable : firstly concerning @xmath2 , the evidence for @xmath152 has generally weakened @xcite , but the strength of this conclusion is somewhat dependent on the choice of additional data sets .    the fit @xmath3cdm + varying @xmath2 to the dataset `` _ planck _ + wmap polarisation +",
    "high - l + bao '' ( the right column of table  10 of @xcite ) gives @xmath153 , which is @xmath154 above the standard value and excludes @xmath134 at the @xmath155 level .",
    "however , there remains the well - publicised tension that _ planck _ with vanilla @xmath3cdm ( and @xmath126 ) prefers a value of @xmath156 , which is below the @xmath157 range given by recent local measurements ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are many possible explanations , but this @xmath48 tension can be ameliorated by increasing @xmath2 : e.g. fitting _ planck _ + @xmath48 data allowing variable @xmath2 gives @xmath158 and @xmath159 , i.e. @xmath160 above the standard @xmath2 . in summary",
    ", @xmath161 is somewhat disfavoured by _ planck _ , but a value of @xmath162 is completely allowed or perhaps even preferred by combining all current data .",
    "there are interesting possible models with extra relativistic species other than neutrinos leading to @xmath162 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    secondly , concerning @xmath0 and @xmath64 , the _ planck _",
    "data imply values somewhat higher than wmap ; for the vanilla @xmath3cdm model , fits to _ planck_+bao data give @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( and @xmath165 for standard @xmath2 ) .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "constraints on @xmath0 are especially robust : in the many extensions of @xmath3cdm considered by the _ planck _",
    "team , the bounds @xmath166 are generic , i.e. values outside this range are excluded at @xmath167 for all of the added - parameter models and data combinations .",

    "central value @xmath168 is near the mid - point between our model pairs c and h above , but slightly closer to h. our two l models ( @xmath169 ) are now firmly excluded by _ planck _ , at around the @xmath170 level for the base model or @xmath171 for extended models . also , _",
    "_ prefers @xmath172 which is just 2 percent below our default ; and @xmath173 which is nearly identical .",
    "thus , while _ planck _ has narrowed the allowed range of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , our models c3/c4/h3/h4 approximately bracket the range of @xmath0 and @xmath2 allowed by _",
    "planck _ ; and the main conclusions of this paper regarding the bao amplitude are essentially unaffected .",
    "we have shown that a measurement of the bao peak amplitude via the observable @xmath101 in eq .",
    "[ eq : wb ] may provide an interesting measurement of the cosmic baryon fraction ; this observable has been constructed so as to cancel galaxy bias , non - linearity and dark energy effects to leading order , thus being sensitive mostly to @xmath11 .",
    "comparing this bao - based measurement to the measurement of ( approximately ) @xmath89 from the cmb then gives an interesting probe of @xmath2 ; this is largely complementary to the better - known method based on fitting the cmb damping tail . here , the key inputs required from the cmb are constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath14 . assuming standard gravity and standard recombination , these two parameters are very robust against extra - parameter extensions to vanilla @xmath3cdm .",
    "there are two main assumptions used here : firstly that galaxy bias is nearly scale - independent on the large scales between @xmath174 , and secondly that the area ( not height ) of the bao bump is conserved during the non - linear evolution of structure . both of these assumptions are reasonably well - motivated , but much more detailed numerical simulations would be needed to see how well these approximations are expected to hold in practice .    a measurement of @xmath101 to useful precision will require a substantial advance on current data : the current precision on the bao bump area is around 16% , while we would need to reach around @xmath175 to get a useful distinction between @xmath176 or 4 ; this appears a challenging proposition .",
    "however , given that the cmb temperature measurements are now approaching the limits set by cosmic variance and foregrounds , other independent probes of @xmath2 are highly desirable , and the test here should become feasible at no extra cost from planned next - generation bao redshift surveys .",

    "in this section we give some accurate approximations for the dependence of cmb acoustic scale and bao distance ratios on cosmological parameters , especially @xmath0 and @xmath64 used as basic parameters above .",
    "this helps to understand the parameter choices in table  [ tab : models ] , and the resulting shifts in bao bump position observed in ",
    "[ sec : camb ] .",
    "firstly , we find that a very good approximation to the cmb acoustic wavenumber @xmath81 for models fairly close to standard @xmath3cdm is @xmath177\\ ] ] where @xmath178 , and this allows for small neutrino mass , weak curvature and constant @xmath179 .",
    "( this is for @xmath118 ; however , changing to the planck value @xmath180 gives only around 0.1 percent reduction in @xmath181 ) .",
    "this has almost negligible dependence on @xmath2 , since varying @xmath2 ( at fixed @xmath182 as above ) results in both @xmath183 and @xmath184 shrinking by a factor very close to @xmath185 , but these cancel almost exactly in @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath81 is measured to high precision @xmath186 percent by wmap+act+spt , if we vary @xmath0 ( as in the l / h models in table  [ tab : models ] above ) , then to remain consistent with cmb data we must adjust other parameter(s ) to preserve @xmath81 . given our assumption of flat @xmath3 models and minimal neutrino mass in ",
    "[ sec : measfb ] , the only available parameter above is @xmath64 . forcing a 5% reduction in @xmath0 ( as chosen for models l3/l4 ) requires a 12% reduction in @xmath64 to keep @xmath81 the same as the baseline model c3 ; this corresponds to an increase in @xmath71 by 3.6% ( at fixed @xmath2 ) .",
    "shifts from c to h models are basically the opposite of this .",
    "we note one counter - intuitive feature : when varying parameters to conserve @xmath81 , it turns out that @xmath71 changes in the _ opposite _ sense to @xmath0 ; this is distinct from the common case of fixing @xmath64 and varying @xmath71 , when @xmath187 varies @xmath188 .",
    "we can also understand the resulting shifts in the bao bump location as follows : if we copy approximation ( 12 ) from @xcite for low - redshift bao ratios , which is @xmath189 here the lhs is a direct observable from a bao survey at effective redshift @xmath51 , @xmath190 is the usual bao dilation length @xcite , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 is a small cosmology - dependent correction term @xcite , which is typically @xmath193 and effectively negligible at modest redshift @xmath194 . approximation  [ eq : omez ] is accurate to @xmath195 at @xmath196 , comparable to the cosmic variance limit , and again this is almost independent of @xmath2 . at low redshift ,",
    "[ eq : omez ] is only weakly sensitive to additional non - vanilla parameters such as curvature and varying @xmath74 via the @xmath197 term ; this explains why low - redshift bao observations provide a very robust constraint on @xmath64 .    in the limit @xmath198",
    ", the above simplifies to @xmath199 the lhs is equivalent to a hypothetical bao measurement at @xmath200 ; this is not strictly observable since cosmic variance prevents us measuring the bao feature at @xmath201 ; but it is a modest extrapolation from real low-@xmath51 bao surveys . the main point is since a galaxy redshift survey of course measures redshifts not distances , the apparent bao bump `` length '' presented in @xmath98 units , as in figure  [ fig : xi ] , is really measuring the `` bao velocity '' @xmath202 in units of @xmath203 .",
    "although this quantity contains @xmath71 , in the case of varying @xmath2 this gets cancelled : if we vary @xmath2 while holding fixed @xmath0 ( as appropriate for fitting cmb data ) , then @xmath71 and @xmath50 both depend on the radiation density as @xmath204 and @xmath205 respectively ; so their product is almost independent of @xmath37 and only depends on the dimensionless parameters @xmath0 and @xmath64 , plus a very weak dependence on @xmath14 which is negligible at the current level of accuracy .",
    "therefore , the observed velocity scale of the bao feature at low redshift is primarily measuring @xmath64 , not @xmath71 , which explains why the bao feature does not shift between the 3 and 4 neutrino model pairs in ",
    "[ sec : camb ] .",
    "since all of the approximations above are nearly independent of @xmath2 , this was the rationale for choosing @xmath0 and @xmath64 as two of the basic parameters : observations of cmb and baos give us direct constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath64 , nearly independent of @xmath2 .",
    "these two directly give a constraint on @xmath206 from eq .",
    "[ eq : hzeq ] , but give almost no ability to measure @xmath71 , @xmath37 separately ; this explains why wmap+bao alone currently have very weak leverage on @xmath2 , unless further dimensionful data such as @xmath48 or @xmath84 is added ."
