    "the innermost planet , kepler-10b , was the first confirmed rocky planet discovered by _",
    "kepler _ and orbits its star in only 0.84 days .",
    "a second transiting planet , kepler-10c , is a super - earth with a radius of about 2@xmath3 and a 45-day period @xcite .",
    "while kepler-10b induces detectable radial velocity variations in the host star as it orbits , kepler-10c does not , so its mass is not known .",
    "possible false positive scenarios for kepler-10c have been ruled out using the blender analysis @xcite including an observed transit at 4.5  @xmath4 m with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .",
    "the properties of the host star were previously determined by @xcite using asteroseismology , based on five months of _ kepler _ data . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the asteroseismic analysis based on a dataset that is now about six times as long .",
    "we derive accurate stellar parameters ; in particular , we set out to constrain the age of the star and its planets , which potentially is high ( @xmath5 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "the age also enters in composition models of kepler-10b ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which , together with corot-7b @xcite , has been the subject of many studies of planetary dynamics and migration , because of its small size and proximity to the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the planet is thought to have a mercury - like composition @xcite , with a large iron core and silicate mantle @xcite .",
    "the origin of the planet could be a rocky planet which has lost a thin hydrogen envelope @xcite or the remnant of a jupiter - mass giant planet @xcite .",
    "the planet s short period also results in a detectable full planetary phase curve , by measuring the increase in flux as the dayside of the tidally locked planet rotates into view , as well as an occultation , when the planet disappears behind its star .",
    "analyzing the phase curve allows for an estimate of the planetary temperature and albedo . together with the very recently discovered kepler-78 @xcite ,",
    "this is the only terrestrial exoplanet for which this is possible .",
    "the first detection of the phase curve and occultation @xcite was later physically interpreted using a _ lava - ocean _ hypothesis : a planet without atmosphere and a surface partially covered with molten rocks @xcite .",
    "we use the far longer time series currently available , to measure the phase curve amplitude and occultation depth at a significantly improved accuracy .    in section",
    "[ sec : asteroseismology ] , we present the results of a detailed asteroseismic analysis .",
    "we use the new stellar parameters to fit the planetary transits to higher precision ( section  [ sec : transit ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : phasecurve ] , we analyze the amplitude of the phase curve and the depth of the occultation ; these values are interpreted in terms of temperature and albedo in section [ sec : albedo ] .",
    "the asteroseismic analysis was based on the _ kepler _ raw fluxes , which were acquired using simple aperture photometry and uncorrected for any instrumental effects .",
    "short - cadence data ( which have a sampling rate of 58.8 seconds ) were used up to _ kepler _ quarter 14 , where a quarter ( q ) normally contains three months of data . due to a hardware failure in q4 , the target",
    "was only observed during its first month and subsequently not observed during q8 and q12 , resulting in a total of 29 months of observations which were used .",
    "we analyzed the data from each month separately , correcting for transit - like signatures , long - term trends and bad data points ( outliers ) .",
    "the long - term corrections were done by a median filtering algorithm which removes all trends with a time scale longer than 0.7 days .",
    "transit - like signatures were removed by applying a median filter ( with a 40-minute time scale ) to all parts of the time series where the data deviate significantly from the 0.7 day median filter . since we modeled the phase curve for the two known exoplanets in the kepler-10b system an alternative would have been to remove the transit signatures directly after constructing the phase curve ( see section  [ sec : phasecurve ] ) .",
    "we decided to use a general algorithm ( the median filter described above ) for removal of any transit - like signature in order not to depend on modeling the exoplanet system .",
    "the difference between the median filter and a direct removal of the phase curve for each known exoplanet is insignificant and the frequency where the p - modes are present and the individual measured p - mode frequencies do not depend on the choice of algorithm for removal of transit - like signatures and long - term trends .",
    "the noise level at high frequencies is not substantially affected by the transits , and only the lowest dozen harmonics of the exoplanet period contains significant power .",
    "the lowest detected p - mode frequency corresponds to a period which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the period of kepler-10b .",
    "we used the resulting differential photometry and estimated errors to obtain the power spectrum .",
    "we first calculated a weighted power spectrum for each month of data separately , with the weights proportional to the inverse of the variance .",
    "we then combined the monthly power spectra , each weighted by the square of the inverse of the median of its power spectrum .",
    "this resulting final power spectrum , which we used for the asteroseismic analysis , has a resolution of about 0.4 @xmath4hz ( figure  [ fig : power ] , top ) .",
    "we extracted the individual oscillation peaks by calculating the power - weighted frequency position for each peak in the spectrum . from the distribution of random peaks in the spectrum , we estimated a detection threshold above which any power is likely to be real , either stellar oscillations or a coherent signal in the instrument .",
    "we identified the orders and degrees of the individual extracted p - modes from the structure of the frequencies using the large and small frequency separation .",
    "we estimated errors in frequencies using a monte carlo simulation where we injected signals in the time series at similar power levels to those observed , extracted them , then compared the input and output frequencies .",

    "we used the aarhus stellar pulsation code ( adipls ; * ? ? ? * ) to compute the frequencies of relevant models in the grid , corrected for the near - surface deficiencies in the modeling essentially following the procedure of @xcite but adapted to include modes of all degrees ( see * ? ? ?",

    "diffusion of helium and heavy elements is included using the @xcite prescription .",
    "the grid comprises masses between @xmath21 , with the initial composition selected by exploring a range of initial helium abundances between @xmath22 . for each of these initial values of helium ,",
    "models for six metallicities that cover the 1@xmath23 spectroscopic range of [ fe / h ] are calculated .",
    "we computed frequencies for the models using adipls , and calculate the @xmath18 fit to frequency combinations and spectroscopic data as described in @xcite .",

    "as for the asteroseismic analysis ( section  [ sec : asteroseismology ] ) , we exclusively use the available short - cadence observations for the planetary analysis .",
    "we again start out from raw data ( simple aperture photometry ) , to avoid that prior data corrections affect the analysis of the planetary phase curve ( see section  [ sec : phasecurve ] for details ) .    for both kepler-10b and kepler-10c",
    ", we first determine the time of central transit for each individual transit throughout the whole time series .",
    "this is done by fitting a transit curve to each individual transit .",
    "the orbital period is determined by fitting a straight line to the transit times vs. the transit numbers , assuming a constant orbital period .",
    "the assumption of constant period is verified by investigating possible transit timing variations ( ttvs ) , using a power spectrum of the o - c ( observed - calculated ) residuals , which could indicate a periodic signal from a perturbing object .",
    "we found no evidence of ttvs and place an upper limit of 2 minutes on the amplitude of any sinusoidal variations .",
    "the periods are listed in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "we analyzed the phase - folded and binned data using the transit analysis package ( tap ) described in @xcite .",
    "tap uses markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations to fit the transit model with the analytical methods described by @xcite .",
    "the model outputs from the mcmc analysis are inclination , @xmath28 , scaled semi - major axis , @xmath29 , relative radius , @xmath30 , as well as linear and quadratic limb - darkening ( ld ) coefficients .",
    "we leave the ld coefficients as free fitting parameters , but they are unique to both transit fits as they are fitted simultaneously .",
    "we assessed the circularity of orbits of kepler-10b and -10c by comparing the stellar densities calculated from transit parameters to those determined by other means as described in @xcite . in this case",
    ", we used the value for stellar density obtained by asteroseismic analysis .",
    "however , this means that we can not use the transit parameters listed in table  [ table : parameters ] , as they used the asteroseismic stellar density as a prior and fixed the orbit to be circular .",
    "this would mean that the fitting algorithm would be naturally biased towards solutions that return circular orbits .",
    "therefore , in order to assess an unknown eccentricity , it is important to use a fitting approach that only fits the transit and does not attempt to fit orbital parameters as well .",
    "we therefore used transit parameters given in rowe et al .",
    "( submitted ) , which are fit in this manner .",
    "we find that the minimum eccentricities for both planets are consistent with 0 : @xmath31 for kepler-10b and @xmath32 for kepler-10c , which supports the use of the asteroseismic stellar density as a prior in the transit fits ( a correction term which depends on the eccentricity and angle of periastron would have to be included in case of an eccentric orbit ) .",
    "we used this eccentricity information along with the derived period and the stellar mass to recalculate the mass of kepler-10b using the radial - velocity semi - amplitude that was observed by @xcite ; see table  [ table : parameters ] .    running the tap routine",
    "provides poor constraints on the inclination angle for both exoplanets .",
    "for instance , in the kepler-10b case the output values are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . however , the above results on the orbital eccentricity suggest that we could use the asteroseismic density as a prior when fitting the planetary transit : the mean stellar density ( @xmath36 ) yields @xmath29 through kepler s third law ( and assuming @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the orbital period , and @xmath40 the gravitational constant .",
    "the asteroseismic analysis of the stellar p - modes yields a stellar mean density of @xmath41 g/@xmath27 , which results in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for kepler-10b and kepler-10c , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the inclusion of a fixed @xmath44 significantly improves the error bars on the orbital inclination .",
    "the final values are listed in table  [ table : parameters ] .",
    "because of the short period of kepler-10b , we can look at flux variations throughout the entire phase curve for this planet . we calculate this curve in a two - step procedure .",
    "we first de - trend the whole time series by using a moving - median - filtered time series where the length of the filter is set to the planetary period for kepler-10b .",
    "we also calculated de - trended time - series data using filter lengths of two and three times the planetary period for comparison , which revealed no clear dependence on the length of the filter .",
    "the second part of the analysis includes first a phase folding of the time series using the planetary period .",
    "we calculate the median filter in smaller phase bins , using the median value in order to remove extreme data points which could affect the mean values . for kepler-10b , each bin includes about 2000 individual data points .",
    "the final data set we use consists of 603 data points , which means that the mean bin width is 2 minutes , which is two times the temporal sc resolution .",
    "the phase - folded data of the kepler-10b system shows small - scale variations @xmath45 in flux , throughout the entire phase @xmath46 of the planet , as can be seen in figure  [ phase_fit ] .",
    "these variations are due to a combination of reflection plus thermal component from the planet , ellipsoidal distortions of the star , and doppler beaming @xcite . assuming that the planet behaves as a lambertian sphere @xcite , these variations can be described by @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ellipsoidal , beaming and reflective plus thermal emission amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath51 is an arbitrary vertical offset .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 the expected amplitudes for the beaming and ellipsoidal variations are very small .",
    "these amplitudes can be estimated using the analytical models shown in @xcite : @xmath54 using the values for the mass - ratio , @xmath55 , and semi - velocity amplitude , @xmath56 , from @xcite and the values found in table  [ table : parameters ] yields @xmath57 parts per million ( ppm ) and @xmath58  ppm .",
    "the theoretical amplitudes are small and with a mean data scatter of @xmath59  ppm , we do not expect them to be measurable . after confirming that our fitting routine could indeed not constrain those amplitudes , we therefore do not include the beaming and ellipsoidal terms into the final phase model .",
    "therefore , our final fit includes only the reflective plus thermal emission ( lambertian ) component of eq .",
    "[ eq : fit_eq ] , yielding @xmath60 ppm .",
    "all data points outside the transit and occultation are used to determine this amplitude , where the occultation is taken to be centered at mid - phase and of the same duration as the transit .",
    "the flux level of data points inside the occultation can then be measured as well .",
    "when measuring the occultation depth it is necessary to be specific on how exactly this is defined . from the observed phase curve , one may calculate the difference between the flux level at the wings of the phase curve ( just before and after the occultation ) , and the flux level during the occultation .",
    "however , if we use this as the measured occultation depth , the measurement depends on the inclination of the system and more importantly on the distance between the star and the planet ( which determines when the occultation starts and ends , e.g. if the planet is close to the star the occultation will start long before the planet reaches the point of superior conjunction , where the disk is fully illuminated ) . if the inclination is different from 90 degrees , we will find that superior conjunction does not correspond to a fully illuminated disk .",
    "similarly , at inferior conjunction , we will observe a planetary disk that has a tiny illumination at one limb and we are therefore not only measuring the light emitted from the nightside .    in order to provide a physical meaning to the occultation depth , we will use the model presented in eq .",
    "[ eq : fit_eq ] to determine the flux level at superior conjunction , for a planet at an inclination of @xmath61 , and compare this with the measured flux level inside the occultation .",
    "similarly , the nightside flux contribution can be measured by comparing the occultation flux level with the model at inferior conjunction and corrected for the inclination angle and position of superior conjunction ( 0.04 and 0.27 ppm , respectively ) .",
    "the latter two effects correct for the fact that the exoplanet is not fully illuminated .",
    "the effect of using @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be seen on figure  [ phase_difference ] , where the difference between the two phase models is shown . at superior conjunction",
    "the change corresponds to 0.04 ppm , while the change at inferior conjunction is approximately @xmath64 ppm .",
    "this is well within our error bars ; we include it only for the sake of completeness . with these definitions , we measure @xmath65 ppm and @xmath66 ppm .",
    "the fit to the phase curve and the occultation , as well as the residuals , are shown in figure  [ phase_fit ] .",
    "the planetary phase curve and occultation can be used to study kepler-10b s temperature and albedo .",
    "we approximate both star and planet as black bodies and use planck s law to describe the photon flux ( amount of photons measured ) per unit wavelength : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the speed of light , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the planck and boltzmann constants .",
    "the amount of photons emitted at a wavelength @xmath71 is then only dependent on the temperature @xmath72 of the object .",
    "we approximate the stellar temperature ( @xmath73 ) as the spectroscopically determined effective temperature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table  [ table : parameters ] ) .",
    "we integrate the planck function over the _ kepler _",
    "bandpass , using the _ kepler _ instrument response function that is available for download from the _ kepler _ website .",
    "even if a planet might not behave as a black body , its brightness temperature ( @xmath74 ) in the _ kepler _ bandpass can be defined as the temperature of a black body with equivalent flux in the _ kepler _ band .",
    "this temperature can be estimated from the differences in flux @xmath75 that may be present at different parts of the phase curve , assuming that they arise due to the thermal radiation of the planet : @xmath76 this equation can be directly used to measure the night - side temperature of the planet , by comparing the flux at the wings of the transit with the flux level inside the occultation . setting @xmath77 , and using table  [ table : parameters ] , we find @xmath78 k. we caution that the error bars can be misleading as they are highly asymmetric : the measurement of @xmath79 is zero within @xmath80 , and that would imply a zero nightside temperature . however , once a non - zero nightside flux is measured , a high brightness temperature is immediately required to explain this .    following the same strategy ,",
    "the temperature of the planetary dayside can be calculated .",
    "however , here the situation is more complicated : the photon flux from the dayside can be a consequence of thermal radiation , but could also be caused by reflection of stellar flux .",
    "the reflection is measured by the planetary geometric albedo , @xmath81 : @xmath82    eq .",
    "[ eq : reflected_light ] can then be used to understand the planetary dayside .",
    "the flux received from the planetary dayside ( the occultation depth @xmath83 ) can be attributed to a combination of thermal emission ( a function of temperature ) and reflected stellar light ( a function of albedo ) . assuming all day - side flux comes from emission ( @xmath84 )",
    ", a maximum day - side brightness temperature is estimated as @xmath85 k. the other extreme scenario corresponds to pure reflection ( @xmath86 ) ; a maximum albedo @xmath87 is found .",
    "a curve relating temperature and albedo between these two extreme scenarios is plotted in figure  [ fig : temperature_albedo ] .",
    "the observed temperature - albedo measurements can be compared to a theoretical temperature .",
    "the equilibrium temperature ( @xmath88 ) is the temperature of an isothermal planet with no internal heating .",
    "it depends on the amount of radiation it receives from the star , the amount of light reflected and an internal heat redistribution parameter @xmath89 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath90 assuming that the geometric albedo , @xmath81 , is 2/3 of the planetary bond albedo .",
    "the heat redistribution parameter as defined here can range from 1/4 to 2/3 , with the former value representing homogeneous redistribution of incident radiation around the planet such that the night - side temperature equals the day - side and the latter number representing no redistribution , or instant re - radiation .",
    "the true value of @xmath89 presumably lies somewhere between those two scenarios . as before",
    ", we can calculate maximum temperatures for those two scenarios , assuming @xmath84 , and find @xmath91 k and @xmath92 k. the full region of equilibrium temperatures for different redistribution factors and different albedos is shown in figure [ fig : temperature_albedo ] .",
    "we note that the equilibrium temperature is lower than the brightness temperature in all cases .",
    "one explanation for this would be an additional source heating the planet , which we do not take into account ( e.g. internal heating from the planet ) . another explanation is that the excess flux in the _ kepler _ bandpass is caused by a deviation of the planetary spectrum from a black - body spectrum .",
    "interestingly , @xcite analyze phase curves and occultation for eight hot jupiter planets in the _ kepler _ field and find a similar result .",
    "we revisited the analysis of the kepler-10 system , as the amount of data available has significantly increased since the discovery paper .",
    "we derive system parameters ( table [ table : parameters ] ) to an unprecedented accuracy . at this level ,",
    "a word of caution about systematic effects is in order . for the host star ,",
    "the two independent asteroseismic analyses agree within the error bars for all parameters , supporting the accuracy of our final values . at the planetary level ,",
    "the accuracy of order 1% for the relative planetary radius is at the level of expected _ kepler _ systematic effects @xcite .",
    "finally , the planetary phase curve is measured at the part per million level and therefore particularly vulnerable to data systematics or the choice of model .",
    "particular care is needed when interpreting the temperature of the planet s nightside , where even a change at the ppm level can produce a very different temperature and be the difference between detection and non - detection of nightside radiation .",
    "it is interesting that the parameters where our analysis provides the largest improvement ( stellar age , planetary nightside temperature , and planetary dayside temperature plus albedo ) are also those that are potentially the most relevant for models of the evolution and composition of kepler-10b .",
    "we can now conclusively claim that the age of the system is on the order of 10 gyr , with the value determined to a precision better than 15% .",
    "the parameters of the host star are consistent with the earlier analysis of @xcite , telling us that it is possible to get accurate stellar parameters with only a few months of data . however , our analysis drastically reduced the level of uncertainties .    together with the recently discovered kepler-78 @xcite , kepler-10b is the only rocky planet for which a phase curve has been detected .",
    "we analyzed it in much more detail than in the discovery paper @xcite and a subsequent physical model for the surface @xcite , which used the same limited dataset .",
    "our values for @xmath50 and @xmath83 ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) are a significant refinement of the values found by @xcite , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ppm respectively , which were based on about five months of _ kepler _ data .",
    "@xcite , using the same dataset , find a single - parameter model in which phase curve amplitude and occultation depth are equal , and they find a value of @xmath97 ppm . while consistent with these values within @xmath98 , our values are on the high end for both , and determined more accurately .",
    "in addition , our non - zero value for @xmath99 is different from what was used in the lava - ocean model by @xcite , who assess a model where the planet s surface is filled with molten lava , which is not expected to flow over to the nightside ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our apparent non - zero value leads to a high temperature for the planetary nightside .",
    "we note that the measurement of this temperature might depend on the model used for the phase curve .",
    "to check the contribution of the @xmath100 and @xmath99 in the phase model , we estimate both @xmath100 and @xmath99 , by comparing the continuum data surrounding the occultation and primary transit event to the occultation level . for consistency",
    ", the continuum bins consist of the same number of data points as is contained in the occultation event .",
    "this basic method yields values of @xmath101 ppm and @xmath102 ppm .",

    "<S> since the discovery of kepler-10 , the system has received considerable interest because it contains a small , rocky planet which orbits the star in less than a day . </S>",
    "<S> the system s parameters , announced by the _ kepler _ team and subsequently used in further research , were based on only 5 months of data . </S>",
    "<S> we have reanalyzed this system using the full span of 29 months of _ kepler _ photometric data , and obtained improved information about its star and the planets . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the extended time series provides a significant improvement on the stellar parameters : not only can we state that kepler-10 is the oldest known rocky - planet - harboring system at @xmath0 gyr , but these parameters combined with improved planetary parameters from new transit fits gives us the radius of kepler-10b to within just 125 km . </S>",
    "<S> a new analysis of the full planetary phase curve leads to new estimates on the planetary temperature and albedo , which remain degenerate in the _ kepler _ band . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling suggests that the flux level during the occultation is slightly lower than at the transit wings , which would imply that the nightside of this planet has a non - negligible temperature . </S>"
