    "it is well established that various microorganisms , such as bacteria and algae , propel themselves through a suspending medium using a nonreciprocal cyclic motion @xcite . despite the progress that has been made in elucidating the self - propulsion mechanisms of various microorganisms in isolation , an understanding of their collective dynamics",
    "is still elusive .",
    "recent experimental and simulation studies have shown that complicated interactions arising from the microorganisms activity produce diverse nonequilibrium cooperative phenomena , whose behaviors are notably different from those observed in passive systems .",
    "such fascinating aspects of active systems are suggestive of new underlying principles ; the search for these is the current focus of intense study among the soft matter physics community ( see recent reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions ( his ) , and their dynamic coupling to activity , are thought to be among the key elements that govern transport and rheological properties in suspensions of swimming microorganisms ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of microorganisms have been extensively studied and their general features have been well revealed in certain simple situations ; for example , when two microorganisms are far apart compared to their sizes , a weak attractive interaction acts between them .",
    "this is because the dominant contribution is of a dipole - dipole character ( which is attractive for particles that are free to rotate ) .",
    "however , we are still far from a thorough understanding of the role of his in nondilute systems of active particles .",
    "when the distances between microorganisms are comparable to their sizes , his in the near field become important , but the effects of such interactions are not easy to understand in general .",
    "this is because the details of both the swimming mechanisms and the particle shapes come into play with increased proximity ( where not just dipolar terms but higher order multipoles contribute ) , so that the his among microorganisms at moderate or high density are more complicated and less universal than the dilute case .",
    "thus , it is interesting and important to examine many - body his through simulations of minimal microorganism models . from such models it may be possible to extract some generic features of cooperative phenomena in active suspensions of various types .",
    "it is well recognized that , in a wide variety of systems , activity produces marked dynamic interactions , resulting in collective fluctuations or structure formation .",
    "examples include giant number fluctuations @xcite , clustering ( or swarming ) @xcite , and bulk phase separation @xcite .",
    "these phenomena can occur without any direct potential interactions , and therefore have a purely dynamical origin . in systems manifesting such a dynamic cooperativity",
    ", a fundamental question is how his influence or change the activity - induced interactions .",
    "although certain collective effects characteristic of active systems are believed to be greatly influenced by his , there is still no general consensus on their roles in such phenomena . indeed , for the reasons given above",
    ", this can depend on particle shape and/or swimming mechanism so that such questions must be asked within the context of well defined models .",
    "one popular model is that of squirmers : spherical particles with a prescribed surface velocity field @xcite . for squirmers in two dimensions",
    "it was found that the phase separation , otherwise caused by a collisional reduction in mean propulsion speed of swimmers at high density @xcite , is switched off by his @xcite .",
    "another popular model is based on dumbbell shaped swimmers subject to a set of discrete forces acting on the two solid particles and on the fluid @xcite . as we explain further below",
    ", this model may need to be supplemented by an _",
    "ad hoc _ rule to govern the case where a second swimmer is about to occupy the spatial position at which the active force from a first swimmer acts on the fluid . even with such a rule , the model seems a better starting point than squirmers when modeling suspensions of rod - like motile bacteria .",
    "specifically , squirmers can only exert active torques on each other , whereas rod - like swimmers can exert both active and passive torques .",
    "note that torques are particularly important in active systems ( e.g. @xcite ) since they rotate not just the particle , but also its swimming direction .    in this study , to further understand the role of his in collective dynamics for nonspherical swimmers , we numerically investigate the dynamics of non - dilute active suspensions of self - propelled dumbbells in three dimensions .",
    "we especially focus on activity - induced clustering at modest concentrations @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as a precursor to activity - induced phase separation .",
    "however we do not address full phase separation , which can only be simulated accurately with enormous system sizes @xcite , such that a study of the role of near - field his in active phase separation remains out of reach with current computers .",
    "( some far - field effects might instead be represented within a continuum model @xcite . )",
    "our simulation method fully takes into account the solvent dynamics and thus is suitable for the investigation of his , as will be explained in the next section . in sec .",
    "iii , we demonstrate that the activity - induced his can strongly alter both the translational and rotational dynamics at modest densities . at a relatively small volume fraction",
    ", an activity - induced hydrodynamic attraction dominates the collective dynamics of the swimmers , resulting in a stronger slowing down , and hence enhanced clustering , compared to the case without his .",
    "the volume fraction dependence of the motility is found to be much stronger with his than without them ; this also influences the clustering tendency , as we discuss in sec .",
    "iv . section v gives our conclusions and a further discussion .",
    "many - body hydrodynamic interactions in semidilute regimes are difficult to deal with even using simulations because of their intrinsically long - range and time - dependent character ; in principle we must solve the navier - stokes equation with moving boundary conditions at the solvent - particle interfaces . to confront these difficulties , in the past decade , several hybrid simulation techniques @xcite as well as other mesoscopic methods @xcite for the dynamics of complex colloidal suspensions have been developed . of these methods ,",
    "we here adopt the fluid - particle - dynamics ( fpd ) method @xcite to incorporate his into the study of a model active suspension .    within the framework of the fpd method ,",
    "his can be approximately taken into account ( i ) by treating a rigid colloidal particle as a nondeformable but highly viscous fluid particle , and ( ii ) by replacing the particle - fluid boundary with a smoothed boundary .",
    "this simple scheme considerably reduces the numerical cost and the mathematical complexity of the computation even while preserving the basic nature of his in many - body colloidal systems .",
    "the validity of this method has been examined by several authors @xcite .",
    "it is good at capturing both far - field and intermediate - field aspects of the his , though like many other methods it can not ( at reasonable computational cost ) also resolve the divergence of lubrication forces that occurs when hard suspended particles come into very close contact @xcite .",
    "in practice the model can be considered to describe colloids whose hard - core radius ( set by the interparticle pair potential ) slightly exceeds their hydrodynamic radius , so that thin lubrication films never dominate .       and a  phantom \" spherical particle with radius @xmath0 .",
    "the center - to - center distance between the head and tail particles and that between the phantom and tail particles are fixed at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . the back - to - back ( a ) and face - to - face ( b ) force configurations correspond respectively to the pusher ( extensile ) and puller ( contractile ) swimming mechanisms .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.5% ]    our model of a swimming microorganism comprises a dumbbell with a prescribed dipolar force pair , which is essentially the same as the models used in refs .",
    "@xcite and later in ref .",
    "each dumbbell is composed of two real particles plus one  phantom \" particle  so called because ( a ) it merely follows the motion of the pair of real particles to which it is attached and ( b ) it can overlap with the other real particles in nearby swimmers",
    ". the phantom particle can be thought of as modeling the effect of a thin flagellar bundle , whereby a force is exerted on the fluid at a position displaced from the rod - like bacterial body ( represented by the dimer of real particles ) .",
    "the positions @xmath3 and the radii @xmath4 of the particles and the distances of separation between them determine the shape of the swimmer , where the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the head and tail particles of the dumbbell , respectively , and @xmath7 denotes the phantom particle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the swimmer s orientation is characterized by a unit vector @xmath8 .",
    "the propulsion force @xmath9 is exerted on the fluid via the phantom particle ; an equal and opposite force @xmath10 is exerted on the tail particle , which ensures the dipolar character of the swimming mechanism .",
    "hence there is no net external force on a box of fluid that fully encloses the swimmer .",
    "face - to - face ( @xmath11 ) and back - to - back ( @xmath12 ) force configurations correspond to  pusher \" ( extensile ) and  puller \" ( contractile ) microorganisms respectively ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "although , in this paper , we limit our study to the dynamics of pushers such as motile bacteria , it would be straightforward to perform a corresponding simulation for pullers of the same geometry .",
    "a similar dumbbell model , and its hydrodynamic instabilities , were theoretically investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite by analyzing hydrodynamic equations derived by a coarse - graining approach .",
    "it is one of several models , used to address active suspensions , in which surface stresses or force configurations are prescribed @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to specify a surface slip velocity , which is usually done for spherical particles resulting in the squirmer model mentioned previously @xcite .",
    "recently , several groups have investigated many - body his in squirmer suspensions @xcite .",
    "although both force - prescribed ( rodlike ) and velocity - prescribed ( spherical ) particles exhibit some similar effects , such as an enhancement of the particle diffusion , their differences in shapes and swimming mechanisms may cause important changes in the transport properties @xcite .",
    "for example , these models show distinct flow responses , largely owing to the difference in the shapes , resulting in different rheological properties @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic difference in the models can cause strong variations in the nature of near - field his as well as in the interparticle torques at close approach , both of which will alter cooperative behaviors at finite density .",
    "we will draw attention to these differences occasionally in what follows , in relation to recent simulations of squirmers @xcite .",

    "the phantom particle ( @xmath7 ) does not alter the local viscosity .",

    "the rigidity of the real particles is approximately sustained by the large viscosity difference , @xmath21 .",
    "with @xmath22 obeying eq.([viscosity ] ) , fpd describes the dynamics by simply solving the usual navier - stokes equation for the velocity field : @xmath23 + { \\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}}_{\\rm rev}+ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}}_{\\rm act } ,   \\label{navier - stokes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the viscous stress tensor , @xmath25 is the pressure , and @xmath26 is the unit tensor .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure @xmath25 is determined by the incompressibility condition @xmath27 in ( [ navier - stokes ] ) , @xmath28 is the random stress tensor which , in three dimensions , satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relation as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the temperature in units of the boltzmann constant . in ( [ navier - stokes ] ) , @xmath31 is the ( volumetric ) reversible force density arising from the direct interaction potential between the real particles . with the total potential energy @xmath32 ,",

    ", we must introduce suitable dynamical rules for the phantom particles .",
    "we assume that such a particle merely follows the motion of the dimer of real particles to which it is attached .",
    "in other words , the position @xmath43 obeys @xmath44 where @xmath2 is the constant center - to - center distance between the tail and phantom particles .",
    "we assume that there is no interaction between the phantom particles which therefore can overlap each other . on the other hand , an overlap between the real and phantom particles leads to an unphysical effect : in our model , the real particle is regarded as a rigid particle , and the volumetric force acting on the rigid particle is treated as a homogeneous force density . however , any penetration of the phantom particle into the real particle results in an inhomogeneity of the force density within the rigid particle region , creating a contradiction between the required dynamics and the precepts of the fpd numerical scheme .",
    "there are at least two possible ways to avoid any such effect @xcite .",
    "the first one is to introduce an additional dynamical rule , by which the active force is switched off , when the phantom particle of one swimmer overlaps on the body part of the other .",
    "the second one is to introduce additional repulsive interactions involving the phantom particles , which directly prevent such overlaps without losing the propulsive force ( thus , in this case , the `` phantom '' particle is not exactly a phantom ) . in this study",
    ", we mainly investigate the first of these models , but the second will be discussed in the appendix with some simulation results presented there for comparison .",
    "we find that in the present dumbbell model , the qualitative picture regarding the role of hydrodynamic interactions is relatively insensitive to such model details ( although they do alter the quantitative results ) : the nonlocal and long - range nature of his allows them to dominate some important aspects of the collective dynamics .    here",
    ", we detail the dynamical rule employed in the main text : when @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the @xmath48-th swimmer becomes passive .",
    "that is , if a swimmer s phantom particle overlaps with the real - particle ` body ' of another swimmer , the propulsive force pair attached to the first swimmer becomes switched off until its phantom particle once again lies in a purely fluid region .",
    "although somewhat _ ad hoc _ , this dynamical rule could reflect a physical situation in which the motility of a bacterium is weakened if its flagellar bundle encounters the body of a second bacterial body .",
    "this behavior ( a slowing of propulsion in the neighborhood of other particles ) will cause an effective attraction between swimming particles @xcite and will therefore promote clustering .",
    "however , such an effective attraction is already present , even for dynamical rules in which the propulsive force is maintained throughout a collision , since the hard - core repulsions still cause swimming particles to slow down at high densities .",
    "the effects of the rule- and collision - induced slowing are both relevant for the clustering as shown in sec .",
    "iii c. the important aspect for our study is not the local details of our overlap rule but the fact that , at all times , momentum conservation is still satisfied .",

    "this is not the case for a passive dumbbell subject to an external force : there , because of the front - back symmetry of the streamlines , the viscous drag forces acting on the head and tail particles are then the same .",
    "the hydrodynamic pair interactions of swimmers have been extensively studied by many authors in several dumbbell models @xcite and in squirmers @xcite .",

[ fig3](d ) .",
    "for a symmetric dumbbell swimmer @xcite , for which the streamlines exhibit front - back symmetry , the hydrodynamic attraction acts equally on both the head and tail particles in the situation considered here .",
    "the repulsion we observe is caused by the front - back asymmetry of the streamlines ; the hydrodynamic attraction acting on the tail particle is stronger than that on the head particle , and this imbalance results in a torque , causing outward rotation of the swimming direction .",
    "for @xmath110 the characteristic rotation time of the swimmer can be estimated using the usual stokeslet point - force approximation as follows : here , we suppose that the two swimmers are placed in the @xmath111 plane and swim in parallel in the @xmath96 direction .",

    "[ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](c ) .",
    "this happens for two reasons .",
    "first , near - field hydrodynamic interactions generically prevent two nearly contacting tail or head particles from changing their separations : this `` squeeze - film '' lubrication drag becomes stronger for smaller @xmath127 .",
    "this results in slower rotations , and hence a slower onset of the resulting repulsions .",
    "second , once the tail particles closely approach one another , their direct interparticle repulsion itself prevents further motion . because of these two effects ,",
    "when two initially parallel swimmers lie very close to one another , their rotational velocity becomes much smaller than the far - field estimate . as a result",
    "they stay close to each other for a time much larger than @xmath124 .",
    "suppose that at @xmath86 two swimmers lie anti parallel in a staggered coplanar configuration ; the active forces are now suddenly applied .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a ) shows the trajectories of the head and tail particles of two such swimmers for several different initial positions . at a large enough separation ( @xmath122 ) , the two swimmers pass by each other without a strong distortion of their trajectories .",
    "however , with decreasing @xmath127 , the his drastically influence their mutual dynamics .",
    "when the two swimmers are approaching , they initially repel each other , because the repulsive his act on them .",
    "then , when they are passing each other , the head particle of one swimmer is strongly attracted to the streamline induced by the other swimmer , which is also evident in the behavior of the swimming speed shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . therefore at small @xmath127 , the speed of the swimmer first reduces and then accelerates . a snapshot of the swimmers at @xmath125 is shown in fig .  [ fig4](c ) .",
    "similarly to the analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ stokeslet ] , by using the far - field stokeslet point - force approximation , for @xmath122 , we can roughly estimate the rotation rate as @xmath129 .",

    "then , at closer distances , these repulsive effects are suppressed ; hydrodynamic forces promote preferred structures , in which the swimmers are close to parallel alignment ( or , with our overlap rule , antiparallel ) .",
    "these states can last much longer than the intrinsic characteristic time for an encounter , @xmath225 .",
    "our simulation results strongly suggest that such activity - induced his should be significant at rather smaller volume fraction ( @xmath226 ) , where they cause strong enhancement of a clustering tendency that is already apparent , albeit in a weaker form and by a different mechanism , when his are absent .",

    "the translational swimming motion becomes slower , while rotational diffusion becomes faster ; these are natural consequences of the far - field and intermediate - range pair interactions just described , and are stronger than the corresponding effects without his . on the other hand , at large enough volume fractions ,",
    "the translational and rotational motions are both strongly suppressed . with crowding , because less space is available around a swimmer , the ability of each force dipole to set up a coherent propulsive flow field is diminished , weakening both the motility and the his . however , due to the incompressible nature of his , neighboring swimmers push and pull each other around even without direct contact .",
    "this impedes both the translational and rotational motions much more than is the case without his , where only direct collisional forces act between the swimmers .",
    "the different volume fraction dependences of the motility with and without his influence the tendency to form clusters . for our chosen interaction and propulsion parameters , clustering is maximal at an intermediate volume fraction in each case , but this volume fraction is lower , and clustering stronger , with his than without .",
    "the conditions under which bulk phase separation arises , rather than just enhanced density fluctuations , remain somewhat unclear ; in particular steric or other interactions at volume fractions above @xmath218 ( with his ) or @xmath227 ( without ) apparently suppress phase separation under conditions where the observed dependence of the mean swim speed @xmath228 on @xmath190 might lead one to expect it @xcite .",
    "such corrections to the theory have also been reported for spherical self - propelled particles @xcite , but not at such low densities .    in considering the effects of his on collective dynamics , we note in addition important differences between alternative types of models . in a recent simulation of two - dimensional squirming disks @xcite",
    ", it was found that the activity - induced phase separation is strongly suppressed by his . in that system , because the slip velocity is prescribed at their surfaces , when two squirmers come very close , they generally tend to strongly rotate and repel .",
    "thus , crowding enhances the reorientation of the swimmers and reduces their tendency to trap one another .",
    "in contrast , in our model of force - prescribed dumbbells , although the reorientation is enhanced at low enough volume fractions , at higher ones both the translational and rotational motions become much slower than without his . moreover , at a certain intermediate volume fraction , the hydrodynamic trapping effect ( and indeed the clustering ) is most pronounced .",
    "further simulation studies and analysis will be required to clarify the detailed conditions for phase separation with and without his in our dumbbell model .    in previous works by graham and co - workers @xcite , it was found that , in suspensions of force - prescribed dumbbell pushers , his among them cause coherent fluid motions with a correlation length larger than the swimmer size .",
    "interestingly , such correlated motions are hardly seen in suspensions of pullers .",
    "saintillan and shelley @xcite reported similar results by simulating a similar model , where the active particle is modeled as a stress - prescribed rigid rod .",
    "furthermore , they also found that an isotropic or aligned homogeneous state becomes unstable due to his and some non - linear hydrodynamic effects lead to steady - state structure with a pronounced density inhomogeneity and local orientational order of swimmers @xcite .",
    "although these previous studies do not contradict our simulations , we found that , at certain intermediate densities , the clustering caused by activity - induced attractions ( or hydrodynamic trapping ) is greater than previously reported , which , as already discussed , can be attributed to the effects of near - field his .",
    "the advantage of the hybrid simulation methods such as that used in the present study is that , by directly taking the solvent dynamics into account , we can accurately treat his among finite - sized particles at moderate separations , and also capture some significant near - field effects . in the previous studies , on the other hand , active particles are essentially represented as pairs of point forces and his",

    "our finding that his have significant effects on clustering physics is far from obvious ; due to the dipole - dipole nature of these interactions among self - propelled particles , they are much weaker than for particles subjected to external forces , and under many conditions their effects appear almost negligible @xcite .",
    "certainly one can argue that for situations where the main interaction between particles involves well - separated two - body collisions , the effects of his are indeed relatively weak ; however this argument is dangerous when applied to the many - body collective behavior of swimmers at the fairly high densities actually arising within clusters .",

    "iv .     at @xmath189 .",
    "the red and green curves are for the cases with and without his , respectively .",
    "these curves exhibit similar behaviors to those with the dynamical rule shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] but with an overall shift to higher @xmath190 ( due to the absence of the rule - induced slowing down ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig13](a ) and [ fig13](b ) , we plot the dependence on the volume fraction @xmath190 of the average swimspeed , @xmath194 , and the rotational relaxation time , @xmath197 , respectively . similarly to the result shown in sec .",
    "iv [ fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) ] , with his , @xmath194 exhibits a much faster decay than that without his .",
    "the rotational relaxation also exhibits a similar behavior to that shown in fig.[fig10](b ) .",
    "these observed differences in the ( mean ) motility for systems with and without his can be again attributed to the long - range and cooperative natures of his ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "iv ) . notice that the reduction of @xmath197 at lower @xmath190 is more significant than that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) .",
    "this may be because of both the addition of the repulsions and the removal of the dynamical rule , which enhance the collision - induced transfer of the angular momentum .      as is discussed in sec .",
    "iv , these differences in the volume fraction dependence of the motility with and without his should affect the clustering behavior . in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , we show the structure factor for various @xmath190 with and without his . without his ,",
    "the weak clustering occurs at smaller volume fraction ( @xmath209 ) but is highly suppressed at higher @xmath190 . from the data of @xmath194 , the condition @xmath211 holds for @xmath251 , so that according to the theory @xcite , the effective compressibility is expected to be negative , leading to the instability of the homogeneous state . however , as noticed in sec .",
    "iv , for the present dumbbell system , at such relatively large volume fractions , direct repulsions ( which are omitted in the theory ) give a dominant contribution to the compressibility ( or pressure ) .",
    "this stabilizes the homogeneous state .",
    "although the structure factor is found to grow significantly on increasing the magnitude of the active force , further numerical investigations are necessary to clarify the detailed conditions for bulk phase separation , which remain the subject of a future study .",
    "on the other hand , with his , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig14](a ) , the clustering becomes enhanced with increasing @xmath190 .",
    "the fitting of @xmath194 represented in fig .",
    "[ fig13](a ) suggests that the spinodal condition @xmath211 of refs .",
    "@xcite is satisfied for @xmath252 .",
    "notice that the clustering tendency at relatively larger volume fractions is much more enhanced than that exhibited by the model with the switch - off rule [ for comparison , see fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) ] . in the model",
    "used here , the active forces of the swimmers are not reduced at close proximity , and therefore the activity - induced hydrodynamic attractions are strong enough to overcome repulsive interactions even for larger @xmath190 .    in this appendix , by performing an analysis similar to that in sec .",
    "iv , we have explored the clustering behavior of the dumbbell model with a different treatment of the phantom particle . without his , some marked differences arise between the two treatments ; that is , the collective behaviors are strongly dependent on the local rules or interactions . on the other hand , because the long - range and non - local natures of his govern the collective dynamics , the global picture regarding the hydrodynamic effects is not much altered .",
    "this robustness to the local interaction rules is an important result of the present study .",
    "the above simulation results , along with those shown in sec .",
    "iv , show that theory can qualitatively explain the characteristic features of the effective attraction caused by the density dependent motility , although there are some discrepancies between the theory @xcite and the present simulation , especially at higher volume fractions , where some effects omitted from the theory ( for example , steric repulsions due to the excluded volume ) can come to dominate .",
    "although the effects of long - range his are largely separable from near - field and collisional effects , the latter are separately important , at least at the quantitative level . here",
    "one expects strong dependencies both on particle shape and on whether the propulsion is described by a force - prescribed or a velocity - prescribed mechanism .                                                                                                              in the original works in refs .",
    "@xcite , a microorganism is represented as a set of point forces .",
    "however , in the simulation of the continuum model using a discrete lattice , a force should be given through a prescribed spatial distribution with a finite width , which must be larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "the factor , @xmath253 , arises from the definition of the particle velocity [ eq .",
    "( [ particle_velocity ] ) ] . in the brownian simulations , the active force",
    "is multiplied by this factor to match the swim - speed of an isolated swimmer with and without his .",
    "for instance ,",
    "smooth - swimming _ e. coli _ mutants have a swim speed of around @xmath257ms@xmath258 , a length @xmath259 m , and thermal rotation time of a few seconds .",
    "see v. a. martinez , r. besseling , o. a. croze , j. tailleur , m. reufer , j. schwarz - linek , l. g. wilson .",

    "similar hydrodynamic instabilities were also theoretically argued by baskaran and marchetti @xcite .",
    "however , in their study , the growth of density fluctuations is predicted to occur for pullers , but it does not for pushers , which is different from the present results .",
