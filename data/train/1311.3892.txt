    "experimental demonstrations of raman - induced spin - orbit coupling in cold atoms have motivated theoretical proposals for using these techniques to observe topological edge modes @xcite .",
    "a practical concern with these proposals is that the raman process introduces an intrinsic heating mechanism . as discussed by wei and mueller @xcite",
    ", this heating is particularly problematic for @xmath0 , one of the work - horse fermions used in cold atom experiments .",
    "here we show how to exploit the rich hyperfine structure of alkali atoms to ameliorate this heating .",
    "excitement about raman - induced spin - orbit coupling in cold atoms is related to broader interest in  topological \" states of matter , i.e. , those which are characterized by topological invariants which lead to non - trivial edge modes .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is an essential ingredient in many electronic topological states @xcite , and these raman experiments promise to enable cold - atom studies of analogous physics .",
    "a particularly natural setup would involve a gas of fermionic atoms in a quasi-1d `` wire - trap '' .",
    "a magnetic - field induced feshbach resonance could drive the atoms into a paired superfluid state . adding spin - orbit coupling would lead to majorana edge modes @xcite .",
    "the same photons which provide spin - orbit coupling also heat the cloud . here",
    "we propose minimizing this heating by dividing our atoms into two populations , distinguished by their hyperfine spins .",
    "both the feshbach resonant interactions and the raman couplings are state selective , and one of these populations can be chosen to be strongly interacting , yet feel no spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the other will be essentially non - interacting , but experience a substantial spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the raman lasers will produce heat , but the heating rate will be proportional to the number of atoms in the raman - coupled states . by making the superfluid population large compared to the raman - coupled population , one can make studying this system practical",
    ".    figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the hyperfine level diagram of @xmath0 , and the states we propose using for this experiment .",
    "the strongly interacting population ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) will be formed from the lowest and second lowest hyperfine states .",
    "these states have a feshbach resonance at @xmath3 in 3d @xcite .",
    "the superfluid formed by these states has been observed @xcite .",
    "the raman - coupled population ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) will be formed from the third and fourth lowest hyperfine states .",

    "interconversion between @xmath2 and @xmath4 can be driven by radio waves .",
    "microwaves can independently drive the @xmath1 to @xmath5 transition . by appropriately detuning these transitions , one can set the relative equilibrium populations of each of the states . in the presence of such interconversion",

    "the r - atoms have no readily accessible feshbach resonances , and the raman coupling strengths for the s - atoms are 40 times smaller than those of the r - atoms ( when the intensity is adjusted to give the same inelastic scattering rates ) .",
    "furthermore , our approach provides a nice analogy to the solid state experiments , where the superconductivity and the spin - orbit coupling comes from separate materials .",
    "it is natural to ask if similar physics could be seen in higher dimension .",
