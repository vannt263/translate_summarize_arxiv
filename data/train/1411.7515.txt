    "many frustrated magnetic compounds with strong quantum fluctuations have been synthesized and measured during last years .",
    "a challenging target is to provide a theoretical description of the observable properties .",
    "an important class of frustrated quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets , for which the properties can be described in great detail in the low - temperature strong - field regime , is the class of the so - called localized - magnon systems.@xcite these localized - magnon systems have a completely dispersionless ( flat ) lowest - energy one - magnon band that offers the possibility to consider one - magnon states which are localized within a small part of the lattice ( trap ) . as a result ,",
    "many - magnon ground states can be constructed , their degeneracy can be calculated with the help of an auxiliary classical lattice - gas model , and the low - temperature strong - field thermodynamics of the quantum systems at hand can be elaborated using the methods of classical statistical mechanics.@xcite    from the aspect of solid - state physics , it is important to notice the following .",
    "the lowest - energy magnon band is strictly flat only for special relations between exchange couplings that corresponds to one particular point in the parameter space .",
    "one can not expect that a real - life system would reach exactly this flat - band point .",
    "however , a certain magnetic compound may be quite close to it .",
    "a fascinating example is the natural mineral azurite cu@xmath4(co@xmath4)@xmath5(oh)@xmath5,@xcite which is known as a realization of the frustrated diamond spin chain close to the flat - band point.@xcite in our recent study@xcite we have considered three localized - magnon systems ( the diamond and dimer - plaquette chains and the two - dimensional square - kagome lattice ) which belong to the monomer universality class@xcite with small deviations from the ideal flat - band geometry and have elaborated effective low - energy theories which provide good description of the initial frustrated quantum isotropic ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) heisenberg antiferromagnets in the low - temperature strong - field regime .    in the present paper",
    "we make one step further and consider an anisotropic @xmath0 heisenberg ( antiferromagnetic ) interaction to examine the dependence of some observables at low temperatures on the orientation of the applied ( strong ) magnetic field .",
    "note that for the isotropic @xmath6 heisenberg interaction the orientation of the applied magnetic field is irrelevant .    from the experimental point of view , we know that the low - temperature magnetization curves for azurite with the field applied along chain direction and perpendicularly to chain direction are different@xcite that indicates an anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "even stronger anisotropy effects have been recently observed for the spin dimer magnet ba@xmath5cosi@xmath5o@xmath7cl@xmath5  a recently synthesized compound which should also exhibit localized - magnon physics.@xcite in this compound the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the co@xmath8 spin-1/2 ions are @xmath3-like and the exchange - interaction network of the co@xmath8 sites is described by a frustrated bilayer lattice.@xcite    in what follows we investigate the frustrated diamond - chain lattice as a paradigmatic system to study localized - magnon effects . while the case of the @xmath1-aligned magnetic field does not require a new framework for getting effective models in comparison with the previously reported scheme,@xcite the case of a magnetic field aligned in @xmath2 or @xmath9 direction is different , since the zeeman term does not commute with the anisotropic @xmath0 hamiltonian any more .",
    "we consider a field aligned along the @xmath2-axis ( trivially , for symmetry reasons a @xmath9-aligned field leads to the same results ) .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the experimental data for ba@xmath5cosi@xmath5o@xmath7cl@xmath5 we focus on antiferromagnetic @xmath0 interactions with easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "to obtain effective hamiltonians we use the strong - coupling approach.@xcite after deriving the effective hamiltonians we test their quality by comparisons to exact - diagonalization data . using exact results for the effective models we can provide theoretical predictions for the low - temperature magnetization curves in @xmath1- or @xmath2-aligned ( strong ) magnetic field as well as for other thermodynamic quantities in this regime in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "there are some common features of this approach valid for both cases .",
    "first we use as a starting point a collection of @xmath12 vertical dimers ( @xmath17 bonds ) and the @xmath25 isolated sites labeled by @xmath26 ( see fig .",

    "however , the magnetization jump for the diamond chain survives as a prominent feature of localized - magnon systems .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a state which contains local singlets ( [ 05 ] ) on vertical bonds remains an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ 03 ] ) even for @xmath113 .",

    "the most prominent effect of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction @xmath50 is the shift of the steep increase ( jump for ideal geometry , jump - like for nonideal geometry ) of the magnetization @xmath64 to saturation ( or to nearly saturation ) towards lower values of magnetic field [ see also eqs .",
