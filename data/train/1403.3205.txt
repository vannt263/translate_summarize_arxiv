    "the knowledge about the interaction at low energies is of fundamental importance due , in part , to diversities of the -cluster phenomena in nuclear physics , where one has to deal with configurations of two or more -particles interacting with each other .",
    "thanks to the robust , tightly bound structure of the ( spin- and isospin zero ) @xmath0he nucleus , the elastic scattering cross section has been measured quite accurately during the sixties and seventies of the last century , and numerous phase - shift analyses were made based on these cross sections @xcite .",
    "the key quantity in an optical model ( om ) study of elastic scattering is the optical potential ( op ) that has been treated either phenomenologically @xcite or evaluated microscopically from the ( two - body ) nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction between nucleons bound in the two interacting -particles @xcite . in terms of the quantum mechanical treatment of elastic scattering , the resonating group method ( rgm ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) is the most rigorous approach that takes into account the full antisymmetrization of the total wave function of the scattering system .",

    "density independent _ nn interaction in the gaussian form could be used as the effective interaction in the rgm calculation .",
    "the pauli blocking effects have also been studied rigorously in the fish - bone model for the potential @xcite . in a somewhat less rigorous way , the double - folding model ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "an accurate local approximation for the exchange potential has been developed @xcite , which allowed the use of some realistic density dependent nn interaction . among different choices of the effective nn interaction , the original density independent m3y interactions",
    "@xcite have been used with some success in the double - folding calculations of the heavy - ion ( hi ) optical potential at low energies @xcite , where the data are sensitive only to the potential at the surface because of the strong absorption . however , in cases of refractive ( rainbow )  scattering where the elastic data are sensitive to the op over a much wider radial range , the density independent m3y interactions failed to give a good description of the data and the inclusion of an explicit density dependence was found necessary @xcite to account for the reduction of the attractive strength of the in - medium nn interaction that occurs as the density of the nuclear medium increases .",
    "such an effect has been shown to be due to the saturation properties of nuclear matter and some realistic density dependent versions of the m3y interaction @xcite have been introduced and used successfully in the folding model analysis of the elastic scattering ( see the recent review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and it is natural to expect the same success of this density dependent interaction in the study of the elastic scattering .",
    "the actual double - folding calculation has shown , however , that only the original density independent m3y interaction can give a reasonable description of the elastic scattering at low energies @xcite .",
    "such an inconsistency of the double - folding model has also been noted earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rainbow scattering data implied the inclusion of a realistic density dependence into the m3y interaction , while the elastic scattering data preferred the original density independent m3y interaction .",
    "in contrast to hi scattering , the elastic scattering data at energies below the reaction threshold of 34.7 mev ( in the lab system ) can be well described by the real op only @xcite , neglecting the imaginary ( absorptive ) part of the op . without the absorption ,",
    "the elastic data measured accurately over the whole observable angular range should be sensitive to the real op down to small radii where the density dependent effects should be substantial due to a high overlap density .",
    "thus , the success of the density independent m3y interaction in the description of the considered data indicates likely to a strong depletion of the overlap density that suppresses the density dependent effects on the shape and depth of the potential .    to shed more light on the applicability of the double - folding model in the study of the scattering at low energies , we have performed in the present work a detailed folding model analysis of the available elastic data at energies below the reaction threshold .",
    "the effects of the density dependence of the nn interaction to the  potential were studied carefully , based on different assumptions for the overlap density .",
    "our microscopic study of the elastic scattering is based on the double - folding model ( dfm ) @xcite , which calculates the real op of the system using the ground state density of @xmath0he nucleus and an appropriate choice of the effective nn interaction .",

    "this -density has a rms radius of 1.461 fm , close to the empirical value of @xmath6 fm that can be deduced from the experimental charge density of @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the gaussian density is readily obtained in a simple 4-nucleon model for the -particle , where 4 nucleons occupy the lowest s@xmath7 harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) shell @xcite .",
    "after the spurious center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "@xcite , the -density remains in a gaussian form but with a modified h.o .",
    "range @xmath8 @xmath9 therefore , if one assumes @xmath10 fm in the -density after the c.m .",
    "correction then it turns out to be the same gaussian as that suggested by satchler and love @xcite , which has been used so far in most of the folding calculations of the and potentials @xcite . in the present work we have compared in some cases the results obtained with the gaussian density ( [ e1a ] ) with those obtained with the experimental -density ( twice the experimental @xmath0he charge density @xcite unfolded with the finite size of proton ) .",
    "a popular choice of the effective nn interaction for the dfm calculation has been one of the m3y interactions that were designed to reproduce the g - matrix elements of the reid @xcite and paris @xcite nn potentials in an oscillator basis .",
    "although the original density independent m3y interaction has been used with some success to calculate the real hi optical potential at low energies , where the scattering data are sensitive to the real op only at the surface @xcite , it failed to account for the nuclear ` rainbow ' scattering ( observed first in the elastic scattering and later on in some light heavy - ion systems @xcite ) , when the scattering data are sensitive to the real op over a wider radial range .",

    "therefore , the use of a _ density dependent _ nn interaction in the folding calculation of the potential should be necessary .",
    "it should be noted that the bdm3y1 and cdm3y6 density dependences have been tailored in the hf calculation for a uniform nuclear matter that can be represented by a single fermi sphere in the momentum space .",
    "the situation in a collision is much more complicated , and the momentum distribution of the dinuclear system is a dynamic picture of two fermi spheres separated by the local relative nucleon momentum . from the nuclear matter point of view",
