    "delay or disruption tolerant networks ( dtns ) are characterized by long delays and intermittent connectivity . moreover",
    ", they may have power constraints , low and asymmetric bandwidth , and high bit - error rates @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . to illustrate some of these characteristics , consider forming a network using the vehicles of figure [ fig1111 ] .",
    "all vehicles , e.g. , buses and cars , are equipped with a radio transceiver , which allows them to communicate with each other , and also to access points , which have connectivity to the internet and are planted strategically in different parts of the city . in this network , all vehicles will help each other forward messages to each other and also to access points .",
    "given the limited transmission range , the intermittent connectivity of vehicles and location of access points , messages will experience significant delays .",
    "another key characteristic is the so called _ store - carry - forward _ model used to propagate messages .",
    "that is , a vehicle may have to store and carry a message for some distance before encountering and passing the message onto another vehicle or access point . in this",
    "regards , a key mobility pattern that can be exploited by routing protocols is the predictable mobility pattern and schedule of buses .",
    "in addition , any routing protocols will have to consider the link capacity and duration of each connection , which is governed by channel condition and vehicle speed .",
    "we can also form a dtn using people .",
    "this can be easily realized given the ubiquity of smart phones equipped with a plethora of sensors and transceivers .",
    "hence , they can be used to monitor traffic , crowd , air pollution and spread of diseases to name a few .",
    "unlike vehicle based dtns , smart devices have resource constraints ; e.g. , limited battery life . moreover , people will have varying contact duration and frequency . that is",
    ", their movement pattern will be less predictable than vehicles .",
    "consider user - a in figure [ fig1111 ] who wants to send a file to one or more students attending the university of wollongong ( uow )",
    ". also shown is a possible transmission path , which depends on encounters with other users of the dtn .",
    "inevitably , the resulting topology or path taken will be random in nature and changes with space and time .",
    "more specifically , it is difficult to predict as it depends on the mobility patterns of people .",
    "interestingly , the authors of @xcite showed that nodes / students who are attending the university of cambridge are not always connected , and hence they experience large delays between meetings .",
    "for example , nodes / students may connect during a class , and disconnect when the class finishes .",
    "the next class may be eight hours away .",
    "secondly , the movement of nodes and encounter duration are random . for instance",
    ", two good friends may remain in contact for a lot longer as compared to other students .",
    "thirdly , nodes exhibit a mobility pattern that coincides with meeting times , e.g. , lectures , and path to a given classroom .    as we can see from table [ tbl1 ] , researchers have proposed various dtns and applications .",
    "for example , in zebranet @xcite , zebras have custom sensors that track their movement patterns and locations . a device carried by a person or a mobile base station",
    "is then used to collect the said tracking data . as mobile base stations have limited communication range , zebras exchange information with other zebras until they encounter a mobile base station .",
    "given that zebras and a mobile station rendezvous randomly , i.e. , they may not meet each other for days or weeks , tracking data incurs significant delays before scientists are able to collect them .",
    "moreover , as the movements of zebras are unpredictable , links are established intermittently and hence there are no end - to - end paths from zebras to mobile base stations .",
    "in addition , zebranet also has storage , bandwidth and energy constraints .",
    "specifically , the sensors on each zebra have a lifetime of only one month , are equipped with a 1 mb flash random access memory ( ram ) and have a data transmission rate ranging from 2.4 to 19.2 kilobits per seconds .",
    "another wildlife example is swim @xcite , where a sensor network is used to monitor whales .",
    "swim combines two kinds of nodes : ( i ) sensors , and ( ii ) infostations .",
    "the sensors are attached to whales , and the infostations are used to collect data from passing whales . in @xcite ,",
    "sensors networks are used to monitor water pollution and noise level in urban areas .",
    "there are also a number of applications that involve special nodes .",
    "for example , daknet @xcite uses vehicles or data ferries to provide low - cost data delivery between rural villages . in each village , a kiosk is used by villagers to store messages and send data to visiting data ferries , which then uploads the data they have collected onto the internet . as data is carried by data ferries , it experiences a much higher delay than conventional networks . to clarify ,",
    "the delays incurred by messages are affected by several data ferry parameters : ( i ) routes taken to reach a village , ( ii ) schedules , ( iii ) speed , ( iv ) number of ferries , and ( v ) distance between kiosks . in a different work ,",
    "the pollen network @xcite uses humans as data ferries , where mobile devices carried by humans exchange information with each other , and/or with a fixed network .",
    "other projects that use data ferries include kiosknet @xcite , motopost @xcite , wizzy net @xcite , widernet @xcite , digital study hall @xcite , digitalgreen @xcite , body sensors @xcite , and digital polyclinic @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to date ,",
    "there are only a few multicast routing protocols .",
    "hence , there are ample opportunities to design new ones that incorporate the various strategies used by epidemic , dfs and proactive based routing protocols .",
    "in particular , only a few works have studied the efficacy of epidemic routing protocols in delivering bundles to multicast group members . thus far , in @xcite , the authors have only investigated epidemic with ttl .",
    "the authors , however , have not considered multicast sessions with a large number of subscribers , where a small ttl value may lead to bundles expiring prematurely .",
    "this means epidemic with ec or epidemic with immunity are better suited for multicasting in dtns .",
    "however , currently , no work has conducted any investigation on these two buffer policies .",
    "second , no researchers have studied the effect of anti - entropy in multicast scenarios . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors pointed out that ` comparing before exchanging ' is critical because it avoids duplicated bundles .",
    "this is important because once a node receives a bundle , it will never receive the bundle again even though said bundle has been discarded from its buffer .",
    "however , in multicast , given that there may be more than one subscriber , it is unclear whether anti - entropy will result in a lower bundle delivery ratio . intuitively , a node that has delivered a bundle , and subsequently deleted the bundle before meeting another subscriber should be given another copy of said bundle to improve bundle delivery ratio .",
    "third , no research has analyzed the impact of having multicast subscribers act as relay nodes to forward bundles . in every epidemic variant ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , subscribers are effectively sink nodes , and are not required to forward bundles to others . however , in multicast , it is unclear how this influences multicast delivery .",
    "this is an important consideration when there are more subscribers than non - subscribers or relay nodes . if there are only a few relay nodes , the probability of a subscriber meeting a relay node becomes less , which increases end - to - end delays . in the worst case ,",
    "only the source is the relay and all other nodes are subscribers .",
    "this means the source will have to meet each subscriber in order to deliver bundles .",
    "fourth , the size of a multicast group affects the delivery ratio of epidemic with ttl @xcite .",
    "their experiments show that when the multicast group size increases , the delivery ratio drops accordingly .",
    "in particular , when the multicast group size increases from two to 60 , delivery ratio reduces from 95% to 50% .",
    "however , it is unclear whether multicast group size has any impact on delivery ratio if subscribers do not forward bundles , or when nodes employ ec or immunity packets to discard bundles .",
    "this is because the ratio of multicast subscribers to non - subscribers is a critical issue as larger multicast group sizes mean fewer relay nodes , and vice - versa .",
    "moreover , in epidemic with immunity , the number of immunity packets corresponds to the multicast group size .",
    "increasing the multicast group size translates to proportionally more immunity packets .",
    "this , however , corresponds to faster bundle deletion despite some subscribers not having received the deleted bundles .",
    "the concept of dtns has matured significantly in the last decade , with a myriad of novel applications that range from tracking wildlife to exploiting the movement of humans .",
    "a notable application is providing connectivity to rural areas that otherwise would have been isolated from the internet . as a result , like the internet",
    ", it is almost impossible to predict what economical , social and technological impact dtns will have in the future .    a key underpinning that will ensure the success of dtns is the performance of routing protocols .",
    "in this respect , this paper has reviewed three main categories of routing protocols , where we provide a comprehensive qualitative comparison of key features within as well as between categories .",
    "furthermore , we presented the handful of works that aim to design efficient multicast routing protocols .",
    "we also highlighted the research methodologies used by existing works and the lack of a common set of parameters that can be used to evaluate existing protocols objectively .",
    "finally , we review an emerging area that aims to incorporate research from social networks and epidemiology in the hope of identifying invariant properties that will help enhance the performance of routing protocols . we believe this to be the next frontier in dtns research , especially in light of ubiquitous , powerful mobile devices that are equipped with ample storage , camera and positioning capability that are capable of carrying data as well as collecting context and social information .",

    "<S> a key underpinning in these networks is routing or data dissemination protocols that are designed specifically to handle the aforementioned characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a need to review state - of - the - art routing protocols , categorize them , and compare and contrast their approaches in terms of delivery rate , resource consumption and end - to - end delay . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , this paper reviews 63 unicast , multicast and coding - based routing protocols that are designed specifically to run in delay tolerant or challenged networks . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of all protocols , highlight their experimental setup and outline their deficiencies in terms of design and research methodology . apart from that , we review research that aims to exploit studies on social networks and epidemiology in order to improve routing protocol performance . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we provide a list of future research directions .    challenged networks , routing , disruption tolerant networks , epidemic , data dissemination </S>"
