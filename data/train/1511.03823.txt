    "the composition remains constant throughout the accretion phase . for higher entropies",
    ", although the value of the electron fraction may differ from @xmath55 during the accretion process , the differences produced in the thermodynamical variables lead to changes in the results of the riemann problem still below the numerical error of the method .    regarding the initial distribution of the magnetic field , we do not observe either any significant difference in the results in the two cases that we have considered , _ loop current _ and _ dipole_. given that we are comparing models with the same effective magnetic field , @xmath14 , and thus the same magnetic dipolar moment , the magnetic field is virtually identical at long radial distances and the only differences appear close to the ns surface . in practice",
    "the magnetic field structure only changes the details of the burial in the cases in which the equilibrium point is close to the burial depth ( the limiting line plotted in the figs .",
    "[ fig : reference ] to [ fig : eos_variation ] ) , but it does not change the location of the limit itself in a sensitive way . as a conclusion , we can say that the dominant ingredient affecting the burial of the magnetic field is the presence of a dipolar component of the magnetic field but , for order - of - magnitude estimations , a multipolar structure of the field is mostly irrelevant .",
    "we have studied the process of submergence of magnetic field in a newly born neutron star during a hypercritical accretion stage in coincidence with core collapse supernovae explosions .",
    "this is one of the possible scenarios proposed to explain the apparently low external dipolar field of ccos .",
    "our approach is based on 1d solutions of the relativistic riemann problem , which provide the location of the spherical boundary ( magnetopause ) matching an external non - magnetised accretion solution with an internal magnetic field potential solution . for a given accretion rate and magnetic field strength ,",
    "the magnetopause keeps moving inwards if the total ( matter plus ram ) pressure of the accreting fluid , exceeds the magnetic pressure below the magnetopause . exploring a wide range of accretion rates and field strengths , we have found the conditions for the magnetopause to reach the equilibrium point below the ns surface , which implies the burial of the magnetic field .",
    "our study has considered several models with different specific entropy , composition , and neutron star masses . assuming an accretion time of 1000s , our findings can be summarised by a general condition , rather independent on the model details , relating the required total accreted mass to bury the magnetic field with the field strength .",
    "an approximate fit is ( see dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : reference ] ) @xmath56    the most important caveat in our approach is that we are restricted to a simplistic 1d spherical geometry , which does not allow us to consistently account for the effect of different mhd instabilities that can modify the results .",
    "we also note that our scenario is quite different from the extensively studied case of x - ray binaries , in which the ns accretes matter from a companion but at much lower rates ( sub - eddington ) and matter is mostly transparent to radiation during accretion . in that case , matter cools down through x - ray emission during the accretion process . @xcite and @xcite already noticed this fact and predicted that the accretion will most likely be channeled through the magnetic poles , in analogy to the earth s magnetosphere . in the context of x - ray binaries , @xcite and @xcite were able to compute equilibrium solutions with a deformed magnetosphere and a cusp like accretion region at the magnetic poles .",
    "however , as the same authors pointed out , these systems are unstable to the interchange instability @xcite , a railegh - taylor - like instabilitiy in which magnetic field flux tubes from the magnetosphere can raise , allowing the fluid to sink .",
    "this might allow for the formation of bubbles of material that fall through the magnetosphere down to the ns surface . in the case of a fluid deposited on top of a highly magnetized region",
    ", modes with any possible wavelength will be unstable @xcite , however , in practice these instabilities are limited to the size of the magnetosphere ( @xmath57 ) in the angular direction . as the bubbles of accreted material sink , magnetic flux tubes raise , as long as their magnetic pressure equilibrates the ram pressure of the unmagnetized accreting fluid @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a natural way , the equilibrium radius computed in section  [ sec : riemann ] roughly determines the highest value at which the magnetic field can raise .",
    "this accretion mechanism through instabilities has been shown to work in the case of x - ray binaries in global 3d numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of the hypercritical accretion present in the supernova fallback ,",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities have been studied by @xcite .",
    "the simulations of @xcite also show that the height of the unstable magnetic field over the ns surface decreases with increasing accretion rate , for fixed ns magnetic field strength , as expected . using the method described in section  [ sec : riemann ] we have estimated the equilibrium height over the ns surface for the 4 models presented in fig .",
    "9 of @xcite , for their lower accretion rates ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "our results predict correctly the order of magnitude of the extent of the unstable magnetic field over the ns surface",
    ". therefore , our simple 1d model for the equilibrium radius serves as a good estimator of the radius confining the magnetic field during the accretion process , although details about the magnetic field structure can not be predicted .",
    "another important difference with the binary scenario is the duration of the accretion process . in x - ray binaries ,",
    "a low accretion rate is maintained over very long times , so that instabilities have always time to grow .",
    "in our case , hypercritical accretion can last only hundreds or thousands of seconds , and depending on the particular values of density and magnetic field , this may be too short for some instabilities to fully develop .",
    "this issue is out of the scope of this paper and deserves a more detailed study .",
    "our main conclusion is that a typical magnetic field of a few times @xmath0 g can in principle be buried by accreting only @xmath1 , a relatively modest amount of mass .",
    "this estimate has interesting implications : since it is likely that most neutron stars can undergo such an accretion process , and the field would only reemerge after a few thousand years @xcite , the cco scenario is actually not peculiar at all and we expect that most very young nss show actually an anomalously low value of the magnetic field . on the contrary ,",
    "magnetar - like field strengths are much harder to screen and the required accreted mass is very large , in some cases so large that the neutron star would collapse to a black hole .",
    "we also stress that the concept of _ burial _ of the magnetic field refers only to the large scale dipolar component , responsible for the magnetospheric torque spinning down the star .",
    "small scale structures produced by instabilities can exist in the vicinity of the star surface , and this locally strong field is likely to have a visible imprint in the star thermal spectrum , as in kes 79 @xcite , without modifying the spin - down torque .",
    "finally , we note that the slow reemergence process on timescales of kyrs mimics the increase of the magnetic field strength , and it is therefore consistent with a value of the braking index smaller than 3 @xcite , which should be common for all young pulsars in this scenario .",
