    "present experimental information available in the field of heavy - ion collisions allows for the systematic investigation of strongly interacting hadronic matter under extreme conditions .",
    "high statistics accumulated in various experiments facilitates reconstruction of hadronic resonances via their decay products . at cern - sps experiments",
    "several resonances have been identified so far : @xmath2 mesons are detected by na49 collaboration via @xmath3 decay  @xcite and by na50 via @xmath4 channel  @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath1 are seen by na49 in their dominant decay modes  @xcite , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons are measured by na50 in dimuon channel  @xcite .",
    "already the first preliminary data were surprising .",
    "total averaged @xmath8 meson multiplicity extracted from na49 data was found to be significantly smaller than that obtained from the extrapolation of preliminary na50 data .",
    "another interesting observation is that preliminary na49 data on @xmath5 multiplicity reveal significant suppression of the yield per participating nucleon when compared to inelastic proton - proton collisions .",
    "this contradicts to systematics of other strange particle abundance at sps energies .    suggested explanation of the @xmath8-meson puzzle  @xcite was that @xmath8-mesons decaying inside a fireball can disappear from the @xmath9 mass peak due to rescattering and absorption of secondary kaons in the surrounding medium .",
    "such mechanism has been quantitatively studied in  @xcite where suppression at the level 4060% has been obtained from simulation using rqmd code .",
    "similar mechanism could also account for @xmath5 suppression . in @xcite 75%",
    "suppression for @xmath2 and 50% for @xmath5 particles have been obtained within urqmd model .",
    "therefore the rescattering of resonance decay products can indeed explain in part some experimental observations .",
    "however , besides the lack of quantitative account of the difference in the extrapolated @xmath8 meson yields , other caveat has been issued in  @xcite : since the vacuum width of @xmath1 mesons is more than 3 times larger than the @xmath5 width , @xmath1 mesons decay inside a fireball more frequently and should be therefore suppressed even stronger than @xmath5 .",
    "the preliminary data of na49 @xcite do not show such a suppression for @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we discuss to what extent the in - medium modifications of the resonance decay width can effect the resonance suppression and help to accommodate empirical information .",
    "in our study we consider a two - stage picture of the hadronic phase of heavy - ion collision at sps energies which can be characterized by the notions of chemical and thermal freeze - outs  @xcite . at the initial stage of the hadronic phase we assume the temperature @xmath11 to be close to the qcd phase transition temperature @xmath12  mev .",
    "then the system expands up to the point , when numbers of different kinds of particles freeze in a chemical freeze - out .",
    "thermodynamical parameters of this stage could be obtained by fitting the final total hadron multiplicities .",
    "typical temperature is found to be @xmath13  mev  @xcite . during the second stage of collision ,",
    "elastic scattering processes change momentum distributions of hadrons in accord with a decreasing temperature until they cease and distributions freeze in .",
    "the freeze - out temperature can be extracted from a simultaneous fit to the single - particle @xmath14-spectra of different particles supplemented by the analysis of particle correlation data .",
    "typical temperatures are found to be @xmath15  mev  @xcite .",
    "the key assumption behind the decay product rescattering ( dpr ) mechanism of @xcite is that the final resonance distribution is formed at some stage between the chemical and thermal freeze - out . at this moment , mean free paths of the resonance , @xmath16 , pions , kaons and nucleons , @xmath17 , and the characteristic size of the fireball , @xmath18 , should satisfy [ mfp ] _ , _ k,_nr _ r. this implies that upon this stage resonances stream freely out from the fireball . for their decay products , pions and kaons , on the other hand , the surrounding medium is still opaque .",
    "therefore , if a resonance decays inside a fireball in hadronic channel , the decay products can be rescattered or absorbed , so that the resonance remains unobserved experimentally .",
    "it is now obvious that the possible increase of a resonance decay width in medium will enlarge the probability of its decay inside a fireball enhancing thereby the dpr mechanism . besides the total decay width of the resonance and the typical size of the fireball ,",
    "one of the crucial parameters controlling the efficiency of the dpr mechanism is , the life time of the fireball after the resonance freeze - out , @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the phase - space distribution of the resonance @xmath20 in the center - of - mass system of two colliding nuclei at the moment of its thermal freeze - out as @xmath21 .",
    "then the primary momentum distribution of the resonance is [ integr ] _ 0^(r)(p ) = 1,  = _",
    "f^(r ) ( , ) (  ) . where integration goes over the fireball volume within a freeze - out hyper - surface @xmath22 . in the absence of any in - medium modification of the resonance and rescattering of its decay products , the shape of the momentum distribution _ observed _ in the decay channel @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the partial and total decay widths of the resonance , respectively .",
    "accordingly , in the experimental analysis , the resonance distribution would be reconstructed from momentum distribution of decay products multiplied by the corresponding inverse branching ratio .",
    "taking into account modifications of partial and total widths of the resonance and the rescattering of decay products in medium we write expression for the observed resonance distributions in the decay channel @xmath23 in the following form _",

    "the probability of the decay products to leave fireball without any rescattering is @xmath32 . for the explicit form of @xmath32",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is written for the case of the two - particle decay . the quantity @xmath33 stands for the probability to identify a resonance from non - rescattered decay product .",
    "without in - medium effects we put @xmath34 assuming an ideal detector .",
    "if spectra of resonance decay products differ in medium from the vacuum ones , the momenta of secondary particles will change on the way out from the fireball even without being rescattered , since in this case a fireball serves as a potential well .",
    "this effect can be especially strong for strange resonances since the properties of kaons in the final state are strongly modified in nuclear matter or / and isospin asymmetrical pion gas  @xcite . for a rough estimation of the maximal suppression effect we put in this case @xmath35 .",
    "the time scale @xmath36 in ( [ ratrescat ] ) is the time spent by the resonance in medium .",
    "it is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the time during which the resonance with a velocity @xmath39 flies from the position @xmath28 till the border of the fireball . finally , in ( [ ratrescat ] ) we integrate over all initial resonance positions @xmath40 with the phase space distribution ( [ integr ] ) .",
    "in the case when the partial width of decay channel @xmath23 does not change in medium @xmath41 , decay products are not rescattered @xmath42 and the total width @xmath43 , we have [ ratmu ] _ j^(r)(p ) & = & ( ) + _ tot^(r ) 0 _ 0^ dt d(t ) .",
    "this expression corresponds , e.g. , to the case when resonances are reconstructed in the leptonic channels . note that for @xmath44 we have @xmath45 , for @xmath46 we have @xmath47 and if @xmath48 then @xmath49 .    after the general considerations we specify the model of the fireball expansion , which is used in our numerical calculations .",

    "parameters @xmath52 , @xmath50 , @xmath60 , serve as input for numerical evaluations below .",
    "the particular realization of ( [ ratrescat ] ) is a rather crude approximation .",
    "however , the final results are found @xcite to be rather insensitive to the details of hydrodynamical evolution of a fireball , being determined mainly by the values of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath60 .",
    "first we discuss numerical results obtained in  @xcite for @xmath63 meson yields reconstructed via @xmath9 and @xmath64 channels in central pb+pb collisions at 158  gev / n sps energy .",

    "we simulate this effect by decreasing the kaon mass , which can result e.g. from rescattering of kaons on pions through @xmath96 and heavier kaonic resonances  @xcite .",
