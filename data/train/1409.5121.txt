    "nuclear stellar clusters , ( nscs ) hosting massive black holes ( mbhs ) are thought to exist in a significant fraction of all galactic nuclei .",
    "their origin is still not well understood .",
    "two main scenarios were suggested for their origin : ( 1 ) the cluster infall scenario , in which stellar clusters inspiral to the galactic nucleus , disrupted , and thereby build up the nuclear cluster @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the nuclear star formation ( sf ) scenario , in which gas infalls into the nucleus and then transforms into stars through star formation processes . here",
    "we focus on the latter process , and study the long term effects of sf on the formation and evolution of nscs .",
    "the structure , evolution and dynamics of nscs have been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "these explored the general dynamics of nscs , and in particular nscs similar to the well - observed nsc in the milky way galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the presence of a young stellar disk in the central pc of gc , as well as dense concentration of hii regions and young stars throughout the central 100 pc of the milky - way @xcite provide evidence for a continuous star - formation in this region , both today and in the past @xcite .",
    "the majority of the observed stars in the gc are either late type main sequence stars or red giants , suggesting that most of the stars in the gc likely formed at least a few gyr ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the star formation rate in the central pc of the gc has decreased since then until it has dropped to a deep minimum 1 - 2 gyrs ago and increased again during the last few hundred myrs , suggesting that there are number of epochs of star formation .",
    "evidence for star formation exists in other extagalactic nscs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite argued that nscs are protobulges that grow by repeated accretion of gas and subsequent star formation , @xcite suggested a nsc in - situ star formation model regulated by momentum feedback .",
    "these various studies provide further motivation and suggest that star - formation has an important role in shaping nscs and their evolution .",
    "nevertheless , very few studies systematically explored its role , while most studies focused on the cluster - infall scenario . here , we focus on the role of in - situ sf in nscs , and explore its implication both for the build - up of the nsc , as well as the long term evolution and structure of nscs .",
    "our work makes use of the fokker - planck diffusion equations , first used by @xcite in this context , to describe the dynamics of stellar populations in dense clusters around mbhs .    in",
    "the following we begin by a brief description of the original fokker - planck method used to study mbh - hosting clusters , and then describe our approach of adding an additional source term and multiple populations to account for the effects of sf .",
    "we than present the resulting nsc structure arising from the sf - included evolution , as characterized by the number density and age distribution of its constituent stellar populations .",
    "we explore various possible models for the nsc sf history and study their outcomes .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and their implications for the formation of nsc , nuclear cores and age segregated populations and summarize .",
    "nscs are complex interacting systems . their evolution and dynamics are mainly affected by 2-body relaxation ( see section [ sub : the - basic - model ] ) .",
    "theoretical studies of nscs based on 2-body relaxation include simulations of many - particle systems under a potential generated by a massive body ( mbh ) .",
    "one method to obtain realistic model of nscs is through a full n - body simulation .",
    "however , running these simulations to describe the evolution of realistic nscs is currently still too computationally expensive , and only a few studies involving n - body simulations of relatively small nscs have been done ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other , more efficient methods , though more limited in their application and dependence on specific assumptions , make use of the fokker - planck ( fp ) diffusion equation approach @xcite ( also solved through monte - carlo simulations @xcite ) . here",
    "we follow the latter and study the evolution of nscs by numerically solving the fp equations following the approach first used by bahcall & wolf ( bw;1976,1977 ) in this context . however , we supplement the basic equations , for the first time , with a source term accounting for sf , as well as use a large number of distinct stellar populations to account for different sf epochs .",
    "we also parallelized the fp code as to allow us to easily explore the nsc with both high resolution and a large number of stellar population . with these tools in hand",
    "we obtain for a model for the long term evolution of sf in nscs with in - situ sf . in the following we provide a brief discussion of the original fp approach , and then present the additional sf source term , as well as discuss the model assumptions and limitations .",
    "following the model introduced by bahcall & wolf ( 1976 , 1977 ) , we simulate the evolution in time , @xmath0 of the energy , @xmath1 distribution function ( df ) - @xmath2 and the number density of stars in a spherical system around a mbh , with a mass of @xmath3 ( the latter is chosen to be similar to the mbh mass in the gc ) .",
    "we focus on the distribution of stars in central few pcs , and in particular in the range between the tidal radius - @xmath4below which regular stars are disrupted by the mbh , and the radius of influence where the stellar motions are dominated by the mbh potential , defined by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the typical radius and mass of stars in the nsc , respectively ; and @xmath8 is the velocity dispersion of stars just outside the nsc .",
    "the velocity dispersion in our model is * @xmath9 * ( consistent with m - sigma relation ; * * @xcite ) . for @xmath10",
    "the original bw model assumes the existence of a `` thermal bath '' which supplies stars to the inner region the galactic nucleus .",
    "the stellar orbits are assumed to be keplerian in this range .",
    "the model timescale is dominated by the relaxation time , which is defined for a single mass system as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the stellar density , and @xmath13 is the coulomb logarithm , a factor which is related to the scale of the system ( @xmath14 . the simulation is done by solving the time and energy - dependent , angular momentum - averaged particle conservation equation .",
    "this fp equations describes the two - body diffusion of stars in energy phase space within the boundary conditions , i.e. between the fixed thermal bath reservoir of stars stars outside the radius of influence and the mbh sink , where the distribution is null on the tidal radius .",
    "the stars in the reservoir ( @xmath15 are assumed to have a maxwellian distribution , with the energy dependent distribution :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the number density of stars in the clusters core . inside the radius of influence ( @xmath18 the distribution function is evaluated using the fp diffusion equation with a loss - cone term ( which will be discussed in the following ) :    @xmath19    where @xmath20    the term @xmath21 $ ] is related to the stellar flow , and plays an important role in the evolution of the stellar cluster . it presents the flow of stars in energy space due to two - body relaxation , it is defined by :    @xmath22    the sink term @xmath23 is the rate at which stars , with energies in the interval @xmath24 , flow into the mbh and are therefore lost from the system ( hence the term loss - cone ) through disruption by the mbh at the tidal radius , and it is approximated by    @xmath25    the added @xmath23 term corresponds to the empty loss - cone regime ; once the rate of angular momentum diffusion exceeds the  pinhole regime limit , the full loss cone regime dominates the tidal disruption dynamics and the tidal disruption rate saturates .",
    "we therefore take @xmath26 , as a simple approximation accounting for the transition between the empty and full loss - cone regimes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the bw 1d fp equation allows stars to diffuse only in energy phase space , and do not account for stars with small angular momentum that may be disrupted as they approach the mbh though highly eccentric orbits , which pericenter becomes smaller than the tidal radius .",
    "the above loss - cone term is an added term which effectively accounts for the loss through angular momentum @xcite , which is not properly accounted for in the 1d fp equation in energy phase space .      in our model",
    "we simulate the star formation in the gc through adding an extra source term component to the fokker - planck equation . *",
    "* @xcite also used a source term with fp equation for modeling inflow of planetesimals .",
    "the term s value and range in our model are determined according to the number of new stars added in the appropriate region .",
    "we simulate multiple stellar populations forming at different epochs , and follow the evolution of their distribution .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulated nscs include a background stellar population that either evolves from an initial steady state bw distribution or is initially zero and is then entirely built up from the in - situ star formation .",
    "the modified fokker - planck equation with the addition of the source term ( and the loss - cone term ) has the form :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29 is a rectangular function , which boundaries correspond to the region where new stars are assumed to from ; @xmath30 is the source term amplitude ; and @xmath31 is a power - law function with a slope @xmath32 , defining the sf distribution in phase space .",
    "we simulated a number of nsc evolutionary scenarios , taking different models for the sf function ( rate and spatial structure ) and for the background population ( see section [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "the chosen slope of the sf function was motivated by the observed power - law @xcite distribution of young stars observed in the young stellar disk in the gc .      in order to calculate the distribution and the number density profile of stellar populations in the modeled nscs",
    ", we numerically integrate the differential equations presented in bw77 ( including an effective tidal disruption loss - cone sink term ) , supplemented with the additional source , in order to follow the long term evolution of the nsc stellar populations .",
    "our code is based on the original code written by @xcite , which was significantly modified , as follows : ( 1 ) it includes the added sf source term as discussed above ; ( 2 ) it now includes both empty and full loss - cone dynamics , which were not consistently included before ; ( 3 ) we use the simple moving window average method to deal with numerical instabilities , which lead to fluctuations in the numerical solution in previous treatments ; and ( 4 ) to improve the numerical resolution and reduce computation time , our algorithm was parallelized using openmp library , allowing for efficient calculation of higher resolution grids and the modeling of a large number of stellar populations .",
    "in our work we use a simplified 1d fp model , and consider only a single mass for all stars .",
    "multi - mass populations can affect the dynamical evolution of the nsc both through the potentially faster relaxation induced by more massive stars , as well as through mass - segregation processes , which may induce different distributions for different mas stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . * * multiple mass populations and mass - changes due to stellar evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) , are beyond the scope of this study and will be explored elsewhere .",
    "we consider only nscs hosting a mbhs of @xmath33 @xmath34 similar to the gc mbh , and assume no growth of the mbh during the evolution .",
    "similar to previous studies @xcite , it is assumed that the gravitational potential is always dominated by the mbh , and the contribution of the nsc stellar mass to the gravitational potential is neglected .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as long as the nsc mass is smaller , or comparable to that of the mbh .",
    "this is generally true for our simulated nsc , as we consider regions of up to a few pcs away from the mbh ; typically comparable to the mbh radius of influence .",
    "we do note that in the simulations with the highest stellar densities this assumption becomes somewhat weaker for the outskirts of the nsc , a few pcs away from the mbh .",
    "nevertheless , the range at which our analysis exceeds the @xmath35 is not more than twice of it , and the difference in the typical parameters ( i.e. @xmath36 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 ) is expected to be small .",
    "moreover , the relaxation times in these regions are very long and very little evolution , if any , is expected to occur there as to significantly affect the nsc bulk population .",
    "newly formed stars are assumed to form isotropically .",
    "hence , we do not self - consistently take into account the possibility of star - formation in a disk - like configuration ( e.g. the gc stellar disk ; @xcite , and stellar disks in extra - galactic nscs ; @xcite ) . in principle other source terms of stars",
    "can exist , such as stars captured following a binary disruption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could have very different distribution and affect the nsc dynamics @xcite .",
    "we postpone treatment of such qualitatively different source terms to future studies .    finally , our models only include 2-body scattering relaxation processes by stars , and do not include effects of coherent resonant relaxation @xcite or 2-body relaxation by massive perturbers @xcite .",
    "we consider two general types of models . in the first we study the build - up of an nsc around a mbh , in which all stars originate from long - term in - situ sf processes , modeled through the fp sf source term . in the second",
    ", we consider a pre - existing nsc with an initial steady - state bw structure , and study the effect of adding sf to the cluster , to explore the distribution and evolution of stellar populations which form at different epochs .",
    "we simulated various scenarios that describe the evolution of nscs , and the stellar populations that compose them .",
    "we consider a variety of different scenarios , summarized in tables [ tab : initial - structures ,-",
    "sf ] and [ tab : results ] .",
    "the specific initial conditions , and the characteristics of sf in nscs are not known , and we therefore study a variety of possible cases . these differ in their sf rates and history , the regions where sf occur , the typical masses of stars in the nscs , and whether they include a pre - existing nsc or not .",
    "naturally , the different scenarios are not exhaustive , but they provide a basic characterization of a range of plausible , though simplified scenarios for nsc evolution .",
    "the regions where sf occurs are motivated by the observed young stars in the young stellar disk ( for models with sf in the inner @xmath38 pc ) , and the circum - nuclear disk in the gc as well as evidence for long term sf in the central 100 pc of the mw ( for models with sf in the inner 1.5 - 5 pc region ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we consider only single mass models ; in particular we study cases where the mean mass of stars is assumed to be either 0.8 or 0.6 @xmath39 .",
    "the stellar radii are also changed , assuming a mass - radius relation of @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding tidal radii used are then changed accordingly ; see table * [ tab : initial - structures ,-",
    "all the models are evolved for a hubble time . in most models",
    "one population represents the background initial stellar population of the cusp ( or the stellar population that formed at an early stage of the nsc evolution ) and ten additional populations are later introduced consecutively to study the evolution of stars formed at different epochs , up to 1 ( or 3 ) gyrs ago .",
    "each population represents stars forming over a continuous range of 100 ( or 300 ) myrs , and introduced continuously after the the end of the previous sf epoch ( beside model 8 , where we consider 100 myrs sf bursts once every gyr , i.e. separated by long quiescent times ) .",
    "stellar populations formed much earlier typically have sufficient time to achieve an almost steady state solution , very similar to the bw solution , and are not studied in details by themselves , but only considered together ( as part of the first / background population ) , while younger populations are not relaxed , and show a differential behavior ( see below ) .",

    "fig [ evolution_plot ] demonstrates ( model 7 in table [ tab : initial - structures ,- sf ] ) the build - up and structure evolution of an nsc which grows through a continuous long - term in - situ star formation .",
    "the final configuration of this nsc is very similar to that of a steady state bw cusp , and the number densities are comparable to those observed in the gc . however , in the bw77 scenario stars flow from the external region of the nsc ( i.e. from the background `` thermal bath '' ) into the the central regions ; in the sf scenario , the stars are formed in the star - forming region , and slowly diffuse away to produce a flow which can be reversed in direction compared with the flow in the bw77 model .",
    "the flow direction is important when discussing populations formed at different ages ; since older stars had more time to diffuse they could be observed farther away from the sf region compared with younger stars , and the general direction of the stellar flow would determine the differential distribution of older vs. younger star ( e.g. an inflow would lead to older stars dominating the inner regions , while an outflow will lead to older stars dominating the outer region ) .",
    "the rate at which stars diffuse in phase space and attain a steady state depends on the relaxation time of the system .",
    "systems with shorter relaxation times will attain a relaxed configuration , while those with slower relaxation times might still preserve signatures of their initial conditions ( e.g. the distribution of an unrelaxed population of stars might be closer to that of their initial post - sf distribution ) . in fig . [",
    "fig : relaxation ] we show the dependence of the relaxation time on the distance from the mbh for the different evolutionary scenarios .",
    "we see that the behavior of the relaxation time hardly changes with time in the case where a pre - existing bw cusp is set in place prior to the initial evolution . in this case",
    "the background population dominates the relaxation rate .",
    "however , in models where the nsc is built completely by sf the initial number densities are small , and they slowly increase as more stars are formed .",
    "this is reflected by the relaxation time evolution , which becomes systematically shorter as the nsc is built and becomes denser .",
    "the relaxation times converge to those seen in the case of the initial bw cusp , once the nsc grows to comparable masses .",
    "the in - situ built nscs therefore have longer relaxation times during most of their evolution and would better preserve signatures of the sf history and structure , and differential structures of stellar populations formed at different epochs .",
    "as summarized in tables [ tab : initial - structures ,-",
    "sf ] and [ tab : results ] , we have explored various models for nscs and their sf histories .",
    "the final structures of these nscs after 10 gyrs of evolution are summarized in table [ tab : results ] and in figs .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , [ fig : scn1 - 6 ] and [ fig : scn7 - 12 ] .",
    "the four right columns of table [ tab : results ] summarize some of the mean properties of the clusters , including the range of core sizes observed ( i.e. where a power - law number density profiles break to become significantly shallower ) for the young stellar populations , the total number of stars in the nsc ( up to 2 pc from the mbh ) and the nsc relaxation time ( at 2 pc from the mbh ) .",
    "the relaxation time is calculated according to equation [ eq : relaxation ] .",
    "[ fig : scn1 - 6 ] and [ fig : scn7 - 12 ] show the detailed number density profile of the stellar populations in each cluster .",
    "many of these models show the existence of a core - like structure for the young stellar populations , where the cores vary in size , and are systematically bigger for younger populations .",
    "this can be seen in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ; similar plots are shown for the other models in figs . [",

    "in this work we studied the formation and evolution of nuclear star clusters , while taking into account the effects of in - situ star - formation using fokker - plank modeling .",
    "we explored two types of scenarios : ( 1 ) pre - existing nscs with a bw - like structure that experience later sf and ( 2 ) nscs built - up completely from in - situ sf .",
    "both type of models assume that several epochs of gas - infall into the nuclear region triggered sf , transforming the infalling gas into newly born stars ( e.g. following ) .",
    "the specific properties of such sf epoch are unknown , and various models for sf histories , rates and spatial characteristics have been explored . in",
    "the following we discuss the outcomes of the evolution of such nscs .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn7 - 12 ] , nscs built - up from in - situ sf ( models 7 , 10 and 12 ) give rise to nscs dominated by the stellar population formed at earlier stages ( first few gyrs ) .",
    "the structure of the older population is very similar to a steady - state bw - cusp , and the total number of stars is comparable to that inferred for the gc nsc . models with significantly lower rates of sf ( not shown ) can not , by themselves , reproduce number densities comparable to the nsc , and can only form a low mass nsc with a large core ( for sf outside the central 2 pcs ) or a very compact low mass nsc ( for sf inside the central 2 pc - model 2b ) .",
    "conversely , models with high sf rates ( @xmath42yr@xmath43 ) , give rise to high stellar densities , and the resulting shortening of the relaxation times lead to the formation of an nsc and its fast relaxation into a steady state bw - like configuration , very similar to that obtained in the absence of sf .",
    "however , a significant negative feedback takes place in this case , and the typical inflow of stars in the bw - like models is replaced by an outflow , and though the number densities of such nscs are higher than bw - like models , they only grow by a factor of a few , even where extreme ( likely unrealistic ) models of high sf rates ( @xmath44@xmath45 ) are tested ( not shown ) .",
    "we also note that when lower mass stellar populations ( models 11 - 12 ) are assumed ( e.g. if different initial mass function are considered ) the relaxation times become longer , as expected , and late - formed younger populations are far from achieving a steady state structure , producing larger core - like structures , as discussed in more details below .",
    "the study of multiple stellar populations formed at different epochs allow us to study the distribution of stellar ages in nscs .",
    "in particular , many of the models studied here show a differential structure of different age populations .",
    "older stellar populations are more relaxed than younger ones , and therefore present qualitatively and quantitatively different number density profiles .",
    "older populations of ages comparable with the cluster relaxation time achieve a bw - like cuspy steady state , while younger populations behave differently .",
    "young populations in models with sf at the outer regions of the nscs present large cores in their inner number density profile , with younger populations showing larger cores ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , [ fig : scn1 - 6 ] and [ fig : scn7 - 12 ] .",
    "given the long relaxation times in some of the nsc models , the relaxation and slow diffusion of stars from the outer regions to the inner ones can take longer than the age of these stellar populations , leading to low stellar densities in the inner regions and the core structure .",
    "conversely , scenarios in which sf occurs in the inner regions show , in some cases , a significant differentiation of stellar population in the outer regions , effectively producing an age segregated structure ; different regions in the nsc outskirts are dominated by populations of different ages , with the oldest populations outside and younger populations closer in .",
    "these different behaviors are well demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] . * * a closer examination of the age segregation in the nscs is shown in fig [ fig : mean_age ] , where the mean age of the newly formed stars ( the 1 - 3 gyrs old population , depending on the model and not including the older backgro        it is interesting to note that the cluster - infall scenario can also lead to age segregated nscs , as discussed in detail by @xcite , and the age distribution of stellar populations in nscs can help study not only their sf history , but potentially the impact of both the in - situ sf and the cluster - infall scenario roles in the build - up of nsc",
    ". however , the contribution of both processes may also give rise to a complex age - structure of nsc .",
    "the behavior of nscs built from the combination of both processes is beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "as discussed above , we find that after a @xmath4610 gyr of nsc evolution , the younger stellar populations in nscs may evolve to a core - like distribution , while older population already become progressively cuspier .",
    "these results are of great interest in light of the recent findings about the structure of the galactic center nsc .",
    "findings by several different groups have provided strong evidence for a core - like density profile for red - giants observed in the gc @xcite .",
    "though the exact size of this core is still debated , it extends throughout the central few 0.1 pcs , with some three dimensional modeling suggesting a core as large as 1 pc @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , cores are ubiquitous components of galaxies with mbhs , at least in galaxies that are bright enough or near enough for parsec - scale features to be resolved @xcite . in the gc ,",
    "observational biases limit the study of number density profiles only to the most luminous stars , and therefore the number density profile of main - sequence low mass stars is still unknown . whether the core - like structure represents the overall distribution of stars in the gc or only that of evolved red - giants stars is therefore still an open question , with some important implications .",
    "such core - like density profiles in the central part of the gc would give rise to long relaxation times and slow dynamical evolution .",
    "the combined effect of slow relaxation as well as low stellar densities would be a low rate of tidal disruption events , as well as low rate of extreme mass - ratio gravitational - wave inspirals ( emris ) .",
    "in particular , if the gc is representative of the structure of typical nscs around low mass mbhs , the total event rates from such mbh - star strong interactions could be significantly lower than that expected from nscs with a bw - cusp distribution .",
    "several models were suggested to explain the origin of the gc core .",
    "some suggest it only represents the distribution of red giants , which were preferentially destroyed through stellar collisions @xcite , and/or interaction with clumps in a gaseous disk @xcite . however , the expected realistic collision rates are far too low to explain a core distribution much larger than @xmath47 pc @xcite .",
    "the model for collisions with clumps in gaseous disk @xcite is extremely dependent on the distance from the mbh and assumptions on the radial number density profile of the gas , and may therefore potentially explain only small cores ( @xmath480.1 pc ; compared with the 0.5 - 1 pc cores inferred from 3d modeling of the observations ) under specific assumptions .",
    "another possibility is that the observed core distribution represents all stars , not only the red giants .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown the the cluster - infall scenario could lead to the formation of nscs with significant cores .",
    "such cores are not limited to a specific type of stars ( such as red giants ) , as in the other models discussed above , but represent all the stellar population ( though age segregation could show different distributions for stars coming from clusters infalling at different time ; nevertheless , a large difference in the core distribution of stars from different clusters is not expected ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a binary merger , or a triaxial potential could deplete the inner regions of an nsc producing a large core , and have shown that the long relaxation times would not be sufficient to regrow a cusp .",
    "a similar behavior is seen in our models , where progressively younger populations of stars formed in the outer regions of the nsc do not relax and grow an inner cusp .",
    "though in both cases slow relaxation explains the non - growth of the inner cusp , the origins of the initial core in both models differ , and the outcomes could significantly differ as well . in particular , the sf models studied here suggest that cores of different sizes could exist for different stellar populations , and in particular an nsc can have both a cusp distribution of old stars and a core distribution for young and intermediate age stars .",
    "we note that younger , more massive red giants could be more luminous and more easily detected in observations @xcite . we therefore hypothesize that if such younger red - giants ( up to 2 - 3 gyrs old ) are overly represented in observations then the observed core could be limited to these younger populations , while the underlying population of older stars might still have a cusp distribution .",
    "this can be well demonstrated both in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn7 - 12 ] and in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : core ] where the model results are compared with the 3d modeled number density profile determined by @xcite based on observations .",
    "as can be seen , in some models a large , pc size core of up to a few gyrs old stellar populations can exist .",
    "such a core might be consistent with the density profiles inferred from observations , while the old stellar population preserves a typical bw - like cusp profile .",
    "an interesting basic prediction of such models would therefore be for stars of different ages to show a different positions for the break in their distribution , between an inner cusp and an outer core .",
    "a deeper study of the observational properties and stellar evolution of populations in such models of sf origin for the core is to be done elsewhere .    the number density profile of the gc nuclear cluster after 10 gyr evolution ( and total star formation epoch of 3 gyr ) compared to the inferred range of number density profiles from 3d modeling of gc observations @xcite .",

    "our models follow the dynamics of several stellar populations near an mbh of @xmath49 driven by 2-body relaxation processes .",
    "we find , by comparing to observations , that the scenario of nscs arising from in - situ star formation can be proposed as a realistic model of galactic nuclei formation .",
    "we show that the old stellar populations have a cuspy distribution near an mbh ( which corresponds to the classical bahcall & wolf model ) , while the younger populations behave differently , depending on the regions where star - formation occurs .",
    "stars formed in the nsc outskirts tend to distribute in a core - like distribution , where the size of the core decreases with time , with different stellar population potentially showing different number density profiles .",
    "in particular , younger stellar populations may have larger cores .",
    "we explore such age segregation in nscs , and present the age gradient produced through the evolution of several population arising from star formation at different epochs .",
    "we find that our results might explain the origin of the core - like distribution of red giants in the galactic center , and suggest that it might be limited to intermediate age stellar populations ( @xmath483 gyrs old ) , while the underlying old stellar population might have a cuspy structure .",

    "<S> nuclear stellar cluster ( nscs ) are known to exist around massive black holes ( mbhs ) in galactic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> two formation scenarios were suggested for their origin : ( 1 ) build - up of nscs from consecutive infall of stellar cluster and ( 2 ) continuous in - situ star - formation . </S>",
    "<S> though the cluster - infall scenario has been extensively studied , the in - situ formation scenario have been hardly explored . </S>",
    "<S> here we use fokker - planck ( fp ) calculations to study the effects of star formation on the build - up of nscs and its implications for their long term evolution and their resulting structure . </S>",
    "<S> we use the fp equation to describe the evolution of stellar populations , and add appropriate source terms to account for the effects of newly formed stars . </S>",
    "<S> we show that continuous star - formation even 1 - 2 pc away from the mbh can lead to the build - up of an nsc with properties similar to those of the milky - way nsc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the structure of the old stellar population in the nsc with in - situ star - formation could be very similar to the steady - state bahcall - wolf cuspy structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , its younger population do not yet achieve a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , formed / evolved nscs with in - situ star - formation contain differential age - segregated stellar populations which are not yet fully mixed . </S>",
    "<S> younger stellar populations formed in the outer regions of the nsc have a cuspy structure towards the nsc outskirts , while showing a core - like distribution inwards ; with younger populations having larger core sizes . in principal , such a structure can give rise to an apparent core - like radial distribution of younger stars , as observed in the galactic center . </S>"
