    "the galactic center ( hereafter gc ) region is still one of the most enigmatic regions of our galaxy , despite the deep investigations performed in the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the extreme interstellar absorption severely affects its observability , especially in the optical / ultraviolet range .",
    "the interstellar medium is transparent for energies below 2@xmath4 m and above @xmath32 kev .",
    "thus , the x  ray band is one of the privileged observing windows for the gc . since a large concentration of mass exists towards the gc direction , the crowding of sources , at all energies , is severe as well .",
    "for this reason , instruments with a good spatial resolution are needed .",
    "several peculiar objects are present within a few parsec from the center of our galaxy , including the sgra complex , a remarkable ensemble of structures observed in the radio band .",
    "it is composed by at least four distinct objects ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : the sgra east shell , the sgra east halo , the sgra west hii region , with its mini  spiral shape , and the compact non  thermal radio source sgr  a*. the first two structures are non  thermal radio sources .",
    "their real nature is not clear from the radio observations alone .",
    "they might be supernova remnants or by  products of a past outburst of activity from the gc .",
    "sgr  a * , located at the dynamical center of our galaxy , is thought to be a super  massive black hole of about 2.5@xmath5 solar masses .",
    "the presence of such a large dark mass towards it is supported by the measurements of the mass distribution and dynamics of infrared stars in the central parsec of the galaxy ( e.g. , ghez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the overall spectrum of sgr  a * is still poorly determined .",
    "up to now there are no sicure counterparts of sgr  a * at any other wavelengths , with the exception of the recent detection with @xmath6 ( baganoff et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the center of our galaxy is rather silent at high energies , emitting at a level which is several orders of magnitude below the eddington luminosity for a super  massive black hole of its mass .",
    "in fact , the hard x  ray images obtained with coded  mask detectors have shown that the high energy activity previously detected with non  imaging instruments and associated with the gc , is instead produced by two black hole candidates of stellar origin , 1e  1740.72942 and grs  1758258 , unrelated to the gc .",
    "previous x  ray observations led to the discovery that a high density of point  like sources exists towards the gc .",
    "these sources include several transients , i.e. objects that are bright in x ",
    "rays only sporadically .",
    "it is unclear whether this concentration follows the stellar mass density or if there is evidence of an additional population of x  ray sources .",
    "the bright sources ( l@xmath7 erg s@xmath8 ) are binaries containing compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes ) accreting matter from stellar companions ( probably of low mass ) .",
    "some of these sources are particularly interesting , belonging to the class of  micro  quasars \" , with relativistic , double - sided radio jets .",
    "the gc region is also characterized by strong diffuse x ",
    "ray emission , first observed with the @xmath9 observatory ( watson et al .",
    "the @xmath10 satellite revealed the presence of a 6.7  kev line emission from the galactic plane which was particularly intense towards the gc direction ( koyama et al .",
    "the asca satellite confirmed the presence of this diffuse component , which extends symmetrically with respect to the gc .",
    "its spectrum is well described by a thermal hot plasma with a temperature of @xmath117  kev , but there is also evidence for a multi  temperature plasma .",
    "in fact , several emission lines are present , with the k  lines from iron and sulfur ( at @xmath32.4 kev ) particularly bright ( koyama et al .",
    "the nature of the diffuse emission is still unknown , especially since its temperature is too high to allow the confinement of the emitting plasma by the galactic gravity .",
    "part of it ( especially that at the lower energy region of the spectrum ) could be due to the integrated thermal emission from supernova remnants .",
    "other emitting processes have been proposed in order to reject the thermal nature of this component or to decrease its temperature : non  thermal emission from snrs , inverse compton scattering by relativistic electrons , emission lines of non  thermal origin produced during capture of electrons by accelerated ions , charge exchange by low energy heavy ions with neutral gas , non  thermal emission from the interaction of low energy cosmic ray electrons with the interstellar medium ( see , e.g. , the recent results of valinia et al . 2000 ) .",
    "another diffuse component was discovered with asca : a 6.4  kev iron line component of fluorescent origin , the extent of which well correlates with the distribution of the molecular clouds in the gc region ( koyama et al .",
    "this emission is thought to be the result of irradiation of the dense molecular clouds by hard photons coming from bright x  ray sources , located inside or outside the cloud .",
    "however , this emission seems too intense to be due to reprocessing of hard x ",
    "rays from any known source in the gc region .",
    "thus , a possible explanation is that the illuminating source could have been sgr  a * , during a past phase of high - energy activity ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; churazov et al . 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the study of the diffuse component can also cast light on the past high energy activity from the gc itself .",
    "i report here on the results of the survey ( 1997 - 1998 ) of the gc region performed with the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on - board the bepposax satellite ( boella et al . 1997 ) .",
    "only data obtained from the mecs instrument ( 210 kev energy range ) are relevant here .",
    "in particular , the main objects of this study are the following :    * the spectral properties of the point  like x  ray sources , low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) containing neutron stars and black holes , both displaying persistent and transient emission ; * the x  ray counterpart of sgr  a * , its spectrum and its emission level ; * the spectrum and spatial distribution of the diffuse emission from the gc region .",

    "is not included in this mosaic ( see sidoli et al . 1999 and sidoli 2000 for a detailed description of the analysis and results ) .",
    "we discovered new x  ray sources : the x  ray emission of plerionic origin coming from the radio core of the composite supernova remnant g0.9 + 01 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "1998 ; sidoli et al .",

    "ray binaries containing neutron stars ( indicated by type i x  ray bursts ) or black holes ( with spectra similar to the  low  hard state \" of the well know black hole candidate cyg  x1 ) are shown in fig .  3 , where a single power - law model has been used to fit the 210  kev emission . the large range in interstellar absorbing column density is also shown in fig .  4 in dependence of the galactic latitude , that can be translated into height from the galactic plane , since all these sources are likely located at the gc distance .",
    "the large concentration of mass towards the gc direction severely complicates the analysis of the x  ray emission from sgr  a * , especially with the mecs instrument , the spatial resolution of which is at a level of 1@xmath15 ( @xmath32.5 pc at the gc distance ) . both the presence of the diffuse emission , peaking at the gc , and several point  like sources ( known from previous missions and displayed in the fig .",

    "1981 , 0.54.5 kev ) the point  like source 1e  1742.52859 , positionally coincident with sgr  a * , was discovered .",
    "a diffuse component around the gc was also detected .",
    "the rosat satellite observed this same region in the 0.12.4  kev energy range ( predehl & trumper , 1994 ) and , in addition to the diffuse emission , showed the presence of three different sources .",
    "one of these sources is highly absorbed and located within @xmath22 from sgr  a*. other x  ray sources are located within few arcminutes from sgr  a * : the transient a  1742289 , discovered in outburst with ariel  v in 1975 ( branduardi et al . 1976 ) and the lmxb ax  j1745.62901 ( maeda et al . 1996 ) .    the spectrum and flux to be ascribed to the gc point source(s ) have been estimated ( using the mecs data only ) extracting counts from a circular region with @xmath23 radius centered at the position of the x ",
    "ray peak flux ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "a local background has been taken from an external annular region ( @xmath24 ) , in order to subtract the contribution of the diffuse emission .",
    "several emission lines ( especially the sulfur line at @xmath25  kev and the iron line at 6.7  kev ) are present in this spectrum , indicative of a contamination from the diffuse emission , that indeed peaks at the gc position .",
    "a good fit has been obtained with a hot plasma model with a temperature of @xmath26  kev , absorbed by a column density , n@xmath27 , of 7@xmath28  @xmath19 .",
    "no evidence for a 6.4  kev line of fluorescent origin is present , contrary to what is found from the surrounding diffuse emission ( see next section ) .",
    "the 210  kev flux corrected for the absorption is @xmath29  erg  @xmath19  s@xmath8 and the luminosity is @xmath30  erg  s@xmath8 ( a distance of 8.5 kpc is assumed ) . since also the diffuse emission contributes to this flux , only an upper limit to the emission from sgr  a * can be placed , at a level of @xmath31  erg  s@xmath8 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "this estimate has been obtained extrapolating the surface brightness of the diffuse emission from the surrounding region up to the sgr  a * position , and assuming that all the net flux is contributed only by sgr  a*.    recently , a @xmath6 observation of the gc detected one weak source , probably the real counterpart to sgr  a * , with a luminosity , l@xmath17 , of @xmath32  erg  s@xmath8 ( 0.110  kev ) ( baganoff et al .",
    "the diffuse x  ray emission from the innermost 4 degrees along the galactic plane has been mapped with four mecs pointed observations .",
    "the regions considered for the spectral analysis are indicated in fig .",
    "they are marked by circles ( radii = 8@xmath15 ) representing the inner part of the field of view of four mecs pointings .",
    "[ fig : diff ]    the fields include sgr  d ( l@xmath31.06 , b@xmath30.14 ; field n.  3 ) , sgr  b2 ( l@xmath30.65 , b@xmath30.04 ; field n.  2 ) , sgr  a ( gc , field n.  1 ) and sgr  c ( l@xmath3359.4 , b@xmath30.11 ; field n.  4 ) , the main gc molecular clouds complexes as derived with the co surveys ( e.g. oka et al .",
    "these molecular clouds are part of a large layer of neutral gas distributed along the galactic plane ( width@xmath350  pc , length @xmath3500  pc ) .",
    "the mecs instrument is particularly suited for the study of the diffuse sources , due to its simple and unstructured point spread function .",
    "all the spectra were extracted from within 8@xmath15 from the pointing direction in order to use the region of the detector with the best spatial and spectral properties ( and also , in some cases , to avoid off  axis point sources ) . only the spectrum from the sgr",
    "a pointing was extracted from an annular corona with outer and inner radii of 8@xmath15 and 2@xmath15 respectively , in order to avoid the central point source(s ) and the probable counterpart to sgr  a*.      the overall spectrum from the sgra complex displays several emission lines . a fit with a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum plus three gaussian lines centered at @xmath31.8 , 2.4 and 6.7  kev , to account for the most prominent emission lines in the spectrum ( from si , s and fe respectively ) , resulted in a temperature of @xmath313 kev .",
    "however this temperature is too high to be consistent with the presence of the low energy emission lines .",
    "a possible explanation is a multi - temperature plasma .",
    "thus , we fitted the spectrum with two thermal emission plasma models .",
    "the best fit parameters are kt@xmath33@xmath30.6  kev and kt@xmath34@xmath38  kev . a gaussian line added at 6.4  kev",
    "gives an equivalent width ew@xmath3120  ev .    to study the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission , images in two different energy bands ( 25 kev and 510 kev ) were extracted .",
    "they show significantly different morphologies , with the hard emission with an elliptical shape elongated in the direction of the galactic plane , while the soft component shows a triangular shape , spatially correlated with the triangular halo of sgra  east .",
    "the fact that also the spectral data could be well described by a two  temperature model ( with kt@xmath33@xmath30.6 and kt@xmath34@xmath38  kev ) , can suggest that the sgra  complex diffuse emission may be explained in terms of two plasma components at different temperatures and with different spatial distributions . in this scenario , it is remarkable that the lower temperature plasma is well correlated with the sgr  a  east triangular radio halo , a likely evolved snr ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) .    from the spectral parameters of the soft component and the size of the sgra  east halo ( radius@xmath310 pc ) , an electron density n@xmath35@xmath33  @xmath36 and a pressure p@xmath33@xmath37  erg  @xmath36 can be calculated ( sidoli & mereghetti 1999 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the pressure p@xmath38@xmath34@xmath37  erg  @xmath36 derived for a snr in a sedov phase . in conclusion , if we assume that this thermal emission is mostly produced by the sgr  a  east halo , its x  ray luminosity , pressure , density , temperature of the emitting gas ( 0.6 kev ) and size ( @xmath320 pc ) , match well with a supernova remnant origin in which thermal line emission is produced when the expanding supernova explosion heats the ism to x  ray temperatures .",
    "three fields located on the galactic plane ( within about 200 pc from the gc ) , free from bright x  ray sources , have been studied ( sidoli 2000 ) .",
    "the mecs pointings considered here were centered on three molecular clouds complexes , sgr  b2 , sgr  c and sgr  c ( fig .  6 ) . the x  ray emission from these fields is harder than that coming from the sgr  a  complex , and displays weaker emission lines at low energy . on the other hand the fe lines around 67  kev are again particularly bright .",
    "an iron line at 6.4  kev is prominent in the spectrum from field n.  2 , due to fluorescent emission from the molecular cloud sgr  b2 .",
    "the dependence on the galactic longitude of the properties of the iron line diffuse emission are reported in figs .",
    "for comparison , also the parameters for the central pointing on sgr  a ( field n.1 ) are shown .",
    "the intensity ( fig .",
    "8) of the 6.7  kev iron line ( in the case of field n.  2 it is a blend of 6.7 and 6.4  kev lines ) shows a peak at the gc .",
    "field n.  2 displays an excess with respect to field n.  4 , located at the same galactocentric distance , due to the iron emission from sgr  b2 molecular cloud itself .    -0.7 truecm    1.1truecm    -0.6 truecm    1.1truecm    the spectra from the three fields have been fit with thermal plasma models , first with single temperature , then with two  temperature , due to soft excesses remaining when fitting with a single component model .",

    "counts have been extracted from within 8 arcmin from the pointing direction ; the cosmic background ( properly absorbed due to the low galactic latitude ) and the instrumental one have been subtracted .",
    "the spectra have been fit with a two  temperature plasma model ( mekal ) ; positive residuals emerging when fitting the spectrum from the field  2 require the addition of a gaussian line at 6.4  kev .",
    "all energies , ews and temperatures are in kev .",
    "e@xmath39 is the centroid of the emission line .",
    "the total flux i@xmath40 from the emission line is in units of 10@xmath41  photons  @xmath19  s@xmath8 .",
    "the hard components usually contribute about two third of the total luminosity",
    ". fluxes ( 210 kev range ) have been corrected for the interstellar absorption _ [ cols=\"^,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     the fact that the gc diffuse emission can be well fit with a two  temperature plasma model , suggests a comparison with the properties of the diffuse emission coming from other regions of the galactic plane .",
    "in fact , the galactic plane is permeated by a diffuse x  ray component ( the so  called galactic ridge emission ) with a two  temperature as well , kt@xmath33@xmath30.8",
    "kev and kt@xmath34@xmath38  kev ( asca observations of the scutum arm region ; kaneda et al .",
    "1997 ) .    while the hard components in the galactic ridge and in the gc display a similar temperature , the soft component coming from the gc shows a significantly lower temperature ( 0.20.4  kev ) with respect to the galactic ridge emission ( 0.8  kev ) .",
    "this discrepancy , other than to different physical conditions of the ism in the gc region , could be due to a higher interstellar absorption that makes quite uncertain the estimate of the parameters of the soft component in the gc direction .",
    "indeed , in the scutum arm both the less severe interstellar absorption and the larger band of the asca instruments ( 0.510 kev ) resulted in a more precise measurement of the temperature .",
    "another explanation can be a possible  contamination \" of the soft part of the spectra by emission physically related with the molecular clouds themselves .",
    "molecular clouds can emit x ",
    "rays in different ways . in several cases",
    "the emission is produced in the star forming regions naturally located inside the clouds ( e.g. koyama et al .",
    "main sequence stars are strong x  ray emitters ( up to 10@xmath42 erg  s@xmath8 ) with a large variety of behaviours , both with persistent thermal emission and with hard flares",
    ".    another possibility can be the emission from old isolated neutron stars ( ons ) accreting from the dense ism inside the molecular clouds ( treves & colpi 1991 ; zane , turolla & treves , 1996 ) .",
    "the spectrum emerging from such emission is indeed thermal and rather soft and could explain the lower soft temperature , with respect to the galactic ridge , of the fields containing molecular clouds . in this case , the x  ray luminosity contributed by a single ons depends on the density n@xmath43 of the molecular cloud and on the relative velocity v of the neutron star with respect to the accreting matter : l@xmath44",
    "n@xmath43  v@xmath45  erg  s@xmath8 , where v@xmath46 is the relative velocity in units of 10  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "assuming v@xmath4775100  km  s@xmath8 and n@xmath48  @xmath36 for a typical molecular cloud in the gc region , we get l@xmath49@xmath310@xmath50  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "the number of neutron star expected to reside in a single molecular cloud can be calculated from the stellar distribution as n@xmath51  pc@xmath52 , where r is the distance from the gc .",
    "assuming r@xmath3200  pc and a cloud volume v@xmath53  pc@xmath54 , n@xmath55  ns / cloud ; thus each cloud could contribute at a level of about @xmath56  erg  s@xmath8 to the luminosity of the soft component of the diffuse emission from the gc region .",
    "molecular clouds can also be the sites of reprocessing , scattering and reflection of hard photons from x  ray sources located inside or outside the clouds themselves .",
    "the strong x  ray emission in the 6.4  kev line from sgr  b2 has be explained by koyama et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and by sunyaev & churazov ( 1996 ) with the reflection of hard x ",
