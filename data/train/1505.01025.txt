    "condensation is the phenomenon whereby a finite fraction of some quantity , e.g. a particle density , concentrates into a small region of phase - space , as in the paradigmatic example of a vapor transforming into a liquid when crossing a phase - transition .",
    "condensation is observed in a number of different models , related to magnetic properties @xcite , gravity @xcite , mass transport and other issues @xcite . despite the prominent role played by molecular interactions in most cases",
    ", condensation can also be observed in _ non - interacting _ systems as , for instance , in a quantum bose - einstein condensate @xcite or in classical models such as the spherical model of a ferromagnet @xcite . in the above mentioned cases condensation",
    "occurs because the condensing quantity  the particle number in the former example or the spin variance in the latter  is conserved .",
    "this _ constraint _ acts like an _ effective _ interaction among the constituents bringing about the transition @xcite . indeed",
    ", condensation does not occur in a non - interacting boson gas  as in the case of photons  which does not conserve the number of constituents .",
    "a different manifestation of condensation is observed when probability distributions of a fluctuating collective variable @xmath2 , such as the number of particles in a thermodynamic system , are considered . in this case , a fluctuation @xmath3 well above the typical value can be associated to a condensed configuration of the system @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , referred to as _ condensation of fluctuations _",
    ", is not restricted to the particle number @xmath2 but was observed for quantities as diverse as energy , exchanged heats , particles currents etc ... @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in some systems condensation of fluctuations may occur because , from the mathematical point of view , asking for a specific value @xmath3 constraints the system similarly to what a conservation law does .    in this paper",
    "we study the probability distribution @xmath0 of the sum @xmath2 of @xmath4 non - identically distributed random variables .",
    "we discuss how an interpretation can be provided , along the guidelines of statistical mechanics , in terms of a phase - transition between a _",
    "normal _ phase with a vanishing order parameter @xmath5 and a condensed one with @xmath6 . a general expression for the probability @xmath0",
    "is found and the radically different behavior of this quantity in the normal and in the condensed phase are discussed and illustrated by comparing the analytical and numerical solution of some specific models . in particular , in the condensed phase , the notable phenomenon of the _ giant response _  a dramatic change of @xmath0 as the statistical properties of even a single random variable is modified  is pointed out .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ themodel ] we introduce the statistical model that will be studied and set the notation . in secs .",
    "[ thegas ] and [ theliquid ] its behavior is discussed when condensation does not occur and when it does , providing also an example by means of an analytically tractable case for identically distributed variables ( secs .",
    "[ exgas ] and [ exliquid ] , respectively ) . in sec .",
    "[ nonid ] the case of non identically distributed variables is addressed and the phenomenon of the _ giant response _ is discussed ( sec . [ giant ] ) .",

    "[ exnonid ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ theconclusions ] we briefly summarize and conclude the paper .",
    "in order to set the stage , let us consider the independent variables @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) subject to a probability @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a set of parameters .",
    "this probabilistic setup is suited to describe at a simple level a variety of systems ranging from physics to chemistry , biology and social sciences .",
    "for instance , one can consider @xmath4 receptors where @xmath1 ligand particles , like those of a pollutant , can be adsorbed , or @xmath1 electrons populating @xmath4 atomic levels .",
    "one can also think of @xmath4 individuals , or agents , collecting @xmath1 _ resources _ with a certain probability @xmath10 . in the former examples the temperature can be one of the control parameters @xmath9 but",
    ", in general , others can be present .",
    "we fix the language by speaking of @xmath4 _ receptors _ hosting a total number = _",
    "m=1^m n_m of _ particles _ , with an average value @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "for ease of notation the dependence on @xmath9 will be often dropped , and @xmath4 will be considered large .",
    "we are interested in the probability to observe a total number @xmath3 of particles @xmath13 } , \\label{prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for discrete variables , we used the representation @xmath14 , with q(z , m)= ^ and @xmath15 is the particles density .",
    "as explained in @xcite the probability distribution @xmath0 of the fluctuations of the particle number corresponds also to the partition function of a _ dual _ model where the number of particles is conserved .",
    "for example , with some particular choices of the microscopic probabilities @xmath16 that will be considered below , such dual model corresponds to specific instances of the so called urn model ( or balls in boxes model ) or of a zero - range process .",
    "this duality , which to the best of our knowledge was never discussed in connection to the above mentioned models , allows us to borrow a number of well established results in this research areas to illustrate the behavior of @xmath0  whose properties are here discussed in a rather large generality  in some exemplifying cases .",
    "the following relation holds @xcite p(n , m)=_n=0^n ( n , n , m ) [ recorp ] where ( n , n , m)=p(n - n , m-1)p_m(n ) [ force ] is the probability that , when the @xmath4-th _ receptor _ is added to the previous @xmath17 , @xmath18 particles are stored in it .",
    "( [ recorp ] ) is a recurrence relation allowing one to determine the probability distribution of @xmath4 variables once the one for @xmath17 is known .",
    "let us discuss the basic mechanisms whereby the recurrence ( [ recorp ] ) works to build up the full probability @xmath19 . denoting with @xmath20 the value of @xmath21 where @xmath0 is maximum , the largest @xmath22 in eq .",

    "( [ recorp ] ) only if @xmath24 .",
    "according to the previous discussion , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 has a maximum at a value @xmath27 which is microscopic and does not scale with @xmath4 ( see the inset of fig.[fig_pi ] for a specific example with @xmath28 , to be discussed below ) .",
    "this is so because the quantities @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) lower with @xmath18 ( i.e. moving away from the maximum ) and the same is true for @xmath29 , for sufficiently large @xmath30 ( being @xmath29 normalized ) .",
    "if the @xmath10 s are monotonously decreasing , it is @xmath31 .",
    "a similar setting , with @xmath26 peaked at a microscopic @xmath32 , is found also for @xmath33 , when the largest probability @xmath34 is contained in the sum on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ recorp ] ) , but its maximum is tamed by the microscopic probabilities , i.e. @xmath35 .    the situation with @xmath26 peaked in @xmath27 is physically intuitive : it expresses the fact that , when @xmath4 is large , the occupancy @xmath26 of the new receptor ( the @xmath4-th ) is microscopic .",
    "we will denote this situation , with a uniformly small occupation , the _ normal _ ( or _ gas _ ) phase .",
    "let us illustrate these behaviors by considering a specific example with power - law distribution p_m(n)=c ( n+1)^-k_m , [ zurns ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a normalization .",
    "we start with the simplest case where @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath39 @xcite . in the inset of fig.[fig_pi ] , @xmath26 is plotted for @xmath40 and different choices of @xmath21 . here",
    "one observes a sharp peak in @xmath41 , as expected .    in the _ gas _ phase",
    ", @xmath0 can be determined in the large-@xmath4 limit by a steepest - descent evaluation @xcite of the integral on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ prob ] ) , leading to p(n , m)e^-mr ( ) , [ rate ] with an @xmath4-independent rate - function r()=-q[z^*()]+z^ * ( ) , [ rrate ] where @xmath42 is given by the saddle - point equation z^*()=. [ saddle ]    for the specific example above , this equation can be cast as = + 1 , [ saddle1 ] where @xmath43 is the polylogarithm ( jonquire s function ) .",
    "it admits a solution with @xmath44 for any finite value of @xmath45 if @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "the quantity ( , m)=-p(m , m ) [ calr ] obtained from eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) by exact enumeration , is shown for different choices of @xmath4 .",
    "one observes that @xmath48 approaches the asymptotic @xmath4-independent form @xmath47 as @xmath4 is increased .",
    "notice that the convergence is faster at small densities .",
    "it must be recalled that , for @xmath49 , the average number @xmath50 of particles is not finite , meaning that in the large-@xmath4 limit fluctuations with large @xmath21 are very likely , as it is reflected by the vanishing of @xmath51 at large densities . however , for finite @xmath4 such large values of @xmath21 can not be sustained and @xmath48 , after reaching a minimum , raises again increasing @xmath52 , thus determining the existence of a most probable value of the fluctuations .",
    "the position of such value is pushed to larger densities by increasing @xmath4 , providing in this way a gradual convergence , from smaller to larger values of @xmath52 , of @xmath48 towards @xmath53 .",
    "a radically different situation occurs for @xmath33 , when @xmath34 grows fast enough to give @xmath54 . for the choice ( [ zurns ] ) with @xmath55",
    ", this happens when @xmath56 .    in this case",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ recorp ] ) does not only take contributions around the microscopic value @xmath32 , since @xmath57 can be non - negligible up to a certain @xmath58 of order @xmath4 .",
    "this is because @xmath26 is triggered by the maximum of @xmath22 at a value @xmath23 which , for given @xmath52 , is of order @xmath4 itself . usually @xmath0 is sharply peaked around the maximum as to give @xmath59 for @xmath21 sufficiently larger than @xmath60 .",
    "fig.[fig_pi ] shows this for the model ( [ zurns ] ) with @xmath61 : @xmath26 develops a second peak at @xmath62 and only for @xmath63 it drops down to negligible values .",
    "the properties of this second peak can be described using extreme - value statistics @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation is that , when a value of @xmath21 larger than the typical one @xmath60 is attempted , the occupancy of the new receptor @xmath4 can be either microscopic or macroscopic .",
    "then , together with the uniformly scarcely populated gas phase , a _ liquid _ , or _ condensed _",
    "phase coexists characterized by a single @xmath1 hosting a finite fraction of the @xmath21 particles .    from the previous considerations a close resemblance emerges with the problem of a gas - liquid transition , with @xmath21 being a control parameter playing the role of the volume , @xmath64 an order - parameter and @xmath65 an energetic landscape .",
    "notice that the amount of _ condensed _ vs _ normal _ fluctuations , described by @xmath66 , depends on @xmath21 : the fraction of condensate is absent at @xmath67 , and increases with @xmath21 .",
    "when condensation occurs eq .",

    "[ exnonid ] .",
    "a straightforward consequence of eq . ( [ secondsol2 ] ) is the phenomenon of the extreme sensitivity of the global probability @xmath0 to specific details of the microscopic ones @xmath10 , that we discuss below .",
    "it must be stressed that the solutions ( [ secondsol],[secondsol2 ] ) are totally different from the one ( [ rate ] ) , in particular concerning the dependence on @xmath4 .",

    "this shows that in the gas phase a shift of one ( or even of a finite number ) of the microscopic probabilities can not alter the global behavior of @xmath0 , since this is determined by the synergic contribution of a number @xmath109 of variables , the situation is profoundly different when condensation occurs . in this case",
    "@xmath0 is fully determined by the statistical properties of the most favorable receptor @xmath100 .",
    "therefore @xmath0 is independent of the form of all the other @xmath17 variables , whereas a macroscopic effect can be determined by altering the statistical properties of the single @xmath110 . as we will show by means of some examples in sec .",

    "this anomalous susceptibility is reminiscent of the large response induced by gapless modes @xcite , such as massless goldstone modes in systems with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry .",
    "actually , starting from equally distributed variables the symmetry between the receptors is broken by changing the properties of one of them .",
