    "the [ cii ] line is roughly 1500 times more intense than the co(@xmath17 ) rotational line in normal galaxies and galactic molecular clouds ; and 6300 times more intense than the co(@xmath18 ) line in starburst nuclei and galactic star formation regions ( crawford et al . , 1985 ,",
    "stacey et al . 1991 ) . for normal galaxy nuclei and star formation regions in the spiral arms ,",
    "most of the observed [ cii ] arises from pdrs on molecular cloud surfaces .",
    "however , integrated over the disks of normal spiral galaxies , a substantial fraction ( up to 50% ) may also arise from `` standard '' atomic clouds , i.e. the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) ( madden et al . 1993 ) or from extended , low density hii regions ( heiles 1994 ) .    with the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws , clegg et al .",

    "observations of fine structure atomic and ionic lines in the far - infrared have been obtained for half the sample of about 60 galaxies in the us - iso key project on normal galaxies .",

    "the galaxies were selected to have @xmath23 in fir emission using deconvolved iras maps .",
    "lws measures the total flux and not the brightness temperature so beam dilution is irrelevant .",

    "the data were reduced and calibrated with the iso pipelines olp4.2 to olp5.2 .",
    "the line profiles were derived from several scans by running a median boxcar filter through typically six spectral scans per object .",
    "we use the median of the observed fluxes instead of the mean to reduce the influence of outlying points arising from cosmic ray hits . the flux in the [ cii ] line",
    "was determined by directly integrating under the line .",
    "the upper limits on non - detections were derived by calculating the flux from a hypothetical gaussian line with an amplitude of @xmath5 and the effective instrumental profile , since the line is unresolved for all sources .",
    "the line fluxes suffer from calibration uncertainties mainly due to uncorrected fluctuations of detector responsivities with time . to estimate the calibration errors we compared the observed continuum levels at @xmath14 with flux predicted from dust emission models made using iras 100 and 60 @xmath0 fluxes ( helou & beichman 1990 ) .",
    "this comparison shows that the mean iso / iras continuum ratio at @xmath33 is about 1.1 and the observed fluxes lie within a factor of two of the models .",
    "these values are conservative estimates of the uncertainty in the line fluxes because the continuum levels , which are compared with iras flux densities , are affected by ill - determined dark currents ( additive in nature ) as well as detector responsivities ( multiplicative ) , whereas the line fluxes are affected only by the detector responsivities .",
    "thus we are confident of the trends in figure 1 which span a factor of @xmath34 in the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "the ratio of [ cii ] line to fir continuum flux from neutral gas depends on the efficiency of heating of gas by photoelectrons from dust , and is expected to be sensitive to the physical conditions in the ism .",
    "we therefore explore the dependence of @xmath1 on the dust temperature ( characterized by @xmath3 ) and global star - formation activity in galaxies ( characterized by @xmath4 ) .",
    "the two quantities , @xmath4 and @xmath3 are positively correlated with each other , i.e. galaxies with more active star - formation also have higher dust temperatures ( soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) .",
    "the present sample does not reflect this correlation as strongly as a randomly selected sample , as the galaxies were selected to span the parameter space in @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in figure 1 the quantity log(@xmath1 )",
    "is plotted as a function of the ratio of fir and b - band luminosity @xmath4 of the galaxies , and as a function of flux density ratio at 60 and 100 @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "three main results emerge from figure 1 , and are discussed in the next three subsections .",
    "3=    3 = 3.3 in      about two - thirds of the galaxies ( 19 out of 30 ) have @xmath1 ratio between 0.2 - 0.7% ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value measured for the milky way , and both normal and starburst galaxies ( stacey et al .",

    "1991 , stacey et al .",
    "1991 , madden et al .",
    "1993 , lord et al .",
    "these observed ratios are well understood in terms of pdr models ( th85 , wth90 ) .",
    "the [ cii ] line originates from warm neutral gas in the photodissociation regions .",
    "the efficiency of the photoelectric heating of gas is a fraction of a percent . in the data presented in this paper",
    "we see a confirmation of this model in galaxies spanning a range of morphologies , with dust temperatures and @xmath4 ratios which are not unusually high .",
    "about 1/3 of the present sample with higher fir / blue luminosity and warmer far - infrared colors ( i.e. higher @xmath3 ratio ) show a trend of decreasing @xmath1 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "such a trend is also seen within our galaxy ( nakagawa et al .",
    "1995 , bennett et al .",
    "the trends in @xmath1 with @xmath4 and with @xmath3 could be due to the following .",
    "( any reference to the trends refers only to the one - third of the sample with warm fir colors which shows decreasing @xmath1 with @xmath4 and with @xmath3 )    \\(a ) for high ratios of uv flux to gas density ( @xmath35 ) , the dust grains are positively charged and are less efficient at heating the gas because the potential barrier to photoejection is higher ( th85 ) .",
    "this leads to smaller pdr line to dust continuum ratios because , most of the uv energy is absorbed and reradiated in the fir by grains , and a smaller fraction of the uv energy goes into gas heating , so the gas requires less cooling .",
    "\\(b ) at densities of @xmath36 @xmath37 ions become collisionally de - excited ( th85 , wth90 ) and an increasing amount of cooling is done through other channels ; for example , the [ oi ] line at @xmath38 .",
    "we see that this line can not compensate completely for the decrease of @xmath1 in figure 1 , as the observed [ oi](@xmath38 ) line flux does not exceed @xmath39[cii ] in this sample , whereas the ratio @xmath1 varies by a factor of 40 .",
    "co and ci lines can also cool the gas .",
    "\\(c ) in each galaxy we measure the total fir and the total [ cii ] line emission arising from a collection of hii regions , pdrs , and diffuse atomic clouds .",
    "galactic hii regions like w  51 and s  140 have smaller @xmath1 ratios compared to typical pdrs ( emery et al .",
    "a varying mix of these components will lead to variations in the @xmath1 ratio seen in figure 1 .      in the extreme cases of ngc  4418 , ic  0860 and cgcg  1510.8 + 0725 , [ cii ] emission is undetected at the @xmath5 level of @xmath40 .",
    "emission in the other prominent pdr cooling line [ oi ] at @xmath38 is undetected at similar levels , as are [ oiii ] ( @xmath41 ) and [ nii ] ( @xmath42 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show @xmath5 upper limits on the flux in the [ cii ] @xmath14 transition .",
    "the absence of [ cii ] emission in these galaxies is very striking because the upper limits on the @xmath1 in these galaxies are up to 40 times smaller than the narrow range in @xmath1 measured for two - thirds of the sample .",
    "yet these galaxies have normal atomic and molecular gas components .",
    "a comparable upper limit on @xmath1 was reported by stacey et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for the ir luminous galaxy ngc  660 .",
    "luhman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also report on weak [ cii ] emission from ultraluminous galaxies .    in order to understand the absence of the [ cii ] cooling line ,",
    "let us review what is distinct about these three galaxies .",
    "they have among the highest @xmath43 luminosity ratio and dust temperature @xmath3 in the sample , but are not ultraluminous ir sources .",
    "their fir luminosities vary from log(@xmath44)=10.05 - 10.24 .",
    "the mid - infrared images at 7 and 15 @xmath0 are unresolved at @xmath45 resolution of isocam ( silbermann et al .",
    "1997 ) and they are compact in radio continuum at 1.4 ghz ( condon et al 1990 ) : ngc  4418 measures @xmath46 , cgcg  1510.8 + 0725 measures @xmath47 and ic  860 @xmath48 . two other galaxies in the present sample , ngc  3620 and iras  f10565 + 2448 , have comparable fir / blue luminosity and @xmath3 but do show weak [ cii ] emission lines .",
    "ngc  3620 is not compact in mid - ir emission and iras  f10565 + 2448 is a point source at high redshift in the sample , so the size limits are less stringent ( the size @xmath49 kpc ) .",
    "cgcg  1510.8 + 0725 shows a broad h@xmath50 line indicative of a seyfert nucleus ( kim et al .",
    "1995 ) but no h@xmath51 , ( possibly due to obscuration ) , causing it to be classified as a hii galaxy ( veilleux et al .",
    "ngc  4418 shows many indications of being a hidden seyfert nucleus ( roche et al .",
    "1986 , kawara , nishida & philips 1989 ) , and has the distinction of having the most extinguished nucleus with @xmath52 ( roche et al .",
    "1986 ) as seen in the @xmath53 absorption feature .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the [ cii ] deficiency in these three systems .",
    "\\(a ) for high ratios of uv radiation to density of the warm gas ( @xmath35 ) , the dust grains are positively charged and are less efficient at heating the gas ( th85 ) .",
    "this is also a likely explanation for the trend of decreasing @xmath1 discussed in section 3.2(a ) .",
    "wolfire et al .",
    "( 1990 ) predict @xmath54})/\\ffir < 10^{-4}$ ] for @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "a high @xmath35 can come about in low density or high radiation regions . co observations of these galaxies show copious , compact , circumnuclear gas ( planesas , mirabel & sanders 1991 , kwara et al .",
    "this indicates that even though the density of the gas @xmath55 is high , @xmath35 is higher .",
    "\\(b ) the addition of a compact fir source in the nucleus of galaxies , e.g. an obscured agn , can lead to both a higher fir / blue luminosity ratio and a lower @xmath1 ratio .",
    "this possibility is supported by the compact appearance of the mid - ir and radio continuum emission in these three galaxies .",
    "a buried agn could produce a lot of fir without much [ cii ] since the uv field will be inefficient at making [ cii ] both due to its hardness ( higher ionization states for c will be common ) and due to its strength ( inefficiency of heating gas as discussed in point ( a ) ) .",
    "\\(c ) the [ cii ] line may be optically thick or the lines may be weak due to self - absorption by lower excitation @xmath11 foreground gas .",
    "such self - absorption is seen in the @xmath14 line observed at high resolution ( boreiko & betz 1997 ) .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the compactness of the mid - ir emission in the three galaxies .",
    "the [ cii ] line becomes optically thick at @xmath56@xmath57 for a velocity width of 4 @xmath58 ( russell et al .",
    "assuming a velocity width of @xmath59 for ngc 4418 ( sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ) and @xmath60 , optical depth of one in the [ cii ] line is reached for column densities of @xmath61 @xmath57 .",
    "roche et al .",
    "( 1986 ) estimate the visual extinction towards the nucleus of ngc  4418 to be @xmath62 .",
    "if the pdr gas has @xmath63 it will contribute @xmath64 .",
    "this high a pdr contribution to the extinction would imply a high ratio of pdr to cold molecular gas , instead of the conventional picture where pdrs form a thin surface layer of molecular clouds .",
    "since atomic oxygen is found in abundance in dark clouds the non - detection of the [ oi ] @xmath38 line could easily be due to self - absorption as well ( poglitsch et al . 1996 , kraemer , jackson & lane , 1996 ) .",
    "compact concentrations of circumnuclear molecular gas in cgcg  1510.8 + 0725 and ngc  4418 ( planesas , mirabel & sanders 1991 , kwara et al.1990 ) further support the scenario where the cii line is at high optical depth or self - absorbed .",
    "\\(d ) the dominant pdr cooling lines [ cii ] and [ oi ] could be weak or missing if most of the fir emission is from dust in high density hii regions ( c.f .",
    "point ( c ) in section 3.2 ) .",
    "this hypothesis is disfavored because the dust temperatures derived from the continuum shapes are too low compared to hii regions in the milky way ( e.g. s140 , emery et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "\\(e ) an aging starburst , and a weak uv field relative to a softer , optical / infrared field which heats the dust , is used to explain the [ cii ] line weakness in the galactic center ( nakagawa et al .",
    "this mechanism seems unlikely because the [ cii ] deficiency is systematically found in galaxies with warmer fir colors and higher @xmath4 ratios indicating younger starbursts , with the hotter dust pointing to the presence of massive stars and uv photons .",
    "three main results emerge in this study of [ cii ] fine structure transition at @xmath14 , a primary coolant of photodissociation regions in star - forming galaxies .",
    "\\(1 ) about two - thirds of the observed galaxies show a ratio of @xmath65 .",
    "this is consistent with the models and efficiencies of heating of pdr gas by photoelectrons from dust grains illuminated by moderate uv fluxes .",
    "\\(2 ) as the dust temperature and the star - formation rate in galaxies increase , the ratio of @xmath1 decreases .",
    "this is probably due to higher uv radiation fields in warmer galaxies causing dust grains to become positively charged , thus leading to a decrease in gas heating efficiency of photoelectrons from dust grains .",
    "this effect is seen in the warmer one - third of the sample .",
    "\\(3 ) in the present sample there are three galaxies near the extreme end of this trend in the @xmath3 ratio and in the ratio of @xmath4 which show no detectable line emission in the [ cii ] and [ oi ] lines .",
    "since the upper limits on @xmath1 for the three galaxies is 10 - 40 times smaller than the @xmath1 observed for most galaxies , we conclude that less than @xmath66 of the fir emission in these galaxies arises from the typical pdr gas having moderate uv fluxes .",
    "upper limits on the [ cii ] line flux in the three galaxies with no detection are not very far from the trend of decreasing @xmath1 with increasing star - formation activity and dust temperature . in our preferred scenario , both",
    "the trend in figure 1 and the absence of pdr lines in the extreme galaxies can be naturally explained by a trend of increasing @xmath35 in the hotter , more active galaxies , and hence a lower efficiency of gas heating . a large contribution to the fir flux by an active nucleus or dense hii regions",
    "could explain the absence of [ cii ] lines but not easily the trends in @xmath1 .",
    "the other scenarios where the absence of [ cii ] line is due to optically thick conditions , self - absorption or collisional de - excitation are not ruled out by the present data but other cooling channels for the gas need to be identified .",
    "the [ cii ] line at @xmath14 has been used as a measure of star - formation activity ( at least of massive stars ) ( e.g. stacey et al .",
    "these iso - lws data allow us to probe the variations in the line strength and how sensitive they are to the physical conditions in the ism .",
    "if the variations observed in this study are mostly due to agn , then the [ cii ] line strength and its ratio to @xmath67 is mostly a diagnostic of whether the fir luminosity of any given source is due to star - formation or active nucleus .",
    "however , if the decreasing @xmath68 is caused by increasing @xmath35 , then these iso - lws data allow us to probe the interplay between star formation and physical conditions in the ism .",
    "this work was supported by iso data analysis funding from the us national aeronautics and space administration , and carried out at the infrared processing and analysis center and the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology .",

    "<S> . the low @xmath1 could also be due to either weak [ cii ] because of self - absorption or strong fir continuum from regions weak in [ cii ] , such as dense hii regions or plasma ionized by hard radiation of agns . </S>",
