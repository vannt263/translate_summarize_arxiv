    "as discussed in the text , it is sufficient to prove that all dark eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath122 have a maximally symmetric spin wavefunction . to understand the properties of its dark eigenstates under particle exchange",
    ", we will actually work in first quantization writing an eigenstate for @xmath27 particles as @xmath123 here the @xmath124 component of the vector @xmath125 , @xmath126 , labels the spin orientation of the @xmath124 particle ( along some arbitrary quantization axis , which we ll call @xmath33 ) , and the total spin wavefunction in any term of the sum is @xmath127 the sum over @xmath125 should be understood as independent summations over each index @xmath128 the coefficients @xmath129 are arbitrary , and @xmath130 is a normalized orbital wavefunction for the @xmath27 particles .",
    "dark states of @xmath3-wave losses have zero expectation value in the interaction operator @xmath131 and this expectation value can be evaluated as @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "the last equality holds because the interaction is spin - independent .",
    "it is crucial to realize that the operator @xmath134 is positive - semidefinite , which means that satisfying @xmath135 actually implies the stricter constraint @xmath136 in addition to the operator @xmath134 being positive - semidefinite , the constituent pairwise interaction operators are as well .",
    "hence , the condition @xmath137 actually implies that @xmath138 the above set of equalities can now be used to pin down properties regarding the exchange symmetry of the wave functions @xmath130 .",
    "let s choose two particles , say particle 1 and particle 2 , and define relative and center - of - mass coordinates for them as @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we can then expand the wavefunction @xmath130 in a way that makes the symmetrization with respect to exchange of particles 1 and 2 explicit : @xmath141 in the above @xmath45 are harmonic oscillator wavefunctions , the @xmath142 are a complete and orthonormal set of eigenfunctions for the remaining @xmath143 particles , and the notation @xmath144 implies that the relative wavefunction of particles 1 and 2 is uniquely determined by @xmath145 and @xmath3 .",
    "this point is crucial , and relies on the observation that for @xmath146 to be an eigenstate , when expanded in terms of eigenstates @xmath147 all of the eigenstates must have the same eigenvalue .",
    "hence the energies of states @xmath148 , @xmath145 , and @xmath3 are constrained to add to some fixed value . from now on we ll drop this explicit dependence . the interaction energy between particles 1 and 2 is given by @xmath149 and hence @xmath150 implies that @xmath151 so @xmath152 must be zero for all even wave functions ( all of which are finite at the origin ) , implying that @xmath130 is strictly odd under interchange of particles 1 and 2 . by repeating the above argument for two arbitrary particles @xmath19 and @xmath37 , it is easy to see that @xmath130 is strictly odd under interchange of _ any _ two particles .",
    "we can now ask what the antisymmetry of @xmath130 implies for the full wave function @xmath153 under interchange of two arbitrary particles we have @xmath154 , and we obtain the new wave function @xmath155 implying that @xmath156 the second equality follows because switching @xmath157 in the summand just changes the order of the terms in the sum , and the third equality follows from the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction under particle exchange . by repeated permutations of various particles , this chain of logic can be used to demonstrate that all of the @xmath158 are equal , and hence we have @xmath159 now @xmath160 is just some normalization , which is related to the total @xmath33 projection of the spin , and it is clear that @xmath146 breaks up into the product of a completely antisymmetric orbital wavefunction multiplied by a completely symmetric spin wavefunction .",
    "in order to estimate the phase measurement sensitivity of an array of 1d tubes in the steady state , we begin by considering just the @xmath124 tube , with initial particle number @xmath27 , final particle number @xmath105 after relaxing to steady state via collisional loss , and initial ( and final ) spin projection @xmath107 .",
    "the initial @xmath27 atoms can most easily be prepared in an incoherent mixture of spin up and spin down by simply allowing a coherent state initially prepared along the @xmath161-direction to undergo single particle dephasing ( which could be briefly enhanced via a myriad of methods ) . for the coherent state ,",
    "the probability of a given @xmath107 is given by a binomial distribution , which for large @xmath27 is approximated by the continuous probability distribution @xmath162 note that without dephasing into a mixture , a coherent state of fermions does not undergo @xmath3-wave collisions . in the sense that such a distribution is easily prepared experimentally , we take this to be a worst - case scenario ; a distribution of @xmath107 more sharply peaked around @xmath163 will enhance the phase sensitivity .",
    "the probability distribution of steady - state particle numbers in the @xmath124 tube , conditioned on a particular value of @xmath107 , is given by @xmath164 for @xmath163 , this distribution is peaked around @xmath106 ( giving the expected value of @xmath165 quoted in the text ) . for @xmath166 ,",
    "the step function @xmath167 reflects the fact that as particles are lost ( remember that @xmath107 is conserved by the losses ) , the remaining particles are maximally spin polarized once @xmath168 .",
    "the second exponential provides the proper normalization , @xmath169 , where the factor of @xmath9 comes from converting sums into integrals while respecting our assumption of even particle number .    for this single tube , small rotations about the @xmath161-axis by an angle @xmath170 cause a standard deviation in the final distribution of @xmath107 given by @xcite @xmath171 for large @xmath105 . for @xmath163 ( before the rotation )",
    ", this demonstrates that a discrepancy in @xmath107 ( after the rotation ) of order unity is expected for @xmath172 , hence the heisenberg limited phase - sensitivity within a single tube .",
    "our estimation of the phase sensitivity for an array of tubes relies only on the assumption that the _ initial _",
    "( i.e. before the losses ) value of @xmath173 is known to within an uncertainty @xmath174 , but does not require any knowledge of @xmath107 in the individual tubes , greatly relaxing the experimental requirements .",
    "this uncertainty @xmath174 guarantees that , in principle , rotations causing deviations in @xmath34 of order @xmath174 can be detected . for @xmath94 tubes with",
    "well defined ( i.e. measured ) total spin projection @xmath34 , the expected standard deviation in @xmath34 ( denoted @xmath175 ) due to a rotation by angle @xmath176 about the @xmath161-axis satisfies      here @xmath178 is the dirac @xmath178-function , reflecting the correlations established between the various @xmath107 by the knowledge of @xmath34 , and the factors of @xmath9 again come from converting sums into integrals while respecting the assumption of even particle number . if we ignore this @xmath178-function constraint , which is valid in the large @xmath94 limit , the integral simplifies greatly to @xmath179 equation ( [ stotvar ] ) can be evaluated explicitly to reveal @xmath180 setting the total standard deviation to @xmath174 gives a minimum phase sensitivity of @xmath181 as has been demonstrated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath182 is possible for @xmath112 atoms in an optical cavity , as long as measurements that do not preserve coherence between the atoms are acceptable .",
    "such measurements certainly are acceptable before the losses take place , since we require no inter - particle correlations in the initial state ( they develop dynamically due to the losses ) .",
    "therefore , as quoted in the manuscript , we expect a minimum phase sensitivity of @xmath183 to be achievable in experiment ."

    "<S> @xcite ) , and even faster for @xmath120yb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more quantitative analysis of the effects of both magnetic field imperfections and finite @xmath4-wave losses requires numerical simulations beyond the scope of this work , and is left for future study .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_. in this paper we have demonstrated that fairly unrestrictive initial conditions , without intervention or engineering and in the presence of reactive two - body collisions , are sufficient to generate steady - state spin entanglement between non - degenerate fermions . </S>",
    "<S> these reactive collisions , which occur both in optically excited alkaline earth atoms and many dipolar molecules ( e.g. krb ) , are typically viewed as an impediment to interesting physics , but clearly this need not be the case . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this physics to enable the distillation of dicke states from initially uncorrelated fermionic atoms and molecules , hence extending the scope of a variety of experimental progress made in the spin squeezing of bosons .    </S>",
