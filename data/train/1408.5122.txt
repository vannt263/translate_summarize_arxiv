    "we let @xmath8 be the maximum rate that we leave a state .",
    "next , @xmath9 yields a continuous time markov process on @xmath2 called _ the noisy voter model with voting mechanism @xmath9 _ ( often abbreviated _ the noisy voter model _ ) where , independently , ( 1 ) for each two sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the state at site @xmath3 changes to the value of the state at site @xmath4 at rate @xmath5 , and ( 2 ) each site rerandomizes its state at rate 1 . by",
    "_ rerandomizes _",
    ", we mean that the state at that site switches to 1 or 0 , each with probability @xmath10 , independently of everything else .",
    "the noisy voter model was introduced by granovsky and madras @xcite . denoting an element of @xmath2 by @xmath11",
    ", one can describe this dynamic in the following way : independently at each @xmath12 , @xmath13 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & 1 \\to 0 \\mbox { at rate } \\frac{1}2 + \\sum_{y\\ne x}q(x , y ) \\bigl(1-\\eta(y)\\bigr ) \\qquad\\mbox{if } \\eta(x)=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    observe that whether or not @xmath9 is irreducible , the corresponding noisy voter model is clearly irreducible and hence has a unique stationary distribution .",
    "if there were no rerandomization , this would simply be the ordinary voter model associated to @xmath14 , which has , in the case where @xmath14 is irreducible , two absorbing states , all 0 s and all 1 s .",
    "on the other hand , if there were no voter mechanism [ essentially meaning that @xmath15 for all @xmath3 and @xmath4 ] , then the model would simply be continuous time random walk on the hypercube .    throughout this paper ,",
    "given @xmath14 , we let @xmath17 denote the corresponding noisy voter model , @xmath18 denote its stationary distribution and @xmath19 denote the law of @xmath20 when @xmath21 . (",
    "the dependence of these on @xmath14 is implicit . )",
    "if we have a sequence of such systems , we let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote these objects for the @xmath25th system .",
    "recall that the total variation distance between two probability measures @xmath26 and @xmath27 on a finite set @xmath28 is defined to be @xmath29    next , given a noisy voter model , for @xmath30 , we let @xmath31 denote the @xmath32-mixing time .    the main theorem of the paper is the following .",
    "[ thmm : main1 ] assume that we have a sequence @xmath33 of continuous time markov chains with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "assume further that there is @xmath36 such that for each @xmath25 , there is a stationary distribution for @xmath33 where the ratio of the largest and smallest point masses is at most @xmath36 .",
    "( this holds , e.g. , in any transitive situation . )",
    "then , for each @xmath32 , @xmath37    moreover , we have that @xmath38 where * 1 * denotes the configuration of all 1 s and @xmath39    we will see that  ( [ eq : main2 ] ) holds in fact whenever @xmath40 , and therefore the upper bound  ( [ eq : mainmixing ] ) also holds under this assumption .    theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] tells us that under the given conditions , the mixing time is of order @xmath41 and that there is a cutoff with a window of size of order 1 .",
    "( we define mixing times and cutoff in section  [ s.background ] below . )",
    "these assumptions are necessary .",
    "clearly if there is no bound on @xmath42 , then the mixing time can easily be made to be of order 1 .",
    "more interestingly , even if @xmath42 is bounded , ( [ eq : main1 ] ) is not necessarily true without some condition on the set of stationary distributions .",
    "an example of this is continuous time random walk on the _ @xmath25-star _ , which is the graph that has one vertex with @xmath25 edges emanating from it .",
    "( by _ continuous time random walk on a graph _ , we mean that the walker waits an exponential time and then chooses a neighbor at random . ) this will be explained in section  [ s.wheel ] .",
    "we also mention that it is easy to see that the condition involving the set of stationary distributions is not necessary in order for  ( [ eq : main1 ] ) and ( [ eq : main2 ] ) to hold since one could take @xmath42 going to 0 sufficiently quickly so that the voter mechanism never comes into play .",
    "we mention that it was proved by ramadas @xcite that when randomization occurs at any rate @xmath43 , the mixing time for the noisy voter model on any graph with @xmath25 vertices is @xmath44 .",
    "theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] has an interesting consequence for the stochastic ising model on cycles .",
    "the ising model on any graph @xmath45 with parameter ( inverse temperature ) @xmath46 is the probability measure on @xmath47 which gives , up to a normalization factor , probability @xmath48 to configuration @xmath49 .",
    "the stochastic ising model on @xmath50 with _ heat - bath _ dynamics is the continuous time markov chain on @xmath47 where each site at rate 1 erases its present state and chooses to be in state @xmath51 or 1 , according to the conditional distribution for the ising model , given the other states at that time .",
    "for the case @xmath52 , lubetzky and sly ( see @xcite ) proved that for @xmath53 and all @xmath54 , @xmath55 and all @xmath54 below the critical value and @xmath56 and all @xmath54 sufficiently small , one has cutoff at some constant times @xmath57 with a window of order @xmath58 . in @xcite , lubetzky and sly",
    "improved and extended these results in a number of directions ; in particular , they proved that the result holds for all @xmath54 below the critical value in all dimensions and that the window above can be taken to be of order 1 . while the arguments in this second paper are somehow easier , they are still quite involved , including that for @xmath53 .",
    "interestingly , for the cycle @xmath59 , the stochastic ising model and the noisy voter model ( where one performs random walk on @xmath59 ) turn out to be the same model , and hence the special case of theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] for random walk on the cycle is already known . in this special case , the stochastic ising model corresponds to the dynamics where independently at each @xmath60 , the rate at which @xmath61 flips to @xmath62 is @xmath63 \\bigr ) \\bigr]^{-1}.\\ ] ] an easy calculation , which we will leave to the reader , shows that if we consider the noisy voter model on the cycle with @xmath64 and multiply time by @xmath65 , we obtain the above stochastic ising model . while the work of lubetzky and sly implies theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] for the cycle ( and also yields some further results ) , the proof given here turns out to be easier .",
    "mossel and schoenebeck @xcite consider a similar type of voting model where there is no noise and study , among other things , the time it takes to become absorbed",
    ". here , properly related to our model , they show an upper bound of order @xmath66 which would be the correct order for the cycle .",
    "we see , from the last part of theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] , a drastic change when even small noise is introduced into the system since now it takes only order @xmath67 to reach equilibrium . on a related note , mossel and tamuz @xcite provide a fascinating survey of various `` opinion exchange dynamics . ''",
    "earlier , we mentioned the @xmath25-star as providing a counterexample to ( [ eq : main1 ] ) when there is no condition imposed on the stationary distributions .",
    "the noisy voter model on the @xmath25-star has an additional fascinating feature .",
    "[ thmm : wheel ] consider the noisy voter model corresponding to continuous time random walk with parameter 1 on the @xmath25-star with @xmath25 even :    let @xmath68 denote any configuration which is 1 on exactly half of the leaves . if @xmath69 and @xmath70 , then @xmath71    the time it takes for the distribution starting from all 1 s to be within distance @xmath72 in total variation norm from the stationary distribution is @xmath73 .",
    "this is quite surprising since one typically expects that for monotone systems , the mixing time for the system should be governed by the time it takes the two extremal states to become close in total variation norm .",
    "we end this with a brief description of the results obtainable for a natural version of a discrete time noisy voter model .",
    "the input for such a model is a discrete time markov chain on a finite set @xmath1 and a parameter @xmath74 $ ] . given these , the model is defined by first choosing an @xmath3 in @xmath1 uniformly at random , and then with probability @xmath75 , one selects @xmath4 with probability @xmath76 , at which point the state of @xmath3 changes to the state of @xmath4 , while with probability @xmath77 , the state at vertex @xmath3 is rerandomized to be 0 or 1 , each with probability @xmath10 .",
    "discrete time analogues of  ( [ eq : main1 ] ) [ and  ( [ eq : main1finite ] ) later on ] can easily be obtained with the exact same methods we use below .",
    "the mixing times , however , will now be at time latexmath:[$\\frac{|s|\\log    rerandomizing with probability @xmath77 . similarly , a  discrete time analogue of  ( [ eq : wheel1 ] ) can be obtained when , for example , @xmath79 ; here the relevant time will be @xmath80 .",
    "the connection with the ising model holds exactly when moving to discrete time , but then one must consider the discrete time version of the ising model .",
    "the paper by chen and saloff - coste ( see @xcite ) contains various results which allow one to transfer between a discrete time model and its continuous time version ( where updates are done at the times of a poisson process ) .",
    "in particular , proposition  3.2(2 ) in this paper allows us to obtain a discrete time analogue of  ( [ eq : main2 ] ) ( with time scaled again by @xmath81 ) _ from _ the continuous time version of this result .",
    "finally a discrete time analogue of theorem  [ thmm : wheel](ii ) with the @xmath73 term being replaced by an @xmath82 term can be obtained ; this is done by modifying the proof of theorem  20.3(ii ) in @xcite to obtain a discrete time version of lemma  [ lemma.reducedwheel ] from the continuous time version of this lemma .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s.background ] , we briefly recall some standard definitions concerning mixing times and cutoff as well as introduce some notation . in section  [ s.thmproof ]",
    "we prove a stronger version of theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] , namely theorem  [ thmm : main1again ] .",
    "the coalescing markov chain descriptions of both the voter model and the noisy voter model are important tools in its analysis . however , in this paper , we only need these tools for the proof of the last statement of theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] or equivalently for theorem  [ thmm : main1again](ii ) ( as well as in the first remark in section  [ s.wheel ] ) , and therefore these descriptions are discussed only at those points in the paper .",
    "finally , theorem  [ thmm : wheel ] is proved in section  [ s.wheel ] .",

    "( the difference of @xmath99 and @xmath100 here is simply due to the fact that continuous time random walk with rate 1 on the hypercube of dimension @xmath25 has each coordinate changing its state at rate 1 rather than rerandomizing at rate 1 . )",
    "we point out that in most cases where cutoff is proved , the chain is reversible , while theorem  [ thmm : main1 ] provides for us a large class of nonreversible chains .",

    "the rest of the section is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thmm : wheel ] .",
    "proof of theorem  [ thmm : wheel ] we begin with ( i ) .",

    "we can now apply equation ( 13.9 ) from section  13.2 of @xcite to this discrete time markov chain with @xmath86 being @xmath304 , @xmath3 being the configuration @xmath305 ( whose corresponding @xmath123 value is @xmath297 ) and @xmath131 being @xmath306 .",
    "after simplification [ and recalling that our continuous time system at time @xmath307 is the discrete time system at time @xmath304 ] we get  ( [ eq : wheel1 ] ) .    for ( ii ) , note first that , in the terminology introduced in section  [ s.background ] , we want to show that @xmath309 .",
    "we first note that by symmetry , if we only look at the state of the center of the star and the number of leaves which are in state 1 , then this is also a markov chain .",

    "one proceeds as follows . keeping symmetry in mind",
    ", we can generate a realization of the configuration at time @xmath86 starting from all 1 s by considering the reduced system at time @xmath86 starting from @xmath312 , and if the reduced system is in state @xmath313 , we then construct a configuration for the full system by letting the center be in state @xmath314 and choosing a uniform random subset of size @xmath315 from the @xmath25 leaves to be in state 1 and the rest to be in state 0 .",

    "therefore , by an obvious coupling , we have that the total variation distance between the full system at time @xmath86 started from @xmath130 and the stationary distribution for the full system is exactly the total variation distance between the reduced system at time @xmath86 started from @xmath312 and the stationary distribution for the reduced system .",
    "now the proposition follows from lemma  [ lemma.reducedwheel ] .",
    "[ lemma.reducedwheel ] the mixing times for @xmath316 is o(1 ) .",
    "observe that the infinitesimal rates for this reduced chain are as follows : @xmath317 we denote this reduced system by @xmath318 where @xmath25 is suppressed in the notation .",
