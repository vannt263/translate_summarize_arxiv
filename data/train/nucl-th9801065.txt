    "in the past years a considerable amount of work has been done both in the experimental  ( @xcite-@xcite ) and the theoretical  ( @xcite-@xcite ) aspects of the physics of single and double@xmath2 hypernuclei ( for a general overview see the proceedings of the most recent _ international conferences on hypernuclear and strange particle physics _",
    "@xcite ) .    up to now",
    ", the experimental community has reported the existence and has measured the @xmath0 ground state ( angular momentum and spin of the two interacting @xmath11 s coupled to zero , @xmath12 ) binding energy of three double@xmath2 hypernucleibe or @xmath5b , resulting , respectively , in a repulsive or attractive @xmath1 interaction .",
    "however , the theoretical analysis of yamamoto et .",
    "@xcite and dover et .",
    "@xcite helped to discard the possibility of @xmath4be , and thus it is commonly accepted an attractive nature for the @xmath1 interaction . ] : @xmath3he , @xmath4be and @xmath5b which energies are reported in table  [ tab : bll ] .",
    "let us consider the hypernucleus @xmath13 , composed of a nuclear core @xmath14 and two bound @xmath11 particles .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is defined as the total binding energy ( @xmath16 ) of the double@xmath2 hypernucleus , and thus it is given by @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the mass of the system which appears inside the brackets and @xmath19 ( 1115.6 mev ) is the @xmath11 mass . to learn about the nature of the @xmath1 interaction , it is usual to define the magnitude @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath16 ) , given by @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the binding energy of a hyperon @xmath11 in the hypernucleus @xmath24 . neglecting saturation effects ,",
    "@xmath20 is suppressed with respect to @xmath15 by one power of the nuclear mass number .",
    ".experimental double@xmath2 hypernuclei binding energies , @xmath25 , and values for the quantity @xmath26 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltabll ] ) . as it is discussed with great detail in  @xcite",
    ", we have considered that the event reported by  @xcite corresponds to the double@xmath2 hypernucleus @xmath27b .",
    "we use the notation @xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     preliminary results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the @xmath1 interaction in the medium , @xmath28 , is more attractive than that in the free space , @xmath29 .",
    "variational results ( our best results ) provide effective interactions unable to bind the @xmath1 pair in the @xmath0 channel",
    ". therefore we can discard the existence of @xmath1 bound states in the free space when only the @xmath1 diagonal element , @xmath29 , of the @xmath8 potential is considered .",
    "an independent confirmation of the no existence of @xmath1 bound states is given by the @xmath30coupling ( @xmath31 = 2.138 ) extracted from the study of hyperon - nucleon scattering processes which is well below of any of the @xmath30couplings quoted in table  [ tab : bound ] .",
    "however , the @xmath8 coupling , though likely suppresed in the nuclear medium , might contribute significantly in the free space . in the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of the above coupling leads to more attractive interactions in the @xmath32 sector , allowing for values of the @xmath1 @xmath0 free space scattering length as large as that of the @xmath33 system .",
    "thus , to draw any firm conclusion about the existence of bound states in the @xmath32 baryon - baryon sector , a combined studied of the @xmath1 and @xmath34 systems is needed .",
    "we would like to stress that the important issue now is to clarify whether or not the difference between the @xmath31 values of 2.138 ( obtained from hyperon - nucleon scattering data in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and of 2.85 ( obtained in this work for @xmath35 and @xmath36 1 gev within the var scheme and cutoff @xmath37 correspond to those used in ref .",
    "] ) can be explained in terms of medium renormalization effects and/or the contribution of @xmath34 intermediate states to the induced interaction @xmath28 and/or the contribution of heavier mesons not included here , such as the @xmath38 meson . as discussed in subsect .",
    "[ sec : phi ] , the inclusion of the @xmath39exchange piece of the @xmath1 potential reduces in some extent the difference between the @xmath40 couplings mentioned above . for instance , if a @xmath41 cutoff of 2.5 gev is used , one finds values for @xmath31 of the order of 2.6 ( table  [ tab : phi ] ) .",
    "finally a word of caution must be said here .",
    "the jlich group has also shown  @xcite that the correlated @xmath42 and @xmath43 exchanges lead to a value for the ratio @xmath44 of 0.49 .",
    "this value is much smaller than the results obtained in any of the present @xmath45 models  @xcite , for which this ratio varies from 0.58 to 1 .",
    "therefore , the intermediate range attraction in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 channels will be significantly reduced if one assumes the results of the microscopical calculations of refs .",
    "then , a value for the ratio @xmath48 smaller than 2/3 , predicted by @xmath49 and commonly accepted , would be needed to reproduce the @xmath50 scattering data .",
    "thus , once all nuclear medium effects are understood , it will also be worth studying if a new set of parameters with @xmath51 and @xmath52 provides a simultaneous acceptable description of both double@xmath2 hypernuclei and @xmath53 scattering data .    to",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath1 system can not be studied directly in the free space . @xmath11",
    "@xmath54 scattering provides an indirect source of information about it .",
    "thus , the physics of double@xmath2 hypernuclei provides an independent and valuable method to confirm the findings obtained in the studies of hyperon - nucleon scattering . from these studies",
    ", it is commonly accepted that there exist three kinds of realistic models for the @xmath1 diagonal element of the @xmath8 potential , those developped by the nijmegen , tbingen and jlich groups .",
    "the jlich obe potential for the hyperon - hyperon interaction is a natural extension of the bonn model for the @xmath55-interaction  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have used for the first time jlich type @xmath1 obe potentials to study the dynamics of double@xmath2 hypernuclei .",
    "we have found :    * effective @xmath1 interactions in the medium extracted from jlich type models provide a simultaneous fairly good description of the binding energies of the three known double@xmath2 hypernuclei . * uncertainties in the exact nature of the @xmath11-nuclear core dynamics",
    "lead to uncertainties in the determination of the effective @xmath1 potential in the medium smaller than those due to the experimental errors in the fitted quantities @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the ambiguities in the determination of the @xmath11-core potential do not constitute an important obstacle to learn details about the @xmath1 interaction . * the hf and the perturbative approaches , discussed in subsects .",
    "[ sec : hf ] and [ sec : pert ] respectivelly , lead to quite similar effective @xmath1 potentials . *",
    "the inclusion of @xmath1 correlations in the variational scheme provides a better understanding of the dynamical features of the system .",
    "it also enables less attractive effective @xmath1 potentials than in the hf or perturbative approaches and more similar to those extracted from hyperon - nucleon scattering to describe the binding energies of the double@xmath2 hypernuclei .",
    "* only few waves ( up to @xmath56 ) contribute appreciably to the multipolar expansion of the var wave functions .",
    "* the inclusion of the @xmath57exchange might be relevant to understand the effective @xmath1 interaction derived in this work in terms of the free space one . *",
    "the existing double@xmath2 hypernuclei data can not conclusively favour any particular choice neither of the ratio @xmath58 in the interval @xmath59 $ ] around the @xmath49 prediction 2/3 , nor of the cuttoff @xmath37 in the range = 12 gev .",
    "thus , we end up with a whole family of effective @xmath1 potentials describing the ground state binding energy of the three known double@xmath2 hypernuclei . *",
    "the mesonic decay of @xmath60 and the binding energies and pionic decay widths of heavier double@xmath2 hypernuclei ( not discovered yet ) turned out to be rather independent of the details of the effective @xmath1 interaction within the family of potentials described in the previous point .",
    "this fact has allowed us to predict accurately , for the very first time , the mesonic decay widths of medium and heavy double@xmath2 hypernuclei .",
    "* we have discarded the existence of @xmath0 @xmath1 bound states in the free space if the @xmath8 coupling is negligible .",
    "the natural continuation of this work  @xcite is the study of the nuclear medium modifications of the @xmath1 interaction . such study , together with the effective @xmath1 interactions derived here , will allow us to better understand the dynamical features of the @xmath1 interaction , at low energies , in the vacuum .",
    "thus , it will be possible to contrast features of such interaction from two different and independent sources of data : hyperon - nucleon scattering and @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "statisticaly improved and new experimental data on double@xmath2 hypernuclei , exploring not only light but also medium and heavy nuclei , will be extremely valuable to achive such an objective .",
