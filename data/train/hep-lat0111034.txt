    "supersymmetric yang - mills quantum mechanics ( symqm ) provides the quantitative model of m - theory @xcite . even though much simpler than the original theory the model",
    "is not solved in spite of its long history@xcite .",
    "we have therefore decided to set up a systematic lattice survey of symqm beginning with the simplest case of @xmath1(quenched)@xcite and gradually extending it as far as possible towards the bfss limit _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this talk",
    "i will report on the second step along this programme : the first results for higher n will be presented .",
    "the action of the symqm reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and all fields are independent of the space coordinates @xmath6 .",
    "the supersymmetric fermionic partners belong to the addjoint representation of su(n ) . the discretized system is put on a @xmath7 dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath8 which is reduced in all space directions to @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the gauge part of the action has now the usual form s_g=-_m=1^n_t _",
    "> 1n re ( u_(m ) ) , [ sg ] with = 2n / a^3 g^2 , [ beta ] and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the lattice constant and @xmath14 is the gauge coupling in one dimension .",
    "the integer time coordinate along the lattice is @xmath15 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , guarantee that wilson plaquettes @xmath18 tend , in the classical continuum limit , to the appropriate components @xmath19 without the space derivatives .",
    "up to date we have addressed the two problems : 1 ) extracting the continuum limit from the lattice data , and 2 ) the search for the nontrivial phase structure .",
    "the first point is essential in any approach based on the discretization . in particular restoration of the continuum supersymmetry , of the full unquenched model ,",
    "may crucially depend on the ability to control the continuum limit .",
    "the second issue is connected to the problem of the bekenstein - hawking entropy which has an elegant solution in the framework of m - theory @xcite .",
    "namely the supersymmetric , extremal black holes found in the latter can be viewed as composed of the elementary d0 brane excitations , providing the statistical interpretation of the area of the `` schwarzschild '' horizon which is known to behave as an etropy . in particular , the theory also predicts existence of the two phases in which the gravity and the elementary d0 branes provide good description respectively@xcite .",
    "we have found in @xcite that the continuum limit of the model can be readily extracted with the bare parameters scaling with canonical dimensions .",
    "this is expected for the one dimensional system . to search for the phase transition we have studied the distribution of the eigenvalues of the polyakov line @xmath20 , which is a very sensitive determinant of the phase structure in gauge theories .",
    "it was found that , similarly to the large volume qcd , in the low temperature phase the eigenvalues are concentrated around zero , while at high temperature the distribution is peaked around @xmath21 which constitute the center of su(2 ) . in the space",
    "extended theories the @xmath22 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the infinite volume limit and only one direction is populated . in the present 0-volume system , this may happen only in the infinite - n limit , the gross - witten model being a known example of the critical behaviour emerging at large n.",
    "for higher groups we find now the same behaviour , see fig.1 . since @xmath23 , the histograms correspond to the low and high temperature regions for a range of @xmath24 .",
    "evidently they change from convex to concave at some critical value of @xmath25 similary to the n=2 case .",
    "the nature of the transition is not resolved yet .",
    "nevertheless , our data show unambiguously that the system behaves differently in both regions .",
    "for example , we have also measured the dependence of the size of the system , @xmath26 , on the temperature , and found that it is definitely different , and the change in the behaviour occurs at the same t where the distributions in fig .",
    "1 change their shapes .",
    "it is also possible , for the first time to confront the n dependence of the transition temperature with theoretical expectations .",
    "it follows from eq.([beta ] ) and @xmath27 , that the t hooft scaling @xmath28 implies that the lattice coupling @xmath29 at fixed @xmath30 .",
    "fig.2 shows the @xmath24 dependence of @xmath31 for available range of n together with the fit of the first @xmath32 correction .",
    "indeed , the reduced critical coupling seems to saturate towards higher n and one can estimate that @xmath33 result is within @xmath34 15% of the @xmath35 one ( a horizontal line ) .",
    "we have also studied the new , noncompact formulation of the model which has better numerical behaviour @xcite . in this approach",
    "the @xmath36 spatial degrees of freedom are noncompact @xmath37 and are defined at the discrete time intervals , while the temporal one remains compact @xmath38 .",
    "the action @xmath39 reads @xmath40 the covariant finite difference along the time direction @xmath41 takes into account the parallel transport between adjacent lattice sites .",
    "this system has the same local gauge invariance as the compact version , eq.([sg ] ) . with the new action",
    "we have extended previous study to higher dimensions , d=6 and d=10 .",
    "preliminary simulations confirm results found for d=4 . in particular",
    "the average size of the system @xmath42 shows a characteristic break in the temperature dependence at the position consistent with the t hooft scaling .",
    "moreover , the @xmath42 decreases with d in agreement with the mean field results @xcite .",
    "quantitative lattice study of the yang - mills quantum mechanics , and possibly the m - theory , have just begun .",
    "quenched results are encouraging , but a lot remains to be done .",
    "simulations work for all interesting values of the dimension @xmath7 and are feasible for a range of n. recent results give us a rough idea how the large n limit is approached and where the asymptotics sets it .",
    "all quenched simulations performed up do date indicate existence of the two regions at finite temperature .",
    "this intriguing correspondence with the predictions of the m - theory should be further quantified .",
    "of course , the next step is to include the dynamical fermions .",
    "this can be done by a brute force for d=4 and for the first few n s at d=10",
    ". the one dimensional nature of the system should help considerably . for higher n , at d=10 ,",
    "we face the problem of the complex pfaffian . an important insight into the whole subject may be gained by applying the full potential of the small volume approach @xcite .",
