    "the radiation that arises from placing a quantum field in a background metric with a horizon is a well known phenomenon at the boundary between field theory and general relativity .",
    "the first example of this effect was hawking radiation @xcite , where a schwarzschild black hole radiates with a thermal spectrum at the expense of the black hole s mass .",
    "another example is hawking ",
    "gibbons radiation @xcite , i.e. , the thermal radiation seen by an observer in de sitter spacetime . in this paper",
    "we focus on unruh radiation @xcite  the radiation seen by an observer moving with a constant acceleration through vacuum .",
    "the original methods used to calculate these effects used quantum field theory at a level which is beyond most undergraduates or beginning graduate students . in reference , hawking gave a heuristic picture for the radiation in terms of  tunneling \" of virtual particles across the horizon .",
    "after a span of twenty five years , mathematical details were added to this picture @xcite . in these works , the action for a particle which crosses the horizon of some spacetime ( e.g. , the schwarzschild spacetime for the case of hawking radiation ) was calculated and found to have an imaginary part coming from a contour integration . the exponential of this imaginary piece was compared to a boltzmann distribution , which allowed one to determine the temperature of the radiation .",
    "the simplicity of this gravitational wkb method makes it easy to calculate hawking like radiation for the case of other metrics ( e.g. reissner  nordstrom @xcite , de sitter@xcite , kerr and kerr ",
    "newmann @xcite , unruh @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , one could easily incorporate tunneling particles with different spins @xcite and one could ( in a simplified way ) begin to take into account back reaction effects on the metric @xcite .    in reference",
    ", unruh radiation is derived using purely quantum mechanical arguments .",
    "however , the reader needs to know the quantized radiation field , and the mathematical steps in the derivation are more involved as compared to the approach presented here . in comparison with reference , the gravitational wkb  like",
    "method is mathematically simple while at the same time it provides a clear physical picture for the origins of the radiation . in this article , this wkb  like method is presented in a pedagogical manner for the case of the rindler spacetime ( the metric seen by an observer who undergoes constant proper acceleration ) and unruh radiation .",
    "the reason for choosing rindler spacetime is that it is the simplest spacetime in which this effect occurs .",
    "furthermore , because of the strong equivalence principle ( i.e. , locally , a constant acceleration and a gravitational field are observationally equivalent ) , the unruh radiation from rindler spacetime is the prototype of this type of effect . also , of all these effects",
    " hawking radiation , hawking  gibbons radiation  unruh radiation has the best prospects for being observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this derivation of unruh radiation draws together many different areas of study : ( i ) classical mechanics via the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations ; ( ii ) relativity via the use of the rindler metric ; ( iii ) relativistic field theory through the klein  gordon equation in curved backgrounds ; ( iv ) quantum mechanics via the use of the wkb  like method applied to gravitational backgrounds ; ( v ) thermodynamics via the use of the boltzmann distribution to extract the temperature of the radiation ; ( vi ) mathematical methods in physics via the use of contour integrations to evaluate the imaginary part of the action of the particle that crosses the horizon .",
    "thus this single problem serves to show students how the different areas of physics are interconnected .",
    "also , through this example we will highlight some subtle features of the rindler metric and the wkb method which are usually overlooked .",
    "in particular , we show that the gravitational wkb amplitude has a contribution coming from a change of the time coordinate from crossing the horizon @xcite .",
    "this temporal contribution is never encountered in ordinary quantum mechanics , where time acts as a parameter rather than a coordinate .",
    "in this section we introduce and discuss some relevant features of rindler spacetime  the spacetime seen by an observer moving with constant proper acceleration through minkowski spacetime .",
    "the rindler metric can be obtained by starting with the minkowski metric , i.e. , @xmath0 , where we have set @xmath1 , and transforming to the coordinates of the accelerating observer .",
    "we take the acceleration to be along the @xmath2direction , thus we only need to consider a 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath3 using the lorentz transformations ( lt ) of special relativity , the worldlines of an accelerated observer moving along the @xmath2axis in empty spacetime can be related to minkowski coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath2 according to the following transformations @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the constant , proper acceleration of the rindler observer measured in his instantaneous rest frame .",
    "one can show that the acceleration associated with the trajectory of is constant since @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the trajectory of can be obtained using the definitions of four  velocity and four  acceleration of the accelerated observer in his instantaneous inertial rest frame @xcite .",
    "another derivation of uses a lt to relate the proper acceleration of the non  inertial observer to the acceleration of the inertial observer @xcite .",
    "the text by taylor and wheeler @xcite also provides a discussion of the rindler observer .",
    "the coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , when parametrized and plotted in a spacetime diagram whose axes are the minkowski coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath4 , result in the familiar hyperbolic trajectories ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) that represent the worldlines of the rindler observer .    differentiating each coordinate in and substituting the result into yields the standard rindler metric @xmath12 when @xmath13 , the determinant of the metric given by , @xmath14 , vanishes .",
    "this indicates the presence of a coordinate singularity at @xmath13 , which can not be a real singularity since is the result of a global coordinate transformation from minkowski spacetime .",
    "the horizon of the rindler spacetime is given by @xmath13 .",
    "[ h ]    in the spacetime diagram shown above , the horizon for this metric is represented by the null asymptotes , @xmath15 , that the hyperbola given by approaches as @xmath2 and @xmath4 tend to infinity @xcite .",
    "note that this horizon is a particle horizon , since the rindler observer is not influenced by the whole spacetime , and the horizon s location is observer dependent @xcite .",
    "one can also see that the transformations that lead to the rindler metric in only cover a quarter of the full minkowski spacetime , given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this portion of minkowski is usually labeled _",
    "right wedge_. to recover the _ left wedge _ , one can modify the second equation of with a minus sign in front of the transformation of the @xmath2 coordinate , thus recovering the trajectory of an observer moving with a negative acceleration .",
    "in fact , we will show below that the coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 double cover the region in front of the horizon , @xmath13 . in this sense ,",
    "the metric in is similar to the schwarzschild metric written in isotropic coordinates . for further details ,",
    "see reference .",
    "there is an alternative form of the rindler metric that can be obtained from by the following transformation : @xmath18 using the coordinate transformation given by in , we get the following schwarzschild  like form of the rindler metric @xmath19 if one makes the substitution @xmath20 one can see the similarity to the usual schwarzschild metric .",
    "the horizon is now at @xmath21 and the time coordinate , @xmath22 , does change sign as one crosses @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , from one can see explicitly that as @xmath23 ranges from @xmath24 to @xmath25 the standard rindler coordinate will go from @xmath24 down to @xmath26 and then back out to @xmath24 .    the schwarzschild  like form of the rindler metric given by can also be obtained directly from the @xmath27dimensional minkowski metric via the transformations @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . note that imposing the above conditions on the coordinate @xmath23 fixes the signature of the metric , since for @xmath31 or @xmath32 the metric signature changes to @xmath33 , while for @xmath34 the metric has signature @xmath35 .",
    "thus one sees that the crossing of the horizon is achieved by the crossing of the coordinate singularity , which is precisely the tunneling barrier that causes the radiation in this formalism . as a final comment",
    ", we note that the determinant of the metric for is zero at the horizon @xmath26 , while the determinant of the metric given by is @xmath36 everywhere .",
    "in this section we study a scalar field placed in a background metric .",
    "physically , these fields come from the quantum fields , i.e. , vacuum fluctuations , that permeate the spacetime given by the metric .",
    "in addition , as shown in reference , the vacuum field fluctuations obey the principle of equivalence , which supports this approach . by applying the wkb method to this scalar field",
    ", we find that the phase of the scalar field develops imaginary contributions upon crossing the horizon . the exponential of these imaginary contributions is interpreted as a tunneling amplitude through the horizon . by assuming a boltzmann distribution and associating it with the tunneling amplitude",
    ", we obtain the temperature of the radiation .    writing the scalar field in terms of a phase factor as @xmath37 , the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations for the action @xmath38 of the field @xmath39 in the gravitational background given by the metric @xmath40 are ( see appendix i for details ) @xmath41    now for stationary spacetimes ( technically spacetimes for which one can define a time  like killing vector that yields a conserved energy , @xmath42 ) the action @xmath38 can be split into a time and space part , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 has an imaginary part , this then gives the tunneling rate , @xmath45 , via the standard wkb formula .",
    "the wkb approximation tells us how to find the transmission probability in terms of the incident wave and transmitted wave amplitudes .",
    "the transition probability is in turn given by the exponentially decaying part of the wave function over the non  classical ( _ tunneling _ ) region @xcite @xmath46 the tunneling rate given by is just the lowest order , quasiclassical approximation to the full non  perturbative schwinger @xcite rate . , where @xmath47 is the dalembertian in the background metric @xmath40 , i.e. , the first term in .",
    "as a side comment , the schwinger rate was initially calculated for the case of a uniform electric field . in this case , the schwinger rate corresponded to the probability of creating particle ",
    "antiparticle pairs from the vacuum field at the expense of the electric field s energy .",
    "this electric field must have a critical strength in order for the schwinger effect to occur .",
    "a good discussion of the calculation of the schwinger rate for the usual case of a uniform electric field and the connection of the schwinger effect to unruh and hawking radiation can be found in reference . ]    in most cases ( with an important exception that we will discuss in appendix ii ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the same magnitude but opposite signs .",
    "thus @xmath45 will receive equal contributions from the ingoing and outgoing particles , since the sign difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be compensated for by the minus sign that is picked up in the @xmath49 integration due to the fact that the path is being traversed in the backward @xmath2-direction . in all quantum mechanical tunneling problems that we are aware of this",
    "is the case : the tunneling rate across a barrier is the same for particles going right to left or left to right .",
    "for this reason , the tunneling rate is usually written as @xcite @xmath50 in the @xmath51 sign goes with @xmath52 and the @xmath53 sign with @xmath54 .    there is a technical reason to prefer over .",
    "as was remarked in references , equation is invariant under canonical transformations , whereas the form given by is not .",
    "thus the form given by is not a proper observable .",
    "moreover , in appendix ii , we will show an example of the wkb method for the schwarzschild spacetime in painlev - gulstrand coordinates , and we will find that the two formulas , and , _ are not _ numerically equivalent",
    ".    however , for the case of the gravitational wkb problem , equation only gives the imaginary contribution to the total action coming from the spatial part of the action .",
    "in addition , there is a temporal piece , @xmath55 , that must be added to the total imaginary part of the action to obtain the tunneling rate .",
    "this temporal piece originates from an imaginary change of the time coordinate as the horizon is crossed .",
    "we will explicitly show how to account for this temporal piece in the next section , where we apply the wkb method to the rindler spacetime .",
    "this imaginary part of the total action coming from the time piece is a unique feature of the gravitational wkb problem .",
    "therefore , for the case of the gravitational wkb problem , the tunneling rate is given by @xmath56}~.\\ ] ] in order to obtain the temperature of the radiation , we assume a boltzmann distribution for the emitted particles @xmath57 where @xmath42 is the energy of the emitted particle , @xmath58 is the temperature associated with the radiation , and we have set boltzmann s constant , @xmath59 , equal to 1 .",
    "eq . gives the probability that a system at temperature @xmath58 occupies a quantum state with energy @xmath42 .",
    "one weak point of this derivation is that we had to assume a boltzmann distribution for the radiation while the original derivations @xcite obtain the thermal spectrum without any assumptions .",
    "recently , this shortcoming of the tunneling method has been addressed in reference , where the thermal spectrum was obtained within the tunneling method using density matrix techniques of quantum mechanics .    by equating and ,",
    "we obtain the following formula for the temperature @xmath58 @xmath60",
    "we now apply the above method to the alternative rindler metric previously introduced . for the @xmath61 rindler spacetimes , the hamilton",
    " jacobi equations ( h  j ) reduce to @xmath62 .",
    "for the schwarzschild  like form of rindler given in the h ",
    "j equations are @xmath63    now splitting up the action @xmath38 as @xmath43 in gives @xmath64 from , @xmath44 is found to be @xmath65 in , the @xmath53 sign corresponds to the ingoing particles ( i.e. , particles that move from right to left ) and the @xmath51 sign to the outgoing particles ( i.e. , particles that move left to right ) .",
    "note also that is of the form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the canonical momentum of the field in the rindler background .",
    "the minkowski spacetime expression for the momentum is easily recovered by setting @xmath68 , in which case one sees that @xmath69 .    from , one can see that this integral has a pole along the path of integration at @xmath70 . using a contour integration gives an imaginary contribution to the action .",
    "we will give explicit details of the contour integration since this will be important when we try to apply this method to the standard form of the rindler metric ( see appendix iii for the details of this calculation ) .",
    "we go around the pole at @xmath71 using a semi ",
    "circular contour which we parameterize as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 goes from @xmath75 to @xmath76 for the ingoing path and @xmath76 to @xmath75 for the outgoing path .",
    "these contours are illustrated in the figure below . with this parameterization of the path , and taking the limit @xmath77 , we find that the imaginary part of for ingoing ( @xmath53 ) particles is @xmath78 and for outgoing ( @xmath51 ) particles , we get    @xmath79    [ h ]    in order to recover the unruh temperature , we need to take into account the contribution from the time piece of the total action @xmath43 , as indicated by the formula of the temperature , , found in the previous section .",
    "the transformation of into indicates that the time coordinate has a discrete imaginary jump as one crosses the horizon at @xmath70 , since the two time coordinate transformations are connected across the horizon by the change @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 note that as the horizon is crossed , a factor of @xmath82 comes from the term in front of the hyperbolic function in , i.e. , @xmath83 so that is recovered .",
    "therefore every time the horizon is crossed , the total action @xmath84 picks up a factor of @xmath85 . for the temporal contribution , the direction in which the horizon is crossed does not affect the sign",
    "this is different from the situation for the spatial contribution .",
    "when the horizon is crossed once , the total action @xmath86 gets a contribution of @xmath87 , and for a round trip , as implied by the spatial part @xmath88 , the total contribution is @xmath89 .",
    "so using the equation for the temperature developed in the previous section , we obtain @xmath90 which is the unruh temperature .",
    "the interesting feature of this result is that the gravitational wkb problem has contributions from both spatial and temporal parts of the wave function , whereas the ordinary quantum mechanical wkb problem has only a spatial contribution .",
    "this is natural since time in quantum mechanics is treated as a distinct parameter , separate in character from the spatial coordinates .",
    "however , in relativity time is on equal footing with the spatial coordinates .",
    "we have given a derivation of unruh radiation in terms of the original heuristic explanation as tunneling of virtual particles tunneling through the horizon @xcite .",
    "this tunneling method can easily be applied to different spacetimes and to different types of virtual particles .",
    "we chose the rindler metric and unruh radiation since , because of the local equivalence of acceleration and gravitational fields , it represents the prototype of all similar effects ( e.g. hawking radiation , hawking  gibbons radiation ) .    since this derivation touches on many different areas  classical mechanics ( through the h ",
    "j equations ) , relativity ( via the rindler metric ) , relativistic field theory ( through the klein  gordon equation in curved backgrounds ) , quantum mechanics ( via the wkb method for gravitational fields ) , thermodynamics ( via the boltzmann distribution to extract the temperature ) , and mathematical methods ( via the contour integration to obtain the imaginary part of the action )  this single problem serves as a reminder of the connections between the different areas of physics .",
    "this derivation also highlights several subtle points regarding the rindler metric and the wkb tunneling method . in terms of the rindler metric",
    ", we found that the different forms of the metric and do not cover the same parts of the full spacetime diagram .",
    "also , as one crosses the horizon , there is an imaginary jump of the rindler time coordinate as given by comparing and .",
    "in addition , for the gravitational wkb problem , @xmath91 has contributions from both the spatial and temporal parts of the action .",
    "both these features are not found in the ordinary quantum mechanical wkb problem .    as a final comment ,",
    "note that one can define an absorption probability ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) and an emission probability ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) .",
    "these probabilities can also be used to obtain the temperature of the radiation via the  detailed balance method \" @xcite @xmath94 using the expression of the field @xmath37 , the schwarzschild  like form of the rindler metric given in , and taking into account the spatial _ and _ temporal contributions gives an an absorption probability of @xmath95 and an emission probability of @xmath96 the first term in the exponents of the above probabilities corresponds to the spatial contribution of the action @xmath38 , while the second term is the time piece .",
    "when using this method , we are not dealing with a directed line integral as in , so the spatial parts of the absorption and emission probability have opposite signs .",
    "in addition , the absorption probability is @xmath36 , which physically makes sense  particles should be able to fall into the horizon with unit probability .",
    "if the time part were not included in @xmath97 , then for some given @xmath42 and @xmath6 one would have @xmath98 , i.e. , the probability of absorption would exceed @xmath36 for some energy .",
    "thus for the detailed balance method the temporal piece is crucial to ensure that one has a physically reasonable absorption probability .",

    "gordon equation in the following manner .",

    "gordon ( kg ) equation for a scalar field @xmath39 of mass @xmath99 , placed in a background metric @xmath40 is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the speed of light and @xmath102 is planck s constant . for minkowski spacetime ,",
    "the above reduces to the free klein ",
    "gordon equation , i.e. , @xmath103 .    in using a scalar field",
    ", we are following the original works @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that , absent the hypothetical higgs boson , there are no known fundamental scalar fields , the derivation with spinor or vector particles would only add the complication of having to carry around spinor or lorentz indices without adding to the basic understanding of the phenomenon . using the wkb approach presented here it is straightforward to do the calculation using spinor@xcite or vector particles .      the above equation can be simplified using the fact that the covariant derivative of any metric @xmath106 vanishes @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the christoffel connection .",
    "all the metrics that we consider here are diagonal so @xmath109 , for @xmath110 .",
    "it can also be shown that @xmath111 using and , the term @xmath112 in can be rewritten as @xmath113 since the harmonic condition is imposed on the metric @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 . thus becomes @xmath116 we now express the scalar field @xmath39 in terms of its action @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath119 is an amplitude @xcite not relevant for calculating the tunneling rate . plugging this expression for @xmath39 into",
    ", we get @xmath120 taking the classical limit , i.e. , letting @xmath121 , we obtain the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations for the action @xmath38 of the field @xmath39 in the gravitational background given by the metric @xmath40 , @xmath122      the painlev  gulstrand form of the schwarzschild spacetime is obtained by transforming the schwarzschild time @xmath4 to the painlev  gulstrand time @xmath123 @xmath124 applying the above transformation to the schwarzshild metric gives the painlev  gulstrand form of the schwarzschild spacetime @xmath125 the time is transformed , but all the other coordinates ( @xmath126 ) are the same as the schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "if we use the metric in to calculate the spatial part of the action as in and , we obtain @xmath127 each of these two integrals has an imaginary contribution of equal magnitude , as can be seen by performing a contour integration .",
    "thus one finds that for the ingoing particle ( the @xmath53 sign in the second integral ) one has a zero net imaginary contribution , while from for the outgoing particle ( the @xmath51 sign in the second integral ) there is a non ",
    "zero net imaginary contribution .",
    "therefore in this case there is clearly a difference by a factor of two between using and which comes exactly because the tunneling rates from the spatial contributions in this case do depend upon the direction in which the barrier ( i.e. , the horizon ) is crossed .",
    "the schwarzcshild metric has a similar temporal contribution as for the rindler metric @xcite .",
    "the painlev  gulstrand form of the schwarzschild metric actually has _ two _ temporal contributions : ( i ) one coming from the jump in the schwarzschild time coordinate similar to what occurs with the rindler metric in and ; ( ii ) the second temporal contribution coming from the transformation between the schwarzschild and painlev  gulstrand time coordinates in . if one integrates equation , one can see that there is a pole coming from the second term .",

    "canonical invariance and to recover the temperature  it is which should be used over , when calculating @xmath45 . in ordinary quantum mechanics , there is never a case  as far as we know  where it makes a difference whether one uses or .",
    "this feature  dependence of the tunneling rate on the direction in which the barrier is traverse  appears to be a unique feature of the gravitational wkb problem . so in terms of the wkb method as applied to the gravitational field , we have found that there are situations ( e.g. schwarzschild spacetime in painlev  gulstrand coordinates ) where the tunneling rate depends on the direction in which barrier is traversed so that over are not equivalent and will thus yield different tunneling rates , @xmath91 .      for the standard form of the rindler metric given by , the hamilton ",

    ".    looking at , we see that the pole is now at @xmath26 and a naive application of contour integration appears to give the results @xmath133 .",
    "however , this can not be justified since the two forms of the rindler metric  and  are related by the simple coordinate transformation , and one should not change the value of an integral by a change of variables . the resolution to this puzzle is that one needs to transform not only the integrand but the path of integration , so applying the transformation to the semi ",

    "<S> this temporal contribution to the tunneling rate has no analog in the ordinary quantum mechanical wkb calculation . </S>"
