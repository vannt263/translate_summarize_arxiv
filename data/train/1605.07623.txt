    "the star formation rate of a galaxy is a crucial driver of its evolution @xcite .",
    "its dependence on the gas density and/or galaxy type is often embodied by star formation relations , namely , power - law relations between the surface density of the gas , @xmath0 , and the surface density of the star formation rate , @xmath1 :    @xmath2    based on a combined sample of spiral and starburst galaxies , @xcite derive a super - linear relation ( @xmath3 ; his fig .",
    "6 ) between the disk - averaged surface densities of the star formation rate ( @xmath1 ) and of the total gas mass ( @xmath0 ) , where the latter accounts for the atomic and molecular hydrogen ( obtained via h  i and co measurements , respectively ) .",
    "equation  [ eq : sfla ] with @xmath3 is often referred to as the schmidt - kennicutt law . @xcite",
    "was the first to postulate a power - law scaling for the neutral hydrogen and population  i stars of the galactic disc , for which he found @xmath4 .",
    "he also suggested that eq .",
    "1 could be valid for galaxies .",
    "in addition to surface - density measurements , star formation relations can also be defined based on global measurements , i.e. as the total star formation rate as a function of gas mass . in that respect ,",
    "@xcite investigate how the star formation activity of a sample of spiral , luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies scales with their total and dense molecular gas contents .",
    "they find a super - linear ( slope @xmath5 ) relation between the total star formation rate ( as traced by the galaxy far - infrared luminosity , @xmath6 ) and the total molecular gas mass ( as traced by co luminosity , @xmath7 ) , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "that is , the slope is reminiscent of that of @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the relation between the star formation rate of galaxies and their dense molecular gas mass ( as traced by the hcn line luminosity ) is linear , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "this direct proportionality between the star formation rate and the dense gas mass thus differs from the schmidt - kennicutt relation .",
    "according to @xcite , the linear scaling @xmath9 stems from the high - mass star - forming sites being the dense regions of giant molecular clouds , rather than their envelopes which are the main co - emitters .",
    "this is the combination of spiral and starburst galaxies in one single sample which yields @xmath3 in the schmidt - kennicutt relation and in the @xmath10 relation of @xcite . in starburst ,",
    "luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies , the dense gas mass fraction is higher than in spiral galaxies , thereby promoting a higher star formation activity for a given @xmath11 luminosity .",
    "this interpretation has been strengthened by @xcite who find that the linear correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 established by @xcite for entire galaxies also holds for individual molecular clumps of the galactic disk .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite therefore also argue that the most relevant parameter for the star formation rate is the amount of _ dense _ molecular gas traced by hcn emission , that is , gas with a mean density of @xmath14 .",
    "further support to this picture has been added by @xcite who find that the total star formation rate of nearby molecular clouds is linearly proportional to their dense gas content ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , and that this relation for molecular clouds might extend that already established for galaxies .",
    "in fact , regardless of whether one considers their total gas mass or their dense gas mass , nearby clouds do not show any super - linear star formation relation .",
    "that is , the data for the nearby clouds @xcite and for spiral galaxies @xcite are incompatible with the classical schmidt - kennicutt relation .",
    "@xcite show that the star formation relation is linear , from individual clouds to entire galaxies , as long as their dense gas fraction is the same .",
    "in addition to the global measurements for galaxies and molecular clouds quoted above , star formation relations have also been established for the interiors of molecular clouds of the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) : @xmath15    where @xmath0 and @xmath16 are the surface densities of gas and young stellar objects ( ysos ) measured in a particular region of a molecular cloud , rather than averaged over the entire cloud .",
    "the spatial scale of these star formation relations is therefore the pc - scale , and the measured slope ranges from @xmath17 @xcite to @xmath18 @xcite . by assigning a duration to the star formation episode , @xmath19 , one obtains the surface density of the star formation rate : @xmath20 an equation analogous to eq .",
    "[ eq : sfla ] although , given the local nature of its measurements , eq .  [ eq : sflc ] can not be directly compared to eq .",
    "[ eq : sfla ] .",
    "nearby molecular clouds are exquisite targets when it comes to resolving their stellar content on a yso - by - yso basis , but they are devoid of massive stars . to learn about massive - star formation",
    ", we must look at compact molecular clumps with distances of , typically , several kpc . at such distances ,",
    "their embedded stellar content remains unresolved ( although alma is now changing that ) .",
    "their star formation activity must thus be traced by a global property such as the clump total infrared luminosity , @xmath21 emission , or radio continuum emission @xcite .    @xcite obtain the total ( @xmath22 ) infrared luminosity , @xmath6 , and the mean gas surface density of about 50 molecular clumps of the galactic disk . in a comprehensive study aimed at comparing the star formation relations of nearby molecular clouds , distant molecular clumps and galaxies , @xcite compare the gas and star formation rate surface densities of these clumps to the star formation relation they have derived for molecular clouds of the solar neighborhood . to obtain the star formation rate surface density of the clumps",
    ", they assume the conversion between the total infrared luminosity and star formation rate established for galaxies by @xcite .",
    "they find that the star formation relation for molecular clumps is shallower than that for molecular clouds ( see figure 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "also , at gas surface densities of @xmath23 , an increase of the clump star formation rate by a factor of 3-to-10 is needed to bring it in agreement with the values obtained for nearby molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite quote two possibilities to explain this difference : ( i )  star - forming regions behave differently in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-space depending on whether they form massive stars ( as for distant clumps ) , or not ( as for nearby molecular clouds ) ; ( ii )  the @xmath24 calibration of @xcite requires an upward correction .    in this contribution , we discuss a third reason as to why there is a shift between the star formation relations for distant clumps and nearby clouds .",
    "this effect is the following .",
    "while the gas and star formation rate surface densities of distant clumps are averaged over the entire clump extent , in nearby clouds , they can be measured _ at a given location _ of the cloud . in what follows",
    "we will refer these measurements as global and local , respectively .",
    "a local meaurement in a nearby cloud can be done at a given extinction level ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or at a given yso location ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in that respect , we stress that the term ` local ' does not refer to the distance of the clouds ( although due to the resolving power needed to identify individual ysos , local measurements have so far been performed in nearby molecular clouds only ) .",
    "we will show that measuring the gas and star surface densities globally or locally inevitably leads to different star formation relations , in terms of both normalization and slope , _ even when the underlying physics of star formation is the same_. displaying together the local and global star formation relations yields a broken power - law whose composite nature hinders the physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , the steepening of the composite slope at low gas surface densities does not constitute an evidence of a star - formation threshold , at least not a threshold defined in a heaviside manner in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-space .",
    "that local and global measurements lead to distinct star formation relations have already been highlighted by @xcite who show that there is a difference between the local and global star formation relations of nearby molecular clouds .",
    "that is , there is a schmidt relation within molecular clouds , but not between molecular clouds given that galactic clouds have a similar averaged surface density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : princ ] , we show how global and local star formation relations differ from each other .",
    "we also show how the mass - radius relation of molecular clumps drives the slope of their global star formation relation .",
    "section  [ sec : steep ] compares models and observations of the local relation . in section  [ sec",
    ": break ] , we emphasize that the difference in slope between the local and global relations _ per se _ does not indicate a change in the physics of star formation with gas surface density .",
    "we also discuss the implications in terms of star formation density threshold . in section",
    "[ sec : sfeff ] , we discuss the difficulties inherent to estimating the star formation efficiency per free - fall time from the global and local relations . finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "molecular clumps are individual regions of massive - star and star - cluster formation .",
    "their size is often quantified with the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a given molecular tracer . as an example , @xcite map molecular clumps in the @xmath25 transition , and define their radius , @xmath26 , as half the fwhm of the corresponding radial intensity profile , i.e. , @xmath27 . the gas surface density , @xmath0 ,",

    "* ) , and assume the conversion of @xcite :    @xmath32    note that this relation was introduced for optically - thick starburst galaxies , whose bolometric stellar luminosity is reprocessed in the infrared .",
    "we will further discuss eq .",

    "is also averaged over a disk of radius @xmath26 :    @xmath34    ( see eq .  16 and table  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to @xmath0 and @xmath33 as _ global _ surface densities since they are averaged over the whole fwhm - extent of the clump .    for nearby star - forming regions , however , it is possible to measure the surface densities of gas and ysos in successive intervals of visual extinction nested inside a given molecular cloud .",
    "that is , clouds are divided into contour levels of gas surface density , and the gas mass , yso number and surface area are measured for each interval ( see fig .  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "we refer the corresponding surface densities as _ local _ surface densities .",
    "the difference in how both measurements are carried out is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] for the case of a spherical reservoir of gas .",
    "it should be noted that in case of global measurements ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] ) , to define a star formation relation requires a _ population _ of molecular clumps ( since each clump provides one point in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-space ) . in case of local measurements ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] ) , a molecular cloud or , even , one only of its embedded clusters , is enough to define a star formation relation . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to the star formation relation of @xcite as a local relation , and the star formation relation of an ensemble of dense clumps as its global counterpart .",
    "we note that the star formation relations obtained by @xcite for a sample of nearby molecular clouds is also a local relation since the gas and yso surface densities are measured in the vicinity of each yso based on a nearest - neighbor scheme .    in the next section",
    ", we build on the concept of star formation efficiency per free - fall time to obtain the global star formation relation of molecular clumps as a function of their mass - radius relation .",
    "we will assume that the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is a constant .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable hypothesis on the spatial scale of a forming - cluster ( i.e. a few pc ) since the slope of the local relation predicted by the model of @xcite ( @xmath17 ) matches the observed one @xcite when the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is constant .",
    "if it were to increase with gas density , the local star formation relation would be steeper , a possibility we discuss in section  [ sec : steep ] .",
    "consider a molecular clump with a gas mass @xmath35 enclosed within a radius @xmath36 . here",
    ", we remind that molecular clumps lack a neat outer boundary .",
    "their radius is often defined as half the fwhm of a given gas - tracer , with the clump mass the gas mass enclosed inside the half - peak intensity contour .",
    "the mean surface densities of the gas and star formation rate of the clump are , respectively : @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the time elapsed since the onset of star formation .",
    "we assume that a clump is an isolated system ( i.e. no inflows or outflows ) and that it is in static equilibrium . as a result , the surface densities of the gas and star formation rate decrease with time as a result of gas - feeding to star formation ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion about the evolution of the star formation rate ) .",
    "the global star formation rate of the clump obeys : @xmath40 with @xmath41 the star formation efficiency per free - fall time and @xmath42 the gas mass not yet processed into stars at time @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath43 is the free - fall time at the mean volume density of the clump gas , i.e. : @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the gravitational constant .",
    "as we shall see later , equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) slightly underestimates the actual star formation rate of centrally - concentrated molecular clumps .",
    "the surface density of the clump star formation rate is then simply : @xmath47 to define a star formation relation based on eq .",
    "[ eq : sigsfr ] , one needs to consider an _",

    "let us first consider clumps with a common mean volume density and , therefore , the same free - fall time .",
    "equation [ eq : sigsfr ] shows that , with @xmath41/@xmath43 a constant among the clump population , the slope of the global star formation relation is unity ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "its normalization depends on the clump volume density and on the star formation efficiency per free - fall time .",
    "the denser the clump and/or the higher the star formation efficiency per free - fall time , the higher the star formation rate surface density .",
    "[ we will look into the time evolution later in this section ]    now let us consider a population of clumps with identical radii , rather than identical volume densities .",

    "that is , the slope of the global star formation relation depends on the assumed clump mass - radius relation . at constant radius ,",
    "the volume density of the gas increases along with its surface density , which speeds up star formation as @xmath0 increases .",
    "if the star - forming molecular clumps are characterized by a common mean surface density , then the star formation relation becomes a vertical in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) space .",
    "the same pattern holds for giant molecular clouds , given their common mean surface density , as already highlighted by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "we therefore note that to define a global star formation relation for molecular clumps is an ambiguous task , as the slope depends on the clump mass - radius relation .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : sigsfr ] ) and ( [ eq : sigsfr_r ] ) are shown in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] as the green and red lines , respectively .",

    "this is the median number density of the clumps mapped in hcn  1 - 0 by @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude for the radius of these clumps is 1pc , and we therefore adopt @xmath53 in equation  ( [ eq : sigsfr_r ] ) .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] , a star formation efficiency per free - fall time of @xmath54 is adopted so that equation ( [ eq : sigsfr ] ) ( the green line ) matches equation  17 of @xcite ( black line with asterisks ) .",
    "that equation , which we reproduce here for the sake of clarity , @xmath55 provides a good match to the locus of the hcn 1 - 0 clumps of @xcite ( see also the middle panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : hei10wu05 ] where eq .",
    "17 of @xcite is shown along with the data of @xcite ) .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] , the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is @xmath56 , which increases the intercept of eqs  [ eq : sigsfr ] and [ eq : sigsfr_r ] by a factor of 20 compared to the top panel .",
    "@xmath56 is the star formation efficiency per free - fall time used by @xcite to match their model onto the observed local star formation relation of @xcite .",
    "it is puzzling that there is such a difference in the star formation efficiency per free - fall time needed to match the global surface densities of distant dense clumps on the one hand ( top panel ) , and the local surface densities of nearby clouds on the other ( see fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancy may stem from either observed clump stellar surface densities being underestimated , or observed cloud stellar surface densities being overestimated , or a combination of both .",
    "we will further discuss this issue in section  [ sec : sfeff ] .",
    "the blue open circles and squares indicate how an isolated clump in static equilibrium evolves with time in the ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) parameter space according to the semi - analytical model of @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] , the star formation rate of these model clumps is averaged over time .",
    "that is , it is defined as the total stellar mass built at time @xmath39 , @xmath59 , divided by @xmath39 .",
    "the star formation rate surface density thus obeys : @xmath60    as part of the gas is used for star formation , the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is applied to an ever lower gas mass over an ever longer free - fall time . as a result",
    ", the clump location moves toward smaller surface densities of both the gas and star formation rate .",
    "the adopted clump radius is 1pc , the initial gas masses are @xmath61 ( circles ) and @xmath62 ( squares ) , and the physical time - span is 2myr .",
    "as expected , the amount of evolution is larger for higher @xmath41 and/or higher densities .",
    "that is , the span in surface densities is larger in the bottom panel ( @xmath56 ) than in the top panel ( @xmath54 ) , and is also larger for the squares than for the circles .",
    "the length of the sequence also depends on the adopted time - span .",
    "here it is assumed that cluster - forming clumps retain their gas during at least 2myr .",
    "this time - span remains uncertain , however .",
    "the time - scale needed for an embedded cluster to expel its residual star - forming gas depends on an array of parameters , ranging from the depth of the forming - cluster gravitational potential ( hence the clump mass and radius ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the kinetic energy released into the intra - cluster medium by the newly formed massive stars @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy itself depends on the clump mass , star formation efficiency , the stellar initial mass function and how - well it is sampled in the high - mass regime .",
    "another factor at work is the duration of the pre - main sequence phase as a function of stellar mass .",
    "star - forming regions of the solar neighborhood contains class  ii and class  iii ysos .",
    "given that the life - time of a class  ii object is @xmath63myr @xcite , this means that these regions have been experiencing star formation for at least 2myr ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a longer estimate ) .",
    "dense and massive molecular clumps , however , contain intermediate - mass and massive pre - main - sequence stars which settle on the main sequence within significantly less than 2myr .",
    "stellar winds , and stellar feedback in general , may thus terminate the cluster embedded stage at an earlier time than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our adopted time - span of 2myr may thus be an upper limit in the case of dense and massive clumps , as may be the length of the sequence of blue open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] .    given that the model clump radius is 1pc , one would expect to find the starting point of each blue sequence on the red line , which depicts the global star formation relation for a population of clumps with @xmath641pc ( equation [ eq : sigsfr_r ] ) .",
    "the shift between the red lines and the blue - sequence starting points arises because the latter accounts for the concentrated nature of molecular clumps .",
    "star formation proceeds faster in clumps with volume - density gradients than in clumps with a flat density profile . the initial gas volume density profile adopted for the open blue symbols of fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] is an isothermal sphere ( i.e. @xmath65 with @xmath66 the distance to the clump center ) .",
    "for such a density profile , the global star formation efficiency achieved within one free - fall time is not @xmath41 , as may be naively expected , but @xmath67 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the clump density profile can not be taken into account by the simple eq .",
    "[ eq : sfr ] , from which equation  [ eq : sigsfr_r ] is derived .",
    "shifting upwards the analytical solution given by equation  [ eq : sigsfr_r ] ( red line ) by a factor 1.6 brings it in agreement with the numerical solution illustrated by the blue open symbols .",
    "a point worth being emphasized in this section is that even if star formation operates on a given star formation efficiency per free - fall time , the slope of the star formation relation is _ not necessarily _",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( for galaxies ) has an index @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this is often taken as an evidence that star formation proceeds with a given star formation efficiency per free - fall time since the star formation rate then scales as the gas mass divided by the gas free - fall time ( eq .  [ eq : sfr ] ) .",
    "expressed in terms of the volume densities of gas , @xmath69 , and star formation rate , @xmath70 , this gives : @xmath71    and , if the gas scale - height does not vary strongly from galaxy - to - galaxy :    @xmath72    in agreement with the observed kennicutt - schmidt relation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this line - of - reasoning , however , implies that the star formation relation spans a range of volume densities . as we have seen above , when considering star - forming units with a limited range of mean volume densities ( e.g. clumps mapped in hcn @xmath73 ) , the star formation relation is as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : sigsfr ] with @xmath43 roughly constant and , thus , @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath39 is the time elapsed since the onset of star formation , and @xmath77 is the projected distance from the clump center ( while we denote @xmath66 its three - dimensional counterpart ) .",

    "we reproduce them below for the sake of clarity : @xmath81 and @xmath82 we emphasize that the model is purely volumetric , i.e. the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is applied to the volume density , with the conversion to surface density being performed for the sole purpose of comparing the model to observations .",

    "we therefore divide @xmath83 by the time - span @xmath39 since star formation onset so as to convert the local surface density in ysos , @xmath83 , into the local surface density of the star formation rate , @xmath84 : @xmath85    we note that eq .",

    "[ fig : gloc ] are identical to those of fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] except that the open symbols ( time evolution of high - density clumps ) have been removed for the sake of clarity .",
    "figure [ fig : gloc ] shows clearly that the global and local star formation relations have different slopes .",
    "the local relation has a slope of about two ( @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is steeper than the global star formation relations given by equations  [ eq : sigsfr ] ( @xmath48 ) and [ eq : sigsfr_r ] ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we can now understand the issues set in the introduction .",
    "that is , why the observations of @xcite and @xcite have different slopes , and why , at a given gas surface density , they do not necessarily provide the same star formation rate surface density .",
    "this may simply be the result of the intrinsic differences between the global and local star formation relations , with the former represented by the dense - clump data of @xcite , and the latter by the nearby - cloud data of @xcite . as already stated by @xcite ,",
    "this is not necessarily the result of star formation depending on the presence of massive stars .",
    "we also note that , at this stage , this does not necessarily call for a change in the calibration between the star formation rate and infrared luminosity of molecular clumps ( eq .  [ eq : ken98 ] ) . even for a given physics of star formation  e.g. volume - density driven star formation with a given star formation efficiency per free - fall time  , different slopes and different normalizations are expected when measuring the surface densities locally or globally ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gloc ] ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath54 ( top panel of figure [ fig : gloc ] ) , the global star formation relation at constant mean volume density ( green line ) predicts a star formation rate surface density five times smaller than its local counterpart ( blue line with plain squares ) at @xmath89 .",
    "it is therefore worth emphasizing that fitting locally - obtained data with a global model could result in the erroneous conclusion that the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is an increasing function of the gas surface density .",
    "our result that the local and global star formation relations have different slopes is reminiscent of that of @xcite .",
    "they note that nearby molecular clouds present a power - law local star formation relation ( with a slope of 2 ) , but no global star formation relation given that their mean surface density is about constant , at @xmath90 .",

    "we point out that , in figure [ fig : hei10 ] , both the observations and the model describe a _",
    "local _ star formation relation . therefore",
    ", the mismatch between both slopes can not be ascribed to an inconsistent comparison between a global model and local observations , or vice - versa .    here , we speculate about two possibilities which may explain this slope difference .    _ ( i ) _ the observations of @xcite may suggest that the star formation efficiency per free - fall time increases with the gas density .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : hei10 ] , where three models with distinct star formation efficiencies per free - fall time are shown along with the observations .",
    "an increase with gas density of the star formation efficiency per free - fall time would hasten star formation in the clump inner regions . in turn , this would yield a star formation relation steeper than @xmath17 , although it remains to be seen whether this effect is strong enough to explain the observations of @xcite .",
    "additional consequences would include density profiles of forming clusters steeper than what is predicted by the model of @xcite ( see their figs  1 and 2 ) and , presumably , a greater ability of their inner regions to survive the expulsion of the residual star formation gas .",
    "we stress , however , that a proper calibration of the star formation efficiency per free - fall time requires additional parameters such as the mass and volume density of the star - forming region ( the cloud mass and radius adopted here are @xmath94 and 6pc , as in section  [ ssec : loc ] ) .",
    "in addition , the data of @xcite describe entire molecular clouds , i.e. complexes of cluster - forming clumps .",
    "ideally , one would like to have the data as per molecular clump and to match them with models of the same mass and radius .",
    "therefore , the simple exercise of the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : hei10 ] alone does not allow one to quantify the range of @xmath41 at work in nearby molecular clouds , assuming there is one .",
    "it should also be noted that the star formation relation inferred by @xcite presents a range of slopes , from 1.9 ( ophiuchus molecular cloud ) to 2.7 ( monr2 molecular cloud ) , with eq .",
    "[ eq : gutsfr ] providing only a mean trend for their whole cloud sample .",

    "( ii ) _ @xcite derive , based on a likelihood analysis , a slope of @xmath17 for the orion - a molecular cloud ( note that their @xmath95-parameter is our @xmath96 slope ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the model prediction for a constant star formation efficiency per free - fall time .",
    "they also generate a synthetic population of protostars obeying a given star formation relation , and investigate how well it is recovered , using either a likelihood analysis or a simple least - squares fit of binned data .",
    "interestingly , the slope they recover with the least - squares fit is significantly steeper than the intrinsic one .",
    "for an input / intrinsic slope of @xmath97 , the recovered one is steeper by almost one dex , i.e. @xmath98 .",
    "a maximum - likelihood analysis is needed to recover the input slope accurately .",
    "they ascribe the poor accuracy of the standard fit to its inability to account for the poisson statistics of the bins , and to the loss of information inherent to data binning . given that the data of @xcite correspond to bins in visual extinction , hence gas surface density",
    ", it would be interesting to see whether there is a statistical bias responsible for their fairly steep slope of @xmath93 .",
    "such an investigation is beyond the scope of this contribution , however .",
    "+ an observed local star formation relation steeper than @xmath17 can therefore result from either a statistical bias , or variations of the star formation efficiency per free - fall time with the gas density ( or from any other so far overlooked parameter ) .",
    "this example demonstrates the need and importance of a reliable processing of the data before interpreting them physically .",
    "that the local star formation relation is steeper than its global counterpart ( see fig .  [",

    "this is illustrated in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hei10wu05 ] where the adopted models are as in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gloc ] , that is , a low - density clump ( mean volume density of 12@xmath99 ) for the local relation , and an ensemble of high - density clumps ( mean volume density of 700@xmath99 ) for the global relation . in both cases ,",
    "the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is @xmath56 . at a gas surface density of @xmath100 , the local relation ( blue line with plain squares ) crosses the global one ( green line ) .",
    "an observed local relation is expected to present an upper limit caused by the inability of the observing facility to resolve regions of too high stellar densities .",
    "the highest surface density of the star formation rate in @xcite is @xmath101 .",
    "model surface densities higher than that limit are represented as a ( blue ) symbol - free dashed line in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hei10wu05 ] . as for the observed global relation ,",
    "it presents a lower limit due to the scarcity of hcn 1 - 0 clumps whose surface density is lower than @xmath102 .",
    "we impose the corresponding lower limit to the global relation ( solid green line ) .",
    "the combination of both aspects , namely , the change of slope from the global relation to the local one , and their respective ranges in gas and star surface densities , may at first glance suggest that star formation becomes less efficient at @xmath103 . yet , as we have seen , this conclusion would be erroneous .",
    "the change in slope stems from modifying how the gas and star surface densities are measured , that is , through a succession of shells in the local relation , while it is averaged over the whole clump extent in the global relation ( see fig .  [",

    "this decrease is apparent only : it is driven by the swap of the global star formation relation for a local one towards lower gas surface densities .",
    "this also explains why a double power - law yields a better fit to the combined data set of the middle panel than does a single power - law ( see section 3.2.1 in * ? ? ?",

    "we note that the models and observations occupy different locii in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) parameter space , an aspect we will discuss in section  [ sec : sfeff ] .      @xcite observe in their data a steep decline in @xmath1 and @xmath106 at a gas surface density of @xmath107 .",
    "they identify that steep decline as a star formation threshold in gas surface density .",
    "while their local measurements alone may already suggest a slope change , the effect is strengthened by the combination of the local and global star formation relations all - together . as we saw in section  [ ssec : comp ] , this leads to a composite star formation relation whose physical interpretation can be spurious .",

    "however , two other clouds in the sample of @xcite , orion  b and california , show evidence for such a threshold , the result for orion  b being somewhat less constrained than for california ( see eq .  3 and table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "although there is no clearly - established heaviside threshold in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) space , @xcite find evidence for a threshold in the cumulative protostellar fraction , that is , in the evolution of the number of protostars enclosed within a given extinction level as a function of extinction . in the case of orion",

    "the mean volume density of the low - density clump is varied by almost an order of magnitude , from 4 to 36@xmath99 . with a higher volume density , the local star formation relation reaches higher surface densities , but without changing its slope or normalization markedly . in the middle panel ,",
    "the local relation is presented for various time - spans since star formation onset , i.e. @xmath112 and 3myr .",
    "a difference is noticeable in the high - density regime , which corresponds to the clump central regions where the free - fall time is shorter hence gas depletion quicker : longer time - spans yield smaller gas surface densities , as expected , but do not affect the overall trend .",
    "in the bottom panel , we decrease the star formation efficiency per free - fall time by an order of magnitude , i.e. @xmath113 instead of @xmath114 in the top and middle panels . the models and",
    "the data now occupy similar locii in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) diagram , although the discrepancy in the slope of the local relation remains . as we saw in section",
    "[ sec : steep ] , steepening the model slope could be obtained by increasing the star formation efficiency per free - fall time with the gas density .",
    "another possibility is that the local relation inferred by @xcite is artificially steepened as a consequence of binning the data in visual extinction hence gas surface density @xcite .",

    "( see eq .",
    "[ eq : gutsfr ] in this paper ) , @xcite estimate the star formation efficiency per free - fall time to be between 3 and 10% , depending on the adopted duration of the class  ii phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : pdisc ] shows that @xmath113 is still slightly too large for the high - density model ( solid green line ) to match the location of the hcn 1 - 0 clumps of @xcite ( dashed line with asterisks ) .",
    "we indeed saw in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : glob ] that the high - density clump data suggest @xmath115% .",
    "how can that value be reconciled with the significantly higher estimate of @xcite ?",
    "there might be different explanations .",
    "the total infrared luminosity of the clumps in @xcite is underestimated as a result of being derived from the four @xmath116 bands ( see eq .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite note that most clumps are extended sources , i.e. the average source size is larger than the @xmath116 beam .",
    "they therefore re - estimate the infrared fluxes by performing aperture photometry of the clumps , instead of adopting the data from the @xmath116 point - source catalog .",
    "@xcite note that their @xmath6 estimate is higher than what is obtained from the @xmath116 point - source catalog by a factor of two on average .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : lircomp ] which compares the infrared luminosities of dense molecular clumps as obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "doubling the clump infrared luminosity raises the global star formation relation by a factor of two in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) parameter space and yields therefore twice as high an estimate of the @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath113 rather than @xmath54 .",
    "although most of the stellar light is reprocessed into the infrared for both starburst galaxies and dense molecular clumps , @xcite point out that eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] is not appropriate to recover the star formation rate of individual clumps from their infrared luminosity .",
    "this issue is also discussed by @xcite who quote that the @xmath24 calibration of @xcite is likely to underestimate the star formation rate of an individual molecular clump .",
    "this is because during the first few myr of star formation inside a clump , the ratio between its infrared luminosity and star formation rate is lower than given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] , even when the stellar initial mass function is evenly populated up to its upper mass limit .",
    "figure  1 in @xcite shows that the ratio between the luminosity and star formation rate of a stellar population is lower than the @xcite relation by a factor of 5 at @xmath117myr and by a factor of 10 at @xmath118myr ( see also @xcite and section  3.2 of @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the situation is even worse for forming - clusters not massive enough to sample the full mass range of the stellar imf . in the case of the orion",
    "a and orion  b clouds , @xcite show that the star formation rate obtained from the fir - luminosity underestimates that obtained from direct - yso counting by a factor of 8 .",
    "these two factors  time - evolving infrared luminosity and under - sampling of the stellar imf  therefore yield luminosity - to - star formation rate ratios significantly lower than what is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] .",
    "thus the observed star formation relation of dense clumps ( grey line with asterisks in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdisc ] ) , obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] , may underestimate the actual star formation rate surface density .",
    "accordingly , the clump @xmath41 may be higher than the 1%-estimate inferred in section  [ ssec : lir ] .",
    "that is , if eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] is higher than the actual luminosity - to - star formation rate ratio by a factor of 5 , the clump star formation rate derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] will be underestimated by a factor of 5 , and so will be the estimated star formation efficiency per free - fall time .",
    "therefore , the dense - clump data of @xcite do not exclude @xmath41 estimates of a few percent .",
    "we also note that the majority of the clumps studied by @xcite have masses smaller than 3000@xmath119 ( their fig .",
    "they will therefore produce stellar populations where the high - mass tail of the stellar imf is not , or poorly , sampled ( although a fraction of star formation may occur at densities lower than @xmath120 , i.e. beyond the hcn @xmath121 half - peak contour ; see figs .  1 and 7 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the small cluster mass would strengthen the discrepancy between eq .",
    "[ eq : ken98 ] and the actual luminosity - to - star formation rate ratio of the clumps , leading to even greater upward corrections of their star formation efficiency per free - fall time .",
    "+ and there is yet another source of uncertainty in deriving the star formation rate of a clump from its infrared luminosity .",
    "this additional uncertainty is related to the clump star formation history .",
    "figure  1 in @xcite builds on a constant rate of star formation .",
    "yet , indications of a star formation activity declining with time have been obtained for some star - forming regions , e.g. chamaeleon  i @xcite . for molecular clumps in near - equilibrium , a decrease with time of their star formation rate is expected as a result of gas depletion as stars form , and of the corresponding increase of the clump free - fall time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an in - depth discussion ) .",
    "an additional requirement to convert the clump infrared luminosity into their star formation rate is therefore a model accounting for the actual star formation history , which may not be one of a constant star formation rate .",
    "finally , we note that , even on a galaxy scale , @xcite recommend an upward revision of extragalactic star formation rates .",
    "it may also be that @xcite overestimated the star formation efficiency per free - fall time because the star formation relation of @xcite is itself overestimated .",

    "this is a factor of 50 less than found by @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that the star formation relation of @xcite covers class  i and class  ii objects , while @xcite include only class  i protostars . given that in nearby star - forming regions the total number of class  i and class  ii objects is higher than the number of class  i objects by a factor of 3-to-10 ( see table  1 in * ? ? ?",

    "+ in summary , there are various possibilities to bridge the gap between the @xmath41 as estimated for individual molecular clumps ( @xmath129% , top panel of fig .",
