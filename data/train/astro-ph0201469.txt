    "afterglow emissions from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the x - ray , optical , and radio wavebands are in good agreement with afterglow models of relativistic fireballs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed afterglow spectrum is well - described as synchrotron emission that arises from the interaction of the relativistic blast wave with bulk lorentz factor @xmath7 with the ambient medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the often highly variable gamma - ray phase of the burst may reflect the physical behavior of the fireball progenitor through collisions internal to the flow , i.e. , internal shocks ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , dermer and mitman ( 1999 )",
    "have suggested a blast wave with an inhomogenous external medium .",
    "heinz and begelman ( 1999 ) have suggested an inhomogeneous bullet - like jet outflow that encounters the interstellar medium .    the precise relationship between the observed grb and the afterglow emission is not well understood .",
    "grbs recorded by the _ bepposax _ satellite suggest that the x - ray afterglow emission may be delayed in time from the main grb ( e.g. , grb970228 , @xcite ) or may begin during the grb emission ( e.g. , grb980519 , @xcite ) . in the latter case , it is not clear if the x - ray afterglow is a separate underlying emission component or a continuation of the grb itself .",
    "the internal - external shock model presents a scenario in which emission from internal and external shocks may overlap in time .",
    "if the internal shocks reflect the activity of the progenitor , then the onset of the afterglow may be separated from the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "since the nature of the progenitor is not known , the effect of the ambient medium on the emission from the progenitor is highly problematic .",
    "the model therefore does not prohibit internal and external shock emissions from overlap , while in other cases the afterglow emission may be delayed with respect to the grb ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of optical emission simultaneous with the gamma - ray emission of grb990123 ( @xcite ) provided the first evidence for two distinct emission components in a grb ; here , the prompt optical emission is believed to originate from synchrotron emission in the production of the reverse shock generated when the ejecta encounters the external medium ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum of grb990123 can not be extrapolated from the spectral flux from the simultaneous optical emission , indicating that the optical and gamma - ray emission originate from two separate mechanisms ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for overlapping shock emission was also found in grb980923 ( @xcite ) , where a long power - law decay tail ( @xmath8 ) was observed in soft gamma - rays ( 25 - 300 kev ) .",
    "two separate emission components are favored in this burst because the spectral characteristics of the tail were markedly different from those of the variable main grb emission .",
    "the spectrum in the tail is consistent with that of a slow - cooling synchrotron spectrum , similar to the behavior of low - energy afterglows ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the gamma - rays produced by internal shocks and the soft gamma - rays of the `` afterglow '' may therefore overlap , the latter having a signature of power - law decay in the synchrotron afterglow model .",
    "if this is the case , at least some grbs in the batse database should show signatures of the early external shock emission .",
    "these events would contain a soft gamma - ray ( or hard x - ray ) tail component that decays as a power - law in their time histories , possibly superposed upon the variable gamma - ray emission .",
    "it has been shown that the peak frequency of the initial synchrotron emission , which depends on the parameters of the system ( see @xmath9 ) , can peak in hard x - rays or gamma - rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , it may be possible to see a smoothly decaying grb that is the result of an external shock , i.e. , the grb itself is a `` high - energy '' afterglow . for such grbs , the subsequent afterglow emission in x - rays and optical",
    "would then simply be the evolution of the burst spectrum .",
    "a situation like this might arise when the progenitor generates only a single energy release ( i.e. , no internal shocks ) .",
    "it is well known that the temporal structures of grbs are very diverse and often contain complex , rapid variability .",
    "some bursts exhibit smooth decay features that persist on timescales as long as , or even longer than , the variable emission of the burst .",
    "our investigation focuses on the combined temporal and spectral behavior of a sample of 40 batse grbs that exhibit smooth decays during the later phase of their time histories .",
    "many of these events fall into a category of bursts traditionally referred to as `` freds '' ( fast rise , exponential - like decay ) , bursts with rapid rise times and a smooth extended decay ( @xcite ) . in @xmath9",
    "we present temporal and spectral properties of the afterglow synchrotron spectrum . in @xmath10",
    "we examine the temporal behavior and spectral characterisitics of the decay emission for the events in our sample and compare their spectra with the model synchrotron spectrum . a color - color diagram ( ccd ) technique",
    "is also applied to systematically explore the spectral evolution of each event . in @xmath11",
    "we present a set of high - energy afterglow candidates , followed by a discussion of our results in the framework of current fireball models .",
    "internal shocks are capable of liberating some fraction of the total fireball energy @xmath12 , leaving a significant fraction to be injected into the external medium via the external shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent simulations suggest that internal shock efficiencies can approach @xmath13 ( @xcite ) . nonetheless , as the blast wave sweeps up the external medium , it produces a relativistic forward shock and a mildly relativistic reverse shock in the opposite direction of the initial flow .",
    "the reverse shock decelerates the ejecta while the forward shock continuously accelerates the electrons into a non - thermal distribution of energies described by a power law @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "the distribution has a low - energy cutoff given by @xmath16 . behind the shock ,",
    "the accelerated electrons and magnetic field acquire some fraction , @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the internal energy .",
    "the resulting synchrotron spectrum of the relativistic electrons consists of four power - law regions ( @xcite ) defined by three critical frequencies @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath19 is the self - absorption frequency , @xmath22 is the cooling frequency , and @xmath23 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) . here , we are only concerned with the high - energy spectrum , therefore we do not consider self - absorption .",
    "electrons with @xmath24 cool down to @xmath25 , the lorentz factor of an electron that cools on the hydrodynamic timescale of the shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "the electrons cool rapidly when @xmath26 , known as _ fast - cooling _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , and cool more slowly when @xmath28 , known as _ slow - cooling_. in the fast - cooling regime , the evolution of the shock may range from fully radiative ( @xmath29 ) to fully adiabatic ( @xmath30 ) . in the slow - cooling mode , the evolution can only be adiabatic , since @xmath31 .",
    "the characteristic synchrotron frequency of an electron with minimum lorentz factor @xmath32 is ( @xcite ) @xmath33 corresponding to a break in the observed spectrum with energy @xmath34 where @xmath6 is the bulk lorentz factor and @xmath35 is the constant density of the ambient medium .",
    "although the frequency in equation 1 depends strongly on the parameters of the system , the forward shock may very well peak initially in hard x - rays or in gamma rays ( sari and piran 1999 ) .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum evolves with time according to the hydrodynamic evolution of the shock and the geometry of the fireball ( e.g. , spherical or collimated ) .",
    "specifically , the time dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath21 will strongly depend on the time evolution of the lorentz factor @xmath36 .",
    "assuming a spherical blast wave and a homogeneous medium , for radiative fast - cooling , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while for adiabatic evolution ( fast or slow - cooling ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the shape of the synchrotron spectrum remains constant with time as @xmath20 and @xmath21 evolve to lower values . in the fast - cooling mode",
    ", @xmath21 decays faster than @xmath20 , causing a transition in the spectrum from fast to slow - cooling .",
    "since the break frequencies scale with time as a power - law , the spectral energy flux of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath41 ( erg s@xmath42 @xmath43 kev@xmath42 ) , will also scale as a power - law in time so that @xmath44 , where the spectral and temporal power - law indices , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , depend on the temporal ordering of @xmath20 relative to @xmath21 , i.e. , fast or slow - cooling . for radiative fast - cooling , @xmath47 and for adiabatic fast - cooling , @xmath48 ( @xcite ) . for slow - cooling the spectral energy flux",
    "is @xmath49 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that a simple relation exists between the temporal and spectral indices through the value of the electron index @xmath50 for the high - energy spectral slopes ( @xmath51 ) and the spectral slope below @xmath20 in the slow - cooling regime . defining the low - energy spectral slope as @xmath45 and the high - energy spectral slope as @xmath52 ,",
    "the following relations between the temporal and spectral indices for a spherical blast wave are established ( @xcite ) : @xmath53 the numerical value of @xmath50 is readily determined from the measured high - energy spectral slope , @xmath54 .",
    "long wavelength afterglow measurements give typical electron indices in the range @xmath55 .",
    "although the nature of the emission in this model is always synchrotron radiation with its characteristic slopes and breaks , the time dependence of the breaks are affected by the details of the geometry and dynamics .",
    "the relations in equation 6 are only valid in the case of a spherical blast wave encountering a constant density medium .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) considered the adiabatic evolution of a collimated or jet - like outflow in which the ejecta are confined to a conical volume with a half opening angle @xmath56 .",
    "as the outflow encounters the external medium , the bulk lorentz factor of the flow , @xmath6 , decreases with radius and time as a power - law ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock changes from a power - law to an exponential regime when @xmath57 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observer is able to discern that the flow is confined to an expanding cone rather than a sphere because less radiation is observed . in consequence , a break in the light curve to a @xmath4 behavior is observed as the ejecta sweep up a larger amount of mass .",
    "for adiabatic evolution of a jet , @xmath58 , @xmath59 const , and the peak flux scales as @xmath60 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the spectral flux for an adiabatic jet in the fast - cooling regime is given by @xmath61 and for slow - cooling , @xmath62 the jet geometry can therefore be tested by the simple relation @xmath63 , irrespective of whether the spectrum is fast or slow - cooling , provided that @xmath64 .",
    "we examine the properties of extended decay emission in grbs in the energy range @xmath65 - 2000 kev using data from batse , a multi - detector all - sky monitor instrument onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "batse consisted of eight identical detector modules placed at the corners of the cgro in the form of an octahedron ( @xcite ) .",
    "each module contains a large area detector ( lad ) composed of a sodium iodide crystal scintillator that continuously recorded count rates in 1.024 and 2.048 second time intervals with four and sixteen energy channels , respectively ( known as the discla and cont data types ) .",
    "nominally , a burst trigger is declared when the count rates in two or more lads exceed the background count rate by at least @xmath66 .",
    "various burst data types are then accumulated , including the four channel high time resolution ( 64 ms ) discriminator science data ( discsc ) .",
    "the discsc and discla rates cover four broad energy channels in the 25 - 2000 kev range ( 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , @xmath67 kev ) .",
    "the cont data span roughly the same energy range , but with sixteen energy channels and 2.048 s time resolution .",
    "our dataset was collected by visually selecting events from the current batse catalog with extended decay features , using discsc time histories in the 25 - 2000 kev range .",
    "time histories used in this search had a time resolution of 64 ms or longer , therefore our scan was not sensitive to the selection of events from the short class of bursts in the bimodal duration distribution ( @xcite ) . a study of decay emission in short grbs",
    "will not be included in this analysis but will be the subject of future work .",
    "our search resulted in a sample of 40 bursts , 17 with a fred - like profile and 23 that exhibit a period of variability followed by a smooth decaying emission tail .",
    "we grouped events into three categories based on the characteristic time history of the bursts : ( 1 ) pure freds ( pf ) , ( 2 ) freds with initial variability mainly during the peak ( fv ) , and ( 3 ) bursts with a period of variability followed by an emission tail ( v+t ) .",
    "note that this categorization only serves as a descriptive guideline for this analysis and does not imply a robust temporal classification scheme .",
    "our analysis uses discriminator ( discsc and discla ) and continuous ( cont ) data from the batse lads .",
    "the source count rates in the @xmath68 time bin and the @xmath69 energy channel , @xmath70 , were obtained by subtracting the background model rates , @xmath71 , from the burst time history .",
    "the background model rates in the @xmath69 energy channel were generated by modeling pre and post - burst background intervals appropriate for each burst with a polynomial of order @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",
    "post - burst intervals were chosen at sufficiently late times beyond the tail of the burst , since the time when the tail emission disappears into the background is somewhat uncertain .",
    "this method was adequate for bursts with durations less than @xmath74 seconds . for longer bursts",
    "however , the long term variations in the background can inhibit knowledge of when the tail emission drops below the background level .",
    "for this reason , we applied an orbital background subtraction method to events with durations that exceed @xmath74 seconds .",
    "this technique uses as background the average of the cont data count rates registered when cgro s orbital position is at the point closest in geomagnetic latitude to that at the time of the burst on days before and after the burst trigger .",
    "a complete description of the technique is given in connaughton ( 2000 ) .",
    "in the context of afterglow models , the decay emission is usually fit with a power - law .",
    "we fit the smooth decay of the background subtracted source count rates , @xmath75 , in each burst with a power - law function of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the model count rate of the @xmath68 time bin .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the amplitude , @xmath78 , in counts s@xmath42 , the power - law index , @xmath46 , and the fiducial point of divergence , @xmath79 , given in seconds . as a general guideline , the fit intervals @xmath80 $ ]",
    "were selected in a systematic manner .",
    "for the pf bursts , the start time of each fit interval , @xmath81 , was taken as the time of half - width at half - maximum intensity ( hwhm ) of the burst .",
    "this approach obviously does not apply to the v+t group of bursts . for these events ,",
    "@xmath81 was defined as the bin following the apparent end time of the variable emission .",
    "the fit interval end time , @xmath82 , was defined as the time when the amplitude of the tail count rates first falls within @xmath83 of the background model , where @xmath84 is the poisson count rate uncertainty of the @xmath68 bin of the background model . to avoid obtaining a premature value of @xmath82 caused by statistical fluctuations in the tail",
    ", the amplitude of the count rates in the tail was calculated using a moving average of 16 time bins .",
    "the value of @xmath82 was not particularly sensitive to the width of the moving average .",
    "we further found that the fitted model parameter values were generally insensitive to arbitrarily larger values of @xmath82 .",

    "the power - law fits were strongly favored with @xmath179 values as high as 7.5 .",
    "our results are consistent with that of a similar study for a small number of grbs performed early in the batse mission ( @xcite ) .",
    "nearly all grb spectra are adequately modeled with a low and high - energy power - law function smoothly joined over some energy range within the batse energy bandpass ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the sbpl was chosen to enable direct comparison with the spectral form of the synchrotron shock model .    because we are interested in the spectral behavior during late times of the burst , the cont data - type from individual detectors is the optimum choice of available data - types from the lads .",
    "cont affords the best compromise between temporal and energy coverage , with 16 energy channels and 2.048 s time resolution .",

    "the diversity also suggests that the afterglow may be disconnected from the burst emission ( e.g. , grb960530 ) , or overlap the burst emission ( e.g. , grb920622 ) .",
    "_ bepposax _ has demonstrated the existence of both cases : overlap or continuation of the afterglow onset with the prompt burst emission [ e.g. , grb970508 ( @xcite ) , and more recently grb990510 ( @xcite ) ] , and the case in which the afterglow begins at a later time , disconnected from the prompt grb [ e.g. , grb970228 ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "our analysis further suggests that in some cases ( e.g. , grb971208 ) the early high - energy afterglow may actually be the burst emission itself .",
    "this situation could arise if the energy deposition in the internal shocks is too low .",
    "the spectra of a significant fraction of bursts in our sample , however , show inconsistencies with the synchrotron model . from a catalog of batse grb spectra",
    ", we see that the low and high - energy spectral indices follow well - defined distributions ( @xcite ) . for example , the distribution of low - energy power - law indices given in figure 7 of preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) peaks near @xmath383 .",
    "roughly @xmath74 of the 5500 spectra in the distribution are consistent with the expected value of @xmath306 below @xmath21 , or about @xmath384 . if we adopt the hypothesis that grb spectra are _ not _ synchrotron spectra , then on average @xmath384 of the time we expect to measure parameters consistent with the synchrotron spectrum purely by chance coincidence .",
    "this implies that we can expect @xmath385 events from table 2 to have @xmath330 ( @xmath386 ) purely by chance .",
    "clearly , our total of eight candidate events exceeds this limit .",
    "these events are thus likely sources of synchrotron emission .",

    "our values maintain a significant dispersion under the assumption that the observed high - energy afterglow is equivalent to the high - energy slope of the fast _ or _ slow - cooling synchrotron spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath402 ) .",
    "electron indices in table 2 tend to be steepr on average than @xmath403 .",
    "one possible alternative for a high value of @xmath50 ( @xmath404 ) may be due to a shock generated in a decreasing density , @xmath405 , external medium that is the result of a massive stellar wind ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , sari ( 2000 ) pointed out that there is no reason why the value of @xmath50 should be different for wind models .",
    "note that several values of @xmath50 in table 3 are _ below _",
    "hard electron indices ( @xmath407 ) have recently been reported for the jet model of grb00301c ( @xcite ) assuming a broken power - law electron energy distribution .",
    "similarly , a jet interpretation for grb010222 would also require a flatter electron index , based on analysis of the _ bepposax _ data ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , int zand et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that the slowing of the ejecta into the non - relativistic regime yields @xmath408 .",
    "from a theory viewpoint , malkov ( 1999 ) has shown that it is possible to obtain a hard electron electron distribution in fermi acceleration models .",
    "while the model predictions for the range of electron indices appear somewhat uncertain , the _ observed _ dispersion in @xmath50 values may be strongly linked to the accuracy of the fitted value of @xmath307 .",
    "systematic effects may play a role that introduces a bias toward steeper values in the estimation of the high - energy power - law index .",
    "our analysis shows that the tail temporal decays are well - described by a power - law with a mean index @xmath409 .",
    "while the spectral parameters of approximately @xmath410 of the decays in our sample are in generally good agreement with the synchrotron spectrum , the temporal evolution , in general , does not agree well with the evolution of a spherical blast wave in a homogeneous medium .",
    "there are alternatives that might explain this deviation : first , we only considered fully radiative or fully adiabatic evolution .",
    "more than likely the fireball is neither fully radiative nor fully adiabatic throughout its evolution , although at the very early stages the evolution may nearly be fully radiative while at latter stages the evolution is completely adiabatic .",
    "bttcher and dermer ( 2000 ) have considered the early afterglow regime with the intermediate cases : partially radiative or partially adiabatic blast waves .",
    "they find that the temporal decay of the spectral flux in the fast - cooling regime is a function of @xmath411 , where @xmath412 is the fraction of energy radiated by the accelerated electrons , or @xmath413 for @xmath321 and @xmath414 for @xmath354 .",
    "higher efficiencies therefore produce steeper temporal slopes .",
    "however , as can be seen for @xmath415 , we obtain @xmath416 for @xmath321 . this is steeper than the expected value of @xmath417 from equation 4 but not steep enough to match the discrepancies in our observations .    another possibility to consider is a jet - like geometry or collimated outflow , as opposed to the simple spherical blast wave .",
    "the break in the light curve may occur at early times after the initial shock , as in the case of grb980519 , where evidence exists for a break to a steep decay that apparently occurred during the few hours between the grb and the first afterglow detection ( @xcite ) .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) has shown for adiabatic evolution that the time of the break in the observer s frame goes as @xmath418 .",
    "a very early break therefore requires a very small @xmath56 . if @xmath419 initially , then the slope is steep from the start .",
    "this implies one of two possiblities : ( 1 ) very narrow emission spots , or `` nuggets '' , within a narrow collimation angle , or ( 2 ) a very small value of @xmath6 such that @xmath420 .",
    "the second option is not likely since the observed emission is in the kev to mev range and @xmath421 , requiring a high lorentz factor . a list of events from table 2 and 3 with comparable electron indices and temporal indices ( as required for a jet - like blast - wave )",
    "are presented in table 4 .",
    "note that although the value of @xmath50 for grb990322 is low , the temporal decay does follow the @xmath422 relation .",
    "events with values of @xmath46 shallower than @xmath50 may be events in which the break occurs at some later time after the grb .",
    "we categorize these events as pre - break jet candidates .",
    "three of these events ( grb940419b , grb960530 , and grb970925 ) have some spectral properties characteristic of the synchrotron spectrum ( see last column of table 2 ) .",
    "the five bursts labeled in figure 3 are also candidates for jet outflows . more importantly ,",
    "note that three of these events ( grb920622 , grb980301 , and grb970411 ) are strong candidates because they belong to the group of high - energy afterglow candidates presented in @xmath423 that were selected based on their spectral properties .",
    "the spectra of the remaining two events ( grb920801 and grb931223 ) are only marginally consistent with synchrotron emission from an external shock .",
    "our temporal and spectral analysis of the smooth extended gamma - ray decay emission in grbs has shown evidence of signatures for early high - energy afterglow emission in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the extended decay emission is best described with a power - law function @xmath424 rather than an exponential , similar to the results of ryde and svensson ( 2001 ) who studied the decay phase of a sample of grb pulses with a broad range of durations . from our sample of 40 events",
    ", we find @xmath2 for long , smooth decays .",
    "color - color diagrams have provided a qualitative interpretation of the burst spectral evolution and allow a simple comparison with the evolution expected from the synchrotron model as well as comparison of spectral evolution among grbs .",
    "the ccd patterns and the spectral analysis indicate that @xmath3 of the events in our sample are consistent with synchrotron emission expected from an external shock .",
    "interestingly , three of these events have decay rates consistent with that expected from the evolution of a jet , @xmath4 . because the break is essentially at the onset of deceleration",
    ", the jet must , at least , be very narrow , since @xmath425 .",
    "table 4 suggests that in some cases the break occurs at a later time , so that the prompt emission we observe is pre - break , @xmath426 and consistent with spherical geometry .",
    "a possible scenario is one in which the ejecta is very grainy , where the nuggets in the ejecta are smaller than @xmath427 , similar to the model discussed by heinz and begelman ( 1999 ) .",
    "huang et al .  ( 1999 ) ( see also wei and lu 2000 ) have shown that the break in the light curve is more of a smooth transition due to the off - axis emission of a jet with no angular dependence .",
    "the steep light curve can only occur if the angular size of the nugget is less than @xmath427 .",
    "connaughton ( 2001 ) has investigated the average late - time temporal properties of grbs observed with batse and found statistically significant late time power - law decay emission that softens relative to the initial burst emission , suggesting the existence of early high - energy afterglow .",
    "other studies using phebus ( @xcite ) and apex ( @xcite ) bursts show similar behaviors in late - time grb light curves .",
    "collectively , these studies strongly suggest that the afterglow emission may overlap or be connected to the prompt , variable burst emission . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that not all grbs exhibit such behavior . in some cases",
    ", the initial gamma - ray flux from the external shock may simply be too low to detect ( e.g. , see figure 4 in giblin et al.2000 ) .",
    "in other cases , the bulk lorentz factor may be too low to generate the gamma - ray photons upon impact with the surrounding medium .    as the number of afterglow / counterpart detections increases , the relationship of the afterglow emission to the gamma - rays released in the initial phase of the burst can be studied systematically .",
    "the capabilities of _ swift _",
    "( @xcite ) will allow broad spectral coverage using three co - aligned instruments ( bat , xrt , and uvot ) during the gamma - ray phase and early afterglow phase of the burst and facilitate the distinction between the grb and the onset of the afterglow based on temporal _ and _ spectral information . with well - constrained spectral and temporal parameters in hand , plots of temporal index vs.  spectral index",
    "can be readily constructed and thus provide information on the geometry of the fireball and definitively test the internal / external shock model for grbs .",
