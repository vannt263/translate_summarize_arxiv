    "thus our generalisation of the beg hamiltonian is a good way to study the influence of disorder and frustration on first order transitions .",

    "we now discuss the numerical results in the light of recent work on disordered beg - type models which are not frustrated . after we will address the problem of the stability of the replica symmetric solution .",
    "lets look at the influence of disorder on the first order transition , which can  following blume , emery and griffiths  be interpreted as a phase separation .",
    "this first order transition represents an example of a transition which breaks a global symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under inversion of all spins ; in the ordered phase this symmetry is spontaneously broken , whereas in the paramagnetic phase the symmetry is preserved .",
    "we first consider the non - disordered beg model in the @xmath72 representation , where the appearance of the phase separation is most visible . in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "the phase diagram is shown for a weak quadrupolar interaction . in figure [ fig:9 ] the same is seen for a rather strong quadrupolar coupling @xmath73 .",
    "the point is that the quadrupolar coupling enhances the phase separation . in the limit of @xmath74",
    ", the model tends to behave as the griffiths model @xcite .",
    "we thus wish to emphasise the importance of the presence of a quadrupolar interaction . in the original model of blume , emery , and griffiths ,",
    "even the @xmath25 case exhibits a phase separation .",
    "it is due to the bulk interaction of the @xmath75 species ( he@xmath22 ) and the @xmath76 species ( he@xmath23 ) , the latter allowing an additional degree of freedom ( ferromagnetic phase ) . at low temperature",
    "the ferromagnetic phase is the favoured phase for the @xmath76 species and phase separation occurs in order to permit ordering in a he@xmath23 rich phase . letting @xmath77 allows for an inter - isotopic interaction ; in fact @xmath78 represents a combination of inter - isotopic interactions , @xmath79 , which are assumed to be positive .",
    "it is remarkable that for a range of values of @xmath78 the phase diagram exhibits a triple point together with the critical and tricritical point .",
    "this appears in the original beg model and in the present model , as can be seen from figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "the tricritical point is given in the diagrams by _ a _ , the triple point by _ b _ , and the critical point by _ c _ ; these special points are also marked in figure [ fig:9 ] .    introducing disorder in the beg model may affect the phase separation . figure [ fig:5 ] shows the phase diagram obtained by a numerical extremisation of the free energy . _",
    "the phase separation persists independently of the presence of disorder_. the average over the gaussian disorder has introduced an effective quadrupolar coupling @xmath80 , which  as we have seen before in the non - disordered case  enhances the phase separation .",
    "furthermore this effective interaction is also temperature dependent :    @xmath81    this promotes the phase separation at low temperatures as can be seen by comparing with figure [ fig:9 ] ( for the low temperature regime ) and figure [ fig:1 ] ( for the high temperature regime ) in the non - disordered case . even if there is an effect due to the presence of disorder , which might suppress or change the first order transition , this effect is apparently compensated by the additional term contributing to the effective quadrupolar coupling .",
    "this result complements those of berker _",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they conjecture , in dimension @xmath82 , that the disorder lowers the tricritical temperature ; then that part of the transition line enclosed between the former and the actual tricritical temperature should become second order . also , they claim that all of the first order line is replaced by a second order one if the disorder is sufficiently strong .",
    "a few comments are in order :    1 .   the analysis of berker _",
    "_ relies on the real space renormalisation group approach for an initially positive distribution of the couplings .",
    "this distribution remains positive and consequently can not take into account the effect of frustration .",
    "nevertheless , we do not think that the frustration is responsible for the persistence of the phase separation for the following reason : even when @xmath83 is small , so that there is disorder but essentially no frustration , the phase separation persists ( see the phase diagrams ) .",
    "monte carlo studies by diep _",
    "_ @xcite indicate this persistence and hence ensure that the phase separation is not an artefact of the mean field approach .",
    "the mean field approximation is equivalent to a model in infinite dimensions , perhaps rendering the comparison of our results with the predictions of berker _",
    "nevertheless , it should give an indication of whether the first order transition persists or not .",
    "furthermore one could argue that in infinite dimensions , an infinitely strong disorder is required to suppress the first order transition .",
    "however figure [ fig:4 ] indicates that this model reduces to that discussed by ghatak and sherrington @xcite with a vanishing ferromagnetic coupling , showing again the persistence of the first order transition .",
    "the assumption of replica symmetry is not justified .",
    "however , based on the stability analysis , we have found that the first order transition persists ; it seems rather improbable that it be suppressed by doing the full replica symmetry breaking scheme .    to summarise , berker _",
    "_ claim that their results are generic , but our mean field treatment shows that the phase separation is not affected by the introduction of disorder . in particular , the tricritical temperature is not modified : @xmath84 , if @xmath85 , using the same scaling as berker _",
    "et al_. note that their analysis does not reveal the effective quadrupolar interaction , which plays a subtle role . on the one hand ,",
    "following berker _",
    "_ and their general arguments @xcite , the disorder should change the first order transition to a second order one ; on the other hand , the effective quadrupolar interaction enhances the phase separation , so stabilises the first order transition .",
    "as we have seen above , the effective quadrupolar interaction more than compensates the first effect so that the first order transition persists .",
    "furthermore , since for a small amount of disorder the frustration effects are negligible , the models considered are comparable and our results provide a counterexample to their claim .",
    "the assumption of replica symmetry allows for a simple answer for the beg - sk model",
    ". however , as for the sk model , it leads to an unstable solution and the breaking of the permutation symmetry of the replicas is required .",
    "we expect the parisi breaking scheme to apply here and to remove the instabilities in our model . since under replica symmetry breaking the findings of the analysis assuming replica symmetry are in general confirmed , _",
    "i.e. _ , a spin glass phase persists , we wo nt study finite nor infinite step step replica symmetry breaking . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the replica symmetric solution and we derive the lines of instability to locate the phase transitions lines given in section iv  even though the location of these lines may differ in a more advanced treatment .",
    "the stability of the replica symmetric solution of the sk model in its integer spin generalisation was examined by lage and de almeida @xcite and in greater detail by mottishaw and sherrington @xcite .",
    "these works limit their analysis to the disordered integer s spin glass model without a non - zero ferromagnetic mean and without quadrupolar coupling .",
    "the present stability analysis follows closely the moethods of de almeida and thouless @xcite and subsequent works . to examine the stability of the solution it has to be made sure that the solution extremises the free energy",
    ". the quadratic form @xmath86 describing the deviation of the solution from its stationary value should be positive definite .",
    "@xmath87    the matrix @xmath88 associated with this form is the hessian @xmath89 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hessian should be non - negative to make sure that the solution is stable .",
    "due to the same symmetry arguments used by de almeida and thouless @xcite , we discover three families of eigenvalues which by convention are called : _ longitudinal _ , _ longitudinal anomalous _ and _ replicon_. but in the present case the stability analysis requires the diagonalisation of a hessian @xmath89 which is built out of three blocks . as a consequence there are now three distinct eigenvalues in each family .",
    "the longitudinal eigenvectors are the fully symmetric ones with respect to permutations of the replica indices and are of the form :    @xmath90    they give rise to eigenvalues which are the solution to the cubic characteristic equation .",
    "the full formula for the eigenvalues is too cumbersome to be displayed here , they will be discussed in the paramagnetic phase below ( the full expressions are given in appendix [ eigenapp ] ) .",
    "the longitudinal anomalous eigenvectors are generated by one distinct replica index @xmath91 and look like :    @xmath92    again the eigenvalues are given in appendix [ eigenapp ] .",
    "the replicon eigenvectors are generated by two distinct replica indices @xmath93 and @xmath91 and they are of the following form :    the eigenvalue is given by the solution of the characteristic equation , but as this equation is explicit , so the eigenvalue is obtained immediately :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are appropriate correlation functions given in the appendix . adding the number of eigenvalues obtained in the three symmetry families gives the expected number @xmath97 , i.e. , the dimension of @xmath89 . the so called longitudinal eigenvalues @xmath98 and @xmath99 coincide in the @xmath100-limit as in the work of de almeida and thouless @xcite and lage and de almeida @xcite .",
    "the replica symmetric fluctuations of the one - indexed quantities ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) and the two - indexed quantity @xmath39 are described respectively by the longitudinal eigenvalues , @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",
    "the third eigenvalue @xmath103 is distinct from the other two eigenvalues and is related to the fluctuations which break the replica symmetry of the two indexed quantity @xmath39 . in order to investigate the stability of the replica symmetric solution , for example in the ferromagnetic phase , the eigenvalues @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath103 have to be calculated in this phase . in the appendix the general expressions for the different eigenvalues and the correlation functions appearing therein are given .",
