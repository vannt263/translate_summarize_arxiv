    "since its discovery by dyck , simon & zuckerman ( 1982 ) , the companion to the prototypical low - mass young stellar object ttau has been the subject of numerous studies and a source of many debates . in short , while ttaus  has never been detected at optical wavelengths ( gorham et al .",
    "1992 ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998a ) , it is much brighter in the mid - infrared than the optically bright ttau ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 ) , which we will refer to as ttaun  in the following .",
    "this peculiar characteristic is typical of a handful of other objects , collectively known as infrared companions ( irc , koresko et al .",
    "noticeably , the bolometric luminosity of ttaus  ( 12@xmath4 , koresko et al .",
    "1997 ) is larger than that of the 2@xmath5 ttaun .",
    "furthermore , while ttaunhas remained remarkably stable in recent years after significant historical variations ( beck & simon 2001 ; beck et al .",
    "2004 ) , large photometric variations have been observed in ttaus  ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 ; beck et al . 2004 ) .",
    "ttaus  has also long been known as the source of variable , polarized gyrosynchrotron radio emission ( skinner & brown 1994 ) .",
    "studying the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ttaus , koresko et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a bolometric temperature of @xmath6k , much lower than that of a normal ttauri star ( tts ) and typical of more deeply embedded classi protostars .",
    "however , the close vicinity and assumed coevality with ttaun  appears to rule out the possibility of ttaus  being in a much less evolved stage .",
    "koresko et al .",
    "therefore proposed that ttaus  is a normal tts , possibly slightly more massive than ttaun , that is embedded within a compact opaque envelope responsible for a ( variable ) @xmath7mag .",
    "if its envelope is not larger than a few 100au , then one can argue that this is a different , later , evolutionary stage than classi protostars , whose envelopes typically extend over several thousand au ( motte , andr & neri 1998 ; motte & andr 2001 ) .",
    "ghez et al . ( 1991 ) , van den ancker ( 1999 ) and beck et al . (",
    "2004 ) have used the depth of the 10@xmath1 m silicate and 3@xmath1 m ice absorption features in the spectrum of ttaus  to estimate an extinction ranging from @xmath8 to 30mag with significant variations over time . for comparison ,",
    "the extinction to ttaun  is estimated to be @xmath91.5mag ( kenyon & hartman 1995 ; koresko et al .",
    "such large extinctions to ttausa  explain its non - detection in the optical .",
    "beck et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the photometric variability of ttaus  can be explained by large extinction changes in our line of sight .",
    "hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have proposed that the obscuring material in front of ttaus  is the almost pole - on circumstellar disk of ttaun . however , akeson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded that the outer radius of ttaun s disk is only @xmath10au , about half the ttaun ",
    "ttaus  projected separation .",
    "another interpretation of the large variability of ttaus  is that it is in fact a fuori - like object in which the luminosity is entirely dominated by emission from the accretion disk ( ghez et al .",
    "variability then arises from changes in the accretion rate on the star and the strong brightening observed in the early 1990s can be interpreted as an accretion outburst .",
    "ghez et al.s claim was in part based on the fact that the large flare they observed was essentially grey over the 210@xmath1 m range .",
    "more recently , beck et al . (",
    "2004 ) found that the flux of the br@xmath11 emission line , which is thought to be powered by accretion , correlates with the continuum flux in a way that qualitatively agrees with this scenario .",
    "however , beck et al . also found significant color variability for ttaus , seemingly contradicting the fuori scenario .    to further complicate the picture , koresko ( 2000 ) used speckle interferometry to identify a close ( @xmath12005 or 7au at a 140pc distance , bertout et al .",
    "1999 ) companion to the irc .",
    "such a tight separation immediately made ttaus  one of the most promising system to determine a tts dynamical mass .",
    "its orbital motion has been repeatedly monitored with near - infrared ( khler et al .",
    "2000 ; duchne , ghez & mccabe 2002 ; furlan et al . 2003",
    "; beck et al . 2004 ) and radio ( loinard et al .",
    "2003 ; johnston et al . 2003 , 2004 ) high - angular resolution techniques .",
    "opposite claims have been made regarding the possibility that the ttausa  ttausb  system is physically bound ( loinard et al .",
    "2003 ; furlan et al .",
    "2003 ; johnston et al . 2003 , 2004 ; beck et al .",
    "although the centimeter radio observations provide a @xmath1220  year time baseline , only ttausb  is detected at these wavelengths , requiring critical but uncertain assumptions to be made .",
    "the near - infrared datasets , on the other hand , have spatially resolved ttaus  for only the last few years . yet , preliminary orbital solutions based exclusively on the near - infrared images , which clearly pinpoint all components of the system , suggests an orbital period on order a few decades , a periastron separation of @xmath1310au at most and a system mass of several solar masses ( beck et al .",
    "such a large mass suggests that ttausa  is the most massive component of the ttau system although it remains unclear whether its high dynamical mass can be readily reconciled with its moderate luminosity ( johnston et al .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the most massive object has remained more deeply embedded than its lower mass close companions is also against the natural expectation of a faster clearing timescale for circumstellar material with increasing stellar mass .    from a spatially resolved moderate resolution near - infrared spectrum",
    ", ttausb  has been found to be a normal low - mass tts of spectral type @xmath12m1 suffering from a significant extinction ( @xmath14mag , duchne et al .",
    "this spectrum also shows ttausa  to have a featureless continuum with a strong br@xmath11 emission line synonymous of accretion .",
    "the binarity of ttaus , combined with its strongly variable flux ratio ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ; beck et al .",
    "2004 ) raises serious concern about the conclusions that can be derived from the unresolved near - infrared properties of the system .",
    "clearly , one needs to spatially resolve the tight binary system to study the variability of both components in order to reach firm conclusions regarding their nature , since the brighter component at @xmath15 has changed over time .",
    "some of the peculiar properties of ttausa , namely its featureless @xmath15 band spectrum and extremely red colors , do not apply to ttausb , which appears to be a normal tts ( duchne et al .",
    "therefore , the irc phenomenon in the ttau system is limited to ttausa , and has to be contained within a volume of a few au , even though some extinction is present in front of both components .",
    "a compact and opaque envelope could lie around that source and reprocess stellar starlight at mid - infrared wavelengths , and thereby erase any photospheric feature in its spectrum , as suggested by koresko et al .",
    "however , the dynamical timescale for this compact envelope ( free - fall time scale of a few years ) to be accreted and/or dispersed is several orders of magnitude shorter than the estimated age of the system ( @xmath16myr , white & ghez 2001 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario to explain the apparent faintness of ttausa  consists of invoking a small edge - on disk circumstellar disk .",
    "this scenario , evoked by hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , koresko ( 2000 ) and beck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) appeared to gain ground when walter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) detected an extended absorption feature that is entirely opaque to ultraviolet photons at the location of ttaus .",
    "however , the size of this feature , @xmath1270au , is much larger than the few au maximal size of a circum_stellar _ disk around ttausa . until now",
    "the location of the extincting material in front of ttausa  remains subject to debate .",
    "besides large quantities of dusty obscuring material , the environment of ttaus  also contains numerous evidence for mass - loss .",
    "a large and complex co outflow is known to arise from the whole ttau system ( edwards & snell 1982 ; schuster , harris & russell 1997 ) .",
    "on smaller scales , a multi - component dynamical structure has been discovered and studied through optical emission lines by bhm & solf ( 1994 ) and solf & bhm ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors have proposed that the ttau system is the source of two distinct stellar jets : ttaun  would drive an east - west jet that almost points to the observer whereas ttaus  would be the source for a north - south jet that extends in the plane of the sky .",
    "it is not known whether this second jet comes from ttausa  or ttausb , though .",
    "imaging of the near - infrared shock - excited h@xmath17 emission line has revealed extended emission over several arcseconds ( herbst et al .",
    "on subarcsecond scales , herbst et al . and beck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) detected emission arising from ttaus but higher spatial resolution studies by duchne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and kasper et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found no significant emission at the stars location .",
    "this led beck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to suggest that the line emission arises only from shocked gas in the immediate surroundings of the two stars , in area small enough to be unresolved in direct imaging studies with resolution @xmath121 , but large enough to be resolved out in higher angular studies . using narrow - band high angular resolution images ,",
    "quirrenbach & zinnecker ( 1997 ) argued that some of the complex spatially resolved h@xmath17 emission may arise from a different structure than a stellar outflow .",
    "stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998a ) attempted to model the scattered light images of the reflection nebula centered on ttau , which likely traces an outflow cavity , and found an `` intermediate '' inclination angle , in disagreement with the inclination of either jet identified by solf & bhm ( 1999 ) .",
    "overall , while mass loss clearly occurs in the environment of ttau with at least two distinct outflows , our understanding of the actual source and physical properties of both jets is still poor .    in this paper , we present the first high spectral resolution ( @xmath0 ) , high spatial resolution ( 005 ) study of the ttaustight binary system . with this dataset , we have 1 ) detected accretion - induced br@xmath11 emission from both ttausa  and ttausb , 2 ) shown that the h@xmath17 emission is exclusively associated to the surrounding gas and has a highly complex kinematic and spatial structure , 3 ) detected @xmath18co absorption features from warm gas in the line of sight of ttausa , and 4 ) measured radial velocities for both components of the system .",
    "we also obtained new high angular resolution 1.6 and 2.2@xmath1 m images of the system , as well as the first 3.8 and 4.7@xmath1 m images that spatially resolve all three components of ttau . combining the @xmath18co absorption lines with a new multicolor photometric analysis of ttausb",
    ", we show that ttausa  is an intermediate - mass star surrounded by a small , semi transparent , edge - on disk and that a wider , possibly circumbinary , structure is located in front of both components of ttaus .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in sect .  2 , we present the imaging and spectroscopic datasets used in this study and their reduction procedures . in sect .  3 and 4 , we present we present our photometric and spectroscopic results , respectively .",
    "we discuss them in sect . 5 and summarize our findings in sect .",
    "all observations used in this study have been obtained using the adaptive optics ( ao ) system on the 10 m keck  ii telescope ( wizinowich et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have obtained direct images from 1.6@xmath1 m to 4.7@xmath1 m that clearly resolved the three components of the system ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) , as well as spatially resolved high spectral resolution spectra at 2@xmath1 m of ttausa  and ttausb  ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) . here",
    "we present the instrumental setups used for these observations as well as the data reduction processes . in all observations , the optically bright ttaun  ( @xmath19 )",
    "was used as a natural guide star for the ao system .      on 2002",
    "december 13 , we used the facility ao - dedicated near - infrared camera nirc2 ( matthews et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) , a 1024@xmath31024 detector for which we used the 000995@xmath20000005 pixel scale ( ghez et al .",
    "2004 ) and whose absolute orientation on the sky is 07@xmath2002 ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) . to avoid saturation of the stars in the 2@xmath1 m band , we used two narrow band ( @xmath21 bandpass ) filters centered at 2.18@xmath1 m ( br@xmath11 ) and 2.28@xmath1 m ( @xmath22 ) , respectively .",
    "we further obtained for the first time broadband ao images of the system at 3.8@xmath1 m ( @xmath23 ) and 4.7@xmath1 m ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "for all observations , we used the `` inscribed circle '' pupil mask that decreases the amount of background emission at the cost of a slight loss of resolution ( the equivalent telescope diameter is 9 m ) . in each filter , we used a similar sequence in which the system was placed in 2 or 4 different locations on the chip and 100 short integrations ( 0.020.05s ) where coadded at each location .",
    "shorter integrations , obtained by reading only a fraction of the array ( 256@xmath3264 at @xmath23 and 128@xmath3152 at @xmath24 ) , were used at longer wavelengths to prevent saturation in the background .",
    "on 2003 december 12 , we obtained additional images of the system using the near - infrared imager and spectrograph nirspec ( mclean et al .",
    "its 256@xmath3256 imaging detector provides a pixel scale of 00168@xmath2000001 and its absolute orientation on the sky is 11@xmath2008 , as estimated by us from images of several well - studied calibration binaries .",
    "we used the @xmath15 band ( 2.2@xmath1 m ) filter as well as an instrument - specific 1.6@xmath1 m filter that is very similar to the standard @xmath25 band filter .",
    "the same observing technique was used as during the nirc2 observations described above .",
    "all datasets were sky subtracted , flat - fielded , corrected for bad pixel and shift - and - added using standard iraf routines .",
    "the final images are presented in figure[fig : images ] .",
    "the spatial resolution , as measured from the fwhm of ttaun  in all images , is 0055 , 0072 , 0087 and 0107 at 2.2 , 1.6 , 3.8 and 4.7@xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "all three components are clearly detected in all images , except for the @xmath25 band image in which ttausa  is not detected .",
    "the two components of the @xmath1201 ttaus binary are only barely resolved at @xmath26 .",
    "nonetheless , it is still possible to accurately extract the astrometric and photometric properties of the binary .    for all images , we performed point spread function ( psf ) fitting using ttaun as a perfect nearby and simultaneous psf",
    ". uncertainties on the stars locations and fluxes were determined from the standard deviation of the quantities obtained in each individual image .",
    "all simultaneous images yielded fully consistent astrometric measurements for both the ttaun  ttausa and ttausa  ttausb pairs .",
    "the astrometric uncertainties for the former , wider , pair are dominated by the detectors calibration uncertainties whereas centroiding uncertainties lead to the dominant source of error regarding the former , tighter , binary .",
    "the astrometric results are summarized in table[tab : astrom ] and the photometric results are given in table[tab : phot ] .",
    "the average astrometric measurements from all filters are indicated for each run .",
    "on 2003 december 12 , we used nirspec to obtain 2@xmath1 m cross - dispersed high resolution spectra of the ttaus  binary system .",
    "as illustrated in figure[fig : img_slit ] , we aligned the 0027@xmath3226 slit along the binary system so as to spatially disentangle the spectra of the two components . in order to obtain an absolute calibration of the radial velocities , we also observed hd35410 , an iau radial velocity standard ( spectral type g9iii , @xmath27 km  s@xmath28 , fehrenbach & duflot 1980 ) .",
    "observations of the early a - type stars hr1389 and hd36150 were made with the same set - up immediately before or after ttausand radial velocity standard in order to measure the telluric transmission function .",
    "each star was located at 2 to 6 different locations behind the slit to correct for bad pixels and increase the signal - to - noise ratio without saturating the stars .",
    "we obtained total integration times of 30min for ttaus  and ranging from 40 to 120s for hr1389 , hd35410 and hd36150 .",
    "we selected a single cross - disperser set - up that allowed us to place simultaneously 7 consecutive , though non - adjacent , @xmath15 band orders on the 1024@xmath31024 spectroscopic detector for all objects .",
    "of these , the first two correspond to the short - wavelength end of the @xmath15 band , where strong telluric absorption features are located .",
    "the non - simultaneousness of the observations of the targets and their calibration a - type star resulted in poor telluric corrections in these two orders and they are not discussed further .",
    "the wavelength range of the remaining five orders are indicated in table[tab : setup ] .",
    "our spectral coverage includes molecular ( 2.1218 and 2.2477@xmath1 m ) and atomic ( 2.1661@xmath1 m ) hydrogen lines , as well as three of the four @xmath29 rovibrational @xmath18co bandheads ( 2.293 , 2.322 and 2.383@xmath1 m ) , as well as a slew of associated individual @xmath18co transitions .",
    "in addition to obtaining standard calibration datasets ( halogen flat field lamp and adjacent sky spectrum ) , we obtained spectra of arc lamps that were used to determine the wavelength solution for our dataset ( see sect  2.2.3 ) . from the measured width of unresolved arc lines",
    ", we estimate that the spectral resolution is on order @xmath0 ( 8.5 km  s@xmath28 ) , nominal for the 2-pixel wide slit used in our set - up .",
    "we also obtained spectra of the fabry - perrot `` etalon '' lamp which produces a spectrum with @xmath30 emission lines equally spaced in frequency in each order .      all steps in the data reduction",
    "were performed with iraf tasks .",
    "the raw spectra were first sky - subtracted using a sky spectrum or , if it yielded too large or too small a residual background level , another spectrum of the same object with the star(s ) at a different location . a constant value per detector quadrant",
    "was then removed to correct for small bias differences in the four amplifiers .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded using the normalized difference between the `` on '' and `` off '' halogen lamp spectra and finally corrected for bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "once these cosmetic corrections were performed , we separated each order in the spectrum using windows that encompass each of them with all of their corresponding sky area .",
    "we then corrected each order for distortion using the spectra of bright stars and of the etalon lamp lines to track the curvature of the spatial and spectral axes , respectively .",
    "after the distortion correction , the 2-dimension spectra have the spatial axis vertical and the spectral axis horizontal .",
    "the spectra of single stars , such as the radial velocity standard or the a - type stars used for atmospheric corrections , were extracted using a @xmath1204 aperture centered on the star . for ttaus , this was not practical as the spectra of the primary overlaps significantly on the position of the secondary and vice - versa .",
    "both stars must be carefully deblended to obtain uncontaminated spectra .",
    "we used a custom - made routine that , for each pixel along the spectral axis of each order , fits two gaussian profiles of equal width along the spatial axis . because the core of the ao - produced psf is not a perfect gaussian , this fit is not perfect and some contamination of one component by the other is unavoidable .",
    "we find that , depending on wavelength and ao correction , the spectrum of the fainter component ( ttausa ) can be under- or over - estimated by up to 10% although in most cases this effect does not exceed a few percent .",
    "lorentzian profiles were also tested but they result in noisier and more contaminated spectra .    to correct the extracted 1-dimensional spectra for telluric absorption , we used the spectra of the a - type stars , which intrinsically contain essentially no photospheric line , except for the hi br@xmath11 line ( in order # 2 ) which is spectrally resolved over @xmath31100 pixels given the typical rotational velocities of such objects ( @xmath32 km  s@xmath28 ) .",
    "the many narrow features observed in the spectra of the a - type stars are therefore unresolved telluric absorption features .",
    "we fitted a 2030@xmath33 order polynomial function to the continuum ( and hydrogen line ) across each order and divided the observed spectrum by this `` continuum '' .",
    "this yielded the telluric transmission function , which we normalized at unity between absorption lines .",
    "the spectra of ttaus  and hd35410 were then divided , order by order , by their corresponding telluric transmission function to yield the final spectra used in our analysis .",
    "the final spectra have signal - to - noise ratios on order 6090 for ttausa  and 90120 for both ttausb  and hd35410 , as estimated from the standard deviation of the counts within several featureless continuum windows .",
    "too few afterglow oh lines were present even in our 300s individual exposures to derive an accurate wavelength solution .",
    "we therefore relied on the identification of a few ( between 2 and 7 ) known arc lines in each order .",
    "we used each independent pair of lines to estimate the pixel size ( in km  s@xmath28 ) in separate sections of all orders .",
    "we found no significant systematic variations at the @xmath34% level within or between the orders .",
    "the average spectral pixel size for each order are listed in table[tab : setup ] ; the average and standard deviation over all orders is @xmath35.31@xmath200.11 km  s@xmath28/pixel .    for each order",
    ", the wavelength solution was calculated as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the running pixel number starting at 0 .",
    "the values of @xmath38 listed in table[tab : setup ] are the average values over all identified lines in each order .",
    "since orders # 3 and # 5 contains the largest number of identified arc lines ( 4 and 7 , respectively ) , we used the dispersion of @xmath38 to estimate that the accuracy of our absolute wavelength calibration is on order 15 km  s@xmath28 ; this is dominated by uncertainties on the exact rest wavelength of the arc lamp lines and on the approximative nature of the adopted wavelength solution . for all other orders",
    ", we assume that the uncertainty is the same .",
    "the frequency difference between any two consecutive etalon lamp lines was found to be constant throughout the orders at the 2.5% level , confirming the validity of our wavelength solution .    given the uncertainty in our absolute wavelength calibration , it is not possible to determine radial velocities directly from the measured wavelength of spectral features .",
    "rather , we used cross - correlation with the spectrum of hd35410 , which takes full advantage of the many photospheric features located in the @xmath15 band . using entire orders in the cross - correlations yields relative pixel shifts that are accurate to within 0.2 pixel ( @xmath39 km  s@xmath28 ,",
    "see sect .",
    "we then transformed the pixel shifts into velocity shifts using the spectral pixel size defined above and , correcting for the earth motion using the iraf task _ rvcorr _ ( the correction is on order 6.5 km  s@xmath28 ) , we derived the heliocentric radial velocity of each source . since the radial velocity of hd35410 is known to within 0.7 km  s@xmath28 ( fehrenbach & duflot 1980 ) , the cross - correlation technique therefore provides an accurate estimate of the radial velocity of the components of ttaus .",
    "ttaun has not shown signs of near - infrared variability over the last decade ( beck et al . 2004 ) , and we assumed that it was at its stable level in all bands at the time of our observations and br@xmath11  narrow band filters as for the broad band @xmath15 filter . ] .",
    "we therefore adopt the following photometry for ttaun : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 ; beck et al . 2004 ) . with this simultaneous photometric reference , we can study the variability of both ttausa  and ttausb .",
    "the images presented in figure[fig : images ] show that , at the time of both our observations , ttausa  was the faintest component of the ttau triple system at 1.6 and 2.2@xmath1 m , in contrast to all spatially resolved measurements of the system prior to 2002 ( koresko 2000 ; duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) . as shown in figure[fig : var ] , ttausais now @xmath123mag fainter ( @xmath44 ) and much redder ( @xmath45 ) than it was at the time of the first images that spatially resolved the triple system ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 in november 2000 , duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) . in late 2002 , ttausa  brightened by 1.7magnitude at @xmath15 band over only 2 months , indicating large variability on short timescale . at longer wavelengths , we also find ttausa  to be fainter than ttaun , and the entire ttaus  binary system has reached its lowest @xmath23 flux since dyck et al .",
    "( 1982 ) s discovery observations ( @xmath48 ; see beck et al .",
    "2004 ) . at @xmath24 ,",
    "the combined ttaus  system was 0.4mag fainter than ttaun , while all historical measurements found ttaus  to clearly dominate the flux from the system at 4.7@xmath1 m ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 ; herbst et al .",
    "the possible physical cause(s ) of this variability will be discussed in sect .",
    "5 .    while ttausa  is undergoing a rapid dimming trend since late 2000 ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) , ttausb  has varied in a much more moderate way ( see figure[fig : var ] ) .",
    "its @xmath15 band brightness has increased from @xmath49 ( koresko 2000 ) to @xmath50 ( duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) between 1997 and 2000 and , since then , it has stabilized around @xmath51 . between november 2000 and december 2003 , it has also somewhat brightened in @xmath25 band , from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , so that its @xmath54 color index has only changed by 0.2mag .    from this comparison ,",
    "it is clear that the photometric behavior of both components of ttaus  is dramatically different and can not be explained with the same model .",
    "furthermore , since most historic photometric measurements of the unresolved ttaus  system have yielded @xmath55 , it is likely that ttausa  dominated most of these measurements and that the strong historic variability of the system is primarily related to ttausa , a conclusion also supported by the astrometric motion of ttaus  ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) .      from a lower spectral resolution 2@xmath1",
    "m spectrum taken in november 2000 , we had placed a lower limit of @xmath56mag to the extinction toward our line of sight to ttausb , conservatively assuming that the excess was negligible in the @xmath25 band ( duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) . since muzerolle et al .",

    "the method consists in using simultaneous photometry of ttausb  in two near - infrared bands ( @xmath25 and @xmath15 or @xmath15 and @xmath23 here ) , estimating the continuum excess contribution ( `` veiling '' ) at one of these wavelengths from a spectrum , and separating the stellar and excess brightnesses using their known spectral dependence .",

    "band spectrum has already revealed many photospheric features from ttausb  ( duchne et al .",
    "our new , higher resolution spectrum also reveals the @xmath18co bandheads from this object , as well as a suite of individual transitions between them ( see figure[fig : spec_co ] ) .",
    "because our radial velocity standard giant template is of too early spectral type with respect to ttausb , its spectrum contains less photospheric features , which have different strengths than that of later type dwarves ( wallace & hinkle 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , the co bandheads are the only significant features that are in common to both spectra .",
    "conveniently , m0m1 dwarves and g8k0 giants show co bandheads of essentially the same strength .",
    "we can therefore compare the strength of these features in ttausb  and hd35410 ( spectral types m0.5 and g9iii , respectively ) to estimate the amount of veiling in the extincted tts . to match the shape of the bandheads in the two objects , we needed to convolve the spectrum of the slowly rotating giant by a 6pixel fwhm gaussian profile , suggesting a rotational velocity of @xmath88 km  s@xmath28 for ttausb .",
    "after this convolution , we find the bandheads in ttausb  to be about three times too weak , which implies that the veiling in dec 2003 was @xmath59 , similar to its level in nov 2002 .",
    "this could be related to the negligible changes observed for the accretion rate on this source .",
    "besides the molecular and atomic emission lines ( sect .  4.1 and 4.2 ) and gaseous co absorption lines ( sect .  4.4 ) , the spectrum of ttausa  is remarkably featureless in all orders , despite its high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the tentative , very weak @xmath810 rovibrational @xmath18co bandhead at 2.29@xmath1 m in the spectrum of ttausa  is most likely an artifact due to contamination by the spectrum of ttausb .",
    "indeed , if this feature was real , then the other bandheads should be detected at roughly similar strengths , which is not the case .",
    "we therefore conclude that no photospheric feature typical of late - type stars has been detected in the spectrum of ttausa  despite our use of a much higher resolution than ever before for this source .",
    "while the spectrum of ttausa  in orders # 4 and # 5 reveals no significant @xmath18co bandheads , it shows a series of well - defined narrow absorption lines ( figure[fig : spec_co ] ) .",
    "these features , which are not detected in ttausb  and do not line up with telluric absorption features , can not be the result of an improper telluric correction .",
    "therefore , they are intrinsic to ttausa . their non - detection in our previous lower resolution spectrum of this object ( duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) can be well explained by their weakness and narrowness .    comparing the spectrum of ttausa  with that of hd35410",
    ", it appears that all absorption lines detected in the former are also present in the latter .",
    "consequently , they are @xmath18co transitions . indeed , we could identify all of them using the high - spectral resolution atlas of wallace & hinkle ( 1996 ) .",

    "in normal photospheres all these lines have essentially the same strength due to saturation effects and the series extend bluewards towards the 2.293@xmath1 m bandhead .",

    "we discuss this further in sect  5.2 . for now , we focus on ttausa , which we have shown behaves in a much more dramatic fashion and presents peculiar properties that have lead to its irc classification .",
    "the most important result of our high spectral resolution study is the discovery of the presence of warm co gas in our line of sight to ttausa .",
    "because these absorption features are not detected in front of ttausb  and because the derived gas temperature is as high as @xmath12390k , this gas has to be located within only a few au of the central source .",
    "it is therefore part of the circum_stellar _ material of ttausa .",
    "the fact that the co absorption features are very narrow ( @xmath122 km  s@xmath28 ) implies a dynamically stable configuration , with no significant infalling or outflowing motion . a compact envelope around ttausa  would evolve on a short dynamical timescale and",
    "should show large positive or negative radial velocity ( depending on whether it is in infall or outflow motion ) since the free - fall velocity at 5au of a low - mass star is larger than 10 km  s@xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the circumstellar material of ttausa  can not be distributed in a roughly spherical geometry .",
    "the simplest geometry to maintain the gas at a single radial velocity is an edge - on circumstellar disk , in which the gas intercepted by our line of sight is exclusively in tangential keplerian motion ; namely such material presents no radial velocity motion .",
    "if the collimated jet that lies in the plane of the sky indeed arises from ttaus  ( solf & bhm 1999 ) , the fact that ttausa  may be surrounded by an edge - on disk appears as no surprise .",
    "the small size of this disk is naturally explained by the disruptive tidal forces exerted by ttausb  through its orbital motion ( e.g. , artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "the actual radius of the disk is likely to be on order 23au given the binary periastron distance ( johnston et al .",
    "2004 ; beck et al .",
    "the orbital period at the outer edge of the disk is on order of a few years at most , and our line of sight intercepts a different section of the disk within just a few weeks .",
    "the variability could therefore be explained by asymmetries within the disk , with alternatively thicker and thinner parts that move in front of us and away as the disk rotates .",
    "given its size , this clearly is a different structure than the much larger absorbing screen found by walter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and that we discuss in sect .  5.2 .",
    "note that , since both ttaun  and ttausb  posses their own circumstellar disks but are not in an edge - on configuration , the three disks in this system are not parallel to each other , as already found other ttauri multiple systems ( e.g. , stapelfeldt et al . 1998b ) .",
    "if there is indeed a small edge - on disk around ttausa , can it explain the peculiar properties of this irc ?",
    "in particular , the featureless near - infrared spectrum , the strong variability in near - infrared brightness and color on a timescale of a few weeks only , the variable br@xmath11 ew tracing the accretion phenomenon , and the high linear polarization rate derived by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) must be accounted for .",
    "if the optical depth of the disk through its midplane is large ( @xmath123 ) , then we can only receive scattered light off the outer surface of the disk , as in other t tauri edge - on disk systems ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disk opacity is small , then we receive transmitted light from both the central star and the inner rim of the disk , attenuated by the disk self - absorption .",
    "the high linear polarization rate favors a pure scattering regime , but none of the known edge - on disk shows as large a photometric variability as ttausa  does .",
    "a finer analysis is therefore required to derive a consistent model for this source .",
    "when ttausa  fades , it also becomes much redder .",
    "this behavior , also pointed out by beck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the unresolved ttaus  system over a period during which the irc probably dominated the system in the near - infrared , suggests a change in obscuration as the main cause of the source variability .",
    "the large color change experienced by ttausawhen its flux varies shows that scattering is not the dominant phenomenon , as the latter introduces no time - dependent color changes .",
    "we therefore suggest that the edge - on disk surrounding ttausais only slightly or moderately opaque , with a near - infrared optical depth @xmath124 no larger than a few when the object is brightest .",
    "this moderate opacity ensures that scattering does not dominate in the bright state while changes of opacity of a few remain reasonable : the observed 3magnitude drop in @xmath15 band brightness for ttausa  implies an increase in opacity by @xmath125 at that wavelength . yet , with an opacity of a few in the near - infrared , scattering may account for a non - negligible fraction of the object s total flux , thereby leading to a linear polarization rate of a few percent , as observed by kobayashi et al .",
    "we note that the column density of warm co we have derived implies @xmath126 assuming interstellar gas - to - dust and @xmath18co / h@xmath17 abundance ratios . while this may be slightly too large , this is nonetheless in good agreement with the idea that the disk is only moderately optically thick .",
    "the @xmath127 band variability does not follow this `` redder when fainter '' trend , as already suggested by the multi - wavelength amplitude of the 1990 flare : ghez et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found that @xmath128mag @xmath127 band variations accompanied an equal amplitude @xmath15 band flare whereas @xmath129 for interstellar matter ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "furthermore , comparing a recent november 1999 @xmath127 band measurement ( mccabe 2004 ; mccabe et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) to the late 1990 measurements of ghez et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , we find that between the two observations , ttaus  has brightened by @xmath130mag in @xmath15 ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) whereas it has",
    "_ faded _ by @xmath131mag in @xmath127 . in both epochs ,",
    "ttaus  was near its maximum brightness and , therefore , presumably dominated by ttausa . clearly , variable obscuration can not account alone for the variability of ttausa .",
    "we propose that the near - infrared light comes from the central source and/or the innermost regions of the circumstellar disk , and is therefore partially absorbed by the outer parts of the disk whereas the 10@xmath1 m emission comes from further out , close to the outer edge of the small disk .",
    "this way , the fluctuations of both wavelengths may not be correlated .",
    "variability in the @xmath127 band would arise from a changing amount of material located toward the observer beyond @xmath121au of the central star , possibly because of outer spiral structures triggered by the orbital motion of ttausb , for instance .    with the proposed geometry for ttausa ,",
    "the light we receive is a combination of starlight and inner disk emission , both of them suffering from absorption by the disk itself .",
    "the absence of low - mass star photospheric features in the spectrum of ttausa  either means that the central star is intrinsically featureless , implying a spectral type between late b and mid - f or so , or that the disk emission is much larger than that of the star itself . in the latter case , the object would be a fuori - like object , but our spectrum does not show the rotationally broadened @xmath18co bandheads typical of these objects ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) , making this interpretation unlikely .",
    "we therefore favor an intermediate - to - early spectral type for ttausa , making it the earliest type and consequently highest mass component of the ttau triple system .    in its historically brightest state , in late 1999",
    ", ttausa  was 0.5mag fainter at @xmath15 than ttaun  ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) , which in fact implies that ttausa  was the brightest component of the system by about 1mag once the @xmath74mag extinction screen in front of ttaus  is taken into account estimate and brightest @xmath15 magnitude are not simultaneous . however , at the time of our first @xmath132 estimate , in late 2000 , ttausa  was only 0.8mag fainter than ttaun  at @xmath15 .",
    "at that time , the dereddened flux of ttausa  was therefore still larger than that of ttaun  by a factor of @xmath128 . ] .",
    "despite its non - detection at visible wavelengths , ttausa  is therefore intrinsically very bright in the near - infrared , at least at times , especially when one considers that the extinction to ttausa  is likely to be larger than that to ttausb . in fact , at the epochs when ttausa  was as bright as @xmath133 ( dereddened ) , it was the second brightest near - infrared source in the entire taurus star - forming region after abaur , a 80@xmath4 b9 herbig be star ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "in other words , ttausa  is most likely one of the highest mass object in the taurus star - forming region even though it is not optically detected .    from this set of converging pieces of evidence",
    ", we suggest that ttausais an intermediate mass star with a 23au - radius edge - on disk that is partially transparent in the near - infrared",
    ". a 2.53@xmath5 stellar mass would be consistent with an early spectral type as well as a bright intrinsic near - infrared brightness based on the observed properties of abaur .",
    "the current lower limit to the dynamical mass of the system ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) is also consistent with such a mass estimate for ttausa .",
    "another consistent argument is the gas temperature we derived in sect .  4.4 : the temperature resulting from direct illumination by a 9000k photosphere is on order 270k at 3au .",
    "an intermediate mass star would have a luminosity of several tens of @xmath4 , much larger than the bolometric luminosity of ttausa .",
    "this apparent light deficit could be explained by a combination of two factors .",
    "first , the edge - on disk scatters a large fraction of the optical and near - infrared starlight away from our line of sight . in the case of hh30 ,",
    "wood et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that only 10% of the intrinsic starlight reaches the observer , resulting in a largely underestimated bolometric luminosity .",
    "the disk surrounding ttausa  is however only partially opaque , and so the luminosity loss is probably not as dramatic .",
    "the second factor is the presence of a foreground absorbing screen which also scatters light away from the observer ( cf .",
    "5.2 ) . either way",
    ", the basic argument is that the extinguishing material around ttausa  is not spherically symmetric and therefore our bolometric luminosity estimate , largely driven by the unextincted mid - infrared photometry , is only a lower limit to the object s actual luminosity .      the derived temperature ( @xmath134k ) and density ( @xmath135@xmath99 ) allow to estimate the disk mass , when they are compared with predictions of the disk structure .",
    "indeed , the derived temperature and density compare remarkably well with the disk structure predicted by the model by dullemond & dominik ( 2004 ) . assuming that the disk is illuminated by a 80@xmath136 central star , following the arguments presented above",
    ", a disk with a radius of 3 au and a mass of 0.003 m@xmath137 would have a warm layer of co at about the observed density and temperature ( c. dominik , private communication ) .",
    "the disk would be seen at an inclination angle of about 80 , i.e. , almost but not exactly edge - on .",
    "the disk mass inferred from this model is much larger than the value we have derived from the co column density because we do not intercept the disk midplane , which would be markedly cooler ( around 150k ) , and , hence , we do not intercept the bulk of the disk mass with our observations .",
    "however , the inferred disk mass is satisfyingly lower than the upper limit on the ttaus  disk mass derived by akeson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in practice , this comparison with a theoretical structure suggests that the disk is not seen exactly edge - on but through material located at moderate elevation above the disk midplane .",
    "this makes ttausa  a rare and precious source where absorption studies of the molecular content can be carried out , because the disk is not exactly edge - on , which would result in all received photons being scattered rather than transmitted through the disk .",
    "a more detailed physical model of the disk surrounding ttausa  is not within the scope of the present study but would greatly help refining our understanding of this object .",
    "the upper limits on the ammonia and methane abundances ( @xmath138 ) are relatively stringent when compared to theoretical expectations .",
    "both ammonia and methane are believed to be formed on the grain surfaces , by active grain chemistry ( tielens & hagen 1982 ) , and have indeed been observed in the solid form with abundances around @xmath139 ( e.g. boogert et al .",
    "1996 ; dartois et al . 1998 ; alexander et al . 2003 ) . in the region where we observed warm co , the dust temperature is certainly large enough to make the grain mantles sublimate . therefore , the mantle components are injected into the gas phase , and ammonia and methane are no exception . for this reason",
    ", one would expect that the same amount of ammonia and methane seen in the ices are found in the gas phase .",
    "this is the case , for example , of ammonia whose gas phase has been measured to be of order of @xmath139 in the hot cores of massive protostars and in the protostellar outflows ( e.g. , bachiller 1996 ; krutz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the same applies to methane , whose gas phase abundance in the massive hot cores has been measured to be more than @xmath140 ( e.g. boogert , blake & oberg 2004 ) .",
    "so , why we do not detect ammonia and methane at a level larger than @xmath117 ?",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "it is possible that the grain mantles around ttausa  have a different composition than the other mentioned environments , and are less enriched of ammonia and methane .",
    "alternatively , chemical reactions could have removed the two molecules to form more complex molecules , which is expected in some cases in the hot cores ( e.g. charnley , tielens & millar 1992 ) .",
    "both explanations are plausible , and would have , if confirmed , interesting implications .",
    "for example , the abundance of ammonia in ices traces back to the conditions where the ices formed , namely during the pre - collapse phase , unless a vigorous reprocessing occurred during the disk phase .",
    "further , and more sensitive observations are in need to fully explore these possibilities and the linked consequences .",
    "we have found ttausb  to be extincted by about @xmath74mag at the time of our observations , a value that changed little over the last few years .",
    "this number is similar to the extinction derived from the ice absorption feature by beck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , suggesting that both approaches probe the same physical structure . estimating the depth of the mid - infrared silicate absorption feature from three narrow - band photometric measurements , ghez et al .",
    "( 1991 ) estimated @xmath141mag only .",
    "more recently , herbst , robberto & beckwith ( 1997 ) found the silicate feature to be almost twice as deep , bringing this extinction estimate closer to the other ones .",
    "we note , however , that the depth of the 10@xmath1 m silicate feature only poorly correlates with @xmath132 in molecular clouds ( e.g. , whittet et al .",
    "still , a consistent picture of the system can be proposed based on the convergent estimates of the amount of extincting gaseous and solid materials .",
    "as readily suggested by the non - detection of either component at visible wavelengths , there seems to be an @xmath74mag obscuring cloud in front of the entire ttaus  system , which we believe to be the structure seen in absorption by walter et al .",
    "this structure , whose size is about 07@xmath305 , is much too large to correspond to a circumstellar disk around either star given their small separation .",
    "it is quite possible that this is a circumbinary envelope or thick disk ( _  la _ ggtau , guilloteau , dutrey & simon 1999 ) that obscure both components .",
    "if its inner radius is at least 50au ( or @xmath12035 ) , it is stable with respect to the orbital motion of the inner tight binary system whereas its outer radius is probably set by the motion of ttaun , which is located far away enough to generate only little perturbation to such a structure ( walter et al .",
    "such a large size for the obscuring screen is also consistent with the presence of ice and silicate absorption features : only that far from the central star is the material cold enough to produce significant absorption in these features . on the other hand , the warm co absorption features we have found in the spectrum of ttausacannot be associated with this screen , since the gas temperature 50au from a source with a few times 10@xmath4 luminosity is not higher than @xmath142k .",
    "we have shown that the molecular hydrogen emission from ttaus  is spatially resolved over 2  around the system and does not arise from the stars themselves .",
    "the linear accelerations observed in the position - velocity diagram are reminiscent of propagating jets ( e.g. , hirth , mundt & solf 1997 ) ; however , the presence of blue - shifted components _ on both sides _ of the system and the narrowness of the line profiles at any spatial location argues against the emission line being excited in shocked regions of a single jet . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial coincidence between ultraviolet fluorescent line emission with the infrared line emission we detect to the west of the system argues for a similar emission mechanism ; however , no ultraviolet emission seems to be directly associated with the infrared emission we detect east of the tight binary system .",
    "it is not possible to conclude on the nature of the excitation mechanism on the basis of our observations only ; similar observations with different slit orientations , or integral field spectroscopic observations , would be required to determine the exact nature of the h@xmath17 emission . in any case ,",
    "our observations reveal the complex kinematic and spatial structure of the gas surrounding ttaus .",
    "we have used the ao - fed cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph nirspec on keck  ii to obtain the first high spatial ( 005 ) and spectral ( @xmath0 ) resolution 2@xmath1 m view of the mysterious tight binary system ttaus  by aligning the entry slit along the position angle of the binary .",
    "we have further obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7@xmath1 m broadband images that resolve all three components of the ttau multiple system , as well as new 1.6 and 2.2@xmath1 m images .",
    "the spectrum of ttausb  confirms that it is a low - mass tts with significant excess emission from its circumstellar disk .",
    "its very red near - infrared colors can be explained by a roughly constant extinction on order @xmath74mag , in agreement with previous extinction measurements based on ice and silicate features .",
    "we believe that the obscuring material is located in a @xmath3150au - sized circumbinary structure , whose absorption was also recently detected in the ultraviolet .",
    "the spectrum of ttausa , on the other hand , is featureless , with the notable exceptions of i ) a weak and variable br@xmath11 emission that probably traces accretion on the central star , and ii ) a series of narrow @xmath18co rovibrational absorption lines without their corresponding bandhead .",
    "a rotational diagram shows that the co lines correspond to a moderate column density of gas at a temperature on order 390k . to account for this high temperature and in the absence of evidence for infall or outflow in the gas ,",
    "we believe that this material is located in a small ( 23au in radius ) edge - on disk that surround an intermediate - mass star . the large variability of ttausa  in both near - infrared brightness and color can not be uniquely accounted for by changes in the amount of line of sight extinction .",
    "rather , we propose that the disk around ttausa  is moderately opaque ( @xmath143a few ) and that our line of sight intercept alternatively thicker and thinner sections of the disks as its outer radius rotates around the central star in just a few years .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the spatial and kinematic properties of the molecular gas in the vicinity of ttaus , as traced by molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "we find an unusual structure in that the emission appears to gradually blueshift with distance to the stars on both sides of the binary .",
    "the exact nature of the excitation mechanism remains unknown but these results confirm the highly complex structure of the gaseous material surrounding the ttau system .",

    "<S> we have obtained the first high spatial ( 005 ) and spectral ( @xmath0 ) resolution 2@xmath1 m spectrum of the ttaus  tight binary system using adaptive optics on the keck  ii telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7@xmath1 m images that resolve the three components of the ttau multiple system , as well as new 1.6 and 2.2@xmath1 m images . together with its very red near - infrared colors , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of ttausb  shows that this ttauri star is extincted by a roughly constant extinction of @xmath215mag , which is probably the 07@xmath305 circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in the ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> ttausa , which is also observed through this screen and is actively accreting , further possesses a small edge - on disk that is evidenced by warm ( 390k ) , narrow overtone co rovibrational absorption features in our spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ttausa  is most likely an intermediate - mass star surrounded by a semi - transparent 23au - radius disk whose asymmetries and short keplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source on relatively short timescales . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that molecular hydrogen emission exclusively arises from the gas that surrounds ttaus  and that its spatial and kinematic structure , while providing suggestive evidence for a jet - like structure , is highly complex . </S>"
