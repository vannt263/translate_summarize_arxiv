    "continuous - wave ( cw ) high - power blue light generation is a key issue for many applications such as laser printing , rgb color display or for spectroscopy and cooling of atomic species . due to the limited power and tunability of gas lasers ( ar@xmath7 , hecd ) or newly developed blue diode laser sources in the blue - uv spectrum  @xcite ,",
    "the usual procedure is to upconvert near - ir solid - state or semi - conductor diode lasers either internal to the laser resonator  @xcite or in external enhancement resonators  @xcite . in the latter scheme ,",
    "the efficiency of the upconversion is usually measured in terms of the ratio @xmath8 of the generated second - harmonic ( sh ) power to the fundamental field ( ff ) power which is mode - matched to the resonator .",
    "several nonlinear materials can upconvert such lasers , using either temperature - tuned or angular birefringence phase - matching .",
    "the most widely used one is the large nonlinearity ( @xmath9pm / v ) potassium niobate ( knbo@xmath10 ) crystal  @xcite . for temperature - tuned noncritical phase - matching ,",
    "the major drawback of knbo@xmath10 is the occurrence of a phase transition leading to repoling near @xmath11c  @xcite , which restricts upconversion to laser wavelengths longer than @xmath12 nm . for laser cooling of the @xmath13 strontium line at 461  nm , which is the target of the present work ,",
    "the use of a non - critically phase - matched knbo@xmath10 at @xmath14c is hence not recommended . for shorter ff wavelengths ,",
    "critical phase - matching at room - temperature is possible but results in a deleterious beam walk - off ( @xmath15 ) of the blue wave  leading to elliptical beam shape or even higher - order transverse patterns  @xcite  combined with a narrow temperature bandwidth ( @xmath16c )  @xcite . as an additional drawback ,",
    "knbo@xmath10 is subject to blue - induced photo - chromic damage known as bliira ( blue - induced infrared absorption  @xcite ) .",
    "this nonlinear loss mechanism , together with the associated thermal lensing , has limited the highest reported conversion efficiency to @xmath17 , yielding @xmath18mw of blue power at @xmath19 nm from a nd : yag laser power @xmath20mw  @xcite .",
    "alternative widely used materials are lib@xmath10o@xmath21 ( lbo ) or @xmath22-bab@xmath23o@xmath24 ( bbo )  @xcite but the low nonlinear coefficients of oxoborate crystals ( @xmath25pm / v ) are not suited to the frequency conversion of low power sources because it requires a tight control of the round - trip intracavity loss down to @xmath26 .",
    "recently , we employed a critically phase - matched ktp in a doubly - resonant sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) of a nd : yag laser and a low - power algaas diode laser at 813 nm to produce 120 mw of 461 nm light , but the conversion efficiency ( @xmath27 ) was limited by the strong power imbalance of the two pump sources  @xcite . to allow a more efficient cooling of atomic strontium , a new powerful and more convenient blue source from direct second - harmonic generation ( shg ) of a master - oscillator - power - amplifier ( algaas - mopa ) delivering an output power of @xmath28mw",
    "was then constructed .",
    "but unlike in the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite that uses a critically phase - matched knbo@xmath10 semi - monolithic resonator to generate the same wavelength , we made our choice on periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) .",
    "electric - field poled quasi - phase - matched ( qpm ) oxide ferroelectrics such as ppln ( periodically - poled lithium niobate ) and ppktp have recently super - seeded the previous birefringence phase - matched materials for visible light generation  @xcite owing to their much higher effective nonlinearities ( @xmath29pm / v and @xmath30pm / v ) .",
    "furthermore qpm materials are intrinsically free of walkoff . for blue generation ,",
    "ppktp is preferred to ppln which exhibits strong photorefractive damage when used at room - temperature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an intra - cavity ppktp frequency - doubled nd : yag laser yielded an output power of @xmath18mw at @xmath19 nm with an internal efficiency of 5.5% .",
    "green light power of @xmath31mw was generated by juwiler _",
    "et al _ from @xmath32mw of cw nd : yag laser with an efficiency of @xmath33 in a semi - monolithic standing - wave resonator , limited by strong thermal lensing effects induced by the 532 nm residual absorption  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a mopa diode laser ( @xmath34w ) similar to ours generated @xmath35mw of blue light at @xmath36 nm in a ring enhancement cavity , a value comparable to that obtained using a similar semi - conductor laser , at identical wavelength , in a semi - monolithic standing - wave knbo@xmath10 resonator  @xcite .",
    "however due to the lower uv bandgap energy of ktp , linear absorption becomes an issue at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm .",
    "a detailed absorption measurement of flux - grown or hydrothermally - grown ktp in the spectral range from the bandgap wavelength ( 365 nm ) to 600 nm revealed a large fluctuation from sample to sample  @xcite . at 473 nm for instance ,",
    "values of @xmath37 ranging from 0.034 to @xmath38@xmath39 were reported . in a recent closely - related ppktp - shg experiment pumped at 846 nm ,",
    "a value @xmath40@xmath39 has been measured  @xcite .",
    "strong thermal lensing effects  @xcite arising from the blue absorption was the main limitation of their power efficiency scaling in genuine cw operation ( @xmath41 , corresponding to 225 mw of 423 nm power for 375mw of mode - matched ti : sapphire laser ) .",
    "higher blue power ( 400 mw ) could be obtained for the same circulating power of @xmath42w only in pulsed fringe - scanning mode that allows more efficient heat dissipation within the ppktp crystal .",
    "such a severe limitation in cw operation actually arised from the tight focusing used ( @xmath43 m , corresponding to the theoretical optimum of the single - pass efficiency for the ppktp crystal length @xmath44 mm  ) and the associated thermal lens power which scales as @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "in true cw operation , the thermal focal length ( which can be as short as a few cm , see section  [ sec : thermal ] ) experienced by the circulating fundamental power impedes efficient mode - and - impedance matching of the input beam . for a symmetric linear resonator for instance",
    ", thermal lensing has been shown to be responsible for the clamping of the circulating power to a low critical value @xmath46 corresponding to the collapse of the secondary thermally - induced waists  @xcite .    in the present experiment , we deliberately avoid optimal single - pass focusing to circumvent these thermal lensing effects . in section  [ sec :",
    "analysis ] we show that owing to the large nonlinearity of ppktp , one does nt require extremely low intra - cavity linear losses to maintain the conversion efficiency constant over a wide range of focusing parameters .",
    "the latter is defined by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ppktp length and @xmath49 is the rayleigh range of the cavity mode .",
    "we find that loose focusing to @xmath50 m in a @xmath51 mm long ppktp crystal still results in a large single - pass efficiency @xmath52w@xmath53 and in a stable cw operation of the resonant cavity at the maximum available mode - matched power of @xmath54mw with no evidence of serious lensing effect .",
    "using such a strategy , blue power scaling to half a watt should be possible with @xmath55 w of mode - matched input power .    in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we briefly describe the experimental setup , highlighting some measurement procedures aimed at an accurate determination of important parameters such as the mode - matching factor @xmath56 or the circulating power @xmath57 .",
    "section  [ sec : gamma ] is devoted to the intracavity measurement of the conversion efficiency that determines the final enhancement efficiency , taking profit of the tem@xmath58 resonator mode filtering of the fundamental mopa laser non - gaussian beam and making use of the accurate evaluation of the gaussian beam shg focusing function @xmath59  @xcite . from these measurements",
    ", we derive a consistent value of the @xmath60 nonlinear tensor element of ktp .",
    "the comparison of the recorded temperature tuning curve with the functional dependence given by two of the most recently published linear and thermo - optic dispersion relations of ktp  @xcite shows a perfect agreement between theory and experiment , providing thus a stringent validation test of those dispersion relations for ppktp in the blue / near - ir spectrum . having determined all the relevant parameters , we then present ( section  [ sec : resonant ] ) the resonant enhancement results which are in good agreement with the theoretical expectation , with a record efficiency of @xmath4 .",
    "the paper ends with a brief thermal effects analysis ( section  [ sec : thermal ] ) which supports that the experiment is indeed not limited by thermal effects .",
    "we start by investigating the dependence of the power conversion efficiency on the focusing parameter @xmath61 . at zero cavity detuning",
