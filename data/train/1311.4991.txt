    "magnetic fields play an important role in the present day universe .",
    "they pervade entire galaxies including our own milky way  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations of tev blazars with fermi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide hints about the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "the question , however , where these fields come from is still not conclusively answered , in particular how were the magnetic fields initially generated , and how amplified to the strength observed nowadays .",
    "the first seed magnetic fields in the early universe could have been generated by a couple of different mechanisms .",
    "one mechanism is the generation of magnetic fields in the phase of inflation in the very early universe resulting in a field strength of @xmath7  @xmath8",
    "g on scales of about 1 mpc @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the generation via first order phase transitions , with field strengths of @xmath9 g from the electroweak phase transition and @xmath10 g from the qcd phase transition on scales of 10 mpc @xcite .",
    "the actual coherence length , however , depends crucially on the properties of the field , like e.g. the magnetic helicity and the spectral index of the magnetic power spectrum on large scales  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another process is the so - called `` biermann battery '' @xcite where due to the different behaviour of electrons and ions in a plasma magnetic fields with @xmath11 g can be generated .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that plasma fluctuations can generate magnetic fields of the order of @xmath8 g even in a completely unmagnetized , non - relativistic medium .",
    "for comparison , in present day galaxies kpc - scale magnetic fields with strengths of a few @xmath12 g are found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason at some point a significant amplification of primordial magnetic fields on large scales has to take place .",
    "one way to accomplish this is the magnetic dynamo which amplifies the magnetic field on various scales , which is why the effects on large and small scales are usually considered separately . on large scales",
    "the so - called mean - field dynamo describes the amplification in a differentially rotating fluid in the presence of helical turbulent motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on scales smaller than the driving scale of turbulence",
    "the small - scale dynamo is responsible for the amplification of the magnetic field by converting the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy by stretching and twisting magnetic field lines @xcite . in the so - called kinematic phase of the small - scale dynamo the magnetic energy experiences an exponential growth mainly at the resistivity scale . once the magnetic field has grown to a significant strength , the non - linear phase sets in , in which the magnetic energy is transported to larger and larger scales @xcite .",
    "the amplification ends once the magnetic field has reached saturation , i.e. when the magnetic energy is of the order of 10% of the turbulent kinetic energy on the driving scale of the turbulence .",
    "the formation of the first stars , so called population iii stars ( hereafter pop iii stars ) , in the universe has taken place in dark matter halos with typical masses of 10@xmath2 m@xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by means of an analytical consideration",
    ", @xcite have shown that the small - scale dynamo can amplify an initially very weak magnetic field in such a halo to strengths of @xmath13 g within short timescales , a mechanism which could also work during the formation of the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "these analytical predictions were recently confirmed by a number of numerical simulations of pop iii star formation @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that when using a high enough spatial resolution the magnetic field in the center of the halo indeed can reach saturation .",
    "these magnetic fields are usually small - scaled , strongly tangled , and localized in the center of the star forming halos . for this reason",
    ", the field can not contribute to the large - scale , volume - filling magnetic field observed nowadays unless it is removed from the center and transported to larger scales .",
    "as shown by @xcite , pop iii stars with masses between 10 and 50 m@xmath4 will end their lives with a core collapse supernova and those with masses from 140 to 260 m@xmath4 with an up to 100 times more energetic pair instability supernova .",
    "the effect of supernova explosions on primordial halos was studies numerically by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "a common result of these simulations is that whether a halo is disrupted by a supernova or not crucially depends on the mass of the halo , the injection energy of the supernova , and prior to that on the ability of the progenitor star to ionize the halo and drive out gas in its inner region . even in the case that a hii regions was created , a too small injection energy or a too high halo mass would cause the expansion of the supernova bubble to stall and the gas to start to fall back towards the center . in case",
    "the supernova is able to disrupt the halo , however , material from the center of the halo is ejected and transported to distances of the order of kpc .",
    "so far , in these simulations the effect on magnetic fields was not studied .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite considered the effect of a single supernova on a magnetized medium with homogeneous density in the present day interstellar medium on scales of @xmath14 100 pc thus significantly smaller than the scale of interest here .",
    "the authors show that the magnetic field is swept up in the supernova shell , which can also be expected for primordial halos affected by supernovae .",
    "how exactly the magnetic field on large ( kpc ) scales is affected in a primordial halo will be the main focus of the work presented here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : techniques ] we describe the numerical techniques used for the simulations . in section  [ sec : ic ] we describe the initial conditions used for the simulated primordial halos .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , where we first give a general overview of the simulations before we consider the properties of the magnetic field and the effect of varying conditions .",
    "next , the results are discussed in a broader context in section  [ sec : discussion ] before we summarize our work in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the simulations were preformed with the versatile astrophysical code flash in version 4  @xcite .",
    "we use the unsplit , staggered mesh solver , which comes along with the public flash version 4 @xcite , in order to solve the magnetohydrodynamical equations under the condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the solver implicitly satisfies the divergence - free constraint of the magnetic field up to the accuracy of machine round - off errors .",
    "we used a third order hydro scheme and a hybrid riemann solver using the hll scheme at shocks and the hlld scheme otherwise in order to guarantee the best stability and accuracy . in all simulations the adiabatic index",
    "is set to @xmath15 .",
    "we do not use self - gravity in this work in order to speed up the simulations .",
    "we instead model the gravitational effect of baryonic and dark matter by assuming a spherically symmetric gravitational potential which remains constant over time . despite the fact that the ( baryonic ) density distribution changes over time we consider it as a reasonable approximation for two reasons : firstly , on the timescales considered the dark matter distribution is not expected to change significantly .",
    "secondly , at the scales of interest ( @xmath16 10 pc  1 kpc ) the gravitational potential is dominated by the dark matter which is why the change in the baryonic matter distribution would only have a minor effect on the overall gravitational potential .",
    "we point out that for a mean dark matter density in the halos of @xmath17 ( see equation  [ eq : mdm2 ] further below ) the free - fall time is about 30 myr thus significantly longer than the timescales considered here ( @xmath14 10 myr ) , which also justifies the use of a fixed gravitational potential .",
    "we emphasize that a time - independent gravitational potential was also used by a number of other authors @xcite despite the fact that moderate changes in the dark matter profile could be introduced by supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "we performed two kinds of simulations , simulations with an adiabatic behaviour ( @xmath15 ) , where no additional cooling is applied , and simulations using a tabulated cooling function appropriate for primordial gas with zero metallicity as a sink of thermal energy after the hydrodynamical timestep .",
    "for the latter simulations we use the cooling rates @xmath18 given by @xcite .",
    "these include collisional excitation and ionization cooling for h and he , recombination cooling for h and he , and bremsstrahlung .",
    "we note that we are missing an accurate description for compton cooling for a redshift of z = 20 , which is why we most likely somewhat underestimate the cooling efficiency ( see also section  [ sec : caveats ] ) . after each hydrodynamical timestep",
    "we update the internal energy by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hydrogen number density and d@xmath21 the hydro timestep . by using a subcycling scheme for the cooling routine",
    "we guarantee that the internal energy does not change by more than 20% within one cooling timestep . in case",
    "more that one cooling timestep is required ( since the internal energy would change by more than 20% otherwise ) the cooling rate @xmath18 , which depends on the temperature of the gas , is updated accordingly .",
    "we now describe the initial conditions used in our simulations .",
    "we performed simulations with different masses of the dark matter halo , varying magnetic field strengths , and two different scaling relations between the magnetic field and the gas density .",
    "moreover , we simulated the effect of supernova explosions with different amounts of energy . finally , as mentioned already before we repeated some selected simulations without cooling , i.e. with a purely adiabatic behaviour in order to investigate the effect of the cooling . all simulations and their corresponding parameters are listed in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "the simulations where performed in a cubic box with a side length of 1024 pc using a uniform resolution of 512@xmath22 grid points , i.e. a spatial resolution of 2 pc . in order to cover a larger physical scale we have repeated one of the simulations ( m3_b1_pisn ) with a two times larger simulation box , i.e. a cube with a side length of 2048 pc .",
    "the inner region , a cube with a side length of 1024 pc , has the same spatial resolution of 2 pc as in the original run whereas in the outer parts we have a two times lower resolution of 4 pc .",
    "hence , the grid structure is that of a nested grid with a 512@xmath22 grid placed in the center of second 512@xmath22 grid with a two times lower resolution .",
    "we point out that we used highly idealized simulations described in the following to probe the influence of supernovae on the magnetic field evolution .",
    "this idealization was necessary in order to be able to cover the aforementioned parameter space with a reasonable number of simulations and to be able to use the high resolution required for a proper analysis of the magnetic field while simultaneously keeping the computational costs at a reasonable level .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      next , we investigate the effect of the halo mass . since we have seen in section  [ sec : bvary ] that changing the magnetic field strength over a wide range does not significantly alter the results , we concentrate on a single value for the magnetic field . in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mvary ] we plot the spectra of the runs m1_b1_sn , m1_b1_pisn , m2_b1_sn , m2_b1_pisn , and m3_b1_pisn at the end of each simulation .",
    "we point out that for run m3_b1_sn showing recollapse the spectrum as well as the autocorrelation function are not shown .        for the runs m1_b1_sn , m1_b1_pisn , m2_b1_pisn , and m3_b1_pisn , where the remnant is able to disrupt the halo and escape from the gravitational potential well , the spectra peak at low @xmath5-values of the order of 5  10 in agreement with the results of the previous sections . for run",
    "m2_b1_sn is less clear . here",
    "the supernova remnant has already started to recollapse in the central regions , whereas in the outer regions the remnant keeps expanding even after 10 myr .",
    "hence , we see a bimodal spectrum with one peak coming from the ongoing expansion and the peak at small scales from the beginning recollapse .",
    "the autocorrelation functions for the runs m1_b1_sn , m1_b1_pisn , m2_b1_sn , m2_b1_pisn , and m3_b1_pisn are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mvary ] .",
    "for the all runs except run m2_b1_sn the correlation length increases by a factor @xmath16 10 reaching values of the order of 100  200 pc .",
    "however , it can be seen that for the runs with the lower halo masses the correlation seems to be less strong on larger scales compared to run m3_b1_pisn ( black line ) as indicated by the steeper decline in @xmath23 .",
    "this nicely agrees with the finding that the spectrum of run m3_b1_pisn is the one with the most magnetic energy on large scales , i.e. that it peaks at the smallest @xmath5-value ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mvary ] ) . for run m2_b1_sn ( violet line )",
    "the decline is even stronger in agreement with the double - peaked spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the cooling ability of primordial gas can be significantly reduced in regions close to a source emitting large amounts of ionizing radiation .",
    "for this reason , we have simulated an extreme case in which the cooling is completely turned off , i.e. the gas behaves purely adiabatic .",
    "we first point out that in run m2_b1_sn_ad and m3_b1_sn_ad the core collapse supernova manages to disrupt the halo in contrast to the runs m2_b1_sn and m3_b1_sn with cooling .",
    "this can be understood on the basis of a simple energy argument : the gravitational binding energies of the baryonic gas for the runs with a total halo mass of @xmath24 and @xmath25 m@xmath4 are @xmath26 and @xmath27 erg , respectively .",
    "since both values are smaller than the explosion energy of the supernova ( e@xmath28 erg ) and since no energy is lost by cooling processes , the supernova can disrupt the halo .",
    "we now show the magnetic field spectra for the runs m2_b1_sn_ad , m3_b1_sn_ad , m3_b1_pisn_ad , and m3_b4_pisn_ad at the end of each run in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] .    .",
    "]    the autocorrelation function for those runs ( not shown here ) agree well with the results of the spectrum analysis .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] , the spectra of the runs without cooling in general peak a somewhat higher @xmath5-values than the corresponding runs with cooling .",
    "the higher value of k@xmath29 is similar to the findings in the runs with a low halo mass ( the runs m1_b1_sn , m1_b1_pisn , and m2_b1_pisn ) as well to the findings of run m3_b1_5pisn , which all peak at somewhat smaller @xmath5-values than run m3_b1_pisn .",
    "we attribute this behaviour to the same physical origin : for the lower - mass halos the cooling ability of the gas is reduced due to the overall lower densities ( see equation  [ eq : cooling ] ) and the gas requires a longer time to cool .",
    "similarly , for run m3_b1_5pisn a longer cooling time is required due to the higher explosion energy . in consequence",
    ", in both cases the cooling time scale is prolonged when compared to the typical expansion timescale of the supernova .",
    "for this reason , the evolution of the gas is more similar to an adiabatic evolution like in the runs in which cooling is turned off completely .",
    "hence , for these runs as well as the runs without cooling a rather thick shell develops in contrast to the thin shock fronts seen in the other runs .",
    "this is demonstrated exemplarily for run m3_b1_pisn_ad in fig .",
    "[ fig : nocool ] where the density and magnetic energy at a slice through the center are shown .",
    "the high - density region behind the shock front is much thicker than for the case with cooling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : slicessn53 ] ) and contains significant , small - scale magnetic field fluctuations not observed in run m3_b1_pisn .",
    "these small - scale fluctuations cause the spectra to peak at a higher values of k. similar results are also found for the runs m1_b1_sn , m1_b1_pisn , m2_b1_pisn , and m3_b1_5pisn , hence for all the runs in which the cooling time is increased relative to dynamical timescale .",
    "we consider the final fate of the supernova remnant in dependence of the halo mass and the injection energy and compare the results with those from other numerical studies . to remind the reader we find that a core collapse supernova ( @xmath30 erg ) can not disperse halos as massive as @xmath31 m@xmath4 or above .",
    "also for the halo with @xmath24 m@xmath4 ( run m2_b1_sn ) we see signs of recollapse in the central region although the outer regions keep expanding . hence , this mass seems to be roughly the borderline between expansion and recollapse .",
    "we note , however , that we would have to include a more detailed treatment of the thermodynamics as well as radiation transfer in order to make a definite statement about the final state of the supernova remnant . in general , however , our findings are in agreement with recent works of  @xcite and  @xcite modelling the evolution of a core collapse supernova in a halo of @xmath16 10@xmath2 m@xmath4 .",
    "two further parameter studies on the final fate of primordial supernova without magnetic fields were performed by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we combine our results with the results of these authors in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] showing the final fate of the supernova in dependence of the halo mass and the explosion energy .        as can be seen",
    ", our results agree reasonably well with the results of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the different results suggest that supernovae with an explosion energy of @xmath32 erg are able to disrupt halos with masses up to @xmath16 @xmath33 m@xmath4 . for pisn",
    ", our results agree with that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the apparent contradiction between the result of @xcite and @xcite might be due to the fact that the latter authors initialized their explosions with purely thermal energy , which might be radiated away too quickly @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the explosion energy should rather be inserted as kinetic energy as it was done in this work .",
    "hence , this would imply a mass limit of the of about @xmath34 m@xmath4 , up to which halos can be dispersed by a pisn .",
    "our findings that the core collapse supernova is not able to disrupt the halo with a mass of @xmath25 m@xmath4  despite the explosion energy being somewhat larger than the gravitational binding energy of the baryons ( see section  [ sec : nocool ] )  agrees with the findings of @xcite : for massive halos explosion energies significantly larger than the gravitational binding energy are required to disrupt the halo .",
    "this is due to the efficient radiative cooling at high densities removing energy before it can contribute to the disruption of the halo .",
    "overall , we find that  despite the strong simplifications made to model our initial conditions and the highly idealized treatment of the thermodynamical gas properties  our results concerning the final fate of the halo are in reasonable agreement with simulations including a much more sophisticated treatment of the physical processes involved @xcite",
    ".      from the magnetic field spectra discussed before we can infer the time evolution of the coherence length @xmath35 of the magnetic field over time . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we define the coherence length as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ( dimensionless ) @xmath5-value of the peak of the spectra from our simulations . since the expansion of the supernova remnant is not linear in time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rshell ] ) and since we are more interested in how the coherence length relates to the radius of the supernova shell @xmath38 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lb ] we plot @xmath35 against the @xmath38 for several selected simulations",
    ".     of the magnetic field plotted against the radius of the supernova shell for the runs m1_b1_sn , m1_b1_pisn , m3_b1_pisn , m3_b1_5pisn , and m3_b4_pisn .",
    "for all cases the coherence length reveals an approximately linear scaling with @xmath38 . to guide the readers eye",
    ", we show a linear relation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( black lines ) . ]",
    "as can be seen , the coherence length @xmath35 keeps on increasing with increasing shell radius for all cases considered .",
    "the two black lines show an assumed linear scaling of the coherence length @xmath35 as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it can be seen that the coherence length of the magnetic field inside a supernova bubble reaches values of the order of 100  300 pc ( see also table  [ tab : results ] ) and thus of the order of 20%  50% of the radius of the shell .",
    "for late times in run m3_b1_pisn the coherence length even reaches values of up to @xmath16 60% of the shell radius .",
    "we note that in order to improve the readability of the plot we do not show the results of the runs m3_b2_pisn and m3_b3_pisn , in particular since qualitatively they do not differ too much from run m3_b1_pisn .",
    "@xcite simulate the evolution of a pisn from redshift 20 to 12 , i.e. over 200 myr until the shock front stalls . by this time",
    "the shock front has reached a distance of about 2.5  3 kpc from the progenitor star .",
    "hence , under the assumption that the approximately linear relation between the coherence length of the magnetic field and the supernova shell radius found in our work holds over the _ entire _ evolution of the remnant , this results in ordered magnetic fields on scales as large as @xmath16 1.5 kpc .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in the sections  [ sec : spectra ] and  [ sec : bvary ] , the amount of magnetic energy on large scales remains approximately constant or even increase over time at the cost of the small - scale fluctuations .",
    "hence , for a region affected by a supernova one could expect a significant magnetic field to be present on large scales even at late times .",
    "depending on the efficiency of the small - scale dynamo during the lifecycle of the pop iii stars , we find a large - scale ( @xmath43 100 pc ) magnetic field component with a strength of up to 10@xmath44 g , at least for an initially saturated field .",
    "such a large - scale magnetic field as discussed before could have a significant effect on the possible recollapse of the bubble interior , on the ensuing potential formation of supermassive black holes @xcite , and on the overall fragmentation properties of the gas and the ability to form protostellar disks @xcite .",
    "the latter authors showed that for primordial minihalos with a well - ordered magnetic field and a mass - to - flux ratio @xcite below @xmath45 fragmentation is largely reduced . in order to make some predictions about the expected fragmentation properties during a potential second collapse in our case , we approximate the mass - to - flux - ratio by @xmath46 with the critical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath47 and the gravitational constant g @xcite , the coherence length @xmath35 of the magnetic field ranging from 100  500 pc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lb ] ) , @xmath48  g  @xmath49 ( see bottom left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : slicessn53 ] ) , and the field strength @xmath50 from @xmath51 g  @xmath52 g ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) . with these values",
    "we obtain mass - to - flux ratios in the range of 0.02  1500 . hence , under the reasonable assumption that during a subsequent recollapse the mass - to - flux ratio is more or less preserved and based on the results of @xcite , we would expect a relatively low degree of fragmentation in such a minihalo undergoing a second round of star formation .",
    "as shown here , in regions with a high halo density the occurrence of several supernovae might lead to the generation of a volume filling , relatively well - ordered magnetic field of significant strength .",
    "in particular , the bottom - up formation of the first galaxies is believed to occur in regions with a significantly higher halo density than predicted under the assumption of a homogeneous distribution .",
    "@xcite find a mean separation between potentially star forming halos of the order of @xmath53 kpc .",
    "since this separation is of the order of or even somewhat smaller than the typical coherence length of the magnetic field inferred in this work ( @xmath54 kpc ) , one could indeed expect a volume filling , large - scale magnetic field in regions where the first galaxies have formed .    as shown by  @xcite , only stars with masses between @xmath16 10 ",
    "50 m@xmath4 and between 140  260 m@xmath4 will end their lives with a core collapse supernova or a pisn , respectively . in this context",
    ", we point out that despite the expected fragmentation in primordial halos and the formation some low - mass pop iii stars @xcite , recent simulations have shown that star - forming halos should host pop iii stars with typical masses ranging from 10 m@xmath4 up to about 50 m@xmath4 limited by radiative feedback @xcite but also a good fraction with masses in excess of 100 m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "hence , one can expect that masses of pop iii stars indeed lie in the range suitable for a core collapse supernova or a pisn and that each star forming halo is affected by one or more supernovae .",
    "moreover , around a redshift @xmath55 the press - schechter formalism  @xcite predicts only few halos to have virial masses significantly above @xmath33 m@xmath4 .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that  despite the fact that a core collapse supernova can only disrupt halos up to a few 10@xmath2 m@xmath4 as discussed in section  [ sec : disruption ]  most of the times a halo is forming pop iii stars , it will be disrupted by a subsequent supernova resulting in the build - up of a large - scale magnetic field .",
    "hence , the volume affected by supernovae during the assembly of first galaxies seems to depend crucially on the exact number of star forming halos . @xcite and @xcite simulating the formation of a first galaxy including stellar feedback",
    "find that of the order of 10 halos form pop iii stars prior to the formation of the galaxy .",
    "the simulations presented here thus suggest that a significant fraction of the volume of a region forming a protogalaxy might indeed be pervaded by a large - scale magnetic field of considerable strength .",
    "such a magnetic field configuration would possibly also affect the formation of the first galaxies and in particular their early evolution : it is usually assumed that the initial magnetic field in protogalaxies is rather small - scaled .",
    "subsequently , a kpc - scale magnetic field of considerable strength builds up within about 10@xmath56 yr or less due to the small - scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "this field serves as a seed for the mean - field dynamo responsible for the large - scale , well - ordered magnetic field observed in present day galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , a large - scale magnetic field from the very beginning as suggested here could possibly allow the mean - field dynamo to act at an even earlier phase thus potentially affecting the later evolution of the galaxy .",
    "finally , we note that the emergence of highly energetic pair instability supernovae in lower - mass halos could also contribute to the magnetization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "@xcite showed that supernova - driven winds in dwarf galaxies can magnetize the igm by a substantial degree starting around z = 10 .",
    "we tentatively suggest that  depending on the frequencies of pair instabilities supernovae in primordial halos  the magnetization of the igm could have started already around z = 20 . a magnetization on kpc scale with field strengths of 10@xmath57  10@xmath44  g found in this work ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) would be in good agreement with recent faraday rotation measurements of @xcite as well as with fermi observations , revealing lower bounds of the magnetic field on kpc scales of the order of @xmath58 g ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 2 . ) .",
    "we emphasize that in order to properly analyse the properties of the magnetic field  the main focus of this work  we had to use a high and homogeneous spatial resolution of 512@xmath22 grid points in our simulations . on the other hand , simulations making use of the adaptive mesh refinement algorithm and refining e.g. for the gas density ,",
    "usually reveal a well resolved region in the center of the halo but rather poorly resolved outer parts .",
    "such a grid structure , however , would be highly disadvantageous for analysing the magnetic field structure by means of a fourier transformation as done in section  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "moreover , due to the large number of runs required to explore the parameter space  consisting of the halo mass , the magnetic field strength and the explosion energy  a fully self - consistent treatment of all relevant physical processes like self gravity , chemistry , cooling and radiation transport is currently not possible .",
    "for this reason we have not applied self gravity in the simulations but used a time - independent gravitational potential .",
    "furthermore , we modelled the thermodynamical behaviour of the gas by means of a tabulated cooling curve  @xcite making use of a subcycling scheme for updating the thermal energy .",
    "it was argued that such a subcycling scheme might be too inaccurate and that the global minimum of the courant timestep and the cooling timestep should rather be used to update the hydrodynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ? * in particular their section 2.4 ) .",
    "however , since we are mainly interested in how the supernova globally reorganises the magnetic field structure , for our purposes we consider our approach as sufficient .",
    "we furthermore note that due to the lack of the compton cooling process in our cooling routine , we somewhat underestimate the real cooling efficiency .",
    "this , in turn , probably causes the final radii of our remnants ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lb ] ) to be somewhat too large .",
    "however , since our results concerning the radial expansion agree reasonably well with that of more sophisticated simulations ( see , e.g. fig . 7 of * ? ? ?",

    ". finally , we note that the cooling efficiency in our work as well as the works mentioned before might generally be too low since cosmic ray acceleration and subsequent emission due to second order fermi processes in the shock front have not been considered @xcite .",
    "this effect could again result in somewhat smaller final radii of the supernova remnants .",
    "we suppose that a more sophisticated inclusion of all effects mentioned before would cause at least 10  most likely even more  times higher computational costs . however , since we made a great effort to generate proper initial conditions in particular for the magnetic field and since we find a good agreement with more sophisticated simulations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider our simplified approach as justified .",
    "we note that setting the initial density in the supernova remnant and the hii region to a constant value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ic ] ) , is a rather crude approximation .",
    "however , we would like to point out that due to the lack of spatial resolution we were not able to self - consistently model the earliest evolutionary phase of the supernova .",
    "moreover , at later times density and velocity profiles in our simulations are in rough agreement with other simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , and since we are mainly interested in the late stages of the supernova evolution , we consider the approximations made in our initial setup as sufficient . however , as shown by @xcite , a reverse shock , occurring once the supernova shock front hits the edge of the hii region , might trap a fraction of the magnetic energy in the center thus possibly reducing the strength of the large - scale magnetic field , a process we are clearly lacking in our setup . hence , in combination with the possible overestimation of the final size of the remnants ( due to a simplified cooling description as discussed above ) we suggest that the values concerning the coherence length and strength of the large - scale magnetic field given in this work ( table  [ tab : results ] ) should rather be considered as upper limits .",
    "the simulations presented here can also serve as a valuable guide for future and more sophisticated simulations including a better treatment of processes like gravity , chemistry , and/or radiation transfer .",
    "in particular , it is planned to repeat some of the selected simulations with self gravity and a proper treatment of the chemistry making use of a new primordial chemistry module implemented in flash  @xcite . by doing",
    "so we can test to what extent the magnetic field properties depend on the proper treatment of these processes .",

    "we have presented simulations of core collapse supernovae and pair instability supernovae going off in the center of magnetized dark matter halos .",
    "we have varied the degree of magnetization as well as the halo mass ( @xmath59  @xmath60 m@xmath4 ) in order to infer systematical effects on the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "the simulations were performed using a tabulated cooling function in order to model the thermodynamical behaviour of the gas . despite the simplified physical treatment ,",
    "our simulations agree well with results from other authors and thus serve as a useful guide for more realistic simulations .",
    "our simulations suggest that supernovae with a total explosion energy of 10@xmath0/10@xmath1 erg are not able to disrupt halos more massive than 10@xmath2 m@xmath4/10@xmath3 m@xmath4 in agreement with other studies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the supernova manages to disrupt the halo , a thin shock layer develops separating the post - shock from the pre - shock material .",
    "the initially small - scale , strongly disordered magnetic field is transported with the expanding gas resulting in a significant increase in the coherence length of the gas .",
    "the magnetic field spectra show a shift of the peak down to @xmath5-values of about 4 at the end of the simulations corresponding to a length scale of up to 250 pc .",
    "the typical correlation length of the magnetic field determined from autocorrelation functions at the end of the simulations is of the order of 150  200 pc in good agreement with the magnetic field spectra .",
    "we note that the maximum reachable coherence length in this work was limited by the size of the simulation domain . for gas with a reduced cooling efficiency a thicker post - shock region builds up and the spectra peak at larger @xmath5-values .",
    "in general we find that for halos being disrupted by a supernova the large - scale component of the magnetic field has a strength ranging from about @xmath61 g to @xmath62 g strongly depending on the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "moreover , the coherence length @xmath35 of the magnetic field scales approximately linear with the extension of the supernova bubble being about 20%  50% of the supernova shell radius .",
    "extrapolating this relation for later times we find that for a typical pisn reaching an extension of up to 3 kpc @xcite well - ordered magnetic fields with coherence lengths of up to 1.5 kpc can be expected .",
    "we note that due to the simplified treatment of the gas cooling and the initial modelling of the hii region and supernova blast wave , the above values should rather be considered as upper limits .",
    "we discussed a number of implications of our findings for several subsequent processes .",
    "we suggest that magnetic fields with this strength and coherence length can have significant implications for a subsequent recollapse of the halo in particular by suppressing fragmentation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such fields could potentially affect regions of a high halo density where several star forming halos with supernova explosions are expected , e.g. in the regions where the first galaxies are believed to form .",
    "our simulations suggest that these regions might have a significant large - scale magnetic field component from the very beginning",
    ". this could affect the formation of first galaxies and the onset of the mean - field dynamo responsible for the large - scale magnetic field observed in galaxies nowadays .",
