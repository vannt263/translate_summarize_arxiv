    "the most fundamental , yet the least well known , parameter of the agn central engine is its mass .",
    "while the agn luminosity , which is readily measurable , varies over six orders of magnitude , the ratio @xmath1 ( or , alternatively , the ratio , @xmath2 ) apparently has a rather small range , indicating that the @xmath1 value is a property characterizing the agn phenomenon . in terms of the ratio we find from various mass estimation methods and for various agn samples @xmath3  0.0011 .",
    "this value and its spread depend on the method used to estimate the mass .",
    "the methods used to determine the central mass in agn can be divided into three major groups : blr kinematics , x - ray variability and spectral fitting .",
    "the first group uses the broad emission lines as probes , assuming the velocity dispersion of the line - emitting gas is induced by the gravitational potential of the central mass .",
    "the second gives the variability mass limit ( eq . [ equ : mdt ] ) , while the third is a variant of the temperature mass ( eq . [ equ : mt ] ) , essentially trying to fit the uv bump with a spectrum from a thin model . in the following sections i will describe the three groups and the problems associated with each of them",
    "any compact , accretion - powered radiation source can be assigned several fiducial mass estimates :    \\1 . the limit . in order to maintain steady spherical accretion the luminosity must be less than the luminosity , @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 , or @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the variability limit .",
    "the shortest time scale for global variations in the luminosity is the light travel time across the schwarzschild radius , @xmath9  s. hence if the luminosity is observed to vary significantly on a time scale @xmath10 , the mass has to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective radius of emission in units of @xmath13 .",
    "\\3 . the temperature mass .",
    "if a luminosity @xmath14 comes from an region of radius @xmath15 and temperature @xmath16 , then @xmath17 .",
    "if a spectral feature at frequency @xmath18 is due to emission from a at a characteristic radius @xmath15 , then the temperature is given by @xmath19 , and we have an upper limit on the mass : @xmath20    \\4 .",
    "the evolutionary mass .",
    "this mass involves the evolution of a massive due to accretion .",
    "we may define the time @xmath21 as the time required for an accretion - powered object radiating at the luminosity to double its mass , @xmath22 the observed luminosity implies an accretion rate of @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the efficiency . combining these two expressions gives the evolutionary mass , accumulated if the accretion rate is maintained during a time @xmath21 : @xmath25 where the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the luminosity ratio and the fraction of the active time for intermittently active agn .",
    "the broad emission lines characteristic of quasar and seyfert  1 spectra are believed to originate from gas highly ionized by the continuum radiation of the central source .",
    "the line width must be due to bulk motions , probably an ensemble of clouds moving in the gravitational potential of the central .",
    "alternative scenarios include radiative acceleration ( e.g. blumenthal and mathews 1975 ) , which would induce radial outflow . however , radial motions are probably excluded because they would induce asymmetric line profiles ( if the emitting clouds are optically thick ) which are usually not observed .",
    "most workers today agree that the line width in agn is induced by keplerian bulk motions .",
    "if this is the case , knowledge of the distance of the line - emitting gas from the central mass would allow us to estimate the mass , @xmath28 the kinematic mass - estimation methods can be divided into two sub - groups , depending on the method used to find the distance : photoionization methods and reverberation mapping .",
    "we assume that the spatial extent of the blr may be represented by a characteristic size  e.g. the radius at which the emission peaks .",
    "indeed , reverberation analyses have shown that the time lag of emission - line variability varies depending on the line , and the emission region may be extended in radius .",
    "however , photo - ionization calculations have shown that the line emissivities of many lines peak sharply in a relatively narrow range of density and ionization parameter ( baldwin et  al .",
    "depending on the radial variation of the density this may imply that the emission of a given line is localized in a relatively narrow shell around the continuum source . given these results ,",
    "the single radius model may be a reasonable approximation for a particular emission line .",
    "the physical conditions in the line - emitting gas are largely determined by the ionization parameter ( the ratio of ionizing photon density to the electron density , @xmath29 , e.g. netzer 1990 ) @xmath30 where the ionizing photon flux ( number of ionizing photons per unit time ) is @xmath31 @xmath32 is the luminosity per unit energy , and @xmath33 is the ionization potential of the line under consideration ( 1 rydberg=13.6  ev for the hydrogen lines ) . defining the ionizing luminosity , @xmath34 and the mean energy of an ionizing photon , @xmath35",

    "[ equ : rion ] .",
    "the ionizing flux is dominated by the euv continuum in the 110 rydberg regime , where most of the ionizing photons are emitted . since the continuum in this range",
    "can not be observed directly , it may be estimated by extrapolation from the nearest observable energy bands : the uv and soft x - rays .",
    "the far uv spectrum has been observed beyond the lyman limit for about 100 quasars to wavelengths of 600    ( zheng et  al .",
    "wandel ( 1997 ) uses an estimate of the ionizing flux based on the soft x - ray continuum spectrum .",
    "this approach is particularly appropriate for lines with high ionization potentials such as c  iv and o  vi , which are derived from more energetic photons , thus closer to the soft x - ray band .      a different approach that does not require the thin shell assumption tries to estimate the size of the emitting volume .",
    "assuming this volume to be roughly spherical , the line luminosity would be ( dibai 1981 ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the line volume emissivity and @xmath54 is the volume filling factor .",
    "dibai ( 1981 ) took @xmath55 which is arbitrary and probably an overestimate .",
    "wandel & yahil ( 1985 ) elaborated the method by expressing @xmath54 in terms of the better known @xmath56 , the angular covering factor : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the column density of the line emitting gas . substituting this into equation [ equ : lvol ] gives ( for the h@xmath59 line )",

    "a similar value may be obtained from the sample of joly et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) .",
    "although in part this correlation is expected , because of the known strong correlation between the line and continuum luminosities , the correlation found is actually steeper and stronger than the expected one . if true , this correlation may imply a universal mass - luminosity relation , which , in terms of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath64  erg  s@xmath5 ) , can be expressed as @xmath65 .",
    "similar methods can be applied to the narrow emission - line region ( nlr ) , provided the gas there is gravitationally bound .",
    "typical parameter values for the nlr are @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( e.g. brotherton et  al . 1994 ) .",
    "of course , within the distance of the nlr from the center , the stellar mass of the host galaxy could be comparable to the mass of the central black hole , but they may be correlated ( see laor 1998 ) .",
    "wandel & mushotzky ( 1986 ) find an excellent correlation between the mass estimated from the narrow - line width and the mass estimated from x - ray variability ( fig .  3 in section 4 below ) .",
    "wandel & mushotzky ( 1986 ) also apply this method to a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies finding that seyfert  2s as a group obey the same correlation , provided we observe only a fraction ( 0.1 ) of the emitted x - ray continuum .",
    "this is consistent with presence of an obscuring torus , as suggested by the unified scheme of agn .",
    "variability in the continuum uv luminosity is observed to be followed by corresponding changes in the line luminosity with delays ranging from days in low - luminosity agn to months in luminous quasars .",
    "cross - correlating the continuum and light curves gives the peak of the power in the delay and the characteristic size ( @xmath68 ) of the region . using this size in eq .",

    "so do of course the inferred masses .      although giving a more direct measurement of the blr size than the photo - ionization methods , the reverberation mapping kinematic method has two drawbacks :    * very few agn ( about a dozen ) have reliable reverberation data . measuring the reverberation radius requires many observations and is a large project .",
