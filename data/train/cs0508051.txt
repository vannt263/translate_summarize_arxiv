    "intersymbol - interference ( isi ) channels are encountered in a wide range of communication systems , such as high - data - rate mobile radio systems ( especially in hilly terrain ) , wireline systems , or aeronautical/ satellite communication systems . for mobile radio applications ,",
    "fading channels are of particular interest . the equivalent discrete - time channel impulse response ( cir ) of a sparse isi channel has a large channel memory length @xmath2 , but only a small number of significant channel coefficients .    due to the large memory length , equalization of sparse isi channels is a demanding task .",
    "the topics of linear equalization and decision - feedback equalization for sparse isi channels are , e.g. , addressed in @xcite , where the sparse structure of the channel is explicitly utilized for the design of the corresponding finite - impulse - response ( fir ) filter(s ) .",
    "trellis - based equalization for sparse channels is addressed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the complexity in terms of trellis states of an optimal trellis - based equalizer , based on the viterbi algorithm ( va )  @xcite or the bahl - cocke - jelinek - raviv algorithm ( bcjra )  @xcite , is normally prohibitive for sparse isi channels , because it grows exponentially with the channel memory length @xmath2 .",
    "however , reduced - complexity algorithms can be derived by exploiting the sparseness of the channel .    in @xcite , it is observed that given a sparse channel , there is only a comparably small number of possible branch metrics within each trellis segment . by avoiding to compute the same branch metric several times ,",
    "the computational complexity is reduced significantly without loss of optimality .",
    "however , the complexity in terms of trellis states remains the same and thus the storage expense . as an alternative , another equalizer concept coined _ multi - trellis viterbi algorithm ( @xmath0 ) _ is proposed in @xcite that is based on multiple parallel _ irregular _ trellises ( i.e. , time - variant trellises ) .",
    "the @xmath0 is claimed to have a significantly reduced computational complexity and storage expense without ( much ) loss of optimality .",
    "a particularly simple solution to reduce the complexity of the conventional va without loss of optimality can be found in  @xcite : the _ parallel - trellis viterbi algorithm ( @xmath1 ) _ is based on multiple parallel _",

    "however , an application of the @xmath1 is only possible for a certain class of sparse channels having a so - called _ zero - pad structure_. in order to tackle more general sparse channels with a cir close to a zero - pad channel , it is proposed in @xcite to exchange tentative decisions between the parallel trellises and thus cancel residual isi .",

    "the preceding section has shown that trellis - based equalization of a general sparse isi channel is quite a demanding task : an application of the optimal @xmath1 ( or the @xmath78 ) is only possible for zero - pad channels . in the case of a more general sparse channel , the suboptimal @xmath4 with residual isi cancellation",
    "can be used . however , for a good performance the cir should at least be close to a zero - pad structure @xcite .",

    "the @xmath91-transform @xmath98 of the filtered cir @xmath80 is obtained as follows : those zeros of @xmath90 that are inside or on the unit circle are retained for @xmath98 , whereas the outside zeros are reflected into the unit circle .",
    "the resulting minimum - phase cir is @xmath99^{\\rm t}$ ] , which is not sparse anymore .    as opposed to this , in the special case of a zero - pad channel the sparse structure",

    ", these zeros are reflected into the unit circle , i.e. , the corresponding zeros of @xmath113 are given by @xmath114 .",

    "<S> the complexity of maximum - likelihood detection , e.g. , by means of the viterbi algorithm ( va ) , is normally prohibitive . in the first part of the paper , a unified framework based on factor graphs </S>",
    "<S> is presented for complexity reduction without loss of optimality . in this new context </S>",
    "<S> , two known reduced - complexity algorithms for sparse isi channels are recapitulated : the multi - trellis va ( @xmath0 ) and the parallel - trellis va ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the @xmath0 , although claimed , does not lead to a reduced computational complexity . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 , on the other hand , leads to a significant complexity reduction , but can only be applied for a certain class of sparse channels . in the second part of the paper , a unified approach is investigated to tackle general sparse channels : it is shown that the use of a linear filter at the receiver renders the application of standard reduced - state trellis - based equalizer algorithms feasible , without significant loss of optimality . </S>",
