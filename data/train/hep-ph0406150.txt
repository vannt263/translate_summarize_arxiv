    "a very common process to study is the collision between an electron and a proton .",
    "this process is usually deeply inelastic at high energies , which is due to the fact that the proton is not an elementary particle but is instead made up of even smaller particles , the quarks .",
    "this was observed in 1968 , and it was found that the proton consist of three quarks , two up - quarks and one down - quark . however , the picture is not as simple as that . since the quarks interact via the strong force which is mediated by the gluons , there are also a lot of gluons in the proton",
    ". these gluons can create quark - antiquark pairs or split into new gluons , and thus the proton structure is much more complicated .",
    "it was indeed observed in these collisions that almost half of the proton s momentum is carried by particles that do nt interact electromagnetically , namely the gluons .",
    "gluons and quarks are collectively called partons .",
    "let us consider a typical electron - proton scattering event , see figure 1 .",
    "we have an incoming electron with four - momentum @xmath2 and an incoming proton with four - momentum @xmath3 interacting via the exchange of a virtual photon with virtuality @xmath4 .",

    "the simplest possible process is that it stays on the mass - shell after the absorption , with a momentum @xmath7 .",
    "we define the variable @xmath8 , as the fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the parton , which is struck by the virtual photon ; thus @xmath9 .",
    "since the mass of the proton , and naturally its partons , can be neglected at the energy scales we are concerned about , we get @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and hence @xmath12 .",
    "this variable @xmath8 is called the bjorken scaling variable , usually denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we define , the parton distribution function @xmath14 , as the probability for finding a parton carrying a momentum fraction @xmath8 of the proton .",
    "usually we use subscripts to denote which parton we are considering , for example with @xmath15 we denote the probability for finding a quark with momentum fraction @xmath8 . to specify the flavor of the quark we use the subscripts u , d etc .",
    "the parton model predicts that these distribution functions depend only on the variable @xmath8 .",
    "this behavior is known as scaling , which is also why @xmath8 is called the bjorken scaling variable . if a parton has a certain @xmath8 it could either have this momentum fraction from the beginning , or it could initially have a larger momentum fraction and reduce it to @xmath8 through emission of gluons .",
    "the avaliable phase space for radiating gluons is larger when @xmath16 is large .",
    "therefore the distribution functions will show a greater probability to have smaller @xmath8 , and smaller probability for carrying large @xmath8 for larger @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that the distribution functions are not only functions of @xmath8 , but they are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this is a central feature of qcd , and it is called scaling violation . it is possible to derive evolution equations for the distribution functions in the variable @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is often used instead ) if one considers the various processes in the proton , such as quarks radiating gluons or gluons splitting into gluons or quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "thus , if one knows the distribution function for a certain value of @xmath18 , the value for any other @xmath18 can be calculated using these equations , which in the case of qcd are known as the _ altarelli - parisi equations_. these equations can be found in any book on quantum field theory .",
    "the distribution functions are important because the cross sections for different events ( both in qed and qcd ) can be expressed in these function .",
    "thus , for the process we considered above , an electron hitting a proton , the cross section can be written as @xmath20 \\label{eq : e1}\\ ] ] here the cross sections in the integrand are the cross sections for the sub - collisions between the electron and the partons , and the sum runs over the quark and the antiquark flavors .    from now on we will use capital letters to denote the densities in the variable ln@xmath21 , @xmath22 for fermions and @xmath23 for gluons .        consider now the emission of many gluons before the parton is hit by the photon .",

    "the probability , in the leading log approximation , to emit a gluon is given by @xmath39    this factor must however be modified because the ordering in   implies that no gluon is emitted with @xmath40 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus we must also take into account the probability that no emission has occurred between these two values .",

    "with respect to ln@xmath16 we obtain the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) evolution equation @xmath55 here we have replaced @xmath3 with @xmath56 ( we describe @xmath56 below ) , and using @xmath56 one can let @xmath57 .",
    "this can be done since the divergence can be treated by defining a distribution that can be integrated by subtracting a delta function from the singular term .",
    "we define the distribution , @xmath58 , such that for any given smooth function @xmath59 we have @xmath60 and then we replace the splitting function @xmath3 with @xmath56 given by @xmath61    in fact , it is @xmath56 and not @xmath3 that appears in the ap equations .",
    "the delta function comes from the fact that we have to take into account that a parent quark splitting into a quark and a gluon disappears .",
    "thus , we get contributions from the new particles but the one in the initial state no longer exists , and this must be taken into account . the coefficient in front of the delta function , @xmath62 ,",
    "is found by the requirement that the number of quarks is conserved , which means that the integral of @xmath56 over @xmath63 must be zero . in the case of gluons ( i.e a process where a gluon splits into two gluons ) the number of gluons is not conserved but the total energy is , therefore , in this case , the integral of @xmath64 over @xmath63 is zero .",
    "assume that @xmath16 is only moderately large and that @xmath8 is kept small .",
    "the splitting function for the process where a gluon splits into two gluons , @xmath65 , contains a pole , @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that for small @xmath8 and moderately large @xmath16 , this process is very probable and will dominate over splitting events involving quarks .",
    "therefore we now consider gluonic chains where a parton emits a gluon which then develops a chain of gluons by successive splittings into new gluons . in this region ,",
    "non - ordered ladders , though suppressed , will be more important and they have to be taken into account .",
    "this means that the transverse momenta , @xmath67 , can now also decrease . considering this new possibility , balistky , fadin , kuraev and",
    "lipatov derived a more complex evolution equation , which is known as the bfkl equation .",
    "the evolution in @xmath8 is given by @xmath68 here we have introduced the unitegrated distribution function , @xmath69 .",
    "there are various definitions of @xmath69 , and in the ldc model ( which is discussed in the next section ) it satisfies the following relation @xmath70    the kernel of the integral , @xmath71 , in equation  , is known as the bfkl kernel .",
    "the important thing here is to find the eigenvalues of this kernel . to leading order in @xmath72 , and for a fixed coupling constant @xmath73 ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue is given by @xmath74 .",
    "it can then be shown that the gluon distribution function is given by @xmath75    we will come back to the bfkl equation , and the so called bfkl pomeron , later when we discuss saturation .",
    "for now , one can note that bfkl and dglap are applicable in different regions . in the next section",
    "we will describe two models which interpolate between these two different regions , thus containing both the dglap and the bfkl physics .",
    "the first such model was proposed by catani , ciafaloni , fiorani and marchesini and is thus called the ccfm model .",
    "we will discuss purely gluonic chains and the last gluon in the chain is assumed to interact with a color neutral probe .",
    "one can usually order emissions in different variables , such as color , rapidity , transverse momentum and so on .",

    "this is used in the ccfm model where the initial state radiation is made up of gluons which are not followed , in rapidity , by a gluon with more energy , or equivalently positive light - cone momentum , @xmath76 .    with the selection of the initial state radiation described above , it was shown by the authors that the unintegrated distribution function is given by @xmath77 \\delta ( x -    \\prod_{j}^{n } z_j ) \\theta ( \\bar{q}-\\bar{q}_n z_n ) \\delta(k_{\\perp}^2",

    "they are given by @xmath82 here @xmath83 specifies the kinematic region allowed by the ordering constraints , and @xmath84 . in the ccfm model , only the singular terms , @xmath66 and @xmath85 , in the splitting functions",
    "are included .",
    "the @xmath66 pole is important in the bfkl region and the @xmath85 pole and the sudakov factor are more important in the dglap region . since the non - singular terms in the splitting function are not included , dglap is not fully reproduced in the large @xmath16 and the large @xmath8 limits .",
    "the ldc ( linked dipole chain ) model , @xcite , is a reformulation and a generalization of the ccfm model .",
    "the main idea in this model is that certain gluons in the initial state radiation of the ccfm model , namely those gluons which satisfy the constraint @xmath86 , can be treated as final state emissions from dipoles , which are formed by the remaining initial state gluons .",
    "these remaining gluons , the initial state gluons in the ldc model , will then satisfy @xmath87 .",
    "they will be ordered in both positive and negative light - cone momenta , @xmath88 .",
    "a single chain in the ldc model corresponds to several chains in ccfm , and it was shown in @xcite that the non - eikonal factors in ccfm add up to one , when one considers all contributions from these chains .",
    "the ordering , in both @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and the absence of the non - eikonal form factors , implies that ldc is forward - backward symmetric .",
    "if one starts from the probe end , which has large @xmath91 , and follows the chain towards the proton end , which has large @xmath92 , the situation will look the same , the minus and plus components will just change roles and we will have exactly the same ordering and the same distribution function . in the ldc model",
    "the distribution function satisfies the following evolution equation ( see eq.43 in @xcite ) @xmath93\\ ] ] here @xmath94 is the transverse momentum of the last gluon in the chain while @xmath95 is the momentum in the step before .",
    "the first term here is the dglap contribution where the transverse momentum increases in the last step , while the second term contains the probability that the transverse momentum decreases in the last step . for a more detailed discussion on these models , see @xcite .",
    "the idea of dipoles as emitters of radiation is quite natural in qcd .",

    "thus , it is not possible to tell whether the quark or the antiquark emitted the gluon .",
    "therefore it makes sense to regard the quark - antiquark pair as a color dipole , radiating coherently . in the region between the quark and the gluon ,",
    "the blue and antiblue color separation will give rise to the emission of softer gluons .",
    "but in directions further away the emissions from blue and antiblue will interfere destructively .",

    ", emission of softer gluons corresponds to a blue antiblue color dipole .",

    "these two variables are naturally connected by a fourier transform @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the light - cone wavefunction ( the zero on @xmath104 indicating that there are 0 gluons present ) and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are heavy quark and antiquark spinor indices , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the transverse coordinates of the quark and the antiquark respectively .",

    "we also define @xmath113 , which means that the transverse size of the initial dipole is , @xmath114 .",
    "the reason we choose to work with transverse coordinates instead of transverse momenta is that one can assume the partons to be frozen during emissions and the evolution process , which makes the analysis much easier .",
    "this is justified since the time scales for the processes that we consider are very short .",

    "as we mentioned earlier , the probability to emit small dipoles becomes infinitely large as the dipole size approaches zero . to deal with this we introduced a cutoff , @xmath124",

    "we will now develop an onium state using an ordering in rapidity , @xmath137 , such that the rapidity increases for each emission .",

    "this means that , if we allow very small @xmath96 we will violate energy conservation since the energy of the gluon will become larger than the energy of the mother dipole .",
    "hence , we can not allow too small dipole sizes .",
    "the positive light - cone momentum is essentially equal to the energy , and from now on we will refer to it as energy . let @xmath89 be the energy of the parent dipole and let the gluon be emitted at a rapidity @xmath137",
    ". denote by @xmath148 the energy of the gluon .",
    "we then have @xmath149    this means that we get a very natural cutoff for small dipoles , given by , @xmath150 . to make the program right - left symmetric , which means that the theory looks the same independent of which way we evolve , we must also demand @xmath90 conservation , which is described later .",
    "these observations are the main motivations for this thesis .",
    "we will now describe the monte carlo program , including energy conservation , developed to study the deeply inelastic scattering between a photon and a nucleus , and between two onium states .",
    "since we demand energy to be conserved , we must also take into account the full recoil effects .",
    "a single gluon will , in the dipole model , be a part of two independent dipoles and the question is how the two dipoles share the recoil from the emission .",
    "we solve this by assuming that when a dipole emits a gluon , the initial gluons , which make up the parent dipole , may contribute with all their energy .",
    "this means that the next time a neighboring dipole emits a gluon , the avaliable energy is reduced because one of its gluons has lost energy from an earlier emission .",
    "how much energy does each parton in the dipole give to the emitted gluon ?",
    "obviously the answer should be such that if the new gluon comes very close to one of the partons , that parton should take most of the recoil , while the other one should be less affected .",
    "there are , however , different ways to share the amount of energy between the partons .    consider the emission of gluon @xmath50 from the dipole @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath151 and @xmath152 denote the distance between the new gluon and parton @xmath153 and parton @xmath154 respectively .",

    "we have also studied alternative ways to share the recoils but the result does not depend sensitively on the exact formula . when we have generated an emission we always check that @xmath160 , which obviously must be satisfied .    to make the analysis simple",
    ", transverse momentum , @xmath161 , is only approximately conserved in the program .",
    "exact conservation of @xmath161 would be possible but is not essential for the purpose of this study . when a new gluon is emitted its transverse momentum is decided by @xmath162    the recoils on the emitters are given by @xmath163 otherwise we simply set @xmath164 , i.e we do nt change the transverse momenta .",
    "this simply means that the transverse momentum is decided only by the largest contribution .",
    "hence the transverse momentum of a parton will always be determined by the shortest distance to another parton , with which it has formed a dipole .",
    "since we change @xmath89 and @xmath142 we must , to be consistent , also change the rapidity @xmath137 .",
    "this is obviously done by setting @xmath165 the inequality is due to the fact that @xmath166 and @xmath167 . therefore the rapidity will always increase due to a recoil .",
    "there is however a problem with this ; as we order the emissions in rapidity the last emitted gluon will always have the largest rapidity , and we would like it to remain so .",
    "since the rapidity of the emitters increase due to recoil , there is the possibility that one of the emitters , or both of them , after the recoil ends up with a rapidity larger than the rapidity of the emitted gluon .",
    "the next time we emit a gluon , the rapidity of that emitter would then determine the region in which the new emission can occur , in a sense violating the ordering we had . to prevent this",
    "we require that @xmath168 ; if this constraint is not satisfied a new gluon is generated . without this constraint",
    "there would also be a lot of gluons in the final state which have rapidities larger than the maximum rapidity , due to the recoils",

    "we can , however , also get extremely large dipoles , especially when the avaliable energy is low and the rapidity is not very large .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that @xmath169 gets very large for limited @xmath137 and small @xmath89 .",
    "we can also take extremely small steps in rapidity because the phase space avaliable permits this , see figure [ pminus ] . when we are about to emit a new gluon we let the computer generate an emission for each existing dipole , and then we choose the emission which has the lowest @xmath137 . because of what we said above , the step sizes in @xmath137 can , and indeed will , be extremely small which result in a huge number of dipoles and very long running times .",

    "therefore one would need to keep track of all the emissions during the evolution , this is not a problem in a mc simulation , after all that is what we have been doing in this thesis , but for a theoretical approach it is a major problem ( for a constant @xmath124 , these problems does not appear since it does nt matter how many emissions there have been or which dipole is about to emit , the cut - off is the same anyway ) .",

    "if one could just find such an equation , deriving a modified bk equation would not be difficult .",
    "of course the new equation should not be too difficult to analyze , if one finds an equation that is not even numerically solvable it would not be so interesting .",
    "let us summarize the thesis",
    ". in other studies energy conservation has frequently been found to have a quantitatively large effect , and also to correspond to a significant part of nlo corrections .",
    "our main objective has been to study saturation effects in dis . to do this ,",
    "we have constructed a monte carlo program which is based on mueller s dipole formulation and respects energy conservation . using our model we have studied @xmath295 , which is , in the bfkl approximation , defined by the relationship @xmath293 , and seen that there is a clear difference compared to previous studies , such as @xcite , where energy conservation is not included . throughout the thesis we have been working in the large @xmath1 limit .    in onium - onium collisions",
    "we have seen that the difference between the one pomeron and the unitarised cross sections are quite small .",
    "it is hard to say if the cross section saturates but its growth with energy is reduced and we obtain @xmath295 in the interval 0.10 - 0.15 . in onium - nucleus collisions the difference between the unitarised and the one pomeron cross sections are larger , and the growth of the cross section slows down quite rapidly .",
    "it is also clearer in onium - nucleus scattering that ln@xmath288 does not depend linearly on @xmath109 , except for small @xmath109 .",
    "the saturation sets in quite early and the growth of the cross section becomes smaller and smaller . in the onium - nucleus case",
    "however , one should be quite careful before drawing any conclusions .",
    "this process was not studied in detail in this thesis but it is going to be studied more deeply in future investigations . as we mentioned in the text the dipole distribution for the nucleus should be modified by taking into account normalization .",
    "the distribution we used was a very simple one and can be improved .    in the second part of the thesis we studied the effects of dipole fusion processes . using symmetry arguments , and in a factorizing approximation",
    ", we proposed an expression for the fusion factor , presented in  .",
    "we used this expression in our monte carlo program , calculating cross sections for onium - onium collisions .",
    "due to lack of time we only studied the effects on the unitarised amplitude and without energy conservation .",
    "the value for the fusion parameter , @xmath352 , can not be determined by theoretical arguments however , and we have here considered various values for this parameter .",
    "varying @xmath352 we obtained different values for @xmath295 , and we saw that fusion processes are not as important as energy conservation , in slowing down the growth of @xmath288 , at least for @xmath411 . before any definite conclusions are made though , the program should be tested more and it should be run with better statistics",
    ". it would also be interesting to study larger rapidity intervals , especially when including fusion processes .",
    "fusion processes become interesting when the gluon density is high , which occurs at high rapidites .",
    "studying larger @xmath109 intervals is very time consuming however , especially for onium evolution without energy conservation .",
    "the problem is that the number of dipoles becomes very large as @xmath109 increases , which limits the @xmath109-range avaliable for numerical studies .",
    "we should also repeat that one needs to use a large @xmath352-values , larger than 10 at least , to see any significant effects of fusion processes . since we derived   in the large @xmath1 limit , which means that only neighboring dipoles can undergo fusion ,",
    "the effects of fusion events are not so large for small and moderate @xmath109 , ( @xmath412 ) .",
    "energy conservation has a larger effect on the growth of the cross section and its effects are seen earlier than fusion processes .",
    "therefore energy conservation should have higher priority than fusion processes in dis investigations .",
    "i would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor gsta gustafson who spent a lot of time answering my many questions , and from whom i certainly learned a lot .",
    "i would also like to thank leif lnnblad for his , much appreciated , help with the monte carlo program .",
    "this thesis could not have been done without his help .",
    "finally i would like to thank torbjrn sjstrand for helping me with gnuplot and my fellow masters students for keeping me good company .",
    "in this appendix we derive the formula  . to find the @xmath137 distribution we use the formula  .",
    "remember that @xmath183 and @xmath184 . therefore we can write the splitting factor as @xmath413 the integration is done over all of @xmath414 except for two circles with radius @xmath415 where the first one is centered at @xmath232 and the second one at @xmath416 .",
    "the rapidity dependence in @xmath417 comes from the fact that @xmath418 . using the veto algorithm",
    "the @xmath137 distribution is given by @xmath419 here @xmath420 is the primitive function of @xmath417 , @xmath421 is the initial value of @xmath137 and @xmath190 is a random number .",
    "finding @xmath422 is easy as long as @xmath124 is sufficiently small .",
    "but the integral in   is difficult to evaluate when @xmath124 is not small and since we have a running @xmath124 we can not always be sure that @xmath124 is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore one needs to use an auxiliary function @xmath423 , satisfying @xmath424 . before we do this",
    ", we note that @xmath425 is symmetric around @xmath426 .",
    "therefore we do not have to consider the whole @xmath414 plane but it is enough to look at the plane where @xmath427 .",

    "when we generate the @xmath180 , we reflect them around the symmetry axis , @xmath426 , with a @xmath442 probability .",
