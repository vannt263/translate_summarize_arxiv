    "table [ tab : charact ] summarises the measured cluster characteristics : their redshift , @xmath3 , the number of members with known redshift , @xmath4 , the colour of the red sequence , the adopted colour cut , the concentration index and the ( asymptotic ) number of member galaxies brighter than @xmath5 mag . the latter quantity is computed twice : for red galaxies ( @xmath6 , 8th column ) and without any colour selection ( @xmath7 , last column ) .",
    "@xmath8 is comparable to the cluster richness as measured by abell ( 1958 ) : the magnitude range in which galaxies are counted is very similar and our asymptotic measurement of @xmath7 is equivalent to the 3 mpc radius adopted by abell ( 1958 ) in order to encompass the whole cluster .",
    "the three clusters have , therefore , @xmath9 to @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the standard ( abell 1958 ) richness .",
    "in the bo sample the cluster richness increases with redshift ( andreon & ettori 1999 ) : the highest redshift clusters are of richness @xmath12 or @xmath13 , being by far the richest of all the sample , a result of a bias in the cluster sample available at that time ( see also kron 1994 ) .",
    "our three clusters are extracted from the eis survey , which covers a small sky area . as a consequence",
    "the probability of getting a very rich cluster is low and this is why our sample contains common and lower richness clusters , which turns out to be comparable in richness to the low redshift bo sample .",
    "table [ tab : bo ] shows the blue fraction , @xmath14 , of our three clusters computed at different radii for galaxies brighter than two evolved limiting magnitudes .",
    "this table also lists poissonian errors on the blue fraction , @xmath15 .    while postponing to the next sections a thorough discussion of the values listed in table 3 , we compare in figure 7 the values derived for the bo sample and for our three clusters .",
    "the bo _ extrapolated _ value of the blue fraction is around 0.35 at the mean redshift of our three clusters .",
    "cl0048 - 2942 has a blue fraction compatible with the extrapolation of the bo linear trend .",
    "the two other clusters have lower blue fractions . our data , therefore , do not show any strong evidence for the presence of an increasing @xmath14 with look  back time , in agreement with the approximately constant fraction of blue galaxies within @xmath16 found by ellingson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . before drawing any final conclusion from this plot",
    "it is instructive to take a deeper look at the analysis performed by other authors in the literature because different , and sometimes contradictory , results have been obtained on the bo effect .      in this paragraph",
    "we will examine how @xmath14 changes as a function of the adopted luminosity cut  off . at low redshift luminosity functions of different morphological types have different shapes ( e.g. bingelli , sandage & tammann 1988 ; andreon 1998a ) and therefore it is likely that the luminosity function of galaxies of different colours differs and that the fraction of blue galaxies will depend on the luminosity cut  off .",
    "on the other hand , bo have shown that as long as this cut  off value is in the @xmath17 mag range , the blue fraction does not depend on the exact value of the limiting magnitude for four of their clusters .",
    "a similar result was found by kodama & bower ( 2001 ) for 6 emss clusters and by ellingson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on a sample of 15 clusters .",
    "fairley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) observed a more complex situation : in 5 out of 8 clusters the blue fraction was identical when a @xmath18 mag or @xmath19 mag cut ",
    "off was adopted , whereas for the three remaining cases @xmath14 was lower by 0.1 ( a 1 @xmath1 effect ) when the brighter cut ",
    "off was adopted . for two of our clusters , cl0048 - 2942 and cl2249 - 3958",
    ", we can make a measure of the bo effect both at evolved @xmath20 and @xmath21 limiting magnitudes : the @xmath14 of these two clusters remains constant within 1 @xmath1 ( see table [ tab : bo ] ) .",
    "for the third cluster , cl2245 - 3954 , we can not perform such a comparison because data are not deep enough .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 does not seem to depend critically on the adopted luminosity cut  off .      in this paragraph",
    "we will examine how @xmath14 changes as a function of the cluster radial cut  off .",
    "we expect some radial dependence of the blue fraction because of the well known colour segregation in clusters . at lower redshift , fairley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and kodama & bower ( 2001 ) show that the blue fraction radial profiles differ from cluster to cluster . bo show that the @xmath14 radial profile depends on redshift .",
    "it is therefore dangerous to assume a universal @xmath14 radial profile for all clusters . at the higher redshifts of our sample , by taking @xmath22 instead of @xmath3 , the blue fraction of two clusters stays constant within 1 @xmath1 ( table [ tab : bo ] ) , whereas the blue fraction increases for cl2245 - 3954 .",
    "margoniner & de carvalho ( 2000 ) and margoniner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( mc & m , hereafter ) calculate richness and blue fractions inside a fixed metric diameter of 0.7 mpc ( for @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 ) .",
    "this choice is fundamentally different from the one adopted by bo , whose metric radius scales with the cluster size .",
    "because of the existence of the morphological segregation ( and hence of a colour segregation ) , the blue fractions of clusters of different sizes are not directly comparable .    in order to remove the obvious @xmath14 dependence on cluster size , mc & m parametrize it with a power law as a function of the cluster richness ,",
    "i.e. they assume that scale , richness and colour segregation are tightly correlated , and that the correlation is the same for all clusters and does not depend on @xmath25 . in the light of the results quoted above",
    ", such an assumption seems debatable .    as a test case ,",
    "let us consider our two clusters cl0048 - 2942 and cl2245 - 3954 .",
    "measuring their @xmath14 and richness according to mc & c prescriptions , we obtain for both clusters the same richness ( @xmath26 ) , whereas our asymptotic richness of the two clusters differs by a factor of two ( see table 2 ) . in order to obtain the @xmath14 values derived according to the bo prescription , we need to correct the @xmath14 derived in a 0.7 mpc diameter by -0.16 and + 0.24 , respectively , whereas the correction , according to mc & c prescription should be the same .",
    "the remaining cluster , cl2249 - 3958 , is contaminated in its outskirts by the presence of a foreground group , and therefore its mc & c richness is overestimated : the statistical correction adopted by them removes only the average background , whereas the radial profile suggested by bo helps a lot in detecting groups superposed on the cluster line of sight .",
    "this is not a rare situation , and if the measured richness is incorrect , the richness ",
    "dependent correction is incorrect too .",
    "the margoniner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) claim that richer clusters tend to have lower @xmath14 is therefore a simple restatement of the morphology  radius relation : the larger and richer the cluster is , the lower is its spiral fraction ( and therefore the blue fraction ) in a fixed metric aperture .",
    "this is not informative at all on the dependence between richness and @xmath14 ( as defined by bo and/or abell ) .",
    "a similar fixed aperture for measuring the blue fraction has been recently used by de propris et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and by goto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , so similar concern applies to their work .",
    "a survey of the colour cuts adopted in the literature shows different choices .",
    "kodama & bower ( 2001 ) adopted colour cut is @xmath27 to @xmath28 mag , depending on redshift , whereas ellingson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) adopted @xmath29 to @xmath30 mag instead for the very same data ( filters and clusters ) .",
    "inspection of fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) tables , used by kodama & bower ( 2001 ) in their calculations , seems to confirm ellingson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) results .",
    "margoniner et al .",
    "claim that @xmath31 mag is equivalent to @xmath32 mag , and adopt the former cut for their work . however , at @xmath33 , @xmath32 mag is the colour difference between ( spectrophotometric ) e and sab galaxy types ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) , whereas @xmath31 mag is the difference in colour between e and scd . by choosing @xmath31 mag ,",
    "there are spectrophotometric types that will be counted as red by margoniner et al .",
    "but as blue by bo . since the evolution of galaxies in clusters seems to be rather different between early- and late - type spirals ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , mc & m are sampling a population of galaxies different from the one sampled by bo .    for our three higher redshift clusters , by adopting @xmath31 mag ( instead of @xmath32 mag as bo prescribe ) lowers blue fractions by about 0.1 , simply because spirals of intermediate spectrophotometric types are now counted as red .",
    "it is therefore clear that blue fractions computed assuming different colour cuts can not be directly compared .",
    "the different mc & m colour cut choice and the different aperture adopted produce , as a final effect , a @xmath34 between the two methods that can be as large as 0.4 , for an average @xmath14 of 0.2 .    in a series of papers on the bo effect , rakos and collaborators ( e.g. rakos & schombert 1995 ; rakos , schombert , & kreidl 1991 ; steindling , brosch , & rakos 2001 ) adopt a different definition for the reference colour : their colour offset is measured relatively to the colour of a present day elliptical , instead of using as reference the observed colour  magnitude relation . in this latter case , the colour is observed to evolve with redshift from the ( redder ) location of present  day ellipticals ( e.g. stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) ; this is expected since the age of the universe at a given redshift is an upper limit to the age of the stars at that redshift .",
    "in other terms , their offset is not given with respect to the colour of passively evolving objects having the age of the universe at that redshift ( as in the bo prescription ) , but with respect to 15 gyr old galaxies ( even in a universe that may be only 7 gyr old , for example ) .",
    "with rakos et al.s choice , a cluster composed exclusively of passively evolving galaxies naturally increases its blue fraction with look  back time ( i.e. @xmath25 ) . at high enough redshift",
    ", their colour cut will eventually include in the blue fraction even the reddest galaxies at that redshift .",
    "in fact , this `` high enough '' redshift corresponds to the redshift of our clusters , the reddest galaxies of which are almost 0.2 mag bluer than the colour of present  day ellipticals , thus qualifying to be classified ",
    "blue \" by the rakos et al . criterion .",
    "while their choice is fully auto - consistent , their @xmath14 can not be directly compared with the bo one , because the two definitions are equal only at @xmath35 . in particular , one needs to de  emphasize the rakos et al .",
    "claim that at @xmath36 almost all galaxies are blue : this is a consequence of their definition of  blue \" since at @xmath37 no galaxy can be red enough to be classified as red by their criterion , simply due to the reduced age of the universe at such an epoch . for this reason ,",
    "it is preferable to adopt the bo definition of the blue fraction , as we did in our analysis , which separates the bluing due to the young age of the universe from the bluing due to the bo effect itself .    given these considerations , we believe that rakos et al.s large blue fraction at high redshift is no longer in contradiction with the low blue fraction at high redshift found by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and , in a more general way , their claim of a clear evidence of a bo effect should be considered with caution .",
    "thus far , we have assumed that any observed sample ( ours and those of other authors ) is a representative sample , i.e. that selection criteria , if present , are benign .",
    "andreon & ettori ( 1999 ) have shown that , instead , for the bo sample this is not the case , and that the high redshift clusters they studied are not the ancestors of their present - day clusters .",
    "in other words , and for that particular sample , one is comparing `` unripe apples to ripe oranges '' in order to understand `` how fruit ripens '' ( andreon & ettori 1999 ) .",
    "the three high redshift clusters analysed in this paper are much poorer than the high redshift clusters in the bo sample , thus being more similar , from this point of view , to bo s low redshift clusters . on the other hand , they are much smaller ( their @xmath3 is smaller ) than the large majority of the clusters in the bo sample , and so they possibly consist in another class of clusters with respect to the ones gathered in the bo sample .",
    "the three clusters we study in the present paper have been optically selected . as explained in aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and in andreon & ettori ( 1999 ) , among all clusters of a given mass , an optical selection favours those with an unusual population of star forming galaxies .",
    "since selection criteria and band  shift effects become more and more important as redshift increases , the optical selection might artificially increase the blue fraction as the redshift increases , hence mimicking the bo effect . with our data",
    ", we can test whether our cluster selection is biased by such an unusual population .    from the models",
    "( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) we expect that most of the cluster blue galaxies , unless they are forming stars at a significant rate , fall below the limiting magnitude of @xmath38 used by lobo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in the process of detecting clusters , ie .",
    "we would expect them to be fainter than that limiting magnitude . in order to mimick a selection less biased by galaxies with an high star formation rate ,",
    "we remove the blue galaxies from our three clusters , and we measure the detectability of the red population by re - inserted them in the eis catalogue at various positions . as we do not know the membership of each individual red galaxy in the cluster line of sight , we did 101 realizations of each background  subtracted cluster , each one using a background sample that is randomly extracted from our control field sample .",
    "each cluster was then inserted 10 times ( for a total of 1010 simulations per cluster ) in the eis catalogue , avoiding areas where clusters are detected .",
    "we recovered the inserted clusters 33 , 50 and 65% of the times for cl2245 - 3954 , cl2249 - 3958 and cl0048 - 2942 , respectively . for the detection of these three clusters , and especially of the former two ,",
    "the presence of an important ( over the whole cluster ) blue population turns out to be essential , because clusters similar to those inserted ( but without a blue population ) are underrepresented by a factor of 2 ( = 3/(0.33 + 0.50 + 0.65 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the simple fact of having selected the sample from optical photometry seems to have biased the blue fraction ( toward higher values observable at higher-@xmath25 ) by preferentially selecting , among all possible clusters , the ones with a larger blue fraction , that are more easily detected .",
    "we remind the reader that our clusters are quite small with respect to the ones listed in bo ( see figure 6 )",
    ". their detectability would be even lower , if they were of median size , for the same richness .",
    "the small @xmath3 radii of our clusters , given their richness , is a further reason to believe that the detected clusters are just the tip of the iceberg .",
    "the same concerns may apply to other clusters selected in similar ways .",
    "last , but not least , to conclude our discussion on the effects that have a bearing on the detection of the bo effect , we should not neglect the way errors are defined .",
    "the error associated to the computed fraction of blue galaxies strongly depends on the error definition : should or should it not take into account the fact that we observe @xmath39 cluster member galaxies subject to poissonian fluctuations ? if the aim is to measure the error on the blue fraction of the parent distribution from which the observed cluster is a member , then the answer is yes , it should . on the other hand ,",
    "if one restricts oneself to measuring the error on the blue fraction of one specific cluster , then this is not needed .",
    "this fact becomes clear by reading gehrels ( 1986 ) that we quote here :  we consider [ ... ] the case where an observer is measuring two different kinds of distinguishable events .",
    "it is assumed that [ ... ] the number of events of each type [ ... ] is distributed according to poissonian statistics .",
    "the objective is to obtain confidence limits on the ratio of the two event rates based on the measurement of a small number of events \" , i.e. errors for the @xmath14 fraction in our case . as gehrels ( 1986 ) shows , the joint probability to observe @xmath40 red galaxies and @xmath41 blue galaxies is equal to the poisson probability of observing @xmath42 galaxies times the binomial probability for obtaining specifically @xmath40 red and @xmath41 blue galaxies , given that the combined number of galaxies observed is @xmath42 .",
    "the binomial probability alone , adopted eg . by metevier , romer & ulmer ( 2000 ) , where @xmath43 is the number of trials , and",
    "@xmath44 is the probability of success .",
    "] , gives errors that are somewhat conservative for small @xmath42 .",
    "such a discussion would be useless if the error coming from other sources ( the background subtraction , for example ) dominated the overall error budget .",
    "this is not , indeed , the case for the bo clusters , for which the full error ( including everything ) listed in bo is often smaller than the gehrels error alone .",
    "if one adopts the gehrels ( 1986 ) error formula , then the error on the blue fraction of cl2245 - 3954 becomes non ",
    "zero , as it should be .    to summarize , bo and - given the absence of similar remarks in the literature - most of the literature seem to quote errors by assuming that `` repetition of experiment '' means `` re - observing the same cluster '' ie .",
    "observing exactly the same number of galaxies . here , instead , we claim that errors should be quoted as if `` repetition of experiment '' means `` observation of any cluster drawn from the same parent population '' .",
    "the underestimate of the error implies that any existing trend of the blue fraction with @xmath25 has been emphasized more than the statistics allow .",
    "figure 8 shows the blue fraction as a function of redshift , plotted with error bars that now take into account the binomial term , the poissonian term , and over  poissonian background subtraction errors . for the bo clusters ,",
    "we simply add ( quadratically ) to the error quoted by bo the ones computed according to gehrels ( 1986 ) because of lack of information .",
    "the figure also includes our three clusters , shown as solid dots .",
    "given the large error bars , the data can , after all , be described by a constant @xmath14 .",
    "through the observations of three clusters at @xmath0 , of richness comparable to the low redshift sample of butcher & oemler ( 1984 ; bo ) , we have determined their fraction of blue galaxies , @xmath14 .",
    "according to the standard analyses ( those presented in bo , of widespread acceptance and shown in figure 7 ) , two clusters have a low blue fraction for their redshifts , and the fraction of the third one is compatible with the expected value .",
    "we studied the impact of relaxing each one of the bo criteria in the calculation of the blue fraction .    ",
    "the exact choice of the luminosity cut is not critical , provided it differs by 1 mag or less .    ",
    "adopting a unique metric radii for all clusters , regardless of them being large or small , and eventually correcting for the richness dependence as is sometimes performed in the literature , is not informative on the bo effect because of the contamination by the colour segregation in clusters .",
    "the @xmath14 measured within a metric aperture is therefore informative about something different from the bo effect .    ",
    "the colour cut is also important . in some cases ,",
    "we are unable to reproduce colour cuts of other authors ; in other cases we show that the adopted colour cuts differ from those defined in bo . since galaxies of different colours have probably different star formation histories , then the comparison of blue fractions derived using different cuts is not straightforward . for our three clusters ,",
    "the blue fraction decreases by 0.1 when adopting the more liberal @xmath31 colour cut , instead of the standard @xmath32 .    ",
    "the adoption of a correct reference colour is a critical point .",
    "if the reference colour does not change appropriately with look  back time , then the measurements of the bo effect are contaminated by the bluing due to the younger galaxy ages at higher redshift .",
    "two of our clusters at @xmath0 have a huge blue fraction according to rakos et al.s definition , simply because the universe is so young at @xmath0 that no stellar population can be red enough to be called red according to their criterion .",
    "however , this has nothing to do with the bo effect .",
    "finally , a re  analysis of the error computations usually performed in the literature shows that the @xmath14 errors quoted by bo ( and likely by other authors ) underestimate the real errors .",
    "if we plot the original bo data together with our three high redshift clusters , with the newly determined error bars , we can not exclude a constant @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we conclude that :     the correct comparison of bo effect determinations reported by different authors is a task as difficult as performing the measurement itself and both should be done with extreme carefulness .",
    " twenty years after the original intuition by butcher & oemler , we are still in the process of ascertaining the reality of the bo effect .    in a future paper",
    "we will present a bo  style analysis for an x  ray selected sample of clusters collected by the xmm ",
    "lss project ( pierre et al . 2003 ) , hence overcoming the biases of the cluster optical selection .",
    "we warmly thank reinaldo de carvalho for numerous discussions on the subject .",
