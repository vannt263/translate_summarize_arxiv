    "knowlege of the three  dimensional distribution of matter in the universe at @xmath8 is limited .",

    "stable _ uniform density , etc .",
    "do not provide direct evidence about the distribution of visible matter in the present epoch ) .",
    "for @xmath10 the distribution of visible matter is clearly inhomogeneous , with large voids and clustering , and various analyses have produced results that are equivalent to claiming scale invariance for the correlation integral , that @xmath11 , with one school ( @xcite , @xcite ) reporting that @xmath12 for @xmath13 , whereas the other ( @xcite , @xcite ) reports that @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the correlation integral and scaling exponent @xmath2 are defined in part [ sect : correlation_integral ] .",
    "roughly speaking , one can think of the scaling exponent @xmath2 as a correlation dimension , but not as hausdorff or box  counting dimension .",
    "we will explain why the reported claims of scale invariance may be spurious unless the matter distribution actually is , to a very good approximation , monofractal .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to explain the need for a more careful analysis of observational data than has heretofore been performed .",
    "the second aim is to provide that analysis ( part [ sect : data ] ) .",
    "the third is to explain and eliminate the confusion over the term multifractal .",
    "finally we will explain why a `` nonanalytic '' density does not rule out the use of differential equations .    in any attempt to extract scaling exponents from log  log plots of correlation or generating functions",
    "a conservative criterion in both critical phenomena and dynamical systems theory is that linearity should be exhibited over at least three decades , which would require data out to at least @xmath16 in astronomy .",
    "the reason for this is that there are too many different functions @xmath17 that do nt scale with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , but @xmath20 vs. @xmath5 may nevertheless _ appear _ to have a constant slope over a short enough range of @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath21 provides a relevant example : this function is not scale invariant because of _ two _ exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but it is easy to exhibit the _ illusion _ of scale invariance by plotting @xmath20 vs. @xmath5 over only two decades ( see figure [ fig : logplot ] ) .",
    "if one questions the controversial claim of scale invariance over two decades up to @xmath24 , then must also one question the _ widely accepted _ claim of scale invariance , _ also _ over only two decades , up to @xmath25 .    to make our viewpoint clear to the reader we recapitulate briefly the controversy over scaling in this field .",
    "the earliest attempts to extract @xmath2 were based upon the expectation of homogeneity at larger scales , with inhomogeneities confined to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a correlation length . by confusing an amplitude with a correlation ( i.e.  characteristic )",
    "length @xcite @xmath28 was obtained , which is inconsistent with the observed clustering and voids out to @xmath29 , and beyond .",
    "coleman and pietronero @xcite and martinez et  al .",
    "@xcite have argued instead that the known data are scale invariant , and correspondingly that there is no correlation length .",
    "early attempts to dismiss this point of view as the result of `` large deviations '' due to `` unfair samples '' failed when it became clear that the apparent scale invariance is the rule and not the exception . as a @xmath30 order description",
    "this seems to be correct , but we show in part [ sect : data ] that a refinement of the method of @xcite ( see part [ sect : correlation_integral ] ) leads to the conclusion that the data are inadequate to draw a conclusion for or against multifractal scaling , although it is clear that simple fractal scaling , with a single exponent @xmath2 as claimed by the pietronero school , is not indicated by the data .",
    "fractal or not , it is clear that there is , as yet , no evidence from galaxy redshift surveys of any crossover to homogeneity .",
    "this is a good question because , as one expert in statistical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics put it , if you ca nt calculate anything then you can still talk about scaling .",
    "furthermore , most phenomena in nature do not scale , or at least have not been shown to scale ( the polls are not yet closed on the question of multifractal scaling in the inertial ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and dissipation ( @xcite & @xcite ) ranges of fluid turbulence , and the early returns are not entirely convincing ) .",
    "in fact , there are only a few known reasons why anything should scale , aside from dimensional analysis ( reynolds number scaling , which works pretty well in fluid mechanics so long as one sticks to qualitative considerations and does not look hard at the numbers ) .",
    "let us enumerate the ( known ) ways .",
    "first , there is scaling of all sorts of correlation functions and other thermodynamic quantities if you are close enough ( within @xmath31 of @xmath32 , at least ) to a second order phase transition .",
    "the problem with this is first that the universe is not in thermodynamic equilibrium ( tde ) : nonuniformities like spiral galaxies and dna are not generated systematically at small scales in a system in tde .",
    "second , there is no reason why the universe should be tuned precisely to a critical point ( where @xmath33 ) .",
    "critical phenomena are popular because the scaling indices are universal , depending only on symmetry and dimension , which allows a theorist to forget about worse details than those that plague experimentalists and calculate the scaling indices of real ferromagnets , for example , by using ising models or @xmath34 models ( @xcite )",
    ".    we can also consider dynamical critical phenomena , where universality classes can still be defined for scaling exponents based only on symmetry and dimension , but that does nt help : we are still restricted to systems that have only very small deviations from thermal equilibrium .",
    "large excursions from tde are nt allowed at small scales in these systems .",
    "galaxies have been modelled on the basis of critical phenomena far from tde by using a particular cellular automaton ( @xcite ) near the percolation threshhold .",
    "nice patterns can be produced that look like spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) , but who tunes the galactic system to stay near the percolation threshold ?",
    "this model does nt yet have enough physics in it to be falsifiable .",
    "for those who believe that scaling is ubiquitous in nature , but do nt expect that mother nature tunes phenomena to a critical point , there is soc ( self  organized criticality ) .",
    "the idea of soc ( @xcite ) is based on driven dissipative dynamical systems far from equilibrium that quite naturally lie at a borderline of chaos , for a large range of parameter values , and therefore require no parameter  tuning .",
    "criticality ( a borderline of chaos ) means that all liapunov exponents must vanish ( some positive exponents are usually allowed in the literature because models where all of them vanish for a _",
    "finite _ range of control parameter values ( @xcite ) are unknown ) . scaling exponents in soc",
    "are argued to be universal because they are expected to be parameter  independent .",
    "the main problem with soc is that no one has yet found an example of a dynamical system where the idea has been realized , criticality without parameter tuning , criticality that persists while parameters are varied .",
    "the soc idea is usually illustrated by a sandpile model that has no tunable parameters because the parameters in the model were _ implicitly _ tuned to criticality and then forgotten .",
    "soc purports to provide a universal explanation of fractal scaling indices which , if we follow the scaling enthusiasts , should be ubiquitous in nature , but _ fractal and multifractal exponents are not universal and ca nt be used to define universality classes_. the different models used to try to describe the ( still inadequate ) data on the inertial and dissipation ranges of fluid turbulence provide examples of this ( @xcite & @xcite ) .",
    "sandpile models of soc reproduce certain qualitative features of block spring models of earthquakes , but the block spring models do not produce the parameter  independent criticality demanded by soc ( @xcite ) .",
    "soc has not been defined unambiguously because universality classes for soc have not been defined . in the absence of universality classes",
    "one can not claim that a simple automaton like the sandpile model represents a complicated or complex dynamical system that occurs in nature ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , there are the fractals that are generated in the phase spaces of critical and _ chaotic driven  dissipative _ dynamical systems far from thermal equilibrium . the scaling indices that describe the fractals that occur in chaos are _ not universal_. that s ok , because while the fractal dimensions are parameter - dependent the fractals persist ( in distorted form ) as the parameters are varied over relatively wide ranges ( this is usually what happens in  soc  models too ) . given the coarsegrained fractal support generated by a driven  dissipative dynamical system ( `` support '' of a distribution",
    "is defined in part [ sect : empirical_dist ] ) , nonuniform distributions on that support are typically multifractal , meaning that the coarsegrained density becomes more and more spiky ( and perhaps also intermittent with voids ) as the distribution is resolved at finer and finer scales of observation .",
    "the corresponding densities would be nearly everywhere nondifferentiable if the mathematicians fiction of an infinite  precision limit were not ruled out empirically .",
    "conservative dynamical systems ( like gravity without dissipation / driving ) can not generate fractals in phase space : the support of any distribution generated by a conservative dynamical system is space  filling ( liouville s theorem ) . space ",
    "filling means that the support has the dimension of the phase space , whereas a fractal support has a nonintegral dimension less than that of the phase space .",
    "however , a conservative dynamical system far from thermal equilibrium can also generate multifractal coarsegrained distributions on the space  filling support . _",
    "a noninteger correlation integral scaling exponent @xmath2 does not suggest that the galaxy distribution has a fractal support : nonintegral @xmath2 is consistent with multifractal distributions on space  filling supports . _",
    "the problem with all of this is that it does not explain anything , as yet : the fractals and multifractals discussed above all occur in the very high dimensional phase space of all of the galaxies ( each galaxy is treated as a point particle here and below ) , and we do not know how those distributions would look when projected onto the three dimensional space of observation in astronomy . in other words , we do nt have a quantitative explanation for where fractal ( including multifractal ) galaxy clusters should come from . in practice , it makes more sense to consider hydrodynamic models of galaxy formation and clustering .",
    "hydrodynamics demands a coarsegrained description of the density .",
    "coarsegrained descriptions are precisely what are provided by the multifractal formalism ( see vergassola et  al .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a hydrodynamic approach to clustering and voids ) .",
    "unable at this time to contribute to the dynamical theory of galaxy formation , let us forget temporarily that no theorist can yet convincingly explain the origin of fractal galaxy clustering , if it exists , and turn instead to the question how astronomical data should be analyzed in order to decide the much easier question _ whether _ fractal clustering is indicated by the observational data .",
    "in what follows we consider only finitely many data points @xmath35 in some space , the observational data . to present the ideas in the clearest possible way we assume that the space is one  dimensional ( excepting section [ sect : correlation_integral ] on the correlation integral , where the dimension of space is irrelevant ) .",
    "the ideas of sections [ sect : clustering_voids][sect : optimal_partitioning ] are admittedly heuristic and can only be made rigorous by the use of generating partitions found in the phase space of certain nonintegrable dynamical systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the heuristic description is limited to one dimension ( generating partitions are not so limited ) , but our one dimensional treatment is adequate to the purpose of resolving the prevailing confusion over `` multifractals '' and `` nonanalytic '' densities .",
    "we assume that the @xmath35 data points in our one dimensional space are confined to the unit interval , because any finite interval can be converted into the unit interval by rescaling . with lengths denoted by @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 in all that follows ( planar and three dimensional cosmological data are also assumed to be rescaled so that @xmath38 in the discussion of part [ sect : correlation_integral ] ) .",
    "coarsegraining of the data set requires only that we cover the @xmath35 points by @xmath39 nonoverlapping intervals of size @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , we can take @xmath41 intervals of size @xmath42 , @xmath43 intervals of size @xmath44 , and so on . all that is required to avoid overlap is @xmath45 ; coarsegraining per se is not unique .",
    "the only other requirement , so far , is that we must choose the intervals so that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the smallest distance between two points in the sample ( a single point can not be coarsegrained , so that an interval containing only one point is meaningless ) .",
    "we shall see that the desire of the theorist to approximate @xmath48 by @xmath49 , where @xmath49 goes to zero , has led to serious errors in data analysis . in our analysis",
    "@xmath48 is always finite because it contains at least two _ real _ data points .    in any efficient",
    "coarsegraining the intervals that cover the points must be _ nonoverlapping _ , coarsegrainings that are space - filling ( meaning that @xmath50 ) satisfy this criterion but do not separate voids from clusters . for data with voids",
    "we should construct a coarsegraining that is not space - filling , one where @xmath51 , in order to cover all of the clusters while excluding the largest voids .",
    "such a coarsegraining is more efficient than an arbitrary one . with the desire for efficiency in mind",
    "the idea is first to remove all of the largest voids .",
    "then we choose the interval size @xmath52 , where the intervals @xmath53 , all of roughly the same characteristic size , represent the @xmath54 largest voids in the sample , and @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath56 first generation intervals required to cover the @xmath35 data points are not space - filling because @xmath57 , by construction . if , beneath the @xmath56 intervals now covering the data , there are still voids and clustering then we can continue systematically by removing all voids of next largest characteristic size : in the second generation of coarsegraining simply choose @xmath58 intervals of size @xmath59 where the intervals @xmath60 represent the sizes of @xmath61 largest voids covered by the @xmath56 intervals @xmath62 . this iterative procedure may be continued so long as we can distinguish clusters from voids .",
    "there are two ways that it can terminate .",
    "either we reach a scale @xmath63 where the points are relatively evenly spaced over those intervals ( so that there is no longer a distinction between clusters and voids ) , or else clustering continues all the way down to the finite limit @xmath64 , where @xmath48 roughly characterizes an interparticle spacing and will be defined more precisely in part [ sect : optimal_partitioning ] .",
    "the procedure outlined above describes the idea of a more efficient partitioning than a space  filling one , a more efficient coarsegraining of the data set because the largest voids are systematically excluded , generation by generation in n. we do not have only one partition but a hierarchy @xmath65 of partitions , each with interval sizes @xmath40 .    a pencil and paper sketch of about sixteen points with two big voids of roughly the same size , but with three or more very nonuniform first generation clusters , e.g. figure [ fig : nonuniform ]",
    ", shows that the method described above will produce an efficient partition only if the clustering is relatively uniform , only if all clusters in a each generation are all of about the same size .",
    "when this is not the case , when the clustering is very nonuniform ( as in figure [ fig : nonuniform ] ) , then the procedure outlined above will not produce an efficient partition and may even fail to cover the set . in that case",
    "we could try to repair the misfit by taking @xmath40 to be the largest of the intervals in the @xmath66th generation , but this may produce overlapping intervals , @xmath67 , which is intolerable .",
    "we explain in the next section how``convergence problems '' arise in the analysis of empirical data whenever arbitrary ( rather than efficient ) partitions are used .",
    "the motivation for the expectation that an _ optimal _ partition may exist , at least in _ some _ cases , is as follows : certain nonintegrable dynamical systems coarsegrain phase space uniquely ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in those systems the optimal partition is generated by the dynamics and is called the `` generating partition '' . as a simple example , the invariant set of the ternary tent map is the middle thirds cantor set ( @xcite ) .",
    "the generating partition of the ternary tent map ( obtained by @xmath66 backward iterations of the unit interval using that map ) is given by @xmath41 intervals @xmath68 , for @xmath69 .",
    "it is impossible to construct a more efficient coarsegraining of the middle thirds cantor set than this one .",
    "the voids are the excluded open intervals @xmath70 , and so on ( initial conditions of the ternary tent map that lie in the voids iterate to minus infinity ) .",
    "we restrict our considerations in this section to relatively uniform clustering ( the clusters in a generation @xmath66 of coarsegraining are all of about the same size @xmath40 , and the @xmath66th generation voids are also all of about the same size @xmath71 ) .",
    "invariant quantities ( scaling exponents ) can only be constructed , if at all , from @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the generation @xmath66 of coarsegraining is increased , as we look at the data set with finer and finer , but _ never _ with _ pointwise _ resolution ( the smallest interval size @xmath48 always contains at least _ two _ data points ) .    in what follows it",
    "is conceptually useful to think of the hierarchy of intervals for @xmath65 as sitting on the branches of a tree of some order @xmath72 .",
    "there are @xmath56 branches in generation 1 , @xmath58 in generation 2 , and so on , and the tree need not be complete .",
    "scale invariance will be seen below to require that @xmath39 increases exponentially , @xmath73 , as @xmath40 decreases exponentially , @xmath74 .",
    "complete trees have @xmath75 branches in generation @xmath66 with @xmath76 an integer , while incomplete ones have noninteger @xmath72 , in which case the order of the tree is the next integer larger than @xmath72 .",
    "the middle thirds cantor set , an idealized model of uniform clustering exhibiting big voids on all scales , defines a complete binary tree ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we are only treating coarsegrained versions of @xmath35 points , so the simplest kind of scale invariance is geometric ( and so is the more complicated kind , as we shall see in parts [ sect : multi_optimal ] and [ sect : multi_empirical ] below ) . a fine - grained picture of the subset of any branch for @xmath78 looks , upon magnification , like the entire tree .",
    "this kind of scale invariance ( @xcite ) is expressed by the exponent @xmath79 in @xmath80 in other words , @xmath81 is an exponent that reflects self  similarity of a hierarchy of relatively _ uniform _ clusters ( clusters within clusters within  ) .    in order to check whether ( [ eq:1 ] ) holds approximately for a given ( very uniform )",
    "data set it is very useful first to find as efficient a partition as possible .",
    "the practical difference ( emphasizing the famous `` convergence '' problem ) between the use of efficient and inefficient partitions is best illustrated by an idealized example .",
    "as an example of an optimal partition consider a very artificial data set constructed as follows : arbitrarily choose a finite number @xmath35 of points generated by ternary expansions of the form @xmath82 with @xmath83 or 2 ( @xmath84 is excluded ) .",
    "these numbers belong to the middle ",
    "thirds cantor set ( all ternary numbers of this kind define the middle ",
    "thirds cantor set @xcite ) .",

    "rational numbers of the form @xmath94 ( periodic expansions like @xmath95 ) and irrational ones @xmath96 ( where the digit string is nonperiodic ) are also covered by all of the @xmath39 intervals as well , so that the covering provided by those @xmath39 intervals @xmath68 is optimal , generation by generation .",
    "the scaling law ( [ eq:1 ] ) yields @xmath97 .",
    "this example illustrates a `` monofractal '' because the optimal covering is uniform ( all @xmath39 of the optimal intervals in one generation have the same size @xmath40 ) .",
    "in contrast , we can try to estimate @xmath79 by using the uniform nonoptimal covering @xmath42 , a space - filling partition given by @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] for @xmath88 , @xmath100 , [ 1/4,1/2 ] , [ 1/2,3/4]$ ] , and @xmath101 $ ] for @xmath102 , etc .",
    ", that ignores the voids alltogether . here",
    ", with @xmath35 points in the data set @xmath103 must be very large before we can expect to observe scaling with an exponent close to @xmath104 : for @xmath105 points , e.g. , and using @xmath106 then from @xmath107 and 2 one gets @xmath108 , @xmath109 yields @xmath110 , and further attempts to extract @xmath79 are impossible unless the number @xmath35 of data points is increased .",
    "this illustrates why , in practice only relatively efficient partitions are of interest .",
    "we return next to the search for the optimal partition of a typically nonuniform empirical data set of @xmath35 points .      for a typical empirical data set of @xmath35",
    "points the most efficient partition that one can construct will rarely be uniform .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the size of the largest cluster in generation @xmath66 after deleting the largest voids , as in part [ sect : clustering_voids ] .",
    "this may yield an overlapping partition of @xmath39 uniform intervals @xmath40 where @xmath67 , but we can immediately improve upon that coarsegraining : in any generation @xmath66 the @xmath39 intervals so  constructed will ( excepting the largest interval , which determines @xmath40 ) not end on data points but will extend beyond them . to make the covering efficient",
    "simply shrink each interval until it ends on the nearest two points of the cluster that it was intended to cover in the first place .",
    "the result is that the number of intervals is exactly the same as before , but we now have @xmath39 nonuniform intervals obeying both @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in other words , we have minimized the sum @xmath113 while holding @xmath39 fixed .",
    "it is hard to see how a more efficient covering can be found , so for the purpose of this paper we call the hierarchy of intervals , so - constructed , the optimal partition ( see figure [ fig : nonuniform2 ] ) .",
    "our definition of optimal partition is a finite precision realization of an `` optimal '' @xmath114covering ( a @xmath114covering approximates the `` infimum '' ) , as is used in the mathematicians definition of `` hausdorff measure '' ( @xcite ) .",

    "can only be answered empirically , by constructing the optimal partition and checking to see whether ( [ eq:1b ] ) holds over many different generations n with the same exponent @xmath125 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the two  scale cantor set is given exactly in the first generation by @xmath126 .",
