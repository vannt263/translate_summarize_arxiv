    "ongoing research of betelgeuse s ( ) extended chromosphere and dust envelope has recently provided important advances in understanding the dynamics and thermal structure of the atmospheres and winds of evolved stars .",
    "detailed investigations of cool star atmospheres are much more intricate compared to hot stars because of enhanced atomic and molecular opacities and complicated dynamic activity ( pulsation and convection ) , although late - type stars are one of the most important laboratories for stellar atmospheric physics .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of luminous cool stars provides fundamental information about the complex physical mechanisms that cause their exceptionally large mass - loss rates ( @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 ) by which these massive stars continuously replenish the interstellar medium with material that has been processed through nuclear fusion reactions , and from which many structures in circumstellar and interstellar environments originate . unlike the supersonic accelerating winds of hot supergiants , the mass - loss mechanisms that drive the slower winds of cool supergiants like are presently not well understood due to a persistent lack of high - quality ultraviolet spectra that probe the important physical properties of atmospheric regions located between the photosphere and the extended circumstellar dust envelope .",
    "spatially resolved raster scans observed with @xmath1 using a small aperture across betelgeuse s uv disk in hst cycles 7 & 8 reveal subsonic oscillations of the inner chromosphere from radiative transfer fits to the detailed asymmetric profiles of the si  i @xmath82516 resonance emission line ( lobel 2001 , lobel & dupree 2001 ) .",
    "the near - uv spectra show long - term changes of gas movements in the lower chromosphere with pulsations of the deeper -presently unresolved- stellar photosphere .",
    "for the first time , these two - dimensional stis spectra provided direct evidence that @xmath0 ori s inner chromosphere oscillates non - radially , thereby occasionally exhibiting simultaneous up- and down - flows .",
    "recent @xmath1 spectra of betelgeuse have been observed in the fall of 2002 and spring of 2003 for go 9369 in hst cycle 11 ; _ a direct test for dust - driven wind physics_. the program investigates the detailed acceleration mechanisms of wind outflow in the outer atmosphere , the upper chromosphere and inner circumstellar dust envelope ( cde ) , of the nearby red supergiant . using the exceptional capabilities of the stis we observe the near - uv spectrum with @xmath8/@xmath14@xmath8@xmath433,000 between 2275  and 3180  with spatially resolved raster scans across the chromosphere at 0 , 200 , 400 , 600 , & 1000 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) ( visit 1 ) , at 0 & 2000 mas ( visit 2 ) , and at 0 & 3000 mas ( visit 3 ) .",
