    "<S> @xcite draws much attention to the multiple - electron dynamics in the laser - atom interaction . in these experiments the single ionization yields of he in a linearly polarized field </S>",
    "<S> is accurately predicted by the single active electron ( sae ) approximation @xcite , well described by the ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) tunneling theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the case of double ionization is more complicated . in the regime of very high intensities ( @xmath0w/@xmath1 ) where strong double ionization occurs , the double ionization keeps in good agreement with the sequential sae models as that in the lower intensities regime(@xmath2w/@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the double ionization yield deviates seriously from the sequential sae model and shows a great enhancement in a  knee </S>",
    "<S>  regime @xmath3@xmath4w/@xmath5,$ ] where the he@xmath6he@xmath7 yields ratio is close to a constant : 0.002 . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising large yields of the double ionization obviously indicates that the sequential ionization is no longer the dominating process in this regime and the electron - electron correlation has to be taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> both the `` shake - off '' model and the `` recollision '' model are suggested to describe the electron s correlation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of the two nonsequential ionization ( nsi ) mechanisms can completely explain the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> for the `` shake - off '' model , it can not give the reason for the decrease in the double ionization yields as the polarization of the laser field departs from linear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the `` recollision '' model , the returning electrons are known to have a maximum classical kinetic energy of @xmath8 @xmath9 , so one can determine a minimum intensity required for the rescattering electron to have enough energy to excite the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> but the double ionization yields observed in experiments have no such an intensity threshold . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the double ionization process is rather complicated and subtle , both of the two nsi processes and the sequential ionization contribute to the double ionization yields and may dominate in the different regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments on the double ionization of helium are mainly confined in the tunneling regime , i.e. the ratio between the tunneling time of the outer electron and the inverse optical frequency ( keldysh parameter ) is less than 1 . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , the quasistatic model @xcite provides a perfect description for the hydrogen - like atoms in the intense fields and successfully explain the most nonlinear phenomena observed experimentally@xcite . inspired by this success , in this paper we extend to develop a 3d quasistatic model ( a two step process ) to investigate the mechanism of the double ionization of helium by tracing the classical trajectories of the two correlated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the double ionization to the classical collisional trajectories : distinct trajectory configurations corresponding to the  shake - off  and `` recollision '' mechanism contribute to the nonsequential double ionization of helium . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations successfully reproduce the excessive double ionization and the photoelectron spectra observed experimentally in the knee regime </S>",
    "<S> . the intuitionistic pictures of the double ionization will be provided by this model .    as a beginning </S>",
    "<S> , we present the improved two - step quasistatic model adopted in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the first step that the outer electron tunnels free , is treated by the tunneling ionization theory generalized by delone et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the second step , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the two electrons after the first electron tunneled and the electron - electron interaction are described by the classical equations ( in atomic unit ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the laser field .    in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the inner electron of the helium is described by a microcanonical distribution which is widely used in the classical - trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) methods established and developed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ctmc method has been successfully used in studying the interaction of atoms with strong laser fields by numerous authors @xcite , which provides a statistical distribution of all the parameters defining the initial conditions of a trajectory of the electrons in the ground state of a hydrogen - like atom . </S>",
    "<S> then , the initial distribution of the inner electron is @xmath13 where @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the normalization constant ; @xmath16 @xmath17 is the eigenenergy of the inner electron . integrating the above equation , one obtains the momentum distribution @xmath18 in which @xmath19 @xmath20 is the negative energy of the inner electron .    </S>",
    "<S> the spherically symmetric ground - state he@xmath7 is represented by the above microcanonical distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this state is specified by the binding energy of the electron in the target atom and five additional parameters randomly distributed in the following ranges : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath26 is the eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath27 is a parameter of the orbit proportional to time , and @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are euler angles . </S>",
    "<S> a random distribution of these parameters corresponds to equal probability of the inner electron having any phase in its periodic motion . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath31 initial points are chosen and their momentum distribution is compared with eq . </S>",

    "<S> figure 1 shows that they are agreeable .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite and a generalized tunneling formula developed by delone et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in parabolic coordinates , the schrdinger equation for a hydrogen - like atom in a uniform field @xmath26 is written ( in atomic unit ) , @xmath32 in which @xmath33 @xmath17 is the negative ionization potential of the outer electron .    </S>",

    "<S> , the above field parameter @xmath26 relates to the laser field amplitude @xmath38 by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> one must point out , as @xmath40 the turning point will be complex , which determines the threshold value of the field @xmath41 @xmath17    the evolution of the outer electron is traced by launching a set of trajectories with different initial parameters @xmath36 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the initial velocity perpendicular to the polarization of the electric field . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ sch ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial velocity is set to be @xmath46 @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the weight of each trajectory is evaluated by @xcite @xmath48 @xmath49 and where @xmath50 is the tunneling rate in the quasistatic approximation @xcite .    before we go further </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to compare our model with a similar model @xcite describing the double ionization of helium . </S>",
    "<S> first , in our model the initial condition of the inner electron is given by the classical trajectory monte carlo method ( ctmc ) ; second , the coulomb interaction is described by the real coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> these improvements are essential . in the model given in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the inner electron is assumed to be rest at the center . </S>",
    "<S> this initial condition confines the motion of both electrons in the same plane defined by the polarization axis and the direction of the initial transverse momentum . , i.e. , in fact , the calculations in their paper is a 2d system , which may increase the probability of the collisions between the two electrons . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the soften coulomb potential approximation adopted in ref.@xcite makes the inner electrons more easily to be excited and cause an overestimation of the double ionization rate . </S>",
    "<S> our model has been employed to understand the momentum distribution of the recoil ions and shown a good agreement with the experimental records@xcite .    in our calculation , the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are solved in a time interval between @xmath36 and @xmath51 by employing the standard runge - kuta algorithm@xmath52 after ten optical cycles the electric field is switched off using a @xmath53 envelope during three cycles , and during the last two optical cycles the electrons is free from the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> so , the electric field can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the amplitude and frequency of the field respectively and the envelope function @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 the wavelength is @xmath59 @xmath60 , which is so chosen to match the experiment @xcite , and the intensities ranging from @xmath61 @xmath62 to the threshold value @xmath63 @xmath62 .    in our computations , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 or more initial points are randomly distributed in the parameter plane @xmath65 @xmath66 for the outer electron and in the microcanonical distribution for the inner electron . the probability for double ionization and the angular distribution </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained by making statistics on an ensemble of classical trajectories weighed by the ( [ wei1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been tested for numerical convergence by increasing the number of trajectories .    in our treatment </S>",
    "<S> , the behavior of the classical trajectories play an important role and determine the ionization dynamics of the electrons . there are four kinds of typical trajectories . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) shows a simple behavior : after tunneled out , the outer electron will be driven mainly by the field and directly run away . </S>",
    "<S> it collides neither with core nor with the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) gives a more complicated picture in which multiple returns and long - time trapping is experienced by the outer electron : the outer electron first tunneled out , and then oscillate in the combined laser and coulomb fields . </S>",
    "<S> after several optical periods , it collides with the core and then absorb enough energy to escape . in the above two cases , no double ionization occurs since the collision between the two electrons is slight . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) and 2(d ) give the typical pictures of the double ionization process . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , the outer electron is born at the regime close to the peak of the electric field , then it oscillates in the combined laser and coulomb fields . </S>",
    "<S> after several optical periods , it returns back to the neighborhood of the core and collides strongly with the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> this collision provide enough energy for the inner bounded electron to get free . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) shows that after the outer electron is tunneled , the laser field will reverse its direction within less than a quarter of the optical periods , so that this electron will be driven back when the laser field reverses its direction and collides with the inner electron near the core and make it ionized . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show later , the resulting energy spectra and the angular distribution of the photoelectrons for the two processes are quite distinct .    </S>",
    "<S> to match the experiments , figure 3 shows the double ionization yields of helium calculated by making use of our model at 13 different intensities in the range @xmath67 @xmath68 the dashed line is the single - ionization yields of he predicted by the adk tunneling rate @xcite , and the solid line is the adk tunneling rate for he@xmath7 . for peak intensities below @xmath69 @xmath62 , one sees that the double ionization rate obtained from our numerical simulations is larger than the adk tunneling rate , but for the intensities above @xmath69 @xmath62 , the adk tunneling rate increases rapidly and becomes larger than the ionization rate given by our model . </S>",
    "<S> this figure reads that our calculation is able to reproduce , qualitatively at least , the excessive double ionization observed in helium experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in figure 3 shows the double ionization rate calculated by our model normalized to the adk tunneling rate of he versus the intensity . </S>",
    "<S> our result is in good agreement with the data in the knee regime observed in experiments @xcite : he@xmath6he@xmath7 ratio in the knee regime is nearly around @xmath70 . at lower intensities </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 the deviation between our calculation and the experimental records becomes serious . in conclusions </S>",
    "<S> , our model provides a suitable description for the double ionization in the knee regime , where as shown above the classical collisional trajectories ( fig.2c , d ) are believed to be the main source of the double ionization . above this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling ionization of the inner electron will become a dominating process and the adk description is available . </S>",
    "<S> below this regime , the ionization mechanism of the outer electron transits from tunneling regime to the multiphoton regime and the tunneling description is no longer available .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the relations between the ionization rate and the phase of the laser field when the outer electron tunneled . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the most double ionization yields come from the region @xmath72 close to the peak of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> there is a tail for the regime @xmath73 and a cut off for the @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we know that when the outer electron tunneled out near the peak of the laser field , its canonical momentum is almost zero . hence , the outer electron tends to oscillate in the combined laser and coulomb fields for several optical periods , and then return back to the neighborhood of the core to collide with the inner electron . in this case , the typical trajectory of the double ionization process corresponds to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . for phase @xmath74 , </S>",
    "<S> the tunneled electrons have a nonzero canonical momentum directing outwards from the core . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it will be driven by the laser field and run away directly from the core . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in this process , the outer electron has no chance to return to the core and no double ionization occurs in the region . for phase @xmath75 , the outer tunneled electron has a nonzero canonical momentum towards the core , and soon after it tunneled out the laser field also reverses its own direction to the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> so the electron will be driven back to the core by the external field and collide with the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> the fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) shows the typical trajectory for this case . in this region </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel ionization of the outer electron is not efficient , and the double ionization rate is low . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the two typical processes of the double ionization , one can find some intrinsic difference . </S>",
    "<S> in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) the outer electron was firstly ionized out , then driven by the field to collide with the inner electron and cause the double ionization , which shows a typical picture of the ` recollision ' process . in the fig.2(d ) </S>",
    "<S> the inner electron was ionized during the process when the outer electron was driven away from core by the external field , both electrons ionize simultaneously which possesses the properties of the ` shake - off ' mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the two processes manifests clearly in the energy evolution of the two electrons . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) , the outer electron is ionized free with a positive energy , then it comes back to collide with the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> this collision causes an sudden increment on the energy of the inner electron which becomes free soon . because the collisions between the two electrons is almost instantaneous so that the energy is conserved approximately when collision happens . in the case of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b),during the escape process of the outer electron it collides with the inner one . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , both electrons are ionized free almost simultaneously . from our calculation we know that both processes contribute to the double ionization in the knee region , but the main contribution comes form the ` recollision ' process which gives more than @xmath76 of the double ionization yields .    from our calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we can also obtain the photoelectron spectra ( pes ) and the photoelectron angular distribution ( pad ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6 shows the total photoelectron energy distribution at @xmath77 @xmath62 and @xmath78 @xmath62 ( both of them are in the knee regime ) calculated from our model . on </S>",
    "<S> can see that , in absolute units , an increasing laser intensity results in the increase of higher energy photoelectrons . </S>",
    "<S> but if one scales the energy units by the pondermotive energy @xmath79 of electron , one will find that the pes for both intensities will show similar shape : the spectrum exhibits a sharply decreasing slope ( region * i * , @xmath80@xmath81 ) followed an extended plateau up to @xmath82 or more ( region * ii)*. this spectrum structure is much close to experimental observations in this regime@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we know that in our model the electron is initiated in the phase interval @xmath83,$ ] so the total photoelectron angular distribution ( pad ) has to consider the contribution of electrons originated in @xmath84 $ ] which is the mirror image with respect to @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 7(a ) is the total angular distribution of ionized electrons . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that except for a main concentration in the field direction , there exists a long tail decreasing with a power - law dependence @xmath86 which is different from the angular distribution for the pure tunneling nature where it decreases exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is due to the scattering with the core and the interaction between two electrons during the rescattering processions . </S>",
    "<S> figure 7(b ) shows the angular distribution of photoelectrons in the energy region * ii*. the most striking feature of the plots is the existence of a slight slope up to @xmath87 followed by a tail up to @xmath85 . if one compares this result with the angular distribution of the transition region in rescattering processes described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where there is no photoelectrons emitted at angles much larger than @xmath88 it is not difficult to find that the tail structure is due to the electron - electron interaction . because the velocity direction of the inner electron is random when the collision happens , the instantaneous strong interactions can give rise to large emission angle of the photoelectron . </S>",
    "<S> this can be verified in figure 7(c ) , which shows the angular distributions of the inner electron and outer electron in double ionization respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this case corresponds to strong electron - electron interaction and the angular distributions is almost flat and the decreases is slowly when the emission angle increases .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the final energy and angular distribution of the photoelectrons are greatly determined by the scattering processes . the process shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) only provides a relatively low energy for the photoelectron ( region * i ) * and gives small emission angle ( the field direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the process shown in fig 2(b ) , the classical trajectories have complex behavior , and the energy exchange in this process is also complicated . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple returns and long - time trapping can produce high energy electron in this process . </S>",
    "<S> so , this region contributes to the high energy part of pes*. * it is also found that the structures of pes and pad are similar to some extent to the rescattering model of hydrogen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact indicates that the main structures of pes and pad come from the rescattering process of the outer electron with the ion he@xmath7 .    in conclusions </S>",
    "<S> , a quasistatic two step model is used to investigate the double ionization of helium in intense linearly polarized field . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reproduce the excessive double ionization and the photoelectron spectra observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the classical collisional trajectories are the main source of the double ionization in the knee regime and responsible for the unusual angular distribution of the photoelectrons . </S>",
    "<S> two distinguished typical collisional trajectories correspond to the ` recollision ' process and the ` shake - off ' process respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both of the two processes have contribution to the double ionization , but the ` recollision ' gives the main contribution and leads to more than @xmath76 of the double ionization yields . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations based on the classical trajectories provide an intuitionistic picture of the double ionization of helium , and are helpful in understanding the complicated behavior of multi - electrons atoms in intense laser fields , in the way of quantum approach and the future experiments observations .    </S>",
