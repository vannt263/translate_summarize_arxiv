    "observations of distant type ia supernovae imply a presently accelerating universe @xcite . in the standard cosmological model",
    "this is accommodated by introducing `` dark energy '' , a component which interacts with the rest of the universe only gravitationally and has a significantly negative pressure which leads to the acceleration of the universe .    in order to accelerate the universe ,",
    "the dark energy component must have an energy density which decreases ( if at all ) much more slowly than matter density as the universe expands .",
    "current data favor a dark energy density which is almost constant or increasing with time @xcite and exciting results can be expected in the future @xcite .",
    "we label the phase when the dark energy density is increasing with the expansion of the universe as super - acceleration .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a method to probe phenomenological properties of dark energy without any assumptions about the evolution of dark energy density .",
    "we use this method to formulate a test to ascertain if the universe evolved through a super - acceleration phase by combining snia and cmb experiments .",
    "we quote our results in terms of two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are the _ best fit _ constant dark energy equation of state parameters for the snia and cmb experiments respectively .",
    "our method does not rely on the equation of state parameter being constant .",
    "in fact , we do not need to assume anything about the evolution of the dark energy equation of state , or about the value of the matter density parameter .",
    "we will outline our method in the context of the specific example of testing for super - acceleration using snia and cmb experiments .",
    "we will end with a discussion of how our method can be generalized to other questions one might ask about dark energy using snia , cmb and other experiments .",
    "questions of the nature , `` did the dark energy density increase with cosmic expansion ? '' are perhaps easier to answer than some questions previously asked in the literature . and yet they have the potential to revolutionize our thinking about dark energy . we stress that answering such questions does not necessarily require measuring the complete dark energy density evolution ; the key point is that we are asking for less information .    in a nutshell , to apply this method one needs to fit a constant equation of state @xmath2 to each of snia and cmb observations and plot conditional probabilities in the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 plane ( e.g. , fig .  1 ) .",
    "the probabilities are conditional in the sense that they are normalized at each value of @xmath3 .",
    "if the upper contours cross below @xmath4 then super - acceleration has been detected .",
    "we stress that the power to make such robust statements comes from combining different measures ( snia and cmb ) which have complementary dependencies on the dark energy equation of state and matter density .    in section [ theory ]",
    "we start with a discussion of dark energy and define super - acceleration rigorously .",
    "we then outline the general characteristics of models which could describe a super - acceleration phase . given",
    "that dark energy is a total mystery even if it never went through a super - acceleration phase , our point of view is that super - acceleration is a question to be observationally settled .",
    "it is satisfying to note that this will be possible with upcoming experiments .",
    "we explain our evolution - independent method in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "we then proceed to forecast the possibilities with regard to measuring a super - acceleration phase from future missions in section [ sec : forecasts ] .",
    "we end with a discussion of how the method can be generalized .",
    "in this section we will consider dark energy in a general setting ( without reference to a theory of gravity ) and define it in terms of its phenomenological properties .",
    "this will allow us to motivate super - acceleration as a part of phenomenologically viable parameter space .",
    "finally , we will consider some models where a super - acceleration phase might arise .",
    "these models are discussed with an aim to better understand the requirements that super - acceleration imposes .      the pressure of the dark energy ( de ) @xmath5 is parameterized in terms of the equation of state @xmath6 which relates it to the physical energy density @xmath7 as @xmath8 . in terms of @xmath6 the evolution of the de density with scale factor",
    "@xmath9 is @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 , then the de density is actually increasing as the universe expands , which seems counter - intuitive . in the context of a scalar field ( @xmath12 ) with canonical kinetic ( @xmath13 ) and potential ( @xmath14 ) terms , @xmath11 is unphysical .",
    "this is easily seen by rewriting @xmath6 as @xmath15 $ ] which is positive if @xmath14 .",
    "the snia observations provide us with a magnitude  redshift relationship .",
    "if the snia can be standardized as sources with known luminosity , then they measure the luminosity distance @xmath16 in units of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the present expansion rate of the universe . within the context of homogeneous and isotropic universes , we can then write d(z)= _ 0^z dz h(z ) , [ dz ] where @xmath19 is the expansion rate of the universe normalized to unity today and @xmath20 is the redshift .",
    "acceleration refers to the condition @xmath21 .",
    "we can parameterize the expansion rate as h^2(z)=(1+z)^3 . [ hz ]",
    "this is completely general and it does not tie us down to a theory of gravity ( see @xcite for examples of studying cosmology in this spirit ) .",
    "any @xmath22 can be written in terms of @xmath23 as above .",
    "[ hz ] is a phenomenological fit ; we need a theory ( for gravity , dark matter and dark energy ) to interpret @xmath3 and @xmath23 .",
    "we can differentiate eq .",
    "[ hz ] to derive the acceleration of the scale factor .",
    "this yields 2 a / a = -(1 + 3 w_x(z ) ) h^2(z ) + 3 w_x(z ) ( 1+z)^3 _ m . [ addot ] the universe is accelerating if @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "also , for @xmath25 > w_x(0 ) > -1/(1-\\omega_m)$ ] we have @xmath26 but @xmath27",
    ".      we will refer to an expansion phase with @xmath28 as super - acceleration .",
    "super - acceleration implies that the dark energy contribution to the expansion rate is increasing with time and this leads to interesting scenarios for the ultimate fate of the universe @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is possible that the universe could end in a `` big - rip '' , with the time scale for such catastrophic events set by @xmath17 . in order to draw such conclusions ,",
    "the future evolution of @xmath23 must be known .",
    "we are interested in the issue of whether future observations will be able to ascertain that the universe went through a super - acceleration phase .",
    "the main motivation for thinking about super - acceleration is the simple fact about dark energy ",
    "we do nt know what it is .",
    "given our current understanding , even if we know what @xmath23 exactly is , dark energy will still be a mystery .",
    "one of the troubling things about super - acceleration is that it seems to violate causality .",
    "the magnitude of the pressure is larger than the energy density and hence one might expect to transmit information faster than the speed of light . while this is a possibility , it is by no means guaranteed by having @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "@xmath23 determines the global evolution of @xmath7 ; it does not tell us how small local perturbations propagate .",
    "given the repercussions and the unintuitive nature of @xmath28 systems , it is of interest to investigate models which give rise to a super - acceleration measurement .    1 .",
    "one possibility is that the universe is accelerating due to a cosmological constant ( or perhaps some dynamical scalar field ) , but the effective @xmath6 at some epoch goes below -1 because of new physics we are unaware of .",
    "an example of new physics @xcite could be the coupling of photons to axions ( not the qcd axion ) @xcite which has been proposed to explain the dimming of supernovae without the need for an accelerating universe .",
    "a second ( troubling ) possibility is that the effective @xmath6 is less than -1 because of systematic effects .",
    "this is similar to ( 1 ) except it is not new physics but some systematic effect that results in the `` apparent '' super - acceleration .",
    "3 .   @xmath11 is a possibility if one postulates that dark energy is a scalar field with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "one must be careful about instabilities in the theory in this case @xcite .",
    "another class of models appeals to a modification of gravity on scales @xmath30 to obtain @xmath28 . like the other models in this section",
    ", this class of models does not solve the `` why now ? ''",
    "problem since the scale @xmath18 is put in by hand to make sure that gravity is only modified today .",
    "there are severe constraints on modified gravity theories in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the main impetus for considering modified gravity theories is provided by brane - world models wherein it might be possible to get super - acceleration @xcite .",
    "in this section we lay out the method by which future experiments can unambiguously detect a super - acceleration phase , independent of the functional form of @xmath31 .",
    "first we show that if a constant equation of state is fitted to snia observations and a result less than @xmath32 is obtained then either the true equation of state must at some point dip below @xmath32 , or the assumed matter density is incorrect .",
    "we then show the same thing for cmb observations .",
    "finally we show how snia and cmb information together can overcome the need to assume a value for the matter density . throughout",
    "we assume a flat universe .",
    "given a set of snia observations our method uses conventional @xmath33 fitting to obtain the best fitting constant equation of state for each @xmath3 ( see next section ) .",
    "the aim of the following paragraphs is to show the significance of this fitted constant equation of state , given that the actual equation of state is of unknown functional form .    a snia experiment measures the luminosity distance @xmath34 out to a certain set of redshifts . as usual ,",
    "we define : d_e(z)=1 _ 0^z dz , [ dedef ] where @xmath35 $ ] . the subscript @xmath36 in eq .",
    "[ dedef ] explicitly denotes that this is the quantity measured by an experiment .",
    "we are further assuming that the experimental magnitude redshift relation is an unbiased estimator of the actual luminosity distance .",
    "the next step in our method is to fit the distance @xmath37 with a distance @xmath38 which assumes a constant equation - of - state , @xmath39 .",
    "thus @xmath40 is has the same form as @xmath34 but with @xmath41 replaced by @xmath42 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath43 is found by maximizing the likelihood assuming gaussian errors ( appropriate for snap ) for the measured distances .",
    "we give a more rigorous derivation in the following paragraphs , but to gain a qualitative understanding first consider the weighting function approach of saini et .",
    "they showed that to a good approximation a constant fitted equation of state from supernovae observations is simply a weighted average over redshift of the true equation of state , where the weighting function is always positive . from this",
    "it is clear that if the constant fitted equation of state is less than @xmath32 then the true equation of state must also go below @xmath32 for some redshift interval(s ) .",
    "the above is only true if the correct matter density has been assumed .",
    "we now have the task of computing the best - fit @xmath43 for a given @xmath37 at a fixed @xmath3 .",
    "this is found by minimizing the @xmath33 at fixed @xmath3 with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting equation does not have a simple solution .",
    "our aim is to figure out when the best - fit @xmath44 . to achieve this",
    ", we replace @xmath40 in the minimization equation by its a first order taylor expansion in @xmath43 , i.e. , d_f(z,_m , ) d_(z,_m ) + g_(z,_m ) .",
    "[ dfapprox ] @xmath45 is defined the same way as @xmath40 but with @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 is the distance in @xmath48cdm cosmology .",
    "we define @xmath49 and the function @xmath50 . for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the error in the approximation given by eq .",
    "[ dfapprox ] is smaller than 3% for @xmath53 .",
    "we note that saini et .",
    "@xcite have shown that this kind of linear approximation works extremely well even when @xmath43 is not constant ( in which case we need to take a functional derivative with respect to @xmath54 . )",
    "we note three facts .",
    "one , we are only _ approximating the fit _ ( to ascertain whether @xmath44 ) and not making any assumptions about the actual @xmath23 .",
    "two , the error in approximating @xmath40 according to eq .",
    "[ dfapprox ] turns out to be unimportant . at the end of this section ,",
    "we show explicitly that the only effect of this approximation is to make our results ( on detecting super - acceleration ) somewhat conservative .",
    "three , we could just as well use @xmath55 as our _ exact _ fit and it would not change any of our arguments .",
    "we chose not to go this route because the above fit is unintuitive and has unphysical behavior for large @xmath43 .    applying the approximation in eq .",
    "[ dfapprox ] to the equation resulting from the minimization procedure , we get the following implicit equation for the best - fit @xmath43 : = . [ dw ] both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are negative for all @xmath58 .",
    "what eq . [ dw ] says is that if the best fit @xmath59 , then @xmath60 for a finite number of @xmath61 or @xmath3 is wrong .",
    "this in turn implies that if @xmath62 is the true value , then @xmath23 must be less than -1 for some redshift range .",
    "a point of note here is that for each @xmath3 we have a corresponding best - fit @xmath63 .",
    "we are not minimizing with respect to both @xmath3 and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath3 resulting from a joint minimization need not be the true matter density and in fact it could be that the best - fit @xmath64 even though the underlying @xmath23 never enters a super - acceleration phase @xcite .",
    "how are our results affected by the small error in approximating the fit luminosity distance @xmath40 by a first order taylor expansion ? to answer this question",
    "let us write @xmath65 for the interesting parameter space , @xmath66 is smaller than about 0.03 . further , for all practical purposes , this approximation overestimates @xmath40 .",
    "one can then show that the effect of this is to make @xmath43 smaller .",
    "thus the conclusions drawn from eq .",
    "[ dw ] are conservative in the sense that @xmath43 is more negative than what we would find from eq .",
    "[ dw ] .",
    "an interesting exercise is to fit the supernova distances with @xmath67 _ exactly_. we can then run through the same arguments as before and arrive at the same conclusion .",
    "in particular , we computed the new contours with @xmath68 and the quantitative results changed very little as expected .      in the discussion above",
    ", we have assumed that we can measure luminosity distance @xmath69 as a function of redshift from supernovae .",
    "however in practice we can only measure magnitudes @xmath70 @xmath71 where the calibration factor @xmath72 is unknown unless we have a very large number of low redshift supernovae .",
    "we expect a few hundred supernovae from snfactory @xcite and the low redshift carnegie supernova program @xcite and that will enable calibration of the luminosity distances to around 0.5 per cent .",
    "if the @xmath736000 supernovae that should be seen by gaia @xcite were all followed up then this could reduce the uncertainty to 0.2 per cent .",
    "this additional uncertainty will reduce our ability to determine if super - acceleration occurred .",
    "we take the conservative ( and not fully optimized ) approach of assuming the worst possible value for the calibration parameter and feeding it through the analysis described above . if the luminosity distance calibration were actually a factor of 1.015 ( 3@xmath740.5 per cent ) higher than estimated from the low redshift sample , then the supernova contours would shift from the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ calibfaff ] to the dotted lines .",
    "this factor corresponds to the true calibration factor being about three @xmath75 away from that estimated by the upcoming experiments .",
    "if there were significantly more supernovae followed up , then this would improve the picture .",
    "for example , we get the dashed contour with a factor of 1.006 .",
    "the cmb is sensitive to the dark energy mainly through its effect on the angular diameter distance to the cmb , and therefore the positions of the acoustic peaks @xcite .",
    "it also has an effect on the largest scales since dark energy changes the integrated sachs wolfe effect , through both the change in the expansion rate and clustering .",
    "here we propose to ignore the cmb information on large scales so that there is no need to make assumptions about the clustering of dark energy .    in the case of the cmb , the approximation given in eq .",
    "[ dfapprox ] does not work well .",
    "however we do not need the approximation since the cmb measures the angular diameter distance out to just one redshift , that of the last scattering surface . the equation to solve for",
    "the cmb is @xmath76 ( neglecting the small error on @xmath34 ) .",
    "although the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath37 is non - trivial here , the argument is simple . for the true @xmath62",
    "if the relation @xmath77 implies that @xmath78 then a super - acceleration phase must happen over a finite range of redshift .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that @xmath79 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath43 .",
    "qualitatively , when a constant equation of state is fitted to cmb data it measures roughly a weighted average of the true @xmath23 where the weighting function is always positive @xcite .",
    "therefore if the fitted @xmath1 gives a value less than @xmath32 then the true equation of state must itself dip below @xmath32 .",
    "as for the sn1a argument , this is only true if the value of @xmath62 has been guessed correctly .      as discussed above , using snia alone it is not possible to uncover the nature of dark energy simultaneously with estimating the matter content @xmath3 .",
    "this is also true for cmb data alone .",
    "therefore we need to combine information from snia and cmb . given observed data we can determine the limits on @xmath2 at each @xmath62 for both snia and cmb and plot this conditional likelihood in the @xmath2@xmath62 plane",
    ". in general the best - fit @xmath2 at some @xmath62 derived from snia will be different from that derived from cmb since they probe the equation of state at different redshifts .",
    "for illustration we use contours which encapsulate 68% of the likelihood throughout , however the method can be carried out for whatever confidence level is required .",
    "the key point of our argument is that if , for every value of @xmath62 , the contour for either @xmath1 or @xmath0 falls below -1 , then it must be that dark energy went through a phase of super - acceleration for a finite period of time .",
    "we explain how this follows from the previous sections by discussing two examples .",
    "consider the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : weffom_sncmb_wminus1 ] .",
    "suppose that we do not know the true value of @xmath62 .",
    "we get around this problem by considering each possible value for @xmath62 in turn .",
    "for each @xmath62 value we assess whether , if this were indeed the true value of @xmath62 , we would conclude that the universe underwent super - acceleration . if for all values of @xmath62 we reach the same conclusion , then we can give a definitive answer , independent of the value of @xmath62 .",
    "as an example let us first consider the value @xmath80 . in this case",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "if this were the true value of @xmath62 then we would have to conclude that at some point in the history of the universe , @xmath83 .",
    "( in fact since the cmb probes the value of @xmath31 at higher redshifts than snia then this would imply that @xmath84 was once less than @xmath32 and has since risen above @xmath32 , but these details are not important for our argument . )",
    "we would reach this same conclusion for all matter densities with @xmath85 . now consider the value @xmath86 .",
    "if this were the true value of @xmath62 then we would again conclude that for some redshifts @xmath83 , since @xmath87 .",
    "we would reach the same conclusion for @xmath88 . however , for @xmath89 then _ both _",
    "data sets allow @xmath90 , therefore we can not be sure whether or not there was super - acceleration .",
    "our conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig : weffom_sncmb_wminus1 ] is that either @xmath91 or there was super - acceleration .",
    "now consider future observations providing the solid ( snia ) and dashed ( cmb ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfiddle ] . running through the same arguments as above ,",
    "we conclude that , no matter what the value of @xmath62 , there must have been super - acceleration .",
    "this can be seen at a glance by the fact that the upper contours cross below @xmath32 .",
    "the method we have just outlined determines if the universe underwent a super - acceleration phase without any assumptions about the evolution of dark energy density .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that one can not test for a super - acceleration phase if the deviation from @xmath92 is arbitrarily tiny .",
    "how well can we do with future experiments ?",
    "we turn to this question next .",
    "in order to make a prediction about how well future experiments will do , we need to generate mock data ( @xmath34 ) which in turn requires that we make some assumptions about the evolution of @xmath23 .",
    "this is not a major hurdle ( as we show later ) , mostly because we interested in getting a rough sense of what future experiments can achieve . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the procedure used to generate mock data assuming a particular @xmath23 function .",
    "we generate data relevant for snap - like and planck experiments .",
    "we assume that the luminosity distance will be measured to an accuracy of 1.4 per cent in each of 50 redshift bins evenly spaced between redshift 0.1 and 2 .",
    "first we simulate data from a model with @xmath93 and @xmath89 .    on fitting the two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath62 we obtain a tight constraint on the two parameters indicated by the shading in fig .",
    "[ fig : weffom_sncmb_wminus1 ] .    for our method",
    "the quantity of interest is not the two - dimensional probability ( as shown by the shaded contour ) but the confidence limits on @xmath0 calculated for a given @xmath62 .",
    "these limits are shown by the solid lines on fig .",
    "[ fig : weffom_sncmb_wminus1 ] and as expected the contours extend to @xmath94 in the direction of increasing @xmath62 .",
    "we generate cmb temperature anisotropy ( tt ) data using the parameters for the planck hfi 353 ghz channel : sensitivity @xmath95 , solid angle per pixel @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the number of pixels on the sky ) and 5 arcmin fwhm beam and assume 100 per cent of the sky can be used . to speed up the computation we bin the observations with @xmath98 and",
    "go up to @xmath99 .",
    "we also marginalize over the hubble constant , the baryon content , and the amplitude and spectral index of the primordial scalar fluctuations .",
    "we ignore tensor modes and do not use cmb polarization information , although in principle these could both be included in the analysis .",
    "the cmb data essentially constrain the angular diameter distance to last scattering @xmath100 and therefore there is a perfect degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath62 . including the large scale isw effect ( the decay of gravitational potential due to dark energy domination ) or lensing on small scales would break this degeneracy to some extent .",
    "however , a reliable estimation of the degeneracy breaking would require some assumptions about the clustering of dark energy .",
    "in light of the uncertain nature of the models of dark energy with @xmath28 , we have decided to not use the lensing signal or the @xmath101 power spectrum ( where the isw effect is important ) .",
