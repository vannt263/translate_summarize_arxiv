    "the existence of a link between agn and starbursts / ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) in the local universe has been discussed for a long time ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence for such a link comes from the tight correlation between nuclear black hole mass and bulge mass ( e.g @xcite ) and the black hole mass - host galaxy velocity dispersion ( m-@xmath2 ) relation in local galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , which suggest that star - formation and accretion onto black holes in galaxies are intimately connected .",
    "however , hst imaging of the host galaxies of luminous quasars to moderate depths showed that most of them have the morphology of elliptical galaxies , with little evidence for ongoing star formation @xcite . at low redshift",
    "only 30% of the host galaxies show obvious signs of disturbance @xcite . although quasars with infrared excesses are thought to host starbursts @xcite , these are a small minority of the optically - selected quasar population .",
    "recent surveys have shown that optically - selected quasars comprise less than half of the total quasar population @xcite .",
    "optical quasar surveys tend to miss dust - reddened quasars which have been found either with infrared surveys @xcite , radio surveys @xcite , hard x - ray surveys @xcite or surveys for high - ionization narrow - line objects @xcite .",
    "therefore they represent a new and largely uninvestigated quasar population , which may have many members that are at an earlier stage in their quasar activity in which dust and gas debris from the merger block the view of the central agn . this fits with population synthesis models of the x - ray background which predict that a large fraction ( close to 80% ) of the accretion process in agn is obscured and only the most energetic photons ( @xmath3 20 kev ) can penetrate the obscuring dust barrier @xcite ) .",
    "dusty quasars are generally divided into type-2 quasars , which show only narrow - line emission in the rest - frame optical , and have inferred extinctions towards the nucleus of @xmath4 , and lightly dust - reddened type-1 quasars , which still show broad lines and quasar continua in the optical , but have significant reddening relative to a normal quasars ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "surveys in the mid - infrared have been able to make approximate census of the obscured quasar population . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that the fraction of lightly dust - reddened type-1 quasars is between 20 and 30% of the total type-1 population .",
    "@xcite also shows that the type-1 population ( unreddened plus lightly reddened ) is about 50% of the total quasar population , the remainder being type-2s .",
    "the nature of both populations remains uncertain . at present , there are two competing models to explain the obscuration in dusty quasars : orientation vs. evolution . in the orientation model ,",
    "dust reddened quasars are observed side - on to a disk or torus of obscuring material ( e.g.@xcite ) , whereas in the evolution model , dusty quasars are viewed as an early stage in the life of a quasar , where the nucleus is obscured by debris from a merger and starburst which triggers the nuclear activity , prior to quasar winds expelling the dust ( e.g. @xcite ) . of particular interest",
    "are the class of lightly reddened quasars , where the reddening is smaller than that expected from a torus seen edge - on .",
    "these objects are good candidates for reddening by dust in the host galaxy , but may also correspond to objects in which the line of sight grazes the edge of the torus .",
    "recent simulations of galaxy mergers tend to support the evolution model , and suggest that the active nucleus is obscured for a long time before the feedback from the accretion disperses the obscuring material @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the quasar is seen in the optical regime only at the end of its lifetime , when it is the most luminous , radiating close to the eddington limit and therefore being capable of expelling the dust @xcite .",
    "a large population of these young , obscured , underluminous quasars would also account for the mostly hard x - ray background ; however there is still debate on the normalization factor of the hard x - ray background , that is the fraction of these sources is still unknown .",
    "observations of type-2 quasars discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , however , tend to support the orientation hypothesis , with broad lines seen in polarized light , and host galaxies consistent with those of normal type-1 quasars @xcite .",
    "similarly , an hst study of lightly - reddened type-1 quasars selected from 2mass found no significant difference in the properties of host galaxies of infrared selected quasars from quasars selected from other methods @xcite , though ground - based studies of a similar samplefound more signs of interactions @xcite .",

    "the primary objective is to study the host galaxies of red quasars and to assess if their morphologies show signs of recent interactions .",
    "we adopt a flat universe , @xmath9 = 70 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 = 0.7 cosmology .",
    "we have selected a sample of luminous , dust - reddened quasars using a combination of 2mass infrared survey @xcite and the first radio survey @xcite in order to answer some of the questions posed above .",
    "the bulk of these dust - reddened type-1 quasars have reddenings around @xmath12 1.5 , which makes them much more heavily reddened than other red quasar samples @xcite , but they do not show the amount of obscuration as true type-2 quasars .",
    "the methodology and preliminary results of this sample are described in @xcite and the final results in @xcite .",
    "we have used two different color selection techniques , both of which seem to be highly effective at finding red quasars ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; or @xmath15 ) .",
    "we have followed up our candidates with keck ( esi ) and irtf ( spex ) to obtain spectra in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "some of these objects show only narrow lines in the observed - frame optical , but spectroscopy of the quasars in the near - ir have show very broad h@xmath16 or paschen lines .",
    "so far , about 100 red quasars have been found with this method , which would have been missed by traditional optical quasar surveys @xcite .",
    "following their conventions , objects from the first-2mass red quasars survey are named f2 m .",
    "in contrast to the 2mass quasar sample of @xcite , which were mostly low redshift , low luminosity and selected by their near - infrared colors alone , the red quasars in our first/2mass study have a median redshift of 0.7 .",
    "we therefore expect the f2 m sample to have have higher luminosity and perhaps more star - formation in the host galaxies than other red quasar samples at lower redshift .",
    "while the selection of red quasars based on @xmath17 colors could include objects which are red due to galaxy starlight in the infrared , the objects in this sample are intrinsic high luminosity quasars , in which the galaxy light should add a negligible contribution in the k - band .",
    "this becomes evident when we measure the reddening of the quasars .      from the f2 m sample , we chose a subsample of 13 0.4 @xmath18 z @xmath18 1.0 red quasars to image to inspect their host galaxy properties . in this section",
    "we will describe their optical spectra , taken mostly with esi on keck .",
    "we fit the optical red quasar spectra to a model of an unreddened quasar . for",
    "that we use the fbqs composite spectrum @xcite with a smc dust reddening law from @xcite using the relation .",
    "@xmath19    with @xmath20 the composite ( fbqs ) and @xmath21 the observed spectrum .",
    "typically the smc extinction curve @xmath22 lacks a significant 2175  bump seen in galactic dust .",
    "we follow the conventions from @xcite to obtain the extinction curve @xmath22 , with @xmath23 ( galactic value ) .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows the spectra of our quasars .",
    "the black line is the observed spectrum , the blue line is the fbqs composite redshifted and normalized to the quasar flux and the red line is the fbqs composite with the deduced reddening correction applied .",
    "the derived @xmath24 are shown in table [ prop ] ; the values have such high errors in @xmath24 either because there was low signal to noise in the spectrum or the rms of the fit was not very good . because there can be significant host galaxy contribution to the optical spectra , especially in the uv",
    ", our @xmath24 estimates can serve as a lower limit .",
    "@xcite also includes the near - infrared spex spectra to their fitting , so in some cases there is some discrepancy between their quoted values and ours .",
    "their deduction of the reddening is beyond the scope of this paper , so we will only take the optical spectrum for an estimate of the reddening of the total system .    for most of the quasars",
    "the reddening fits are consistent with dust - reddening and very little red starlight from the host galaxy is required . however , this is not the case for f2m0825@xmath64716 , f2m0915@xmath62418 and f2m1151@xmath65359 in which the the fit for @xmath24 broke down .",
    "these objects will be important later when we inspect the properties of their host galaxies .",
    "note also that the reddenings are significant enough that the red colors of the quasars could not solely have come from a `` red '' spectral slope .",
    "even though the f2 m sample is radio selected , the radio fluxes of the objects ( table [ prop ] ) are also weak ; the quasars are radio intermediate at best , so a strong synchrotron component showing up in the infrared is unlikely to have much contribution to the red color .",
    "once we have the reddening @xmath24 , we can also derive the intrinsic luminosities of the f2 m quasars from the spectrum ( corrected for obscuration ) .",
    "we also calculated the luminosities of the quasars from the k - band magnitude assuming that in the k - band there is no host galaxy contribution .",
    "the range between the absolute magnitude derived from the spectrum and from the k - band magnitude sometimes is quite large implying that there either were some large slit losses or that even in the k - band there is significant host galaxy contribution , see table [ prop ] .",
    "we are more inclined to use the derived luminosity from the k - band , since the slit will miss the obscured agn often and as mentioned before , the @xmath24 values are only a lower limit as there is host galaxy contribution to the spectrum and we do nt have the full wavelength coverage ranging into the mid - infrared to get the true continuum shape .",
    "the fact that the k - band magnitude is so bright implies that the reddenings must be larger .",
    "what we can say is that the quasars are more luminous than usual , having a luminosity range of @xmath023.5 @xmath1 @xmath026.2 derived from the k - band magnitude .",
    "typical quasar luminosity functions at similar redshifts as our sample have only the highest luminosity quasars above @xmath25 ( our mean value ) , with a steepening of the function at around @xmath26 for quasars at a redshift of @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the high values of @xmath28 we find for our quasars suggests that we are missing the majority of this type of objects .",
    "thus , because of the shallowness of the 2mass survey we are only able to probe the tip of the `` red quasar iceberg '' .",
    "we followed up this subsample of 13 f2 m red quasars with the acs wide field camera on hst ( go-10412 ) .",
    "they were imaged with the f475w and the f814w filters , which roughly correspond to @xmath29 and @xmath30 filters .",
    "the redshift range was chosen such that all our objects had their intrinsic luminosities well above the quasar / seyfert divide ( so that the near - ir magnitudes used in their selection would not have much contribution from the host galaxies ) , and all were at low enough redshift that emission above rest - frame 4000  fell within the bandpass of the f814w filter on acs .",
    "the observing dates and corresponding exposure times are presented in table [ observe ] .",
    "most of the objects were observed for one hst orbit .",
    "however , as the sample of red quasars spanned a significant range of redshift , two high redshift quasars ( @xmath31 ) were observed for two orbits each to ensure a more uniform surface brightness limit for the sample as a whole .",
    "these images were drizzled with the python program _",
    "multidrizzle _ in the usual manner .",
    "for the images with only one orbit we used the readily available drizzled products from the archive , since they did not have significant cosmic ray contamination .",

    "the magnitude of the psf / quasar after fitting is found in the first two columns of table [ psf ]    the first result we can derive from the psf fitting of the hst images is that the quasars are actually more obscured than deduced from the spectrum . in the hst @xmath29-band , which corresponds to rest - frame uv",

    "we then calculated the reddening for only the quasar by reddening the slope of the fbqs composite ( accounting for emission lines that might have fallen within the passbands ) to fit the @xmath29-@xmath30 colors made by the psf using the reddening curve described in section [ sample ] .",
    "most of the objects which already had large @xmath24 reddenings around 1.0 increase their reddenings and colors , while the objects where the reddening of the total system were close to 0.5 on average do nt increase or decrease their reddening .",
    "interestingly , the objects for which the fit of the reddened quasar composite broke down , mostly decrease their reddenings , implying that the host galaxy itself has enough starlight that is responsible for some of the red colors of our objects .",
    "there could also be scattering of the nuclear light into the host galaxy itself , but we assume that the deduced psf magnitude is the total quasar magnitude , since we ca nt assess the amount of scattering from the optical data alone .",
    "figure [ giebv ] shows the shifts of the objects colors and reddenings .",
    "the total magnitudes and reddenings are represented by the filled circles and the stars represent the quasar / psf .",
    "two of the quasars ( f2m0841@xmath63604 and f2m1656@xmath63821 ) were not resolved in the sdss , so the psf magnitudes are much fainter than implied by sdss .",
    "we mark this objects in figure [ giebv ] in green color , their shifts are likely to be wrong , but we include them in the figure for completeness .    from the @xmath29-@xmath30 colors , magnitudes and reddenings , we can then calculate the true luminosity for the quasar , since the absolute magnitudes calculated in section [ sample ] from the spectrum had contamination from the host galaxy , especially in the bluer passband .",
    "table [ psf ] gives the new luminosities ( corrected for reddening ) determined from the quasar colors and magnitudes .",
    "the quasars are a bit more luminous on average , due to the fact that the quasar is more obscured than had been deduced from the spectrum .",
    "the quasars on average are still well above the quasar / seyfert divide and much more luminous than the red quasar study conducted by @xcite , so our claim that we are missing a large population of obscured agn is still valid .",

    "we did this by constraining the scaled psf subtraction so that the residual was approximately flat in the center of the quasar host within a 3 pixel radius and declined monotonically outside that radius .",
    "we also obtained the lower limit of the host galaxy magnitude by subtracting the psf until the central pixel was zero .",
    "the `` mono '' and `` zero '' magnitude are found in table [ galaxy ] .",
    "the host galaxies were modeled by fitting psf plus galaxy model profiles ( convolved by the psf ) by minimizing @xmath34 .",
    "close to the center of the source , systematic errors from the psf subtraction dominate , so to prevent those errors to dominate the fit , the inner 3 pixel radius was downweighted by a factor of 0.5 to ensure that the @xmath34 surface was fairly uniform across the fitting aperture .",
    "the position of the psf and the galaxy nucleus was not held fixed ; so in total we fit the flux , angle , axial ratio and position of the host galaxy to the image .",
    "we tried to fit both elliptical and exponential profiles to the images , however in all , but one case ( f2m1118@xmath00033 ) , the elliptical profile was best , so all our quoted values are for an elliptical profile .",
    "figure [ subtraction ] shows the fitted elliptical galaxy and the residuals after psf and model - galaxy subtraction in the third and fourth panels respectively . note that none of the galaxies are a perfect fit to an elliptical",
    ", however , there were some which came quite close , like f2m0915@xmath62418 .",
    "also , two of the host galaxies , while they did not fit the elliptical profile well , did not show signs for interaction ( f2m0834@xmath63506 and f2m1151@xmath65359 ) .",
    "the fraction of 11 out of 13 systems showing interaction is much higher than the 2mass red agn fraction of one third @xcite and other unobscured quasar host galaxy studies .",
    "the fifth panel in figure [ subtraction ] shows the radial surface brightness profiles for the psf subtracted images and the solid line is the model applied with which they were fitted .    in the following paragraphs , when we discuss the host galaxies we mean the psf - subtracted images and not the modeled host galaxies , to assess their magnitudes , morphologies and comparison the the quasar .",
    "we measured the magnitudes of the host galaxies with sextractor following the conventions above .",
    "the isophotal - magnitudes are quoted in table [ galaxy ] .",
    "they were calculated in the same way the magnitudes were calculated in section [ acs ] .",
    "note that in the cases where the total magnitude of the host galaxy is fainter than the limit denoted by the `` zero '' magnitude , the total host magnitude only refers to the central component of the galaxy , as the host galaxies often showed so large interactions that they are broken up and have various components .",
    "the colors of the host galaxies are not particularly blue , so the host galaxies do not show large amounts of unobscured star formation .",
    "however , some of the extended components are blue , indicating the presence of either merger - induced star formation , or light associated with the quasar . this quasar light could be either scattered continuum , or extended line emission .",
    "the lack of a clear ionization cone morphology ( with the possible exception of f2m0830@xmath63759 ) , however , would suggest that most of this blue light is from young stars .",
    "we also measured the nucleus to host ( n / h ) ratios from these magnitudes ( table [ galaxy ] for the @xmath30-band n / h ) .",
    "as discussed in section [ propqso ] , the n / h for the @xmath29-band will be lower , because the quasar is more extinguished and most of the light in that band will come from the host .",
    "overall , the luminosity of the hosts are on average , a little larger than those of the nuclei , such as the sample of ir - excess quasar sample of @xcite .",
    "the relatively low n / h are in sharp contrast to the high n / h ratios of the luminous quasar sample of @xcite , which is tied to the @xcite sample . however the n / h ratios of our quasars are generally higher than the red quasar sample of @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the absolute magnitudes ( @xmath28 ) of the hosts adopting a 1 gyr post starburst model from @xcite for the k - correction . at the typical redshifts of our sample ( z @xmath35 0.7 ) @xmath36 @xcite , so the host galaxies are around or a bit above @xmath37 luminosity .",
    "one measure of the extent of the host galaxy is the petrosian radius @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "very irregular or interacting systems tend to have high petrosian radii , while compact ellipticals have a low @xmath38 .",
    "the petrosian radius is defined when the ratio of he surface brightness at the petrosian radius and the average surface brightness at radii below reach a certain value @xmath39 :    @xmath40    following sdss conventions , we set @xmath41 .",
    "table [ galaxy ] quotes the petrosian radii of our systems . with one exception ( the very compact f2m0729@xmath63336 ) ,",
    "most have petrosian radii around 1-2.5  , which are normal for galaxies at those redshifts . when comparing those numbers to the surface density plots in figure [ subtraction ]",
    ", one can notice that the nucleus ( @xmath42 ) of the host galaxy often has an elliptical profile ; only the most irregular systems such as f2m0841@xmath63604 are irregular at low radii .",
    "mostly , the interaction features only appear well beyond the petrosian radius and usually have low surface brightness .",
    "this could be an indication why many authors conclude that the host galaxies of luminous quasars are fit best mostly by elliptical profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) , but find so few merger remnants .",
    "perhaps with the overpowering agn ( high n / h ratios ) , the low surface brightness features or interaction morphology signatures are lost .",
    "recently , very deep imaging of some of the quasars studied by @xcite , show either low surface brightness tidal tails or other merger remnants in the form of shells @xcite further supporting this point .",
    "the red quasars in this study are quite extinguished , so the host galaxy features are easier to discern .",
    "we tested how the tidal features can disappear in the presence of a bright quasar by adding point sources of different brightness ( 1,3,10 n / h ratios ) to the host galaxy image . when a psf with a n / h ratio of 10 is added , the quasar is so bright that in all cases with exception of f2m0841@xmath63604 the red quasars lose most of their interaction features and the quasar dominates the image ( figure [ nhfig ] ) .",
    "even so , after performing psf subtraction on a n / h=10 quasar+host system , the interactions should reappear .",
    "also the red quasar host galaxies are in an earlier stage of the merger as we will see next .",
    "as we already commented in section [ acs ] the fraction of our red quasars showing interaction in their host galaxies is very high .",
    "furthermore , all of the _ dust _ reddened quasars , that is the quasars where the dust reddening template fit best , show interaction .",
    "e(b - v ) seems to correlate weakly with the amount of interaction ; the more obscured the quasar is , the more disturbed the morphology of the host galaxy is .",
    "we can arrive at these conclusions more or less `` by eye '' , but we support our claims by parameterizing the host galaxy morphology with their gini coefficients and their concentration indices .",

    "it is a measure of the cumulative distribution of a galaxy s pixel values and is a good alternative approach to quantifying the amount of interactions in galaxies .",
    "the gini coefficient is correlated with the concentration index of galaxies for spiral and elliptical galaxies @xcite and anti - correlated with the concentration index for ulirgs and other highly irregular systems @xcite .",
    "a high gini coefficient therefore indicates either a high level of interactions or a highly concentrated elliptical galaxy , while a low gini coefficient indicates either spiral galaxies or low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "we calculated the gini coefficient of the host galaxies of the red quasars by following the conventions in @xcite .",
    "based on the formalism by @xcite , if we sort the pixels @xmath43 s flux into increasing order , the gini coefficient can be calculated by :    @xmath44    however , we took notice of the warning by @xcite and tried to create segmentation maps at the @xmath45 , the flux threshold above which pixels are assigned to the galaxy . for that we cut out galaxy postage stamps cutouts by eye and included only pixels within that cutout that had a surface brightness higher than @xmath45 .",
    "the gini coefficient was then computed of the distribution of _ absolute _ flux values of the pixels which corrects for the areas in the center which were psf - oversubtracted .",
    "the gini coefficients g can be found in table [ galaxy ] .",
    "the concentration index measures the ratio of the flux withing an inner radius to that within and outer circular or elliptical aperture .",

    "while there is a weak correlation between the gini coefficient and the reddening , we find no correlation between the concentration index and @xmath24 .",
    "as mentioned before , high gini coefficient and low concentration indices are an indication for interaction or merger , since the brightest flux pixels are highly concentrated in a few pixels ( high g ) , but those pixels are not in the center ( low c ) .",
    "this seems to be the case in the systems with the highest @xmath24 in our sample , while the hosts of quasars with lower @xmath24 tend to have both gini coefficients and concentration indices more consistent with those of normal , undisturbed galaxies @xcite . on the lower panel of figure [ ginicon ]",

    "if the reddening in the spectrum fits a dust reddening template well , it is also a good indicator for evidence of interaction .",
    "nonetheless , these results are based only on 13 highly heterogenous systems , so further observations are needed to improve number statistics and to confirm this claim .",
    "while most of the quasar host galaxies show some degree of irregularity and evidence for merger , it is worth it to look at the quasars on an individual basis to further inspect some peculiarities in some of the objects .",
    "this is the only quasar for which sdss information was not available .",
    "even though we detected only 6 photons in the x - ray observations , all of them are in the hard band , giving this source a hardness ratio of 1.0 and therefore implying a high column density .",
    "the spectrum has strong ca h+k absorption lines , but the spectral reddening does fit a dust extinction law quite well longward of about 5000  , so the host galaxy contribution to the red optical light in the spectrum is not going to make a large impact .",
    "this particular system has a very compact elliptical host , with a very small petrosian radius and large gini coefficient . beyond that",
    "however , large tidal tails extend out to over 20 kpc on both sides of the host , which is evidence for a recent merger event .",
    "this makes the total size of the host galaxy over 35 kpc . in the @xmath29-band",
    ", the quasar ( psf ) contribution is almost non - detectable , making this the system with the largest shift in @xmath29-@xmath30 color of the psf relative to the total emission from the host .",
    "this looks like a type-2 quasar in the optical spectrum .",
    "the color of the quasar ( psf ) would suggest that also .",
    "however , the spex ir spectrum shows broad quasar lines , however and a much redder spectral slope than implied by the optical continuum , which is probably dominated by host galaxy emission .",
    "the image shows that while the central component is fit well by an elliptical galaxy , there is a tidal bridge linking the central galaxy to a companion nearby .",
    "the optical spectrum shows double - peaked narrow emission lines , separated by about 600km@xmath47 .",
    "the higher redshift set has relatively strong balmer lines and [ oii]3727 emission at @xmath48 , and probably corresponds to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the blueshifted component at @xmath49 is of higher ionization and probably corresponds to a high ionization outflow .",
    "this quasar has the lowest redshift in our sample , therefore features close to the nucleus will be more easily observable .",
    "the hubble image in fact shows a lot of irregularity near the nucleus with shells of material along the major axis , either side of the nucleus .",
    "they almost cancel each other out in the radial profile plot , resulting in a deceptively smooth radial profile , while in reality the host galaxy is very disturbed .",
    "f2m0830@xmath63759 was also observed with chandra and has a very high x - ray flux @xcite . the x - ray spectrum shows a very broad iron k@xmath16 line , hinting that we are looking into the broad line region of the quasar .",
    "it has a moderate absorption , but a higher than usual spectral slope ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is also the only object for which we have a gas : dust ratio , which is about 5 times galactic value . while dusty , it is well within the 3 - 100 times galactic value range deduced by @xcite .",
    "the red quasar system has almost no evidence for interaction .",
    "the profile could fit an addition of elliptical profiles , but the morphology could also represent merger remnant shells . however , there are no extended features or tidal tails .",
    "it is unclear whether the blue component just to the north of the quasar is associated with it , or whether it is an unrelated object close to the line of sight .",
    "there are broad h@xmath16 and h@xmath51 emission lines @xmath355000 km s@xmath10 blueward of the quasar s redshift , which could be associated with that component and/or with the quasar .",
    "this object shows the most irregular morphology in the host galaxy of the hubble images . while the optical image clearly shows two bright nuclei , of which either or both could be the quasar , the radio images ( from first and also 6 cm vla a - array observations ) show a steep spectrum point source right in between the two bright optical components .",
    "this raises the question of where the active nucleus actually is .",
    "in addition to the hst and vla images , f2m0841@xmath63604 has been observed with chandra @xcite .",
    "the chandra photons are very hard .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray image had only 7 counts , so the position error on where the x - ray emission comes from is quite large .",
    "however , the chandra photons appear to be spread out , so the x - ray emission could come from both nuclei .",
    "overall , this is our most spectacular example of a young evolutionary merger state .",
    "f2m0915@xmath62418 is the quasar which fits an elliptical profile best .",
    "however , a clear _ tail _ is seen extending to th east indication a recent interaction .",
    "this red quasar displays two nuclei only 0.15  ( 1.2 kpc ) apart , which would have been missed in ground - based observations .",
    "the two nuclei are point - like and especially easy to detect in the @xmath29-band , but the nucleus appears very `` smeared '' in the @xmath30-band image .",
    "the fitting of quasar and host galaxy is therefore impossible .",
    "the quoted luminosities for the quasar are only for one component , so the total nuclear luminosity is much higher than @xmath52 .",
    "the rest of the host galaxy does not appear very disturbed and also here the central component fits an elliptical profile , were it not for that second nucleus .",
    "there is some blue emission north of the galaxy , but again , we do not know if it is associated with the quasar host .      while the position of the quasar is quite certain , because of the clear stellar - like feature , it is noteworthy that the rest of the host galaxy consists of several bright knots , with a low surface brightness tidal tail extending to 30 - 35 kpc from the galaxy .",
    "the image for this red quasar shows it to be a clear merger with a nucleus and two compact components , one near the nucleus and the other one at the end of the two tidal tails trailing the system .",
    "this is the only system for which an exponential profile fit the host galaxy better than an elliptical ( but only near the nucleus ) .",
    "the optical spectrum for f2m1118@xmath00033 shows a 4000  balmer break , and a red spectral slope which appears to be dominated by the host galaxy .",
    "the infrared spectrum @xcite also fails to show obvious broad emission lines , but does show a significant rise in k - band , probably from quasar light .",
    "f2m1151@xmath65359 is the quasar also fits an elliptical profile quite well , but there is still some residual in the host galaxy after model subtraction in the @xmath30-band .",
    "the blue band fits almost perfectly .",
    "so this would be comparable to other `` normal '' , bright , blue quasars , which have an undisturbed elliptical galaxy as a host .",
    "the spectrum shows asymmetric profiles in the emission lines and narrow mgii absorption lines very close to the quasar redshift .",
    "this is the highest redshift red quasar imaged with acs .",
    "the spectrum fits dust reddening quite well .",
    "also here the central component can be well fit by an elliptical galaxy , but there is a low surface brightness tidal bridge connecting it to the red companion nearby .",
    "f2m1507@xmath63129 is thus a very large ( 35 kpc ) and spectacular merger at z@xmath351 .",
    "hst imaging of f2m1532@xmath62415 displays a truly disturbed host , with many components and no clear evidence of where the quasar is located among the constituents of the host galaxy .",
    "radio maps show the synchrotron radiation coming from the central red component .",
    "they also show that this quasar is actually a classical fanaroff - riley type ii radio double ( frii , @xcite ) , with the outer components being over one arminute away from the central source .",
    "the optical spectrum shows a very narrow h@xmath51 line and no broad mgii line , but in the infrared pa@xmath51 is broad .",
    "the quasar host shows extreme interaction .",
    "this optically - faint object shows almost only host galaxy emission in the optical part of the spectrum , but in the near - infrared there is a very red continuum and a broad pa@xmath51 line .",
    "there are three components in the hst image , two point - like and one elliptical .",
    "the radio flux points to the emission coming from the brightest ( sw ) optical point source .",
    "the morphology of f2m1656@xmath63821 could suggest that the system is a gravitational lens with the lensing galaxy lying between the two point sources .",
    "the reddening for this system might stem from the lensing galaxy and not the quasar itself , as is implied by the host galaxy s very red colors .",
    "however , the lack of any arc - like morphology in the outer optical components and the lack of spectral features at lower redshift in this object s spectrum argues against the lensing hypothesis .",
    "we have observed and analyzed a sample of 13 highly reddened , luminous quasars from the f2 m survey @xcite with acs in both @xmath30- and @xmath29-band to study their host galaxies .",
    "the images show interactions in 85% of the objects and clear evidence for mergers such as tidal tails and multiple nuclei .",
    "we fitted model psf and galaxy profiles to the images . within the nuclear region ,",
    "most galaxies fit an elliptical profile , in accordance with quasar host studies such as @xcite , but outside of the nuclear region this fit is no longer valid as merger features become clear .    after performing psf - fitting",
    ", the quasar displays even redder colors and reddenings than implied from sdss imaging and esi - spectra , showing that the optical magnitudes of the quasars are significantly contaminated by the host galaxies in low resolution data .",
    "five of our galaxies show very dramatic , likely multiple merger morphologies , reminiscent of the simulations of high-@xmath53 quasar hosts by @xcite .",
    "there is a wide range in merger phase , with some of our quasar hosts in an apparently early part of the merger sequence where the merging galaxies still retain their identity ( f2m0841@xmath63604 ) , through to later stages with multiple nuclei ( f2m1113@xmath61244 ; f2m1012@xmath62825 ) , and objects at the final merger stage with only a single nucleus and a tidal tail remaining ( f2m0915@xmath62418 ) .",
    "this would be consistent with quasar activity being triggered relatively early in an interaction , and continuing through the merger process .",
    "we calculated the gini coefficients and the concentration indices of the host galaxies and found a correlation of the gini coefficient with reddening .",
    "the systems with the highest quasar @xmath24 did not have high concentration indices consistent with their high gini coefficients , which implies that the host galaxies have bright , compact components outside of the nuclear region . using this as a measure of interaction",
    ", it seems that the amount of interaction is weakly correlated with how obscured the quasar is .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 17 normal quasar hosts with hst which are closest to our sample in terms of luminosity and redshift .",
    "their sample spanned @xmath54 in quasar luminosity and @xmath55 in redshift .",
    "consistent with previous studies , only a small fraction of interactions / mergers were seen ( they have only one object out of 17 with definite signatures of an interaction ) . however , sensitive observations of the hosts of unreddened quasars of similar luminosity are difficult , so it is possible that some signs of interaction such as faint tidal tails and multiple nuclei close to the quasar will have been missed .",
    "our correlation of reddening with morphology argues against this , but our observed correlation is only weak .",
    "however , figure [ nhfig ] also shows obvious signs of merger even at nucleus to host ratios of 10 .",
    "another possible source of bias is that , while none of the red quasars is radio - loud , these objects are all radio - selected , and fall into the `` radio intermediate '' category .",
    "the fact that all of our quasars are disturbed in comparison to , e.g. , the @xcite sample , could be a selection effect .",
    "@xcite find that quasars with redder colors than the sdss composite tend to have higher radio - fluxes .",
    "these caveats aside , our results may explain why only about 30% of quasars with obvious signs of mergers and interactions have been found @xcite .",
    "reddening by dust from the host galaxy seems to be the most likely explanation for the redness of the f2 m quasars .",
    "the host morphologies and colors are consistent with dusty , merging galaxies . if these objects were red because the line of sight just grazes the torus we would expect less disturbed host morphologies , in line with those of normal quasars .",
    "host galaxy reddening of the quasar , whilst only mild in our cases ( and much less than nuclear reddening by an edge - on torus ) can nevertheless be sufficient to remove the objects from optically - selected quasar samples ( or at best render them a small minority in such a sample ) . given that these kind of dust - reddened type-1 quasars like these make up about 30% of the total in mid - ir selected samples , this means the fraction of quasar hosts associated with mergers has been significantly underestimated in the past .",
    "our result is thus consistent with theories in which quasars start their lives obscured by dust , and only appear in optical or soft x - ray surveys after the dust along the line of sight to the nucleus has been cleared by quasar winds @xcite .",
