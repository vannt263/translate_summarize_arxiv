    "algebraic curves with involutions and related abelian varieties have been objects of throughout study during many decades , mostly in connection with integrable systems in mathematical physics and geometry .",
    "in particular , a non - hyperelliptic genus 3 curve @xmath0 having an involution @xmath3 and covering an elliptic curve @xmath4 appears as a spectral curve of lax representations of many algebraic integrable systems , such as the clebsch integrable case of the kirchoff equations , the frahm  manakov top on the lie algebra @xmath5 , and the kovalevskaya top , as well as their generalizations .    as was shown in @xcite , generic complexified invariant tori of all these systems",
    "are open subsets of 2-dimensional abelian subvarieties of the jacobian of @xmath0 , namely , prym varieties @xmath6 associated with the covering @xmath7 . in",
    "this case @xmath6 has polarization ( 1,2 ) , so it is not the jacobian of a genus 2 curve .",
    "on the other hand , in her celebrated paper @xcite , s. kovalevskaya presented a separation of variables of the corresponding integrable system on a genus 2 ( and , therefore , a hyperelliptic ) curve @xmath8 , whereas the complex flow of the system was linearized on the jacobian of @xmath8 .",
    "for the clebsch integrable case and the frahm  manakov top on @xmath5 , similar complicated linearizations were made by ktter @xcite and , respectively , schottky @xcite .",
    "apparently , the papers @xcite were the first ones where this seeming contradiction had been explicitly explained : the subvariety @xmath6 can be viewed as 2-fold covering of the jacobians of 3 different , i.e. , birationally non - equivalent , genus 2 curves .",
    "in addition , there exist three other different genus 2 curves whose jacobians are 2-fold coverings of @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , for the case of the kovalevskaya top , one of these hyperelliptic curves is equivalent to the original curve of separation found in @xcite .",
    "next , following a remarkable geometric construction of @xcite inspired by @xcite , the papers @xcite presented a specific family @xmath9 , @xmath10 of plane genus 3 curves covering elliptic curves @xmath11 , which gives rise to the same prym variety _ dual _ to @xmath6 arising in the kovalevskaya problem .",
    "then the three genus 2 curves whose jacobians are isogeneous to @xmath6 appear as regulazations of singular curves in the family @xmath9 . in @xcite the coefficients of @xmath9 have been expressed as complicated algebraic functions of parameters ( the weierstrass points ) of the above genus 2 curves .",
    "the covering @xmath7 and the related prym varieties have also been sources of several beautiful geometric constructions related to intersection of quadrics in @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) , which , in turn , has different connections with integrable systems .    in this paper , using the modern results of @xcite and , on the other hand , calculations of the classical paper @xcite , we present a complete solution to the  direct  problem : given an _ almost _ generic genus 3 curve @xmath0 covering an elliptic curve @xmath1 ( equation below ) , to find explicitly weierstrass equations of all the six non - equivalent genus 2 curves @xmath8 whose jacobians are _ degree _ 2 isogeneous to the prym variety @xmath6 ( see theorem [ main_th ] ) .",
    "moreover , it appears that the weierstrass points of these curves are calculated via one and same universal formula , whereas the passage from one curve to another is made by a mere permutation of roots of certain quartic equations associated to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if such a curve @xmath0 appears as the spectral curve of a lax pair of an algebraic integrable system , one can perform explicitly a separation of variables on any of the six curves .",
    "we also consider interesting special cases of the covering @xmath7 : first , when the genus 3 curve @xmath0 is itself hyperelliptic and has 2 commuting involutions ( as occurs in the above mentioned integrable systems when the area integral or its analog equals zero ) ; second , when @xmath0 is not hyperelliptic , but @xmath6 contains 2 elliptic curves and , as a result , the jacobian of @xmath0 is isogeneous ( but not isomorphic ) to a product of 3 different elliptic curves .",
    "( in the latter case the solutions of the corresponding integrable systems can be written in terms of elliptic functions . )    the algebraic description of the jacobians is accompanied by giving the structure of their riemann period matrices @xmath14 and the relations between them .",
    "we observe that some of the period matrices are obtained one from the other one by multiplication by 2 , thus the equations of corresponding genus 2 curves are connected via the algebraic richelot transformation , as described in @xcite , see also @xcite .    in appendices we present a detailed algorithm of explicit calculation of the period matrix of @xmath6 and apply it to a first numerical example in this field : given a covering @xmath2 , we derive the @xmath15 riemann matrices of all the six jacobians , degree 2 isogeneous to @xmath6 .",
    "then we calculate the weierstrass equations of the corresponding genus 2 curves by using the main theorem [ main_th ] and , finally , see that the period matrices of the jacobians and the curves share the same sets of absolute invariants .",
    "this provides an experimental confirmation of the main results of the paper .",
    "the concrete formulas of the absolute invariants of genus 2 curves , both in an algebraic and theta - function form , suitable for calculations , are also presented for the first time .",
    "we now specify the class of curves ( over the field @xmath16 of complex numbers ) and prym varieties we consider in this paper , and start with the following properties .",

    "the involution @xmath30 on the curve @xmath0 extends to its jacobian variety , @xmath31 .",
    "thus the latter contains two abelian subvarieties : the elliptic curve @xmath1 itself and the 2-dimensional prym variety denoted as @xmath32 , which is anti - symmetric with respect to the extended involution , whereas @xmath1 is invariant .",
    "equivalently , @xmath33 , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is not a jacobian variety , in particular just because it does not carry a principal polarization .",

    "according to @xcite , any 2-dimensional abelian variety @xmath41 with polarization ( 1,2 ) can be realized as the prym variety of a covering @xmath2 described in theorem [ gen_cover ] .",

    "we stress that , given a generic elliptic curve @xmath1 and a divisor @xmath53 on it , not any covering @xmath2 ramified at @xmath28 can be written in the form : this imposes one algebraic condition on the coefficients of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely , the coefficients must satisfy a quartic equation which is too long to show here .",
    "if this condition holds , then only one curve @xmath0 of the set @xmath27 is given by equation , whereas the other three curves have the form @xmath56 i.e. , they belong to the general family .",
    "the latter implies that for the covering @xmath2 given by , the corresponding variety @xmath6 can be uniquely reconstructed from the data @xmath57 , whereas in the general case described by theorem [ gen_cover ] , the same data are not sufficient for this purpose , as they lead to four different covering @xmath2 and 4 non - isogeneous pryms .",
