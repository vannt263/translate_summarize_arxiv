    "in this paper , we consider the asymptotic behaviour of an affine scalar stochastic functional differential equation where the average of the process over its entire history appears on the right  hand side .",

    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are real parameters .",
    "there is a unique strong solution of which is a gaussian process .",
    "the goal of the paper is to describe for all pairs of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 the asymptotic behaviour of the paths , as well as information about the autocovariance function of @xmath1 in the case that the solution is recurrent on @xmath8 .",
    "this model was studied in @xcite , where the authors considered the case @xmath9 . under this condition",
    "the solution @xmath1 was shown to grow at a well  defined exponential rate , with a polynomial correction .",
    "specifically , the rate of growth is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an almost surely finite and gaussian distributed random variable .",
    "the results in @xcite rely on the theory of admissibility of linear deterministic volterra operators .    while the present article establishes some new results concerning the case when",
    "@xmath9 , for the most part it is concerned with the case when @xmath12 , where the solution need not have a well - defined growth rate but rather may fluctuate .",
    "this behaviour is not wholly unexpected ; in the case when @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for example , the solution of is an asymptotically stationary ornstein  uhlenbeck process , while when @xmath15 and @xmath14 , it is a scaled standard brownian motion .    a complete asymptotic dynamical picture of the solution @xmath1 is determined for all real values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the paper .",
    "our analysis shows that there are only three principal regions in the ` @xmath16 ' parameter space , within which the process @xmath1 undergoes different pathwise asymptotic behaviour .",
    "for clarity we provide a bifurcation diagram of the parameter space :    * in theorem  [ thm.averagegaussian ] , corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath17 , the solution @xmath1 is asymptotically equal to an ornstein  uhlenbeck process and has oscillations of magnitude described by @xmath18 * in theorem  [ cor : stochexp ] , corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath19 , the solution @xmath1 tends to plus or minus infinity at a polynomial rate @xmath20 where @xmath11 is an almost surely finite proper random variable . * in theorem  [ thm.bubbleaveexp ] , corresponding to @xmath9 , the solution @xmath1 is shown to obey * in theorem  [ thm : modbes ] , corresponding to @xmath15 and @xmath21 , the solution grows at a rate which is faster than the polynomial growth of yet slower than the exponential growth given by . * in theorem",
    "[ thm : bes ] , corresponding to @xmath15 and @xmath22 , the solution @xmath1 is recurrent on @xmath8 and its largest fluctuations are described by a result reminiscent of the law of the iterated logarithm .    in analysing the solution of the stochastic equation it is helpful first to ask how the underlying deterministic equation behaves asymptotically .",
    "this deterministic equation is attained from by letting @xmath23 .",
    "the solution of this underlying equation ( which corresponds to the mean of @xmath1 ) may be expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric , modified bessel and bessel functions .",
    "properties of these special functions are well  documented , c.f .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "an associated differential resolvent may also be decomposed in terms of these special functions . in theorems  [ cor :",
    "stochexp ] ,  [ thm.bubbleaveexp ] and [ thm : modbes ] the asymptotic behaviour of the solution @xmath1 may then be shown to mirror that of the deterministic equations , i.e. the asymptotic rates of growth or decay of the solutions of the deterministic equations are preserved under the addition of a stochastic perturbation . however , as theorem  [ thm.averagegaussian ] demonstrates the stochastic perturbation can for particular values of the parameters produce asymptotic behaviour which is distinct from that of the solution of the associated deterministic equation .",
    "the analysis is achieved via this decomposition of the resolvent and a variation of parameters formula .",
    "many of the asymptotic results concern pathwise behaviour .",
    "however , many of the growth results also hold true in mean or in mean square . furthermore ,",
    "in the main case where there are fluctuations ( i.e. , when @xmath13 and @xmath24 ) , we show that the autocovariance function of the process @xmath1 decays at a polynomial rate in time , i.e. for any fixed @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath1 may be viewed as possessing _ long memory _",
    ", in the sense that for any fixed @xmath28 , @xmath29 this result is all the more striking as theorem [ thm.averagegaussian ] proves that @xmath1 is asymptotically equal to a process whose autocovariance function decays exponentially quickly , i.e. a  short memory  process .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that @xmath1 is transiently non  stationary , and has limiting autocovariance function equal to that of the stationary ornstein uhlenbeck process to which it converges pathwise .",
    "we comment more on the this result in the next section .",
    "one of the motivations of this work is to develop a parameterised stochastic functional differential equation whose asymptotic behaviour is completely characterised , as such an equation can act as a test equation for simulation methods for sfdes .",
    "another mathematical motivation is to demonstrate that the general approach of admissibility theory developed in @xcite can generate the same results as the special function theory outlined here ( at least in some cases ) , thus supporting the conjecture that it can prove a sharp tool in studying the asymptotic behaviour of linear , quasilinear or affine stochastic functional differential equation .    however , one of the main interests in examining this equation is to gain insight into some features of price dynamics in inefficient financial markets .",
    "first , we argue that may be considered as a simple model of such a market .",
    "suppose that there is a class of technical analysts who compare the current returns of a risky asset with the average of historical returns .",
    "this leads to an instantaneous excess demand of @xmath30 per unit time at time @xmath28 .",
    "a class of feedback traders compare the returns to a reference level @xmath31 , leading to an instantaneous excess demand of @xmath32 per unit time at time @xmath28 .",
    "unplanned demand by the traders arises from `` news '' , where the news in each period is independent of that in previous periods .",
    "the contribution of this news to overall excess demand is @xmath33 over the time interval @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath4 is a standard one  dimensional brownian motion .",
    "if we presume that returns respond linearly to the excess demand of the market , then @xmath35 obeys the stochastic functional differential equation @xmath36 for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 for @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the price of the risky asset at time @xmath37 is denoted by @xmath40 and defined by @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "now define @xmath43 for @xmath37 and @xmath44 for @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath1 obeys with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "motivation and literature for such models , as well as alternative inefficient market models may be found in  @xcite , in which a market with finite memory is considered . in common with  @xcite , in this work @xmath35 can grow to plus or minus infinity , with both events being possible . in terms of the mathematics , this happens if and only if    * @xmath9 ; * @xmath13 and @xmath19 ; * @xmath15 and @xmath21 .    from an economic perspective",
    ", the first case corresponds to the situation where the feedback traders chase trends ( @xmath47 ) and either dominate the fundamental investors , who have mean  reverting expectations about price movements ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) or both classes of agents have trend chasing type expectations ( @xmath47 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "the other two cases , while interesting mathematically , are less likely within the scope of the model : the second case requires @xmath50 , which implies that fundamental investors are bullish about higher than average returns , but @xmath51 , which indicates these investors dominate the technical traders , who now have mean reverting expectations about returns .",
    "nonetheless , this case serves to demonstrate that if at least one of the investor classes believes that high and rising returns are a signal of higher returns in the future , and that that class of agent dominates , then bubbles are likely outcomes .",
    "the third case occurs if the two classes of traders have equal strength , ( @xmath52 ) , with the technical traders having mean reverting expectations , and the fundamental investors being bullish about higher than average returns ( @xmath53 , @xmath50 ) .    in all these cases ,",
    "the limiting random variable is path dependent , so it follows that the initial behaviour of the market determines whether there is a bubble or a crash .",
    "this picture is consistent with the mechanism proposed for the formation of bubbles with those formed in models of mimetic contagion , first introduced by orlan  @xcite .    from a modelling and time series perspective ,",
    "the behaviour in the  non  bubble  case when @xmath13 and @xmath24 , or @xmath15 and @xmath22 is also of interest .",
    "the former corresponds to the situation where @xmath51 , @xmath54 , in which the fundamental investors have mean reverting expectations , and either dominate the technical investors ( if they have trend chasing expectations ) or the technical traders also have mean reverting expectations themselves . in this case as we observed the size of the largest fluctuations of the process is given by @xmath55 .",
    "thus as the process is actually mean reverting in this scenario it is in the interests of the trend chasing traders to ensure that @xmath56 is as close to zero as possible so that the the process undergoes as large fluctuations as possible .",
    "this phenomenon is observed in financial markets , i.e. when there is a large proportion of uninformed investors in a market then the volatility of the market tends to be higher than in their absence c.f .",
    "e.g. de long et al .",
    "@xcite . if however the uninformed investors where to force @xmath48 then this , as already observed , will result in the formation of an uncontrollable bubble .",
    "the case when @xmath15 and @xmath22 is consistent with solutions obeying the law of the iterated logarithm , and so may be roughly associated with gaussian processes that are non  stationary , but possess stationary increments .",
    "however , in the former case , not only ( as we have already pointed out ) is @xmath1 is asymptotically indistinguishable from an asymptotically stationary process , it can be shown that @xmath1 itself is asymptotically stationary ( or _ transiently non  stationary _ ) , i.e. @xmath57 for some function @xmath58 .",
    "moreover this limiting autocovariance , as a function of @xmath59 , decays exponentially and so is indicative of a short memory process . at the same time , we have already seen that when @xmath28 is fixed and @xmath60 , then @xmath61 tends to zero at a polynomial rate , and is indeed non ",
    "integrable when @xmath21 . in a sense",
    "therefore , the process exhibits `` long  memory '' and `` short  memory '' characteristics . of course , it is not unheard of that reversing the order of these limits leads to different answers , and while this is an interesting mathematical example of this phenomenon , it is otherwise not noteworthy .",
    "however , given that there is considerable debate among empiricists in finance concerning the presence or absence of long memory in certain financial time series , it is interesting to note that this paper presents an asymptotically stationary process in a ( highly simplified , indeed unrealistic ) market model , which also possesses somewhat ambiguous memory properties .      the article is organised as follows . in this section ( section  [ sb : avprelim ] ) , we formally introduce the equation under scrutiny and define some notation .",
    "section  [ sec.specialfn ] gives a detailed description of the decomposition of the solution of the deterministic equation into special functions , and in particular details the differing functions which are used depending on the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in order to make our",
    "presentation self  contained , various properties of these functions which are needed in the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour , are listed .",
    "section  [ sect : rec ] deals with recurrent dynamics of @xmath1 , with subsection  [ sect : recpath ] giving results on the almost sure pathwise asymptotic behaviour of the process , while subsection  [ sect : recauto ] discusses the memory properties when @xmath1 has these recurrent dynamics .",
