    "; currie & dowling 1999 ; smith & gehrz 1998 ) ; and finally the nitrogen - rich , ionized `` outer ejecta '' found outside the homunculus , some of which were ejected during the great eruption , and some of which may be decades to centuries older ( walborn et al .  1978 ; walborn & blanco 1988 ; morse et al .",

    "if enhanced mass loss occurred during a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase that lasted @xmath710@xmath9 yr with @xmath10500 km s@xmath3 , for example , then the products of @xmath0 car s outbursts may potentially be seen 1@xmath11 away or more ( @xmath750 pc ) . before reaching such distances , however , ejecta from @xmath0",
    "car interact with stellar winds and radiation from several of the other luminous early - type stars in the carina nebula ( e.g. , walborn 1973 , 1995 ; feinstein 1995 ) .",
    "this interaction might make the material unrecognizable as stellar ejecta from @xmath0  car on dynamical grounds , leaving chemical abundances of the diluted material as the only potential diagnostic .",
    "smith & morse ( 2004 ) presented spectra of the outer ejecta of @xmath0 car , showing that while ejecta immediately outside the homunculus were already known to be nitrogen rich and severely depleted of oxygen ( davidson et al .",
    "1982 ; dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) , [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] lines became stronger with increasing separation from the star .",
    "in that paper we proposed that the nitrogen rich condensations ejected at high speed by @xmath0  car are overtaking a normal - composition `` cocoon '' deposited by previous stellar - wind mass loss , and that this interaction gives rise to the soft x - ray shell around @xmath0  car ( corcoran et al .",

    "the images reported here were obtained with a narrowband ( @xmath780  - wide ) filter centered on [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 .",
    "several individual 60 sec exposures were obtained with slight positional offsets to fill the inter - chip gaps and to correct for severe ccd blooming by @xmath0  car , with a total exposure time of 300 sec over most of the observed area .",
    "images were reduced in the standard fashion with the mscred package in iraf , and absolute sky coordinates were computed with reference to usno catalog stars . a section of the ctio image showing the environment around @xmath0  car is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "we also observed @xmath0  car on 2003 august 8 ( program go-9775 ) with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) through the f502n filter to capture [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 emission from the circumstellar environment .",
    "we compared these data with similar f502n images from the _ hst _ archive obtained on 1993 december 31 to search for temporal flux variations and proper motions of nebular structures .",
    "table  1 contains a log of the wfpc2 f502n observations .",
    "each data set consisted of several individual exposures with a range of integration times .",

    "simple alignment with rotation and mosaicing using the wmosaic task in stsdas does not give sufficiently accurate registration , so we used @xmath715 field stars as tie points to establish a common coordinate frame ( see also morse et al .",

    "1987 , 1993 , 1996 ; morse et al .  1998 ; weis 2001 ) . instead of the dense knots and filaments of the nitrogen - rich outer ejecta ,",

    "emission in spectra ( smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "] this veil has a thin , limb - brightened outer edge best seen northwest of the homunculus , especially in _ hst _ images of the same emission line ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the difference between [ o  iii ] and [ n  ii ] emission is striking in the color representation of figure 3 . no clear outer edge to the [ o  iii ] veil",
    "is seen south of the homunculus , which is probably related to the lack of soft x - ray emission in that direction ( seward et al .",
    "2001 ) . the southern part of the veil may also be missing because of a lack of ionizing photons ( see below ) .",
    "smith & morse ( 2004 ) proposed the existence of a normal - composition `` cocoon '' surrounding @xmath0  car ; as the nitrogen - rich outer ejecta run into this cocoon , their chemical abundances are modified to include varying amounts of oxygen .",
    "independent from its excitation mechanism , the [ o  iii ] emission in figures 1 and 2 indicates a smooth distribution of gas with a significant amount of oxygen and with a different morphology from that of the nitrogen - rich ejecta ( see fig .",
    "3@xmath15 ) .",
    "this indicates that there is indeed oxygen surrounding the outer ejecta , confirming the existence of the `` cocoon '' .",
    "figure 1 also shows a larger shell structure , seen as a thin filament adjoining the southeastern corner of the `` veil '' , extending toward the east for about 1@xmath145 , and then turning northward and looping back toward the keyhole nebula .",
    "part of this shell structure was seen by bohigas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but they interpreted this as part of a large bipolar structure with a polar axis running northeast to southwest ",
    "perpendicular to that of the homunculus .",
    "this bipolar shape is not confirmed by our new images . in our higher resolution",
    "image , this structure gives the impression of an expanding bubble whose progress was thwarted toward the south by the ejecta around @xmath0  car ; it looks as though a veil were draped over the homunculus as @xmath0 car and its dense ejecta punch into the shell .",
    "this shell and veil may mark the interaction of stellar winds and dense ejecta .",
    "interestingly , the very hot and massive o4  v((f ) ) star hd  303308 ( walborn 1973 ;",
    "walborn et al .",
    "2002 ) , which should have a powerful stellar wind and strong uv radiation , is seen projected inside this bubble .",
    "hd  303308 may be partly responsible for the appearance of this shell , as noted by bohigas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . despite being one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy ,",
    "@xmath0  car itself is a pitiful source of ionizing radiation because its dense stellar wind and the dusty homunculus nebula trap the uv output of the central star .",
    "however , o@xmath16 requires a significant flux of photons above 54 ev .",
    "thus , the [ o  iii ] emission in figure 1 requires some other source for its ionization and excitation .",
    "[ o  iii ] emission is brightest on the northern side of the cocoon around @xmath0  car , pointing toward radiation or the stellar wind from hd  303308 as the most likely culprit .",
    "shocks could excite the [ o  iii ] line , but this is unlikely due to the slow velocity of the veil , unless it is a standing shock ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , optical spectra of the `` w arc '' ( the thin filament at the western edge of the veil around @xmath0  car ; smith & morse 2004 ) and part of the distant [ o  iii ] shell ( bohigas et al .",
    "2000 ) show line ratios typical of photoionized gas in an h  ii region , but with higher densities than surrounding regions of the carina nebula .    even if the [ o  iii ] emission is not currently dominated by shock excitation",
    ", the veil in figures 1 and 2 may trace a photoionized density enhancement or contact discontinuity in a standing shock front , resulting from the interaction of dense ejecta and a stellar wind .",
    "for example , suppose that leading up to the great eruption in the 1840 s ( or more likely , leading up to the last major eruption before the 19th century outburst ) @xmath0  car had a dense stellar wind , comparable to its extreme present - day wind but with roughly solar composition",
    ". this would be the case for the stellar wind before cno ashes first made their way to the surface of the star . at some point , this dense wind would interact with the faster and more rarefied stellar winds from massive o - type stars in the trumpler 16 cluster , like hd  303308 .",
    "if this scenario applies , then the [ o  iii ] veil seen in figures 1 and 2 is the terminal shock , or `` astropause '' of @xmath0  car s stellar wind .",
    "car s undiluted stellar wind . ]",
    "in addition to showing the structure of the [ o  iii ] veil in more detail than ground - based images , our multi - epoch _ hst _ images taken with the same filter and instrument can also constrain the motion of the shell . with a time baseline between the 1993 and 2003 wfpc2 images of 9.6 yr",
    ", we can measure the positions of nebular features to an accuracy of 10 - 20% of a wf pixel ( 0@xmath121 ) , sensitive to motion comparable to the sound speed in ionized gas .",
    "an efficient way to search for movement is to subtract registered frames at two epochs ( e.g. , morse et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that moving condensations show adjacent light and dark features .",
    "this is shown in figure 3@xmath17 for the wf3 images in the f502n filter .",
    "the expansion of the homunculus is clear in figure 3@xmath17 , as is the movement of the nn jet and s condensation . in all three of these cases ,",
    "the moving material is fast ( @xmath18  km s@xmath3 ) and is seen as dust - scattered continuum light in the f502n filter , instead of [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "figure 3@xmath17 shows no sign of proper motion in the veil , where all the thin filamentary [ o  iii ] emission has subtracted to better than the residual noise .",
    "we find essentially no detectable motion nor surface brightness variation of the [ o  iii ] veil during the @xmath710 yr time interval .",
    "the lack of any discernable proper motion is obvious when one blinks between the images at the two epochs on a computer monitor .",
    "if the outer veil is expanding at all , it is moving very slowly compared to the ejecta closer to @xmath0 car .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of intensity tracings through the w arc in the 1993 and 2003 f502n images .",
    "the limb - brightened edge of the w arc corresponds to the strong feature at @xmath733  from the star ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath15 ) .",
    "again , the [ o  iii ] veil shows no proper motion . to quantify this , we measured the positions of the w arc at both epochs from the tracings in figure 4 using five different methods : a flux - weighted centroid , cross - correlation , and gaussian , lorentzian , and voigt profile fits .",
    "we measured proper motion of + 11@xmath212 mas , or a tangential velocity of 12@xmath213 km s@xmath3 away from the star in the plane of the sky for a distance of 2250 kpc ( smith 2002@xmath15 ) .",
    "this measurement uncertainty is comparable to the uncertainty in the registration of the two images , confirming that we do not detect any significant motion of the [ o  iii ] veil .",
    "the dynamical age of the [ o  iii ] veil is at least 3@xmath1310@xmath4 yr , but the true age of the veil could obviously be less if it has decelerated from its initial speed .",
    "thus , our data give little information on the actual age and origin of the [ o  iii ] veil , except that it is consistent with being the dense swept - up wind lost during a pre - outburst lbv phase .",
    "the slow motion of the [ o  iii ] veil also gives important clues about its excitation mechanism .",
    "its speed must be close to the sound speed in ionized gas .",
    "shock velocities @xmath19100 km s@xmath3 are normally required to account for [ o  iii ] emission ( e.g. , hartigan et al .",
    "1999 ) , implying that the veil is dominated by photoionization .",
    "the exception to this would be a stationary standing shock in colliding winds , but this would only make sense in the region directly between @xmath0 car and hd  303308 , not on the east and west sides of the veil . additionally , no x - ray emission has been reported from the region between @xmath0 car and hd  303308 , except for the soft x - ray shell around @xmath0 car , which is _ inside _ the veil .",
    "thus , we conclude that the most likely excitation mechanism for the [ o  iii ] veil is external uv irradiation by hd  303308 .",
    "based on spectra of several positions in @xmath0  car s outer ejecta , we proposed a shift in the nebular abundance pattern  from nitrogen - rich cno ashes near the star to more normal composition material farther away  and we suggested that this is the result of nitrogen - rich ejecta running into slower normal - composition material ( smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "the [ o  iii ] images we have presented here show a veil of bright oxygen emission , with a different and distinct morphology from that seen in nitrogen images ( fig .",
    "3@xmath15 ) ; the [ n  ii ] condensations are found inside the boundaries of the [ o  iii ] veil .",
    "we interpret this [ o  iii ] emission as a strong confirmation of the existence of the oxygen - bearing `` cocoon '' inferred from spectra .    the great eruption in the 1840 s ejected about 1015 m@xmath20 of material off the star ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath0  car may have experienced similar mass - loss episodes before that event ( walborn et al  1978 ) .",
    "if @xmath0  car has a mass of @xmath19100 m@xmath20 appropriate for its luminosity , then these mass ejections constitute a significant fraction of the star s initial mass , and would have comprised most of the star s initial outer radius .",
    "additionally , the mass lost during the great eruption is comparable to the total mass that was presumably lost in a normal stellar wind during the entire time that @xmath0 car was on the main sequence ( i.e. 10@xmath21 to 10@xmath22 m@xmath8 yr@xmath3 for @xmath73@xmath1310@xmath23 yr ) .",
    "thus , the removal of this mass in sudden outbursts may have stripped off the remaining outer layers of the star , down to the convective core boundary where cno - cycle ashes could be exposed . in that case",
    ", it is perhaps not surprising to see a dramatic and rather sudden shift in chemical abundances in the extensive ejecta blanket around @xmath0  car .",
    "the confirmation of the [ o  iii ] cocoon in the images presented here underscores our earlier speculation ( smith & morse 2004 ) about possible connections between the change in abundances and instability that may accompany the transition from hydrogen to helium core burning .",
    "the [ o  iii ] veil marks the outer boundary of @xmath0 car s undiluted ejecta envelope .",
    "all material inside the veil is ejecta from @xmath0 carinae itself , whereas outside we find ambient material in the h  ii region , stellar wind material from other o stars , or both of these mixed with @xmath0  car s ancient main - sequence wind . in this sense ,",
    "the limb - brightened edge of the [ o  iii ] veil is probably a contact discontinuity in the wind s terminal shock ",
    "i.e. it is the _ astropause _ of @xmath0 car .",
    "this is not like the astropause for a normal star ( like the heliopause ) where the wind has never reached the interstellar medium beyond .",
    "the situation is also unlike the standard theory for interstellar bubbles ( i.e. , castor , mccray , & weaver 1975 ) , where the wind of a single massive star blows a low - density bubble in a uniform surrounding medium , sweeping up a dense shell .",
    "instead , the observed structure around @xmath0  car is the result of a dense slow wind expanding into a cavity created by its own previous fast wind , and now being shaped from the outside by the fast lower - density wind of a nearby star . indeed , figure 1 gives the impression that the less dense wind and radiation from hd  303308 are sculpting the surrounding cavity , halting the expansion of the [ o  iii ] veil as adjacent ejecta from @xmath0  car are swept back .",
    "this scenario has severe asymmetries and time - dependent mass - loss ( @xmath0  car entering the lbv phase , followed by multiple eruptions ) that can not be dealt with easily in the analytic framework of stellar wind bubbles .",
    "a better way to look at the problem may be from the point of view of pressure balance between two interacting stellar winds .",
    "this astropause probably marks the limiting extent of a recent enhanced heavy mass - loss phase ( i.e. the lbv phase ) for @xmath0  car , which is now being eroded from the outside , whereas @xmath0 car s main - sequence wind probably filled much of the surrounding h  ii region .",
    "if the [ o  iii ] veil were produced by @xmath0 car s main - sequence wind , it would nt have the high overdensity compared to the adjacent wind bubble of hd  303308 ; indeed , on the main sequence , @xmath0  car was probably like the o2  if * supergiant hd  93129a ( taresch et al .",
    "1997 ; simon et al .",
    "1983 ) , and the wind would have been stronger than that of hd  303308 . instead , for the two winds to approximately balance with the much higher observed density on @xmath0 car s side",
    ", it makes more sense for @xmath0  car s wind to have filled the interior of the [ o  iii ] veil with a slower and denser wind .",
    "the interface between the winds should occur at the ram - pressure balance point between the two stars where @xmath24=@xmath25 , given by      where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the radial separations from each of the two stars .",
    "using @xmath2910@xmath30 m@xmath20 yr@xmath3 and @xmath31500 km s@xmath3 as plausible values for @xmath0 car s wind ,  car s wind ( hillier et al .",
    "2001 ) , which do nt necessarily apply before the great eruption . ] and @xmath3210@xmath21 m@xmath20 yr@xmath3 and @xmath333100 km s@xmath3 as likely values for the o4  v((f ) ) star hd  303308 ( repolust et al .",
    "2004 ) , we have @xmath349 .",
    "this would be much closer to hd  303308 than the observed position of the interface ; the actual observed value of @xmath35 suggests that @xmath0 car s pre - eruption mass - loss rate was lower  closer to 10@xmath36 m@xmath8 yr@xmath3 .",
    "car s mass - loss rate is higher now than it was before the great eruption , one can imagine why it might be true .",
    "the 19th - century great eruption removed at least 10 m@xmath8 from the star ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) , leaving @xmath0  car with a significantly higher l / m ratio after the outburst .",
    "the weaker gravity as compared to before the eruption brings it @xmath710%  closer to the eddington limit , making it easier for the radiation - driven stellar wind to lift material off the star . ]",
    "another reason to suppose that the astropause marks the wind from the beginning of @xmath0 car s lbv phase is the timescale involved . a coherent structure like the [ o  iii ] veil would disperse when its age exceeds the sound crossing time , which is roughly 6@xmath1310@xmath4 yr .",
    "this is much shorter than the @xmath73 myr main sequence lifetime for a m@xmath37=120 m@xmath8 star ( chiosi & maeder 1986 ) , but comparable to the expected duration of the lbv phase ( e.g. , bohannan 1997 ) .",
    "a mass - loss rate of perhaps 10@xmath36 m@xmath8 during that time ( see above ) would fill the volume of the [ o  iii ] veil , having a radius of roughly 30  or 10@xmath38 cm , with a mass of 6  m@xmath8 and an average density of about 400 cm@xmath30 .",
    "this is consistent with the electron density of 470@xmath2170 cm@xmath30 that we measured previously from spectra of the west edge of the veil ( smith & morse 2004 ) . at this density , however , thermal gas pressure alone is not enough to thwart the advance of hd  303308 s wind .",
    "this erosion will proceeded until denser inner parts of the cocoon are reached ; this resistance would require densities inside the cocoon of      where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath28 are the values for hd  303308 s wind , as above , and @xmath4310@xmath4 k is the temperature of the ionized gas inside the cocoon .",
    "for @xmath4410@xmath38 cm , the density inside the cocoon should be roughly 2000 cm@xmath30 , higher than observed at the edge of the veil ( unless @xmath28 is actually larger than the apparent separation in figure 1 due to a projection angle ) , but less than densities for some of the [ n  ii ] knots inside it ( smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "further observational work can potentially help clarify the nature of the [ o  iii ] veil seen in our images .",
    "for example , high dispersion long - slit spectra of the [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 emission line could be used to study the kinematics of the veil and the more extended shell .",
    "we would expect doppler shifts of the [ o  iii ] emission to be very different from [ n  ii ] lines .",
    "absorption profiles of ca",
    "ii and na  i in echelle spectra of numerous stars surrounding @xmath0 car might be used for the same purpose .",
    "if hd  303308 is inside a bubble as figure 1 suggests , then a detailed comparison of its absorption spectrum and those of several nearby stars may prove very interesting .",
    "finally , one could determine if the veil is a standing shock by searching for faint x - ray emission that may be associated with it .",

    "<S> this veil is part of a more extensive [ o  iii ] shell that appears to be shaped and ionized by hd  303308 . </S>",
    "<S> a pair of _ hst _ images with a 10 yr baseline shows no significant proper motion , limiting the expansion speed away from @xmath0  car to 12@xmath213 km s@xmath3 , or an expansion age of a few times 10@xmath4 yr . thus , this is probably the decelerated pre - outburst lbv wind of @xmath0 car . </S>",
    "<S> the [ o  iii ] morphology is very different from that seen in [ n  ii ] , which traces younger dense knots of cno - processed material ; this represents a dramatic shift in the chemical makeup of material recently ejected by @xmath0  car . </S>",
    "<S> this change in the chemical abundances of the ejecta may have resulted from the sudden removal of the star s outer envelope during @xmath0 car s 19th century outburst or an earlier but similar event . </S>"
