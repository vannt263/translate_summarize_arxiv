    "in this paper we continue the analysis concerning notions of tangential dimesions .",
    "our aim is that of finding dimensions describing the non - regularity , or fractality , of a given measure .",
    "the kind of non - regularity we study here is related to the fact that a dimension may have an oscillating behavior at a point .",
    "indeed dimensions are often defined as limits , and an oscillating behavior means that the upper and lower versions of the considered dimension are different .",
    "our main goal here is to associate to a measure a local dimension that is able to maximally detect such an oscillating behavior , namely for which the upper and lower determinations form a maximal dimensional interval .",
    "let us recall that we introduced first tangential dimensions in the framework of alain connes noncommutative geometry @xcite , as extremal points of the singular traceability interval @xcite .",
    "their explicit formulas suggested the definition of tangential dimensions at a point for a metric space , given in @xcite , where we showed that , under regularity conditions ( cf .",
    "theorem [ newformula ] @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , upper , resp .",
    "lower , tangential dimension of a metric space at a given point can be equivalentrly defined as the supremum , resp .",
    "infimum , of local dimensions of the tangent sets _ a la gromov _ at the point .    here",
    "we define tangential dimensions at a point for measures and show that , under the volume doubling condition , upper , resp .",
    "lower , tangential dimension of a measure at a given point can be equivalently defined as the supremum , resp .",
    "infimum , of local dimensions of the tangent measures at the point .",
    "finally we compute the tangential dimensions for some classees of fractals .",
    "indeed we give a condition ( condition [ newassum ] ) on a measure @xmath5 on a metric space @xmath6 under which the tangential dimensions for @xmath5 coincide with the tangential dimensions of @xmath6 and are locally constant . furthermore ,",
    "under the same condition , tangential dimensions for metric spaces and measures are extrema of local dimensions of the corresponding tangent objects .",
    "first we consider the class of self - similar fractas with open set condition , showing that in this case tangential dimensions do not give new information , indeed they coincide with the hausdorff dimension .",
    "then we consider the class of translation fractals , show that the mentioned condition is satisfied by translation fractals with open set condition for the canonical limit measure and compute the tangential dimensions for such measure .",
    "besides their coincidence with metric tangential dimensions , which follows by the results described above , direct inspection shows that they also coincide with the noncommutative tangential dimensions for the spectral triples associated to translation fractals computed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall define upper and lower tangential dimensions of a measure on a metric space @xmath6 and study some of their properties .",
    "the name tangential is motivated by the results in subsection [ subsub : tangentialformula ] , where we show that for radon measures on @xmath7 , under volume doubling condition , the upper , resp .",
    "lower , tangential dimension , is simply the supremum , resp .",

    "<S> our main purpose is that of introducing a tool which is very sensitive to the `` multifractal behaviour at a point '' of a measure , namely which is able to detect the `` oscillations '' of the dimension at a given point , even when the local dimension exists , namely local upper and lower dimensions coincide . </S>",
    "<S> these definitions are tested on a class of fractals , which we call translation fractals , where they can be explicitly calculated for the canonical limit measure . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> the tangential dimensions of the limit measure coincide with the metric tangential dimensions of the fractal defined in @xcite , and they are constant , i.e. do not depend on the point </S>",
    "<S> . however , upper and lower dimensions may differ . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , on these fractals , these quantities coincide with their noncommutative analogues , defined in previous papers @xcite , in the framework of alain connes noncommutative geometry . </S>"
