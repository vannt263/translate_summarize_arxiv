    "m3 ( ngc5272 : ra[2000 ] = 13:42:11 , dec[2000 ] = + 28:22:32 ) is one of the most important globular clusters of the galactic halo .",
    "it is located at @xmath0 11.9 kpc from the galactic centre , 10.0 kpc from the sun and 9.7 kpc above the galactic plane ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "it contains by far the largest number of variable stars ( bakos et al .",
    "2000 assign numbers to 274 variables ) with a rather high specific frequency ( i.e. normalized to total mass ) of rr lyrae stars .",
    "its metallicity , for a long time considered to be [ fe / h ] = 1.66 ( zinn & west 1984 , hereafter zw ) , has been revised using high resolution spectroscopic data of giant stars and appears to be somewhat higher , i.e. 1.47 ( kraft et al .  1992 ) or 1.50 ( kraft & ivans 2003 , hereafter ki ) in the fe@xmath1 metallicity scale , and 1.34 ( carretta & gratton 1997 in their own metallicity scale ) .    since the seminal paper by oosterhoff ( 1939 ) , that subdivided the globular clusters in two groups according to the mean period of their rrab variables ( @xmath2=0.55d and 0.65d , respectively )",
    ", m3 has traditionally been considered the prototype oosterhoff type i ( ooi ) cluster .",
    "the pulsational and evolutionary properties of its rr lyrae variables were used by sandage et al .",
    "( 1981 ) as a reference template for the ooi group to compare to the rr lyrae properties in other clusters , in particular those belonging to the oosterhoff ii ( ooii ) group . on this basis sandage et al .",
    "( 1981 ) reached the conclusion that there was a systematic period - shift ( at fixed light curve amplitude ) as a function of metallicity with respect to the assumed template relation ( i.e. m3 ) in the @xmath3 plane ; this effect was interpreted as due to a difference in luminosity , in the sense that longer period ( more metal - poor ) variables were intrinsically brighter .",
    "although the subsequent interpretations of the period - shift effect were rather controversial and involved the rle played by several other factors ( lee et al .",
    "1990 ; carney et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter csj ; sandage 1993 , clement & shelton 1999a , b ) , and the very existence of the period - shift was sometime questioned ( e.g. brocato et al .",
    "1996 ) , the position of m3 as _ the _ template ooi cluster was never questioned .",
    "however , the data for the rr lyrae variables used in all these analyses were still essentially the ubv photographic observations by roberts and sandage ( 1955 ) , baker and baker ( 1956 ) and sandage ( 1959 ) .",
    "a large and detailed morphological study of the light curve characteristics for 113 variables was performed by szeidl ( 1965 , 1973 ) , using photographic material taken over a long time baseline .",
    "it is only in the late 90s that systematic studies of the rr lyrae variables in m3 with ccd detectors were undertaken , leading to large very accurate bvi photometric databases : kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter kal98 ) with v data for 42 stars ; carretta et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter car98 ) with bvi data for 60 stars ; and corwin & carney ( 2001 , hereafter cc01 ) with bv data for 207 stars .",
    "these data offer the unprecedented opportunity to study the largest number of rr lyrae stars ever detected within a single globular cluster , using well defined light curves obtained in more than one color and at different epochs .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of the pulsational and evolutionary characteristics of 133 rr lyrae variables in m3 , selected among those with the best quality light curves .",
    "we describe in sect .",
    "2 the data we have used , and we introduce the blazhko effect and the definition of mean magnitudes and colors . in sect .",
    "3 we present the main relations between period , amplitude , magnitude and color , and in sect .",
    "4 we derive the reddening and discuss the calibration of temperatures and magnitudes . in sect .",
    "5 we derive the physical parameters of the stars and compare them with evolutionary models , and discuss specifically the stars that are in a more advanced stage of evolution . finally , in sect .",
    "6 we present the fourier analysis of the light curves and discuss the implications on the estimate of the stellar physical parameters . a summary and the conclusions of this analysis",
    "are given in sect .",
    "the data sets we have used for the present analysis are :    @xmath4 the bv data described in detail by cc01 . these consist of 83 pairs of bv frames taken in may 1992 , 102 pairs taken in april 1993 , and 5 v and 4 b frames taken in june 1997 , on a total of 207 variable stars .",
    "this is the main data set we have used for our analysis in the b and v bandpasses .",
    "@xmath4 the bvi data described by car98 . these consist of 65 to 69 frames in each color , taken in march 1990 and in feb - apr - may 1992 , on a total of 60 rr lyrae variables .",
    "this data set is the only one that provides information on the i bandpass .",
    "the b and v data have been used mainly to support and provide complementary information to the cc01 data .",
    "@xmath4 the data described by kal98 .",
    "these consist of 176 v frames taken in march - april 1996 , on a total of 42 rr lyrae variable stars . also these data were used to support and provide complementary information to the cc01 data .",
    "a detailed comparison of the intensity - averaged magnitudes from the cc01 data set with car98 , using common non - blazhko variable stars , shows that cc01 v magnitudes are brighter than car98 v photometry in the east and west fields by 0.065 and 0.020 mags , respectively . as for the b magnitudes ,",
    "cc01 photometry is brighter than car98 east and west fields by 0.107 and 0.025 mags , respectively .",
    "we remind the reader that car98 east field contains the variables n. 10 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 43 , 57 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 74 , 75 , 78 , 84 , 87 , 100 , 101 , 128 , 146 , 149 , 150 , 178 and 197 , and the west field contains the variables n. 6 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 41 , 42 , 46 , 47 , 58 , 66 , 67 , 76 , 77 , 88 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 121 , 129 , 130 , 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 , 140 , 142 , 143 , 155 , 167 , 168 , 170 , 188 and 209 . finally",
    ", car98 provided also i photometry with the warning that it may be affected by a zero - point error in the absolute calibration .",
    "we treat this problem in some detail in sect .",
    "4.1 , but we anticipate here that indeed car98 i data are most likely too faint by @xmath0 0.083 mag .",
    "+ the same type of comparison with kal98 data , using intensity integrated @xmath5 magnitudes for both data sets ( note however that the published kal98 @xmath5 are magnitude integrated ) , shows that the cc01 v magnitudes are brighter than kal98 v photometry in the south and north fields by 0.028 and 0.018 mags , respectively .",
    "+ car98 and kal98 data have been corrected by the above offsets , when they have been used along with cc01 data ( e.g. for blazhko stars ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , a comparison of cc01 photometry with 15 randomly selected secondary standard stars from sandage ( 1970 ) shows that cc01 v magnitudes are fainter by 0.009 @xmath6 0.024 mag , and the b magnitudes are brighter by 0.004 @xmath6 0.014 mag , as already noted by cc01 .",
    "only the stars with well defined light curves in both b and v bands have been taken into account for the present study .",
    "this led us to consider a total of 133 stars out of the 201 rr lyraes observed by cc01 , in particular 23 rrc out of 43 , 67 rrab out of 111 , and 43 blazhko stars out of 47 .",
    "the stars we have not considered in the present study all have very noisy light curves , which may be due to photometric errors ( contamination from companions ) or to intrinsic phenomena such as double - mode pulsation or unidentified blazhko modulation .",
    "they may be very interesting objects in themselves , and surely deserve further and more careful investigation ( cf .",
    "clementini et al .  2004 ) .",
    "however , for the purpose of the present analysis , we shall use only those stars that show the `` cleanest '' light curves so as to keep the noise at the minimum level , taking advantage of the fact that m3 is probably the only cluster where one can afford to be very selective , due to the richness of its variable star population .",
    "the blazhko effect , first noticed and studied by blazhko ( 1907 ) , is a modulation of the basic pulsation variability that produces variations of the light curve shape showing as larger photometric scatter and significant changes in the light curve amplitude .",
    "the timescale of this modulation is typically tens of days but can be as large as a few hundred days .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of this phenomenon , which however is still an open question .",
    "we refer the reader to smith ( 1995 ) for a recent and comprehensive discussion on this topic .",
    "according to cc01 data no less than @xmath032% of the total rr lyrae variable star population in m3 is affected by blazhko variability .",
    "this fraction might easily be larger if some of the stars with noisy light curves , that we have not considered in the present analysis , turn out to be blazhko variables in future studies .",
    "the frequency of this phenomenon we find in m3 is consistent with previous results in other stellar systems ( cf .",
    "smith 1995 ) and has been recently confirmed in another cluster , ngc3201 , where piersimoni et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have identified about 30% such stars .",
    "however , the detection of blazhko variability is not straightforward and needs monitoring the variables over several epochs , therefore it can easily go undetected even in relatively well studied clusters .",
    "the presence of blazhko stars within a population of regular rr lyrae variables may affect the global characteristics of this population , for example in all cases where the light curve amplitude is involved ( e.g. the period - amplitude or color - amplitude relations ) .",
    "it certainly produces a scatter in the relations among various parameters , possibly masking other subtle effects by drawning them into the noise .",
    "therefore , _",
    "the knowledge of the blazhko star population is essential in order to select a pure sample of regular stars that define the average characteristics of the cluster variable star population_.    in the following sections we shall investigate these effects and try to derive the main characteristics of the regular variable population .",
    "mean magnitudes @xmath7 and @xmath5 of the variables have been derived by integrating the light curves in intensity and converting the result of this integration to magnitudes .",
    "we have not tried to correct these values to the equivalent static values , as proposed by marconi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , since the amplitude - dependent correction to apply e.g. to @xmath5 would be at most 0.02 mag at a@xmath8=1.4 and all our stars have smaller amplitudes .",
    "we list the values of @xmath7 and @xmath5 thus derived for the rrc , rrab and blazhko stars in tables [ cfot ] , [ abfot ] and [ blafot ] , respectively , as well as the b and v light curve amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the corresponding rise time values ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) defined as the phase intervals between the minimum and maximum b and v light , respectively . for the rrab and blazhko stars",
    "we have calculated also the magnitude - integrated @xmath13 and @xmath14 at minimum light , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "these parameters have been derived with the help of fourier decomposition of the light curves , using 6 harmonics for the rrc - type and 6 to 15 harmonics for the rrab - type variables .",
    "for the blazhko stars we have considered separately the cc01 data taken in 1992 and 1993 , that provide different epochs for the study of the blazhko phenomenon .",
    "the mean colors of the rr lyare stars are a more controversial issue .",
    "the choice of which mean color best reproduces the color the star would have were it not pulsating is a long standing problem , and has been discussed by several authors ( cf .",
    "silbermann & smith 1995 and references therein for a detailed review and discussion of this topic ) . very briefly , several solutions have been proposed as `` best mean color '' , e.g. the magnitude - averaged ( b  v ) ( preston 1961 ; sandage 1990 ) , or the intensity - averaged @xmath16 ( davis & cox 1980 ) , or a combination such as @xmath17 ( lub 1977 ) , or @xmath16+c(a ) where c(a ) is an empirical correction for amplitude ( sandage 1990 ) .",
    "csj argued that , no matter how the average is done , the ( b  v ) colors are poor temperature indicators because they are distorted by surface gravity and non - lte effects during a non negligible fraction of the pulsation cycle around maximum light , that can produce excess emission in the b band .",
    "they proposed a few formulae to estimate the temperature , involving the ( b  v ) colors plus corrective factors due to metallicity or amplitude or period , and also a formula involving only period , amplitude and metallicity ( cf .",
    "their eq.s 13 - 16 ) . on the theoretical side , bono et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have calculated synthetic mean colors for convective pulsating models over a wide range of luminosities and temperatures , and found that indeed both ( b  v ) and @xmath16 colors differ from the equivalent static color by a quantity that is a function of the light curve amplitude .",
    "the corrections they derive ( their table 4 ) are generally similar to the empirical corrections estimated by sandage ( 1990 ) .    given the nearly unanimous consensus that @xmath18 colors plus some sort of amplitude - related correction reproduce reasonably well the equivalent static colors - that we shall call @xmath19 , we adopt this solution where the corrections are those estimated by bono et al .",
    "the values of @xmath19 are listed in tables [ cfot ] and [ abfot ] , where we report for convenience also the ( b  v)@xmath20 colors of the rrc and rrab stars taken from cc01 , that were calculated as @xmath21 . for a consistency check ,",
    "we have calculated the values of @xmath19 both from ( b  v ) and @xmath16 colors and applying the corresponding amplitude corrections , and we have verified that the results agree within 0.02 mag , and mostly within 0.01 mag . also the use of marconi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) formulation ( cf .",
    "16 ) to derive the static ( b  v ) colors produces similar values to @xmath19 within 0.01 mag .",
    "we estimate that typical internal errors of the average @xmath7 and @xmath5 magnitudes and @xmath19 colors are 0.01 and 0.02 mag , respectively .    for the blazhko stars listed in table [ blafot ] we have reported no mean colors from cc01 , because they were obtained from the combined 1992 and 1993 data sets and have lost information on the blazhko phase . instead , the @xmath19 colors for the two epochs separately can be derived from the corresponding @xmath22 and @xmath23 average magnitudes , and are listed in tab .",
    "[ blafot ] .",
    "these basic parameters of the rr lyrae variable stars are connected by relations that reveal important physical , evolutionary and pulsational characteristics .",
    "most of the considerations that we present below were already outlined by cc01 , but we repeat them here in more detail and for the sake of convenience in the following analysis .      the color - magnitude diagram of the full sample of 207 variable stars has been discussed already by cc01 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig1 ] a less populous but cleaner version based on the sub - sample of rrc and rrab stars studied in this paper , using the @xmath5 and @xmath19 values listed in tables [ cfot ] and [ abfot ] .",
    "the main characteristics already discussed by cc01 are here reconfirmed , namely : + i ) the blue and red edges of the color distribution are located at @xmath19=0.18 and 0.42 mag , respectively .",
    "note , however , that one star ( v178 ) is slightly bluer than this limit [ @xmath19=0.166 ] , and is the faintest of the entire group of rrc variables .",
    "+ ii ) there is overlap in color between rrc and rrab variables , that occurs in the interval @xmath00.24 to 0.30 .",
    "as cc01 noted , it is possible to draw a line slanting toward redder colors at brighter magnitudes that separates most of the rrab from the rrc variables , but still two unusually bright rrab stars ( v42 and v96 ) fall in the rrc area .",
    "whereas v96 might be dismissed because it has a somewhat incomplete light curve , v42 does not show any special problem in the photometry , and its unusual position in the cmd seems to be due to the combination of unusually bright @xmath5 and large amplitude color - correction .",
    "+ iii ) the blazhko stars ( not shown to avoid confusion ) overlap the area of the rrab stars avoiding however the reddest part of the color distribution : they only reach as red as @xmath24 0.39 with cc01 data .",
    "+ iv ) the magnitude distribution ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig1 ] ) shows that the main body of the rrab population peaks around @xmath5=15.64@xmath60.04 mag , and there is a clear separate group of 12 stars ( v26 , 31 , 42 , 48 , 58 , 60 , 65 , 104 , 124 , 146 , 186 , and 202 ) at brighter magnitudes ( all individual @xmath2515.56 , centered at @xmath2615.52@xmath60.02 ) .",
    "most of these stars were already noted as very luminous by cc01 .",
    "the main distribution of the rrc stars seems to be shifted by @xmath00.05 mag towards brighter magnitudes ( @xmath5=15.59@xmath60.06 mag ) , and also shows a tail of very luminous stars , in particular six ( v29 , 70 , 85 , 129 , 140 , and 170 ) that are all brighter than 15.5 .",
    "we do not see any statistically significant evidence of _ four _ populations from the @xmath5 distribution , as claimed by jurcsik et al .",
    "+ v ) on the faint end , the distribution appears to end statistically at @xmath2615.72 , as was found also by cc01 ; this value is taken to correspond to the lower envelope of the horizontal branch ( hb ) luminosity distribution , i.e. the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) .",
    "only 3 rrab stars are fainter than this value . based on the @xmath5 histogram of the rrab stars we note that the thickness of the hb is @xmath270.20 mag or @xmath00.30 mag , depending on whether we exclude or include the brighter stellar component ( cf . sandage & katem 1982 ) .",
    "+ vi ) the @xmath5 distribution of the blazhko stars ( not shown ) reaches about the same edges of the distribution of the normal stars , but is skewed towards the brighter magnitudes .",
    "a group of seven stars ( v3 , 14 , 24 , 44 , 78 , 130 and 143 ) are as bright as the more luminous group of regular stars identified in item iv ) , and in fact their average magnitude is @xmath5=15.52@xmath60.04 .",
    "the main population of blazhko stars has @xmath5=15.65@xmath60.05 which is basically identical to the mean value we find for the regular rrab variables .",
    "we note that the average magnitude of the blazhko stars in the small - amplitude blazhko phase appears to be @xmath00.02 mag fainter than in the large - amplitude phase , but this difference is hardly significant from the statistical point of view .",
    "as has long been known , the amplitudes of the rrab stars are strongly correlated with period , whereas the amplitudes of the rrc stars have a nearly flat distribution .",
    "a similar behaviour is shown by the rise time .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig2 ] the amplitudes a@xmath28 ( lower panel ) and the rise times @xmath11 ( middle panel ) of the blue light curves vs. period ( @xmath29 ) , and for ease of discussion the corresponding values of @xmath5 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the main body of the rrc distribution defines a clear nearly flat sequence in the a@xmath28 vs. @xmath29 plane .",
    "then there is a group of 3 stars at the short period end of this distribution , with particularly small amplitudes , and another group of 5 stars that seem to define a nearly parallel distribution to the main one , but shifted to larger amplitudes and/or longer periods .",
    "these stars also stand out in the @xmath11 vs. @xmath29 plane . in more detail :",
    "+ i ) the three short - period small - amplitude rrc stars are v105 , v178 and v203 ( shown as diamonds in fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig2 ] ) .",
    "they have normal values of @xmath5 , including v178 that has the shortest period and the faintest magnitude but its @xmath5 is still compatible with the general trend of @xmath5 vs period among the rrc stars .",
    "they seem to be a normal extension of the main rrc population , according to theoretical models ( bono et al .",
    "1997 ) and observational evidence also in other clusters ( clement & shelton 1999b ) , showing that first overtone pulsators do have decreasing amplitudes at the short period ( high temperature ) end of the distribution , i.e. a bell - shaped distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "stars with periods shorter than @xmath00.29 day ( @xmath300.54 ) and sinusoidal light curves with particularly small amplitudes have been found to exist also in several other globular clusters , as well as in the large sample of field lmc variables from the macho survey ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) and in the galactic bulge ( olech 1997 ) , where they show a well - defined peak in the period distribution and thus may define a separate population of variable stars .",
    "these stars could be second overtone ( rre ) pulsators ( see clement & rowe 2000 for references and a detailed discussion of this topic ) .",
    "thus , our three short - period small - amplitude rrc stars could be either second overtone or regular first overtone pulsators .",
    "a way to test the pulsation mode of v105 , v178 and v203 is to plot the fourier parameters @xmath31 vs. @xmath32 of their light curves , as we have done in sect .",
    "6.1 . anticipating the results presented there , we suggest that only v203 is a likely rre star , whereas v105 and v178 seem to be regular rrc stars .",

    "these stars are compatible with being _ unrecognized _ blazhko variables observed during the low - amplitude phase of the blazhko modulation , as we discuss below .",

    "all of them except one ( kg14 ) were already noticed in the previous section item iv ) for being significantly brighter than the main body of the rrab distribution .",
    "they have @xmath40 mag and can be considered to belong to the longp / overluminous group .",
    "some of these stars ( those with the longest period ) stand out from the main distribution also in the @xmath11 vs. @xmath29 plane .",
    "these stars seem to be well represented by the same quadratic relation defined by the rrab stars , shifted toward longer periods ( at fixed amplitude ) by @xmath41 0.06 .",
    "this shift corresponds approximately to the mean location traditionally assigned to ooii variables ( cf .",
    "sandage et al .  1981 ) .",

    "this is perhaps the most critical diagram because is a place where we can in fact test the correctness and accuracy of our own calibrations . to perform this test ,",
    "we have derived for each star the offset in @xmath38 with respect to the reference zahb level we have estimated at @xmath1051.66 at mid temperature range ( @xmath104=3.83 ) , and compared it with the corresponding offset in v magnitude with respect to the observed zahb level that we have identified at v=15.72 ( cf .",

    "therefore , we deduce that our calibration is reliable and accurate , within the uncertainties of these estimates , and we proceed with a more detailed comparison with stellar evolution models .",
    "we compare the luminosities and temperatures we have derived with three sets of theoretical evolutionary models for the zahb phase , i.e. sweigart ( 1997 , solar scaled [ fe / h]=1.6 , main sequence helium abundance y=0.23 , no helium mixing during the rgb phase ) , vandenberg et al .",

    "( 1995 ) for a helium abundance y=0.24 and two values of the hb stellar mass , 0.65 and 0.75 m@xmath84 .",
    "we see that our instability strip is systematically hotter by @xmath0150 k. the temperature of the blue edge of the instability strip , taken as the temperature of the second bluest rrc star in tab .",

    "( 1995 ) assumed m=0.65 m@xmath84 as appropriate for m3 and concluded that the zone between the fundamental blue edge ( fbe ) and the first overtone red edge ( fore ) , where both pulsation modes are possible , is populated mostly by rrab stars , and , hence , the direction of evolution on / near the zahb is mainly blueward .",
    "this would be in agreement with lee et al .",
    "( 1990 ) evolutionary models , and with the interpretation of the oosterhoff dichotomy as mostly due to the hysteresis mechanism in the pulsation modes .",
    "however , we do nt quite see this effect with our data : the fbe - fore zone appears to be populated by a nearly equal number of rrc and rrab stars in the m=0.65 m@xmath84 strip , and only at m=0.75 m@xmath84 the rrab stars outnumber the rrc . in a likely intermediate solution with m@xmath00.7 m@xmath84 the fbe - fore zone",
    "should still be populated by a non - negligible number of rrc stars .",
    "these considerations hold also with the temperatures and luminosities derived from the csj calibration , and would be even more important had we used the cooler temperature scale by m98 , hence casting some doubts on the hysteresis mechanism as the only or most important way to explain the oosterhoff dichotomy ( cf . sect .",
    "3.2.3 ) .",
    "if period changes and mode switching can be taken as indicative of direction of evolution , our result is confirmed by the study of period changes by cc01 who find a nearly equal number of rr lyrae stars near the zahb with decreasing and increasing periods .",
    "also , four double - mode pulsators have been found switching pulsation mode during the last few years : of these , three have switched from fundamental to first overtone mode , i.e. v79 ( clement et al .  1997 ; clement & shelton 1999b ) , v166 ( corwin et al .   1999 ) and v200 ( clementini et al .",
    "2004 ) , whereas one ( v251 ) has switched from first overtone to fundamental mode ( clementini et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that both redward and blueward evolution can occur among the hb stars in m3 .",
    "we also point out that cc01 noted several stars as having strongly variable periods over the last @xmath0 30 - 50 years , among them the three longp / overluminous rrc stars v70 , v129 and v170 .",
    "these period variations are too strong to be ascribed to a normal rate of evolution , and rather suggest irregularities in the pulsation ( possibly a prelude to mode switching ? ) : v70 and v129 have increasing periods , and v170 has a decreasing period .      in this diagram we see that the values of mass we have derived from the @xmath81 parameter and the luminosity follow quite well the theoretical trend with temperature , with only few stars deviating from the mean distribution by more than @xmath60.1 m@xmath84 .",
    "the scatter of this relation is further reduced by the use of the csj temperatures ( cf .",
    "[ cacciari.fig10 ] ) . from the present data listed in tables [ phyabc ] and [ phybla ] the average values of mass for the regular rrab and rrc stars with no photometric anomaly are @xmath110=0.71@xmath60.03 ( @xmath110=0.70@xmath60.05 from csj temperatures ) and 0.70@xmath60.05 m@xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the average mass of the blazhko stars is @xmath110=0.70@xmath60.08 , i.e. identical to the regular stars .",

    "evolutionary models ( i.e. 0.68 and 0.69 m@xmath84 , respectively ) , but are somewhat larger than the mass of vandenberg et al.s model , 0.64 m@xmath84 .",
    "this is due to the different temperature scale used by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which is slightly steeper than sf calibration and is hotter by @xmath0100 k at the reference mid range temperature @xmath104=3.83 .",
    "such a temperature difference leads to smaller values of the @xmath81 parameter by @xmath00.025 , that combined with the slightly smaller luminosities ( by @xmath00.008 in the @xmath61 ) lead to smaller values of the mass by @xmath09% , i.e. @xmath00.06 m@xmath84 .",

    "5.1.2 . here",
    "we show some additional models by sweigart ( 1997 ) , in particular the zahb corresponding to helium mixing dx=0.05 during the rgb phase , and three evolutionary tracks for no helium mixing and the reimers ( 1975 ) mass loss efficiency parameter @xmath112=0.446 , 0.378 and 0.300 .",
    "the helium mixing parameter dx measures the depth into which the mixing currents are assumed to penetrate the hydrogen shell : all of the helium produced exterior to that point is mixed into the envelope . as an example ,",

    "we notice the following :    \\i ) the lower envelope of the rrc and rrab star distribution is very well represented by the sweigart zahb with dx=0.0 . within the errors of these determinations , also the vandenberg et al .",
    "zahb , which is @xmath00.02 mag fainter , may provide an acceptable match .",
    "four rrab stars ( v76 , v77 , v134 and v197 ) fall below the zahb : they all have been noted for having somewhat incomplete and/or noisy light curves .",
    "\\ii ) if we consider that an intrinsic thickness of @xmath00.1 mag of the stellar distribution is normal ( see also fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig1 ] ) , as it corresponds to that part of the hb evolutionary phase where the stars spend most of their hb lifetime , there is however a good number of stars that are brighter than this value . for these we can think of three possible explanations : + 1 .",
    "the most obvious ( and least interesting ) suggestion is that the photometry for some of these overluminous stars may be contaminated by the presence of a companion .",
    "although this phenomenon is likely to be rather unfrequent , table [ abfot ] notes that 3 of the 4 brightest rrab stars ( v48 , v58 , v146 and v186 , all with @xmath1131.74 ) may have companions making them appear to be too bright .",
    "further , all four stars do not have unusually long periods for their colors or temperatures , indicating they have higher gravities and lower luminosities .",
    "the overluminous stars could be stars that have undergone some degree of mixing during the rgb phase , and have therefore a slightly higher abundance of helium in the atmosphere which makes them brighter ( sweigart 1997 ) .",
    "this is compatible with observational spectroscopic evidence , e.g. enhanced c - isotope ratios and lithium abundance ( pilachowski & sneden 2001 ) , and the cn - ch anticorrelation ( lee 1999 ; smith et al .  1996 ) among m3 red giants that suggests the presence of mixing and dredge - up of processed material ( including helium ) in the atmosphere of these stars .",
    "we have plotted for comparison the sweigart ( 1997 ) zahb model for a mixing value dx=0.05 and we see that all our stars fall below this zahb , except the three brightest rrc stars . the explanation based on the mixing hypothesis can only be tested with a high - resolution abundance analysis of these stars , that should possibly be extended to include the entire hb from red to blue for a more accurate and conclusive analysis of this issue . incidentally ,",
    "high resolution spectra can also be used to explore line broadening ( provided the exposure times are short enough to avoid velocity smearing and the observations are taken at carefully selected phases ) . in this respect",
    "we note that carney et al .",
    "( 2003 ) detected line broadening , that was interpreted as a sign of rotation , among luminous rgb and red hb stars in the field , and a similar behavior was found among luminous red giants in m3 by carney et al .",
    "rotation may contribute to either mixing or mass loss , and therefore have an influence on hb evolution .",
    "+ 3 . alternatively , or in addition to the previous explanation",
    ", the overluminous stars could be in a more advanced stage of evolution off the zahb than the main body of the rr lyrae variables . for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted three evolutionary tracks from sweigart ( 1997 ) models , corresponding to zero mixing and different values of the reimers mass loss parameter , i.e. @xmath112=0.446 , 0.378 and 0.300 ( note that the entire zahb is described by values of @xmath112 from 0.00 to 0.74 ) .",
    "we have selected these three values because they either start and evolve mostly within the instability strip ( @xmath112=0.300 ) , or they start hotter than the instability strip and evolve across it at a plausible luminosity ( @xmath112=0.378 and 0.446 ) .",
    "smaller values of @xmath112 start cooler than the strip and do nt enter it , and larger values of @xmath112 would cross the strip at too high luminosity levels and at a very fast evolutionary rate .",
    "we can see that basically all stars fall on or near the tracks with @xmath112 values between 0.300 and 0.378 , at various stages of evolution off the zahb , and some evolved stars would be consistent with higher values of mass loss ( @xmath1140.446 ) . in this respect",
    ", we do nt agree with the conclusion of jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that `` ... in m3 , on the average , rrc stars are already in a later phase of their hb evolution than the rrab variables '' .",
    "the difference between these two groups could simply be due to stochastically different mass loss that causes the less massive stars to populate the first - overtone ( bluer ) part of the instability strip .",
    "this would apply to all rrc stars , not only to the overluminous ones , in agreement with the fact that the average mass of the rrc stars seems to be about 0.02 m@xmath84 smaller than the mass of the rrab stars ( cf .",
    "5.1.3 ) , although this difference is indeed smaller than the r.m.s .",
    "errors of these determinations .    to test the plausibility of this explanation we have examined the hb lifetimes at various luminosity levels off the zahb using the @xmath112=0.300 track .",

    "nearly 80% of the total hb lifetime is spent between the zahb and the 0.3 mag brighter level .    in order to estimate the number of stars in the hb evolutionary phase we can use the _ fuel consumption equation _ by renzini & fusi pecci ( 1988 ) :    @xmath116 ( 9 )    where @xmath117 is the number of stars predicted by the stellar evolution theory in a given post - main - sequence evolutionary phase ,",

    "then , in a series of papers ( simon & clement 1993 , hereafter sc93 ; kovcs & zsoldos 1995 ; jurcsik & kovcs 1995 , 1996 ; kovcs & jurcsik 1996 , 1997 ; kovcs & kanbur 1998 ; kovcs & walker 2001 ) it was shown that appropriate combinations of terms of a fourier representation of rr lyrae light curves , along with the periods , correlate with intrinsic parameters of the stars such as metallicity , mass , luminosity and colors . the most recent analysis of fourier parameters and their physical meaning in the study of rr lyrae stars",

    "the fourier analysis may offer tremendous potential to the study of these stars ( e.g. their absolute magnitude hence distance , intrinsic colors hence reddening and temperature , mass and metal abundance ) , especially since large collections of good light curves are becoming available , even for distant stars , thanks to the photometric surveys dedicated to gravitational lensing events .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore the reliability of this type of analysis in more detail , and our m3 data are very useful tests of the several calibrations between fourier coefficients and physical parameters .",

    "we have decomposed the v light curves of all variables listed in tables [ cfot ] , [ abfot ] and [ blafot ] in fourier series of cosines , using 6 components for the rrc variables and 6 to 15 components for the rrab and blazhko stars .",

    "all the formulae defined by kovcs and collaborators relating physical stellar properties to fourier parameters are applicable and `` reliable '' only if the _ compatibility condition _ @xmath133 is met . in the calculation of the @xmath132 parameter",

    "they set rather strict criteria for regularity , one of them being @xmath144 , and conclude that only stars with small blazhko amplitude modulation can show regular light curves at some blazhko phases , a rather small fraction ( @xmath2720% ) of the total considered cases . therefore , a criterion such as @xmath144 could be quite effective at detecting non - regular ( blazhko ) stars , but is also more severe than the requirement @xmath141 set by kovcs & kanbur ( 1998 ) for the applicability of their formulae , and so excessively penalizing ( e.g. only 27 of our 67 supposedly regular rrab variables would meet this criterion ) . on the other hand , by adopting the criterion @xmath141 , we find that a relatively large fraction of known blazhko stars show regular curves at some blazhko phase .",
    "we conclude that _ the condition @xmath141 is not an effective indicator of the blazhko behaviour _ , contrarily to the conclusions reached by jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) .    in the following sections we shall apply kovcs & kanbur ( 1998 ) relations to all our target stars , but consider the results only when @xmath142 .",
    "we have adopted a slightly relaxed criterion with respect to the original one in order to improve the statistics , after we have verified that this does not lead to any significant difference in the resulting physical parameters .",
    "the first use of the fourier parameters is aimed at identifying the pulsation mode of the stars , which may be ambiguous in a few cases . in fig .",

    "we note that v202 , supposedly an rrab star with very long period and small amplitude , falls in the domain of the rrc pulsators .",
    "a few stars falling off the main rrc distribution ( cf . sect .",
    "3.2 ) are marked : we find again the overluminous variables v70 , v129 and v170 , and v203 that can be an rre pulsator , whereas v105 and v178 fall within the group of normal first overtone pulsators . in the lower panel we show the blazhko stars in the large amplitude ( filled circles ) and small amplitude ( open circles ) phase : they mostly fall in the typical rrab domain , except a few small - amplitude cases on the borderline and v41 in the small amplitude phase that falls clearly in the rrc domain ( but its light curve is rather bad and the @xmath132 parameter is large ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that , at least in the sample we have selected , all the blazhko stars seem to pulsate in the fundamental mode .",
    "although the physical link between the fourier parameters describing the shape of a light curve and the physical parameters of that particular pulsating star is not yet understood , nevertheless clear and well defined relations have been found empirically .",
    "the work by sc93 deals with first - overtone rr lyrae variables using fourier decomposition in cosine series of v light curves to estimate the mass , luminosity and temperature of these stars .",
    "the work by kovcs and collaborators has focussed instead on the fundamental pulsators , with the exception of kovcs ( 1998 ) who provides a relation to estimate the absolute magnitude @xmath146 of rrc stars .",
    "the relations defined for the rrab stars allow to derive parameters such as @xmath146 , [ fe / h ] , intrinsic color and temperature , based on the fourier decomposition in sine series of v light curves .",
    "therefore , before applying these relations we have corrected our phase parameters @xmath31 , @xmath147 and @xmath136 values ( listed in tables [ fparab ] and [ fparbla ] ) , that were derived from cosine series , by 1.57 , + 3.14 and 4.71 respectively .",

    "[ cacciari.fig15 ] , at fixed [ fe / h ] the period shift due to evolution that stands out in the period - amplitude plane disappears in the period-@xmath147 plane , where all stars follow the same relation irrespective of their evolutionary status .",

    "this effect could not be seen in sandage s target sample because of the lack of clearly identifiable evolved stars .",
    "therefore , if the period - shift ( at fixed amplitude ) that appears in the period - amplitude plane is due to metallicity differences , the same period - shift ( at fixed @xmath147 ) will appear also in the period-@xmath147 plane , and the variation in period will produce a variation in metallicity as estimated by sandage . if , however , the period - shift in the period - amplitude plane is due to evolution , there is no corresponding shift in the period-@xmath147 plane .",
    "so _ evolution off the zahb will produce no noise on metallicity determinations_.      the possibility of estimating intrinsic colors from the fourier parameters of the rrab stars has some important implications , allowing e.g. to estimate reddening and temperature of these stars .",

    "we conclude that these relations based on the fourier parameters may be of some use to estimate the average @xmath146 of a group of stars , when applicable and after proper calibration , but can not be trusted to yield _ accurate individual _ @xmath146 estimates .",
    "based on a grid of hydrodynamic pulsation models for rrc variables at various masses , sc93 showed ( their fig .",
    "2 ) that there is a clear relation between period and @xmath147 that depends essentially on mass , hence they derived a relation to estimate the mass for rrc stars :    @xmath182 ( 19 )    the zero - point of this relation is such that intermediate metallicity clusters of oosterhoff type i ( e.g. m3 , m5 , ngc 6171 ) have rrc variables with average mass around 0.6 @xmath85 , and metal - poor clusters of oosterhoff type ii ( e.g. m68 and m15 ) have rrc variables with average mass around 0.8 @xmath85 , in agreement with the values of mass for double - mode pulsators that were available and generally accepted at that time .",
    "however , the most recent estimates of mass for double - mode pulsators in m3 would support larger values by @xmath183 , as well as a nearly flat dependence on metallicity ( clementini et al .  2004 , cf . sect .",
    "4.3.1 ) .",
    "we have listed in table [ phyfc ] the mass values derived from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , and we compare them in fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig18 ] with a few zahb models .",
    "in addition to the clumpy distribution due to the distorted fourier temperatures , the mass distribution shows the opposite trend with respect to the theoretical distribution .    on a different absolute scale , jurcsik ( 1998 ) provides a relation to derive the mass of rrab - type variables :    @xmath184 $ ] ( 20 )    where the values of luminosity , metallicity and temperature have been taken from table [ phyfab ] ( all derived from fourier coefficients via eq .",
    "18 , 10 and 13 respectively , for self - consistency ) .",
    "we have listed in table [ phyfab ] the mass values derived from eq .",
    "also this mass distribution , like the rrc s , shows the opposite trend with respect to the zahbs reported in fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig18 ] , in addition to the distortion due to the temperature distribution .",
    "we conclude that the fourier transform approach , in its present formulation , does not provide reliable values of mass for the rr lyrae stars .",
    "once the basic physical parameters mass , luminosity and temperature are known , the gravity can be calculated , for the sake of completeness , simply using the equation of the stellar structure :    @xmath185 ( 21 )    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are in solar units . as a consequence of the mass distributions discussed above",
    ", we can see in fig .",
    "[ cacciari.fig18 ] that the gravity distributions also fail to match the zahbs .    as a final comment ,",
    "we stress again that the use of fourier coefficients to estimate the physical parameters of the rr lyrae stars , that might produce acceptable _ average _ results in some cases , e.g. with metallicity or luminosity after careful and proper calibration , is not presently able to provide reliable estimates of intrinsic colors hence temperatures and temperature - related parameters .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the pulsational and evolutionary characteristics of 133 rr lyrae variables in m3 , selected among those with the best quality light curves from the cc01 data set .",
    "the availability of additional data sets ( car98 and kal98 ) at different epochs has allowed us to study in good detail the characteristics of the blazhko stars .",
    "mean magnitudes and colors , along with periods , light curve amplitudes and rise times , have been used to discuss the pulsational properties of these stars . a critical discussion of the temperature determination process ( i.e. temperature indicators and calibrations ) has been presented , and the physical parameters and evolutionary characteristics of these stars have been estimated .",
    "the unusual richness of rr lyrae stars in m3 and the excellent quality of the available data has allowed us to identify a good number of stars in a more evolved stage of evolution off the zahb and study their characteristics .",
    "finally , we have performed a fourier analysis of the v light curves and estimated the _",
    "pros _ and _ cons _ of this technique when applied to the study of rr lyrae properties .",
    "@xmath4 the basic characteristics of the cmd already discussed by cc01 are here reconfirmed , namely i ) the blue and red edges of the instability strip are located at ( b  v)=0.18 and 0.42 , respectively ; the rrc and rrab stars overlap in color in the interval @xmath0 0.24 to 0.30 .",
    "ii ) the @xmath5 distribution is bimodal , with a main peak around @xmath5=15.64 and a secondary peak around @xmath5=15.52 .",
    "there is no significant evidence of _ four _ populations as claimed by jurcsik et al .",
    "the intrinsic magnitude thickness of the hb within the instability strip is @xmath270.20 mag if we consider only the main ( fainter ) component , or @xmath00.30 mag if we include also the brighter one .",
    "@xmath4 at least one third of the rr lyrae stars in m3 are affected by blazhko modulation ; in the studied sample , they all belong to the rrab group .",
    "more can be hidden in the sample we have not taken into account in the present analysis because of large scatter in the light curves .",
    "the presence of unidentified blazhko stars causes a scatter in the relations among various observable parameters , that may be large enough to hide the presence of sub - groups with different characteristics .",
    "the properties of blazhko stars at the blazhko phase corresponding to the largest light curve amplitude are generally more similar to the characteristics of regular rrab stars than at smaller amplitude phases .",
    "the average @xmath5 magnitude does not vary significantly with blazhko phase .",
    "the @xmath5 magnitude distribution of the blazhko stars is the same as that of the regular rrab stars , including the bimodal shape .",
    "the average @xmath186 color distribution is also similar to the rrab s , but is truncated at a bluer color , i.e. there are no blazhko stars redder than @xmath187 0.39 .",
    "@xmath4 in the period - amplitude diagram both rrc and rrab stars are located on well defined sequences , that are more accurately represented by quadratic rather than linear relations ( especially the sequence of the rrab stars ) , in agreement with theoretical models .",
    "there is clear evidence of nearly parallel sequences for both rrc and rrab stars , shifted towards longer periods and populated by systematically brighter stars than the respective main stellar groups . from our sample of 133 rr lyraes",
    "we have identified 19 such stars ( 9 rrab , 5 blazhko and 5 rrc ) , that are all consistent with a more advanced stage of evolution off the zahb .",
    "their distributions are similar to the mean distributions of ooii rrc and rrab variables .",
    "the dependence of the p - a@xmath8 relation on oosterhoff type and/or evolutionary status rather than metallicity supports the conclusion that the oosterhoff dichotomy is due to evolution .",
    "the numbers of rr lyrae stars we have found in m3 near the zahb and evolved off the zahb are consistent with evolutionary lifetimes according to well established theoretical considerations .",
    "one of the three shortest period and lowest amplitude rrc stars is likely to be a second overtone pulsator .",
    "@xmath4 after a critical discussion of what is the most reliable mean color as an indicator of the equivalent static color for an rr lyrae star , we have decided to use the formulation @xmath188 plus amplitude related corrections based on theoretical models ( bono et al .",
    "1995 ) that are quite consistent also with empirical estimates ( sandage 1990 ) . from these colors and using a few independent methods we have estimated a mean reddening e(b ",
    "v)=0.01@xmath60.01 for m3 .",
    "a comparative evaluation of various temperature scales has led us to identify two temperature scales that meet both theoretical ( pulsational and evolutionary ) requirements and observational evidence on mass and luminosity for the rr lyrae stars using ( b  v ) colors ( in absence of v ",
    "k colors ) .",
    "these scales are from m98 ( theoretical calibration ) and sf .",
    "they differ by @xmath0150 k ( m98 being cooler ) , and yield on average pair values of mass(m@xmath84)/m@xmath8(mag ) about 0.74/0.59 and 0.69/0.54 , respectively .",
    "the temperature scale by csj is very similar to sf s and is independent of color , but is defined only for rrab stars . considering that the m98 calibrations based on the ( v  k ) colors are supposed to be more reliable and are both @xmath0100 k hotter than the corresponding calibrations based on ( b  v ) colors",
    ", we have adopted the hotter temperature scale by sf for our analysis ( corresponding to a distance modulus of 15.07 for m3 ) . however , our considerations would hold also with the cooler ( b  v)-based m98 scale and a distance modulus of 15.02 , within the errors . by using the sf temperature scale and the ( b  v)@xmath42 colors",
    "we have derived the stellar physical parameters ( temperature , luminosity , mass and gravity ) for our stars , and compared them with the most recent stellar evolution and pulsation models .",
    "the agreement is good , and confirms that the adopted calibration is reliable and accurate , and yields fully consistent results with the theoretical framework within the respective errors .",
    "the use of the csj temperature scale yields equally good or better ( less dispersed ) results , for the rrab variables only .",
    "@xmath4 we have applied the fourier transform technique to our variables .",
    "the main aim was to exploit our excellent data set and investigate the reliability of this type of analysis .",
    "first , we have derived the @xmath132 parameter , defined by jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) as a quality indicator of the regularity of the light curve shape . only for @xmath141",
    "the physical parameters derived from fourier coefficients are considered `` reliable '' , according to kovcs & collaborators prescriptions .",
    "we have adopted @xmath142 to increase the statistics with no significant loss of accuracy .",
    "we have found that @xmath132 is effectively unable to distinguish between blazhko and non - blazhko stars unless set to an unpractically low value ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "even among blazhko stars , one can find the recommended value @xmath141 as frequently at small - amplitude as at large - amplitude blazhko phases . about the fourier analysis results ( for stars with @xmath142 )",
    ", we have found the following : + i ) [ fe / h ] estimates seem on average acceptable , but are @xmath00.1 dex more metal - rich than the high resolution spectroscopic abundances of red giant stars derived by ki .",
    "a recalibration of the [ f / h]-period-@xmath147 relation using 287 rrab variables in 18 globular clusters performed by sollima et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using a non - parametric fitting method and ki metallicity scale yields similar average metallicity values to those derived from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , within the errors .",
    "this indicates that m3 lies @xmath00.1 dex off ( on the metal - poor side ) the mean relation defined by the calibrating globular clusters .",
    "however , the use of a different fitting method and/or metallicity scale , such as sollima et al.s , produces a different _ shape _ of the metallicity distribution , that might become relevant in the case of a composite population with a non - negligible metallicity dispersion .",
    "evolution off the zahb does not affect [ fe / h ] determinations .",
    "the inclusion of blazhko stars in a sample of regular stars does increase the scatter in the [ fe / h ] determinations , as blazhko stars at low amplitude phase appear as more metal - rich .",
    "if this effect is taken into account , there is no evidence of metallicity spread among the rr lyrae stars in m3 .",
    "+ ii ) intrinsic colors and temperatures estimated from eq.s ( 11)-(15 ) show serious discrepancies with observed color distributions and theoretical ( pulsational and evolutionary ) requirements , and can not be taken as reliable results .",
    "+ iii ) absolute magnitudes are affected by a `` compression '' effect that reduces their scatter by a factor @xmath02 compared to the observed @xmath5 distribution .",
    "this makes them unreliable as _ accurate individual _",
    "values , but they may provide useful averages for groups of stars , if applicable and after proper calibration .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "errors are however significantly underestimated .",
    "+ iv ) the values of mass show a distribution with temperature that has the opposite trend with respect to the zahb .",
    "consequently , also the values of gravity are affected by serious uncertainties .",
    "neither estimates can be taken as reliable results .    in general",
    ", it appears that the physical parameters of rr lyrae stars derived from the fourier decomposition of the v light curves should be taken with considerable caution .",
    "in particular , intrinsic colors hence temperatures and temperature - related parameters ( e.g. mass and gravity ) are seriously inaccurate .",
    "possible exceptions are [ fe / h ] , that seem to be acceptable within r.m.s",
    ". errors of @xmath60.15 dex ( provided blazhko stars are not included in the analysis and only average values are considered ) , and absolute magnitudes if taken as the mean value for a group and not as individual values .",

    "<S> we have performed a detailed study of the pulsational and evolutionary characteristics of 133 rr lyrae stars in the globular cluster ngc5272 ( m3 ) using highly accurate bvi data taken on 5 separate epochs . </S>",
    "<S> m3 seems to contain no less than @xmath032% of blazhko stars , and the occurrence and characteristics of the blazhko effect have been analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a good number ( @xmath0 14% ) of overluminous rr lyrae stars that are likely in a more advanced evolutionary stage off the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) . </S>",
    "<S> + physical parameters ( i.e. temperature , luminosity , mass ) have been derived from ( b  v ) colors and accurate color - temperature calibration , and compared with horizontal branch evolutionary models and with the requirements of stellar pulsation theory . </S>",
    "<S> additional analysis by means of fourier decomposition of the v light curves confirms , as expected , that no metallicity spread is present in m3 . evolution off the zahb does not affect [ fe / h ] determinations , whereas blazhko stars at low amplitude phase do affect [ fe / h ] distributions as they appear more metal - rich . </S>",
    "<S> absolute magnitudes derived from fourier coefficients might provide useful average estimates for groups of stars , if applicable , but do not give reliable _ individual _ values . </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic colors derived from fourier coefficients show significant discrepancies with the observed ones , hence the resulting temperatures and temperature - related parameters are unreliable . </S>"
