    "the influence of polymer adsorption onto surfaces has been a topic that has attracted much attention for several decades .",
    "this is not only because of its great practical interest , but also because it serves as a testing ground of theoretical models for confined polymer systems @xcite .",
    "recently , investigations have been dedicated to study the interplay between colloidal particles and polymers @xcite . in these systems the _ curvature _ of the surface of the colloidal particle becomes a factor , and work has focused on the situation where either the colloidal particle is much larger or much smaller than the polymer coil @xcite .",
    "when the radius of curvature is large , it is reasonable to expand the free energy for polymer adsorption in curvature .",
    "helfrich supplied the general form of the surface free energy expanded to second order in the curvature @xcite : @xmath2 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : helfrich_free_energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the local radii of curvature .",
    "apart from the surface tension , @xmath5 , one can identify three parameters in the helfrich free energy that describe the physical properties of the curved interface : the spontaneous curvature @xmath6 , the bending rigidity constant @xmath7 , and the gaussian rigidity @xmath8 .",
    "a great deal of attention has turned to the determination of the value of these curvature parameters in complex systems , both theoretically and experimentally . for surfaces interacting with polymers ,",
    "the curvature parameters were calculated by a number of groups @xcite . in the work by eisenriegler and others @xcite ,",
    "the polymer density is assumed to be zero at the surface of the colloidal particle so that a depletion layer exists around each particle . for surfaces with _ enhanced _",
    "polymer adsorption , calculations @xcite were performed in the context of the ground state dominance approximation @xcite in which the polymer chain length is essentially infinite . in the present work",
    ", we use recent extensions to ground state dominance to determine corrections to the curvature parameters due to the finite length of the polymer chain .",
    "such a calculation is of interest since the polymer chain length is an important parameter in experiments and computer simulations @xcite thus providing a more stringent testing of theoretical models .",
    "moreover , it was expected @xcite , and later verified @xcite , that in certain situations , the ` tails ' of the polymer chain become important , leading to _ qualitatively _ different behavior .",
    "an example is the repulsion between two planar walls when the separation is of the order of the polymer s radius of gyration @xcite . in the ground state dominance model",
    "the radius of gyration is infinite and the interaction between plates is attractive for all separations @xcite .",
    "the first extension of the ground state dominance model was proposed by semenov , bonet - avalos , johner , and joanny @xcite .",
    "they took the presence of tails into account by including a _",
    "second _ order parameter related to the end segment density .",
    "good agreement was obtained for the loop and tail distribution of adsorbed polymer when the theoretical predictions are compared with lattice self - consistent mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "the two - order parameter model was later extended to also take into account the presence of free ( non - adsorbed ) polymer away from the surface @xcite .",
    "subsequently , semenov showed that the two - order parameter model may be cast into a free energy formalism of a single order parameter @xcite in which the euler - lagrange equations are the edwards equations , just as de gennes had previously done in the context of the ground state dominance approximation @xcite . in this article , we use the expression for the free energy by semenov @xcite to determine the polymer length corrections to the curvature parameters .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we review the description of finite chain length corrections to polymer adsorption on a planar wall in the two - order parameter model .",
    "we show how from the two - order parameter model a _ single _ order parameter model , to which we refer to as the semenov model , is constructed to describe leading order corrections in @xmath1 to ground state dominance . in section 3 , the single order parameter model is applied to the study of curved surfaces .",
    "explicit expressions for the surface tension and curvature parameters are given .",
    "we end with a discussion of results .",
    "before addressing the properties of curved surfaces , we discuss finite chain length corrections to the structure and tension of polymer adsorption onto a _",
    "planar _ surface .",
    "we then generalize the description to polymer adsorption onto curved surfaces .",
    "the situation under consideration is that of a polymer chain adsorbed onto a planar wall located at @xmath9 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the calculations presented here are performed in the context of self - consistent mean - field theory whereby a _ single _",
    "polymer chain is considered with the effect of the other polymers taken into account by the presence of an external field proportional to the local segment density @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of the polymer with the wall is taken into account through an infinitely short - ranged ( attractive ) interaction potential @xcite .    before taking the finite length of the polymer chain into account ,",
    "we remind ourselves of the de gennes - lifshitz description @xcite for polymer adsorption of an _ infinite _ chain , the so - called _ ground state dominance approximation_. the free energy is a functional of the polymer segment density @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11}{a \\ , k_{\\rm b } t } = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty } \\!\\ ! dz \\left [ \\frac{a^2}{24 } \\ , \\frac{\\phi^{\\prime}(z)^2}{\\phi(z ) } + \\frac{v}{2 } \\ , [ \\phi(z ) - \\phi_b]^2 \\right ] - \\frac{1}{d } \\ , \\frac{a^2}{6 } \\ , \\phi_w \\ , , \\label{eq : gsd_free_energy_phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 the surface area , and @xmath15 is the polymer segment length .",

    "the first term is the lifshitz expression for the chain entropy @xcite , the second term gives the mean - field interaction between polymer segments in a good solvent ( @xmath20 is the _ excluded volume _ parameter ) , and the last term accounts for the polymer interaction with the surface @xcite ( @xmath21 is the _ extrapolation length _ ; its inverse measures the interaction strength with the surface ) .",

    "free energy since it is constructed such that when the polymer segment density becomes equal to the bulk segment density , @xmath22 , the integrand reduces to zero .",
    "the result is that the surface tension is equal to the above free energy per area when evaluated at its minimum , i.e.  when the ` optimum ' segment density profile , determined by the euler - lagrange equation , is inserted into it @xcite .    rather than the segment concentration , it is convenient to consider the free energy as a functional of @xmath23 : @xmath24}{a \\ , k_{\\rm b } t } =   \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty } \\!\\ !",

    "we find that if the adsorption strength is sufficiently low , the leading correction due to the finiteness of the polymer chain to the surface tension and curvature parameters is to _ reduce _ the effect of polymer adsorption on these coefficients .",
    "the magnitude of this effect may be considerable already for long polymer chains , especially when the bulk polymer density is low .    for strong adsorption , we find that the leading contribution to the curvature parameter _ changes sign_. this means that shortening the polymer chains now _ enhances _ the effect polymers have on the curvature parameters .",
    "this seems a bit surprising since it is expected that for very short chains , the influence of these chains becomes less pronounced .",
    "still , our result is not necessarily in contradiction with this expectation since for small @xmath0 _ all _ the terms in the expansion in @xmath1 are important .",
    "one would like to understand the _ physical reason _ behind this `` enhancement effect '' .",
    "mathematically , the effect is traced back to the non - monotonic behavior of the leading correction to the segment density profile @xmath150 , which is directly linked to the leading corrections to the spontaneous curvature ( @xmath139 ) and the gaussian rigidity ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "( an equivalent argument can be made for the bending rigidity ( @xmath140 ) which is determined by the behavior of @xmath151 . )    in figure 5 , we have plotted @xmath150 for various values of the adsorption strength . for weak adsorption , @xmath150 monotonically increases to zero at large distances indicating that short chains adsorb less . for strong adsorption",
    ", two regions may be identified : in the vicinity of the wall the segment density profile is dominated by polymer ` loops ' . in this region @xmath150 is close to zero indicating that the polymer density is independent of chain length . at somewhat larger distances from the wall",
    "the profile is dominated by the polymer ` tails ' [ 2 , 24 ] .",
    "here @xmath150 goes through a minimum and then monotonically increases to zero at large distances .",
    "one may therefore conclude that , although the total adsorption is less when the chain length is reduced , the segregation between a region dominated by loops and a region dominated by tails is more pronounced leading to steeper gradients in the polymer segment density profile .",
    "this is then ultimately responsible for an enhancement of the polymer contribution to the curvature parameters in the case of strong adsorption .",
    "we end with a discussion of the limitations of our theoretical treatment .",
    "corrections to the curvature parameters were calculated to leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the leading correction to the segment density profile gives a modified density profile that varies on the scale of the bulk correlation length , as does the ground state dominance profile .",
    "one expects @xcite higher order corrections ( @xmath72 ) to give modifications to the segment density profile on the scale of the polymer s radius of gyration .",
    "although these higher order corrections dominate the segment density profile when @xmath152 , they remain subdominant when it concerns the curvature parameters since these are expressed in terms of integrals over the entire region of inhomogeneity .",
    "a subtle point concerns the dimensional dependence of our analysis .",
    "since all our results are derived within mean - field theory , it is implied that the critical exponents are those of a polymer system embedded in 4 dimensions . in our derivation of the curvature parameters we explicitly consider the geometry to be that of a 2-dimensional surface curved in 3-dimensional space , which is arguably inconsistent with the mean - field assumption .",
    "it seems hard to avoid such an inconsistency , however , and it is a critique which applies to all mean - field calculations of curvature properties .",
    "the interaction with the solid surface is modeled by the extrapolation length @xmath21 giving an effective interaction .",
    "details of the structure of the wall ( e.g.  surface roughness , surface heterogeneity ) and the full wall - polymer interaction potential are therefore not explicitly considered .",
    "it is expected that these factors influence the polymer segment density in the very vicinity of the wall . in the present calculations ,",
    "the scale of the segment density profile is set by the bulk correlation length .",
    "one expects that the detailed structure of the wall is unimportant as long as the bulk correlation length is much larger than the microscopic length scale associated with this structure .",
    "formally , in the calculation presented the surface is taken to be that of an undeformable , attractive solid wall so that the main application of our results to experiments is for , say , polymer adsorption onto a colloidal particle .",
    "however , our results should also be of interest to the description of polymer adsorption on more flexible surfaces such as membranes @xcite , for which the essential physics is captured by the helfrich free energy .",
    "as a reference , we provide definitions of the special functions used .",
