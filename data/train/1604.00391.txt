    "the estimation of traffic flows over networks is a keystone for understanding their usage and behaviour in specific situations , e.g. , network has a limited capacity or traffic may significantly vary with time or with particular events . estimating traffic flows is thus needed for the network efficiency analysis , for traffic prediction , and traffic optimisation .",
    "origin - destination matrices ( odm ) estimation is one of the classical problem in transport engineering @xcite but also in the study of internet traffic @xcite .",
    "odm are double entry tables indexed by network zones or major nodes , whose elements contain the demand of traffic from origins indexed by rows , to destinations , indexed by columns . with respect to the transport field , odm can be recovered from traveller interviews directly .",
    "this is however a long , difficult and costly process .",
    "thus , since the 70 s and as a consequence of the generalisation , in occidental cities , of the access to link counts ( by magnetic / inductive loops ) , many researches have sought to estimate the odm with traffic counts as their primary source of data .",
    "* estimating odm from link counts . *",
    "formally , a road network is represented by a graph @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the corresponding odm , of size @xmath2 .",
    "magnetic loops , on links @xmath3 , produce @xmath4 measures represented by vector @xmath5 . thus , odm estimation problem amounts to solving the following inverse problem : @xmath6 where the assignment function @xmath7 relates od flows to network link , for comparisons against traffic counts @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 models the measurement error .",
    "the two main difficulties in solving problem stem , first , from its being ill - conditioned : the size of the quantity to be estimated @xmath1 is larger than that of the available measures @xmath5 and second , from @xmath7 being unknown and thus often modelled .",
    "to solve problem , a common approach is to rely on the so - called four - steps model , that consists of trip generation , trip distribution , modal split , and trip assignment .",
    "the first two steps permit to design @xmath1 while the assignment step , amounts to specifying @xmath7 .",
    "interested readers can refer to @xcite for more information on this framework .",
    "the use of this model requires a fine parameters tuning for the three steps .",
    "hence , a large literature can be found , with numerous variations for both trip distribution and assignment .",
    "a detailed review is beyond the scope of the present contribution , and interested readers are referred to e.g. , @xcite and references therein . +",
    "* goals , contributions and outline . * despite the fact that @xmath1 is of size @xmath10 , solving is in fact an inverse problem of size @xmath11 , because of the required assignment step that actually involves the number of links in the network .",
    "the goal of the present contribution is to directly account for the real dimensionality of the problem by proposing a new and original description tool for traffic , that directly includes assignment : the link dependent origin destination matrix ( lodm ) .",
    "lodm represents the od flows already assigned to each link of the network , thus incorporating the assignment , or equivalently making its independent specification unnecessary .",
    "we also propose to estimate lodm as an inverse problem of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "we rely on traffic counts @xmath8 and , in addition , on a new set of data : partial ( or sampled ) knowledge of trajectories , whose collection is now made possible by new technologies such as gps @xcite , bluetooth @xcite , floating car data @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : roadnetwork ] formalises the transport problem , from its engineering perspective .",
    "section [ sec : va ] details five significant properties imposed either by the network or for consistency with the observed data and turns them into five components of an objective function that formalises lodm estimation from traffic counts and sampled trajectories . because these five functions are convex but non necessarily differentiable , a proximal primal - dual algorithm is devised to minimize the corresponding optimisation problem results . to finish with",

    "the following notations are used throughout this article : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to vectors , matrices and tensors , respectively . the hadamard product ( element - wise product ) of @xmath15 and @xmath14",

    "superscript indices are used for dimensions over the links and the indexes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are favoured .    the symbol @xmath23 is used to denote the dimension that does not contribute to a sum : the sum over first and third dimensions , indexed respectively with @xmath17 and @xmath21 ,",
    "is written @xmath24 .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the element - wise first norm for matrices : @xmath26 .",
    "the network is described as a graph @xmath27 where the finite set of nodes @xmath28 models intersections of the road network .",
    "each node also defines a possible origin or destination .",
    "@xmath29 is the set of directed edges , each corresponding to a direct itinerary ( or road ) linking two nodes ( not going through another node in @xmath28 ) .",
    "the number of road users is denoted @xmath30 . a schematic ( small ) such graph",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sfig : network_example ] .",
    "on such a graph , lodm consists of a tensor of size @xmath31 , labelled @xmath32 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : network_example ] , each trajectory adds a count of 1 in @xmath33 if the link @xmath21 is on the origin - destination path @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 consists , for each link @xmath3 , in an od matrix of size @xmath10 .    to perform the estimation of @xmath35 , we use information stemming from probe trajectories as well as traffic counts on each link .",
    "the set of trajectories can be measured from various sources ( gps , bluetooth , ... ) and the actual technology matters little in the procedure .",
    "we propose here , though , to refer to the bluetooth technology , which is of great interest as it currently provides trajectory datasets with the highest penetration rate , compared to other technologies ; the penetration rate is the fraction of vehicles equipped with the chosen technology and from which information needed to reconstruct trajectory can be collected @xcite .",
    "trajectory information is stored into a tensor labelled @xmath36 , of size @xmath37 .",
    "this tensor can be read as a sampled version of @xmath35 , from only a fraction of the total traffic .",
    "traffic counts consists of the total volume of traffic on each link @xmath3 , labelled @xmath5 , of size @xmath38 , irrespective of od pairs .",
    "traffic counts can be , for instance , measured by magnetic loops .",
    "a variational approach will now be devised to estimate @xmath39 , the real lodm , by means of non - smooth convex optimisation from @xmath36 and @xmath5 .",
    "the involved criterion represents on the one hand the relationship between the tensor @xmath35 and the measures ( @xmath36 , @xmath5 ) and , on the other hand , properties of the road network and traffic constraints ( e.g. , car conservation at intersections ) .",
    "+      the structure of the graph is given by the _ incidence _ and _ excidence _ matrices denoted respectively @xmath40 and @xmath41 of size @xmath42 .",
    "these matrices describe the relations between the nodes and the edges , such that , for every @xmath43 , @xmath44    note that in graph theory , it is customary to name the difference @xmath45 as _ incidence matrix _ ; however we need both matrices separately in this work .",
    "let us also define the tensors @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 ) corresponding to the replication of @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) such that , @xmath50    using these notations , we relate the lodm @xmath35 to the classical od matrix @xmath1 of size @xmath51 where each element @xmath52 contains the traffic flow originating from the node @xmath17 and having @xmath18 for destination as follows :    @xmath53    we denote by @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) the _ origin _",
    "_ destination _ ) vector , of size @xmath56 as the sum of @xmath1 over the second ( resp .",
    "first ) dimension .",
    "it represents the flows originating ( or having for destination ) each node of the graph .",
    "formally ,    @xmath57      for this problem , we consider an urban road network composed of major roads , ignoring residential and service streets , seldom equipped with traffic sensors .",
    "the set of users with their trajectories on those major roads , are represented through the tensor @xmath35 , as described above and that we wish to estimate .    for this estimation , we first assume that every road is equipped with a magnetic loop , counting the number of cars using it .",
    "it implies therefore that every element in @xmath58 is known .",
    "this assumption is realistic in our case considering major roads only .",
    "the magnetic loops are usually subject to counting errors and it is modelled here by a noise @xmath59 .",
    "hence the measured quantity @xmath5 reads : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the true traffic volumes .",
    "second , we also assume that the proportion of bluetooth equipped vehicle can vary with each possible pair of od but that it does nt change along a trajectory ( the tracking devices are not turned off and on while the car is running ) .",
    "this assumption allows us to define an od - dependant penetration rate @xmath62 of size @xmath63 .",
    "experiments in brisbane have shown that the average bluetooth penetration rate is around 25% @xcite",
    ". moreover , @xmath36 appears as a noisy version of @xmath39 for which the noise level depends on the penetration rate .",
    "the relation between the tensors @xmath36 to @xmath39 can thus be modelled by a poisson law , typically involved in counting processes .",
    "this leads to a model @xmath64",
    "instead of using the traditional four - steps model resolution , iterating over a process involving _ a priori _ information , modelling of the traffic , estimating the variables of interest , comparing to the observed measures and tuning the models , we propose here the use of a variational approach .",
    "both our knowledge of the network and of the traffic states are included within an objective function that combines together five terms to be jointly minimised .",
    "the terms of the objective functions can be classified in three types : the first type , composed of functions [ sssec : trafficcount ] , [ sssec : bluetoothpoisson ] and [ sssec : definitiondomain ] , is aiming for consistency between the measures and the estimate .",
    "the second type , with function [ sssec : kirchhoff ] , stems from the topology of the network .",
    "the third and last type , with function [ sssec : tv ] , comes from an additional assumption based on our knowledge of transport networks .      ensuring the consistency with traffic counts would require that eq .",
    "is satisfied . noting that : @xmath66 and assuming a random unbiased gaussian noise @xmath59 for the magnetic loops , as in eq .",
    ", the constraint of eq can be released and leads to the following function :    @xmath67      second , the consistency with bluetooth measures , as modelled in equation requires the knowledge of the od - dependent penetration rate @xmath62 .",
    "this information , of size @xmath10 , is not directly available from @xmath5 and @xmath36 , therefore we introduce an approximation of this penetration rate of size @xmath38 , noted @xmath69 and calculated as :    @xmath70    the resulting data fidelity term , denoted @xmath68 , models the minus log - likelihood associated with the poisson model @xcite : @xmath71 where , for every @xmath72 , @xmath73      third , another term ensuring data consistency models that the total flow should be greater than the flow of bluetooth enabled vehicles .",
    "it consists thus in imposing that @xmath35 belongs to the following convex set @xmath75 : @xmath76 the corresponding convex function is the indicator function @xmath77 : @xmath78      this property is the classical law for flows on network , the kirchhoff s law , describing the conservation of cars at intersections .",
    "it takes into account the network topology .",
    "it requires that , for each od pairs and at every node , the number of cars is conserved when properly accounting for origins and destinations . for every origin @xmath80 , destination @xmath81 and node @xmath82 of the network , this yields to , @xmath83 this constraint",
    "can then be summarized as @xmath84 where the @xmath85 tensor @xmath86 is defined as @xmath87 it results in a convex function to be minimised : @xmath88    compared to our previous works @xcite , here the kirchhoff s law is applied per od pairs and not simply at a global scale .",
    "indeed , the kirchhoff s law needs also to be satisfied at each node , independently of the origin and destination of the cars . satisfying this global kirchhoff s law of @xcite is a consequence of the one used here .",
    "finally , from a transport perspective it seems realistic to assume that for two paths having close origins ( resp .",
    "destinations ) and same destination ( origin ) , the trajectories in the network should be correlated ( use of similar roads ) .",
    "such property can be written as @xmath90 in order to be used in a variational approach these relationships can be gathered within the convex function @xmath89 defined as the total variation : @xmath91 where @xmath92 models the neighbourhood of @xmath93 and where @xmath94 are positive weights on edges detailed later .",
    "the use of the @xmath95-norm is justified for its _ edge preservation _ properties .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in @xcite that the @xmath95-norm is adapted for cases where one seeks for spatial correlations while allowing some irregularities , _ edges _ , in image analysis . from a traffic perspective",
    ", we want to encourage users from similar origin ( resp .",
    "destination ) and with same destination ( resp .",
    "origin ) to use similar routes , but also want to allow some irregularities , for nodes in between two major roads where both could be a possible choice",
    ". those nodes can be interpreted as _",
    "edges _ in image analysis",
    ".    equation can further be simplified using a weighted effective incidence matrix , denoted @xmath96 , defined as @xmath97 and thus having a size @xmath98 , where each element @xmath99 denotes the weight for the link @xmath21 . for this work",
    "we choose the following vector @xmath100 of size @xmath101 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 models the length of the link @xmath21 and @xmath104 is the average distance of the nodes .",
    "for the simulated network : @xmath105 note that @xmath106 if @xmath21 is a link between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "eq . can then be rewritten as @xmath109 where @xmath110 models the @xmath21-th extracted matrix from @xmath35 .",
    "its dimension is thus @xmath111 .      to sum up",
    ", the objective is to find an estimate of @xmath39 satisfying @xmath112 where @xmath113 are positive weights applied to the objectives and model their relative importance within the global objective .",
    "all the five functions involved in eq .",
    "follow the usual assumptions required when dealing with convex optimisation tools : they are convex , lower - semicontinuous ( l.s.c . ) and proper . moreover",
    ", both the functions @xmath65 and @xmath79 are differentiable and their gradients are given below : @xmath114 and @xmath115 their lipschitz constants are denoted @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively @xcite .",
    "the other three functions however are not differentiable and @xmath89 involves a linear transformation @xmath118 such as : @xmath119 where @xmath118 satisfies : @xmath120 and whose adjoint is @xmath121 in the following , we denote @xmath122 the norm of this operator .",
    "for further details about the way to compute this norm , the reader can refer to @xcite .",

    "in such an iterative scheme , the non - differentiable functions are involved through their proximity operator @xcite defined as : @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes a real hilbert space and @xmath140 a convex , l.s.c . , proper function from @xmath139 to @xmath141-\\infty,+\\infty]$ ] . for further details on proximal algorithms",

    "to test and validate the proposed method , a simplified road network model has been created .",
    "this has been preferred to a real case study for three reasons : tractability , the possibility to access the ground truth and the opportunity to explore the behaviour of the method for varied conditions . however , the number of nodes , the connectivity , the number of users and their od patterns have been chosen to be consistent with those of a real networks .    the number of nodes of the simulated network is @xmath151 nodes .",
    "this number is kept relatively low to allow for a thorough exploration of the possible weights @xmath113 of problem . for comparison , the brisbane bluetooth scanner network has around @xmath152 intersections equipped with vehicle identification devices .",
    "other works on odm estimation consider often few tens of nodes ( @xmath153 od flows ) @xcite while very recent works considered up to @xmath154 nodes @xcite .    for the simulation",
    ", nodes are first located randomly on a grid and then links are created while aiming for an average connectivity of 6 , a value consistent with that of real road networks @xcite .",
    "this is done first , by means of a minimum spanning tree ( computed by the kruskal s algorithm @xcite ) , then , by adding links randomly to the nodes with lower degree ( sum of in and out edges ) provided that the added links do not cross or repeat an existing one .",
    "the number of users is fixed to @xmath155 .",
    "this leads to an mean flow per link of 3000 users . in big cities",
    ", it would correspond to around one hour of traffic during peak hours .",
    "each node @xmath17 has a probability @xmath156 of being an origin and similarly we define @xmath157 the probability of node @xmath18 to be a destination .",
    "thus @xmath158 and @xmath159 satisfy : @xmath160 an origin and a destination are randomly associated to each user , according to the probabilities @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "we simulate a preferred direction of travel , consistent with the trends observed in urban context ( mostly due to commuters ) . to this end",
    ", @xmath161 is decreasing linearly with the x - axis of the grid while @xmath162 is increasing linearly .",
    "the shortest path from origin to destination is then attributed to each user .    for each od",
    "pair , a bluetooth penetration rate is drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean 30% and standard deviation of 10% ( and truncated to be between 0 and 1 ) .",
    "this choice accounts for the variability of the ownership distribution of bluetooth devices ( which is not known ) from one node to another , depending , as an example , on the wealth of the neighbourhoods of the node .",
    "each user has a probability equal to the bluetooth penetration rate drawn for its od of being equipped with a bluetooth device .",
    "this gives us @xmath36 while the full set of trajectories gives @xmath39 for ground truth .",
    "the measured traffic flow per link @xmath5 is obtained from @xmath39 , assuming the addition a noise @xmath59 , for which each independent component is drawn from a gaussian distribution @xmath163 . for consistency with the noise usually measured on magnetic loops",
    "@xcite , we take @xmath164 .",
    "figure [ fig : simulatednetwork ] illustrates the simulated case study with total volumes on the links ( @xmath5 ) and the realisation of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for the @xmath165 users on the nodes .     on the links",

    ", the color distinguishes between origin ( blue ) and destination flows ( red ) and the diameter of the nodes is proportional to their value in @xmath158 and @xmath159.,width=302 ]      as discussed in section [ ssec : algo ] , the objective function depends on five parameters @xmath166 .",
    "it appears however that , as @xmath74 can only be @xmath167 or @xmath168 , exploring @xmath169 is enough .",
    "moreover , the minimum in equation is preserved by a linear operation over the four remaining parameters @xmath170 , and thus we choose @xmath171 .",
    "this would then correspond to two situations : with or without considering the data stemming from sampled trajectories in the estimation process .",
    "we then explore the space of positive real numbers for the three remaining parameters @xmath170 .    for those parameters",
    ", it has been observed that , for comparison purposes , it is justified to compare scenarii for rescaled values @xmath172 .",
    "indeed , @xmath173 depends on the setup , in particular on @xmath5 and @xmath36 .",
    "the algorithm stops if the convergence criteria is satisfied ( alg . [ algo : prim - dual ] ) or after @xmath165 iterations .",
    "the efficiency of the estimation algorithm is assessed by comparing its results to the ground truth @xmath39 with two indicators .",
    "first , we denote rmse the @xmath174 norm of the error divided by the norm of the ground truth ( rmse standing for root mean square error ) : @xmath175 second , emd refers to the earth movers distance @xcite , a metric often used for image or distribution comparisons .",
    "it corresponds to the minimal cost that must be paid to transform the histogram of one image or distribution into the other .",
    "we also provide a comparison of the estimates with two naive solutions denoted @xmath176 and @xmath177 , computed as the bluetooth lodm multiplied by the mean bluetooth penetration rate over the whole network ( @xmath178 ) , or over each link ( @xmath69 ) respectively , for every @xmath179 , @xmath180        solutions to problem have been explored through a systematic exploration of the @xmath113 values within the positive real numbers .",
    "figures [ fig : rmse_example ] and [ fig : emd_example ] illustrate the evolution of the criteria rmse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rmse_example ] ) and emd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : emd_example ] ) as a function of one @xmath113 , the others being fixed .",
    "it highlights the existence of sets of parameters @xmath113 for which the estimates have minimal criteria while being lower than the criteria of the naive estimates @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , in the following we denote by @xmath181 the estimate @xmath182 minimizing the rmse and by @xmath183 the one minimising the emd .",
    "that is : @xmath184    figure [ fig : histo ] represents the distribution of the elements in @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath181 , @xmath183 as histograms , superposed to the ground truth @xmath39 for comparison . as one could have expected from eq , @xmath176 contains only multiples of the penetration rate value @xmath178 .",
    "it has therefore a higher emd value than other estimates .",
    "for those four same estimates , table [ tbl : compsol ] presents the values for rmse , emd , @xmath65 ( consistency with observed counts ) and @xmath79 ( conformity with kirchhoff s law ) .",
    "these two functions are chosen because they are the most important from a transport perspective point - of - view .",
    "when applicable , the corresponding values for the @xmath170 are indicated .",
    "the table illustrates that @xmath176 is a good solution from a transport perspective as it has low values for @xmath65 and @xmath79 but is the worst performing when it is compared to the ground truth @xmath39 ( both for emd and rmse ) . on the opposite",
    ", @xmath177 has better rmse and emd values than @xmath176 but performs poorly on the relevant transport indicators .",
    "hence it is justified to actually solve problem as none of the naive solutions bring satisfying results . while doing so , both @xmath181 and @xmath183 give similar results in term of comparison to ground truth .",
    "as one might expect , their performances with respect to the transport indicators are consistent with the weights applied to the corresponding functions : the solution @xmath181 is reached for higher @xmath185 and , therefore , performs much better on the @xmath65 criterion while @xmath183 has a relatively higher @xmath186 and hence satisfies the kirchhoff s law better .",
    "the question of which solution is the best partly depends on the reliability of the link counts ( if the noise is high , satisfying perfectly @xmath65 might not be relevant ) .",
    "anyway , choosing between the two amounts to choosing the best @xmath113 , a question left for future work .     for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "note that the first point on the left is for @xmath189 , to be distinguished from the logarithmic scale from the second point and after.,width=302 ]     for @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "we have shown that the link dependent origin - destination matrix is an interesting tool for traffic representation .",
    "moreover we have evidenced that its estimation can be performed with a primal dual algorithm and that the objective function to be minimized can be partially derived from natural properties of the problem ( the consistency between measured and estimated traffic counts , the domain of definition and the kirchhoff s law ) . then by adding a few sensible relationships , as for example , the poisson sampling assumption and the similarities between nearby flows computed as the total variation , one can obtain from such method , estimates that outperform the naive solutions .",
    "however improvements can still be sought , especially by designing new functions .",
    "future works will demonstrate that , if available , traffic turn fractions at intersections can be involved as an additional term to achieve even better results .",
    "another trail for developing this problem is to look for an online algorithm as the one presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) .",
    "last , one could think about implementing time dependencies .",
    "this could be done by adding new relationships that would link successive estimations of the lodm or , alternatively , by using other methods : for example , a kalman filter similarly to what have been done on traffic counts based odm estimation @xcite , or also with supplementary data ( bluetooth @xcite or other sensors @xcite ) ."
