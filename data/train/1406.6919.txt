    "the outermost regular satellite of saturn , iapetus , has many odd features . among these",
    "are a drastic brightness contrast , whereby the trailing hemisphere is ten times brighter than the leading hemisphere @xcite , a shape consistent with a body spinning every @xmath016 hours despite its current rotation period of 79 days @xcite , and a prominent equatorial and nearly circumferential ridge that reaches heights of 20 km and is up to 70 km wide @xcite .",
    "this vast ridge system may have originated during a high spin rate period @xcite or may be the result of debris infall from an ancient impact - generated sub - satellite and/or ring system @xcite .",
    "the equatorial ridge is considered to be one of the most ancient features on iapetus because of its crater density , overprinting by basin ejecta , and the general lack of features that pre - date it @xcite ; yet the ridge has retained continuous undisturbed sections that are up to 200 km in length @xcite and nearly pristine peaks @xcite . despite its current semi - major axis of @xmath059 saturn radii , iapetus has many more impact basins per unit surface area than the interior mid - sized moons of saturn @xcite , which would have received more impactors due to gravitational focusing by saturn .",
    "hence , despite evidence of an intense bombardment across its surface , both the ridge and iapetus itself have avoided significant disruption during its bombardment history .",
    "the observed cratering and geologic record of iapetus can thus be used to constrain its and the saturn system bombardment history and provide constraints on dynamical simulations of planeteismal - driven migration during solar system formation .",
    "the `` classic '' _ nice _",
    "model for early solar system evolution suggests the giant planets formed in a tighter configuration and closer to the sun than their present locations @xcite .",
    "a solar system - wide instability was triggered when jupiter and saturn crossed their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance @xmath4 myr after planet formation @xcite .",
    "this produced a solar system - wide increase in the rate of impacts from icy and rocky leftovers of planet formation @xcite , similar in magnitude to that inferred from the observed number and clustering of ages of lunar impact basins and rocks , the so - called late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) @xcite .    in the classic _ nice _ model ,",
    "the timing of the lhb is strongly dependent on the mass of the disk and the location of the disk edge @xcite ; however , recent dynamical simulations including the effects of viscous stirring in the disk due to the presence of pluto - sized objects aim to resolve this sensitivity @xcite . in the ",
    "_ nice _ ii \" model @xcite , energy exchanges between the planets and a planetesimal disk containing about a thousand massive pluto - sized bodies cause an increase in the eccentricity of the inner ice giant , which leads the system to secular resonances that can initiate disk instability for a larger parameter space @xcite , removing much of the sensitivity to initial disk conditions .",
    "this new scenario predicts a slightly different bombardment history for the outer planet satellites than the classic _ nice _ model .",
    "namely , the presence of larger objects in the planetesimal disk increases the eccentricities of objects scattered onto the outer planet satellites .",
    "thus , a smaller number of cometary objects impact the icy moons , but with higher encounter velocities @xcite .    here , we compare results from a monte carlo model of impact cratering on iapetus to its recorded crater history @xcite , and the state of degradation of its ridge @xcite to constrain the total bombardment mass experienced by iapetus .",
    "we show that both the global cratering record and the persistence of the ridge suggest a similar bombardment mass of less than 20% than predicted by the classic _ nice _ model .",
    "this implies the ridge is ancient though we can not preclude delaying ridge formation up through the early lhb .",
    "our inferred bombardment mass range is consistent with recently proposed scenarios of planetsimal - driven migration and their predictions about the saturn system bombardment .",
    "_ voyager _ observations of the saturn system suggest the mid - sized icy moons of saturn were impacted by two populations @xcite .",
    "population i is characterized by large projectiles that are thought to be early impactors in heliocentric orbits , most probably comets .",
    "population ii lacks large impactors and is characterized by a high number density of small craters .",
    "this second population is thought to be younger since it dominates relatively young terrain on the inner mid - sized moons @xcite and may be produced by planetocentric debris launched into orbit by energetic impacts onto the icy satellites @xcite .",
    "alternatively , both measured populations may be a result of a single dynamically evolving population of heliocentric impactors @xcite .",
    "the _ nice _ model suggests the projectile source for the saturn system bombardment was the trans - neptunian disk @xcite , from which the kuiper belt formed @xcite . though the present - day size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) of the kuiper belt is well known ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is expected that the sfd of a collisionally - interacting population evolves over time due to collisional grinding .",
    "@xcite , though , based on inferences of the population of objects in the scattered disk and the oort cloud , suggest collisional grinding is negligible for the kuiper belt .",
    "their work suggest dynamical processes , which are size independent , need to be invoked to explain the mass depletion of the present - day kuiper belt with respect to expectations for total primitive mass .",
    "thus , the present - day sfd may be similar to the primitive size distribution in the disk @xcite .",
    "the size distribution of the objects striking the outer planet satellites may be similar to that of jupiter s trojans , which were also populated during the scattering event in the _ nice _",
    "model @xcite , and is similar to the kuiper belt @xcite .    here , we use a monte carlo model of global impact cratering @xcite to simulate the distribution of craters arising on iapetus .",
    "we investigate a variety of possible source populations and total bombardment masses in order to test if the size distribution of the kuiper belt can produce a cratering population similar to that measured on iapetus and provide constraints on the total bombardment mass .",
    "we use monte carlo methods to select a population of impactors consistent with the sfd of the kuiper belt , which generally follows a double power - law in mass ( @xmath5 ) of the form @xmath6 for impactor diameter @xmath7 km and @xmath8 for @xmath9 km . for the cold kuiper belt , @xmath10 and @xmath11 while for the hot kuiper belt , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the slopes for the small and large objects respectively @xcite .",
    "the break diameter for the cold and hot populations are @xmath14 km and @xmath15 km . for the trojan population , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 km @xcite . due to the resolution of our 3-d model @xcite ,",
    "the smallest impactor considered has @xmath19 km , thus , in contrast to @xcite , we consider a double power law . because , for all of the investigated source population sfds , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , most of the bombardment mass will be delivered by objects with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "thus our assumption of a double power law will not strongly affect our results .",
    "the total mass of objects striking iapetus ( @xmath23 ) is a free parameter that we vary in small increments between @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total bombardment mass predicted by the classic _ nice _ model .",
    "we extrapolate @xmath25 for iapetus based on estimates of the total amount of objects hitting callisto @xcite , and use the relative impact probabilities from @xcite , which are calculated using dynamical simulations of present - day ecliptic comets @xcite . for a 35@xmath26 planetesimal disk , callisto receives @xmath27  kg of icy material @xcite . the total impacting mass during a classic _ nice _ bombardment of iapetus is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are impact probabilities on iapetus and callisto respectively .",
    "@xcite suggest impact probabilities on callisto and iapetus relative to jupiter of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus iapetus receives @xmath33 the total bombardment mass on callisto , which is @xmath34 kg .",
    "the size of a crater produced by a given impactor is estimated using a pi scaling law @xcite , where an impactor of density @xmath35 with velocity @xmath36 produces a transient crater of diameter , @xmath37 where @xmath38  kg  m@xmath39 and @xmath40  m  s@xmath41 are iapetus density and gravity respectively , and @xmath42 is impact angle , the distribution of which follows @xmath43 such that @xmath44 is the most common value @xcite .",
    "we assume a nominal impactor density of @xmath45  kg  m@xmath39 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "impact velocities are simulated following a rayleigh distribution about a mean value of @xmath46 = 8.5  km  s@xmath47 , where @xmath48  km  s@xmath47 and @xmath49  km  s@xmath47 are iapetus keplerian orbital velocity and escape velocity @xcite respectively , and @xmath50  km  s@xmath47 @xcite .",
    "our value of @xmath51 is somewhat higher than reported by @xcite ( @xmath51 = 6.1  km  s@xmath47 ) and @xcite ( @xmath51 = 7.4  km  s@xmath47 ) , and arises from increased eccentricities and inclinations kicked up in the disk by pluto - sized objects resulting in a larger @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "our global monte carlo cratering model ( see section 3 ) has @xmath53  km pixels such that the smallest simulated crater is @xmath54 km .",
    "the simple - to - complex transition crater diameter ( @xmath55 ) on iapetus is 4.52 km @xcite ; therefore , all simulated craters are in the complex regime . in this regime ,",
    "the transient crater diameter is related to the final observed diameter as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we ran 200 monte carlo simulations for each investigated bombardment mass and sfd pair .",
    "because cratering populations typically follow a power law @xcite , we find the best fit power law to the synthetic cumulative crater frequency for each run following @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of craters with diameters greater than @xmath59 per 10@xmath60 km@xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are fitting parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the average @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the suite of monte carlo runs is then recorded for each bombardment mass with standard error of the means to a 95% confidence .",
    "for our source population study , we investigate the sfd of the cold and hot kuiper belt and the trojan population within their observed uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we find that the synthetic crater populations are more strongly sensitive to @xmath64 , the small - object distribution , than to @xmath65 , the large - object distribution .",
    "this is because most of the impactors have small diameters , even though most of the total mass hitting iapetus is delivered by objects with diameters near @xmath22 , where the sfd slope break occurs .",
    "@xcite measure @xmath66 for 10  km @xmath67  km .",
    "we find that a @xmath64 of 1.7 , which is within error to the observed value of the cold kuiper belt and the trojan small - object population , produces a synthetic crater population with @xmath68 , which is within error to the iapetus measured value .",
    "our inferred small - object slope is in good agreement with the  iapetus scaled distribution \" developed by @xcite , which suggests @xmath69 .",
    "these results , though , primarily constrain the sfd of impactors striking iapetus , which is not necessarily equivalent to the original sfd of objects in the planetesimal disk . in our further simulations , we assume the impacting population follows an sfd with parameters of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , because these best reproduce the observed crater population .",
    "we then compare the crater density from our synthetic crater populations to the observed crater density on iapetus to constrain the total mass of objects hitting the satellite .",
    "figure 1 shows the cumulative sfd for iapetus @xcite with error following poisson statistics to 95% confidence .",
    "additionally , we plot the simulated crater density as a function of bombardment mass .",
    "our results suggest the number density of craters as a function of diameter on iapetus is best matched by @xmath72 , where the error arises from our monte carlo methods .",
    "accounting for the error in the measured crater densities extends the possible bombardment mass range to @xmath73 .",
    "iapetus cratering , though , may be saturated and thus its crater density may not be fully representative of the total incident bombardment mass ; however , we note the inferred mass is valid even for large crater diameters , which will not be affected by saturation .",
    "the continuity of the equatorial ridge on iapetus and its degradation state can provide an additional constraint on the amount of objects that hit the satellite during its bombardment history . additionally ,",
    "when compared with the inferred global total bombardment mass , can also help elucidate ridge formation timing . to remain consistent with observations ,",
    "the ridge must retain a nearly pristine shape across long continuous sections @xcite .",
    "for the inferred production population s sfd , we find the average impactor radius is @xmath74  km with a characteristic impact velocity of @xmath75  km  s@xmath47 , which produces a crater with transient diameter of @xmath76 km .",
    "this covers only a small fraction of the surface of iapetus , @xmath77 ; however , the characteristic number of impacts is large , @xmath78 , where @xmath79  kg and @xmath80  km is the mass and radius of iapetus respectively , assuming the imapctors have the same density as iapetus @xcite .",
    "thus , a classic _ nice _ model bombardment ( i.e , @xmath81 ) would excavate a region on iapetus @xmath82 , @xmath83 which is approximately 2.7 times .",
    "this would significantly disrupt the ridge . for @xmath030% of the ridge to retain its triangular shape @xcite , @xmath84 , which implies @xmath85 .",
    "this simple analytical estimate gives a total bombardment mass that agrees with results from our cratering study ; however , this calculation does not account for overlapping impacts or the expected latitudinal distribution of craters , and so is an overestimate .      here",
    "we adapt our three - dimensional global monte carlo model of impact cratering @xcite to simulate impact - induced erosion of iapetus ridge .",
    "iapetus is modeled as a cartesian sphere discretized into cubic volume elements 5  km on a side .",
    "the sizes , velocities , and impact angles of projectiles hitting the sphere are chosen using the same monte carlo methods described in section 2 .",
    "impact locations are chosen randomly in longitude and latitude ( @xmath86 ) following @xmath87 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the ridge to be a feature centered at the equator that extends @xmath88 in latitude .",
    "the study of ridge topography by @xcite used images from only a single hemisphere of iapetus , the dark terrain , where topography is most readily estimated from images ; therefore , we analyze the fate of the ridge in only one hemisphere , which is randomly selected for each monte carlo run .    for every run , we take consecutive latitudinal slices with width of 5  km ( @xmath89 in longitude ) , at the model resolution , and test if a crater impinges on that slice . if so , we consider that the ridge has lost its triangular shape in that slice  this is the maximally conservative approach and results in lower bounds on disk mass estimates . for every monte carlo simulation ,",
    "we record the fraction of the ridge that is unmodified by impacts and find the average fraction over the suite of runs for each bombardment mass studied .",
    "the study of @xcite also finds that triangular peaks , the dominant observed morphology , composes @xmath90 of each 12@xmath1 longitudinal bin .",
    "@xcite find that segments of pristine ridge can be up to 200 km long @xcite .",
    "thus , significant continuous sections of the ridge within the dark terrain have avoided major modification by impacts .",
    "we test the continuity of the ridge by dividing the studied hemisphere into 12@xmath1 bins ( i.e. , @xmath91  km segments ) . for every bin",
    ", we find the number of non - impacted five kilometer - wide slices .",
    "if this value falls within the observed range of 20% - 42% , the bin is considered to match observations . for each monte carlo run",
    ", we find the percentage of successful bins , @xmath92 .",
    "values of @xmath23 that yield @xmath92 close to 1 are considered to be consistent with the observed ridge morphology .",
    "figure 2 shows an example post - bombardment map of iapetus depicting the number of times a @xmath53  km area on the surface is excavated by a transient crater cavity for a single impact history with @xmath81 . for this simulation , an area",
    "is excavated a maximum of 10 times with an average of @xmath93 times .",
    "we find that @xmath94 of the ridge survives impact modification . therefore ,",
    "as predicted by our analytic model , a classic _ nice _ bombardment disrupts the ridge to an extent far greater than observed .    the percent of the ridge that remains unmodified by impacts as a function of @xmath95 is shown in figure 3a .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath96 of the ridge remains unmodified by impacts when @xmath97 , in agreement with our analytic approach . in figure 3b ,",
    "the probability of a successful simulation that produces a ridge consistent with observations is plotted as a function of total bombardment mass .",
    "we consider the continuity criterion satisfied for a given @xmath23 when the resulting @xmath92 is indistinguishable from the peak point , which occurs for @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we infer a bombardment mass range of @xmath99 . above @xmath100 , too much of the ridge is damaged , while for bombardment masses less than @xmath101 , too much of the ridge survives .",
    "the global cratering record of iapetus suggests it suffered a total bombardment mass in the range of @xmath73 .",
    "the continuity and degradation state of the equatorial ridge suggests this feature experienced a total bombardment mass in the range of @xmath99 .",
    "thus , both the global cratering record of iapetus and the degradation state of the ridge suggest similar bombardment masses , intersecting at @xmath102 .",
    "because of the similar implied masses , our results suggest the ridge is one of the most ancient features on iapetus , in agreement with geological observations @xcite ; however , we can not preclude the possibility of delaying ridge formation to sometime during the lhb , which may occur if the ridge formed by debris infall from a ring @xcite .",
    "this is because there exists the possibility iapetus itself may have experienced @xmath103 while the ridge may have experienced @xmath104 .",
    "our results suggest iapetus experienced a smaller bombardment mass than predicted by the classic _ nice _",
    "model @xcite .",
    "there are several possible explanations .",
    "the planetesimal disk mass could have been smaller than the @xmath105 advocated in the classic _ nice _ model .",
    "alternatively , iapetus could have accreted late in solar system history , missing much of its early bombardment .",
    "indeed , recent work suggest some of saturn s moons may have been collisionally disrupted during the lhb and re - accreted afterwards @xcite ; however , the probability of disrupting iapetus at its present location during an lhb sourced from a @xmath105 disk is @xmath106 @xcite , this value is much smaller considering our inferred @xmath23 . indeed , iapetus is suggested to have formed concurrently with saturn @xcite .",
    "on this basis , we favor the interpretation that , in the classic _ nice _ scenario , the planetesimal disk mass is smaller . the initial planetesimal disk mass considered in @xcite of @xmath107 results in a total of @xmath108  kg of material delivered to iapetus ( see section 2.1 ) ; thus , our results would suggest a planetesimal disk mass of @xmath109 .    in the recent dynamical simulations for solar system formation , the so - called _ nice _ ii model @xcite and  jumping jupiter \" @xcite , a smaller bombardment mass is predicted for the outer satellites @xcite .",
    "this is because the scattered planetesimals are more excited ( i.e. , highly eccentric and inclined ) resulting in higher encounter velocities with the planets .",
    "the higher kinetic energy of the planetesimals result in the difficult capture of these bodies via gravitational focussing ; thus , less material impacts the planets and their satellites .",
    "a planetesimal disk mass of @xmath110 leads to a total bombardment mass on the order of @xmath103 on iapetus @xcite .",
    "thus , under the solar system architecture suggested in these dynamical simulations , our results imply a planetesimal disk mass of @xmath111 .",
    "this is in agreement with the planetesimal disk mass required to reproduce the jupiter trojan population , which suggests @xmath112 @xcite , and @xmath113 suggested by @xcite in their broad statistical study .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath114  km  s@xmath47 , consistent with planetesimals with eccentricities and inclinations excited due to gravitational interactions between icy planetesimals and pluto - sized objects embedded in the disk @xcite .",
    "if other scenarios predict significantly higher or lower @xmath52 , the constraints on disk mass would be adjusted slightly to account for variations in the transient crater diameter arising from faster or slower impactor populations .",
    "the production population on iapetus is suggested to be similar to the jupiter trojans and kuiper belt and to be sourced from the trans - neptunian disk @xcite .",
    "our results suggest the production population incident on iapetus has a similar sfd to the cold kuiper belt and trojan population .",
    "the sfd of the kuiper belt is suggested to only have undergone dynamical depletion , which is size independent , and so its present - day distribution should be similar to the primordial sfd @xcite .",
    "hence , our results support dynamical simulations and suggest the iapetian production population , and by extension that of the saturn system , is the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "additionally , our inferred sfd and @xmath23 are able to reproduce the basin crater density on iapetus . the measured cumulative basin crater density on iapetus for @xmath115  km is @xmath116  km@xmath41 , which is a total of 9 basins @xcite .",
    "the bombardment mass that best replicates this crater density is @xmath117 .",
    "assuming average impact characteristics such that @xmath75  km  s@xmath47 and @xmath44 , and that @xmath118 , the total impacting mass required to produce these basins is @xmath119  kg , which is @xmath120 of the total inferred incident bombardment mass .",
    "iapetus , the outer most regular satellite of saturn , is suggested to have formed concurrently with its parent body @xcite , and have avoided collisional disruption @xcite .",
    "additionally , the unrelaxed nature of its basins relative to the interior moons suggest it did not undergo a significant thermal history @xcite .",
    "therefore , iapetus is expected to have recorded the full outer system bombardment . among its perplexing features ,",
    "the two - toned moon of saturn contains a prominent , semi - continuous equatorial ridge , the geology of which suggests it to be one of the most ancient features on iapetus @xcite . the ridge , though , has retained long continuous sections and distinct sharp peaks @xcite despite the significant impact erosion predicted for this saturnian moon .",
    "the recorded cratering record of iapetus and the geology of its ridge can thus be used to constrain the saturnian bombardment history and provide bounds for solar system formation models .    here , we use the recorded crater population of iapetus @xcite and the degradation state of its equatorial ridge @xcite , to investigate the total bombardment mass the satellite experienced .",
    "we find the cratering record of iapetus supports an impactor population with a size distribution consistent with the cold kuiper belt and trojan population .",
    "the total mass of objects striking iapetus is 4% - 20% less than predicted by the classic _ nice _",
    "model @xcite . the well - preserved triangular shape of iapetus equatorial ridge and its long continuous segments",
    "suggest it experienced only 7% - 30% of the classic _ nice _ bombardment mass .",
    "therefore , our results suggest the possible bombardment mass experienced by iapetus lies between @xmath121 , or a total mass @xmath122  kg .    in the framework of updates to the _",
    "model @xcite , our results suggest a planetesimal disk mass of @xmath3 .",
    "this range is in agreement with constraints from the total mass of jupiter trojans , which suggest @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "our results are also consistent with constraints on the total bombardment mass arising from limits on impact - induced ice loss , which suggest the lhb delivered less than 10% of the classic _ nice _ bombardment mass @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest @xmath123 in order for both callisto and titan to retain their present - day moment of inertia .",
    "the higher @xmath52 predicted by @xcite would likely have a small effect on these constraints because callisto and titan are deeply embedded in their parent planets hill spheres , so @xmath52 plays less of a role in controlling @xmath51 than it does for iapetus .",
    "therefore , our results not only reproduce the cratering record of iapetus and the degradation state of its ridge , but are in agreement with a vast array of observations .",
