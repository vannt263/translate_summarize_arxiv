    "the _ riccati equations _ @xcite , namely the differential equations . this condition does not change our main results and it only makes some proofs unnecessarily more technical . ] @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 being arbitrary @xmath8-dependent real functions , play a very relevant rle in physics and mathematics @xcite . despite its apparent simplicity , the general solution of a riccati equation for arbitrary @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 can not be obtained by quadratures @xcite .",
    "this has led to devise many methods to solve them ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the general solution , @xmath11 , of a riccati equation ( [ riccr ] )",
    "can be brought into the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 are different particular solutions to ( [ riccr ] ) and @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to analyse the general solution of a riccati equation in terms of just three particular ones .",
    "for instance , it follows from ( [ sup ] ) that all particular solutions to a riccati equation are periodic if and only if the riccati equation has three periodic particular solutions .",
    "additionally , ( [ sup ] ) enables us to simplify the numerical analysis of riccati equations @xcite .",
    "expression ( [ sup ] ) shows that riccati equations are lie systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , recall that a _ lie system _ is a nonautonomous ( @xmath8-dependent ) system of first - order ordinary differential equations whose general solution can be written as a @xmath8-independent function , the _ superposition rule _ , of a set of particular solutions and some constants @xcite . in view of ( [ sup ] ) , the general solution of ( [ riccr ] ) reads @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 the above expression is the most well - known example of nonlinear superposition rule @xcite .",
    "this turns riccati equations into lie systems .",
    "scheffers theorem @xcite establishes when a system of first - order ordinary differential equations in normal form is a lie system .",
    "it also states that every lie system amounts to a curve within a finite - dimensional lie algebra of vector fields : a _ vessiot  guldberg lie algebra _ @xcite .",
    "lie proved that every such a lie algebra on the real line is locally diffeomorphic around a generic point to a lie subalgebra of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this explains geometrically why the general solution of a riccati equation can be expressed in the form ( [ sup ] ) .",
    "several generalisations of the riccati equations have appeared over the years @xcite .",
    "for instance , research has been performed on the complex riccati equations @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath10 being arbitrary complex @xmath8-dependent functions .",
    "some works have been devoted to studying their periodic solutions @xcite and applications in physics @xcite .",
    "riccati equations were lately generalised to the realm of quaternionic numbers @xmath21 by defining @xcite : @xmath22 in this case , @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 are arbitrary @xmath8-dependent quaternionic - valued functions .",
    "these equations have been studied mathematically in @xcite .",
    "other quaternionic generalizations of riccati equations have found applications in fluids physics and reducing multidimensional schrdinger equations @xcite .",
    "as far as the authors know , we here provide the first physical application of ( [ ricch ] ) by showing that these equations appear in the so - called quaternionic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "particular cases of quaternionic riccati equations , e.g. linear ones , appear in @xcite .",
    "as riccati equations over @xmath24 and @xmath25 have quadratic terms , it is reasonable that their generalization to quaternions should also content such a term .",
    "since quaternions are not commutative , the quadratic term in ( [ ricch ] ) is not uniquely determined : we could also have @xmath26 or / and @xmath27 @xcite . a reason to use @xmath28",
    "is that ( [ ricch ] ) has an analytic extension to the one - point compactification , @xmath29 , of quaternions @xcite .    as a first main result",
    ", this work introduces a new generalization of riccati equations to the space @xmath30 of octonionic numbers : the _ octonionic riccati equations_. since the hurwitz theorem @xcite states that every finite - dimensional normed division algebra is isomorphic to @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath21 or @xmath30 and we have a natural embedding of normed division algebras @xmath31 , then octonionic riccati equations retrieve riccati equations over @xmath32 as particular cases .",
    "we prove that octonionic riccati equations are lie systems .",
    "the lack of commutativity of octonions leads to several other possible definitions of octonionic riccati equations , but we show that they do not lead to lie systems . as a by - product",
    "we demonstrate that the same occurs with the alternative definitions of quaternionic riccati equations proposed in @xcite giving rise to a second reason to define quaternionic riccati equations as in ( [ ricch ] ) .",
    "we define riccati equations over finite - dimensional normed division algebras ( nda riccati equations ) and we prove that they can be considered as sub - cases of conformal riccati equations .",
    "this leads to show that a riccati equation over a finite - dimensional normed division algebra @xmath0 admits a vessiot  guldberg lie algebra , @xmath33 , of conformal vector fields with respect to a euclidean metric and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 stands for the lie algebra of the indefinite special orthogonal group @xmath36 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "importantly , lie algebras @xmath37 are simple lie algebras @xcite and @xmath33 is the smallest common vessiot ",
    "guldberg lie algebra for all riccati equations over @xmath0 .",
    "these results are resumed in table [ tablevg ] .    since vessiot ",
    "guldberg lie algebras of nda riccati equations become extremely large , standard differential and algebraic methods for studying lie algebras , e.g. the killing form , become highly inefficient .",
    "instead , we use differential calculus over normed division algebras and conformal geometry .",
    "the fact that nda riccati equations are lie systems allows for the use of many techniques to describe their general solutions , superposition rules , constants of motion , geometric invariants , lie symmetries , etcetera @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that geometric techniques , e.g. symplectic , poisson , @xmath38-symplectic or jacobi structures , may be applied to study their properties @xcite .",
    "it is well known that riccati equations can be described as a projection of a linear system on @xmath39 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we extend this result to the octonionic riccati equations and find that they can also be extended to the octonionic projective line .",
    "a similar result applies for all nda riccati equations .",
    ".vessiot  guldberg lie algebras for nda riccati equations .",
    "we write @xmath40 for the finite - dimensional lie algebra of conformal vector fields of the euclidean space @xmath41 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]        additional vector fields",

    "consider the linear space @xmath47 of linear vector fields on the coordinates @xmath48 . each @xmath49 act on @xmath50 as an @xmath24-linear operator with matrix @xmath51 in the basis @xmath52 .",
    "this gives rise to a lie algebra isomorphism @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "if @xmath51 is traceless , we will say that @xmath54 is traceless . in view of the coordinate expressions given in table [ table1 ] , the @xmath55 , @xmath56 are antisymmetric matrices for @xmath57 . as @xmath58 is a lie algebra isomorphism and the @xmath59 and their successive lie brackets span @xmath60 in view of lemma [ lemcon ] ,",
    "then the space @xmath61 consists of antisymmetric matrices spanning a subspace isomorphic to @xmath62 .",
    "this lie algebra is a maximal lie subalgebra of @xmath63 .",
    "the addition of any other element of @xmath63 to @xmath62 causes that the new subset can only be contained in the lie algebra @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . similarly , since @xmath58 is a lie algebra isomorphism , the addition of any new traceless vector field to @xmath64 causes that the resulting space can only be contained in the lie algebra of traceless linear vector fields .",
    "the lie brackets of the vector fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 generate linear traceless vector fields associated to not antisymmetric matrices .",
    "so , the vector fields associated to ( [ extricc ] ) generate all linear traceless vector fields .",
    "additionally , since @xmath67 is not a traceless vector field , the vector fields related to ( [ extricc ] ) generate all linear vector fields .",

    "the latter vector fields generate vector fields with coefficients which are polynomial with an arbitrary degree .",

    "it is straightforward to particularise the above proposition for quaternionic riccati equations .",
    "let us finally remark that octonionic riccati equations do not cover all conformal riccati equations related to riemannian metrics on @xmath75 .",
    "octonionic riccati equations demand only 14 linear traceless vector fields to be described , namely @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that its definition only contains 14 @xmath8-dependent coefficients .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath78 appearing in conformal riccati equations has 28 independent @xmath8-dependent entries .",
    "thus , octonionic riccati equations give rise to a subcase of conformal riccati equations .",
    "nevertheless , lemma [ lemcon ] states that the traceless vector fields in the octonionic riccati equation generate a lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath62 , which has dimension 28 .",
    "hence , octonionic riccati equations and conformal riccati equations over @xmath75 share the same vessiot  guldberg lie algebra for generic coefficients .",
    "it is well known that riccati equations can be extended to the real projective line @xmath79 . moreover ,",
    "particular solutions to riccati equations can be obtained from particular solutions to associated linear systems @xcite .",
    "the same results can not be so easily generalised to quaternions and octonions because they are non - associative and non - commutative , respectively . in this section , we will review the geometric approach to riccati equations and we will extend such an approach to general normed division algebras .    let us survey above mentioned known results on riccati equations over the reals . consider the system on @xmath39 of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are arbitrary @xmath8-dependent real functions .",
    "we can retrieve the riccati equation from the above system in the following way .",
    "define the surjective mapping @xmath83 , with @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath85 is a particular solution to ( [ linric ] ) within @xmath86 , then @xmath87 satisfies @xmath88 so every particular solution to system ( [ linric ] ) originates a particular solution to the above riccati equation . since @xmath89 is surjective , every solution to a riccati equation can be obtained from a particular solution of ( [ linric ] ) with @xmath90 .",
    "let us describe the above results as a particular case of a more general geometric procedure describing the linearisation of quaternionic riccati equations and their extension to a projective quaternionic line .",
    "next , the procedure will be generalized to octonions in a nontrivial way .",
    "the generalization of system ( [ linric ] ) to the quaternions looks like @xmath91 for @xmath92 and the @xmath8-dependent functions @xmath93 @xmath94 taking values in @xmath21 .",
