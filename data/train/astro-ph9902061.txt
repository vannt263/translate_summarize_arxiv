    "dust grains play an important role in the physics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the thin disks of galaxies , affecting the heating and cooling of the gas , the phase structure of the medium , the distribution of metals , and the transfer of radiation . while the processes that are thought to circulate matter between the thin disks and halos of spiral galaxies will operate on both gas _ and _ dust , the dust content of interstellar thick disks and halos",
    "is poorly understood . in our own galaxy",
    "there is evidence from gas - phase abundances that individual h@xmath12i  clouds at relatively large distances from the plane contain dust ( sembach & savage 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , these results give us little information on the distribution of dust with distance @xmath3  from the galactic midplane .    in an earlier paper we presented high - resolution optical images of the nearby galaxy ngc  891 taken with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope ( howk & savage 1997 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "these images reveal extensive amounts of highly - structured dust seen in absorption against the background stellar light of the galaxy .",
    "these dust structures , observable to heights @xmath13 kpc from the midplane , are seen along the entire length of the galaxy covered by the images presented in paper  i. we tentatively associated this dust absorption with the thick disk of interstellar material observed in other wavebands .",
    "an overly simple analysis of the radiative transfer , coupled with gas - to - dust relationships appropriate for the disk of the milky way ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) , suggests these dust structures are relatively opaque ( @xmath14 to 2.0 ) with correspondingly large gas column densities ( @xmath15 atoms @xmath16 ) and masses ( @xmath17 to 10@xmath18 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "estimates for the potential energies of the observed dusty clouds relative to the midplane are in the range @xmath19 ergs , similar to the energy estimates derived for galactic supershells ( heiles 1979 ) .",
    "the implied total gas mass associated with the ensemble of dusty high-@xmath3  clouds is roughly similar to that estimated for the mass of the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) in ngc  891 ( @xmath20 m@xmath9 ; dettmar 1990 ) .",
    "while there are uncertainties in these order of magnitude estimates , the images presented in paper  i  clearly show that a substantial amount of dust is present in the thick disk of ngc  891 .",
    "how common is this phenomenon of extraplanar dust ?",
    "is it a peculiar feature of one galaxy , or is there evidence in the local universe that thick disk dust is a common feature of spiral galaxies ? in this paper we try to partially answer these questions .",
    "we have undertaken a small imaging survey of edge - on galaxies within @xmath21 mpc using the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "our sample is limited to northern - hemisphere galaxies with inclinations @xmath22 from the plane of the sky , though after obtaining our images , some of these galaxies seemed less highly inclined .",
    "table [ table : galaxies ] gives a summary of the properties of our imaged galaxies .",
    "the properties listed in table [ table : galaxies ] are taken from ned , except for the distances which are from tully ( 1988 ) mpc from teerikorpi _ et al . _  ( 1992 ) ] .",
    "for each of these galaxies ( with one exception ) we have obtained 900s band  images .",
    "not all of the imaged galaxies are appropriate for the present work given the aforementioned inclination problems .",
    "we have exluded such galaxies from our `` final sample . ''",
    "we also limit this final sample to only massive @xmath4 galaxies to avoid problems with large changes in the gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "we will show in this paper that the presence of highly - structured dust at large heights ( @xmath23 pc ) from the midplane is a relatively common phenomenon and seems to be correlated with the presence of extraplanar dig .",
    "in  [ sec : observations ] we give the details of our observations and reductions ;  [ sec : unsharpmask ] discusses our image display , particularly our approach to producing unsharp masks to more clearly reveal dust structures .",
    "our primary observational results are given in ",
    "[ sec : results ] . in  [ subsec : individual ]",
    "we briefly discuss important properties of each of our target galaxies and give reasons for exluding particular galaxies from our final sample .",
    "a discussion of the implications for the origins of high-@xmath3  dust and for other observations of edge - on spirals is given in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , and we summarize our main conclusions in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "all of the observations presented here were obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the wiyn imager in use at the time of our observations is a thinned 2048@xmath242048 stis ccd with 21 @xmath25 m pixels .",
    "placed at the f/6.5 nasmyth focus of the wiyn telescope each pixel corresponds to @xmath26 on the sky .",
    "the imager has a @xmath27 field of view .",
    "the images presented here were taken under non - photometric conditions , though the seeing conditions were generally good .",
    "a log of our observations for each galaxy is given in table [ table : log ] .",
    "this table shows for each image the filter used , the date of observation , and the seeing - limited resolution for that exposure , expressed as the fwhm ( in arcseconds ) of gaussian fits to the stellar images using the iraf routine imexam .",
    "also given is the linear resolution of our observations at the assumed distance of each galaxy ( see table [ table : galaxies ] ) . with one exception this survey",
    "is based upon 900s exposures of each galaxy in the harris b  and  filters available at wiyn . for the galaxy ngc  4013",
    "we include only a 600s v - band exposure .",
    "the images have been bias - subtracted and flat field - corrected in the usual manner within iraf .",
    "the flat fields were derived from observations of the `` great white spot '' in the telescope dome .",
    "we do not have multiple exposures with which to correct for cosmic - ray contamination , with the exception of the v - band data for ngc  4565 , but this does not seriously affect our results .    in principle subtle variations in the flat - field of the image could mimic dust absorption in our target galaxies .",
    "however , the vast majority of the dust features we observe can not be referred to as `` subtle . ''",
    "the imprint of small scale features in the ccd flat - fields is relatively constant within a given night , allowing us to search for features common to all galaxies that might be instrument related .",
    "our experience suggests that the small - scale features present in the flat - field are usually not significant compared with the structures we are studying and are well removed in even single exposures . for our deeper imaging of a few galaxies ( howk & savage 1999a , b )",
    ", we have taken exposures with the target galaxies shifted to different parts of the imager to avoid complications associated with flat - fielding errors . comparing the final images with the individual frames , we are able to assess the probability of confusing flat - field structures with dust structures within these galaxies ; we have found no real evidence for confusion of flat - field features with absorbing dust structures .",
    "figures [ fig : n891][fig : n5907 ] present the final results of our imaging work . for each galaxy",
    "we show the v - band image and an unsharp masked version of the v - band data .",
    "since the main results of our survey depend on our ability to effectively display our images , it is worth discussing in detail our approach .",
    "we depend on unsharp masks of the v - band data to show the wealth of structures that are present in many of these galaxies .",
    "a good example of the advantages to unsharp masks is figure [ fig : n891 ] , which shows our images of ngc  891 .",
    "the v - band image ( bottom panel ) is displayed to show the distribution of light along the entire length of the galaxy . with this display",
    "the light from the bulge is saturated and shows little in the way of distinguishable dust features .",
    "however , the unsharp mask of the v - band data ( top panel ) allows us to show the absorbing structures along the entire length of the galaxy in one display .",
    "this display more accurately shows the complexity of the absorbing structures that thread through the bulge area .",
    "the unsharp mask of an image was derived by dividing the original image by a version smoothed with a gaussian kernel .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian used to produce the smoothed image was 15 pixels ( @xmath28 ) for galaxies closer than 10 mpc and 7.5 pixels ( @xmath29 ) for galaxies at greater distances ( see table [ table : galaxies ] ) . with this approach",
    "we remove the large - scale gradients in the background light of the galaxy , allowing us to display all parts of the galaxy in a uniform manner .",
    "the procedure tends to accentuate structures on scales smaller than smoothing kernel ( @xmath30 pc for our galaxies ) .",
    "this can be both an advantage and disadvantage .",
    "most of the structures we find in these galaxies have minor axis scales similar or smaller to this , though not all ( see  [ subsec : features ] ) .",
    "in some sense this offsets the natural tendency to have one s eye drawn towards very large structures .",
    "although we tend to identify structures only in computer displays of the science images ( i.e. , not the unsharp masks ) , the reader s eye may be drawn to the more small - scale structure in our unsharp masks .",
    "bright stars near a target galaxy can produce large artifacts in unsharp masks of images , destroying information over a disproportionately large area .",
    "we have produced our unsharp masks by dividing the original data by a smoothed image with such problem stars replaced by a two dimensional fit to the surrounding background light before the smoothing process . in a few cases we have also removed bright cosmic rays in the same manner .",
    "the replaced area is usually chosen to be a circular aperture of several times the fwhm of the seeing disk . for fainter examples , the aperture radius was typically twice the size of the seeing disk , while the brighter stars required apertures often in excess of five times the fwhm of the seeing disk .",
    "we have also removed the effects of ccd blooming from a few bright stars ( e.g. , figures [ fig : n891 ] and [ fig : n4217 ] for ngc  891 and ngc  4217 , respectively ) .",
    "this extra processing step to reduce the effects of bright stars has been limited to stars lying on or near the target galaxies . in a few cases foreground stars",
    "lay in front of the bright light of a galaxy bulge ; we have avoided removing stars in cases where the background to be fit comes from rapidly varying bulge light .    by dividing the original image by the smoothed image with bright stars and other features removed",
    ", we are able to keep bright stars from influencing large regions of the target galaxy , while at the same time showing where these stars lay with respect to the target .",
    "the latter point is important , because artifacts can be present in our unsharp masked images very near the position of a bright star .",
    "one can see examples of the detrimental effects of even relatively faint sources in figure [ fig : n4217 ] . in this image",
    "the stars well away from the galaxy have not been removed in the masking process , and therefore the unsharp mask process introduces the low - intensity halos surrounding many of the stars ( and background galaxies ) .",
    "even relatively faint stars in our image of ngc  4217 exhibit extended halos in the unsharp mask of our v - band image .",
    "however one can see in this image that the very bright star just north of the galaxy that was removed before the smoothing process does not show a large - scale halo .",
    "there are artifacts present near the edges of this star , but it does not overwhelm the galaxy as it does in unsharp masks produced without removing it from the image .    in general one should be wary of subtle features near point sources or even bright extended objects in our unsharp masks .",
    "a lesson to this effect is the image of ngc  4565 shown in figure [ fig : n4565 ] .",
    "this galaxy shows a relatively prominent bulge ( more so than most of the galaxies in our sample ) .",
    "the unsharp mask of the v - band image shows a faint halo coincident with the relatively sharp edge of the bulge light seen in the v - band image .",
    "faint , large - scale artifacts ( white in our unsharp mask ) can be seen where the bulge of the galaxy is brightest . in particular , an artifact is present just to the south of the dust lane where the bright center of the galaxy , whose emission changes on small length scales , dominates the light . within the bulge area itself",
    "there are point sources ( presumably foreground stars ) that are hidden by the light of the bulge in our v - band data .",
    "these have not been masked out , and seem to exhibit slight artifacts .",
    "ngc  4565 is a good example of artifact production in our unsharp mask procedure , since the galaxy has very little high-@xmath3  dust .",
    "we have been careful to avoid producing artifacts .",
    "this is part of the reason we use different size smoothing boxes for galaxies depending on their distances : we have found that this scale of smoothing produces the most reliable results .",
    "while there are possible problems associated with the interpretation of the unsharp masks displayed here , one can see that this approach is much more effective at showing the reader the true extent and complexity of the dust features we see at high-@xmath3  in many of these galaxies .",
    "it is immediately clear from figures [ fig : n891][fig : n5907 ] that many of the galaxies in our sample show evidence for dust above the central dust lane . only dust that is highly structured or significantly overdense relative to its surroundings is expected to be obvious in our images .",
    "thus there could be a smoothly - distributed component of dust at high-@xmath3  in all of these galaxies .",
    "for our purposes , we are interested in dust structures at heights @xmath31 pc , i.e. , well above the central absorbing dust lanes in these galaxies . for comparison the fwhm of the thin disk molecular gas is estimated to be @xmath32 pc in ngc  891 ( scoville _ et al . _",
    "1993 ) , @xmath33 pc in ngc  4013 ( garca - burillo , combes , & neri 1999 , but adopting our assumed distance of 17 mpc ) , and @xmath34 pc for the milky way ( e.g. , scoville & sanders 1987 ) .",
    "thus structures with heights @xmath31 pc should lie above most of the material associated with the thin interstellar disks of these galaxies . in paper",
    "i  it was pointed out that the optical identification of dust features such as those seen in our images is susceptible to a number of selection effects .",
    "we are much more sensitive to absorbing structures that lie preferentially on the near side of a galaxy . in paper",
    "i  we characterized dust structures at high-@xmath3  in ngc  891 by their `` apparent extinction , '' @xmath35 .",
    "we defined the apparent extinction in a waveband @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the surface brightness measured towards a dust cloud , and @xmath39 is the surface brightness of the local background .",
    "the light measured towards a given dust feature contains an extincted component of starlight originating behind the feature along the line of sight as well as an unextincted component emitted in front of the feature .",
    "the apparent extinction in the v - band , @xmath40 , is a lower limit to the true extinction , @xmath41 .",
    "an absorbing structure that has a very large @xmath41 with a large amount of unextincted stellar light lying between it and the observer can have a very small @xmath40 and show too little contrast to be detectable .",
    "we can not identify high-@xmath3  dust in galaxies with very thin stellar light distributions since we depend upon the background light of the stellar distribution to illuminate the dust in which we are interested .",
    "table [ table : dust ] summarizes our observational results , listing our observational sample in order of decreasing star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit area of the visible disk .",
    "this quantity is traced by the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity , @xmath42 , divided by @xmath43 , the square of the major axis diameter defined by a surface brightness contour of 25 mag .",
    "arcsec@xmath44 ( e.g. , rand 1996 ) .",
    "the fir luminosities are derived from the _ iras _",
    "60  and 100  fluxes ( fullmer & lonsdale 1989 ) .",
    "this tracer of the sfr of a galaxy is imperfect , however , given the contribution of the general interstellar radiation field to the heating of dust grains ( see rand 1996 for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "in particular the fraction of the fir luminosity that is a result of heating by the interstellar radiation field may be a function of hubble type ( see roberts & haynes 1994 , and references therein ) .    those galaxies that we have deemed appropriate to be included in our `` final sample , '' i.e. , massive @xmath4-like galaxies that are highly - enough inclined , are identified in table [ table : dust ] . in practice we do not use the observed visual luminosity of our target galaxies to determine whether or not they should be included in this final sample of luminous spirals given the possibly very important effects of extinction in these edge - on systems . instead we choose to use the observed h@xmath12i  velocity profiles of our targets as an indicator of their mass , and by extension their luminosity .",
    "table [ table : galaxies ] lists the velocity full - width at @xmath45 peak , @xmath46 , derived from the integrated h@xmath12i  profile for each of our target galaxies .",
    "these data are taken from the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ ( or rc3 ; de vaucouleurs _ et al . _",
    "we exclude galaxies from our sample if their rotation velocities ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) are less than 200 km  s@xmath48  at the @xmath49 level .",
    "where possible we have used the detailed rotation curves of galaxies rather than the integrated h@xmath12i  profiles of the galaxies from the rc3 in making this judgement .",
    "we comment in  [ subsec : individual ] on the reason(s ) for excluding an imaged galaxy from this final sample , giving references for the detailed rotation curves where appropriate .",
    "various well - studied edge - on galaxies have not made it into the current survey for one reason or another .",
    "well - known galaxies have often been excluded because they are too distant ( e.g. , ngc  5746 , ngc  5775 , and ugc  10288 ) , have inclinations @xmath50 ( e.g. , ngc  3079 , ngc  3556 , and ngc  5023 ) , are not spiral galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4762 ) , or have rotation velocities suggesting they are not massive @xmath4-like galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  3432 , ngc  4244 , ic  2233 , and m  82 ) .",
    "our selection by inclination is quite subjective in most cases . for galaxies that were close to the cut - off we have usually excluded them from this sample on the basis of short wiyn images .    for each galaxy",
    "we make a judgement : is there evidence for significant extraplanar dust or not ?",
    "table [ table : dust ] identifies those galaxies in our survey that show extraplanar dust with a @xmath51 symbol , and those that show little or no evidence for high-@xmath3  dust with a @xmath52 symbol .",
    "a few cases were ambiguous given their inclinations ( e.g. , ngc  4157 and ngc  4183 ) . also given in table [ table : dust ] is an indicator of the presence or absence of high-@xmath3  dig , where a search has been made , and the general morphology of the dig where present .",
    "references to the appropriate dig studies are given in the table .",
    "an immediate conclusion that can be drawn from table [ table : dust ] is that every galaxy in our sample that was previously known to have high-@xmath3  dig shows evidence for extraplanar dust and none of those lacking observable high-@xmath3  dig shows any evidence for extraplanar dust .    a large fraction of the galaxies in our sample shows evidence for high-@xmath3  dust .",
    "two cautionary comments are in order regarding our sample .",
    "the simpler of the two is that our sample size is quite small .",
    "we include seven galaxies in our final sample , five of which show extraplanar dust .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in a sample of this size are expected to be quite large . assuming a binomial probability distribution we find a formal result of @xmath53 of spiral galaxies in the local universe have highly - structured extraplanar dust . however , our second caution is that our sample , in all likelihood , is neither statistically complete nor unbiased .",
    "we have subjectively judged the inclination of the galaxies which have poorly - known inclinations and chosen only those that visually appear to have inclinations @xmath22 .",
    "we can not guarantee we have included all appropriate galaxies , though most large galaxies in the local universe ( outside of the zone of avoidance ) are probably known . to our knowledge",
    "our final sample contains all of the _ truly _ edge - on @xmath4-like northern spirals within 25 mpc .",
    "however , we are likely biased to large , well - studied galaxies , particularly those that have previously been searched for high-@xmath3  dig .",
    "another possibly important aspect of table [ table : dust ] is the non - uniformity of the observations of high-@xmath3  dig .",
    "even the individual galaxies within the larger surveys of rand ( 1996 ) and pildis , bregman , & schombert ( 1994 ) have varying sensitivities to h@xmath11  emission .",
    "though the searches for high-@xmath3  dig are not statistically rigorous , a picture has been developed based upon observations of more than 25 galaxies that couples the presence of dig at high-@xmath3  with the sfr of the underlying disk .",
    "and though not many galaxies show bright , widespread diffuse h@xmath11  emission at high-@xmath3 , like ngc  891 , many of the galaxies studied ( in the range of 60 - 70% ) show _ some _ form of high-@xmath3  dig ( e.g. , rand 1998 ; dettmar 1998 ) . however , the observations of this sample of galaxies are inhomogeneous .",
    "if we assume the presence of dust and ionized gas at high-@xmath3  in spiral galaxies is tied to the sfr , perhaps a more meaningful number might be the number of spiral galaxies with sfrs similar to those in our sample .",
    "galaxies with sfrs similar to ngc  4013 and ngc  891 are likely relatively common . for example , the milky way has a value of @xmath54 ergs s@xmath48 kpc@xmath44 ( cox & mezger 1989 ; see rand 1996 ) , which is midway between the values of this quantity for ngc  891 and ngc  4013 .",
    "the total @xmath42 of the galaxy is estimated to be @xmath55 ergs s@xmath48 , or @xmath56 @xmath57  ( cox & mezger 1989 ) .",
    "roberts & haynes ( 1994 ) have compiled a volume - limited sample of galaxies in the local supercluster culled from the rc3 for comparing the properties of galaxies along the hubble sequence . in their sample of sab ,",
    "sb galaxies they derive a median fir luminosity of @xmath58 \\times { 10^{9}}$ ] @xmath57 , where the numbers in parentheses give the the 25th and 75th percentile ranges .",
    "this median is based on a sample of 171 galaxies .",
    "their sample of 214 sbc , sc galaxies gives a median @xmath59 \\times { 10^{9}}$ ] @xmath57 .",
    "the median value of @xmath42 for both our full and final samples is @xmath60 @xmath57  ( using the upper limits as detections ) .",
    "these values are comparable to the fir luminosity distribution in the roberts & haynes sample , suggesting that our small sample of galaxies is not unusual compared with a larger sample in the local supercluster , at least as judged by the median values of @xmath42 .",
    "further , the fir luminosities of the individual galaxies in our sample are not extraordinary given the broad distribution of @xmath42 in the roberts & haynes sample .",
    "though @xmath42 is an imperfect measure , this suggests the sfrs in our target galaxies may also typical of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the presence of dust at large distances from the midplane can no longer be viewed as a peculiar property of a single galaxy ( e.g. , ngc  891 ) .",
    "our observations reveal that the existence of inhomogeneously distributed ( clumped ) high-@xmath3  dust is a common property of @xmath4-like spiral galaxies .",
    "we comment here briefly on the important properties of the individual galaxies in our sample .",
    "in particular we point out those galaxies that are not included in our final sample and describe why they were left out",
    ". we also comment on galaxies known to be interacting or in close groups , as well as those for which we have obtained more extensive wiyn imaging that will be presented in future works .    _ ngc 891  _ this galaxy has long been known to harbor extraplanar dust ( e.g. , sandage 1961 ; keppel _ et al . _",

    "we concluded in paper  i  that star formation , and the resulting energy input into the ism through radiation , stellar winds , and supernova explosions , must play a role in whatever process(es ) one imagines is responsible for the dusty thick disk of material in ngc  891 .",
    "that conclusion is strengthened in the current work by the striking correlation between the presence of high-@xmath3  dust and the detectability of thick distributions of dig in our sample of galaxies .",
    "extraplanar dig in galaxies has been studied more thoroughly than the dust structures we consider [ cf .",
    ", reviews by dettmar ( 1998 ) and rand ( 1998 ) , and references therein ] .",
    "the main finding of these works is a connection of the dig emission with the sfr of the underlying disk .",

    "observations ) .",
    "the correlation of high-@xmath3dig and dust found in the current work suggests that both phenomena must be ultimately tied to the same overall driving force , i.e. , star formation .",
    "the observed dust structures can not be due to gaseous warps in our target galaxies .",
    "we showed in paper  i  that the rough number of dust features was similar for each side of ngc  891 , which is not expected in the case of a warp along the line of sight ; a warp in the plane of the sky is ruled out from h@xmath12i  observations ( e.g. , swaters _ et al . _",
    "furthermore , the galaxies in our sample that do show prominent warps , ngc  3628 , ngc  4013 , ngc  4565 , and ngc  5907 , include two galaxies that show no evidence for substantial amounts of high-@xmath3  dust and two that show extensive high-@xmath3  dust ( see table [ table : dust ] ) .",
    "the influence of flared gas layers in our target galaxies is less easy to dismiss , i.e. , the observed high-@xmath3  dust could be due to flares .",
    "however , we do not believe this is the case .",
    "the morphologies of some features are highly suggestive of hydrodynamical shaping by star formation ( see paper  i ) , and the correlation presented here between high-@xmath3  dust and ionized gas also suggests a connection with the sfr of the disk .",
    "many of the galaxies containing dig at high-@xmath3  show either very patchy h@xmath11  emission , presumably associated with locally enhanced sfrs in the disk ( e.g. , above spiral arms ) , or thick disk dig layers that cut off sharply at a given projected distance from the galaxy center ( e.g. , rand 1996 ; dettmar 1990 ; rand _ et al . _  1990 ) .",
    "neither of these observational phenomena is explained if the dig at large projected distances from the midplane is due to a flared gas layer .",
    "we believe this argues against flares as an explanation for the thick dig layers of galaxies , and by extension against flares as an explanation for high-@xmath3  dust .",
    "the aforementioned coincidence of dust features in ngc  4013 with extraplanar co clouds ( garca - burillo _ et al . _  1999 ) at velocities incompatable with galactic rotation further suggests that at least some of these dusty clouds are not associated with a gaseous flare .",
    "though the high-@xmath3  ionized gas and dust observed in spirals seem to be highly correlated , we do not believe that they trace the same material .",
    "the clouds traced by dust , if they contain significant amounts of gas , must be denser than that traced by the general dig . in paper",
    "i  we suggest an approximate gas density regime for the extraplanar dust features is @xmath98 @xmath99 , assuming galactic gas - to - dust relationships . at @xmath100 kpc in ngc  891",
    "the expected average density of electrons associated with the dig is @xmath101 @xmath99  ( rand 1997 ) , with the true local density being perhaps @xmath102 depending on the filling factor . given our lower limits to the implied column densities of the features listed in table [ table : features ] , these structures would have to extend @xmath103 pc along the line of sight to have densities as low as the dig .",
    "in most cases this is a significantly larger extent than the observed dimensions in the plane of the sky .",
    "it seems unlikely that the structures we observe extend that far along the line of sight .",
    "work to be presented in a future publication (",
    "howk & savage 1999a ) suggests that not all of the absorbing dust features have associated h@xmath11  emission .",
    "if these high-@xmath3  dust clouds have gas densities as high as 1 @xmath99  and are ionized , they would have very large h@xmath11emission measures compared with the surrouding dig .",

    "@xmath16 , closer to those observed in this work , they find @xmath107 k @xmath99 .",
    "other factors are important for such considerations , including the strength of the interstellar radiation field and the gas to dust ratio ; in the case of the high-@xmath3material discussed here these factors all tend to decrease the minumum pressure required for a stable dense gas phase , with the exception of possible variations in the c and o abundances ( see wolfire _",

    "are the pressures at high-@xmath3  in our target galaxies sufficiently high to support a stable dense phase of the ism ? in the case of ngc  891 , the best studied of these galaxies , the answer is yes .",
    "observations of x - ray and h@xmath11  emission from ngc  891 have provided some information on the electron density distribution at high-@xmath3  ( bregman & houck 1997 and rand 1997 , respectively ) .",
    "bregman & houck ( 1997 ) characterize the x - ray emitting gas with a temperature @xmath108 k , central density @xmath109 @xmath99 , and a gaussian scale height perpendicular to the plane of @xmath110 kpc .",
    "the radial scale - length of this gas is thought to be @xmath111 kpc .",
    "thus the midplane pressure should be of order @xmath112 and half that value at @xmath113 kpc , @xmath114 kpc .",
    "even at @xmath115 kpc , comparable to the sun s distance from the galactic center , the expected pressure of the hot ism according to the bregman & houck fits should be @xmath116 k @xmath99 . thus if the observed dusty clouds are immersed in the hot gaseous halo of this galaxy at @xmath117 kpc , the pressures are much greater than those required by the wolfire _",

    "we find similar results if the clouds are embedded in the high-@xmath3  dig . at @xmath117",
    "kpc the average density of electrons in the thick ionized gas layer of ngc  891 should be of order @xmath118 @xmath99 , according to the distribution derived by rand ( 1997 ) .",
    "if we assume nebular temperatures for this gas , in this case @xmath119 k , and an ionization fraction @xmath120 ( rand 1998 ) , then we find @xmath121 k @xmath99  at @xmath117 kpc .",

    "et al . _",
    "1995b ) , the expected pressures at heights @xmath125 kpc in ngc  891 seem sufficiently high for the presence of a stable dense medium .",
    "note that non - thermal pressures may also be important .",
    "assuming the observed dust structures represent a dense phase of the ism at high-@xmath3 , one can estimate the thermal crossing times for these structures .",
    "this allows us to roughly estimate the expected lifetime of a cloud assuming no sources of confinement .",
    "rough estimates of the densities for our cloud structures , using our column density estimates and minor axis size scales , suggest densities of order @xmath126 @xmath99 . at pressures characteristic of the dig at high-@xmath3 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath127 k @xmath99 , this corresponds to temperatures of order @xmath128 k ( assuming pressure equilibrium ) , with lower temperatures being more likely if these structures truly represent a dense phase of the ism . if we assume minor axis sizes of order 100 pc , the thermal crossing times for this range of temperatures is of order @xmath129 years .",
    "this is similar to the expected circulation timescales for a parcel of gas travelling from the disk to halo and back ( e.g. , houck & bregman 1990 ; norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "the timescales may be longer than this if magnetic fields are present .",
    "this suggests that these structures are not simply transient , but could indeed be long lived .",
    "if the cool dust clouds are formed from thermal instabilities in the hot or warm ionized medium at high-@xmath3",
    "it implies that dust must survive in the dig and/or the hot gas .",
    "this is not an unreasonable scenario .",
    "howk & savage ( 1999d ) have recently shown that dust must exist in the warm ionized medium of the milky way based upon the gas - phase abundances of al and s. and while there is little observational information on the dust content of the hot ism , theoretical calculations suggest that grains are able to survive the thermal sputtering in such a harsh environment for as much as @xmath130 years ( ferrara _ et al . _  1991 ) .",
    "a scenario in which the observed high-@xmath3  dusty clouds represent the dense phase of a multi - phase ism at high-@xmath3 , like the models discussed in paper  i , requires a large star formation rate in the underlying disk to provide both the material at high-@xmath3  and the requisite pressure .",
    "thus fountain- or chimney - like outflows may cause a region of relatively high pressure just above the thin disk that can enable the formation of dense cloud condensations in the range of heights where we observe the absorbing structures considered in this work .",
    "if thermal equilibrium considerations drive the _ in situ _ formation of the observed dusty clouds at high-@xmath3 , a natural consequence of the large required pressure may be a large emissivity in the h@xmath11  line from the dig .",
    "the intensity of h@xmath11  emission from a parcel of gas is proportional to the product @xmath131 , or proportional to @xmath132 in a pure hydrogen gas , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the proton and electron densities , respectively .",
    "if we assume the dig exists within a range of temperatures @xmath135 k , the relatively large pressure required to confine the dense clouds is manifested in a large density , and hence fuels a large h@xmath11  emissivity .",
    "thus galaxies that have high-@xmath3  material with thick disk pressures large enough to support a dense phase of the ism may naturally be expected to show detectable h@xmath11  emission at high-@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting that many of the dust features we see in our target galaxies are of similar sizes and estimated masses to giant molecular clouds in the disk of the milky way . as we suggested earlier , the observed dust features may indeed contain molecular material , depending on the true gas to dust ratio and interstellar radiation field at high-@xmath3 . given this similarity",
    "it is possible stars may be presently forming from the high-@xmath3  material observed in many of our galaxies .",
    "indeed , we have found evidence for high-@xmath3  ( @xmath136 kpc ) h@xmath12ii  regions in ngc  891 and ngc  4013 ( howk & savage 1999c ) .",
    "these regions of ionized gas are presumably powered by early - type stars , though spectroscopy is needed to confirm the classification of these objects as h@xmath12ii  regions .",
    "such high-@xmath3",
    "h@xmath12iiregions have been noted by other authors for the galaxies ngc  4244 ( walterbos 1991 ) and ngc  55 ( ferguson , wyse , & gallagher 1996 ) . it would be worthwhile to carefully search for molecular emission ( e.g. , co ) at high-@xmath3  in the galaxies that do show these dust structures .      are there structures in the milky way that are comparable to those observed here ?",
    "this question is complicated by the difficulties of identifying structures given our position in the disk of the milky way .",
    "koo , heiles , & reach ( 1992 ) have identified galactic structures they term `` worms '' seen in both h@xmath12i  and _ iras _ maps of the galaxy .",
    "these dusty filaments may be similar to the dusty clouds we see , though it is unclear if their vertical extents are as great as the structures seen in our sample of galaxies .",
    "the draco cloud , an intermediate - velocity h@xmath12i  and molecular cloud of great interest since it absorbs background x - rays ( burrows & mendenhall 1991 ) , has recently been shown to lie at a height @xmath137 pc by gladders _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "this cloud may be similar in column density to the structures we discuss , but its mass and height above the plane are significantly less than the structures we identify .",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) report on h@xmath12i  observations of a galactic supershell in the inner galaxy ( the `` scutum supershell '' ) .",
    "this structure stretches to heights @xmath138 pc from the midplane and contains some @xmath139 m@xmath9 , with an estimated potential energy of @xmath140 ergs .",
    "furthermore , a high-@xmath3  cloud ( @xmath141 pc ) containing @xmath142 m@xmath9  of material seems to be associated with this structure .",
    "the h@xmath12i  column density of this high-@xmath3  cloud is of order @xmath143 @xmath16 , and its diameter is @xmath144 pc .",
    "a structure such as the scutum supershell , or perhaps the high-@xmath3  cloud associated with it , would be visible in our galaxies , provided there was little stellar light along the line of sight arising in front it . another possible galactic analog may be the low - latitude intermediate velocity arch ( lliv arch ; kuntz & danly 1996 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) have shown this structure to lie at a height @xmath145 kpc from the plane of our galaxy . with peak column densities of a few times @xmath146 @xmath16 , and a total mass @xmath147 m@xmath9  ( kuntz & danly 1996 ; wakker _",
    "et al._1996 ) , this feature might be detectable if placed in our target galaxies .",
    "given its relatively low column density ( and its unknown dust content ) it might only be detectable if it were in front of most of the starlight .",
    "one implication of the observed dust structures in many of our target galaxies is that dust opacity can not be neglected at heights @xmath148 kpc from the midplane . in paper  i  we estimated values of @xmath149 mag . for a sample of absorbing structures at heights @xmath150 kpc in ngc  891 .",
    "we have found similar values for absorbing structures in ngc  4013 ( e.g. , howk & savage 1999c ) .",
    "intercepting only one of these features along the line of sight provides an optical depth @xmath151 ( to light arising behind it ) in the visual wavebands .",
    "the complicated and widespread distribution of absorbing structures in many of these galaxies suggests that an observer may expect to intercept more than one of these features along sightlines having heights up to @xmath125 kpc , and perhaps further .",
    "the true form of the @xmath3-distribution of dust opacity in edge - on galaxies may be poorly constrained by many of the current fits to the vertical light distribution .",
    "the presence of a dusty thick disk of material with relatively large scale height ( e.g. , @xmath152 kpc ) can create problems for fits to the one- or two - dimensional light profiles of spiral galaxies .",
    "the opacity distribution caused by thin+thick disk distributions of dust can be relatively well - fit by a single component dust model ( k. wood , private communication ) , but the resulting scale height estimate of the opacity is larger ( smaller ) than that of the true thin ( thick ) disk opacity .",
    "thus previous estimates for the dust scale heights in galaxies that show evidence for significant high - z opacity may need to be questioned .",
    "if the gas - to - dust ratio in these dust structures is similar to that found in the galactic disk , the opacity to x - ray emission could also be quite large .",
    "for example the optical depths at 0.25 , 0.5 and 1.0 kev associated with neutral disk material having @xmath153 in our galaxy are @xmath154 , respectively ( b. benjamin , private communication ) .",
    "however , the distribution of opacity along a given sightline through a dusty thick disk of material is likely quite patchy , making the transfer of radiation more difficult to account for when attempting a correction for absorption .",
    "studies of the distribution of material traced by x - ray , ultraviolet , or optical light should take care to examine how the presence of dust having optical depth unity at visual wavelengths to heights @xmath117 kpc affect their results .",
    "we present the results of a high resolution ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) imaging survey , using the wiyn 3.5-m telescope , of nearby edge - on galaxies , the purpose of which is to search for high-@xmath3  dust in absorption against the background stellar light of our target galaxies .",
    "this work follows from the identification of hundreds of high-@xmath3  absorbing structures seen in the galaxy ngc  891 by howk & savage ( 1997 ) .",
    "a summary of our major results is as follows .    1 .",
    "inhomogeneously distributed ( clumped ) high-@xmath3  dust is a common property of @xmath4 spiral galaxies ; five of seven such galaxies in our final sample exhibit high-@xmath3  ( @xmath31 pc ) dust structures .",
    "2 .   there is a close correlation between the presence of high-@xmath3dig and dust in our sample . of those galaxies that have been searched for high-@xmath3  h@xmath11  emission ( nine total , seven from our final sample ) ,",
    "all that show such emission also show observable dust structures at high-@xmath3  ( seven of nine , or five of seven drawn from our final sample ) , none of those galaxies lacking h@xmath11  emission at high-@xmath3  show evidence for dusty material far above the disk ( two of nine , or two of seven from our final sample )",
    ". this correlation may be due to a common driver of high-@xmath3  material and is probably associated with vigorous star formation in the underlying disk .",
    "we derive the properties of several individual dust structures , which show sizes of order @xmath155 pc . in general",
    "we find apparent extinctions @xmath156 , though the true v - band extinction may be significantly greater than these values .",
    "assuming galactic gas to dust ratios are appropriate , the masses of these structures exceed @xmath139 m@xmath9 .",
    "the potential energies of these structures are likely quite large , of order @xmath97 ergs relative to @xmath157 .",
    "the dust features exhibit a wide range of morphologies .",
    "one of the more impressive examples is seen above the bulge of ngc  4217 ( ngc 4217:d @xmath67 ) ; this structure appears as a loop of diameter @xmath158 kpc , maximum height @xmath159 kpc , and total mass @xmath160 m@xmath9 .",
    "we comment on the possible mechanisms responsible for creating and shaping the observed dust structures .",
    "possible mechanisms include hydrodynamical flows ( e.g. , galactic fountains or bores and chimney models ) , flows assisted or driven by magnetic fields or radiation pressure , and _ in situ _ formation of high-@xmath3  clouds from cooling high-@xmath3  gas .",
    "three of our galaxies have close companions ; in these cases the high-@xmath3  gas and dust may be caused by galaxy interactions , either through triggered star formation or tidal stripping .",
    "we discuss in detail the possibility that the dusty clouds we observe represent a dense phase of the high-@xmath3  ism in pressure equilibrium with the extraplanar warm ionized or hot medium .",
    "rough calculations for the best - studied galaxy ngc  891 suggest that the high-@xmath3  ism in this galaxy satisfies the requisite conditions for support of a dense phase ( e.g. , wolfire _",
    "et al . _  1995a ,",
    "our rough estimates for the density of the observed structures are compatable with the wolfire _",
    "_  results for high column density clouds .",
    "we discuss the possibility that star formation may be occuring in these dense high-@xmath3  clouds .",
