    "understanding the string - black hole transition is an important problem in string theory .",
    "the radius of a schwarzschild blackhole becomes smaller with rising temperature and at a certain temperature the blackhole transits to a gas of strings @xcite .",
    "this is a difficult problem to address as it needs a proper understanding of non - perturbative effects in string theory .",
    "the finite temperature of a schwarzschild blackhole breaks supersymmetry and string loop corrections are uncontrolled . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the problem of the string - blackhole transition can be formulated in a space - time with @xmath7 boundary conditions .",
    "this enabled one to use the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to map the string - blackhole transition phenomenon to a gross - witten - wadia ( gww ) type phase transition @xcite in the boundary gauge theory defined on @xmath8 .",
    "the compactness and positive curvature of the space @xmath2 permits one to integrate out all other modes to get an effective multi - trace unitary matrix model for the zero mode of the polyakov line . based on the works @xcite ,",
    "this type of effective unitary matrix model was analyzed in @xcite to show the existence of the gww type transition .",
    "the @xmath9 part of the gauge theory effective action was also calculated in a double scaled region near the transition temperature .",
    "the @xmath9 part is universally given in terms of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 satisfies the following differential equation @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the painleve ii function , and @xmath14 is a scaled variable proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the derivation of the effective unitary matrix model from the gauge theory is a subtle one . in a weakly coupled gauge theory",
    "one may demonstrate this explicitly in perturbation theory at large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however the situation is less clear in the strong coupling regime .",
    "one difficulty comes from the gregory - laflamme transition for a small @xmath7 blackhole .",
    "this transition breaks the @xmath4 symmetry of @xmath16 and the question arises whether there is a new zero mode associated with this transition , and whether the unitary matrix model is a good description after this transition . in @xcite it has been shown , using a supergravity analysis within the ads / cft correspondence , that even at strong coupling , the unitary matrix model serves as an effective description .",
    "given the physical relevance of the gww transition , it is important to see if this phenomenon occurs when one is not dealing with the dynamics ( however complicated ) of a single unitary matrix or the quantum mechanics of a single unitary matrix .",
    "it is not at all obvious that this large-@xmath0 transition occurs in more complicated models of non - commuting matrices and gauge theories . in the past",
    "this question has been explored by douglas and kazakov@xcite in their study of two - dimensional yang - mills theory on @xmath17 .",
    "however this problem too , gets recast into a problem of a single unitary matrix because the partition function turns out to be the heat kernel on the unitary group . in order to answer these questions",
    ", there seems to be no analytic tools as is usually the case with complicated dynamical problems .",
    "hence we use numerical monte carlo methods to explore and exhibit the large-@xmath0 gww transition and also study the question of r - symmetry breaking at large @xmath0 . since the full @xmath1 sym theory on @xmath8 is too difficult , in the first run we study the gauge theory restricted to the zero modes of the bosonic sector .",
    "it is likely that this reduction captures the essential features of the dynamics .",
    "it is motivated by the fact that the metric of the small schwarzschild black hole is uniform on @xmath2 .",
    "regarding fluctuations in the bulk , the zero mode gauge theory has correspondence with fluctuations in the bulk which are independent of @xmath2 and only depend on the radial @xmath18 coordinate and time .",
    "the importance of exhibiting this transition lies in the fact that in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath3 , the system goes critical and the fluctuations give rise to universal formulas ( [ painleve ] ) which solely depend on the multi - critical point which is characterized by the exponent @xmath19 in the scaling law @xmath20 .",
    "hence the formulas for the black hole cross over which were derived using the effective unitary matrix model in @xcite are also valid while working directly with the zero mode sector of the gauge theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the zero mode action of the bosonic part of the @xmath1 sym theory on @xmath8 . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the numerical studies of the gww - type phase transition . in section 4 , we study the @xmath4 r - symmetry using monte carlo simulation .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions and future outlook .",
    "we study the @xmath1 sym theory , when all the bosonic fields are restricted to their zero modes on @xmath2 .",

    "this model has a @xmath30 gauge symmetry @xmath31 the euclidean time @xmath14 in the action ( [ action ] ) has a finite extent @xmath32 , which is the inverse temperature @xmath33 .",
    "both the gauge and the scalar fields obey the periodic boundary conditions @xmath34 while this model has three parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , these are not independent of each other , as @xmath36 can always be set to unity by the following redefinitions @xmath37 and rescaling of the fields @xmath38 the periodic boundary condition ( [ periodic_bc ] ) prevents us from fixing the @xmath39 gauge .",
    "however we can fix a gauge where the gauge field is static and diagonal : @xmath40 where @xmath41 $ ] . the indices @xmath42 run over @xmath43 .",
    "this gives rise to the fadeev - popov term @xmath44 whose derivation is given in full detail in @xcite . in the following , we study the action @xmath45 we study the model ( [ action_gf ] ) numerically by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the details of the algorithm are given in @xcite .",
    "we simulate the model with the time direction discretized .",
    "we apply the heat bath algorithm to the scalar fields and metropolis algorithm to the gauge field , respectively .",
    "it turns out that taking 10 lattice points of the time direction is enough and that increasing the lattice points further does not affect the result .",
    "in this section , we study the gww type phase transition of the simplest unitary matrix model , for which an analytical solution is available @xcite .",
    "this model is useful to test the accuracy of the numerical method .",
    "we start with the numerical simulation of the unitary matrix model consisting only of @xmath47 without adjoint scalar fields , where @xmath48 @xmath49 denotes the path - ordered product .",
    "we consider the partition function @xmath50 and define @xmath51 for an integer @xmath52 . in the static and diagonal gauge ( [ gauge_fixing ] ) ,",
    "@xmath53 these are the moments of the density of eigenvalues : @xmath54 .",
    "the first two moments are given by @xmath55    the third - order transition at the point @xmath56 is the gww transition .",
    "this is a transition between the gapped and ungapped phases of the eigenvalue distribution of the unitary matrix model . for a generic unitary matrix model , all @xmath57 s show a similar non - analytical behavior like @xmath58 , because near the gap opening point , the relevant operator is given by a linear combination of @xmath57@xcite .",
    "we first verify this result numerically using monte carlo simulation . to this end , we take static and diagonal gauge ( [ gauge_fixing ] ) and add the fadeev - popov term ( [ fp_ghost ] ) .",
    "namely , we apply the metropolis algorithm to the action @xmath59 we plot the vev s @xmath60 against @xmath61 in figure [ gw-0502227 ] for @xmath62 , and find that they actually agree with the result ( [ tru_analytic ] ) .",
    "we next study the saddle point of the gauge field by adding the chemical potential @xmath63 to the action ( [ action_gf ] ) .",
    "namely , we study the matrix model @xmath64 where the terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined in ( [ action ] ) and ( [ fp_ghost ] ) , respectively , and @xmath67 is the polyakov line defined in @xmath68 .",
    "we first study the @xmath69 case , in which the numerical simulation of large @xmath0 is reachable at a reasonable cpu time .",
    "the phase transition of the one - dimensional matrix quantum mechanics with respect to the temperature has been studied in @xcite in the absence of the chemical potential .",
    "the polyakov line @xmath70 is small in the low - temperature region , while it is large in the high - temperature region .",
    "we focus on the low - temperature region @xmath71 , in which the polyakov line @xmath70 is small for @xmath72 .",
    "we plot the result of the @xmath69 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 case in figure [ d2-case ] .",
    "the graph above indicates a signature of the phase transition ( possibly third or higher order ) near the critical point @xmath75 at which the polyakov line is @xmath76 .",
    "this is expected from the fact that @xmath77 near the transition point . to understand the nature of the transition we first numerically plot the derivative @xmath78 in figure [ d2-case ] ( left ) .",
    "the derivative seems to be continuous , and hence the possible transition should at least be of third order .",
    "numerical errors prevent us from going further and calculating the higher derivatives directly from our data .",
    "instead , in figure [ d2-case ] ( right ) we try to fit our data with analytic functions in the regime @xmath79 and @xmath80 and extrapolate the information about derivatives from the fitted functions .",
    "it should be noted that the fitted functions do not necessarily represent the correct analytic form of the exact answer , but they can be viewed as a close approximation .",
    "we fit the vev @xmath70 with the function @xmath81 we exploit the fact that in the large-@xmath0 limit , @xmath82 is 0 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 as @xmath85 . and",
    "from the fact that @xmath86 and its first derivative @xmath87 are continuous at the critical point @xmath88 , we obtain the condition for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 the parameters @xmath92 are fitted as @xmath93 in this case , the coefficients @xmath94 are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "we find that the contribution of the terms @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath80 is small compared to the rest of the terms in ( [ u1_fit ] ) .",
    "since its second derivative @xmath100 is discontinuous at the critical point @xmath101 , this system undergoes the gww type third - order phase transition .",
    "the vev @xmath102 is small when @xmath98 , and in this region @xmath102 is closer to zero at larger @xmath0 . when @xmath80 , it is fitted with the following function similarly to the unitary matrix model .",
    "@xmath103    next , we turn our attention to the high - temperature case @xmath104 , in which the vev s of the polyakov line @xmath105 are large even in the absence of the chemical potential .",
    "we plot @xmath106 against @xmath107 for @xmath69 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 case for @xmath74 in figure [ d2-high ] .",
    "in contrast to the low - temperature case , we find that there is no gww type third - order phase transition in this case and that the vev s of the polyakov line increase monotonically .",
    "we next study a different dimensionality , @xmath110 .",
    "similarly , we plot the vev s @xmath60 against @xmath107 in the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath73 case for @xmath112 in figure [ d6-case ] .",
    "we read off the critical point as @xmath113 then , we fit them with the functions ( [ u1_fit ] ) and ( [ u2_fit ] ) . in this case , the parameters are @xmath114 the coefficients @xmath94 are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which suggests that the contribution of the @xmath94 terms is smaller than that of the rest of the terms in ( [ u1_fit ] ) .",
    "we find that the result is similar to the @xmath69 case .",
    "in this section , we study the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath4 r - symmetry of the model ( [ action_gf ] ) by monte carlo simulation . throughout this section ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath110 dimensional case . in analogy with the ikkt - type matrix model @xcite",

    "the above scenario implies that the dominant contribution of the path integral comes from the configurations for which the eigenvalues of @xmath131 are not equal and consequently the @xmath4 symmetry is broken .",
    "hence by plotting the vev s of the eigenvalues of @xmath131 and measuring the width of the distribution , we can figure out the possibility of @xmath4 symmetry breaking at large @xmath0 .",
    "this leads us to evaluate the vev s of these eigenvalues @xmath132 in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "after diagonalization , the residual @xmath4 transformations permute the eigenvalues @xmath122 . hence an unbroken @xmath4 symmetry implies , @xmath133 whereas a broken @xmath4 symmetry implies that for some @xmath134 . to this end , we extrapolate the large-@xmath0 limit from the simulation of finite @xmath0 .",
