    "the natural model containing two higgs doublets is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the higgs potential of the mssm could break @xmath0 symmetry explicitly or spontaneously taking account of radiative corrections .",
    "however the radiative violation leads to the fact that explicit @xmath0 violation through the higgs sector in the mssm is too small to have any significant phenomenological implications and spontaneous @xmath0 violation in the mssm also requires the existence of a light higgs `` pseudoscalar '' which is inconsistent with experiments@xcite .",
    "so we should extend the model in order to have significant @xmath0 violation effects in the higgs sector in susy models .",
    "the minimal extension is adding the gauge singlet field @xmath1 to the mssm , which is so - called next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite .",

    "as shown later , scalars and a pseudoscalar of two higgs doublets do not mix and scalar - pseudoscalar mixings only exist among higgs doublets and the singlet and among the singlet itself at the tree level . these results can be derived by using the stationary conditions of phases and are completely different from the results obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "these mixings vanish in the limits of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath4 , where @xmath11 is the electroweak scale and @xmath12 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the singlet field @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath6 , large mixings among scalars and pseudoscalars",
