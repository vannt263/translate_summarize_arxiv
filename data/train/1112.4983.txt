    "astrophysical signals typically are superposition of various subsignals , regular and random , by features comparable to each other and of weaker ones , i.e. perturbations or the noise .",

    "the technique of the degree of randomness has been applied to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature sky maps and to the x - ray flux data of the clusters of galaxies .",
    "the former data were those obtained by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) during 7-year observations @xcite , while the x - ray data were obtained by xmm - newton satellite providing a particularly accurate and complete sky survey ( see @xcite ) . in the case of cmb ,",

    "this technique resembles the methods of the dynamical systems applied to nonlinear problems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a crucial step in these studies is the modeling and analysis of generated systems , which enables to reveal the behavior of the stochasticity parameter in the case of a given signal and then to consider the application of this technique for real signals @xcite .",

    "we consider a broad class of sequences , i.e. those composed of random @xmath11 and regular @xmath12 ( @xmath13 are prime numbers ) sub - sequences within @xmath14 @xmath15    the parameter @xmath16 varies within [ 0,1 ] defining random sequences at @xmath17 and regular ones at @xmath18 , so that by mutually fixing the pair @xmath13 we get new regular sequences .",

    "at certain values of the parameter @xmath29 for different values of @xmath30 the dependences in fig.2 are monotonic , while for others they do have maxima . to study this effect",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath31 which is the difference of two values in those plots : maximal value of @xmath25 and minimal value in the range @xmath32 , if @xmath33 is the position of the maximal value .",
    "obviously , @xmath31 is zero when the dependence is monotonic and no extrema do exist .",
    "then we calculate @xmath31 for fixed @xmath30 and for each value of primary @xmath34 .    the dependence of @xmath31 vs the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "]    the remarkable feature of the results is the strict mirror symmetry in fig.[fig : deltas ] in the dependence of @xmath31 vs @xmath29 , although no periodicity is found by fourier analysis .",
    "the mirror symmetric plots can be hence subjects of particular study , e.g. in two versions : first , of the distribution of @xmath31 and , second , the spacing between non - zero @xmath31 and their distribution .",
    "the null values of @xmath31 are skipped and also - since due to the mirror symmetry each @xmath31 has its pair - only one of each pair is taken into account .",

    "kolmogorov s function therefore enables to distinguish the superposition of random and regular sequences , even though both are tending to gaussians .",
    "finally , we have probed the dependence of the results on the length of the sequences : the dependence on the number of the fluctuations within @xmath54 is rather weak , @xmath25 varying around @xmath55 .",
    "this confirms the universality of the obtained behavior of @xmath10 for both random and regular fluctuations .",

    "\\c ) the behavior of the randomness of a signal composed of @xmath48 subsignals at large @xmath48 limit has been studied , where the kolmogorov function acts as an informative descriptor .",
    "particularly , the descriptor at large @xmath48 enables to distinguish the initial set of the fluctuations , even when the superposition both of random and regular subsignals is not informative since tends to a gaussian in accordance to the central limit theorem .",
    "the studied properties are typical , for example , for astrophysical datasets , when the sought signals are superposed with regular and random fluctuations of various origin , and hence the behaviors revealed at the numerical experiments due to the universality of the technique will enable its informative application to real data ."
