    "in the last few decades , we have seen many instances where quantum information processing is more advantageous than its classical counterpart .",
    "the things that cross our mind when we talk about advantage are the additional tasks which can be achieved using quantum resources .",
    "we have seen that this list is not small .",
    "information processing tasks like teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , secret sharing @xcite do not have any classical analogue and are also very different from the counterparts .",
    "interestingly , these advantages not only come from the things we can accomplish but also from restrictions that nature itself imposes on us . in quantum mechanics , it is well known that it is impossible to clone an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "this leads to the famous no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "more precisely , there exists no quantum mechanical operation which can generate a perfect clone of two non - orthogonal states i.e. transform @xmath0 and @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "but no - cloning is not the only important impossible operation .",
    "there are several other impossible operations which are popularly known as no - go theorems @xcite",
    ".    there have been multiple attempts in performing cloning approximately and under different settings .",
    "one of the earliest attempts was made by buzek et al @xcite in the year 1996 when they designed a universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) which copied states with fidelity @xmath4 which was later proved to be optimal @xcite .",
    "the machine introduced was input state independent and universal .",
    "however , in addition to this , there were other state dependent machines @xcite .",
    "another setting in which it has been explored is probabilistic cloning where the cloner can perfectly clone a secretly chosen state from a pool of linearly independent states with a non - zero probability @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "all these cloning machines are symmetric in the sense that they take as input a @xmath6 and transform it to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a blank state .",
    "there exists another set of cloners known as asymmetric cloners .",
    "these cloning machines are involved in producing two different copies of @xmath9 with different fidelities . in particular , they transform @xmath6 into @xmath10 .",
    "asymmetric quantum cloning in general is useful particularly when analyzing the security of some quantum key distribution protocols , because the optimal eavesdropping strategy , when it is known , often turns out to coincide with optimal asymmetric cloning @xcite but this is not always the case @xcite .",
    "other applications include telebroadcasting @xcite and asymmetric telecloning @xcite of states which is useful when information needs to be distributed among parties with varying trust .",
    "one of the many important features that makes quantum mechanics unique is entanglement . in other words , ` inseparability of quantum states ' in composite systems is not only a matter of deep interest from physics point of view , but also acts as a pivotal resource in the accomplishment of various information processing tasks as mentioned before @xcite .",
    "so , it is always crucial to have entanglement distributed across various nodes(parties ) in a network .",
    "it is interesting to see how we can distribute a given amount of entanglement between various pairs of nodes(parties ) in a network .",
    "there are many ways to achieve this task . in short ,",
    "this task is primarily known as 13broadcasting of entanglement13 @xcite .",
    "one of the various ways to achieve this is by cloning .",
    "cloning here can refer to both state - dependent and independent cloning as well as local and nonlocal cloning .",
    "recently it was shown that optimal broadcasting of correlations that go beyond entanglement is impossible @xcite . however ,",
    "if one relaxes the optimal criteria , broadcasting can be achieved .",
    "one can also use asymmetric cloners to achieve broadcasting of entanglement and this was considered by iulia ghiu @xcite where the task was carried out for a non - maximally entangled state using optimal local and nonlocal cloning machines . apart from correlations",
    ", there have been attempts to broadcast other important quantities such as quantum coherence @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we take the most general version of the cloning operation i.e. asymmetric cloning ( symmetric cloning is a special case of this ) and the most general two - qubit mixed state as a resource to broadcast entanglement and correlations beyond entanglement .",
    "we consider both optimal and non - optimal as well as local and nonlocal broadcasting .",
    "quite counter - intuitively we have both proofs and strong numerical evidence that non - optimal broadcasting of entanglement is no different from the optimal broadcasting , and optimal broadcasting of correlations is impossible",
    ". however , non - optimal broadcasting of correlations beyond entanglement is always possible .",
    "this brings out a unique and fundamental difference in these measures .",
    "moreover , with the decrease in the asymmetricity of the cloner , we show that the broadcasting range increases .",
    "this is not only true for the particular example of bell - diagonal state but also in general .",
    "we show numerically that there is increase in the number of states in the state space of the broadcasting zone with the increase in symmetricity of the cloner .",
    "in this section , we give a brief introduction to various concepts which will be useful and related to the main theme of the manuscript .",
    "we will try to present these related concepts in the form of definitions .      in this paper ,",
    "we have considered a general two qubit mixed state as a resource state which is represented in the canonical form as , @xmath11=\\{\\vec{x},\\:\\vec{y},\\ : t\\}\\:\\:\\ : \\mbox{(say ) , } \\label{eq : mix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] are local bloch vectors .",

    "the peres  horodecki ( * ph * ) @xcite criterion is used to test the separability of two quantum mechanical systems 1 and 2 , whose joint density matrix is given by @xmath21 .",
    "it is necessary and sufficient criterion for @xmath22 and @xmath23 dimensional bipartite systems .",
    "if at least one of the eigenvalues of a partially transposed density operator for a bipartite state @xmath21 defined as @xmath24 turn out to be negative then we can say that the state @xmath25 is entangled .",
    "equivalently , this criterion can be translated to the condition that determinant of at least one of the two matrices @xmath26    is negative ; with determinant of @xmath27 being simultaneously non - negative .      in the last decade , researchers came up with measures to quantify the correlations in the quantum systems , that go beyond entanglement .",
    "there are several such measures . in this article",
    "we have chosen geometric discord to quantify the correlations beyond entanglement @xcite . geometric discord (",
    "* gd * ) is a distance based measure defined for any general two qubit state @xmath21 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the set of all classical states of the form @xmath30 . here ,",

    "a cloning machine is said to be asymmetric when it takes @xmath43 and a blank state as input , and transforms it into two different copies @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this paper , we use two kinds of optimal cloning machines . for broadcasting using local cloner",
    ", we use the optimal universal asymmetric pauli cloning machine @xcite , @xmath44 where p is the asymmetric parameter of the machine and @xmath45 the first two qubits represent the clones and the last one is the ancilla .    for nonlocal broadcasting , we use the nonlocal optimal universal asymmetric pauli cloning machine @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 modulo @xmath49 .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate the local and nonlocal broadcasting of entanglement and correlations in more general sense for the general two - qubit mixed state using asymmetric pauli cloners . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we claim that non - optimal broadcasting of entanglement is not different from optimal broadcasting using asymmetric cloners . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this is exactly opposite to the behaviour for geometric discord , a measure of correlation beyond entanglement . here , we have no broadcasting for the optimal situation whereas we can broadcast correlations in the non - optimal scenario . </S>",
    "<S> this mutual exclusivity once again brings out the fact that these measures are fundamentally different . </S>",
    "<S> further , we notice that in general and also in particular example of bell - diagonal states , with the increase of symmetricity of the cloner , the broadcasting range increases . </S>"
