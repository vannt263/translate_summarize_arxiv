    "the problem of collapse in hydrodynamics , i.e. of a process of singularity formation in a finite time , is essential for understanding of the physical nature of developed turbulence . despite a progress in construction of statistical theory of kolmogorov spectra within both diagram and functional approaches ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , so far the question whether the kolmogorov spectrum is a solution to the statistical equations of hydrodynamics remains open .",
    "another important problem , as yet unsolved , is the one of intermittency . in statistical sense intermittency",
    "can be interpreted as a consequence of a strongly non - gaussian distribution of turbulent velocity , resulting in deviation of exponents for higher correlation functions from their kolmogorov values ( @xcite ) .",
    "non - gaussian behavior implies that odd correlation functions do not vanish ; this indicates the presence of strong correlations between velocity fluctuations , suggesting existence of coherent structures in turbulence .",
    "analysis of both numerical and experimental data reveals ( see @xcite and references therein ) that in the regime of fully developed turbulence distribution of vorticity is strongly inhomogeneous in space  it is concentrated in relatively small regions .",
    "what is the reason of this ?",
    "can such a high concentration be explained by formation of singularity of vorticity in a finite time ?",
    "how can one derive from this hypothesis the kolmogorov spectrum ?",
    "this question is not rhetoric : it is well known that any singularity results in a power - law kind of spectrum in the short - scale region .",
    "thus , the problem of collapse is of ultimate importance in hydrodynamics .",
    "the most popular object in the studies of collapse in hydrodynamics is a system of two anti - parallel vortex tubes , inside which vorticity is continuously distributed ( @xcite ) , or in a more general setup",
    " flows with a higher spatial symmetry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known , that two anti - parallel vortex filaments undergo the so - called crow instability ( @xcite ) leading to stretching of vortex filaments in the direction normal to the plane of the initial distribution of vortices and to reduction of their mutual distance .",
    "it was demonstrated in numerical experiments ( @xcite ) that point singularities are formed in cores of each vortex tubes at the nonlinear stage of this instability , and @xmath2 near the point of collapse increases like @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the time of collapse ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present results of a numerical experiment , which can be interpreted as emergence of singularity of vorticity at a single point in a three - dimensional ideal hydrodynamic system , where initial data lacks any symmetry .",
    "the representation of the euler equation for vorticity @xmath3 in terms of vortex lines is employed , which was introduced in @xcite : @xmath4 here the mapping @xmath5 represents transition to a new curvilinear system of coordinates associated with vortex lines , so that @xmath6 is a tangent vector to a given vortex line , @xmath7 is the jacobian of the mapping ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "dynamics of the vector @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flow velocity at a point @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the transverse projection to the vortex line at this point : @xmath13 equations ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) are closed by the relation between vorticity and velocity : @xmath14 the system of equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) can be regarded as a result of partial integration of the euler equation @xmath15,\\quad\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf v}=0.\\ ] ] a vector field @xmath16 incorporated in ( [ 1 ] ) , @xmath17 , is the cauchy invariant , manifesting frozenness of vorticity into the fluid . if @xmath18 is the initial distribution of vorticity .",
    "the jacobian @xmath19 can take arbitrary values because the description under consideration is a mixed , lagrangian - eulerian one ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath19 can vanish at some point , which by virtue of ( [ 1 ] ) implies a singularity of vorticity .",
    "it was demonstrated by @xcite that collapses of this type are possible in the three - dimensional integrable hydrodynamics where in the euler equation ( [ 5 ] ) a modified relation between vorticity and velocity ( both generalized ) is assumed : @xmath20 emergence of singularity of vorticity at a point , where @xmath21 , means that a vortex line touches at this point another vortex line .",
    "this is the process of breaking of vortex lines .",
    "being analogous to breaking in a gas of dust particles ( dynamics of a gas with a zero pressure ) , this process is completely determined by the mapping ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "let us assume now that collapse in the euler hydrodynamics occurs due to breaking of vortex lines .",
    "denote by @xmath22 a solution to the equation @xmath23 , and let @xmath24 , where the minimum is achieved at @xmath25 .",
    "near the point of the minimum @xmath26 the jacobian can be expanded ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath27",
    "where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a positive definite matrix and @xmath30 .",
    "the taylor expansion ( [ 7 ] ) is obtained under the assumption that @xmath19 is smooth , which is conceivable up to the moment of singularity formation . at @xmath31",
    "the numerator in ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e.  the vector @xmath32 , does not vanish : the condition @xmath21 is satisfied when the three vectors @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) lie in a plane , but generically none of them equals zero ( that were a degeneracy ) so that near the point of singularity @xmath35 furthermore , @xmath21 implies that an eigenvalue of the jacoby matrix ( say , @xmath36 ) vanishes , and generically the other two eigenvalues ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are non - zero .",
    "therefore , there exist one  soft \" direction associated with @xmath36 , and two  hard \" directions associated with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 7 ] ) , that in the auxiliary @xmath39-space the self - similarity @xmath40 is uniform in all directions",
    ". however , in the physical space the scales are different .",
    "following @xcite , we show how an anisotropic self - similarity emerges in the flow .",
    "the analysis for the euler equation coincides with that for the integrable hydrodynamics ( [ int ] ) .",
    "decompose the jacoby matrix @xmath41 in the bases of eigenvectors of the direct ( @xmath42 ) and conjugate ( @xmath43 ) spectral problems : @xmath44 the two sets of eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal : @xmath45 in a vicinity of the point of collapse the eigenvectors can be regarded as approximately constant .",
    "decompose the vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 in ( [ exp ] ) in the respective bases , denoting their components by @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 the vector @xmath51 can be represented in terms of @xmath49 as follows : @xmath52 as a result , ( [ exp ] ) can be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is assumed to be small . consequently",
    ", size reduction along the directions @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the same as in the auxiliary @xmath39-space , i.e. , @xmath58 , but in the soft direction , @xmath59 , the spatial scale is @xmath60 .",
    "in terms of new self - similar variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , integration of the system yields for @xmath64 and @xmath65 a linear dependence on @xmath66 , and for @xmath67  a cubic one : @xmath68 together with ( [ ome ] ) , relations ( [ system1 ] ) and ( [ system2 ] ) implicitly define the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the presence of two different self - similarities shows , that the spatial vorticity distribution becomes strongly flattened in the first direction , and a pancake - like structure is formed for @xmath72 . due to ( [ 1 ] ) and the degeneracy of the mapping ( @xmath21 ) , vorticity @xmath69 lies in the plane of the pancake . near the singularity behavior of @xmath69",
    "is defined by the following self - similar asymptotics : @xmath73 in essence , in the above analysis one is concerned with the behavior of the mapping near a fold , and thus breaking of vortex lines can be naturally explained within the classical catastrophe theory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "according to the collapse classification of @xcite , breaking of vortex lines is not a weak collapse but a super - weak one , because already a contribution from the singularity to the enstrophy @xmath74 characterizing the energy dissipation rate due to viscosity is small , @xmath75 ; a contribution to the total energy is @xmath60 .",
    "however , the integral @xmath76 is divergent as @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the breaking solution @xmath77 can not be continued beyond @xmath31 in the sobolev space @xmath78 with the norm @xmath79 . according to the theorem proved by @xcite , this suffices for @xmath80 to hold .",
    "the condition ( [ cr ] ) is necessary and sufficient for collapse in the euler equation , and it is satisfied for ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "another restriction follows from the theorem by @xcite , stating that there is no collapse for any @xmath81 $ ] if @xmath82 where the supremum is over a region near the maximum of vorticity @xmath2 .",
    "occurrence of collapse implies divergence of the integral ( [ 9 ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , @xmath84 has to increase at least like @xmath85 .",
    "it is evident that , due to solenoidality of @xmath69 , either the derivative @xmath86 in the direction along the vector @xmath69 in the pancake - like region should have no a singularity at the scales of the order of @xmath58 or larger , or the singularity should be weaker than @xmath85 .",
    "however , this does not rule out large gradients of @xmath87 in a region separated in the soft direction from the pancake - like region , for instance , with the behavior with @xmath88 .",
    "this conjecture is plausible , since transition from the @xmath39-space to the physical one involves a significant contraction in the soft direction of the region near the point of breaking : a sphere of radius @xmath75 is mapped into the pancake - like region .",
    "thus , a sphere in the of radius @xmath75 containing the pancake includes a large preimage of the region outside the sphere in the @xmath39-space of radius @xmath75 ( the shape of the preimage is governed by higher order terms in the expansion ( [ 7 ] )  ) . hence in the process of breaking of vortex lines three scales can appear : @xmath89 , @xmath90 and an intermediate scale with ( the presence of which assures that there are no contradictions with the theorem of @xcite ) .",
    "to verify the hypothesis that formation of singularity in the solutions to the euler equation can be due to vortex line breaking , we performed a numerical experiment for the system of equations ( [ 1]-[4 ] ) .",
    "two features of this system are notable .",
    "first , in contrast with the original euler equation , possessing an infinite number of integrals of motion  the cauchy invariants ,  the system ( [ 1]-[4 ] ) is partially integrated and therefore contains the cauchy invariants explicitly . hence , while the invariants are guaranteed to be conserved when ( [ 1]-[4 ] ) is solved numerically , it is necessary to test to which extent they are conserved in the course of direct numerical integration of the euler equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "second , in the system ( [ 1]-[4 ] ) integration in time ( in ( [ 3 ] )  ) is separated from integration over space ( in ( [ 4 ] )  ) , i.e. from inversion of the operator curl .",
    "the system ( [ 1]-[4 ] ) is considered under the periodicity boundary conditions and inversion of the operator curl can be performed by the standard spectral techniques with the use of fast fourier transform .",
    "the main difficulty in numerical integration of the system stems from the necessity of transition ( both direct and inverse ) between the variables @xmath70 and @xmath39 at each time step .",
    "it was circumvented by the use of two independent grids in the @xmath70-space : a moving one ( the @xmath91-grid ) , the motion of whose points is governed by ( [ 3 ] ) , and a steady regular one ( the @xmath70-grid ) , which coincides with the @xmath39-grid .",
    "the numerical algorithm consists of the following steps :        ( @xmath94 ) by linear interpolation from the values of vorticity at nearby points of the @xmath91-grid , determine @xmath69 on the @xmath70-grid ( for that , for each point of the regular grid it is necessary to find a tetrahedron , containing the point , whose vertices are the nearest points of the @xmath91-grid ) ;                computations are performed with the resolution of @xmath105 grid points . in order to check numerical stability of the algorithm test runs are made for several initial conditions , which are abc flows .",
    "any abc flow is an eigenfunction of the curl and hence it is a steady solution to the force - free euler equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "they are found to remain steady in computations with the time step @xmath106 up to @xmath107 with the relative error of the solution being within the @xmath108 threshold , and the jacobian @xmath19 being reproduced with the @xmath109 accuracy .",
    "an initial vorticity which we consider is a solenoidal field comprised of random - amplitude fourier harmonics with an exponentially decaying spectrum ; the decay is by 6 orders of magnitude from the first to the last spherical shell in the fourier space , the cut - off being at wavenumber 8 .",
    "it satisfies @xmath110 everywhere in the box of periodicity ( this enables one to perform the projection ( [ pro ] ) ; it is checked that this condition is not violated at all times during the run ) .",
    "this field does not possess any symmetry .",
    "in the course of numerical integration we monitor energy conservation : kinetic energy of the flow remains constant with the accuracy better than 1% .",
    "for such an initial condition we observe formation of a peak of @xmath2 at a _ single _ point . at this point",
    "the jacobian @xmath19 and @xmath104 are minimal over space at all times close to the time of collapse , and the minimal values decrease in time to a high precision linearly ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "( in this run the time step is @xmath111 for @xmath112 , and @xmath113 afterwards . ) in this run the maximum of vorticity increased almost 20 times before integration was terminated .",
    "the final width of the peak of @xmath2 is 2 - 3 times the length of the interval of spatial discretization ( fig .",
    "2 shows a strong localization of @xmath2 at the end of the run ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates concentration of vorticity lines and formation of a fold near the point of singularity .",
    "formation of similar peaks of vorticity accompanied by a decrease of @xmath19 to zero is also observed in several runs for other initial conditions of vorticity in the same class .    at different times",
    "the global ( over space ) minima of @xmath19 and of @xmath104 are achieved at four different points .",
    "behavior of the jacobian in time at one of these points ( short - dashed line on fig .",
    "4 ) suggests that the second singularity can also be developing ; it is not traced down to the time of its collapse , because this is prevented by formation of the first singularity .",
    "the peak of vorticity turns out to be narrow from the moment of its birth . in order to verify that it is not spurious ( i.e. it emerges not due to a numerical instability of our algorithm ) we have reproduced its formation in computations by a modified algorithm , with different interpolation techniques employed for linear interpolation at step ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "these techniques introduce some smoothing intended to inhibit formation of a spurious singularity .",
    "however , in the new run all numerical data has been reproduced with the relative precision @xmath114 .    to check that the given process can be considered as breaking of vortex lines we compute time dependencies of the hessian of the jacobian @xmath115 at the point of the minimum of @xmath19 . at the final stage of the saturated asymptotic linear behavior of the minimum we did not find any essential temporal variation of its eigenvalues .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the expansion ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates final positions of vortex lines near the point of collapse .",
    "some anisotropy is observed in the spatial distribution of @xmath3 near the maximum of vorticity .",
    "however , due to an apparent lack of spatial resolution we can not claim that two _ essentially _ different scales emerge",
    ". the following questions also remain open : why is the time of occurrence of collapse small compared to the turnover time ?",
    "why is the peak of vorticity quite narrow basically from the very moment of its appearance ?",
    "the obtained results can be interpreted as the first evidence of the vortex line breaking ; the collapse , which is observed numerically , is not related to any symmetry of the initial vorticity distribution and in particular the collapse occurs at a single point .",
