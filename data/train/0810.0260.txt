    "there are numerous dedicated transit searches surveying the sky for extrasolar planets that periodically transit across the face of their host star . among the wide angle searches ,",
    "those presenting discoveries have been tres @xcite , xo @xcite , hatnet @xcite , and superwasp @xcite .",
    "the initial high hope of finding hundreds of such planets @xcite was followed by 5 years of poor harvest , and a steep learning curve for these , and many other projects .",
    "in retrospect we now understand that several important factors had initially been underestimated , such as the need for dedicated telescope time , optimal precision , stable instrumentation , low systematic noise , the number of false positives @xcite , optimal follow - up strategy , and access to high precision spectroscopic instruments .",
    "the last year showed an exponential rise in announcements , indicating that these dedicated efforts have started to bear fruit .",
    "in fact , they have reached a success rate such that the same object is occasionally independently found and announced by different groups ( wasp-11b : @xcite = hat - p-10b : @xcite ) . such scenarios are not necessarily duplication of effort .",
    "it is reassuring that completely independent discoveries , follow - up observations and analyses lead to similar parameters .",
    "they also provide an opportunity for joint analysis of all datasets . here",
    "we report on a similar case , the confirmation of the planetary nature of the transiting object xo-5b , announced by @xcite .",
    "the present paper provides not only strong new evidence supporting the planetary nature of the object , but also improved physical properties that aid in the comparison with theories of planet structure and formation . in   [ sec : det ] we describe the details of the photometric detection .",
    "the follow - up observations , including the discussion of the bisector span measurements are presented in ",
    "[ sec : fu ] .",
    "the subsequent steps of the analysis in order to characterize the star , orbit and the planet are discussed in   [ sec : anal ] .",
    "two telescopes of the hatnet project , namely , stationed at fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo , @xmath11w ) , and , located on the rooftop of the submillimeter array control building at mauna kea , hawaii ( @xmath12w ) , were used to observe hatnet field `` g176 '' ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) on a nightly basis between 2004 november 26 and 2005 may 9 .",
    "altogether we acquired with these telescopes 2640 and 4280 frames , respectively , with exposures of 5 minutes .",
    "a number of candidates have emerged from this field , and have been subjected to intense follow - up by larger instruments ( ) .",
    "one candidate has become the transiting planet we call hat - p-9b @xcite .",
    "another candidate internally labeled htr176 - 002 has received extensive follow - up over the past two years .",
    "however , the large scatter in the spectral line bisectors , and their tentative correlation with orbital phase discouraged us from early announcement , and motivated us to pursue it further . subsequently , htr176 - 002 was announced as xo-5b by the xo group in 2007 may ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b08 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we present here our results since they provide independent confirmation and also refine most of the parameters .    by chance , xo-5 happens to fall at the edge of field `` g176 '' which overlaps with field `` g177 '' ( @xmath15 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "this field has been observed by the hatnet telescope and by the what telescope at wise observatory , israel @xcite . using these telescopes we collected 5440 and 1930 frames , respectively .",
    "altogether we obtained @xmath16 frames with photometric information on xo-5  an unusually rich dataset compared to data available for a typical hatnet transit candidate .    the frames from field `` g176 '' were processed and analyzed as described e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the light curves from this field were corrected for trends using the method of external parameter decorrelation ( epd , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "the light curves were then searched for periodic box - like signals using the box least squares algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we detected a significant dip in the light curve of the @xmath17 magnitude star gsc  02959 - 00729 ( also known as 2mass  07465196 + 3905404 ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; j2000 ) , with a depth of @xmath20mmag . the period of the signal was @xmath21days , while the relative duration ( first to last contact ) of the transit events was @xmath22 , which is equivalent to a total duration of @xmath23  hours ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc]a ) .",
    "in order to exclude the possibility of a false planetary detection , due to the misinterpretation of a transit - like signal caused by another astrophysical scenario ( such as an f+m dwarf system ) , we observed the candidate htr176 - 002 with the cfa digital speedometer @xcite on the tillinghast reflector .",
    "we acquired four spectra between 2007 january and march , each with an individual precision of @xmath24 .",
    "the observations showed a mean radial velocity of @xmath25 with an rms of @xmath26 , therefore ruling out a low - mass stellar companion ( but not a triple system ) , which would cause significantly higher rv variations .",
    "the spectroscopy also yielded an estimate for the projected rotational velocity and surface gravity of the star .",
    "we obtained high resolution and high signal - to - noise spectra with the keck - i telescope and hires instrument @xcite .",
    "we acquired 17 exposures with the iodine cell , and an additional iodine - free `` template '' .",
    "the measurements were made between 2007 march 27 and 2008 may 17 .",
    "the purpose of these observations was threefold : i ) to obtain high precision radial velocity ( rv ) measurements , ii ) to characterize the stellar properties , and iii ) to check for spectral line bisector variations as an indication of blends .",
    "these steps are discussed in the following paragraphs .",
    "as regards measuring the rv variations , the superimposed dense forest of @xmath27 absorption lines enables us to obtain an accurate wavelength shift compared to the template observation @xcite .",
    "the final rv measurements and their errors are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "the folded data , with our best fit ( see ) superimposed , are plotted in fig .",

    "the stellar atmosphere parameters were determined using the iodine - free template spectrum .",
    "the spectral modeling was performed using the sme software @xcite , with wavelength ranges and atomic line data as described by @xcite .",

    "we obtained follow - up photometric observations on four nights using the keplercam ccd on the telescope through sloan @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands .",
    "the observations were performed on 2008 january 2 ( partial transit ) , january 19 ( full transit ) , february 9 ( partial ) and march 26 ( full ) , with the total number of object frames being 114 , 428 , 268 and 521 , respectively .",
    "the integration times used at these nights were 45 , 30 , 30 and 15 seconds , respectively while the readout and storage required an additional @xmath35 seconds per frame .",
    "the typical rms of the follow - up light curves was 2mmag at the above cadence .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the calibrated frames , using an aperture series that ensures optimal flux extraction .",
    "details on the astrometry , photometry , decorrelation for trends , etc .",

    "[ fig : lc ] , superimposed with the best - fit transit light curve model ( see ) .",
    "a stellar eclipsing binary that is unresolved from a bright source would manifest itself as a blended system with shallow photometric transits , and with rv variations that are of the same order of magnitude as one can expect from a planetary system ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we investigated whether such a blend is a feasible physical model for htr176 - 002 in two ways : by examining the spectral line bisectors , and with a detailed modeling of the light curve under various possible blend scenarios .    for a blended eclipsing binary , in addition to the decrease in the observed rv amplitude ,",
    "the spectral lines would be distorted , as quantified by the `` bisector spans '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the bisector span variations correlate with the orbital phase , or the magnitude of these variations is comparable with the rv amplitude , then the system is likely to be a false positive ( hierarchical triple or chance alignment with a background binary ) rather than a single star with a planetary companion . in order to rule this out we derived the bisector spans by cross - correlating the iodine - free ranges of the obtained spectra against a synthetic template spectrum .",
    "we found that the standard deviation of the bisector spans is approximately @xmath36 , which is comparable to the magnitude of the rv variation itself ( @xmath37@xmath38 ; see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the large bisector variations discouraged us from publication even after the first full transit follow - up light curve was obtained in january 2008 , and we continued acquiring high resolution spectroscopy to establish whether there is any significant correlation between the bisectors and the orbital phase ( or equivalently , with the actual rv values ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvbis ] we display our measurements of the bisector spans as the function of both the rv and the rv residuals from the best fit .",
    "there is no statistically significant correlation between the velocities and bisector variations , as would be expected for a blend .",
    "however , there is apparently a correlation between the rv _ residuals _ and the bisector spans .",
    "this could be due to activity on the star ( e.g. , spottedness ) , where the activity ( if periodic ) causes both rv and bisector variations , but in a way that is not commensurate with the orbital period of the companion .",
    "we exploit this correlation in the joint analysis of the rv and photometric data ( see   [ sec : anal ] ) where we show that the unbiased residual of the rv signal can be significantly decreased with the inclusion of an additional term proportional to the bisector spans .    in order to rule out or confirm the importance of the stellar activity",
    ", we computed the ca ii emission index @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the derived indices are also shown in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "we found that the mean value of @xmath39 is moderately low , and the correlations between the values of @xmath0 and the radial velocity data or rv fit residuals are negligible ( see also ) .",
    "as a further way of assessing the true nature of the candidate , we investigated possible blend configurations by performing light curve fits of our highest - quality follow - up photometry ( data in the sloan @xmath34  band ) following the procedures described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , we attempted to reproduce the observed photometric variations with a model based on the ebop binary - fitting program @xcite in which three stars contribute light , two of which form an eclipsing binary with the orbital period found for xo-5 .",
    "the light from the third star ( the candidate ) then dilutes the otherwise deep eclipses of the binary , reducing them to the level observed for htr176 - 002 ( @xmath401.2% depth ) .",
    "the properties of the main star were adopted from the results of our analysis below , and those of the binary components ( mass , size , brightness ) were constrained to satisfy representative model isochrones .",
    "we explored all possible combinations for the binary components , and determined the best fits to the light curve in a chi - square sense .    the case of a hierarchical triple ( all stars at the same distance ) yielded an excellent fit to the photometry",
    "( see top curve in figure  [ fig : blends ] ) , but implies an eclipsing binary with a primary that is half as bright as htr176 - 002 itself .",
    "this is clearly ruled out by our keck spectra and even our digital speedometer spectra , both of which would show obvious double lines .",
    "we then considered scenarios in which the eclipsing binary is in the background ( which would make it fainter ) , and is spatially unresolved . because the proper motion of the candidate is relatively small ( @xmath4030 mas  yr@xmath41 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the chance alignment would remain very close for decades , precluding the direct detection of the binary in archival photographic images such as those available from the digital sky survey .",
    "for convenience we parametrized how far behind the eclipsing binary is placed relative to the candidate in terms of the difference in distance modulus , @xmath42 , and we explored a wide range of values . as an example , we find that for @xmath43 ( binary about 1.7 kpc behind ) the best fit yields a relative brightness for the binary of only 5% , which is at or below our detection threshold of 510% from the keck spectra .",
    "however , the ingress and egress are clearly too long given the quality of our photometry ( figure  [ fig : blends ] , bottom curve ) .",
    "for a smaller separation of @xmath44 ( binary some 500 pc behind ) the fit is somewhat better , though still visibly in disagreement with the observations ( figure  [ fig : blends ] , middle ) , and the relative brightness increases to 20% , which we would have noticed .",
    "additional tests changing the inclination angle from the edge - on configurations considered above to lower angles did not alleviate the discrepancies .",
    "the above modeling rules out both a hierarchical triple and a background eclipsing binary as possible alternate explanations for the photometric signals we detect .",
    "this , combined with the lack of any clear correlation between the bisector spans and the radial velocities , constitutes compelling evidence of the planetary nature of htr176 - 002 = xo-5 , and convinces us that the scatter in the bisector spans described above is intrinsic to the star .",
    "in this section we describe briefly our analysis yielding the orbital , planetary and stellar parameters for the xo-5 system .      for the initial characterization of the spectroscopic orbit , we fitted a keplerian model to the keck rv data , allowing for eccentricity by including as adjustable parameters the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in addition to a velocity offset @xmath47 , the semi - amplitude @xmath48 and the epoch @xmath49 .",
    "the period @xmath50 was held fixed at the value found from the hatnet light curve analysis ( from bls , see above ) .",
    "we found that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are insignificant compared to their uncertainties ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , suggesting that the orbit is circular however , in the determination of the orbital and stellar parameters , we incorporated the uncertainties yielded by the @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbital elements .",
    "we proceeded next with a joint fit using all data sets , namely , the hatnet discovery light curve , the flwo 1.2 m follow - up light curves , and the keck radial velocities along with the initial estimates of the spectroscopic properties derived through the sme analysis . the follow - up light curves were modeled using the analytic formalism of @xcite , assuming quadratic limb darkening .",
    "the limb darkening coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 were taken from @xcite , interpolating to the values provided by the initial stellar atmospheric analysis .",
    "the adjusted parameters for the joint fit were @xmath59 , the time of first transit center in the hatnet campaign , @xmath60 , the time of the transit center at the last follow - up ( on 2008 march 26 ) , @xmath61 , the out - of - transit magnitude of the hatnet light curve in the @xmath62  band , the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity @xmath48 , the velocity offset @xmath47 , the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the fractional planetary radius @xmath63 , the square of the impact parameter @xmath64 , the quantity @xmath65  which is related to the duration of the transit as @xmath66 , and the out - of - transit magnitudes @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the four follow - up light curves .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion about the advantages of this set of parameters .",
    "the initial values were based on the bls analysis , and our initial characterization of the orbit . to obtain the best - fit values",
    ", we utilized the downhill simplex algorithm ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the uncertainties and the correlations were determined using the markov chain monte - carlo method @xcite which yields the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the adjusted values .",
    "as mentioned in , we found that there is a significant correlation between the rv residuals and the bisector spans .",
    "this suggests it might be possible to improve the rv fit by including an additional term to account for this correlation .",
    "we therefore expanded the model for the velocity variation to @xmath71 where @xmath72 represents the _ base _ function for the radial velocity variations and @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath73 , @xmath74 . ] and @xmath75 is the actual bisector span variation for the @xmath34-th measurement .",
    "we found that when omitting the last term the unbiased residual is @xmath76@xmath77 , whereas its inclusion leads to decreased residuals of @xmath78@xmath77 , nearly a factor of two better .",
    "we tested also whether the inclusion of a similar term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rvmodel ] ) proportional to the stellar activity index ( with a coefficient @xmath79 ) provides any further improvement in the fit , but found that it actually degrades the residuals slightly .",
    "the final orbital and planetary parameters ( and their uncertainties ) derived in this paper are based on the above discussed radial velocity model function decorrelated against the bisector variations .",

    "if it orbited a g2v dwarf ( @xmath275au ) , the measured mass and radius of xo-5b require a small core to be consistent with theory even if no internal heating is assumed . using the work of @xcite , xo-5b is consistent with a 300myr old planet with a 50@xmath276 core , a 1gyr old planet with a 25@xmath276 core , or a 4.5gyr planet with a core smaller than 10@xmath276 mass .",
