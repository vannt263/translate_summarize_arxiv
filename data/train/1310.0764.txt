    "<S> lp 876 - 10 is a nearby active m4 dwarf in aquarius at a distance of 7.6 pc . </S>",
    "<S> the star is a new addition to the 10-pc census , with a parallax measured via the research consortium on nearby stars ( recons ) astrometric survey on the small & moderate aperture research telescope system s ( smarts ) 0.9-m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the astrometry , radial velocity , and photometric data for lp 876 - 10 are consistent with the star being a third , bound , stellar component to the fomalhaut multiple system , despite the star lying nearly 6@xmath0 away from fomalhaut a in the sky . the 3d separation of lp 876 - 10 from fomalhaut is only 0.77@xmath10.01 pc , and 0.987@xmath10.006 pc from tw psa ( fomalhaut b ) , well within the estimated tidal radius of the fomalhaut system ( 1.9 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> lp 876 - 10 shares the motion of fomalhaut within @xmath21 km / s , and we estimate an interloper probability of @xmath210@xmath3 . neither our echelle spectroscopy nor astrometry are able to confirm the close companion to lp 876 - 10 reported in the washington double star catalog ( wsi 138 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the castor moving group to which the fomalhaut system purportedly belongs , is likely to be a dynamical stream , and hence membership to the group does not provide useful age constraints for group members . </S>",
    "<S> lp 876 - 10 ( fomalhaut c ) has now risen from obscurity to become a rare example of a field m dwarf with well - constrained age ( 440@xmath140 myr ) and metallicity . besides harboring a debris disk system and candidate planet </S>",
    "<S> , fomalhaut now has two of the widest known stellar companions . </S>"
