    "there has always been benefits in studying lower dimensional field theoretical spacetimes such as @xmath0dimensions in general relativity .",
    "this is believed to be the projection of higher dimensional cases to the more tractable situations that may inherit physics of the intricate higher dimensions .",
    "recent decades proved that the cases of lower dimensions are still far from being easily understandable and in fact entails its own characteristics .",
    "the absence of gravitational degree of freedom such as weyl tensor or pure gravitational waves necessitates endowment of physical sources to fill the blank and create its own curvatures . among these",
    "the most popular addition has been a negative cosmological constant which makes anti - de sitter spacetimes to the extent that it makes even black holes 1 .",
    "addition of electromagnetic @xcite and scalar fields @xcite also are potential candidates to be considered in the same context . beside minimally coupled massless scalar fields which has little significance to add , non - minimally self - coupled scalar fields has also been considered . in particular , the real , radial , self - interacting scalar field with a liouville potential among others seems promising @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of the source in such a study is that the radial pressure turns out to be the only non - zero ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) component of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite . in effect",
    ", such a radial pressure turns out to make a naked singularity but not a black hole .",
    "being motivated by the self - intracting scalar field in @xmath0dimensional gravity we attempt in this paper to do similar physics with a non - linear electromagnetic field which naturally adds its own non - linearity .",
    "our choice for the lagrangian in nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) is the square root of the maxwell invariant , i.e. ( @xmath5 ) , where as usual the field tensor is defined by @xmath6 this lagrangian belongs to the class of ned with @xmath7power law maxwell invariant @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "similar lagrangian in @xmath9dimensions with magnetic field source has been considered in @xcite and with electric field as well as electric and magnetic fields together in @xcite .",
    "a combination of linear maxwell with the square root term has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "such a lagrangian naturally breaks the scale invariance , i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12constant , even in @xmath9dimensions so that interesting results are expected to ensue .",
    "let us add that such a choice of ned has the feature that it does nt attain the familiar linear maxwell limit unless @xmath13 .",
    "one physical consequence beside others , of the square - root maxwell lagrangian is that it gives rise to confinement for geodesic particles . for a general discussion of confinement in general relativistic field theory the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "contrary to the previous considerations @xcite in this study our electric field is not radial , instead our field tensor is expressed in the form @xmath1 for @xmath2constant .",
    "this amounts to the choice for the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath14 where our spacetime coordinates are labelled as @xmath15 and the constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 satisfy @xmath18 the particular choice @xmath19 , @xmath20 leaves us with the vector potential @xmath21 which yields a uniform field in the angular direction .",
    "the only non vanishing energy momentum tensor component is @xmath22 which accounts for the radial pressure .",
    "our ansatz electromagnetic field in the circularly symmetric static metric gives a solution with zero cosmological constant that is identical with the spacetime obtained from an entirely different source , namely the self - intracting real scalar field @xcite .",
    "this is a conformally flat anti - de sitter solution in @xmath0dimensions without formation of a black hole .",
    "the uniform electric field self - interacting is strong enough to make a naked singularity at the circular center .",
    "another solution for a non - zero cosmological constant can be interpreted as a non - asymptotically flat wormhole solution . in analogy with the @xmath9dimensions",
    "@xcite we search for possible particle confinement in this @xmath0dimensional model with @xmath23 truly the geodesics for both neutral and charged particles are confined .    in this paper , in addition to provide a new solution in ned theory , we investigate the resulting spacetime structure for a specific value of @xmath24 which arises by imposing traceless condition on the maxwell s energy momentum , that is known to satisfy conformal invariance condition . in this particular case the character of the singularity is timelike . for specific values of the parameters , the timelike character of the naked singularity at @xmath25 is also encountered in @xcite , in which the radial electric field is assumed within the context of ned with a power parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this singularity is investigated within the framework of quantum mechanics in @xcite .",
    "therein timelike naked singularity is probed with quantum fields obeying the klein - gordon and dirac equations .",
    "we investigate the timelike naked singularity developed at @xmath27 for the new solution , which incorporates a power parameter @xmath28 from the quantum mechanical point of view .",
    "the main motivation to study the singularity is to clarify whether the uniform electric field in angular direction has an effect on the resolution of this singularity or not . in order to compare the present study with the results obtained in @xcite",
    ", the singularity will be probed with two different quantum waves having spin structures @xmath29 and @xmath30 , namely , the bosonic waves and fermionic waves respectively .",
    "the result of this investigation is that , with respect to the bosonic wave probe the singularity remains quantum singular , whereas with respect to the fermionic wave probe the singularity is shown to be healed",
    ".    organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "among the values which @xmath37 may take the most interesting one is @xmath62 in this specific case @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the only non - zero component of the energy momentum tensor .",

    "ii ) * @xmath79 in this case the solution is a black string for @xmath80 whose kretschmann scalar is given by @xmath81with the singularity at the origin which is also the horizon .",
    "however , for @xmath82 with negative cosmological constant the solution becomes a wormhole with the throat located at @xmath83 and @xmath84 in order to conceive the geometry of the wormhole in this case we introduce a new coordinate @xmath85 such that@xmath86where @xmath87it should be supplemented that the ranges of @xmath42 must satisfy @xmath88to cast our spacetime into the standard wormhole metric we express it as @xmath89here @xmath90 and @xmath91 are known as the redshift and shape functions , respectively .",

    "one of the important predictions of the einstein s theory of relativity is the formation of the spacetime singularities in which the evolution of timelike or null geodesics is not defined after a proper time .",
    "deterministic nature of general relativity requires that the spacetime singularities must be hidden by horizon(s ) , as conjectured by penrose s weak cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) . however , there are some cases that the spacetime singularity is not covered by horizon(s ) , and it is called naked singularity . hence , naked singularities violates the cch and their resolution becomes extremly important .",
    "the most powerful candidate theory in resolving the singularities is the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however , there is no consistent quantum theory of gravity yet .",
    "string theory @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite are the two study field along the resolution of singularities .",
    "another method that we shall employ in this paper is the criterion proposed by horowitz and marolf ( hm ) @xcite that incorporates `` self - adjointness '' of the spatial part of the wave operator . in this criterion , the classical notion of _ geodesics incompletness _ with respect to point - particle probe will be replaced by the notion of _ quantum singularity _ with respect to wave probes .",
    "this criterion can be applied only to static spacetimes having timelike singularities . to understand better ,",
