    "there is general consensus that acceleration of crs by supernova remnants ( snrs ) is the main contributor of galactic crs at energies below @xmath14 tev ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is also generally thought that all crs with energies up to at least the second knee in the cr spectrum at @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) , or even up to the ankle at @xmath16 , are produced in our galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "meanwhile , cr acceleration to energies significantly exceeding 0.1  pev with the conventional mechanism of nonrelativistic first - order shock acceleration by snrs from typical ( type ia and ii ) supernovae ( sne ) is problematic @xcite .",
    "the origin of the knee in the cr spectrum , in the form of a spectral - index break in the power - law all - particle spectrum by @xmath17 units at @xmath18 , accompanied with a change in the cr composition , seems to suggest a new contribution to crs in the galaxy at these energies .",
    "we have recently proposed a model @xcite that explains the entire cr spectrum from gev up to ultra - high energies ( uhe ) with a single population of sources , namely sne .",
    "it is important to realize that sne consist of various types , not only the thermonuclear type ia sne , but also the core - collapse type ii and ib / c sne .",
    "observations indicate that long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are formed by a subset of type ib / c sne that collapse to black holes .",
    "these black - hole formation events are observed as grbs if the earth happens to fall within the narrow opening angles of their relativistic beams ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "grbs have been proposed as effective accelerators of crs in the universe @xcite , and as probable sources of crs up to ultra - high energies in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "our model assumes that crs with energies below @xmath14 tev are produced in the conventional quasi - stationary scenario of continuous injection due to nonrelativistic shock acceleration by snrs formed in all types of sne , with subsequent modification of the source spectrum through energy - dependent propagation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the principal proposal of our model is that up to the second knee , high - energy cosmic rays ( hecrs ) at @xmath19pev are mostly due to a single ( or a few ) relatively recent galactic grb supernova event that occurred some @xmath20yrs ago at distances @xmath21 from us .",
    "uhecrs from extragalactic grbs dominate at @xmath22 .",
    "we note that a  single - source \" model has been proposed earlier by erlykin and wolfendale @xcite , who suggested that the knee could be due to a single  normal \" supernova event that occurred some @xmath23 ago within @xmath24 from us . despite the apparent similarity in the approach ,",
    "the differences between the grb and snr single - source models are substantial on both qualitative and quantitative levels .",
    "these include    1 .   the possibility to explain acceleration of particles up to ultra - high energies by the relativistic shocks formed by grb outflows , which is very problematic in the case of snrs formed in the collapse to neutron stars ; and 2",
    ".   the much larger total energy of hecrs injected , which permits the source to have occurred at larger ( @xmath25kpc ) distances and from a significantly older grb than for a single normal sn source .",
    "this makes it then easier to explain the likelihood of such an event , as well as the low degree of anisotropy observed in hecrs .",
    "our model provides a way to explain the origin and the sharpness of the knee at @xmath26 as the consequence of pitch - angle scattering of crs on the plasma waves injected in the interstellar medium ( ism ) through dissipation of bulk kinetic energy of snrs effectively on the pc - scale sedov length .",
    "furthermore , we also explain the origin of the second knee in the spectrum of hecrs at @xmath27 as an unexpected but reasonable consequence of diffusive propagation due to scattering with turbulence injected on a scale of @xmath8 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the thickness of the galactic disk , which therefore represents the maximum natural scale for effective injection of plasma turbulence in the galaxy .",
    "the transition from galactic to extragalactic crs occurs around and above the second knee .    in this paper",
    "we present in more general terms the basic ideas and results of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , with particular emphasis on the effects of propagation and the allowed parameter space of the model .",
    "unlike relativistic electrons , relativistic protons and nuclei that contribute the bulk of the measured cr energy density do not suffer significant radiative energy losses during their lifetime in the galaxy ( heavier nuclei such as fe can , however , experience substantial depletion through spallation ) .",
    "in particular , radiative synchrotron and compton energy losses , which steepen the source spectra of relativistic electrons , are entirely negligible for relativistic hadrons in the ism and galactic halo , even at ultra - high energies .",
    "this admits only one remaining possibility to explain how the spectrum of cosmic rays with power - law index @xmath28 is steepened from the @xmath29 ",
    "@xmath30 injection indices for cr source spectra predicted by first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "namely , one has to invoke spectral steepening due to _ energy - dependent _ diffusive propagation in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "spectral steepening is then possible , but only if the energy density of crs observed locally is higher than the energy density of crs from  outside \" the source injection region .",
    "the steep spectrum of the observed crs , in particular hecrs , implies that we are within a local  bubble \" of crs , where the cr density is significantly higher than the mean energy density throughout the universe . at energies",

    "for example , considering even only sne as sources of mhd turbulence , we note that the sizes of snr shells reach @xmath113 , such as in w44 or w50 .",
    "thus , although in figure 2a we have assumed that snrs inject mhd turbulence only at scales @xmath7 , in reality their kinetic energy is dissipated in the interstellar medium ( ism ) through much larger scales . similar wide range of spatial scales should be also expected from other potential sources of mhd turbulence , such as high velocity clouds or large scale bubbles blown by stellar winds and multiple sne in regions of active star formation .",

    "thus , both kolmogorov and kraichnan types of turbulence at scales @xmath129 are possible . in the latter case an additional small steepening of the single - source spectrum below the first knee due to the relative proximity of the low - energy exponential turnover ( see fig .",
    "1 ) can also be invoked . in any case , the sharpness of the spectral break at the knee directly reflects the sharpness of the spectral break in @xmath61 at @xmath130 .",

    "thus , we could also assume a distance to the source @xmath138 for the same total energy ( @xmath139ergs ) , while keeping the exponential turnover of the spectrum at low energies significantly below 1pev .",
    "because of the invariance of the local cr spectrum with respect to the product @xmath140 , we could equally assume that the diffusion coefficient was smaller by one order of magnitude ( with @xmath141 ) , but a grb age @xmath142 .",
    "the smaller diffusion coefficient is also preferable because in that case the diffusion timescale of @xmath143gev crs out of the galactic disc would be in better agreement with the generally accepted value @xmath144 for these energies .",

    "an interesting result here is that in the framework of this model , the ankle in the spectrum of crs observed at @xmath158 is formed in the process of cooling of uhe protons on cosmological timescales .    similar spectral behavior for the extragalactic cr component at @xmath159 as shown in fig .",
    "4b , where the ankle is explained as a consequence of photopair losses of uhecrs formed at high redshift , were also derived by berezinsky and collaborators ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these authors @xcite consider a model where uhecrs are accelerated by active galactic nuclei and assume cosmological evolution of the injection rate of uhecrs @xmath160 ( see fig .",

    "4b ) agrees with the hires data , but is in disagreement with the agasa results at @xmath162 .",
    "if auger observations show any significant excess over the exponential gzk cutoff at these energies , this would imply that there are other recent ( @xmath163 ) local source sources of extragalactic origin in our vicinity at @xmath164 that produce this flux .",
    "one possibility is that the excess would be due to cosmic ray ions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the framework of our model , such extragalactic sources",
    "could be connected with starburst galaxies in the local group , such as m82 and ngc 253 , both at distances @xmath165 .",
    "taking into account that the supernova rate in these galaxies is about 0.3  1 per year , and that the estimated grb rate in our galaxy is about ( 0.3  1)% of the supernova rate , the mean grb rate in the starburst galaxies is estimated as one per @xmath166  1000 yrs . if the total energy of crs accelerated by a typical grb is indeed about @xmath167 , as for our local galactic grb , the characteristic injection power of uhecrs from starburst galaxies averaged over the timescale of @xmath168yr can be @xmath169 . in fig .",

    "the fluxes are calculated in the framework of a diffusion propagation model from a single source , assuming a diffusion coefficient with @xmath171 normalized at @xmath172 .",
    "note that the larmor radius of a @xmath173 proton in the magnetic field @xmath174 would be about @xmath175 .",
    "this implies that the assumed diffusion coefficient would still be larger , by a factor of 3 , than for bohm diffusion .",
    "the assumption of a different propagation model ( or diffusion coefficient ) in the intergalactic space would change the fluxes shown in fig . 5 , and will require a separate study .",

    "because grbs are found in our galaxy , we expect that crs to the highest energy will also be accelerated by past grb sources in the vicinity of earth .",
    "the transition from the galactic to the extragalactic component occurs at the second knee and , as also suggested by berezinsky and collaborators @xcite , the ankle is a consequence of pair - production interactions ( similar conclusions have been reached in ref .",
