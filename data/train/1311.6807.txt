    "total solar irradiance ( tsi ) satellite measurements are fundamental to the investigation of solar physics and the climate change forcing of tsi variability .",
    "tsi observations follow the solar magnetic activity level @xcite and their variation therefore conforms to the @xmath25-year schwabe solar cycle .",
    "the average tsi on solar cycle time scales is sometimes referred to as the _ solar constant_. tsi records are characterized by complex variability from the quasi monthly differential solar rotation cycles to the sub - annual and annual time scales whose origins are still unknown .",
    "an important physical issue is whether the annual and sub - annual tsi variability is intrinsically chaotic and unpredictable or , alternatively , is made of a complex set of harmonics and may be predicted once a sufficient number of constituent harmonics are identified .",
    "the latter possibility implies solar activity forecasts and may benefit from harmonic constituent modeling , as have the predictions of ocean tidal levels on earth using a set of specific solar and lunar orbital harmonics @xcite .",
    "the harmonic constituent model hypothesis is important because it could provide an explanation of many solar magnetic and radiative phenomena that conventional solar physics can not .",
    "the conventional view of solar science is that solar magnetic and radiant variability is intrinsically chaotic , driven by internal solar dynamics alone and characterized by hydromagnetic solar dynamo models @xcite .",
    "these models can not predict solar activity and have not been able to explain its complex variability .",
    "a growing body of empirical evidence suggests that solar activity on monthly to millennial time scales may be modulated by gravitational and magnetic planetary harmonic forces ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",

    "for example , the 11-year solar cycle appears to be bounded by the jupiter - saturn spring tide oscillation period ( 9.93 year ) and the jupiter orbital tide oscillation period ( 11.86 year ) @xcite .",
    "the 11-year solar cycle is also in phase with major tidal resonances generated by venus - earth - jupiter system ( 11.07-year period ) and by mercury - venus system ( 11.08-year period ) @xcite .",
    "the multi - decadal , secular and millennial solar oscillations appear to be generated by beat interferences among the multiple cycles that comprise the 11-year solar cycles @xcite .",
    "a recent commentary in nature discusses the `` revival '' of the planetary hypothesis of solar variation @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the arguments of critics of this hypothesis ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have either not been supported by empirical evidence or have based their arguments on overly simplistic newtonian analytical physics ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",

    ".    in a previous publication @xcite analyzed the power spectra of tsi records since 1992 .",
    "these were compared with theoretical power spectra deduced from the planetary orbital effects such as the tidal potential on the sun , and the speed , jerk force and z - axis coordinate of the sun relative to the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "the authors found multiple evidences of spectral coherence on annual and sub - annual scales between tsi power spectra and theoretical planetary spectra .",
    "this suggests that tsi is modulated at specific frequencies by gravitational and/or electromagnetic forcings linked to the revolution of the planets around the sun .",
    "@xcite found a tsi signature of the 1.092-year earth - jupiter conjunction cycle .",
    "the tsi oscillation was found to be particularly evident during the maximum of solar cycle 23 ( 1998 - 2004 ) and in phase synchronization with the earth - jupiter conjunction cycle that predicts an enhanced effect when the earth crosses the sun - jupiter conjunction line .",
    "the cause was postulated to be a slightly brighter side of the sun facing jupiter because that side would be the focus of enhanced planetary - solar couplings , both gravitational and electromagnetic .",
    "these forces exerted by jupiter on the sun are the strongest of all the planets .",
    "when the earth crosses the sun - jupiter conjunction line it adds to jupiter s planetary - solar coupling effects and sensors on earth satellites should receive a stronger tsi signal .",
    "this planetary - solar coupling effect generate the ~1.092-year cycle in the tsi record .    the 1.092-year cycle signature detected by the satellite tsi observations",
    "is enhanced during solar activity maxima and attenuated during solar minima @xcite suggesting complex , non - linear responses of solar internal dynamics to planetary forcings .",
    "here we study the dynamical evolution of the harmonic characteristics of the tsi observations on annual and sub annual time scales .",
    "a multiscale dynamical spectral analysis technique is proposed and used to reveal non - stationary changes in dynamical patterns in a sequence .",
    "the technique is used to determine whether major background harmonics exist that correspond to basic planetary harmonics such as the spring , orbital and synodic periods among the planets .",
    "the daily average tsi measurements were collected during the last decade by three independent science teams : acrimsat / acrim3 @xcite , soho / virgo @xcite and sorce / tim @xcite .",
    "cross - comparison of the three independent tsi records reduces interpretation errors due to measurement uncertainties .",
    "dynamical patterns common to the three tsi records are sought to increase the certainty of their physical origins .",
    "acrim3 results have been adjusted using algorithm updates and corrections for scattering and diffraction found in recent testing at the lasp / trf tsi radiation facility ( trf ) of the laboratory for atmospherics and space physics ( lasp) @xcite .",
    "similar lasp / trf corrections were recently found for the virgo results and they are now reported on an updated scale @xcite .",
    "the updated acrim3 , virgo and tim results agree closely in scale and variability with an average value during the 2008 - 2009 solar activity minimum near @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the acrimsat / acrim3 , soho / virgo and sorce / tim tsi records since 2003 are shown in figure 1 . for comparison ,",
    "figure 1 also depicts the daily sunspot number record from the solar influences data analysis center ( sidc ) .",
    "note that figure 1 shows the most recent soho / virgo record available that does not yet include the lasp / trf scaling corrections .",
    "thus , it is more significant to compare the three tsi records as percentage variation about successive two year periods as depicted in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 2 uses a constant scale for each two - year period to demonstrate the progressive divergence of tim relative to acrim3 and virgo results .",
    "the three records are scaled during the initial common two - week period ( 2003.15 - 2003.19 ) .",
    "the close agreement of all three satellite experiments results in 2003 was followed by continuous divergence of tim results from those of acrim3 and virgo through 2013 when the difference reached ~ 200 ppm .",
    "the most likely cause of the divergence , based on previous satellite tsi observational experience , is in - flight sensor degradation calibration error .",
    "the close agreement of acrim3 and virgo results , which is more evident in figures 2 - 3 , indicates that ( 1 ) an over - correction of tim sensor degradation is the most likely explanation .",
    "however , the cause could also be ( 2 ) a combination of degradation uncertainty by all three or ( 3 ) may be within the uncertainty of the self - degradation calibration capabilities of these instruments .",
    "the long term traceability of tsi satellite results , achieved through in - flight self - calibration of degradation , is an important area of continuing research for the climate tsi database .",
    "figure 3 uses a variable scale on each two - year segment to provide maximum visibility of the tsi variations for each sensor .",
    "it can be clearly seen that acrim3 , virgo and tim detect nearly all the same variations .",
    "tim appears to see them with slightly lower amplitudes . during the quietest magnetic activity part of the solar minimum period ( 2008.72009.3 )",
    "there is a near absence of variations in the tim record while virgo sees some of the variability detected by acrim3 during this time but at lower amplitudes .",
    "lower sensitivities of virgo and tim sensors is likely responsible for these differences .",
    "power spectrum evaluations of the tsi records are shown as figures 4 , 5 and 6 . in the following two subsections",
    "we analyze the multi - montly scale ( 0.1 - 1.1 year ) and the solar differential rotation scale ( 22 - 40 days ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the maximum entropy method ( mem ) power spectrum evaluation @xcite of the acrim3 , virgo and tim tsi records during the ten - year period from 2003.15 to 2013.16 .",
    "the power spectra are plotted as a function of the period ( @xmath28 ) up to 1 year .",
    "the figure shows that the three records produce nearly all the same spectral peaks indicating that the observed variations in tsi are definitively solar in origin .",
    "the spectral amplitude of the peaks for acrim3 record is nearly always higher than that observed for virgo and tim , indicating a higher sensitivity of acrim3 instrumentation for tsi variability .",
    "this sensitivity difference is supported as well by the fact that the tim and virgo records present slightly smoothed and attenuated patterns relative to those of acrim3 .",
    "the major spectral peaks are highlighted in the figure , and occur at the following approximate periods : @xmath0 year , @xmath29 year , @xmath30 year , @xmath31 year , @xmath32 year , @xmath33 year and @xmath34 year ; more uncertain peaks occur at about @xmath7 year .",
    "the above periods are found among the major planetary harmonics related to the orbital , synodic and spring periods for the planets .",
    "tables 1 reports these periods with their uncertainty and range during 2003 - 2013 for the four major tidal - causing planets ( mercury , venus , earth and jupiter ) @xcite .",
    "table 2 shows other theoretically expected periods related to the other planets as well .",
    "the major orbital , synodic and spring periods listed in table 1 are indicated with colored arrows at the top of figure 4 : red indicates orbital periods , black indicates spring periods , blue indicates the synodic periods and gray indicates the harmonics of the orbital periods listed in table 1 .",
    "the additional planetary frequencies listed in table 2 likely have only minor tsi effects and are not explicitly called out in figure 4 ; we report these additional frequencies for completeness .",
    "although there is currently a deficit of specific physical mechanisms to explain planet - sun interactions , these minor frequencies may also be found in solar records .",
    "@xcite found similar frequencies using theoretical equations deduced from the ephemerides of the planets such as the tidal potential on the sun and the speed , jerk force and z - axis coordinate of the sun relative to the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "statistical tests based on montecarlo simulations using red - noise generators for tsi synthetic records established that the probability of randomly finding a dynamical sequence manifesting a spectral coherence with the ( orbital , spring and synodic ) planetary theoretical harmonics equal or larger than that found among the tsi satellite frequencies and the planetary harmonics is less than 0.05% @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the spectral peaks shown in figures 4 and the colored arrows indicating the major expected planetary frequency peaks shows a clear coherence among the tsi and the planetary harmonics on multiple scales , in particular for the periods from 0.1 year to 0.5 year and for the 0.8-year periodicity .",
    "the three planetary periods at about 0.55 year and between 0.6 year and 0.65 year do not appear equally evident in the tsi results .",
    "the periodogram is used ; [ b ] the maximum entropy method ( mem ) is used .",
    "the colored arrows at the top of the figure indicate the major theoretically expected planetary frequencies from mercury , venus , earth and jupiter , which are reported in table 1 .",
    "the red color indicates the orbital periods , the black color indicates the spring periods , the blue color indicates the synodic periods and the gray color indicates the harmonics of the orbital periods listed in table 1 .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as discussed in the introduction , the response of the sun to external planetary forcing may be non - linear with some frequencies enhanced by internal solar dynamics during specific periods ( e.g. solar maxima ) and attenuated during others ( e.g. solar minima ) .",
    "indeed , changing the analyzed period as done in figure 5 ( we used the data from 2003.15 to 2011 ) produces some differences relative to the results depicted in figure 4 .",
    "for example the amplitudes of the peaks are different although their frequency position is fairly unchanged .",
    "this demonstrates that non - linear mechanisms are regulating the phenomenon .",
    "section 4 addresses the non - linear dynamical evolution of the tsi patterns more systematically .",
    "figure 6 magnifies figure 4 between 22 and 40 days .",
    "this range corresponds to the differential solar rotation period band .",
    "figure 6 clearly shows a spectral peak at ~27.3 days ( 0.075 year ) @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the synodic period between the well - known carrington solar rotation ( ~25.38 days ) and the earth s orbital period ( ~365.25 days ) .",
    "the carrington period roughly corresponds to the solar rotation period at a latitude of @xmath35 from the sun s equatorial plane , which is the average latitude of sunspots and corresponding magnetic solar activity @xcite , as seen from the earth .",
    "figure 6 also reveals spectral peaks at @xmath9 days ( @xmath10 year ) , at @xmath13-@xmath14 days ( @xmath15-@xmath16 year ) and @xmath17-@xmath18 days ( @xmath19-@xmath20 year ) suggesting that the sidereal equatorial and polar solar rotation cycles would be also detected in tsi records .",
    "however , the presence of these cycles in the tsi records could imply that the solar orientation relative to space also modulates solar activity .",
    "a possible explanation of these spectral peaks could require a planetary influence on the sun .",
    "assuming that the jupiter s side of the sun is the focus of higher solar activity @xcite it is possible to interpret the @xmath9 days ( @xmath36 year ) cycle as the synodic period between jupiter s sidereal orbital period ( ~4332.6 days = ~11.862 years ) and the solar equatorial rotation period .",
    "the latter is estimated to be @xmath37 days ( @xmath38 year ) during the period analyzed here from 2003 to 2013 . using this estimate ,",
    "additional planetary synodic cycles with the solar rotation are calculated at : @xmath39 days ( @xmath40 year ) , the synodic solar equatorial rotation period relative to earth ; @xmath41 days ( @xmath42 year ) , the synodic solar equatorial rotation period relative to venus ; and @xmath43 days ( @xmath44 year ) , the synodic solar equatorial rotation period relative to mercury .",
    "see table 3 .",
    "the @xmath43-day mercury - sun synodic period fits the tsi spectral peak at @xmath13-@xmath14 days , a period that corresponds also to the high latitude solar differential rotation rate .",
    "however , the theoretical synodic spectral peaks at @xmath39 days and @xmath41 days do not appear in fig .",
    "5 . this would suggest that solar asymmetry causes a tsi enhancement as the sun s more sensitive region orientates only toward jupiter and mercury .     of the high - pass filtered acrimsat / acrim3 ( black ) , soho / virgo ( blue ) and sorce / tim ( red ) total solar irradiance records depicted in figure 6.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "mercury may have a strong effect because mercury is the closest planet to the sun .",
    "after jupiter , mercury induces on the sun the second largest tidal amplitude cycle related to a planetary orbit due to its large eccentricity ( @xmath45 ) and low inclination to sun s equator ( @xmath46 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 8) .",
    "moreover , the theoretical @xmath43 day mercury - sun synodic period is near a 2/5 resonance with mercury s orbital period ( @xmath47 days ) or @xmath48 days ( @xmath49 year ) .",
    "this close resonance may favor dynamical synchronization and amplification in solar dynamics and explain the wide , strong tsi spectral peak around @xmath13-@xmath14 days that appears bounded by mercury s two theoretical frequencies as figure 6 shows .",
    "thus empirical evidence suggests that the differential solar rotation may be synchronized to the synodic cycles between the solar equatorial rotation and the two theoretically most relevant tidal planets : jupiter and mercury .",
    "further investigation of the solar rotation period band requires a dedicated investigation that is left to another work .",
    "multi - scale dynamical spectral analysis diagrams for the three tsi records were constructed as follows .",
    "we consecutively calculated normalized power spectrum functions using mem , which produces sharp peaks and it is less affected by leakage artifacts .",
    "we processed the tsi records after high - pass filtering to eliminate time scale variations longer than 2 years .",
    "figure 7 depicts the fast fourier transform ( fft ) 2-year high - pass filtered components of the three tsi records .",
    "we analyzed consecutive 5-year moving centered windows of the data ( for example , the results centered in 2006 refer to the 5-year period from 2003.5 to 2008.5 ) .    figure 8 shows the 5-year moving standard deviation functions , @xmath50 , of the high - pass filtered tsi records that were used for local normalization of the mem functions . during the solar minimum @xmath50 is attenuated relative to the solar cycle 23 and 24 maxima in all three tsi records .",

    "the colored arrows at the left of the diagrams indicate the theoretically expected frequencies of the most significant planetary harmonics ( ph ) obtained from mercury , venus , earth and jupiter , which are reported in table 1 .",

    "figure 10 magnifies the period range from 0.10 year to 0.45 year .",
    "the diagrams were obtained calculating mem curves for a 5-year moving centered window and plotting it in a column using colors to represent the strength of the spectral function .",
    "for example , the colored column above the year 2006 corresponds to the mem power spectrum of the data covering the 5-year period from 2003.5 to 2008.5 .",
    "the presence of harmonics even when attenuated during solar minimum is emphasized by the colored column of figures 9 and 10 , which shows a spectrum normalized by the variance @xmath50 of the data during the analyzed 5-year interval .",
    "figure 9 shows that even after normalization the amplitude of some frequencies depends strongly on the strength of solar cycle activity .",
    "tsi oscillation variability is seen to be larger during solar maxima and smaller during solar minima .",
    "major peaks ( blue - back color ) are observed for the same periodicities seen in figures 4 and 5 , indicated by arrows on the left .",
    "the spectral peaks are relatively stable as the 5-year window moves in time .",
    "the stationarity of these spectral lines increases for periods below 0.5 year .",
    "the peaks near 0.6 - 0.7 year and 0.8 year are attenuated or disappear during solar cycle 23 - 24 minimum ( ~ 2006.75 to 2008.75 ) .",
    "the strong periodicities near 0.8 year are attenuated or disappear during 2008 - 2009.25 .",
    "in particular the peak at 0.6 - 0.65 year is clearly visible before 2006.5 and after 2008.75 in all three diagrams .",
    "some differences are also seen in the three panels of figures 9 and 10 .",
    "the acrim3 panel is the most colorful , indicating the highest detection of variability , and tim is the least ( corresponding to the standard deviation variability depicted in figure 8) .",
    "because the calculations are the same for all three tsi records this implies that the spectral peaks detected by acrim3 are generally stronger that those detected by the other two experiments , providing another confirmation that acrim3 sensors are more sensitive than virgo and tim , recording stronger signals on multiple scales .",
    "acrimsat / acrim3 , soho / virgo and sorce / tim tsi records overlap since 2003.15 and are found to be closely correlated with each other . including the lasp / trf calibration corrections for both acrim3 and virgo , all three records present a similar tsi average at about @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "figure 1 still depicts the soho / virgo record at the uncorrected scale ( at about @xmath51 @xmath27 ) since the virgo updated record is not currently available .",
    "power spectrum and multi - scale dynamical spectral analysis techniques have been used to study the physical properties of these data .",
    "we found that tsi is modulated by major harmonics at : @xmath0 year , @xmath1 year , @xmath2 year , @xmath3 year , @xmath4 year , @xmath5 year ; the peaks occurring at @xmath52 year , @xmath53 year and @xmath54 year appear to be amplified during solar activity cycle maxima and attenuated during the minima .",
    "other researchers have studied the fast oscillations of alternative solar indices and found results compatible with ours .",
    "@xcite found that an index of energetic solar flare events presents a major variable oscillation with a period of about 154 days ( 0.42 year ) .",
    "similarly @xcite found a 152 - 158 day ( 0.41 - 0.43 year ) periodicity in records of solar nuclear gamma ray flares and sunspots .",
    "this period approximately corresponds to the mercury - venus synodic cycle ( @xmath55 year ) , which is quite evident in figures 4 and 5 , and may slightly vary in time as shown in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "@xcite analyzed a number of solar indices ( acrim-1 tsi , 10.7 cm radio flux , ca - k plage index , sunspot blocking function and uv flux at @xmath56 and mgii core - to - wing ratio ) and found major spectral peaks at about 51 days ( @xmath57 year ) , 113 - 117 days ( 0.30 - 0.32 year ) , 150 - 157 days ( 0.41 - 0.43 year ) , 227 days ( @xmath58 year ) and 240 - 330 days ( 0.65 - 0.90 year ) .",

    "the interpretation of the other cycles is uncertain .",
    "perhaps the @xmath9 days ( @xmath10 year ) and ~34 - 35 days ( @xmath15-@xmath16 year ) cycles are the synodic cycles between the equatorial solar rotation cycle and the orbit of jupiter and mercury respectively .",

    "mercury , venus , earth and jupiter would provide the most modulation within the studied time scales @xcite . if these planets are modulating solar activity via gravitational and/or electromagnetic forces , although the physical mechanisms are still unknown , the harmonics referring to the spring , orbital and synodic periods among the planets should be present in the tsi records as well .",
    "the planetary harmonics reported in tables 1 , and 3 , computed using the orbital periods of four theoretically most relevant planets ( mercury , venus , earth and jupiter ) correspond very closely to the harmonics observed in the tsi records ( see figures 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 and 10 ) .",
    "our findings support the hypothesis that planetary forces are modulating solar activity and tsi on multiple time scales .",
    "scafetta proposed a physical mechanism that may explain how the small energy dissipated by the gravitational tides may be significantly amplified up to a 4-million factor by activating a modulation of the solar nuclear fusion rate @xcite .",
    "however , the additional presence of theoretical synodic cycles and an 11-year solar cycle modulation of the sub - annual tsi variability also suggest electromagnetic planet - sun interactions that could more directly drive the solar outer regions .",
    "thus , if the planets are modulating solar activity as our analysis suggests , the solar response to planetary forcing would be complex and would non - linearly depend on the 11-year solar cycle .",

    "<S> herein we adopt a multi - scale dynamical spectral analysis technique to compare and study the dynamical evolution of the harmonic components of the overlapping acrimsat / acrim3 , soho / virgo and sorce / tim total solar irradiance ( tsi ) records during 2003.15 to 2013.16 in solar cycles 23 and 24 . the three tsi time series present highly correlated patterns . </S>",
    "<S> significant power spectral peaks are common to these records and are observed at the following periods : @xmath0 year , @xmath1 year , @xmath2 year , @xmath3 year , @xmath4 year , @xmath5 year . </S>",
    "<S> less certain spectral peaks occur at about @xmath6 year , @xmath7 year and @xmath8 year . </S>",
    "<S> four main frequency periods at @xmath9 days ( @xmath10 year ) , @xmath11 days ( @xmath12 year ) , at @xmath13-@xmath14 days ( @xmath15-@xmath16 year ) and @xmath17-@xmath18 days ( @xmath19-@xmath20 year ) characterize the solar rotation cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of these oscillations , in particular of those with periods larger than @xmath21 year , appears to be modulated by the @xmath2211-year solar cycle . </S>",
    "<S> similar harmonics have been found in other solar indices . </S>",
    "<S> the observed periodicities are found highly coherent with the spring , orbital and synodic periods of mercury , venus , earth and jupiter . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that solar activity is likely modulated by planetary gravitational and electromagnetic forces acting on the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the sun s response to planetary forcing depends non - linearly on the state of internal solar dynamics : planetary - sun coupling effects are enhanced during solar activity maxima and attenuated during minima .    </S>",
