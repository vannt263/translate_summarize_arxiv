    "according to a concordance cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory , dark matter halos hierarchically evolve in an expanding universe .",
    "the smallest dark matter microhalos first undergo gravitational collapse , and then merge to form larger halos .",
    "the size of the smallest halo is determined by the free streaming scale of the dark matter particles .",
    "if dark matter comprises the lightest supersymmetric particle ( the neutralino of mass approximately 100 gev ) , a cutoff in the matter power spectrum of the very early universe should result from free streaming damping of this particle .",
    "the estimated corresponding mass of the smallest microhalos is approximately earth - mass , @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this interval could be increased by uncertainty in supersymmetry theory .",
    "if many earth - mass microhalos exist at present universe , they could significantly enhance gamma - ray signals by neutralino self - annihilation @xcite .",
    "many studies have debated whether gamma - rays generated by neutralino annihilation in subhalos and microhalos are observable in indirect dark matter detection experiments .",
    "since the gamma - ray flux is proportional to the square of the local dark matter density , the annihilation signal from the milky way halo should largely depend on the halo s fine structure .",
    "analytic studies and cosmological simulations have predicted that the subhalo mass function scales as @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although no consensus has yet emerged .",
    "thus , smaller subhalos are abundant in the milky way , and some of them will probably pass near the sun .",
    "the survivability of microhalos and larger subhalos in the milky way depends on their structure .",
    "this suggests that the structure of the smallest microhalos can determine the fine structure of the dark matter halo .",
    "therefore , to evaluate the observable annihilation flux , we must understand the density structures of microhalos .",
    "historically , the structures of relatively large halos ( galaxy - sized to cluster - sized ) have been investigated by cosmological @xmath1-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most works ,",
    "the structures of these halos follow the navarro  frenk  white ( nfw ) profile @xcite or the einasto profile @xcite . in these profiles ,",
    "the slopes of radial density profiles approximate @xmath6 in the inner region , gradually increasing @xmath7 toward the outer region .",
    "some of the above cited studies have estimated the gamma - ray flux from microhalos assuming that microhalos follow these profiles . however , unlike massive halos contain many subhalos , microhalos contain no subhalos by definition and do not form by hierarchical merging of smaller halos .",
    "thus , the structure of microhalos may largely differ from that of larger halos .",
    "the structure of microhalos was first investigated in numerical simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "they successfully fitted the density profiles of microhalos to the form , @xmath8 , where the slope @xmath9 ranges from 1.5 to 2 , down to radii as low as @xmath10 pc .",
    "however , the mass resolution in the simulation of @xcite was @xmath11 , insufficient to resolve the central structures of microhalos .",
    "@xcite improved the mass and spatial resolutions in the earlier study by 100 and 20 times , respectively .",
    "after numerous simulations were performed at the higher resolution , they found that the central density cusps of microhalos scale much more steeply than those of larger halos , with @xmath12 .",
    "these results are supported by recent similar simulations @xcite , in which inner profiles scale as @xmath13 .",
    "such steep cusps in the density profile may largely impact on indirect experimental searches for dark matter .",
    "the contribution of microhalos , based on the density profiles derived from cosmological simulations , are estimated in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , their estimation relies on results of only a few simulated halos .",
    "statistical study , such as the distribution of microhalo density profiles , requires a more extensive dataset .",
    "@xcite analytically estimated that the formation epoch of microhalos is affected by larger scale density fluctuations .",
    "they predicted that the formation epoch of their simulated microhalos was later than the average value .",
    "since halo concentration reflects the cosmic density at which halos collapse , this suggests that their microhalos were less concentrated than indicated by the average .",
    "therefore , to precisely predict the gamma - ray flux , the distribution of both the microhalo density profile shapes and of microhalo concentrations must be elucidated .",
    "the statistics are most effectively improved by simulating larger simulation boxes with uniform mass resolution and unbiasedly analyzing all halos .",
    "although we can now simulate halos with ultra - high resolution by re - simulation method , selection bias is difficult to eliminate , and impedes the acquisition of good statistical samples of microhalos .",
    "another difficulty is resolving the free streaming scale with sufficient resolution .",
    "two - body relaxation introduces numerical artifacts that significantly reduce the central density of microhalos .",
    "artificial fragmentation can occur at filaments below the free streaming scale , as seen in warm dark matter simulations @xcite .",
    "to avoid such numerical artifacts and obtain good statistics of well - resolved halos , substantially many particles are required .",
    "such large simulations are numerically challenging and consume huge computational resources .    despite these difficulties , such simulations are worthy of attempt , since they provide microhalo statistics and yield valuable structural information on halos , whose masses exceed earth - mass by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "these halos are interesting targets since some of them are formed by mergers of microhalos",
    ". these halos could be structurally different from larger halos , and could resemble the smallest microhalos . along with microhalos , these small halos may significantly contribute to the gamma - ray signal .",
    "the structural statistics of these halos may help to elucidate the mass scale at which the density profile transits to steeper cusps .",
    "@xcite performed high - resolution simulation for a @xmath14 halo and analyzed it .",
    "however , there is only one halo , statistical study over a wide mass range is needed .",
    "another interesting point is that our simulations are closely related to warm dark matter simulations .",
    "our simulations would give a huge opportunity to understand warm dark matter halos , since the cutoff in the matter power spectrum is imposed by a similar mechanism , although mass scales are largely different .",
    "we address these questions by large and high resolution cosmological @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "we present the first study of halo structure near the free streaming scale over a wide mass range . to reveal the statistics of these halos in the early universe , we simulated a large number of dark matter particles in sufficient volumes to reliably sample these halos . ",
    "[ sec : method ] describes our simulation method and its setup .",
    "the structures of halos near the free streaming scale , density profiles , profile distributions , dependence on the halo formation epoch , and halo evolution are presented in  [ sec : result ] .",
    "the contributions of these halos to gamma - ray signals by neutralino self - annihilation is discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the results are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we performed three large cosmological @xmath1-body simulations . the cosmological parameters , namely , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , were based on the concordance @xmath19cdm model @xcite .",
    "two different initial matter power spectra were used . in two of the simulations ,",

    "the third simulation ignored the effect of free streaming damping .",
    "we denote the former two simulations as model a , and the latter as model b. the initial conditions were generated by a first - order zeldovich approximation at @xmath20 .    in the model a simulations ( with the cutoff imposed ) , the motions of @xmath21 particles in comoving boxes of side lengths 400",
    "pc and 200 pc were followed ( these simulations are denoted a_n4096l400  and a_n4096l200 , respectively ) .",
    "the particle masses were @xmath22 and @xmath23 , ensuring that halos at the free streaming scale were represented by @xmath24 and @xmath25 particles , respectively .",
    "such high resolution protects the halos from the artificial fragmentation as seen in warm dark matter simulations @xcite .",
    "the respective gravitational plummer softening lengths were @xmath26 pc and @xmath27 pc .",
    "the model b simulation ( with no cutoff ) followed the motions of @xmath28 particles in comoving boxes of side length 200 pc ( this simulation is denoted b_n2048l200 ) .",
    "the particle mass was @xmath29 , and the gravitational plummer softening length was @xmath30 pc .",
    "simulations a_n4096l400  and b_n2048l200  were performed at the same mass and spatial resolution , since both the number of particles and the simulated volume of simulation b_n2048l200  were 1/8 those of simulation a_n4096l400 .",
    "to avoid unphysical density fluctuations at small scales @xcite , thermal velocities was not imposed in the initial conditions .",
    "the setup of the three simulations is detailed in table [ tab1 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : prof_evo ] plots the evolution of density structures of these halos .",
    "the density structures are clearly stable from a few @xmath31 to @xmath32 . beyond @xmath32 ,",
    "the outskirts of all halos expand and the density profile appears to follow @xmath33 , because the outskirt of each original halo was confined within @xmath34 .",
    "when a halo suddenly loses its outskirt , it experiences strong gravitational disturbance and establishes a new equilibrium state .",
    "this situation naturally leads to @xmath35 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this scenario may be unrealistic in the cosmological context , since continuous infall of matter and intermittent merger processes occur , which would increase the densities in outer regions .    around @xmath31 ,",
    "slight density decreases are observed at @xmath36 .",
    "these decreases are obviously numerical artifacts introduced by two - body relaxation .",
    "therefore , the density structures with steep cusps appear to be stable rather than transient , and exist in an equilibrium state .    from these results",
    ", we can infer how these halos born in the early universe exist at present .",
    "if these halos remain sufficiently isolated from larger systems , they should wander throughout the universe while retaining their steep cusps .",
    "if captured by larger systems and exist as subhalos , their densities will be altered by tides from the larger systems . since",
    "tidal mass loss mainly occurs in the outer regions @xcite , the high central density of these halos would remain after captured by the larger system .",
    "finally , what subhalo mass function can we observe in a halo as massive as the milky way halo ?",
    "in high resolution simulations of such halos , the mass function appeared to scale as @xmath37 , although this trend is not conclusive ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , none of previous simulations could resolve the free streaming scale , since earth mass halos are smaller than milky way mass halos by 18 orders of magnitude .",
    "subhalos resolved in previous simulations have similar density structures to those of their host halo .",
    "since these subhalos are much larger than the cdm cutoff scale , single slope in their mass function is expected . however , whether similar mass functions apply to halos near the cutoff scale is unclear , since the cusp in halos near the free streaming scale are steeper than those in larger halos .    in the a_n4096l400  simulation ,",
    "more than thirty halos contained than 10 million particles at @xmath38 , sufficient for analyzing the mass function and the spatial distribution of subhalos .",
    "the statistics of these subhalos will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity of a halo by neutralino self - annihilation seen from a distant observer is calculated by the volume integral of the density squared .",
    "any subhalos boost the annihilation luminosity of a halo and the boost factor @xmath39 is defined as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath40 \\ , l(m ) \\ , dm ,   \\label{eq : bf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath41 is the annihilation luminosity of a halo of mass @xmath42 without subhalos , and @xmath43 is the subhalo mass function .",
    "the boost factor of a milky way sized halo has been estimated by many studies and ranges from a few to several tens ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some works give several hundreds @xcite .",
    "in many early studies , annihilation luminosities and boost factors , have been evaluated assuming that halos near the free streaming scale follow the nfw profile .",
    "the steeper cusps obtained in our simulations could significantly enhance the signals . in this section ,",
    "we evaluate boost factors using the density profiles obtained in our simulations .",
    "however , many uncertainties , the evolution of these halos in the milky way , subhalo mass function , and the profile of the milky way halo , weaken the reliability of estimation .",
    "nevertheless , such estimation is worthy to attempt and gives us some insights about the boost factor .    as models of halos near the free streaming scale , we consider three models .    1 .   _ eq[eq : doublepower]_c1p35_. the profile of equation ( [ eq : doublepower ] ) with the mass  shape relation of equation ( [ eq : fita ] ) , and the constant concentration @xmath44 at @xmath38 , consistent with our cutoff simulation .",
    "eq[eq : doublepower]_cnfw_. the profile of equation ( [ eq : doublepower ] ) with the mass  shape relation of equation ( [ eq : fita ] ) , and the mass  concentration relation proposed by @xcite .",

    "the inner shape becomes @xmath45 at the mass @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the density profile is identical to the nfw profile above this mass scale .",
    "we used the subhalo mass function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , corresponding normalization factors are @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and calculated the annihilation luminosity of each mass halo by numerically integrating the square of equation ( [ eq : doublepower ] ) within the range @xmath51 pc to @xmath32 , with the parameters of adopted model .",
    "then the boost factor was calculated by numerically integrating equation ( [ eq : bf ] ) from @xmath52 under the condition @xmath53 .",
    "gives upper three curves .",
    "the subhalo mass function @xmath54 gives lower three curves .",
    ", width=321 ]    figure [ fig : bf ] shows the annihilation boost factor as a function of the halo mass .",
    "the result of nfw_cnfw  model is identical to that shown in @xcite",
    ". the models with steeper inner ( eq[eq : doublepower]_c1p35  and eq[eq : doublepower]_cnfw ) raise the boost factor moderately . the model eq[eq : doublepower]_c1p35  gives larger enhancement than the model eq[eq : doublepower]_cnfw , since its concentrations are larger as seen in figure [ fig : m - c_fit ] .",
    "the boost factors of a milky way sized halo ( @xmath55 ) with the @xmath56 subhalo mass function are @xmath57 and @xmath58 for models of nfw_cnfw , eq[eq : doublepower]_cnfw  and eq[eq : doublepower]_c1p35 , respectively .",
    "those with the @xmath47 subhalo mass function are @xmath59 and @xmath60 . strongly depending on the subhalo mass function and the adopted concentration model , the steeper inner cusps of halos near the free streaming scale enhance the annihilation luminosity of a milky way sized halo between 12% to 67% .",
    "when simple single power law mass  concentration relations are extrapolated to microhalo scales , the resulting boost factor is several hundreds for a milky way sized halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath61 for a cluster sized halo @xcite .",
    "such very large boost factors are clearly ruled out as seen in figure [ fig : bf ] , since our high resolution simulations rule out single power law mass  concentration relations .",
    "the scatter in the density profiles seen in figures [ fig : m - alpha_bin ] and [ fig : m - c_bin ] could influence the boost factor . to evaluate the effect of the scatter , we calculated the annihilation luminosity of each simulated halo by numerically integrating the square of equation ( [ eq : doublepower ] ) , with the parameters obtained in the fitting of each halo .",
    "we find that the average luminosity is 28% smaller than that we do not consider the scatter .",
    "thus , the scatter in the density profiles would not cause large effect on the boost factors .",
    "our work has improved the accuracy of the estimation of the boost factor .",
    "however , some uncertainties still exist .",
    "it is unclear whether the subhalo mass function can be extrapolated to the scale of microhalos , since the central density cusp is steeper in these halos than in larger halos .",
    "the boost factor strongly depends on the cutoff mass scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further studies about the evolution of microhalos in larger halos and a cutoff scale independent model of density profiles , are required to estimate the boost factor more robustly .",
    "our studies are closely related to warm dark matter simulations .",
    "although mass scales are largely different , the mechanism to impose the cutoff in the matter power spectrum is similar .",
    "thus , the structure of halos near the cutoff scale of warm dark matter particles should be similar to those obtained in our simulations .",
    "the mass  shape relation of equation ( [ eq : fita ] ) predicts that the slopes with the cutoff and no cutoff models are similar at around @xmath62 , which is about three orders larger than the cutoff scale .",
    "this prediction is consistent with recent warm dark matter simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that gave density profiles similar to the nfw profile for the milky way mass halos , which are larger than the cutoff scale of warm dark matter particles by three orders of magnitude .",
    "our results indicate that the cusps of warm dark matter halos below the milky way mass would be steeper than that of the nfw profile .",
    "however , there is an absence of simulation data .",
    "our understanding of halo structures will advance by high resolution warm dark matter simulations , which resolve halos near its cutoff scale .",
    "by means of unprecedentedly large cosmological @xmath1-body simulations , we studied the structures of dark matter halos near the free streaming scale over a wide mass range ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "these simulations enable to resolve halos with sufficient resolution and cover volumes large enough to perform statistical studies .",
    "two different initial matter power spectra were adopted , one accounting for the free streaming damping , the other ignoring this effect .",

    ".   the central cusp of the smallest microhalos scales as @xmath0 , much steeper than that of the nfw profile , but consistent with previous works @xcite .",
    "the central cusp becomes gradually shallower as the halo mass increases . for halos of mass @xmath64 ,",
    "the central slope is around @xmath2 .",
    "the density profiles of these halos are not well fitted by the nfw profile , but can be fitted to a double power law function ( equation ( [ eq : doublepower ] ) ) . within the mass range of this study , the shape parameter @xmath65",
    "is given as @xmath66 .",
    "3 .   the concentration parameter shows little dependence on the halo mass within the mass range of this study .",
    "the median concentration in the cutoff and the no cutoff models ranges @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , corresponding to conventional concentrations ( based on the nfw profile at @xmath69 ) of @xmath70 .",
    "these results support suggestions that the concentration does not depend on mass in a single power law fashion .",
    "4 .   no strong correlation exists between the slope and the collapse epoch , indicating that halo collapse is not important in determining the shape of the density profile .",
    "the density profile does not evolve self - similarly , unlike larger halos such as galaxy - sized and cluster - sized halos . shortly after collapse ,",
    "the cusps are steeper and their profiles are similar to those of the smallest halos .",
