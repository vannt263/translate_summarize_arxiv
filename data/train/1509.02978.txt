    "the groups @xmath13 are denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "they are , unsurprisingly , called the @xmath15-groups of @xmath1 ( they are also called @xmath16-groups in the literature and may be denoted by @xmath17 ) . in section [ prelim ] , we will discuss notation and various definitions of @xmath9-groups needed in the computation of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the subcategory of @xmath19 of finitely generated projective @xmath1-modules .",

    "it is of interest to understand the properties of this induced homomorphism , in particular , when is this map an isomorphism ?",
    "this is precisely the case when @xmath1 is regular , following immediately from quillen s resolution theorem ( @xcite ,  theorem 3 ) .",
    "however , regular local rings are exceptionally well - behaved , so one can not expect this behavior in general . in fact , it has been well - known that @xmath23 isomorphic to @xmath24 ( see ( @xcite , theorem 1.3.11 ) ) , but what of @xmath22 ?",
    "it is well - known that @xmath22 is just the grothendieck group of the category @xmath19 and if we impose the condition that @xmath1 has _ finite cohen - macaulay type _ ( that is , there are , up to isomorphism , finitely many indecomposable maximal cohen - macaulay modules ) the structure of @xmath22 is elucidated in the following theorem .",
    "[ k0mod](@xcite , theorem 13.7 )    suppose there are @xmath25 non - free indecomposable maximal cohen - macaulay @xmath1-modules and denote by @xmath26 the free abelian group on the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable maximal cohen - macaulay @xmath1-modules .",
    "the map @xmath27 given by @xmath28 $ ] is surjective and its kernel is generated by    @xmath29    and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the auslander - reiten homomorphism .",
    "the immense usefulness of theorem [ k0mod ] lies in the fact that the computation of @xmath22 has been reduced to linear algebra , as the auslander - reiten homomorphism can be readily computed from the auslander - reiten quiver .",
    "this quickly leads to the explicit computation of @xmath22 for all simple singularities of finite type ( see @xcite , proposition 13.10 ) .",
    "one can quickly see that these groups are often not @xmath24 .    moving up one rung on the @xmath9-theory ladder , it is well - known that @xmath32 ( see ( @xcite , example 1.6 ) ) .",
    "however , the structure of @xmath8 was not known for some time until the work of h. holm @xcite and @xcite . in the former ,",
    "computing @xmath8 was carried out over an @xmath1 which has finite representation type and it was found that @xmath8 could be computed as a specified quotient of @xmath33 , with @xmath34 a representation generator for the category @xmath2 . in the latter , the key ingredient to the computation of these @xmath15-groups was found : an @xmath3-cluster tilting object .",
    "the definition of an @xmath3-cluster tilting object is technical ( see definition [ ncluster ] ) , but generalizes the condition that @xmath1 has finite cohen - macaulay type .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 has finite cohen - macaulay type if and only if @xmath2 has a @xmath35-cluster tilting object .",

    "the long exact sequence ends in presentation    @xmath43    of @xmath22 . since @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the presentation of @xmath22 given above is precisely the one given in theorem [ k0mod ] when @xmath4 is an additive generator of @xmath2 .",
    "hence theorem [ viraj ] generalizes theorem [ k0mod ] .",
    "in fact , we show in section [ struck1 ] that utilizing theorem [ viraj ] and techniques from @xcite , we can generalize the results of @xcite on the structure of @xmath8 .",

    "the utility of theorem [ thmg1 ] is that the computation of @xmath8 for some hypersurface singularities becomes more tractable , as well as removing the necessity of the injectivity of the auslander - reiten homomorphism @xmath52 required in @xcite .",

    "in fact , all of the rings for which we compute @xmath8 are complete , so they already satisfy ( a ) ( see ( @xcite , corollary 1.9 ) ) .",
