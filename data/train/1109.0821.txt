    "first order transition as a state transformation of substances is observed in our everyday life , such as evaporation / condensation and melting / freezing .",
    "the thermodynamic mechanism of such transition is very clear ; a phase transition occurs when the state of the lowest free energy alternates from one thermodynamic state to another by changing a certain environmental parameter . but",
    "dynamics of the transition is rather complicated and our knowledge can not be said to be sufficient .",
    "since the initial and final state is completely different unlike a second order transition , nucleation and large scale domain growth , i.e. , invasion of the metastable state by the most stable state , is observed in the vicinity of the transition point , which includes various mechanisms depending on the spatio - temporal scale @xcite .",
    "this is essentially nonequilibrium phenomena and the dynamics is difficult to understand by relating it to the well - understood equilibrium state near the transition point .",
    "there is a droplet formation phenomena , however , that can be discussed in an equilibrium framework as mentioned in the following .",
    "it can be a good starting point to understand first order transition dynamics .    about first order transition , we usually imagine discontinuous transformation with hysteresis controlled by intensive variable such as temperature , pressure and magnetic field .",
    "but once we constrain one conjugate extensive variable , such as internal energy , particle density and magnetization , and take it as a control variable , a coexisting phase is inserted in the phase diagram between two homogeneous phases and the transitions becomes continuous ; the volume fraction of one phase continuously changes from zero to unity between the two edges of the coexisting phase .",
    "it is pointed out , however , that a droplet , which is a condensed domain of the minority state in phase separation , is not stable unless its volume is larger than a certain threshold and therefore there is a discontinuous droplet condensation transition @xcite .",
    "this is basically due to that the surface free energy of the droplet is not negligible in a finite size system .",
    "therefore the threshold volume of @xmath0-dimensional droplet depends on the system size , proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a linear dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "although this threshold can be neglected in comparison with the whole system volume @xmath3 in an infinite size system , it actually diverges with @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the infinite size limit of the droplet condensation transition is well - defined if we observe the phenomena with proper size scale .",
    "it should be noted that the equilibrium droplet condensation in a large size system always contain single droplet in contrast with nonequilibrium transition where multiple droplets appear .",
    "the supersaturation state , where condensation is avoided due to small volume of minority state , is related to the metastable state under fixed intensive parameter condition .",
    "biskup @xcite and binder @xcite made quantitative analysis of the equilibrium droplet condensation transition which is supported by a number of numerical studies of lenard - jones particles @xcite and lattice gas @xcite where particle density is constrained at given temperature .",
    "in this paper we consider a simpler situation where relevant extensive variable is only internal energy ( magnetization is not taken account of ) and treat the equilibrium state with constrained energy , i.e. , microcanonical ensemble @xcite . by large scale numerical simulations of the two dimensional potts model with the wang - landau sampling",
    ", we try to determine the large size limit of the droplet condensation transition , which has been rather difficult in small size systems @xcite .",
    "we investigate the ferromagnetic @xmath4-state potts model @xcite on @xmath5 square lattice with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the interaction energy for the nearest neighbor pairs is written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 means kronecker s delta and the spin variable @xmath8 takes integer value @xmath9 .",
    "this model in canonical ensemble exhibits paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition at @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the transition is of second order for @xmath12 and of first order for @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath4 is not sufficiently larger than 4 , the correlation length of fluctuation is considerably large around the transition point and critical like fluctuation is observed to some extent .",
    "it is better to choose large @xmath4 to investigate the pure nature of a first order transition .",
    "but the amount of computation for equilibration becomes larger with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "we perform the wang - landau sampling simulations @xcite , which yields the density(number ) of states @xmath14 , as a result of learning process to realize a flat energy histogram .",
    "the density of states enables us to calculate the helmholtz s free energy in canonical ensemble as @xmath15 $ ] , and its derivatives , i.e. , mean energy and specific heat .",
    "the energy with maximum or minimum realization probability is given as a solution of @xmath16/ \\round e=0 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , in microcanonical ensemble for given internal energy , fundamental thermodynamic function is microcanonical entropy @xmath18 and ( inverse ) microcanonical temperature is a quantity to be observed , which is defined as a response to energy perturbation as @xmath19 this is equivalent to the extremal condition for the free energy in canonical ensemble .",
    "the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath21 in microcanonical ensemble is not exactly related to the @xmath21 dependence of _ expectation _ value of @xmath20 in canonical ensemble except in the thermodynamic limit but is exactly related to the @xmath21-dependence of the _ extremal _ value of @xmath20 even in the finite size system .",

    "is always rejected .",
    "since the time needed to diffuse the energy range @xmath27 by random walk is proportional to @xmath28 , the time needed to obtain flat histogram is inversely proportional to the square of the number of threads .",
    "although this method drastically reduces the total monte - carlo steps , we have to care about the possibility that a flat histogram is established in monte - carlo steps shorter than the relaxation time of the system .",
    "this occurs when the energy region is divided into too small parts .",
    "another problem of the division of energy region is that it possibly causes the segmentation of the phase space , i.e. , there are spin configurations which can not be visited depending on the initial condition .    in order to enhance the relaxation and guarantees ergodicity , we make overlapping energy region for neighboring threads as illustrated in fig .",
