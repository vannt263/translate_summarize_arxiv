    "millimeter wavelength co and submillimeter dust continuum searches offer an alternative , extinction - free way of detecting high redshift proto - galaxies ( see yun & scoville 1996 , evans et al . 1996 , @xcite ) .",
    "the first detection of co emission from a cosmological distance was reported by brown & vanden bout ( 1991 ) and by solomon et al .",

    "the extended nature of the co emission was later revealed by high resolution imaging ( @xcite ) . in a unique study exploiting the magnifying property of gravitational lensing , the total gas mass and the detailed distribution of molecular gas in the z=2.6 quasar h  1413 + 117 were determined ( yun et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the derived gas properties are indeed remarkably similar to the ir luminous galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath8 1 kpc , @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath11 50 - 100 k ) .",
    "the compact and concentrated gas distribution suggests that the rapid metal enrichment of interstellar medium by a massive starburst may explain the strong co emission .",
    "redshifted co emission has subsequently been detected in the z=4.7 quasar br  1202@xmath120725 ( @xcite ) and in the @xmath13 radio galaxy 53w002 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hyperluminous infrared galaxy fsc  15307 + 3252 at @xmath14 is the second highest redshift object detected by iras and one of the most luminous galaxies known ( @xmath15 , cutri et al .",
    "both the optical spectrum ( seyfert 2 ) and the radio continuum power ( log @xmath16 w hz@xmath17  from the vla first survey by @xcite ) suggest some nuclear activity , and the presence of polarized , broad optical emission lines suggests that this galaxy may host an obscured qso ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed properties of fsc  15307 + 3252 , including the spectral energy distribution dominated by the infrared , are nearly identical to the more distant iras galaxy fsc  10214 + 4724 , where bright ( lensed ) co emission has already been detected . in general ,",
    "strong dust emission is one of the best indicators of a large molecular gas content , and the large 60 @xmath1 m luminosity and infrared - to - optical luminosity ratio suggest that fsc  15307 + 3252 is also a high redshift dusty , gas - rich galaxy .",
    "therefore we have conducted a search for redshifted co ( 43 ) emission and submillimeter continuum emission at @xmath18 m using the owens valley millimeter array between december 1996 and february 1997 . here",
    "we report the results of our search and the inferences on the dust and molecular gas content in this hyperluminous infrared galaxy .",

    "the array consists of six 10.4 m telescopes , and the longest baseline observed was 120 m. the redshifted co ( 43 ) transition occurs at 239.41 ghz , and the primary beam of the 10.4-m telescope is 24.9   ( 140 kpc at @xmath19 gpc mpc  [ km s@xmath17]@xmath17 and @xmath21 throughout this paper . ] ) at this frequency .",
    "the system temperatures were typically 600900 k in the signal side - band corrected for antenna and atmospheric losses and for atmospheric incoherence .",
    "spectral resolution was provided by a digital correlator configured with 120@xmath224 mhz channels ( 5.0 ) , covering a total velocity range of 600 km s@xmath17 .",
    "the 239.4 ghz continuum emission was measured using a 1 ghz bandwidth analog correlator , and the 3 mm continuum emission centered on 102.1 ghz was measured simultaneously using the 3 mm sis receivers ( @xmath23 = 200400 k ) .",
    "the total usable integration time on source was 19 hours distributed over 4 tracks in the two different telescope configurations .",
    "the nearby quasar 1611 + 343 ( 1.0 & 0.8 jy at 102 & 239 ghz ) was used to track the phase and gain variations .",
    "neptune ( t@xmath24=90 k ) and 3c  273 were observed for absolute flux calibration  see table 1 for the observation summary .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard owens valley array program mma ( @xcite ) and mapped using difmap ( @xcite ) and the nrao aips package .",
    "we searched for co @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ghz ) line emission in the redshift range z=0.9240 - 0.9275 , but no co emission was detected .",
    "the rms noise in each 80 mhz ( @xmath27 ) channel was 9 mjy beam@xmath17 ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "this is about 1/2 or 1/3 of the amount of molecular gas found in the ultraluminous infrared galaxies such as arp  220 ( see @xcite ) and a factor two better than the upper limits reported by evans et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from their iram 30-m telescope observations .",
    "it is possible that the co emission occurs at a redshift significantly different from the uv / optical emission line redshift we searched .",
    "however , the near - infrared spectroscopy of the narrow emission lines by evans et al .",
    "( 1998 ) confirms the redshift determined earlier by cutri et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and it is therefore likely that the co emission in fsc  15307 + 3252 is intrinsically weak .",
    "the continuum emission at 102 ghz and 239 ghz were measured simultaneously with the spectral line data using the analog continuum correlator with 1 ghz bandwidth .",
    "the rms noise estimated from the natural - weighted image was 0.43 mjy beam@xmath17 at 102 ghz and 1.7 mjy beam@xmath17 at 239 ghz .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of fsc  15307 + 3252 is shown in figure  2 including the 3@xmath2 upper limits of 1.3 mjy and 5.1 mjy at @xmath31 of 1500 @xmath1 m and 650 @xmath1 m and the photometric data from cutri et al .",

    "if the spectral break occurs at @xmath34 m , however , it would clearly exceed the theoretical limit ( @xmath35 ) even if the 650 @xmath1 m flux is close to the 3@xmath2 upper limit reported here , leaving thermal dust emission from a large amount of dust as the only reasonable explanation for the large fir / submillimeter luminosity .",
    "the observed fir and submillimeter sed can be described well by the thermal continuum emission from @xmath36 k dust with emissivity @xmath37 ( see below for a further discussion ) .",
    "the flux density , @xmath38 , from a cloud at a distance @xmath39 containing @xmath40 spherical dust grains each of cross - section @xmath2 , temperature @xmath41 , and emissivity @xmath42 , is given by @xmath43 q(\\nu ) b(\\nu , t)\\ ] ] the dust cloud mass can be obtained as the product of @xmath40 , the assumed mean dust mass density @xmath44 , and the mean volume of each dust particle @xmath45 .",
    "the dust volume @xmath45 can be related to the grain cross - section @xmath2 in eq . 1 , and the dust mass can be obtained from the observed flux as @xmath46[(4/3)a / q(\\nu)]\\rho\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the grain radius ( see hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "the mass opacity coefficient @xmath48^{-1}$ ] may be strongly dependent on frequency and dust composition , and its estimate and resulting dust mass are uncertain by a factor of at least three ( see @xcite ) .",

    "2 becomes @xmath51~m_\\odot\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the 250 @xmath1 m flux density in jy and @xmath53 is the luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "the continuum flux limits we obtained at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths provide a useful constraint on the temperature , emissivity , and mass of the cold dust associated with fsc  15307 + 3252 . for the gas rich infrared luminous galaxies such as arp  220 ,",
    "the observed sed is consistent with the optical depth reaching unity near @xmath54 m ( @xcite ) , and a high opacity at these wavelengths is also suggested by the faintness of 158 @xmath1 m [ c ii ] fine structure line emission observed in such galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore model the observed fir and submillimeter sed as the combination of a pure black - body spectrum at short wavelengths and a grey - body spectrum with emissivity @xmath55 between 1 and 2 for the long wavelengths , with the transition occurring between 100 and 200 @xmath1 m .",
    "three different  good \" dust emission models for fsc  15307 + 3252 are listed in table  2 and plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the iras 60 and 100 @xmath1 m ( @xmath31 = 31 and 52 @xmath1 m ) data are well fit by a pure black - body spectrum ( @xmath56 ) with dust temperature of 85 k. at longer wavelengths , dust emission from 35 k dust with emissivity @xmath57 ( model a ) is consistent with the @xmath18 m upper limit and the 85 k black - body spectrum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this also represents the maximum dust mass case ( @xmath58 ) among the variety of models considered because it has the lowest @xmath59 and predicts the largest 250 @xmath1 m flux ( see eq .",
    "other @xmath57 models with @xmath60 k and bound by the @xmath18 m upper limit do not connect smoothly with the 85 k black - body spectrum ( iras data ) .",
    "the actual observed spectra of luminous infrared galaxies such as arp  220 and fsc  10214 + 4724 are well described by a dust model with emissivity @xmath61 ( see table  3 ) .",
    "a @xmath62 model and @xmath63 k ( model b ) is also consistent with the @xmath18 m upper limit and the 85 k black - body spectrum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the derived dust mass is about 40% smaller than model  a mainly due to higher dust temperature .    given the limited data available , an exhaustive search for the best model is not warranted , and the  good \" dust models shown here are not unique .",
    "nevertheless some meaningful limits on the dust temperature and emissivity can be set by the observations .",
    "for example , a dust spectrum with @xmath63 k and emissivity @xmath64 produces too much 650 @xmath1 m emission when connected smoothly with the black - body spectrum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "similarly , model spectra with @xmath65 k and @xmath66 are excluded by the data . using these constraints , a minimum dust mass model with the highest @xmath59 allowed by the iras data points and the largest @xmath55 physically meaningful",
    "may be constructed and is shown as model c in table  2 and figure  2 .",
    "the minimum dust mass for fsc  15307 + 3252 ( model c ) is @xmath67 , which is about 1/4 of the maximum dust mass in model  a.    in summary , a wide range of possible dust models considered here have produced a relatively narrow range of total dust mass for fsc  15307 + 3252 .",
    "a few clarifying remarks should made here , however .",
    "first of all , our modeling offers a robust estimate for the _ total _ dust mass as the cold dust component in the submillimeter band dominates the total dust mass .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the apparent difference in the observed flux density between the 85 k and 200 k dust component is only a factor of three near @xmath68 hz ( see figure  2 ) but the warmer component accounts for only about 1% in dust mass because of strong temperature dependence on flux density .",
    "secondly , while it is conceivable that a much larger quantity of extremely cold dust may be present in this galaxy for the same reason , the dust models listed in table  2 are nevertheless the most relevant in understanding the nature of fsc  15307 + 3252 . in theory , there could be an arbitrarily large amount of dust at or near the cosmic background temperature ( @xmath69  k ) because such a dust component would not contribute much to the observed sed . on the other hand , such cold dust ,",
    "if present , would not be found in the area of the galaxy associated with the strong heating , and it would be irrelevant to the physics of energetic processes observed in this galaxy .",
    "therefore the relevant maximum total dust mass for fsc  15307 + 3252 is about @xmath70 .",
    "the extremely dusty nature of fsc  15307 + 3252 is easily seen when it is compared to the two well studied infrared luminous galaxies fsc  10214 + 4724 and arp  220 . as summarized in table  3 ,",
    "the fir luminosity of fsc  15307 + 3252 is 10 times larger than arp  220 while their optical b band luminosities are comparable .",
    "the @xmath71 ratio of 650 is about four times larger than both fsc  10214 + 4724 and arp  220 , and the dominance of the fir in its bolometric luminosity is the most extreme among all known objects .    for optically thick black - body emission ( at @xmath72 m ) originating from a single source with a radius @xmath73",
    ", the source size can be determined as @xmath74^{1/2}$ ]  for a distributed source , this radius corresponds to @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the effective area of the optically thick clouds . for fsc  15307 + 3252 at @xmath77 gpc and @xmath78 mjy in the iras 100 @xmath1 m band ,",
    "the black body radius is 370 pc for @xmath79 k. in arp  220 , the 100 @xmath1 m black body radius is 180 pc , which is comparable to the size of the nuclear molecular gas complex ( @xmath80 pc  @xcite ) .",
    "the size of the co emitting region inferred from the gravitational lensing model for the cloverleaf quasar at @xmath81 ( h  1413 + 117 ; @xcite ) is also similar .",
    "both arp  220 and fsc  10214 + 4724 are gas rich systems with molecular gas contents in excess of @xmath82 and gas - to - dust ratios of 260 & 500 , respectively .",
    "these ratios are typical of luminous infrared galaxies in the iras bright galaxy sample ( @xmath83 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , given its large infrared luminosity it is surprising that no co emission is detected in fsc  15307 + 3252 by our observations .",
    "the @xmath84 upper limit on its co luminosity implies an upper limit on molecular gas mass of @xmath85 , which is less than the typical molecular gas content in infrared luminous galaxies like arp  220 even though its fir luminosity is nearly 10 times larger . the well known relationship between the fir and co luminosity",
    "( see review by young & scoville 1991 ) has a second order trend of increasing @xmath86 [ equivalently , @xmath87 ratio with increasing infrared luminosity .",
    "the observed large @xmath86 ratio in fsc  15307 + 3252 is generally consistent with this trend , but the observed co luminosity is still at least 10 times too small compared to the predicted relation .",
    "therefore , the fir emission in fsc  15307 + 3252 has a clear and large excess over the mechanisms operating in other infrared luminous galaxies such as arp  220 .",
    "a possible explanation for the enhanced fir luminosity and apparent large @xmath88 ratio ( @xmath89 ) is that the mean dust temperature is globally higher in fsc  15307 + 3252 compared to other infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "the dust models most consistent with the sed for fsc  15307 + 3252 have dust temperatures 10 to 20 k warmer than in arp  220 ( @xmath90 k , @xmath91 for @xmath92 m and @xmath93 k for @xmath94 m  @xcite ) .",
    "the flux density ( or luminosity ) has an exponential dependence on dust temperature ( see eq .",
    "3 ) , and a relatively small increase in mean dust temperature can dramatically increase the observed fir luminosity even without any increase in the total dust mass",
    ". the inferred gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath95 60 - 250 from the dust model (  4.1 ) is somewhat low but still consistent with the ratios seen in other galaxies .      while arp  220 and other ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the local universe are typically ongoing mergers of two gas rich spiral galaxies ( see hibbard & yun 1998 ) , fsc  15307 + 3252 appears to be a giant elliptical galaxy , with possible companions ( @xcite ) . while the observed gas and dust properties of fsc  15307 + 3252 are consistent with those of infrared luminous galaxies , the absence of bright co emission ( and resulting extreme @xmath88 ratio ) and the presence of a buried luminous agn ( @xcite ) warrant comparisons with other types of objects . in particular",
    ", we compare the observed properties of fsc  15307 + 3252 with other infrared bright giant elliptical - like galaxies hosting a luminous agn .    the giant central galaxy of the perseus cluster , ngc  1275 ( perseus  a , 3c  84 ) , offers an interesting comparison as it is a well known infrared source whose cold gas content is also well documented ( @xmath96 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have constructed the sed for this galaxy from the literature and the ovro and vla archival flux databases ( the central radio source was in its quiescent phase during the winter observing season of 1997 - 1998 ) .",
    "its cold dust content is estimated by subtracting a smooth polynomial component ( non - thermal contribution from the agn ) from the observed fir sed .",
    "as summarized in table  3 , the observed submillimeter - fir sed can be modeled as dust emission arising from relatively cool dust ( @xmath97 k ) with a total mass of about @xmath98 .",
    "the optical luminosity of the underlying galaxy is nearly identical to that of fsc  15307 + 3252 , but both the total fir luminosity and the dust mass are considerably lower ( by factors of 260 and 40 , respectively ) .",
    "high resolution studies of molecular gas and fir emission have shown that the associated star forming activity occurs spread over a 10 kpc area in ngc  1275 ( @xcite ) , and this explains the low @xmath88 ratio ( 8.3 ) and low dust temperature .",
    "part of the observed infrared emission may also arise in the foreground system currently colliding onto ngc  1275 ( see minkowski 1957 , caulet et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the radio galaxy cygnus  a offers another interesting comparison since it is a giant elliptical galaxy hosting a buried quasar nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical luminosity of the host galaxy in cygnus  a is about 3 times fainter than fsc  15307 + 3252 , but most of its total luminosity emerges in the infrared ( @xmath99 ) as in fsc  15307 + 3252 .",
    "the sed of cygnus  a , excluding the contribution from the radio lobes , is shown in figure  3 , and the observed submillimeter - fir sed can be modeled as thermal emission arising from about @xmath100 of dust with @xmath101 k. again , both the fir luminosity and total dust mass are considerably less than those of fsc  15307 + 3252 ( by factors of 76 and 40 , respectively ) .",
    "previous co observations have reported only upper limits for the molecular gas mass ( @xmath102 , @xcite ) . given its low dust mass , at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity",
    "will be needed .      in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ,",
    "the highly luminous activity originating from the central region less than 1 kpc in size is opaque even at fir wavelengths ( @xmath103 ) , and a hotly debated issue is whether the hidden source of luminosity is a massive starburst or an agn .",
    "there is little doubt that young massive stars are forming within the massive central gas complexes in all cases , and evidence for an agn , such as broad emission lines or excess radio emission , is present some of the luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the difficult unresolved issue , however , is whether a starburst or an agn is the dominant source of the observed luminosity .    for the luminous infrared galaxies where the majority of the bolometric luminosity emerges in the infrared , the ratio of infrared luminosity to total gas mass ( @xmath88 ) is a measure of efficiency of converting gas mass into luminosity ( @xcite ) . for a starburst population with a reasonable imf",
    ", the ratio @xmath104 should be less than @xmath105 ( @xcite ) , and objects with an @xmath88 ratio @xmath106 require a significant luminosity contribution from an active nucleus .    among the galaxies discussed above , only upper limits on the gas mass",
    "exist for fsc  15307 + 3252 and cygnus  a. however , the ratio @xmath7 can still be examined . as shown in table  3",
    ", this ratio for fsc  10214 + 4724 , fsc  15307 + 3252 , and cygnus  a is 4 to 15 times larger than for arp  220 and approaches the limit of 500 @xmath107 ( assuming a reasonable gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath108 ) , which is difficult to explain with a starburst alone .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising as all three sources probably host a quasar - like luminous agn . in ngc  1275",
    ", the @xmath7 ratio is similar to that of arp  220 , but the situation is not clear because the bulk of the gas and dust may lie well outside the influence of the agn .",
    "lastly , it is worth noting that there is a growing list of high redshift galaxies with a clear submillimeter dust continuum detection but without correspondingly bright co emission .",
    "this list includes the z=4.3 radio galaxy 8c  1435 + 635 ( @xcite ) , the z=3.8 radio galaxy 4c  41.17 ( @xcite ) , and the z=2.8 radio galaxy mg  1019 + 0535 ( @xcite )  also see the review by evans ( 1997 ) .",
    "inferred dust masses of about @xmath6 are reported for these systems , but their dust masses are nearly unconstrained because their dust continuum detections in most cases are limited to just one or two data points near the peak of their dust spectrum ( @xmath109 m ) . existing co observations of these systems place rather large gas mass limits of about @xmath110 ( @xcite )  comparable to the most gas - rich galaxies in the local universe but probably not sufficient to detect the gas associated with the dust observed at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "these observations are still consistent with the formation of luminous galaxies in the early epochs .",
    "more sensitive co observations are needed for a better comparison of their gas and dust properties .",

    "<S> no line or continuum emission was detected , but the derived limits provide a useful constraint on the temperature , emissivity , and mass of the cold dust associated with fsc  15307 + 3252 and its molecular gas content .    the 3@xmath2 upper limit on the velocity integrated co ( 43 ) line flux is 1.6 jy  ( for @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a surprisingly small total molecular gas mass limit of @xmath4 for this galaxy with infrared luminosity @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with existing photometry data , our 3@xmath2 upper limit of 5.1 mjy for the 239 ghz ( 650 @xmath1 m rest wavelength ) continuum flux yields a total dust mass of 0.4 - 1.5 times @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the co luminosity ( thus molecular gas content ) and the resulting gas - to - dust ratio are lower than the values typical for the more gas - rich infrared galaxies , but they are within the observed ranges . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , fsc  15307 + 3252 has a dust content and infrared luminosity 40 and 200 times larger than the infrared bright elliptical - like galaxies ngc  1275 and cygnus  a.    the fir luminosity to dust mass ratios , @xmath7 , for all three galaxies hosting a powerful agn ( fsc  10214 + 4724 , fsc  15307 + 3252 , cygnus  a ) are larger than reasonably expected for a galaxy dominated by a starburst and four times larger than arp  220 . </S>",
