    "the fast development of the modern information technology raises the quest for advanced materials and new methods of nano - devices fabrication .",
    "a prominent topical example is graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystalline atomic layer system with charge carrier mobilities exceeding by far those of si  @xcite .",
    "this ideal two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) system exhibits unique properties for charge  @xcite and spin  @xcite transport .",
    "the spin property prompts applications in memory , sensor , and active spin - current based devices . for the latter",
    "the detrimental spin transport parameters like spin relaxation time and relaxation length have called for materials with negligible intrinsic spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions . here",
    "graphene appears as a prime spintronics candidate being gate tunable at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "thereby , graphene has also spurred the conjectured change in paradigm from charge - based electronics , i.e. transfer and storage of electron charges , to spintronics  @xcite based on the electron s spin .",
    "the progress in graphene - based devices  @xcite triggered the search for a suitable insulating substrate .",
    "the crystalline structure of wide band gap hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath0-bn ) is isomorphic to the structure of graphite making @xmath0-bn an ideal match to graphene .",
    "weak van der waals bonds between honeycomb @xmath0-bn sheets and the absence of surface states allow easy manipulations with exfoliated single or multilayers of @xmath0-bn .",
    "owing to these properties new physical phenomena  @xcite and new devices  @xcite became possible with exfoliated @xmath0-bn .",
    "in particular , superior charge and spin transport properties in graphene on @xmath0-bn  @xcite over graphene on amorphous sio@xmath1  @xcite are reported . in this case",
    ", the smoothening of graphene flakes by @xmath0-bn flakes has enabled significant improvements of spin lifetimes , spin relaxation lengths , and electron mobilities in co / mgo / graphene/@xmath0-bn spin - valve devices  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for spin injection into graphene it has been realized that @xmath0-bn with a large band gap of @xmath2ev  @xcite has the potential of replacing defective oxide tunnel barriers  @xcite . in view of early predictions by kirczenow  @xcite for metal/@xmath0-bn",
    "/ semiconductor interfaces the analogous barrier replacement could be assumed for magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) .",
    "currently , mtjs are made of ferromagnetic electrodes separated by al@xmath1o@xmath3 or a hygroscopic mgo barrier  @xcite .",
    "an attempt of making mtjs with cvd grown @xmath0-bn tunnel barriers has resulted in a rather low tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) of less than @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "such tmr is far below predicted values  @xcite due to contaminations during @xmath0-bn transfer .",
    "all these examples of excellent physical properties and specific device demonstrations by applying exfoliated @xmath0-bn are preceding the next stage in the development of van der waals materials : large scale and integrated device fabrication , requiring wafer scale fabrication methods of @xmath0-bn .",
    "recently , several approaches of epitaxial @xmath0-bn growth on close - packed surfaces of polycrystalline transition metals have been proposed including borasine - free chemical vapour deposition  @xcite , sputtering  @xcite , and molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe )  @xcite . in these publications",
    "mainly structural properties of epitaxial @xmath0-bn films have been addressed , while their electronic structures have not been reported yet .",

    "the elongated shape of the stripes could be attributed to a rough surface , which is typical for commercially available single crystals of metals .",
    "this pattern allows a preliminary conclusion that the epitaxial growth of bn takes place and that the surface morphology resembles that of single crystal ni(111 ) .",

    "this simple temperature treatment leads to the complete disappearance of the c @xmath15 peak and thus to desorption of the carbon - containing molecules ( co , co@xmath1 ) from the surface of @xmath0-bn , and the xps signal originating from oxygen is largely decreased .",
    "the positions of the n@xmath15 and b@xmath15 xps emission lines of the clean surface area are @xmath17ev and @xmath18ev , respectively , and these values are in a very good agreement with previously published data for the thick @xmath0-bn layer formed on polycrystalline surfaces of cu and ni  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0-bn film composition on the basis of the corresponding xps line intensities gives a stoichiometric compound within the error of the xps measurements ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the subsequent angular - resolved xps ( ar - xps ) measurements of the intensity of ni@xmath20 and n@xmath15 emission lines has been carried out ( see fig.s2 of supplementary material ) . in this measurement the probed thickness of the bn film is varied as a function of the angle @xmath21 between the sample plane and the direction to the energy analyzer . as a result the ar - xps method gives a thickness of the studied @xmath0-bn film of @xmath22 , which is in a good agreement with tem data ( @xmath23 ) in fig .",

    "further confirmation of the high crystalline quality of the obtained @xmath0-bn is revealed by nexafs experiments .",

    "these spectra demonstrate an example of the so - called _ search - light - like _ effect  @xcite , when the absorption intensity depends on the relative orientation of the electric field vector of the incoming light and the alignment of the orbital , onto which the electron is transferred from the respective core level .",
    "therefore , the nexafs peaks at @xmath26ev for n@xmath24 and @xmath27ev for b@xmath24 are assigned to the transitions of @xmath15 core electrons of corresponding atoms into the antibonding @xmath28 band of @xmath0-bn  @xcite . on the other hand , the high energy tails of both nexafs spectra",

    "these signatures underscore the ordered crystalline structure of our epitaxial @xmath0-bn on ni(111 ) having the electronic structure similar to that of bulk @xmath0-bn .",
    "the pre - edge structure in the nexafs spectra for both absorption edges originates from the interface states between @xmath0-bn and ni(111 ) as a result of the orbital mixing between ni@xmath30 and bn@xmath31 states  @xcite .",
