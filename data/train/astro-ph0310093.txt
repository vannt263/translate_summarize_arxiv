    "more than 500 pulsars are being regularly observed using the 76-m lovell radio telescope at jodrell bank observatory at frequencies between 408 and 1630mhz . this archive contains more than 5600 years of pulsar rotational history which we supplement , for 18 pulsars , with early observations from the jet propulsion laboratory ( downs & reichley 1983 ) to provide individual data spans of up to 34 years . in a series of three papers we plan to carry out a full analysis of the data for more than 350 pulsars that have been observed for longer than six years",
    "the first paper provides accurate timing solutions including proper motion measurements . in the second paper",
    "we will use these proper motion values to improve our understanding of pulsar velocities . in the third paper",
    "we will discuss the remnant structures in the timing residuals after fitting a timing solution for rotational frequency and its first derivative .",
    "some qualitative results , which will be discussed in more detail in the third paper , are highlighted here .",
    "many different structures are observed in the timing residuals , including cubic features , cusps , flat residuals , pseudo - sinusoids and more irregular features .",
    "cusps ( corresponding to a local maxima ) indicate the pulsar undergoing a glitch .",
    "pseudo - sinusoidal variations in the timing residuals may be caused by the pulsar precessing or from unmodelled binary companions .",
    "the amplitudes of the observed cubic structures are many orders of magnitude greater than those predicted from magnetic dipole radiation ; measured ` braking indices ' range between @xmath0 .",
    "the structures observed in the majority of the timing residuals are not time resolved .",
    "for example , about 30% are dominated by a large scale cubic feature and a further 40% currently have no clearly defined features .",
    "however , we have a sample of 29 pulsars for which it is possible to study individual features in detail .",
    "we find that the distribution of the residuals around the mean value has no general asymmetry ( with 15 having negative skew and 14 positive ) .",
    "we do find that 70% have , on average , sharper ( larger second derivative ) local maxima than local minima .",
    "no explanation is given for this effect at the present time .",
    "the time corresponding to the first local minima in the auto - correlation function of the timing residuals provides an estimate of the time ",
    "scale of the structures present .",
    "however , we see no correlation with this parameter and the observed or derived pulsar parameters .",
    "we do find strong correlations between the amplitude of the timing noise and the first and second rotational frequency derivatives ( figure 1 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our new sample of timing residuals that span up to @xmath130years will allow the first large scale analysis of timing noise to be carried out .",
    "already it is clear that many of the structures observed in the timing residuals can not have been caused by a simple ` noise ' process .",
    "many people have been involved in timing pulsars at jodrell bank .",
    "we thank , in particular , christine jordan for her work in developing much of the software used in the analysis of the observations ."
