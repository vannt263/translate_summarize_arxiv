    "the axisymmetric minimal area surface enclosing a volume @xmath0 will be necessarily doughnut - shaped as that one depict in fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) , as we will see by considering all solutions of our isoperimetric problem in the following section .",
    "strictly speaking , the isoperimetric problem , dating from the antiquity , concerns finding the plane figure of maximal area with a given perimeter . in a broader sense , however , it includes , for instance , the problem of finding the function @xmath20 which minimize a given functional [ e1 ] s[f ] = _ d l(x , y , f , f_x , f_y ) dxdy , but subjected to integral constraints of the type [ e2 ] _ d c(x , y , f , f_x , f_y ) dxdy = constant , where @xmath21 is a region of the plane @xmath22 and the indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the respective partial derivatives .",

    "the constant @xmath29 is to be determined , among all the integration constants , from the boundary conditions and the integral constraint ( [ e2 ] ) . for the problem of the minimal area axisymmetric surface",
    ", one can introduce appropriate polar coordinates @xmath30 centred at the surface such that @xmath31 , leading to the following expression for the area functional s[f ] = 2_d d , while the fixed volume constraint will read simply [ vol ] v[f ] = 2_d f d= constant .",

    "it is interesting to relate the topological transition of the minimal area surfaces to the dihedral angle @xmath12 between the tangent planes at the equatorial perimeter .",

    "[ fig0](a ) .",
    "the doughnut - shapes surface with the same volume has a larger dihedral angle , close to @xmath75 degrees ( fig . [",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "notice that = 8 - = 0.20577  corresponds to the volume of a lens - shaped surface with dihedral angle @xmath76 degrees at the equatorial external perimeter .",
    "notice that all solutions to our isoperimetrical problem are indeed constant mean curvatures .",
    "this can be checked by recalling the first and second , respectively , fundamental forms for our surface of revolution generated by @xmath49 : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ; and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ; and that - ( ) = + = 2h , where",
    "@xmath83 stands for the mean curvature of our surface .",
    "thus , the euler - lagrange equation ( [ el ] ) is equivalent to the constraint of constant @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath83 is constant , we can easily evaluate it by taking the point @xmath84 such that @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , leading simply to h = -f(| ) , which is positive for our toroidal surfaces .",
    "the mean curvature can be expressed also as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the radii corresponding to the principal curvatures .",
    "the @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) limit of figure ( [ fig3 ] ) , for which the external dihedral angle tends to 180 degrees , is an usual torus of circular section for which @xmath91 , assuring in this way that @xmath92 constant .",
    "we have shown that the isoperimetric problem of finding an asixymmetric minimal area surface enclosing a fixed volume @xmath0 and with a fixed equatorial perimeter @xmath1 exhibits a rather unexpected topological transition in their solutions accordingly to the ratio @xmath71 .",
    "the typical lens - shaped surfaces formed by two spherical caps are not the global minimum for small enclosed volumes @xmath0 .",
    "the global minimum for the axisymmetric case enclosing small volumes corresponds to toroidal surfaces .",
    "this situation considered here resemble in many ways the classical goldschmidt discontinuous minimal area surface of revolution limited by two coaxial rings separated by a distance @xmath93 @xcite . in our case , for @xmath0 below a critical value , we have two toroidal minimal area surfaces enclosing a given volume .",
    "one of them has area smaller than the corresponding lens - shaped surface , while the other has a greater superficial area . in the goldschmidt case , for @xmath93 below a certain critical value , we have always two minimal surfaces ( catenoids ) , but only one of them can effectively have a total superficial area smaller than the discontinuous goldschmidt solution .",
    "in fact , the diagram area @xmath94 for the catenoids is very similar to our area @xmath67 volume curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "finally , we can not ignore that a doughnut - shaped minimal area surface will be ultimately unstable due to phenomena like shrinking @xcite and plateau - rayleigh @xcite instabilities .",
    "this means that , for instance , if one deforms a bubble axisymmetricaly in such a way that its equatorial perimeter @xmath1 is enlarged while its volume @xmath0 is kept constant , the bubble will be inexorably destroyed when @xmath95 .",
    "if a doughnut - shaped bubble is formed , it will probably break apart in smaller daughter bubbles ( see , for similar behavior in another context , @xcite ) .",
    "it is not difficult to envisage a non - axisymmetric surface with fixed external perimeter @xmath1 , enclosing a volume @xmath3 and with area @xmath17 smaller than the area of our toroidal surface .",
    "consider , for instance , a sphere with a handle as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    , enclosing a volume @xmath3 , and with area @xmath17 smaller than our axisymmetric toroidal surface .",
    "axisymmetric surfaces are not global solutions for the problem . ]",
    "the external handle guarantees the constant perimeter constraint . by shrinking its smaller radius",
    ", its contribution for the total @xmath0 and @xmath17 will be arbitrarily small , and hence they will correspond to the sphere , which is known to be the global solution for the problem and will certainly encapsulate a given volume @xmath0 with surface area @xmath17 smaller than our doughnut - shaped surface .",
    "this kind of non - axisymmetric surface might arise from a plateau - rayleigh instability , where perturbations with wavelength greater than the smaller dimension of the toroidal surface could grow exponentially until disrupt it .",
    "the situation is more intricate , however , if one keeps the perimeter curve fixed , preventing in this way the formulation of an axisymmetric problem from the beginning . by similar arguments",
    ", we also expect genus 1 minimal area surfaces for small @xmath71 in this case , but the value of the threshold @xmath96 can be different . despite of being unstable as minimal area surfaces ,",
    "doughnut - shaped structures are quite common in many dynamical situations , ranging from stains left by a coffee droplet@xcite to extracellular polymeric bacterial coverages@xcite .",
    "in particular , toroidal liquid droplets have been obtained by exploring some pyroelectric effects on wetting processes @xcite .",
    "we think our result might be useful to shed more light on some of these problems .",
    "it is more convenient for our purposes to introduce some dimensionless quantities . from ( [ e15 ] )",
    ", one can introduce the dimensionless function @xmath97 [ a1 ] f ( ) = f ( ) , with [ a2 ] f(x ) = _ x_min^x ds .",
