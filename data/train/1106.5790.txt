    "since the cooling time at the core ( @xmath0  yr ) is much smaller than the age of the cluster ( @xmath1  yr ) , a substantial gas inflow , which was called a `` cooling flow '' , was expected to develop ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",

    "this model may work for clusters with a middle or high temperature if the conductivity is @xmath2% of the spitzer one @xcite .",
    "however , the conductivity requires fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the spitzer conductivity significantly decreases for low temperature clusters , thermal conduction may not be able to transfer enough energy .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , it has been observed that the agns disturb the surrounding icm ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it is not clear how the energy generated by the agn is transfered to the ambient icm . for example",
    ", sound waves observed around the agns in some clusters were considered the significant channel for the agn energy input into the icm @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical studies have indicated that the dissipation of the sound waves or weak shocks is too fast to heat an entire cool core and thus the waves can not stably heat the core ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "simultaneous heating by both the central agn and thermal conduction had been proposed by @xcite . in their model , mechanical heating through bubble motion was considered for the agn heating . since the advantage of cr streaming over the mechanical heating was not clear in the models of @xcite , it may be useful to study the case where a cool core is heated only by cr streaming .    in this study",
    ", we revisit the heating of the icm by cr streaming .",
    "we consider non - steady icm and investigate whether the cr streaming alone can stably heat the icm without the assistance of thermal conduction .",
    "we emphasize that we do not intend to search models in which the heating is completely balanced with radiative cooling . since the age of clusters is finite ( say @xmath4  gyr",

    "in general , models in which crs are injected in a too narrow region and/or the icm is too strongly heated tend to be unstable .",

    "even so , the ability to keep the icm stable for a long time makes cr streaming attractive as a heat source of cluster cores .",

    "development of a strong cooling flow is well prevented .",
    "cr streaming can effectively heat both high and low temperature clusters .",

    "<S> we study heating of cool cores in galaxy clusters by cosmic - ray ( cr ) streaming using numerical simulations . in this model , crs </S>",
    "<S> are injected by the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and move outward with alfvn waves . </S>",
    "<S> the waves are excited by the streaming itself and become non - linear . </S>",
    "<S> if magnetic fields are large enough , crs can prevail in and heat the entire core because of a large alfvn velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cr streaming can stably heat both high and low temperature clusters for a long time without the assistance of thermal conduction , and it can prevent the development of massive cooling flows . if there is even minor contribution of thermal conduction , the heating can be more stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the reason of the stability and indicate that the cr pressure is insensitive to the change of intracluster medium ( icm ) , and that the density dependence of the heating term is similar to that of the radiative cooling . </S>"
