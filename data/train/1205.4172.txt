    "a common restriction on the dependence structure is to assume that the growth of @xmath3 is asymptotically linear ( merlevde , peligrad and utev  @xcite ) .    for this particular situation ,",
    "there exist several results which guarantee the convergence of @xmath22 under sufficient conditions given in terms of mixing coefficients , linear dependence coefficients or in terms of the covariances where it is well known that if @xmath23 exists , then @xmath24 also exists in @xmath25 , and the two limits are equal ( @xcite , chapter 5 ) .    in terms of the spectral measure @xmath1 , ibragimov s  @xcite result states that when @xmath1 is absolutely continuous , a sufficient condition is the continuity of the spectral density @xmath26 at the origin , in which case @xmath27this follows from the following representation : @xmath28 and fejr s theorem on the cesro summability of the fourier series of the spectral density @xmath26 .",
    "the continuity of the spectral density @xmath26 at the origin is by no means necessary , and in fact hardy and littlewood  @xcite , theorem c , in 1924 proved that a necessary and sufficient condition is the convergence of @xmath29 which has appeared before in a probabilistic context  @xcite .    _ general case _ @xmath17 .",
    "necessary conditions usually require restrictive assumptions on the covariances such as regular variation in the zygmund sense .",

    "the case @xmath34 frequently occurs in _ long - range dependent _ time - series when the covariances are not summable or the spectral density has an appropriate singularity at the origin which often results in non - gaussian limiting behavior @xcite .",

    "_ it is not clear whether the approach of hardy and littlewood  @xcite ( and zygmund  @xcite ) , can handle the slowly varying function and the case @xmath36 .",

    ".    _ subsequences .",
    "_ subsequences @xmath37 have often been applied through the use of dyadic induction and stationarity , in the context of mixing conditions , martingale approximations , central limit theorems and invariance principles ; see @xcite .",
    "the question whether convergence along a subsequence is enough to guarantee convergence of the full sequence has been around for some time now , and it was presented to us as a conjecture by m. peligrad . although the answer is positive under extra conditions such as @xmath38-mixing , the necessary and sufficient condition stated in theorem  [ thmlimit ] allows us to construct a counterexample proving that convergence along dyadic subsequences does not imply convergence over the full sequence .",

    "thus , by monotonicity of @xmath56 and properties of slowly varying functions  @xcite , for @xmath67 , @xmath68    \\(2 ) @xmath64 ( 3 ) .",
    "we apply lemma  [ propn ] with @xmath69 to get @xmath70 using the change of variables @xmath71 and since @xmath72 , @xmath73 as @xmath18 , by the tauberian theorem ( @xcite , proposition 1.5.8 ) .",
    "therefore there is a constant @xmath41 such that @xmath74 which completes the proof since ( 3 ) @xmath64 ( 1 ) is obvious .",
