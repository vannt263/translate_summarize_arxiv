    "ultracold atomic gases provide a highly controllable experimental setting for studies of many - body quantum phenomena such as bose - einstein condensation  @xcite and superfluidity  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) . the physical phenomena studied in these systems",
    "are often analogous to those occurring in other many - body systems , in particular solid state materials and liquid helium .",
    "moreover , the flexibility in experimentally designing the geometry and interactions in atomic gases offers the possibility to experimentally access physical regimes which are of theoretical interest but could so far not be observed . at the same time , the experimental probes used in atomic physics are often quite different from those traditionally used in condensed matter experiments and discussed in the theoretical literature . in particular , for atomic gases there is no general experimentally established method allowing a quantitative measurement of the superfluid fraction , which is traditionally defined through the fluid s response to rotation and the emergence of a non - classical moment of inertia  @xcite . in classic experiments on liquid helium  @xcite ,",
    "under rotation of the walls of the container a perfect superfluid remains metastable in the zero angular momentum state as long as the rotation rate does not exceed the critical velocity for a superfluid flow .",
    "more generally , the fraction of the fluid which does not rotate with the walls quantitatively defines the superfluid fraction .",
    "only very recently some ideas on how to measure the superfluid fraction of an ultracold atomic gas have been formulated  @xcite . specifically , in ref .",
    "a spectroscopic method was proposed , which closely follows the traditional definition of the superfluid density but allows a signal readout which plays to the strengths of atomic physics .",
    "this proposal builds on the recent developments in the use of optical fields to induce artificial gauge fields for ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that if slow rotation of the gas is induced by an optical gauge field , this creates a natural coupling between the external ( angular momentum ) and the internal ( hyperfine ) atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "measuring the populations of hyperfine states in an atomic cloud then allows a direct readout of the angular momentum induced by the rotation , and thus a measurement of the moment of inertia and the superfluid fraction .",
    "the basic connection between the hyperfine populations and the superfluid fraction was pointed out in ref .   by considering the difference between a perfect superfluid with no angular momentum and a fully relaxed gas which exhibits the classical value of the moment of inertia .",
    "here we extend this theoretical work in several ways .",
    "first , we include in our calculations the effects of non - zero temperature and interactions in the gas , which broaden the distribution of angular momenta around zero for a metastable superfluid , and around the classical value set by the imposed rotation for a fully relaxed gas .",
    "this allows us to assess the quantitative accuracy of the proposed measurement , and to estimate the experimental parameters which in practice would allow a good compromise between the theoretical accuracy of the method and the experimentally relevant size of the readout signal .",
    "second , we explicitly calculate the expected experimental signal in two important cases : for a weakly interacting bose gas we show that the spectroscopically deduced superfluid fraction closely follows the condensate fraction below the critical temperature ; this confirms that the proposed method gives the expected result in this well understood limit .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit of strong interactions the superfluid and the condensate fraction of the gas can be quite different , as is known from the case of liquid helium  @xcite .",
    "we show that in this limit the spectroscopic measurement is sufficiently accurate to allow a clear experimental distinction between the two quantities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : set - up ] we lay out the theoretical background on the concept of superfluid density and its connection to hyperfine populations in an atomic cloud rotated with use of optically induced gauge potentials . in section  [ sec:3-level - system ]",
    "we give some more details on a specific implementation of gauge fields in an atomic system . in section",
    "[ sec : corrections ] we discuss the quantitative theoretical corrections to the mapping between the hyperfine populations and the superfluid fraction . to illustrate the effect of these corrections we first consider a normal gas at non - zero temperature",
    "; this already allows us to anticipate suitable experimental parameters which lead to sufficiently small theoretical inaccuracies and sufficiently large experimental signals . in section  [ sec : interactions ] we extend our calculations to interacting gases , at both zero and non - zero temperature .",
    "our results for the expected experimental signals in both weakly and strongly interacting gases are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] contains a summary of the paper .",
    "the concept of a superfluid density , or superfluid fraction , originates in the two - fluid model for the hydrodynamics of superfluid @xmath0he , proposed by tisza  @xcite and landau  @xcite . the fluid , of total density @xmath1 , is assumed to consist of a superfluid component , of density @xmath2 , which has vanishing viscosity and flows without dissipation , and a normal component , of density @xmath3 .",
    "landau proposed  @xcite how to measure these separate components .",
    "he envisaged taking superfluid helium at rest in its container , and slowly rotating the walls at a constant angular velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the normal component comes to rest with the rotating walls ; however , the superfluid component is unaffected and remains at rest . since only the normal component moves , the moment of inertia of the fluid",
    "is determined by @xmath5 , and its ratio to the expected classical moment of inertia ( defined by the total density @xmath1 ) provides the normal fraction @xmath6 and hence the superfluid fraction @xmath7 .",
    "note that it is necessary that the trap is _ not _ perfectly rotationally symmetric ( _ i.e .",
    "_ the walls must be rough ) , so that the normal fluid can relax into the steadily rotating state and come into equilibrium by changing its angular momentum .",
    "this method was implemented for superfluid helium in the classic experiments by andronikashvili  @xcite . in those experiments it was not the container that was rotated , but a stack of disks embedded in the fluid .",
    "still , the disks drag just the normal fluid , so measurements of the moment of inertia of the disks ( using a torsional oscillator ) allowed a determination of the normal and superfluid fractions .",
    "the non - classical moment of inertia arising from the superfluid component provides the standard definition of the superfluid fraction  @xcite . to discuss this theoretically ,",
    "it is customary to consider the fluid to be contained in a ring - shaped toroidal vessel with a radius @xmath8 much larger than its transverse dimensions @xmath9 , cf .",
    "[ fig : sketch1 ] .     with transverse dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the gauge potential introduced by light fields , corresponding to rotation with angular frequency @xmath12 .",
    "this induces a superfluid flow with speed @xmath13 in the direction opposite to @xmath11 . ]    in this case , the classical moment of inertia for @xmath14 atoms of mass @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "we shall assume this geometry throughout this paper  in part for theoretical simplicity , but also for practical reasons discussed further below .",
    "the superfluid fraction is then defined  @xcite by the average angular momentum @xmath17 picked up under rotation of the vessel with an angular frequency @xmath4 : @xmath18 the limit @xmath19 of slow rotation of the vessel is required such that the velocity of the walls of the container , @xmath20 , does not exceed the critical velocity of the superfluid , @xmath21 . since",
    "finite - size effects can be much more important in ultracold atomic gases than in typical experiments on superfluid helium , it is helpful to expand further on this point . for a very small rotation rate , namely when @xmath22 , even an _ ideal _ bose gas shows a non - classical moment of inertia , and could thus be considered to be superfluid  @xcite .",
    "( for @xmath23 , the lowest - energy single particle state remains the state with vanishing angular momentum , so an ideal condensate has @xmath24 . ) we define superfluidity in the strongest sense of ref .",
    ", which is the sense that is conventionally applied : the angular momentum is measured with an imposed rotation frequency in the range @xmath25 .",
    "the lower limit excludes the ideal bose gas as a superfluid . for a large system , @xmath26",
    ", this constitutes a wide range of frequencies . for a weakly interacting bose gas , @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 the healing length ) , and so the range of frequencies is wide for @xmath29 .",
    "this method could , in principle , be applied to ultracold atomic gases , using a rotating deformation of the trap to represent the rotating walls of the container . however , in practice this is difficult , as a measurement of the induced angular momentum or mass flow is difficult for ultracold gases . for harmonically",
    "trapped gases , an ingenious method of measuring the angular momentum has been applied  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical proposal has shown how the superfluid density could be extracted more generally if local imaging is possible  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore an alternative theoretical proposal  @xcite in which the rotation is simulated by an optically induced gauge field .",
    "a key feature of this method is that it allows one to measure the angular momentum _ spectroscopically _ and hence deduce the superfluid fraction of an ultracold atomic gas .",
    "the basis of the idea is the coupling of light with orbital angular momentum  @xcite to internal atomic spin states , thereby creating an azimuthal gauge field @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal gauge leads to the same effects as rotation , albeit in a slightly different manner . in the presence of the gauge field",
    "one must make a distinction between the `` canonical '' momentum @xmath30 and the `` kinetic '' momentum @xmath31 . in the absence of a gauge field , a superfluid that is at rest in the toroidal vessel",
    "has no winding number of its phase ( no vortices ) and corresponds to the case of vanishing canonical momentum @xmath32 .",
    "this does not change when the gauge field is introduced .",
    "however , as the gauge field is turned on , the superfluid picks up a non - zero velocity @xmath33 . on the other hand , for a normal fluid , as the gauge field is switched on , the fluid will always stay at rest with the walls of the container ( provided they are rough ) .",
    "thus , compared to the rotating container discussed above , here it is the superfluid that moves while the normal fluid stays at rest .",
    "the case of the gauge field is , in fact , exactly equivalent to a rotating vessel , but where one views the system in the rotating frame of reference and so experiences the trap ( and normal fluid ) to be at rest .    to make this discussion more precise , note that when the optically induced gauge field is on , the atoms experience an effective dispersion relation which can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular momentum in units of @xmath36 , such that it is quantized to integer values .",
    "@xmath37 is a new effective mass of the atoms , and @xmath38 is the rotational shift due to the gauge field .",
    "( we will derive this in the next section . )",
    "this effective dispersion is equivalent to an azimuthal gauge field @xmath39 .",
    "it corresponds to being in a frame of reference rotating with an effective angular velocity @xmath40 e.g.  a particle with @xmath41 will have an angular group velocity @xmath42 .",
    "following the above discussion , if @xmath43 is slowly increased from zero , the superfluid will remain in its original state with @xmath44 but will flow with speed @xmath45 in the direction opposite to @xmath11 , whereas the normal fluid will pick up an angular momentum of @xmath46 per particle but will stay at rest .",
    "a key feature of the proposal  @xcite is that since the gauge field is generated by mixing internal hyperfine states of the atoms , this provides a natural coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "spectroscopically measuring the population of the different internal spin states allows the average angular momentum per atom @xmath47 to be deduced .",
    "we will focus on the population difference of the hyperfine states @xmath48 and @xmath49 in a three - level system , but this could be adapted to other internal structures .",
    "( the three - level system will be described in further detail in the next section . ) for a single atom with angular momentum @xmath35 we define the population difference as @xmath50 a measurement of the populations @xmath51 and @xmath52 for a gas of such atoms leads to the fractional population difference @xmath53 , which may be expressed in terms of @xmath54 as @xmath55}{\\sum_\\ell \\langle n_\\ell\\rangle}\\\\    & = \\frac{\\sum_\\ell \\langle n_\\ell\\rangle \\delta p_\\ell}{\\sum_\\ell \\langle n_\\ell\\rangle } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] within the assumption that @xmath54 can be expanded to first order , @xmath56 one can deduce the angular momentum expectation value @xmath57 putting this back into eq .",
    ", one gets @xmath58 where the appropriate moment of inertia @xmath59 has been used . for a perfect superfluid we would expect to find @xmath60 , whereas for a normal fluid",
    "we would expect to find @xmath61 , thus allowing us to distinguish between the two .",
    "the main goal of this paper will be to analyse the _ quantitative _ accuracy of ( [ eq : superfluid - measurement ] ) , allowing for corrections that arise from the higher - order terms that are neglected in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : effective - dispersion],[eq : dp - single ] ) .",
    "however , for now , note that the spectroscopic technique should show a clear _ qualitative _ signature of superfluidity .",
    "for a normal fluid ( or the normal fraction ) , it does not matter in which order one increases @xmath38 and cools the gas to its final temperature : that is , these two operations `` commute '' .",
    "however , for the superfluid fraction these operations do not commute : if one first cools at @xmath62 and then imposes non - zero @xmath38 , the superfluid is pushed into a ( metastable ) state in which it is moving with respect to the walls of the container ; if one first imposes non - zero @xmath38 and then cools , the superfluid will be formed at rest with respect to the walls .",
    "thus , depending on the order , the system is led either to the non - relaxed metastable superfluid condensed in a state of vanishing ( canonical ) angular momentum @xmath63 , which we label `` sf '' , or to the relaxed superfluid , condensed in the ground state @xmath64 , which we label `` rsf ''",
    ". the two cases will have different fractional hyperfine populations , @xmath65 , so the change in population allows a clear qualitative signature of metastable superfluid flow .",
    "there are several well - established theoretical proposals for how optical fields can be used to create fictitious gauge fields in neutral atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "the scheme we follow here is closely related to that implemented in the experiments of the nist group  @xcite .",
    "however , it is adapted to generate an azimuthal vector potential , by using optical beams with orbital angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "as described above , throughout this work we assume that the gas is confined in a toroidal trap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch1 ] ) with radius @xmath8 large compared to its transverse dimensions @xmath9 .",
    "this simplifies the experimental implementation of the azimuthal gauge field , as it will be sufficient to require that the optical fields are uniform only over the range @xmath9 .",
    "we consider atoms with three hyperfine levels  @xcite in their electronic ground state , e.g.  @xmath66na with @xmath67 .",
    "the degeneracy of the three hyperfine states @xmath68 is lifted by applying a weak external magnetic field @xmath69 , thereby inducing a zeeman shift @xmath70 with an energy gap @xmath71 between the hyperfine states .",
    "these states are coupled by two co - propagating laguerre - gauss beams with frequencies @xmath72 and orbital angular momenta @xmath73 .",
    "the frequencies are chosen such that they are detuned from any actual electronic transition , thus single - photon transitions are suppressed . instead ,",
    "the hyperfine states are coupled by two - photon raman transitions , cf .",
    "[ fig : raman ] .        for every two - photon transition",
    "the atom experiences a net change in its centre of mass angular momentum of @xmath74 , while the change in linear momentum can be neglected .",
    "hence there exists a coupling between @xmath75 and @xmath76 as well as between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the two light beams are slightly detuned from the raman two - photon resonance , with detuning @xmath78 . including the kinetic energies of the different angular momentum states and applying the rotating wave approximation  @xcite ,",
    "one arrives at the full hamiltonian , @xmath79 , @xmath80 the @xmath35 dependence has been made explicit ; each atomic state is defined by the amplitudes of the three hyperfine states and its angular momentum @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath81 is the two - photon rabi frequency which describes the coupling between hyperfine states .",
    "the effect of the zeeman splitting is given by @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "for each @xmath35 there are three energy eigenvalues of ( [ eq : model - hamiltonian ] ) , corresponding to three dressed energy bands .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energybands ] , we show the results of a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian  .    .",
    "the smooth curves interpolate between the allowed integer values of @xmath35 . ]",
    "the three uncoupled energy levels for @xmath83 are shown as dotted lines .",
    "when the light is on , @xmath84 , these levels are mixed and lead to the energy levels of the dressed states ( solid lines ) . for non - zero detuning @xmath82 the minimum of the lowest band",
    "is displaced to a non - zero angular momentum @xmath85 .",
    "provided that all atoms are restricted to states in the lowest - energy dressed band , the atoms experience an effective dispersion relation of the form ( [ eq : effective - dispersion ] ) in which the non - zero @xmath38 plays the role of an azimuthal gauge field .    throughout this paper , we assume that only this lowest dressed band is occupied .",
    "this is justified if the chemical potential @xmath86 and temperature @xmath87 are small compared to the band splitting , which is of order @xmath88 .",
    "hence we require that @xmath89 be sufficiently large .",
    "the lowest band will be referred to as @xmath90 in section  [ sec : interactions ] . to obtain the results shown in section  [ sec : results ] , we determine @xmath90 by numerical solution of . however , to allow an understanding of the general trends , we derive some analytic expressions which are valid for large @xmath89 , where the bands are far apart from each other and the lowest band is nearly parabolic . perturbation theory in @xmath91 shows  @xcite that the minimum of the dispersion relation is shifted from @xmath41 to @xmath92 and the bare mass is increased to an effective mass @xmath37 , with @xmath93 similarly , perturbative calculations of @xmath94 and @xmath95 show that they have equal and opposite contributions linear in @xmath35 .",
    "the difference @xmath96 can indeed be written as a series in @xmath35 , as in eq .  , with @xmath97 + { \\cal o}(1/\\omega_r^3 ) , \\\\",
    "\\delta p ' & \\simeq - \\sqrt{2 } \\frac{\\hbar\\delta\\ell}{m r^2 \\omega_r } + { \\cal o}(1/\\omega_r^2 ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as parameters representative of experiments , throughout this paper we consider sodium with @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 is the proton mass ) in a trap of radius @xmath100 .",
    "a typical value of the effective mass is @xmath101 ( at a two - photon rabi frequency @xmath102 and for @xmath103 ) .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have summarised the theoretical proposal of ref .  .",
    "this showed how to relate the superfluid fraction to a spectroscopically determined hyperfine population imbalance [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : superfluid - measurement ] ) ] .",
    "the quantitative accuracy of this relation relies on the validity of the termination of the taylor expansions in eqs .   and   at quadratic and linear orders respectively .",
    "if these ( terminated ) expansions were exact , the superfluid fraction would be perfectly determined by eq .  .",
    "in practice , higher - order corrections do exist , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 correspond to the lower - order expansions and  .",
    "the higher - order corrections have two major implications .",
    "firstly , corrections to @xmath54 of quadratic or higher order in @xmath35 lead to a deviation of the spectroscopic measurement [ the right - hand side of eq .  ] from the actual average angular momentum @xmath107 .",
    "secondly , corrections to the effective kinetic energy @xmath108 of cubic or higher order in @xmath35 mean that even the very definition of the superfluid fraction , eq .  , breaks down .",
    "a basic assumption of this definition is that the rotational properties of a ( normal ) gas are entirely characterised by its moment of inertia .",
    "this is correct provided the kinetic energy is a quadratic function of the angular momentum .",
    "then , under a transformation to a frame rotating at angular frequency @xmath109 , the interaction energy is unchanged , and the ( parabolic ) kinetic energy transforms as @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for a state of given average angular momentum , the only material property characterising the net energy change is the moment of inertia @xmath111 . for non - parabolic kinetic energy ,",
    "however , the kinetic energy does not transform in any simple way , but depends on the populations of the individual angular momentum states and hence also on how interactions and/or temperature have distributed particles among these levels .",
    "the moment of inertia of even a normal gas can not be assumed simply to be a constant @xmath111 .",
    "we now turn to estimate the quantitative effects of these two forms of correction .",
    "first we consider the effects of the higher - order corrections to @xmath54 , eq .  ( [ eq : dpell - corrections ] ) . because of the departure of @xmath54 from its linear expansion",
    ", we find @xmath112 .",
    "this difference is illustrated for different combinations of @xmath89 and @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : boltzmann ] , where the dashed lines show @xmath114 and the circles show the actual difference @xmath115 . as a consequence , eq",
    ".   would give a systematically incorrect result even in the @xmath116 limit .",
    "in practice this can be corrected by replacing the denominator in   by @xmath115 .",
    "a more serious problem arises from the fact that non - zero temperature and/or interactions populate a range of @xmath35 states . due to this broadening of the distribution function , the higher - order corrections to @xmath54 in eq .",
    "lead to the situation that for a normal gas ( or a relaxed superfluid ) with average momentum @xmath117 , the spectroscopic signal @xmath53 is not just determined by the signal of the state at @xmath38 , but depends on the overall distribution function , so @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , for the ( metastable ) superfluid with @xmath119 , one has @xmath120 .",
    "hence one would incorrectly determine the superfluid fraction . in order to estimate the size of this error",
    ", we here consider the effect of temperature using the example of an ideal boltzmann gas .",
    "( interactions will be considered in sections  [ sec : interactions ] and  [ sec : results ] . )",
    "we populate the different @xmath35 states in the lowest band ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : energybands ] ) according to a boltzmann distribution @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "the results are shown for a range of temperatures by the solid lines in fig .",

    "increasing @xmath113 has the opposite effect .",
    "one goal of this paper is to find parameters for which a good compromise can be reached , such that there is both a large experimental signal and small systematic inaccuracies . for @xmath125 , the influence of @xmath89 and @xmath113 on signal strength and higher - order corrections can be seen in the expressions from perturbation theory . using the perturbative expansions in @xmath91 ( cf .",

    "one would thus try to make @xmath113 as high as possible , and then increase @xmath89 as long as the signal size remains big enough . as a reasonable , and experimentally feasible , compromise we choose @xmath103 and @xmath102 [ as in fig .",
    "[ fig : boltzmann ]  ( c ) ] .",
    "these are the values we will use through the remainder of this paper .",
    "second , and finally , we return to the definition of superfluidity in eq .  , and estimate its adequacy . measuring the relative deviation",
    "@xmath130 is a way to assess the departure from parabolicity due to the terms of @xmath108 which are odd in @xmath35 . for the boltzmann gas of fig .",
    "[ fig : boltzmann ] , the relative deviation is maximal at @xmath131 ( with a maximum value @xmath132 ) and decreases with higher @xmath82 . at @xmath133  @xcite ,",
    "the maximum value of the deviation at @xmath134 is about @xmath135 . to further quantify the size of non - parabolic corrections to the dispersion relation , we have carried out fourth - order perturbation theory  @xcite in @xmath91 .",
    "the next terms in the series in @xmath35 are @xmath136 where both coefficients have higher - order contributions of @xmath137 .",
    "the contributions of cubic and quartic term relative to the parabolic term ( @xmath138 ) are of order @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "this is on the same order as the @xmath135 estimated above : for @xmath133 and @xmath141 , the root mean square angular momentum is @xmath142 , so we would expect the relative correction due to the cubic term to be about @xmath143 .",
    "this deviation of the dispersion relation from parabolicity sets an upper bound to the accuracy with which one can determine the superfluid fraction .",
    "in addition to the effects of non - zero temperature on a normal fluid , we want to know what happens to @xmath53 due to interactions in a superfluid . it is important to note that a gas is only superfluid _ because _ of interactions ; in the limit of vanishing interaction strength , the critical velocity ( see below , section  [ sec : critical - velocity ] ) goes to zero , so a metastable superfluid flow can not be maintained .",
    "here we do not attempt a full model of the interacting gas in a trap .",
    "rather , we aim to use a method that includes interactions in the simplest way .",
    "we therefore consider an interacting gas with _ uniform _",
    "the density inhomogeneity near the walls is on the scale of the healing length @xmath144 , which is the distance over which the condensate recovers its bulk value from zero density at the walls .",
    "we assume that @xmath145 and that we can thus neglect the density inhomogeneity .",

    "since we neglect density inhomogeneities , we consider the system to be uniform and impose periodic boundary conditions in the transverse directions . for @xmath150 we can unroll the angular momentum from the circumferential direction of the torus onto a line with periodic boundary conditions , equivalent to a linear momentum @xmath151 , where @xmath35 is the angular momentum ( in units of @xmath36 ) defined above .",
    "with this understanding we will use @xmath35 and @xmath152 interchangeably .",
    "we are only interested in the azimuthal motion , @xmath152 or @xmath35 , in which we would like to measure superfluidity",

    ", we find that ( for the parameters studied ) , a good choice is @xmath289 between @xmath337 and @xmath338 . in this range , the signal size is @xmath339 ; the spectroscopically measured superfluid fraction is accurate to about @xmath340 ( much less than the depleted fraction of @xmath341 ) ; the accuracy remains at this level up to @xmath342 .",
    "in summary , we have assessed the feasibility of a recent proposal  @xcite to measure the superfluid fraction of atomic becs .",
    "this proposal involves the use of optically induced gauge fields to simulate rotation , and allows the superfluid response to appear in a spectroscopic signal .",
    "we have calculated the expected spectroscopic signatures for three - dimensional becs with uniform density .",
    "one conclusion of our studies is the demonstration that this technique can be used to obtain a _ qualitative _ experimental signature of the superfluid response ( by comparing the spectroscopic signals when the order of turning on the gauge field and cooling the gas is reversed ) , with a spectroscopic signal that is large enough to be detectable in experiment .",
    "furthermore , and most importantly , we have shown that the technique can be used to extract a _ quantitative _ measurement of the superfluid density .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement technique can be improved at the expense of the size of the signal . using realistic values for the experimental parameters",
    ", we have shown that a compromise can be reached where both ( i )  the signal is sufficiently large to be feasible to measure and ( ii )  the superfluid density is determined to sufficient accuracy to allow quantitatively useful information to be extracted .",
    "notably , our results show that the technique can allow a clear experimental measurement of the distinction between condensate and superfluid fraction of a strongly interacting bose gas .",
    "our results support the usefulness of this technique  @xcite for measuring the superfluid fraction , and provide guidance for the parameters required in future experimental implementations .",
    "ince we assumed that the condensate is in @xmath189 , the last term of @xmath216 in  ( [ eq : bogoliubov - parameters ] ) refers to the condensate state ; in general the argument to @xmath345 has to be changed appropriately : @xmath346 -    \\epsilon^0(\\vecb{p}_c)$ ] .            or the parameters used , this is indistinguishable from the condensate density determined by self - consistently solving eq .",
