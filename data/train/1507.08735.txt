    "the aim of this paper is to apply ideas from study of legendrian singularities to a specific example of interest within mirror symmetry . in the papers",
    "@xcite , we introduced a class of legendrian singularities of a simple combinatorial nature , called arboreal singularities for their relations to trees , then presented an algorithm to deform any legendrian singularity to a nearby legendrian with arboreal singularities .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the category of microlocal sheaves on the original legendrian singularity is equivalent to that on the nearby legendrian .    we will not directly use the above theory , but will rather extract and apply one of its key constructions , formalized in lemma  [ arb lemma ] below .",
    "it enables the calculation of microlocal sheaves on an @xmath5-dimensional legendrian singularity in terms of constructible sheaves on an @xmath5-dimensional ball . for general legendrian singularities ,",
    "an inductive application of this construction leads to the algorithm presented in  @xcite .",
    "but for legendrian singularities that are simply cones over smooth manifolds , a single application suffices to give appealing results .    in this paper",
    ", we will implement this on a single example : the landau - ginzburg @xmath0-model with background @xmath6 and superpotential @xmath7 .",
    "( natural generalizations will appear in forthcoming work  @xcite . ) beyond the specific calculation , our aim is to advocate for the elementary tools used to describe the symplectic geometry .",
    "due to the fact that the critical locus @xmath8 is not smooth or proper , there has not yet appeared a definitive account of this landau - ginzburg @xmath0-model .",
    "nevertheless , it should not be too complicated since it is expected to be mirror to the @xmath3-model of the pair - of - pants @xmath9 . for further discussion , we recommend the beautiful paper  @xcite establishing mirror symmetry in the other direction , between the landau - ginzburg @xmath3-model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the @xmath0-model of @xmath9 .",
    "( there is also work in progress  @xcite pursuing results parallel to those of this paper but from a more traditional perspective . )",
    "our starting point will be the following viewpoint on the @xmath0-model .",
    "the superpotential @xmath12 suggests a natural conic lagrangian skeleton @xmath13 which can be regarded as a singular thimble over a nearby vanishing two - torus @xmath14 .",
    "we would like to study a model of @xmath0-branes running along @xmath15 ( as found in the infinitesimal fukaya - seidel category  @xcite ) or transverse to @xmath15 ( as found in the partially wrapped fukaya category  @xcite ) . for the moment , let us suggest a model for the first version , but see remark  [ rem versions ] for the modifications that lead to a model of the second .",
    "the landau - ginzburg @xmath0-model of @xmath6 with superpotential @xmath7 is given by the dg category of microlocal sheaves along the conic lagrangian skeleton @xmath16 .",
    "the ansatz is compatible with the broad expectation that given @xmath16 a conic lagrangian skeleton of an exact symplectic manifold , there should be many equivalent approaches to its  quantum category \" of @xmath0-branes : the floer - fukaya - seidel theory of lagrangian intersections and pseudo - holomorphic disks  @xcite ( analysis ) ; the kashiwara - schapira  @xcite theory of microlocal sheaves  @xcite ( topology ) ; and the theory of holonomic modules over deformation quantizations , exemplified by @xmath17-modules  @xcite .",
    "the close relation between the last two stems from the riemann - hilbert correspondence  @xcite , and there are numerous confirmations of their close relation with the first , including proposals within the context of mirror symmetry  @xcite to regard @xmath0-branes as microlocal sheaves as in the ansatz .",
    "now we can state the main theorem of this paper .",
    "it is a combinatorial calculation of microlocal sheaves along the conic lagrangian skeleton @xmath16 leading to a verification of its expected mirror symmetry with the @xmath3-model of the pair - of - pants @xmath9 .",
    "fix a field @xmath18 of characteristic zero .",
    "introduce the base space @xmath19 , its cotangent bundle @xmath20 , and its spherically projectivized cotangent bundle @xmath21 .",

    "it is nothing more than the dg enhancement of the bounded derived category of finite - dimensional @xmath18-vector spaces @xmath27 equipped with an automorphism @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath30 .",
    "[ intro main thm ] there is an equivalence @xmath31    [ rem versions ] this comment falls within the  categorical functional analysis \" underpinning observed dualities between infinitesimal fukaya - seidel categories and partially wrapped fukaya categories , and similarly between properly - supported coherent complexes and perfect complexes ( as established in  @xcite ) .",
    "we have selected the formulation of the theorem from among a collection of closely related assertions .",
    "it is the version that matches with the definition of microlocal sheaves that includes the traditional local finiteness of constructibility .",
    "alternatively , one can take the left hand side to consist of arbitrarily large complexes but nevertheless with the prescribed singular support .",
    "our arguments then provide an equivalence of this with a right hand side comprising all quasi - coherent complexes @xmath32 .",
    "going further , for example by passing to compact objects , one can arrive at a version involving specifically coherent complexes @xmath33 . taking a step back ,",
